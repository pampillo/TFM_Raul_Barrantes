<TEXT> I don't agree that its the same path, though there are parallels. 

Firstly, receivers can already transition to T2 with no change to any other system, since T2 devices will work on T networks. Secondly, when DVB-T is switched off, dongles to adapt existing hardware can be very cheaply bought and painlessly installed.

As far as the technology to transition to, I expect FTA to be around for at least the next decade, especially with the state of NBN mismanagement. We currently have enough spare spectrum capacity to do the parallel transition, but if we move to higher definitions before doing so, we may not have that luxury. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not all existing DVB-T cards/hardware support H.264. DVB-T2 is about 30% more efficient, supports more streams = more channels, is much more resilient, so better reception for fixed antennas and will enable portable/mobile TV. All of this will start mattering more as we transition to 4 and 8HD, which will require new hardware anyway.

DVB-T2 receivers are backwards compatible with DVB-T, so to transition, announce the change and get vendors to stop selling DVB-T hardware. Run DVB-T and T2 in parallel for a fixed transition period, then switch off DVB-T. Some existing hardware can be upgraded, others can use a cheap dongle to support the new standard.

<TEXT> The networks insisted on staying with DVB T and shoehorning MPEG 4 onto it instead of switching to DVB T2. That way they can fill the spectrum with quasi HD channels so no new stations can be added.

Basically, it's a way of making sure Australia won't ever get more channels. The only way we'll get more FTA content is by retiring old channels and replacing them.

Hard to imagine why the Gov't would agree to such a mess, but they did. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's pretty unfair to McMahon, and arguably Abbott.

McMahon was hated by his own party and others for being a liar, a leaker, a plotter, and for having no vision for his team or country, but he didn't actually do much damage while he was PM. In fact, Whitlam inherited a country that had a surplus and very good schools, infrastructure etc.

Likewise Abbott was certainly one of the more malevolent PMs, but despite his intentions, he didn't really do much damage while PM. True, there was the carbon "tax" repeal, but that had arguably alread been gutted even before Abbott took power and put it out of its misery. And Abbott at least was a man who acted on his convictions.

Turnbull though, has done enormous damage to the nation, from gutting NBN, wrecking ABS and CSIRO, wasting everybody's time and goodwill with marriage equality, to abandoning the reef to coalies and more. 

And worse, Turnbull has done it with full knowledge of the harm he's choosing to do. Before his Faustian ascension he spoke against almost all of the policy he's since enacted. He's skewered this country and its people for his own personal gain, and for that he deserves to be remembered as our worst PM ever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What we need to do instead is gut and/or nationalise the insurance industry in Australia, starting with the parasitic health insurers.

Having a national domestic insurance system that's designed to protect and benefit the people of Australia would go a long way to standardising the motor vehicle, household and other personal liability insurances that are currently designed to be so wordy and impenetrable that it's hard to tell what's actually covered.

Marketing campaigns promote a product through different media, including television, radio, print and online platforms. **Campaigns don't have to rely solely on advertising** and can also include demonstrations, word of mouth and other interactive techniques. Businesses operating in highly competitive markets may initiate frequent marketing campaigns and devote significant resources to generating brand awareness and sales. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, it's been bouncing around for years - nobdy wants to finance it except the LNP.


From 2015:

Five leading global banks - Citibank, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays - had declined to fund the project citing decline in coal mining in Australia, coal prices falling by 50 per cent and environmental issues, he said. 


http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/state-bank-of-indias-loan-to-adani-group-questioned-in-rajya-sabha/articleshow/45294506.cms

Eleven major international lenders have now publicly stated that they will not finance the $16.5 billion project, and at least one analyst says more delays could see the Indian company behind it ultimately scrap the development.

It is supposed to be the biggest thermal coal (used in power stations) project in Australian history, but the challenges facing Indian company Adani's coal project in the Galilee Basin keep mounting.

Three major French investment banks - BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole and Societe General - have sent letters ruling out funding the development.

These three banks play a very significant role in financing the fossil fuel industry in Australia, particularly coal mining.

Westpac didn't withdraw support because of environmental lobbying. They just joined the rapidly growing list of financial institutions that have assessed the economics of the project and decided it wasn't viable.

Ok? Even established coal financiers don't want to touch it. Westpac was already joining the exit queue, and trying to spin up a bit of positive PR on its way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As for it being a defeat it's commemorated rather than celebrated and serves to remind people not only about the tenacity of the Anzacs but also what a terrible thing war is. 

Actually, it's celebrated because Keith Murdoch, an Australian journo with strong political connections, agreed to do a favour for a British journo and carry a letter that was intensely critical of the British military commanders in Gallipoli to the British Prime Minister. He was waylaid by military agents before he got to Britain, and the letter was taken from him.

That pissed him off, so he rewrote the letter from memory with a lot of embellishments praising the Aussie and Kiwi soldiers, and completely bagging the Brit generals. He gave the letter to the British PM, who was a mate of his, the Aussie PM, who was also a mate, and also one of the major newspaper empire owners, who was his boss.

When the story got out, and people realised what a fuckup the campaign was, the pollies decided it was better to run with the "Glorious ANZACs" story than the "Holy shit we're bad at this" story.

The rest, as they say, is history.

Sad and pointless. 

**Why wont he go away?**

I just dont think he has the imagination to go away  and what other life has he got apart from this? I think he actually cuts quite a sad figure these days. He had his moment, he was shit at it and they got rid of him before the Australian people could dispatch him. And thats what hes got to live with.

<TEXT> Still apparently not a path to a baked-crust scenario:

Conceivable levels of human-made climate forcing could yield the low-end runaway greenhouse. A forcing of 1216 W m2 would require carbon dioxide (CO2) levels to increase 816 times. If the forcing were due only to CO2 change, this would raise the global mean temperature by 1624 C with much larger polar warming. A warming of 1624 C produces a moderately moist greenhouse, with water vapour increasing to about 1% of the atmosphere's mass, thus increasing the rate of hydrogen escape to space. If such a forcing were entirely due to CO2, the weathering process would remove the excess atmospheric CO2 on a time scale of 10^4  10^5 years, well before the ocean was significantly depleted. Venus-like conditions on the Earth require a large long-term forcing that is unlikely to occur until the sun brightens by a few tenths of a percent, which will take a few billion years.[10] </TEXT>

The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) is the one most similar to what we're going to have happen, and we're in the process of putting the same materials into the atmosphere, just a lot faster than nature did back then.

In fact, the long-term result will be an oceanic oxygen-starvation event that will lay down new beds of carbon-rich shales and organic layers that will eventually become coal and oil to fuel the next cycle. 

Hopefully our replacements will do a bit better.

There are many opportunities for Australia's government to manage the bubble burst to protect homeowners as opposed to investors. The reasons they're not making those choices include most politicians also being the same wealthy developers who benefit from the shameful scam in the first place.

In the WA election, there was no equivalent wrecking ball, so the mining companies attacked Grylls directly.


Mr Grylls also says he has no regrets as he wasn't "just applying for a job" and was trying to be a policy maker.

"The people that won the election didn't put a solution forward to the state's finances - the people that did got their heads chopped off," he told the broadcaster.

"I'm happier to have tried to put forward the plan and lose than sit quietly in the corner and win."

He estimates the Chamber of Minerals and Energy spent $5 million on its campaign against the policy,

* Curator SB Singh banned Australian players from taking photographs of the wicket on Tuesday

* Singh prepared three wickets for India to choose from, and confirmed to Australian media yesterday that the BCCI is indeed responsible for making the final call.


* In Australia, the concept of choosing or ordering pitches is unheard of, with local curators the sole decision-makers.

Additional comments from journalists include: 

The match pitch looked as though it had been played on, with what appeared like footmarks already present.

How do you feel about what's happening in Myanmar? A bit meh?

Killings, beatings, rape, sexual violence, shootings, stabbings, and wholesale destruction of home and property. 52 of the 101 women interviewed reported being raped or subjected to sexual violence. Seven of them were girls who had been gang-raped. Some of the raped girls and women were killed afterwards.

The report contains many personal stories. A woman said, They killed the baby by stomping on it with their heavy boots. Then they burned the house.

A 12-year-old boy said: I was at home with my 13-year old uncle, when the army broke into the house. They beat us with sticks, metal rods and kicks. We were crying, pleading for mercy. An army officer hit me hard with a metal rod on my right arm, causing severe injury. We were dragged out of the house, which was set on fire. My uncle, who attempted to flee was caught, beaten and thrown into a burning house. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's an industry average, and includes amortised costs of older plants still being built/running. 

New installs are already below $100/WMh, with onshore costs even lower.

Vattenfall's record-low offshore wind price of 37.2 ore per kWh [49.9 euros/MWh, $53/MWh] for the 600 MW Kriegers Flak project has shown how falling costs and new tenders are spurring intense price competition in the offshore wind market. Other projects, such as those in deep UK waters, are going ahead at higher cost, and this explains why the global benchmark, while falling rapidly, is well above these recent figures from Denmark and the Netherlands.


The unsubidized LCOE for wind energy ranged from $32/MWh to $77/MWh in 2015,

<TEXT> I know that article, it's trotted out by nuclear power astroturfers at every opportunity.


Problem is, it was based on Brian Wang's analysis in 2011, and is long obsolete given how much new wind and solar has been installed.


Even when it was written, some of the early criticisms were that it didn't account for lifecycle statistics, which meant that construction fatalities in new renewable industries weighted more heavily than those in nuclear generation, which has been running far longer, as well as unrelated accidents, such as road deaths, that were counted against renewable industries. Likewise fatalities incurred in very small scale remote area, marine, and industrial installs that aren't part of mainstream electricity production were counted against renewables.


TLDR: It's and old and busted news story. You should stop using it and find something better. If you can.

<TEXT> Huh, Did you RTFA? 

This article is about cost, not capacity contribution. It shows that falling construction costs for building offshore turbines makes them as cheap or cheaper than nuclear or coal. The cost is also still falling, making it possible for companies to sell offshore wind power at close to half the price of nuclear.



Vattenfall AB last year agreed to supply power from turbines in the North Sea at 60 euros ($64) a megawatt-hour in 2020. 


EIA estimated the total system cost for an advanced nuclear energy facility to be $108 per megawatt-hour of electricity produced, compared with solar energy at $144 per MWh; and offshore wind at $221 per MWh. Onshore wind is less costly, at $86 per MWh, but its also less efficient.

<TEXT> The inability to backtrack or apologise is somewhat inherent to conservatism.

The researchers concluded that not only are conservatives less prone to apology, but also less moved by someone else's apology.



Hornsey tried to offer initial explanations. It seems that conservatives are more hierarchical and accept power difference more readily. So if I hurt someone lower than me, ach, that's the way of the world.


That lends them a propensity to malicious schadenfreude when the opportunity arises, and some of what we're seeing is basically gloating at the adversity they're creating for those they see as powerless people.

Having said that I have no doubt that all of your choices and more are in play in the current situation. They're not mutually exclusive.

<TEXT> This is a really insightful paper, with lessons for other grid-style utilities.

A study of the electricity, gas and water industries undertaken by the Australia Institute found that the number of technical and trades workers employed in these industries had grown by less than the workforce as a whole between 1997 and 2012 (28 per cent as opposed to 37 per cent). 

By contrast, the number of managers had more than doubled, HR and marketing professionals had more than tripled, and the number of sales workers had risen by 500 per cent. At the beginning of the period, technicians outnumbered managerial and retail staff. By the end, the reverse was
true.

Basically, despite the claims of efficiency,  privatisation meant that maintainers were replaced by salespeople. 

The physical network is a natural monopoly which means the market is best served by a single set of wires or pipes. In the absence of regulation, a monopolist will charge prices that are too high, with the result that they will not perform their signalling functions properly. Consumers will get less than they should at a higher price, profits will be excessive and investment will be distorted. 

These problems can be reduced, though not eliminated completely, by comprehensive price regulation. But when privatised firms are regulated in this way, their primary incentive is to game the system to secure higher returns.

This is fundamental to the problem. The only way to prevent profiteering from a natural monopoly is price regulation, but once you establish price regulation, the monopolist's goal is to reduce investment in maintenance and upgrades. This is why NBN fails, why AEMO fails, why private health insurance fails, why all of the planned privatisations will also fail.

This article should be nailed to Turnbull's forehead. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Economics can tell you a risk exists, and if there is a correction it will likely be intense and widespread

Economics can also tell you how to slow and reduce the impact of the risk.

Whichever government is in power at the time can do a lot to offset the damaging social effects, or to deflate prices without killing the whole market. 


Keeping the market fluid is crucial. The worst hardships and social damage happen when homeowners can't downsize because the value of their properties is falling faster then they can pay off their mortgages.


Government initiatives like subsidising genuinely affordable housing, and having enough low cost homes available, would give people with mortgages in negative equity places to move to. 

Government can prioritise infrastructure works in outlying regions to develop work opportunities out of major cities, and provide incentives for business to do the same (and additional fees/taxes for those who don't). 

They can establish tenant friendly laws to make renting more viable for long term city life. Etc,etc.


There's a huge set of tools to hand for a government with vision and purpose to ease what could be a crisis into a soft(er) landing. If they fail to use those tools, the people of Australia should punish them for their negligence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, but that's missing the point.

Trumble's desperately focusing in on government debt at a time when everyone else is sounding increasing strident alarms about household debt.


The [OECD] warning puts renewed onus on the federal government to prepare for a potential shakeout caused by a house price crash.

The OECD notes that households now account for around half of Australia's total debt, which has soared well above 250 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with around a third of the total in 1995.

At the same time, the surge in property borrowing has pushed Australia towards the top of the OECD rankings for household debt and to around one-third more than the group's average. Furthermore, the rankings are based on figures dating back to 2015, thus missing the dramatic surge in debt-to-GDP of the past year or so.

Clean Energy Finance Corporation chief Oliver Yates told a Senate estimates hearing that the agency received an email on Friday from an unidentified company requesting a loan for a proposed $1.2 billion, 900 megawatt coal plant with carbon capture and storage.

<TEXT>  its just going to take a long time for a lot of people to die first.

Typically, revolutions happen to accelerate this process. Class wars are the situations that generally lead to revolutions, and the rapidly escalating wealth imbalance suggests we're in the process of losing one right now.


In Australia in the past we've had what have effectively been non-violent revolutions driven by citizen action and civil disobedience. Those mechanisms worked because governments of the time were not prepared for them, and did not have the surveillance and legal apparatus to detect and defuse them.

Times have changed, and surveillance of communications is close to absolute. Metadata collection means aggregate data can be used to identify community hotspots and shut them down. Regulatory capture and media control means messages of protest will be minimised and distorted before it can change the minds of the undecided population.Historically powerful things like general strikes, mas protests, occupations etc are illegal in any effective form, and to the extent they are permitted, already have control plans established against them.

What the authorities miss here is that those opportunities for peaceful change were safety valves for the discontented. Successive governments over the years have wired down the safeties.

For now, in the absence of an economic collapse, or other trigger, the pressure remains low. If there's a badly managed economic shock that leaves enough Australians in poverty or distressed, that will change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's interesting to see the sudden surge of spam posts now that the scale of their involvement in Reddit has been exposed. 

Astroturf advertising here is incredibly cheap per eyeball, but all of the revelations will either reduce their effectiveness or force Reddit to take action against them.

In December last year, I managed to place two entirely fake news stories onto influential subreddits - with millions of subscribers - and vote them to the top with fake accounts and fake upvotes for less than $200. It was simple, cheap and effective. 

https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/5vxxyh/reddit_is_being_regularly_manipulated_by_large/

The spammers know that, and are flooding as many adverts into the subreddits as tthey can before the hammer falls. It'll be interesting to see what emerges after the battle is done - attempting to monetorise inline advertising was what killed Slashdot and Digg. 

It may be a good time to start a new social media platform with built-in bayesian/machine learning protection...

Any good R coders reading?...

<TEXT> The Cormack Foundation was set up to rely on investments to fund political donations in perpetuity. They currently fund both state and federal Liberal organisations, and are biggest annual donor to the Liberal party, but their **purpose** is to fund the administration and expenses of **whichever party** best enacts the goals of their administrators. Their administrators are largely drawn from mining, fossil fuel, mainstream media, banking, telecommunications and grocery corporations. 

They have existential control over the Liberal party's finances.

Last year, they funded the Liberal Democrats and Family First, likely as a warning shot to Turnbull, who had to top up the shortfall with his own money.

They also have direct access to LNP politicians at events like the Australian Davos Connection, and it's possible that there are incentives offered to individual politicians in private.

<TEXT> You've caught me out there. 

I didn't keep the links, and I'm not going to chase them up on a Friday evening...

Having said that, I remember Wang used the wind fatality data from the Caithness anti-windfarm group, which included:

Of the 170 fatalities:

103 were wind industry and direct support workers (divers, construction, maintenance, engineers, etc), or small turbine owner /operators.

69 were public fatalities, including workers not directly dependent on the wind industry (e.g.  transport workers).

17 bus passengers were killed in one single incident in Brazil in March 2012

4 members of the public were killed in an aircraft crash in May 2014 and a further three members of the public killed in a transport accident in September 2014.


The nuclear fatality data only included radiation-specific fatalities and excluded mining, construction, transport etc of nuclear fuel.

There was a study done by the Canadian nuclear regulator a year or two earlier showing that whole of lifecycle fatalities per unit of energy output was a little less than double that of gas.

Having said that, I'm not aware of ANY wind fatalities in Australia. Do you know of any, or have access to the statistics? 

I do know that there are uranium mining fatalities here every few years, and epidemiology suggesting elevated lung cancer in uranium miners.

Anyway, that should give you enough to Google around and draw your own conclusions. Just be careful with Reddit/Subreddits. There's a strong pattern of pro-nuclear deception here.

The SPD wants to limit the tax deduction at 500,000 annually for members of a listed corporation's management board.

Board members in large corporations can earn much more in salary and benefits, but payments above that level - which are currently tax-exempt business expenses - would cost the company more in tax because it could not write them off.

<TEXT> I know the article, it's trotted out by nuclear power astroturfers at every opportunity. 

Problem is, it was based on Brian Wang's analysis in 2011, and is long obsolete given how much new wind and solar has been installed.

Even when it was written, some of the early criticisms were that it didn't account for lifecycle statistics, which meant that construction fatalities in new renewable industries weighted more heavily than those in nuclear generation, which has been running far longer, as well as unrelated accidents, such as road deaths, that were counted against renewable industries. Likewise fatalities incurred in very small scale remote area, marine, and industrial installs that aren't part of mainstream electricity production were counted against renewables.

TLDR: It's and old and busted news story. </TEXT>

They show clearly that AEMO kept revising both their temperature and wind predictions to be more optimistic, despite evidence to the contrary. 

They also show that a 120MW Torrens Island gas generator failed due to a boiler leak, with 60MW more of Torrens Island generation lost because the gas generators couldn't cope with the heat. Lincoln 1 and Lincoln 3 gas generators had electronics fail causing the loss of 73MW of power. We already know the government decided not to start Pelican Point.


Meanwhile, wind generation gradually dropped 100MW below AEMO's poorly chosen expectations.

<TEXT> Not exactly.

The Cormack Foundation is normally the biggest annual donor to the Liberal party, and was set up to rely on investments to fund the Coalition. They fund both state and federal Liberal organisations

The foundation's main income comes from:

* The banks, about $2.2 million/yr

* Mining companies, about $750,000/yr

* Grocery chains, notably frequent /r/Australia spammers Westfarmers, about $600,000

* Telstra, about $200,000

* A few investment firms to round off the rest of it.

The purpose of the foundation is essentially to fund the administration and expenses of the Liberal party, or whichever party best represents the views of the foundation's administrators, in perpetuity. 

This is important to note in light of the Cormack administrators decision to fund the Liberal Democrats and Family First last year, and Turnbull's need to chuck in his own $1.75 million. I'd see the funding shortfall and donations to other parties as a warning shot to the LNP moderates, and a reminder who butters their bread.

As to who the Cormack foundation actually are, key figures are their director Hugh Morgan, who's been influencing the Libs environment policy since the late '80s, Murdoch's brother-in-law John Calvert-Jones, banker Charles Goode, and coal miner Viv Forbes. 

While the foundation has existential control over the Liberal party's funding, it's likely the indirect influence over elected officials goes even deeper. The main players get together at events like the Australian Davos Connection meetings held at a private resort on Hayman Island. Given the current government's single-minded anti-renewable focus, it's likely that the incentives offered to individual politicians in private far exceeds the Cormack contributions.

<TEXT> In the five years 2010-2015, the price of solar PV dropped by 80 per cent, and the price of batteries has fallen on average by 14 per cent every year between 2007 and 2014.

Typical household electricity consumption in Australia is 15-25 units/day, at an average cost of 39c/unit, or between $2000 and $3600 per year.

Currently, a solar system that'll make and store enough electricity to meet that demand is around $20-30k, so around 10 years to pay off the investment.

If both PV and batteries continue their current trends, the threshold where self-generation and the opportunity to go off grid become financially sensible will happen in three or four years.

At that stage, those new "clean" coal power stations will become redundant junk. </TEXT>

In essence, laws in Germany and much of the EU are drafted as a business agreement, and require the landlord to provide and maintain their product to an national standard.

Tenants have the rights to treat the house as their home - paint the walls, do modifications etc. They're only required to return the house to "base build" when they leave.

<TEXT> It may be the bubble burst we have to have, but it doesn't need to have as much impact as it will if left to burst on its own.

It doesn't need to be doom and gloom.

Whichever government is in power at the time can do a lot to offset the damaging effects, or to deflate prices without killing the whole market. Keeping the market fluid is crucial. The worst hardships and social damage happen when homeowners can't downsize because the value of their properties is falling faster then they can pay off their mortgages. 

Things like subsidising genuinely affordable housing and having it available so people with mortgages in negative equity have places to move to. Government can prioritise infrastructure works in outlying regions to develop work opportunities out of major cities, and provide incentives for business to do the same (and additional fees/taxes for those who don't). They can establish rent controls to make tenancy more viable for long term city life. Etc,etc.

There's a huge set of tools to hand for a government with vision and purpose. If Shorten and his team can make use of them, and communicate their vision, they'll could eclipse Keating's moment.


I hope for Australia's sake they do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> India, sure... there's a shitshow.

You'd think so, but even there, business has worked out it's cheaper to switch to renewables.

The Indian government has forecast that it will exceed the renewable energy targets set in Paris last year by nearly half and three years ahead of schedule.

A draft 10-year energy blueprint published this week predicts that 57% of Indias total electricity capacity will come from non-fossil fuel sources by 2027. The Paris climate accord target was 40% by 2030.

The forecast reflects an increase in private sector investment in Indian renewable energy projects over the past year, according to analysts.

<TEXT> At least all the fuss about the robo-debts has stopped people discussing the LNP's attempts to cut social security that's already so low the Business Council believes it "presents a barrier to employment and risks entrenching poverty." 

The OECD agrees, saying Australia's unemployment benefit has reached the point where it may no longer be effective in "enabling someone to look for a suitable job".

Even the Libs own senate enquiry said there is a compelling case for boosting Newstart.

Despite all that, on Monday Morrison, Porter and Birmingham insisted unemployment benefits need to be cut further.

What is wrong with these people?

While rare in Australia, it's been used elsewhere to consolidate systems that are being run for public benefit, and where coordination of assets is needed for efficiency. Railways are a common example.

As a general rule, nationalising to provide infrastructure works well, while nationalising of failing businesses is risky.

Typical household electricity consumption in Australia is 15-25 units/day, at an average cost of 39c/unit, or between $2000 and $3600 per year.

Currently, a solar system that'll make and store enough electricity to meet that demand is around $20-30k, so around 10 years to pay off the investment.

That's borderline, so most people won't get enough benefit to stump up the cash, but if the utilities start charging more for electricity, or the price of the gear falls, Australians will be buying shiploads of them.

Every 5c increase in the price of electricity, or 10% fall in the price of the system will knock a year off the payback time.  I reckon 6 years is the sweet spot - at that stage, utilities will be crossing themselves and saying goodbye. </TEXT>

The state has high and rising levels of un or underemployment, and rapidly falling house prices that are leaving home owners in negative equity and unable to sell. Many will end up having no choice to default on the loans as the value of their properties won't pay off enough of the principle to keep them afloat.


It's a nasty trap, and it's only getting worse.

One of the early criticisms was that it didn't account for lifecycle statistics, which meant that construction fatalities in new renewable industries weighted more heavily than those in nuclear generation, which has been running far longer.

There are also other aspects have also been debunked many times. An example given was that the deaths due to wind generation statistic included 32 people in Brazil who died in a bus accident on the way to work.


The solar figures included some fatalities incurred in very small scale remote area, marine, and industrial installs that aren't part of mainstream electricity production.

Within four years, they also worked an average of 25 hours more per month, which works out as 17% more hours than the participants who didnt receive it. That suggests incentives to work are not reduced by introducing UBI and that national productivity would improve.

<TEXT> It's about a lot more corrupt behaviour than a few "gifts".

The transcripts of Netanyahu's taped negotiations with his supposed arch-nemesis, media mogul Arnon Mozes of the Yediot Ahronot newspaper group, have dominated the national agenda in recent weeks. Netanyahu allegedly promised to promote legislation that would weaken Yediot's main competitor in exchange for more favorable coverage.

It follows previous allegations that Netanyahu improperly accepted lavish gifts from wealthy supporters  including Australian billionaire James Packer and Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan  and that his personal attorney, who is also a cousin, represented a German firm involved in a controversial $1.5 billion sale of submarines to Israel.

These follow previous repeated claims that his wife Sara misused state funds for personal use, compounding a public image of Israel's first family as detached hedonists corrupted by years in power.

<TEXT> They mostly summarise and explain it there, but the summary misses a few interesting aspects. I've blocked it out below and bolded the key guts of the idea.

1. all of the chemical components of the atmosphere, mostly nitrogen and oxygen, but also carbon dioxide, water vapour and methane etc absorb or reflect different frequencies of light depending on their shape and size.

2. Light in some frequencies are strongly absorbed (and sent back down) by come of those components, notably carbon dioxide and methane, which is why they're called greenhouse gases. The frequency that's absorbed covers most of the infrared range of light spectrum 

3. There's a narrow range of frequencies that aren't absorbed by anything, so light at that frequency just goes straight through. **That range is between 8 and 14 m, and is called the infrared atmospheric window.**

4. Everything emits infrared when it's heated, and most materials emit a wide range of infrared energy, depending on how big it is and what it's made of.

5. These guys realised that **glass beads emit infrared based on their size, so they made glass beads between 8 and 14 m,** which absorb energy from both outside and inside, then emit it in those frequencies.

6. They then put a reflector under the beads so most of the IR would go in one direction - up.

7. ???


8. Profit.

<TEXT> Not just privatisation. AEMO is at the root of most of these failures, and should be investigated by an independent (eg, not LNP controlled) entity.

They're consistently favouring higher cost fossil fuel plants over renewables, and making operational decisions that cause failures in regions with with high renewable components. Given the frequency and impact of these decisions, it's increasingly unlikely they're not commercially or ideologically motivated.

This whole country is in desperate need of a wide ranging anti-corruption body. Institutionalised theft is just so deeply endemic and growing so fast it'll take a massive effort to stop it already, let alone if it becomes more entrenched.

<TEXT> The LNP is hilariously corrupt over coal.

Trumble's been shirtfronting Shorten in parliament over it, and even Morrison got into the act, though that one backfired.


With the government upbeat after a Mr Turnbull's aggressive pivot, and buoyed by the South Australian black-out, Treasurer Scott Morrison produced a lump of black coal in Parliament to taunt the opposition over energy.

"This is coal. Don't be afraid," he said waving it about in contravention of the standing orders.

"There's no word for coal-a-phobia officially but it's the malady that's afflicting those opposite."

Ministers then handed the hamburger-sized piece along the frontbench although it stopped abruptly when the pregnant Assistant Treasurer, Kelly O'Dwyer, refused to handle it.

<TEXT> WA is already experiencing big drops in property prices. 

This is true, and it's accelerating rather than leveling off. In my suburb, median house prices fell by 17% in the past year, and 9% in the last quarter.

There will be a substantial number of people who bought in the past three years who'll be on zero or negative equity by now. The consequence on the market is already visible - without equity to trade on, these people are essentially trapped. They won't be upgrading as their families grow, which will drag the market down even further.

<TEXT> From 2003:

Last weeks conviction and jailing in Australia of two leaders of a rightwing populist party on trumped-up charges of fraud has set a dangerous precedent for use against any political movement considered a threat to the parliamentary order. After a protracted political and legal witchhunt, secretly orchestrated at the highest levels of the Australian government, the criminal law has been manipulated to trample over basic democratic rights and imprison the founders of an opposition party.

Former MP Pauline Hanson and a co-founder of her One Nation Party, David Ettridge, were each sentenced to three years jail without parole under the Queensland Criminal Code. As a result, both are barred for life from standing for parliament. Their alleged crime arose from registering Pauline Hansons One Nation as a party under that states electoral laws in December 1997. They were accused of supplying the names and addresses of 500 members whom a court later ruled to be merely supporters.

By comparison, assault of elderly, blind, disabled, pregnant, or mentally retarded person 2nd degree with a firearm carries a mandatory 2.5 year sentence in NSW. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not really a find, but several years ago, some Kiwi friends of mine in Australia invited me to a hangi in the bush behind their house. They had a steel bedframe to load the food onto, and a few lengths or railway track to heat up and put in with the rocks.

We started digging it at about 9am, and coincidentally, someone opened the first beer about the same time. The ground was really hard, so we got the food in late.

We all kept drinking all day, then sometime after the sun went down, decided it was time to dig up the hangi. We all wandered into the scrub, platters and shovels in hand, but couldn't find the food. Some claimed they could smell it nearby, but we never found it. We ended up dining on microwave pizza and sausages.

TLDR:

If you go metal detecting in the Australian bush and find some railway track on an old bed, that's probably my dinner. </TEXT>

It's worth noting that AMOLEDs scale resolution/power better than normal LEDs, which need a more powerful backlight as pixel density rises, and they tend to get about 30% more efficient every generation.

<TEXT> Yeah. 

Laws aren't made for normal people. We know how to behave, not to steal, not to hurt other people, all the usual stuff. 

Laws are made to hem in people who want to stretch the boundaries of what the rest of us recognise as right and wrong. They're drafted to be do that job, and to be clear to everyone what's intended, but they're as porous as a net to someone skilled in reading and writing them.

Globally, there's been a trend towards politicians and governments crossing those boundaries while remaining within the letter of the laws. We, the people, recognise that what's happening is wrong, but they point at the law and say "we're entitled".

Trump is taking that trend one step further. He's giving direct instructions to the military. He's issuing laws without consulting the State department. He's ignoring the conventions and controls that are intended to rein in his office, and he's getting away with it. In a year, Americans will be bowing at his altar. https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-24/pdf/2017-01798.pdf



The rule of law is basically a consensus - we all follow it because it makes for a more level playing field, and life's better for most of us if we do. 

When someone in power decides they'll just do what they want, there's no more level, we're of very shaky ground. </TEXT>

The mining companies have been running a massive ad campaign against them because of their tax plan. Its catchphrase is that the taxes raised will go to NSW and Victoria, while the jobs will be lost in WA.

It's a brutal attack on Brendon Grylls and the Nats here, far in excess of any of the other political parties' efforts.

Turnbull says his donations to the Libs have been "regular and generous".


Asked at his first major speech whether he would reveal the donation before the next disclosure, the prime minister said: My donations to the Liberal party have been regular and generous and I would encourage others to do the same.


But there's nothing in the AEC records of donations from him any year in the past decade.

The requirements are:

Donors must disclose donations totalling more than the disclosure threshold made to a registered political party. From 200607, third parties (including associated entities) who incur political expenditure in excess of the disclosure threshold are also required to lodge an annual return.

<TEXT> The modelling can suggest whatever it wants to. Reality disagrees.


A study of US corporate tax rates from 1948 to 2010 found that:

The top statutory corporate tax rate has been falling since the early 1950s. The top corporate tax rate was 52 percent throughout the Eisenhower administration17 percentage points higher than the current top rate of 35 percent. U.S. GDP grew by almost 4 percent annually in the 1950s compared with a 1.8 percent growth rate in the 2000s. 

On the surface, it would appear that more robust economic growth is associated with higher corporate tax rates. Further analysis, however, finds no evidence that either the statutory top corporate tax rate or the effective marginal tax rate on capital income is correlated with real GDP growth.

http://www.epi.org/publication/ib364-corporate-tax-rates-and-economic-growth/

Likewise, it won't attract more investment:

New research ridicules the Prime Minister's claim that cutting the company tax rate will boost foreign investment, pointing out that almost all of Australia's foreign investment applications already come from countries with much lower tax rates.

The analysis by the Australia Institute finds that 97 per cent of the applications to Australia's foreign investment review board come from countries with lower company tax rates. By value, 71 per cent of applications come from countries with lower rates.


The Coalition's tax cuts for business will return very little to the Australian economy for the cost to the budget. "All of this raises the question  if Australia is already successful at attracting foreign investment why would we give tax cuts to foreigners?" said the report's author David Richardson, a senior research fellow at the self-described progressive think tank.

<TEXT> The biggest LNP donor was Paul Marks.

Mr Marks is a controversial figure, closely linked to Turnbull government MP Stuart Robert. Mr Robert was sacked from Mr Turnbull's frontbench last year after being accused of using his ministerial office to open doors for Mr Marks and his companies in China.

It seems Mr Marks made a good investment. Thanks to Robert's corrupt actions, he'll have "earned" well over the $1.3 million he gave to the LNP.

Looks like cabinet positions are relatively cheap as well.

Cabinet ministers also contributed to the flagging Liberal campaign, including Immigration Minister Peter Dutton with $50,000 and Education Minister Simon Birmingham with $20,000. Finance Minister Mathias Cormann gave $29,000 through his fundraising vehicle.

<TEXT> Treasury is politicised, and highly unreliable, but even their models show after-tax wage growth in the long run (10 years) of less than 0.3 per cent. In the mean time, other taxes would be needed to replace the lower corporate tax rate. In other words, the best outcome for workers is that for the next decade they give their money to the gov't to give to corporations in the hope nobody'll change the rules in the mean time and take that minute pay rise back off them.

Meanwhile, channeling the same amount of money into education and training would generate an order of magnitude more growth sooner.

And that's putting the best case for corp tax cuts forward. Verifiable reality suggests that's wildly optimistic.

The reduction in top tax rates appears to be uncorrelated with saving, investment, and productivity growth. The top tax rates appear to have little or no relation to the size of the economic pie. However the top tax rate reductions appear to be associated with the increasing concentration of income at the top of the income distribution. The report notes that tax rates were at the highest when growth was at its peak, and that the reduction in tax rates has not had any discernible impact on the types of investment that lead to growth.

Conclusion of a study of tax rates since 1945 by the US Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan entity associated with the Library of Congress that does academic quality research to answer difficult policy questions.

<TEXT> Turnbull has never really had any principles. He'll express opinions, but those ere even less binding than Howard's "non-core promises". 

After all, in 2012, Turnbull said that American politics were profoundly dysfunctional, and in reference to the staggering budget deficit and public debt said that whats depressing about the debate in America is that so much of it is actually just innumerate. In particular, Turnbull was scathing about the Republican idea that the budgetary situation could be improved by cutting the taxes of the wealthy, calling it  just bizarre. In 2017, that idea is the centrepiece of his budgetary policy.

It's not so much that he's indecisive, just that his goal, as always, was to win, for himself, for his prestige, for his posterity. Once he won, and propped the trophy on his shelf, he promptly lost interest.

What we see from him now is not so much indecision as disinterest. He just doesn't care.

Morrison wants to reduce taxes for business. "Sure Scotty, whatever". Tudge wants to install a remorseless robo-biller in Centrelink. "No worries Al, I'll back you on that". Dutton wants to add the acronym for "Service Specialist" to the collars of Border Force uniforms. "Fine Tater, do what you want".

 Free trade deal with US has hurt Australia: ANU

The US last year clocked up an $US11 billion ($A14.6 billion) trade surplus with us thanks to the US Australian Free Trade deal we signed 12 years ago that also was a stinker.

As the Australian National University's (ANU) Thomas Faunce reported, that deal was a major contributor to the 80 per cent blowout in the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits System, which has put enormous strain on the federal budget.

According to the ANU's Crawford School, that pact has hurt Australia every year since it was signed, with $57 billion in lost and diverted trade in 2012 alone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Adolph Hitler 1922:

"If I am ever really in power, the destruction of the Jews will be my first and most important job. As soon as I have power, I shall have gallows after gallows erected, for example, in Munich on the Marienplatz-as many of them as traffic allows. Then the Jews will be hanged one after another, and they will stay hanging until they stink. They will stay hanging as long as hygienically possible. As soon as they are untied, then the next group will follow and that will continue until the last Jew in Munich is exterminated. Exactly the same procedure will be followed in other cities until Germany is cleansed of the last Jew!"

Hitler 1939

Europe cannot find peace until the Jewish question has been solved. One thing I should like to say on this day [the sixth anniversary of his being appointed Chancellor of the Reich] which may be memorable for others as well as for us Germans. In the course of my life I have very often been a prophet and have usually been ridiculed for it.  Today I will once more be a prophet: if the international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshivization of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe."

For decades his message was the same. The end result was entirely predictable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree. 

From 1933, Germany was enacting legislation to marginalise Jews. In 1935, the Nuremberg laws removed protection and restricted economic participation. The Kristallnacht pogrom was in 1938, as was the legislation enforcing different identity cards, names, and passports for Jews.

Even earlier, since the 1920s, Hitler had been talking and writing about exterminating Jews. in Mein Kampf, he wrote that the: sacrifice of millions at the front would have been prevented if twelve or fifteen thousand of these Hebrew corrupters of the people had been held under poison gas.


His, and Germany's, intent was clear and predictable, even before 1939. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, agree with all that. We're taking in 10% less taxes as a proportion of GDP than OECD average, and our tax base has been falling steeply since 2008.

We also have one of the highest ratios of tax levied at federal level in the OECD. Most places have a wider distribution (state, local, etc) of income sources.

The combination of those two things, shrinking income, and an over-concentration of spending power at federal level, is making reform impossible, even in regions that aren't ideologically limited. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's probably a good time to bring up the subject of reform. If crossbenchers or the ALP raise the subject, they'd get a lot of support from the grassroots industry.

There's been enough collusion between the MBA and the LNP that even the builders themselves have had enough.


A senior executive of a major construction company has strongly criticised the Master Builders Association and the Fair Work Building Commission, accusing them of running a political propaganda campaign to portray the industry as corrupt.

Lou Raunik, a director of national building company, Icon Co, wrote a letter to fellow construction industry representatives saying he would not renew his membership of the Master Builders Association this year because it had failed to serve the interests of its members.

"It now places a higher priority and greater emphasis on maintaining a close relationship with the Liberal Party by feeding the narrative of the political agenda of the day rather than understanding the real issues we as members and industry participants face on a daily basis, and advocating on our behalf," he said.

<TEXT> So we have data showing that lowering corporate tax had:

* No effect on wage growth.

* Increased unemployment.

* No effect on GDP.

* Increased public debt.


That makes it very clear that while capital is highly mobile, so are the profits that capitalists take from a nation's people. The only result of lower corporate taxes is increasing public debt, and eventually, reduced services and security.

No thanks.

In 2010, unemployment was almost triple 2008 figures, and by the start of 2017 has gradually drifted down to roughly double unemployment (compared to 2008). 

Wage growth was completely linear for that entire period.


It doesn't seem like anything's trickled through those fat fingers yet. How long do Swedish workers have to wait?

<TEXT> Do you know who has low corporate taxes? The Nordic countries.



Australia raises 4.3 percent of GDP from corporate income tax, Denmark raises slightly less at 3 percent and Sweden raises a little less again at 2.6 percent of GDP. Norway is the exception with corporate revenue equal to 8.5 percent of GDP. 

Like Australia, Norway is situated on large reserves of natural resources (eg, oil   gas) but unlike Australia, charges companies a corporate income tax rate of 66 percent to extract the oil.

I agree that Australia should follow Norway's model. </TEXT>

 Unintended damage to the negative electrode windings consistently in the corner of the cell closest to the negative tab.

Poor welding causes tall welding defects. Normal swelling forces those welds into the negative electrode. During high states of charge, the heating of the cell causes thermal runaway.

They are saying that the battery system, and its electronic safety measures to address issues like short circuits, met or exceeded industry standards, and that **Samsung's electronics did not contribute to the failure of either Company A or Company B's battery cells.**

<TEXT> Greens policy was strongly anti-metadata retention, and there was an opportunity to support them by voting in July 2016. That didn't happen. 

Scott Ludlam in March 2015:

"The act that we are amending today was written in 1979, under the prime ministership of the recently passed Malcolm Fraser," he observed.

"Mobile phones only existed in Star Trek. The internet was unthinkable for all but a handful of researchers and futurists. Fast-forward to 2015: there are more mobile phones than people in this country and the internet is busily infusing nearly every corner of our lives.

"Every one of these devices, seen and unseen, generates a cloud of information in the course of its ordinary operation. One single tweet 140 characters long is the tip of a small iceberg of code that runs to about a page and a half,"

"Your phone handset is essentially a tracking device that allows you to make phone calls. Our relationships and our social lives are increasingly mediated by digital tools. 

"Collectively, these devices and apps silently generate billions of records of place, time, contact, data type and volume, all of it aggregated under this loose concept of 'metadata'. Anyone who tells you that these are simple billing records or the innocent envelopes surrounding substantive communications is either technically illiterate or lying to your face," Ludlam said.

And there are some numbers that are truly scary.

"In 2012-2013, agencies made around 340,000 demands for this information from Telstra, Optus and the rest of the telecommunications industry, without the trouble of having to apply for a single warrant," 

"Now, I do not have more recent numbers than that because the Attorney-General's Department is refusing to publish the report for the last financial year. Telecommunications regulator the ACMA reports 748,000 warrantless authorisations were received by carriers in 2013-14."

<TEXT> Interesting. A year ago, bought a Skoda Rapid TSI that (really) needs 95 octane fuel. I've noticed that if I put 95 in from some petrol stations, it'll occasionally have brief engine issues, stall on idle and go into limp mode for a few seconds. Topping up with 98 solves the problem.

Using 95 from my local independent doesn't trigger the stalls, and I've learned to be careful where I buy.


I wonder if it's possible for petrol stations to "accidentally" adulterate 95 with 91? </TEXT>

Consumers pay for power privatisation

Electricity privatisation has failed to deliver cheaper power to consumers and has not improved the sector's efficiency, a new analysis by The Australia Institute has found.

The analysis shows that since Victoria privatised power in the 1990s, electricity prices have outpaced inflation, increasing by 170 per cent compared with an increase of 60 per cent in the consumer price index.

The malware is a Perl script that unpacks and runs a Mach-O binary and an Apple-specific Java class file. On Linux the Perl script might run, but would do nothing.


This is the extent of the "Linux compatibility".

it has code to do this both using the Mac screencapture command and the Linux xwd command. It also has code to get the systems uptime, using the Mac uptime command or the Linux cat /proc/uptime command.


Note that neither of those commands are specific to Linux, and both would work on OSX... </TEXT>

Open source code known as libjpeg, which the malware uses to open or create JPG-formatted image files, was last updated in 1998.

Maybe on the Mac, but Linux uses libjpeg-turbo, which has had a number of security updates, including some in the past 12 months (Last Update: 2016-11-03). libjpeg hasn't been updated because it's long obsolete.

Reed said Malwarebytes has yet to spot a Linux variant, but he said he wouldn't be surprised if one existed.

<TEXT> I once made the mistake of bringing my kelpie (Australian sheep dog) when I went to collect some emu eggs. I parked the ute, checked that the daddy emu wasn't there, and got into the nest to grab the eggs.


I didn't notice the dog had vanished until I heard the very loud drumming sound of a very close, very angry male emu. The bloody dog had got bored, found the emu, rounded it up and herded it back to me.

I dropped the bag, and covered the distance back to the car faster than Usain Bolt would have, hearing the thudding of the big bird's feet behind me. I jumped up into the back of the ute, then had to race the emu from side to side trying to open the door before it ran around the car.

Meanwhile, the dog had flopped down under a shrub, and was watching the entertainment with a big grin and occasional encouraging bark, presumably for the emu.

TLDR: don't bring a hyperactive herding dog to a sneaky egg theft. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To justify the NBN raids, the AFP used section 70(1), an obsolete, overly broad law that makes it a crime for a "Commonwealth officer" to publish or communicate to anyone else any fact or document which they know or possess "by virtue of being a Commonwealth officer".

The AFP has intentionally restricted powers. It can only investigate crimes under Commonwealth laws, and there aren't that many of those. To evade those restrictions, they are using section 70(1) so they can investigate activities that should be outside their jurisdiction. 

An example is this one:

The AFP has been conducting an investigation of Dr Peter Young, the former medical director of mental health services for our offshore immigration detention centres, after he commented publicly and critically about the medical care of asylum seekers and particularly the horrible and completely avoidable death of Hamid Khazaei.


These are the actions of a politicised entity dutifully searching for a legal loophole that would allow them to fulfill a request from their political masters, not the actions of an independent organisation.

One of the more common (and absolutely correct) benefits of the state based ICACs so far is their ability to compel people to testify in open session. This allows for transparency and oversight, and reduces the opportunity to erode the commission's independence.  </TEXT>

Same as Trump, he's a rich man after a trophy.

Both were elected as successful businessmen. Trumpeted as agents of change, someone different.


Trump will be about as effective in government as Turnbull has been. It was all a bait   switch.

Politics has become a rich man's sport, and the winner gets to put the head of the country on their wall for their friends to admire. They don't care what happens to the rest of the carcass.

Popular support is the first element which is necessary for the creation of authority. But an authority resting on that foundation alone is still quite frail, uncertain and vacillating. Hence everyone who finds himself vested with an authority that is based only on popular support must take measures to improve and consolidate the foundations of that authority by the creation of force.

The LNP is working to ensure continuity and stability of government. That means they will need to have enough information about __all__ citizens to be able to identify and control those who may decide to dissent.

At this stage, it will not be necessary to have administrative groups such as a Division of Garbage Analysis, but disturbing results from metadata analysis may guide them in that direction. </TEXT>

Lowering the corporate income-tax rate would not spur economic growth. The analysis finds no evidence that high corporate tax rates have a negative impact on economic growth (i.e., it finds no evidence that changes in either the statutory corporate tax rate or the effective marginal tax rate on capital income are correlated with economic growth).

<TEXT> But you have to admit, from a LNP perspective, he has a point. Australia has the ability to do this far better than the Philippines.

We now have metadata collection and retention on all devices Australians use. Police surveillance drones and fixed cameras can already invisibly watch people in real time. We have face recognition and number plate tracking already. There's a good chance untraceable cash transactions will be made illegal soon, and we already have detention centres that are underutilised.

We're at the point where it will be possible to easily identify anyone who has searched for hydroponics, bought suspicious items online, talked to the wrong people on the street, burnt the flag, done anything suspicious at all, in fact.
 
We could do this, cart anyone who's not been a good citizen off to a detention centre and apply strong, swift justice, or if there's no doubt about their guilt, save money by summarily executing them. Recidivism rates are over 60%, so why not? 

Australia could very quickly be drug and criminal free, a utopia.

<TEXT> No it isn't.

As someone who would normally consider "appeal to authority" as a logical fallacy to be avoided, but who also works in risk management, I can say some of the examples given go well past "near miss reporting"


At BPs oil refinery at Cherry Point, in Washington state, US, the report said there is no single aggregated list of safety critical equipment and there have been instances where getting replacement equipment up and running was compromised due to incomplete data. Response time to failure is compromised by the various sources of data. This is seen as a significant concern during a response crisis. Five years earlier the plant had been penalised for 13 serious safety violations, including failure to keep records.

This is how people die, because a company takes such a huge PR hit from adhering to safety reporting standards.

No. People die when companies fail to learn from previous accidents, and authorities fail to follow up when companies don't correct critical errors more than 5 years after they've been raised. </TEXT>

This study examines how conversing with passengers in a vehicle differs from conversing on a cell phone while driving. We compared how well drivers were able to deal with the demands of driving when conversing on a cell phone, conversing with a passenger, and when driving without any distraction. In the conversation conditions, participants were instructed to converse with a friend about past experiences in which their life was threatened. The results show that the number of driving errors was highest in the cell phone condition; in passenger conversations more references were made to traffic, and the production rate of the driver and the complexity of speech of both interlocutors dropped in response to an increase in the demand of the traffic. The results indicate that passenger conversations differ from cell phone conversations because the surrounding traffic not only becomes a topic of the conversation, helping driver and passenger to share situation awareness, but the driving condition also has a direct influence on the complexity of the conversation, thereby mitigating the potential negative effects of a conversation on driving.

TLDR: It's safer talking to passengers. Passengers can also see traffic conditions and alert the driver.

<TEXT> For the lifeless drones in the LNP, it beats acting on evidence that could actually reduce costs. 

But imagine if they did something that would save far more than the cost of the unemployment benefits?

Early intervention is key to reducing the costly impact of poor mental health in Australia, says a visiting UK economist.

Mental illness has been put on the economic agenda, as its cost to the nation soars to more than $60 billion a year.

The National Mental Health Commission estimates the cost of mental ill-health to Australia is around four per cent of GDP or about $4000 for every tax payer.

Rather than waiting for a person's poor mental health to reach crisis point, the focus needs to be on prevention and early intervention, says Professor Martin Knapp from the London School of Economics.

**Government killed emissions scheme despite knowing it could shave $15 billion off electricity bills**

The Turnbull government is sitting on advice that an emissions intensity scheme - the carbon policy it put on the table only to rule out just 36 hours later - would save households and businesses across the country up to $15 billion in electricity bills over a decade.

While Malcolm Turnbull has publicly rejected this sort of scheme by claiming it would push up prices, an Australian Electricity Market Commission report handed to the government months ago finds it would actually cost consumers far less than other approaches, including doing nothing.

<TEXT> Yeah, you're not the only one who thinks that way, so that's how we end up with barbarism.

National and global social values aren't visible or solid or even easily definable, they're a fluid set of things that are accepted as a priori fact, or at least as important by most of the people participating in those societies.

There have been times and places in the history of humanity when women were seen as spoils of war, where killing all of your enemy's children was a sensible way of ensuring your supremacy, where putting captured soldiers in the belly of a bronze bull and lighting a fire under them was good sport.

Our society, at least the part of it I live in, gradually transitioned to a path where we accepted that other people think, act, and are more similar to us than they are different. Between us, we made agreements, laws, and contracts that limited how much we hurt each other, even when we disagreed. There was a trend towards reducing the severity and scope of conflicts where possible. Visionaries started to think about how we could create better lives, instead of how we could be better warriors.

Even many military people believed that doing so allowed for a path to peace after the fighting was over. It was seen as better than the centuries of anger and resentment to neighbours that happened after unlimited (except by technology) wars were over.

Now, we're losing touch with the reasons those agreements were important. Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo torture, rendition flights and drone assassinations that kill 30 civilians, all ratchet up the barbarism. 


You justify it by saying "All's fair", those 30 people who've never raised a hand against us were worth killing because we assassinated the leader. Meanwhile, someone in Daesh, who thinks very much like you, is saying they're justified cutting the heads off a different 30 non-combatants because it suits **their** political goals.


Both of you are making barbarism a self-fulfilling prophecy, because  neither of you value the society we **could** become. You only value the impact you can have on your opponents now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, you're right, and in fact it actually says so in the PISA report.


If you compare Australian students in the top and bottom quarter by their parents' socio economic background, the bottom 25 per cent are on average three years of schooling behind the top 25 per cent. 

That's in all three tested areas in PISA: scientific, mathematical and reading literacy. And it means that a kid born poor, by no fault of their own, is on average getting a far crappier education than a kid born rich. The achievement gap is almost as bad for indigenous kids. 

You don't need to smash your PISA results to see that's deeply unfair, and a waste of human potential.

Birmingham's response is especially smarmy when you realise Australian students have gone backwards relative to their international peers, but also relative to Australian 15-year-olds in 2000 when PISA started.  </TEXT>

This discussion is a hot topic across /r/technology.

Australia is set to criminalise crypto research of government public data sets. Nine days remain to comment. So far there are two responses.

https://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/5gw8ix/australia_is_set_to_criminalise_crypto_research/

It's likely to kill set back online privacy research in Australia, leave our data (including metadata) more vulnerable, and put researchers at risk of prosecution.

Sadly, many of us who'd post this kind of info to /r/Australia have been banned, so it's mostly being discussed by Americans. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed, it's endemic, but I don't think it has to do with not knowing. 

It's a sly method of casting doubt on an opinion they disagree with. They're asking questions instead of clearly expressing their own opinions, in order to make force you into being defensive without exposing their own position to scrutiny.

Superficially, it can seem reasonable, but in practice, it's pushing the onus of effort to one side of the discussion without contributing anything of equal value.

<TEXT> Good on you.


Sealioning is a nasty practice, and more of us should stand up to them. If /u/electronicwhale was genuinely interested, they would have done their own digging based on your statements, and only asked for obscure or difficult-to-discover information.


FWIW, I checked how hard it was to find the information by Googling 'How long can police keep your dna on file "South Australia"', and the first link in the search result had enough information to validate that /u/AdamDaze was essentially correct.

The purpose of sealioning never to actually learn or become more informed. The purpose is to interrogate. Much like actual interrogators, sealioners bombard the target with question after question, digging and digging until the target either says something stupid or is so pissed off that they react in the extreme.


/u/AdamDaze responded politely, and explained reasonably that he was entitled to post an opinion without having to provide full cites. This is, after all,  a discussion forum, not an academic journal.  </TEXT>

For my location and current electricity costs, it takes too long to get the return for batteries to be viable, but with falling battery costs and ramping grid prices, we'll get to a cost/benefit crossover point eventually.

And since the WA gov't is planning on selling Western power, it'll most likely happen sooner rather than later, and when it does, it won't be a few nerds playing with new tech, it'll be a cascade of people escaping from expensive services. </TEXT>

In a stunning admission more than 12 months after Fairfax Media revealed concerns that the petroleum resource rent tax was being gamed by the biggest fossil fuel multinationals, Mr Morrison conceded on Wednesday: "We think it is a problem."


At a time when Australia's treasurer was forced to admit that the multinational companies he wants to cut tax for have been stealing billions of dollars from the Australian people, parliament and most of the media are bickering over backpacker taxes.

Recovering tax from multinationals will allow better services and infrastructure for all Australians. 

Recovering tax from backpackers will barely cover the cost of collecting it.

Of course Turnbull, Morrison, Cormann etc would rather have the crossbenchers and media chasing that fruit-picking red herring. That's what it's for, so they don't have to do anything.

I kid you not, that's what happened.


Mr Hinch switched his vote after a discussion with Treasurer Scott Morrison at the Prime Ministers Christmas BBQ on Sunday.

Mr Morrison had indicated the government would not agree to a 15 per cent compromise to break the stalemate before announcing it the next morning, leaving Mr Hinch furious.


The issue must be resolved by tomorrow, before parliament rises for the year, otherwise backpackers will be hit with a 32.5 per cent tax.

As a result, Hinch said the government should pass Labors 10.5 per cent proposal.

Hockey may be involved and potentially culpable, but chasing him is a distraction from the real problem.

As MaevaM says below, "It doesnt really matter what Hockey did", what matters is what Brandis et al are still doing.

Funnily enough, I expected Dutton to chime in with a red herring for the press to chase, and wasn't expecting Hockey to be the fall guy. For the LNP, it makes sense though. Hockey's already been exposed as a buffoon and shipped out of the local political battlefield. Adding another screw-up to his career list won't change anything for him or for the LNP. </TEXT>

So, not only is the policy costly and failing to achieve reductions required to meet our commitments, it is being overwhelmed by state land clearing. None of this adds up to success.

The federal government is paying businesses billions to plant trees. The state governments are allowing businesses to make billions cutting down trees.

<TEXT> It'd be fun to map Darwin's density against the suburbs that'll be under water by 2050.


CoastAdapt provides estimates of future sea-level rise out to 2050 and 2100 for four greenhouse gas concentration scenarios.

Predictions estimate by 2030 the sea level could have risen by 10cm, by 2050 it would have risen between 20 to 25cm and will continue to trend upward to 2100 and beyond.

In all of the scenarios, parts of Cullen Bay, Parap, Fannie Bay, Rapid Creek, Coconut Grove and Bayview go underwater.

The scenarios do not take into account wave height, storm surges or flooding.

<TEXT> Not just Hockey and Tones. When this was first reported, it was clear that there were a number of key LNP leaders involved.

WA Treasurer Mike Nahan had received personal and written assurances early last year from then Federal counterpart Joe Hockey that the Commonwealth would not oppose the State Governments move.

On the weekend of April 2-3, just two days before the High Court hearing, Mr Mischin repeatedly called Senator Brandis and Assistant Treasurer Kelly ODwyer to seek an agreement that would avert Commonwealth involvement in the case

Given the calls to Treasury and the AG, it seems highly unlikely that Abbott/Turnbull, as well as Cormann and Morrison were not also made aware of it. In fact, if they weren't, there should be an inquiry into why MPs are withholding vital information from the PM.

The fact that these stories are so universal tells us there's something about them that's close to the heart of humanity, some deep ties to melancholy and grief.

Worked for several years in mine surveying, until EDMs and data recorders started hitting the market. Caught the handheld computer wave when the original Palm Pilot came out, and made good money for a while developing and doing field data collection. Moved on when it was clear that field was saturated, and transitioned to developing videos and training, and sometimes consulting. 

Each change took a different mindset, but was not more difficult than the previous career. Some were very lucrative - at one stage I was measuring my income by seeing how early in the year I could earn the average Australian wage.

<TEXT> You're right, and Xiaomi grew to be the biggest-selling phone maker in China with around 2% margins, or as low as $3 per phone. 

By managing supply chain, long tails on their model ranges and keeping minimal inventory, they were able to sell hundreds of millions of very good phones at very low prices. 

They made it very clear that they were making money off the whole ecosystem they were building, and in fact call themselves a software company, not a phone maker.

Of course, Apple does a similar thing, charging fees for everything their users interact with, from the App Store to the headphones and dongles you'll need to use their products.

Having access to phones from both companies, I can categorically state that the Xiaomi phones are as or more capable than the far more costly iPhones. </TEXT>

Lower tax rates do not boost growth and jobs

Conservatives claim reducing the corporate tax rate will substantially grow the economy. But a cut in the statutory rate from 35% to 25% would increase economic output by less than two-tenths of one percent, according to CRS. Economic growth over the past 60 years has actually been stronger when corporate tax rates were higher, according to the Economic Policy Institute. U.S. corporate tax rates also are not hurting profits  before-tax and after-tax corporate profits as a percentage of national income are at postWorld War II highs.

There is no relationship between cutting corporate tax rates and job growth, according to a recent study by the Center for Effective Government. Twenty-two of the 30 profitable Fortune 500 companies that paid the highest tax rates (30% or more) from 2008 to 2010 created almost 200,000 jobs between 2008 and 2012. The 30 profitable corporations that paid little or no taxes over the three years collectively shed 51,289 jobs between 2008 and 2012.

Low corporate tax rates dont create jobs. According to The Corporate Tax Rate Debate, a new report by the Center for Effective Government, among the 30 firms with the lowest corporate tax rates between 2008 and 2010, half the firms created jobs and half shed jobs over the last five years.

Only two of the 30 firms paid taxes over the threeyear period, despite the fact that each of the firms was profitable in each of the three years and collectively reported $159 billion in U.S. profits. As a group, the lowtax corporations shed more than 51,000 since 2008.


Our results suggest that increases in corporate tax rates uniformly reduce employment and income while corporate tax cuts are ineffectual in boosting economic activity except when they are implemented during recessions, the study concludes. Tax cuts, on the other hand, are only effective in recessions, when they raise employment by around 0.6% and income from employment by around 1% for every percentage point cut in the tax rate.


According to a new study by the Congressional Research Service (non-partisan), there's no evidence that tax cuts spur growth.

In fact, although correlation is not causation, when you compare economic growth in periods with declining tax rates versus periods with high tax rates, there seems to be evidence that tax cuts might hurt growth.

Right now you can buy an ESP 8266 dev board for less than $5, write a Basic script in a web browser, and with a bit of breadboard wiring, have a kit that'll let you read sensors, switch lights, relays etc, 20 minutes after first powering the thing up.

That's the kind of wild west environment that lets innovation run rampant. Sure, it's ridiculously insecure, and products made with it shouldn't be used in anyplace where it matters, but security has to be iterative anyway.

Capitalism's supposed to work this way. Thousands of small disruptive startups propagate in a new field, but are gradually thinned down to a few high-quality survivors by the heat of free market selection.

Infrastructure opportunity knocked  Canberra wasn't home. Still isn't

The commonwealth government started this financial year able to borrow money for 10 years at about 1.8 per cent.


You could say a wonderful opportunity was missed to borrow very cheaply to invest in infrastructure that would pay for itself several times over.

That sort of borrowing is what financial advisors explain to retail-level customers as "good debt". It's the sort of debt our central bankers have tried to explain to the government as sound economic policy to help Australia realise its potential by improving productivity and our quality of life, paying fat economic dividends for years to come.

An asylum seeker named Amin Afravi had been bashed by two guards on Manus Island on Friday night, she reported, after they found him trying to hang himself. "The bashing was accompanied by racial abuse," she added. "He now has broken ribs and has difficulty breathing."


Mr Afravi, 28, is a case in point. His throat was cut the day before Mr Barati was slain and he says he still suffers nerve damage from the injury that makes it hard to breathe, and a host of other physical conditions.

Mr Afravi suffered minor burns to his face after he tried to self-immolate about five weeks ago.

His trauma is greater because he says the Australian security guard who witnessed his throat being slashed, and would have been prepared to identify the culprit, was transferred from the centre after the attack, beaten by local guards and returned to Australia.

Broadspectrum said any questions should be directed to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. A department spokesman said a "minor incident" was being investigated and no injuries had been reported.

<TEXT> Sounds like she had to be attached to Cormann in order to get the job done.

Senator Cameron claimed Employment Minister Michaelia Cash could not operate in the Senate without Senator Cormann holding her hand.

"Senator Cormann, I know you have to be there to hold the Minister's hand," he said.

"So maybe just hold the minister's hand and stop interjecting, would be a good start. That would be a good start."

<TEXT> Australian workplace Health and Safety has always been based a tripartite system of workers, employers and government holding each other accountable. The ABCC weakens the ability of the workers HSRs (union Health and Safety Reps) to influence the other two parties.

Under the Howard-era ABCC, workplace fatalities in the construction sector rose from just over three per 100,000 workers to nearly five per 100,000 workers before falling again to around four. After the neutering of the ABCC, the fatality rate fell to just over two. Getting rid of the ABCC coincided with a significant fall in the number of workers being killed on building sites."

In essence, without a strong third party to stand up to bad governments and bad employers, people get killed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, they believe in supply-side economics, Reaganomics, Thatcherism, etc instead. 

Money flows up faster than it does down. Each dollar of corporate tax cuts returns 50 cents to revenue, so, over the long-term, the revenue lost by tax cuts will be only partially regained. Without a decrease in spending, tax cuts lead to an increase in the budget deficit. That harms the economy over time, and leads to flat wages and job losses.

Mining giant Rio Tinto to axe hundreds of jobs in Perth, Pilbara

RIO Tinto is preparing to sack up to 500 workers ahead of the March State election, a move likely to exacerbate tensions between the States biggest miner and WA Nationals leader Brendon Grylls.

Pushing out a story blaming Fraser allows Australia's flaccid media contingent to waffle over something irrelevant instead of discussing real news.

Mr Crepeau called on Australia to stop intercepting and pushing back asylum-seeker boats, saying the practice does not meet human rights obligations.

He questioned the difference in treatment of asylum seekers who arrive by boat with those who come by plane, despite acknowledging the theory that it sends a message to people smugglers.

"In the human rights doctrine you cannot punish John in order to prevent Bill from doing something," he told reporters.

<TEXT> Actually, real analysis shows that immigrants tend to go into "catch-up" mode when they arrive in Australia, and work hard to earn as quickly as possible to level their wealth with native born Australians.

That means they are effectively contributing the same amount in terms of job creation and infrastructure improvements as native-born Australians, but they're tending to do so over a shorter time span.

Australia also gains the benefit of their prior schooling and experience without having to pay while they're developing those skills.

While this study finds that immigrants accumulate less wealth than their Australian-born counterparts throughout the entire distribution, there is evidence of catch-up. Through greater time in Australia and accumulation of human capital, the disadvantaged wealth position of immigrants appears to recede. 

A further encouraging finding is that children of immigrants appear to experience no discrimination in relation to wealth accumulation.

Mr Ciobo will not countenance a new US posture on trade, despite Mr Trump's campaign rhetoric about joining or retaliating against a "trade war" against China, Vietnam, India and others who export to the US.

"It's crucial for a trade minister, indeed for any government, to make the case for free trade and liberalised trade, to join the dots in a very clear way so that Australians get that as a consequences of trade agreements we undertake," he said.



"It's not about losing jobs or outsourcing work, it's actually about opening markets for Australian exports."

<TEXT> Base load power: a myth used to defend the fossil fuel industry

According to Tim Buckley, from the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, the idea of base load generation as an essential part of the energy mix is becoming redundant, and turning into a myth dreamed up by the fossil fuel industry to protect its interests.

Its as dangerous as the marketing term of clean coal and the idea that coal is good for humanity, Buckley says.


http://reneweconomy.com.au/base-load-power-a-myth-used-to-defend-the-fossil-fuel-industry-96007/

Baseload power is a myth: even intermittent renewables will work


Ben Elliston, Iain MacGill and I have performed thousands of computer simulations of 100% renewable electricity in the National Electricity Market (NEM), using actual hourly data on electricity demand, wind and solar power for 2010. Our latest research, available here and reported here, finds that generating systems comprising a mix of different commercially available renewable energy technologies, located on geographically dispersed sites, do not need base-load power stations to achieve the same reliability as fossil-fuelled systems.

https://theconversation.com/baseload-power-is-a-myth-even-intermittent-renewables-will-work-13210

Can renewables provide baseload power?

What The Science Says:

Numerous case studies on both regional and global scales have determined that renewable energy, if properly implemented, can provide baseload power.

Moreover, 2.433 million Australians (18.8% of the workforce) are either unemployed or under-employed.

It's a result the Government has trumpeted as a ringing endorsement of the strength of the Australian economy. But scratch beneath the surface and you see how misleading the headline numbers are.

<TEXT> In the latest news from the Turnbull government front, they've decided to make it easier for employers to drive down 457 visa holders' pay.

Dr Howe said todays announcement would result in 457 visa holders having very little freedom of movement in the Australian labour market and increase the power employers could exert over foreign workers.

It effectively gives employers the dual role of both employer and immigration sponsor, she said.

By having two hats, which they dont have with a local worker, the employers power is increased to a point where they can exert pressure over a worker to get them to do whatever they want them to do.

<TEXT> Gee, I wonder why?

THE International Monetary Fund has fired a broadside at Canberra, urging the Federal Government to accelerate spending on infrastructure while warning against trying to wipe the Budget deficit too quickly.

And it has taken aim at Australias rising household debt levels, claiming the nations tax system encourages households to gorge on debt to invest in property, in turn exacerbating the peaks and troughs of cycles in house prices.

<TEXT> The Chinese company that wrote the software says they also did it for "research and productivity".


Adups told the Times that the software was not meant for US phones. In June 2016, some Blu Product, Inc. devices applied a version of the ADUPS [firmware] application that inadvertently included the functionality of flagging junk texts and calls that had been requested by other ADUPS clients, the company said in a statement to The Verge. When Blu raised objections, ADUPS took immediate measures to disable that functionality on Blu phones. The company says the data was not provided to others and has been deleted.

Despite the company's statement, it's hard to know whether malicious surveillance  is intended or a byproduct in circumstances like this.

<TEXT> Donald Trump is the USA's equivalent to our own Malcolm Turnbull. Elected as a business success. Trumpeted as an agent of change, someone different. We've been down this road before.

He will be about as effective in government  as Turnbull has been. 


It was all a bait   switch.

To sum up, this is the prospect we are facing. A populist but semi-engaged President who is less interested in governing than in soaking up adulation at big rallies. (He might hold more of them even though the campaign is over, the Times story said.) Meanwhile, his cronies and members of the permanent establishment make many of the actual decisions, which will largely benefit the already rich, including the ruling family. Debt mushrooms as El Presidente approves prestige construction projects but not the taxes needed to pay for them. And skilled propagandists, like Bannon, whip up nationalist fervor to keep the masses diverted from what is really going on.

<TEXT> Microsoft ARE paying the price for arrogance though.

If you look at device shipments in 2015, it shows that Windows was on less than 12% of them. 

Device Shipments, 2015

1. Android 54.16%
2. iOS/OS X 12.37%
3. Windows 11.79%
4. Other 21.66%





And in fact, actual usage of Windows 10 went backwards in September, so they'll be bleeding installed base as well:


It was expected, that once Windows 10 stopped being free, upgrades would slow significantly. That turned out not to be the case last month when NetMarketShares usage figures showed it, rather surprisingly, to be business as usual. Growth in August was no different from growth in previous months, although I speculated it might have been buoyed by sales of new back to school PCs.

In September though, according to NetMarketShare, Windows 10 didnt just show slower growth, it actually went into reverse gear and lost usage share. Yes, you read that right.

The specific technique they are using in this instance is intended to get you to look past the sale - eg, not about whether you really want a mediocre chocolate, but which mediocre chocolate you will buy.


The two questions you should really ask are:

1. Do you **really** want or need the snack, given that you're being manipulated into desiring it?


2. Why have shitty oversugared Cadbury chocolate when you can have much nicer treats for the same price?

Peer reviewed studies suggest the opposite:




Conclusion: The total annual direct cost of overweight and obesity in Australia in 2005 was $21 billion, substantially higher than previous estimates. There is financial incentive at both individual and societal levels for overweight and obese people to lose weight and/or reduce WC.

https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2010/192/5/cost-overweight-and-obesity-australia


Health problems related to excess weight impose substantial economic burdens on individuals, families and communities. Data from the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study indicate that the total direct cost for overweight and obesity in 2005 was $21 billion ($6.5 billion for overweight and $14.5 billion for obesity). The same study estimated indirect costs of $35.6 billion per year, resulting in an overall total annual cost of $56.6 billion (Colagiuri et al. 2010).

You've suggested average (not median, which is more indicative given increasing inequality) incomes have grown less than 10x. 

You've compared a midrange car with an economy car to support that claim. At the same time as the Cortina you've quoted, a Mini was about $1300, 120Y $2,000, base Escort or Gemini not much more.

You've attempted to conflate the cost of a single item with overall cost of living, but in 1975 fuel was 60 cents a gallon (13.2cpl). Bread was 24c a loaf. A median house in Sydney was $28,000. A newspaper was 12c. 25c would buy you a middy of beer.

<TEXT> Do you have any evidence to support that assertion? 

More people are working longer hours to maintain their living standard, and now that unemployment is rising, projections show living standards falling for almost everyone below median income over the next decade.

Figure 1b shows, in real terms, both the level of and the growth of incomes between 2004 and 2014 and the projection to 2024. The gap between the income of the lowest income households is  substantial and growing through time. Of great concern is that the incomes of the lowest two quintiles are actually projected to fall over the next 10 years.

http://www.abc.net.au/cm/lb/6802166/data/natsem-report-into-living-standard-trends-data.pdf


In addition, the number of hours worked to maintain a median income has been increasing

It is interesting to note that in addition to working longer average hours, the last couple of decades have seen a marked increase in the proportion of persons working very long hours (49+ per week). In 1980 just 21 per cent of all full-timers (male and female) were working very long hours; by 2000 this proportion had risen to 33 per cent. For many white-collar workers, these additional hours are being worked as unpaid overtime.(8)

<TEXT> Some cognitive dissonance here...

However, Apple posted a somewhat disappointing end to its fiscal year last month as iPhone unit sales slipped 5% year over year and revenue slid 13%. Apples Mac business was also down, and its iPad operation was stagnant.

Since the analyst involved counts total global sales numbers, but excludes profits from large Chinese companies that don't report profit figures, I'd take their conclusions with a grain of salt.

<TEXT> I was kind of kidding, but the NodeMCUs are genuinely exciting little gadgets.

I bought them as part of an ongoing project to convert as much of my house   garden to 12v as practical, automate where possible, and to transition to stored solar as advances/cost reductions make it worthwhile. So all lights are now LED, security and entertainment stuff all 12 or 5v, etc etc. Making it simple and friendly (eg via web page, tv screen, phone or tablet) takes lots of relays and electronic controllers. An example is having my driveway and carport lights automatically switch on when it's dark and my phone joins the wifi network as I get back from work or pub.

There's also some potential to use the experience to make salable products (I work in the field).

The benefits of the ESP8266 boards over Arduino are:

USB-TTL included, plug play

10 GPIO, every GPIO can be PWM, I2C, 1-wire

Built-in wifi, incl PCB antenna, gets 40-50m easily

Open source soft, firm and hardware

Easily flashable with scripting environments inc MicroPython, eLua, Basic, etc

FWIW, when I first got them, I flashed one with ESP8266 Basic, wired a 12v relay to an electronic door lock I had spare, scripted a web button to open it, powered up and had it working in less than 15 minutes. And I'm a clod who struggles with Bash scripts...

These little things really put the rapid back in RAD... When you get all that in such a tiny and cheap gadget, it's hard to resist. </TEXT>

I've just bought half a dozen $5 NodeMCU ESP8266 boards and need to decide which language to use on them. They come with Lua installed, which I'd need to learn. I'm more familiar with Python, but MicroPython doesn't look production ready yet. The ESP8266 Basic project looks useful and has good examples, but may have limits I'm not aware of yet.

<TEXT> The good news is that peer reviews show that Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is about as effective as pharmaceuticals, and has lower risks.

What that means though, is that it's not going to work all the time, every time. It's basically learning a new skill, and takes time, patience and practice, not something you want to hear when you're dealing with depression now.

But, like u/Azzanine has said, exercising the injury is really the only way forward, and that means you'll get to deal with the pain and the two-steps-forwards, one-step-backwards frustrations inherent with it.

But, it's worth knowing it **can** work. Just not always and not easily. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That may well be, though it's not the real reason MS is losing browser share.

If you look at device shipments in 2015, it shows that Windows was on less than 12% of them. It's fair to assume that most of the other 88% of devices  can have Chrome or Firefox installed on them, while IE and Edge can only exist on Windows.

Device Shipments, 2015

Android	54.16%

iOS/OS X	12.37%

Windows	11.79%

Other	21.66%

TLDR:

MS browsers only survive on installed base. New shipments overwhelmingly favour other OSs. </TEXT>

ReacOS had about $150,000 in the bank and about $3,000 in donations [in 2014](http://ev.reactos.org/files/GA2014.pdf). Their expenses were about $6,000, so they went backwards.

<TEXT>  AOSP a less complete OS

Is been a while since Android 7.0 Nougat has been out. If you have a Nexus device which is currently supported, you already have your taste of the latest Android in most cases. But if you are a non-Nexus user, you would be lucky if your OEM even promised you an update, let alone deliver it so soon already.

This is where the developer community comes in  groups of talented individuals working together to achieve the common cause of getting the latest Android onto devices before the OEM can, and in many cases, because the OEM cant.

With the large amount of unofficial builds of Android 7.0 Nougat and CyanogenMod 14 builds rolling in, it was a good idea to to create a big list of devices that have already tasted the dessert success.

<TEXT> AOSP is the official Android open source repository. The official website is at Android Open Source Project . If you go and have a look at the URL: Codenames, Tags, and Build Numbers you will find all the builds from Google.(Build here means the android OS files with some supporting files) . Ex: google developed Marshmallow and the complete code is available for downloading as it is open source.

What companies like Samsung, HTC or CM (in this case) do? They download this source code and modify it in the way they want. They will add some extra features on top of the original os and flash it on the devices like HTC, Samsung etc. CM is one such customized ROM.

A case can be initiated by a candidate or voter, through a petition under the Commonwealth Electoral Act, disputing the result. Parliament can put a question before the High Court regarding the validity of someone s election. It is also possible that any person may seek enforcement of a penalty against a person who has taken a seat in the parliament in breach of the Constitution or electoral act. This right to sue is created by the Common Informers (Parliamentary Disqualifications) Act 1975. The first two of these approaches have both been used successfully in the last two decades (for details, see below).

<TEXT> There is a data base listing every claim that employers can access, forget any hope of a job once there.

Ok, now this just isn't true. 

Each state in Australia has a different compo system. WA, for example. has a fully privatised system where employers pay insurance companies for cover, eg CGU, Alliance etc. SA has a mandatory mutual assurance scheme, NSW is a hybrid, which allows self-insurance, Vic is similar to SA, but has a different funding process, etc, etc.

One thing that's across all states however is that privacy laws restrict access to personal records. Companies can only see records for their own workers. It's also an offence for a company to refuse employment based on prior claims.

Don't be scared into not claiming compensation you're entitled to.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bishop hounded Gillard about her time as a Lawyer with Slater   Gordon. Don't you think it's a bit hypocritical to defend her when her own tactics are used?

Besides, the delaying methods Bishop used to block compensation for CSR's victims may have been legal, but was exploiting court procedures, not laws. It was never intended they be used to deny the opportunity to find judgement, so Bishop's use of them to ensure mesothelioma sufferers died before getting to court was unethical even by corporate lawyer standards.

She used those methods BECAUSE she knew the dying people were entitled to compensation. 

And unlike many of us who may have had to perform nasty tasks on behalf of an employer, Bishop has said she is still proud of the work she did, no regrets.

Nasty. </TEXT>

Apparently not:

The kids get off The Claw and said one of their belt buckles come undone right up in the air. I told the attendants  they didnt listen. I went and told the manager, and he said he will call someone to go have a look, yet they continued to let people on the ride and keep operating, she wrote.

I went back to the manager and questioned it and he tells me that the belt buckle is an added safety feature Dreamworld added to the seats, so if they come undone they are still safe."

<TEXT> Blockchain contracts aren't just agreements, they are (or can be) computer programs that can check if criteria are met, then actually do things when that happens.

In the test case this story is about, the blockchain transaction is mirroring the normal practice of a bank letter of credit, and release of funds on approval, so there is no benefit to the transaction, apart from testing the tool. But that's like saying a computer is no more use than typewriter because the first you used it was to write a letter.


Once the technology is settled, blockchain contracts could transparently and unalterably encapsulate quite complex agreed conditions between multiple companies or individuals and automatically enact them as those conditions are met.

There would be no need for escrow agents or any other middlemen, and the transactions need not involve actual money. Direct transfer or exchange of ownership, products or services could be encoded into the blockchain safely.

<TEXT> There was an opportunity for Intel to make tablet/phone SoCs that were as open as PCs used to be, and would allow any OS to be installed on them. That would have given them the market advantage that would have kept the range alive.


Instead, they flinched and released locked-down broken EFIs and other weird shit that made the hardware as OS-tied as the ARM/MIPS etc competitors. 

Without a reason to exist, they soon won't.

<TEXT> I've been involved in helping select candidates for a few positions recently, when HR has been swamped with applications. 

The triaging technique is based around first-pass elimination, then proper review of any who haven't eliminated themselves. The front page of your resume should be geared towards getting you into the "review" pile, and yours isn't helping you make the cut. 

The advice from other people here, particularly /u/istara is good, but the first text below your name, availability and contact details should be a concise bullet-pointed list of the job's requirements and your ability to meet them. 

An example for a pizza delivery job would be:

- Own reliable car

- Clean drivers license and exemplary safety record

- Presentable appearance and personal hygiene

- Ability to answer phones, take orders using computerized POS, and assisting staff in the kitchen

- [etc](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant ion=1 espv=2 ie=UTF-8#q=pizza%20delivery%20driver%20skills)

You can then add more skills, attributes and experience in the following pages if you want to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They're also quite misleading.

Australian cattle and sheep are mostly grass-fed in open pasture, or are used in crop rotation systems to convert grain stubble and nitrogen-fixing legumes into fertiliser and meat. Most of the biomass they eat is inedible to humans, and having them on fallow paddocks increases grain and vegetable yields.

Likewise, the water use claims are based on total consumption, (eg, from farm dams, rainwater etc) not on actually available water that could be used for other purposes, and are also based only on the extremely intensive styles of livestock farming rarely used in Australia. In reality, the water use per kilo of beef is close to parity with many vegetables.

Think about it yourself. How often do you see irrigation running on non-productive pastures? How often do you see cattle, sheep etc in ordinary open grassed paddocks? Which of these is more common?


Google around a bit. The info provided by /u/sixteen_weasels comes verbatim from a vegan site, and is a good wake-up call, but there's plenty of counterpoint data out there too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Turnbull deserves it.

He was well aware that a review and decision on the National Firearms Agreement was required before the sunset clause expired, and failed to make that happen.


Whatever you think about the actual merits of the argument, most of the chaos and dissonance could have been avoided by actually doing the work before the deadline. It's not like he didn't know about the agreement - he was [pontificating about it](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/28/australias-gun-laws-non-negotiable-says-turnbull-on-port-arthur-massacre-anniversary) in April.

All that was needed was a bit of leadership and decisiveness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not really. In theory, it's about the capacity:

The five-shot version of the weapon  which can pump out five bullets before being reloaded  can be legally purchased in Australia and is categorised as a category A gun which has the least restrictions around ownership.

The eight shot version of the lever action shotgun is temporarily banned. But critics say its pointless banning one and not the other as the five shot can be easily  and legally  adjusted to fire 11 slugs, more than the version that is banned.

In practice, it's about avoiding negative publicity, and maintaining the somewhat meaningless ban enacted by Tony Abbott.  </TEXT>

The idea was that each worker would buy the machine that replaced him/her and live on the subsequent output of that machine.

As you've noted, the companies wanted no part of it, and preferred to sack the workers and keep the efficiencies for themselves. I have no doubt the result will be the same this time around. </TEXT>

Interestingly though, there have been questions raised about the safety of pairing Quick Charge 3.0 with the USB C port used on the Note.

Since the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge both have the same SoC as the Note 7 but retain the older MicroUSB port (and do not blow up), that could be a place to look for the battery damage culprit.

<TEXT> Lithium is less of a problem than the flammable electrolytes needed to make it work. Sodium batteries go part way to resolving that issue, but give up some energy density as a result.

For the moment, sodium batteries have a storage capacity of 90Wh/kg, which is comparable to early lithium batteries. Current lithium batteries, like the self-immolating Samsung ones, have a capacity of around 130Wh/kg. </TEXT>

Nanotech punchcards are very robust and quite fast if they're used in a massively parallel reader. 

The downside is that pushing the chads out is really hard on the old eyes, and if you ever drop the deck, you'll need to gather them fast before pigeons mistake them for rice grains and eat them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Gradststs website is where most of the data originates.

http://www.graduatecareers.com.au/research/researchreports/gradstats/


The key take-away is that only 68% of bachelor graduates from the class of 2014 had a full-time job four months after graduating. That is the lowest full-time employment rate for new graduates since Graduate Careers Australia began measuring in 1982.

<TEXT> GDP per capita has been flat for the past few years, and disposable income per capita has been falling since 2010.

The largest contributor to GDP growth has been household spending, which is why we now have the highest unconsolidated household debt to GDP in the world.

TLDR, Our GDP is just starting to show we're still spending like we're rich, but starting to realise it's all on credit. When the debt comes due, our GDB will slump like it's been king hit by a giant speed-raging bogan.

<TEXT> What you're doing is called framing. It's narrowing the focus of discussion to a point where you can gain grudging agreement on one small aspect of the topic, then claim it validates your whole point.


It's a dishonest technique, and you should stop using it. 

In this instance for example, the absence of statistics on the tax-payments of people who are able to hide their taxable income means nothing. </TEXT>

Me, I think they do, and that all of the other non-statistical evidence that's available is far more damning of government and wealthy connivance than a spreadsheet or two.
