<TEXT> When I was a kid (maybe 10 years old), my mom gave me money to pay for some school stuff. I told her I accidentally lost some of it, but what I really did was, that I bought a small LEGO set. She had financial problems at the time, and she was angry that I "lost" it. I've never told her what I did. 

Even though I often payed her bills when I got older, and "lend" her some money, it still haunts me to this day because I consider myself a good guy.

<TEXT> 1. Imagine getting a period, being punched in the stomach, and getting sick. At the same time. 

That's the reason we can't even move for a while after someone punches us in the balls.

2. I have no problem with sharing. The problem becomes when you don't know how the woman will react. It can make us look soft even if we are not. That is often a turn off for women. 

3. My GF gave birth 4 months ago. I felt even bigger respect for her, she took it like a champ and all the time I was wishing for it to be over asap so she can get some rest. She is awesome 3

EDIT: grammar and additional answers

<TEXT> i get that, i might get it work, but i probably wouldnt. I was just wondering if the companies that do this kind of work on a regular basis, bought the basic designs and then remoded them, or do you actually have to measure every micrometer of the factory slide, if you want to do anything with it?

<TEXT> Its not really pain, but really hyper sensitivity. It does not hurt but its very very unpleasant. 

When its good, its because my penis is well lubed. Only then I get really great sensation from it.

Sometimes i envy uncircumcised guys and i wonder how would sex and everything else feel.
I also had some problems with premature ejaculation due to being more sensitive, but this can be avoided with regular sex.  </TEXT>

But bus driver refused to leave the station without the dumfuck leaving the bus. 
People on the bus got annoyed and the thug went to the bus driver, started to give him shit and telling him to drive. 
Driver doesnt give a shit, stands up. Opens the door, punches the guy in the face and i shit you know, does the "this is sparta kick" and kicks him out of the door.

<TEXT> I have one lv 110 toon, which is my main of course. Im a very casual player (fucked up work schedule, GF, kid on the way) and i dont have a lot of time to play, but i do want to make my playing time as efficient as possible.

Im trying to shuffle some gold lately, were doing flasks but no luck with rank 3, now im doing the trinket shuffle which is decent. But since i don't play alot, i burn trough BoS too quickly. I have Alchemy and Herbalism. But farming BoS with herba is too random.

My point is: should i change herba to skinning? Or should i lv up my alt (dk lv 90 or warrior from scratch), and use one of those for skinning and lw or something else.

Not trying to be lazy, i just don't wanna lose herbalism if its not worth it, and i dont have much xp with other professions to make a judgement call by myself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have only one 110 char with alch and herbalism. I am quite a casual player, so i dont have alot of time to run heroics for bloods. Should i drop herbalism for skinning? Im having trouble acquiring bloods for my trinket shuffle.

Or is it better to get my other char (90 dk) to 110 and get him skinning?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Starting making gold with Alchemy. Today. Worth it? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-02 17:59:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Meaning that I wasnt playing wow when the legion gold train started at launch, when everyone could make profits with mats. I haven't really made any money since cata, back then I was farming a lot and selling potions. But I wanted to make some gold with alchemy again, but I just started. 
The problem is, I'm sitting on around 40k, don't have a lot of time to farm mats, and the mats for flasks are a lot more expensive than the cost of actual flask. So basically my only way of trying to get to rank 3 is to buy mats and sell flasks, while losing money. Hoping i dont lose everything before i get to rank 3. 
Is what im doing worth it at all? I'm basically crossing fingers to get lucky on the rank 3 recipe.... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got back to wow a month ago, very casually playing since TBC (my job schedule sucks ballz, kid on the way, etc.) and I've been mostly playing a mage.
 I do however have a shammy on lv 35 that I would like to make it a 110 as a ench. 
But I've been so out of the loop that I'm having trouble figuring out which heirlooms should i be looking at. I found mostly old articles on the topic online, so no much luck on figuring this out on my own... if anyone has any 2 cents to add, please do!

Thank you all 3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Back in high school. Played video games until 3 am. Had to wake up and go to train at 6:15 am. But i wake up thinking my alarm didn't went off. I panic and check the clock,  my vision was all blurry but i was sure it said 6:00 on the clock. SHIT! I got dressed and ran like hell to the train station. I don't know why it wasn't odd to me at that point, that there is no one around but me, and there was still pitch dark.
Got to the empty train station. My vision not so blurry anymore. Checked my watch. It was 4:15.

<TEXT> Hello there fellow redditors! I've been lurking this sub for a while now. I'm currently in the process of getting a gun permit, and it's going to be a first piece for me. Since the process is quite long in my country, i have some time to plan ahead. 

I will choose Glock as my first gun. Thinking about 17/19 but will probably take 17. I plan on competing. I heard Glock might not be the best choice, but since i'm a total beginner, i think it won't really matter from the start.
What i would like to ask you is, which sights mod would you recommend for competition shooting? I don't want to mod the gun too much (will probably get a new trigger with 3,5lb pull once i get used to the gun, and some stippling job if needed).
Would you recommend anything else than practice, practice, eat, sleep, practice, practice?

Thank you a lot!

EDIT: forgot to ask about good holsters and belt for practical and competition shooting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It actually has different names in some countries. Overall name is Floorball, in Sweden they call it Innebandy, in Finnland its Salibandy.

Its very fast-paced and you must be agile as hell to play it. I love it. I've been playing it for almost 10 years now. 

Wikipedia has quite long article about it, also check youtube for instructional videos. If you want to see more action, try searching for world championship finals. It's always Sweden and Finnland (because those guys are gods when it comes to this sport).

I love the game, the lore, story, co-op,... 

I haven't and I will not lose hope for The Division. Developers showed today that they're working as fast as they can to fix things, when they fixed some major glitches during the same  day.

So please. No whining. Give them chance.

casual player, who still loves the game. And the game is a beauty. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im quite a beginner when it comes to whiskey, but im starting to really enjoy it (26M). Really interested in getting more in to it.

Since i have limited knowledge on the matter i thought if any of you can help.

My father got [this whiskey](http://imgur.com/NKirPGx) as a gift when i was born. He gave it to me for my 18th birthday. And i promised to him that i won't open it until my first child is born and we can drink it together.

Im curious about the brand though. Have no idea if this is some cheap bottle or something i could look forward to trying. Will drink it anyway though.

<TEXT> i'm an amateur comedian. I always had a wish that if i knew when i'm going to die, i would record a few-minute act to show at the funeral. It would mostly be dark jokes about my death of course. If people will cry at my funeral, i would like if at least some of them would do it out of laughter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thomas Chrn was Slovenian Bishop. He was the leading force behind the Counter-Reformation in Carniola, and Protestantism was suppressed in his diocese between 1600 and 1603. He was responsible for burning loads of very valuable books and translated texts that were some of the first in the slovenian language. However, Jurij Dalmatin's Bible translation was retained and he received papal permission to use it, thereby preserving its linguistic and literary tradition. </TEXT>
