<TEXT> Before I get into the meat of what I wish was an ongoing nightmare, I'd like to point out the fact that this is my first time posting on nosleep let alone telling anybody about whats been happening to me besides my girlfriend. Im a finance major so writing has never particularly been a strong-suit of mine; but I'll tell the tale as well as I can regardless.

Let me first preface this story by giving a little bit of a background on myself. I'm currently an 18 year old African American male preparing to finish out my first year in college. I go to the University of Nebraska Lincolnriveting place, I knowand I'm in a fraternity called Phi Delta Theta. All of *this* started sometime last week and I haven't been able to sleep the same since. 

I was on my way to my girlfriend's dorm; mind you, the way our campus is laid out, fraternities and sororities are on the South side of campus and all of the dormitories are on the North. Whether this was done on purpose or coincidentally, I'm not entirely sure. I don't mind the ten*ish* minute walk over because I love spending time with my girlfriend and it was only a short few weeks before we would be parting for summer soonbut this particular time, the walk was much different. Obviously the same stroll I've taken hundreds of times, yet there was a stark contrast in comparison to the previous times I'd done it.

It was roughly 9:30 PM, so it was far past sundown even at this time of the year (early May). The weather was normal. Well, as normal as it could be in Nebraska. The only thing worth noting was that it was windyenough to notice but not enough to impair your hearing or anything. Again, it was typical for me to walk over around night time because we both had a heavy course load this semester and found we distracted each other too much whilst trying to study or do homework. With this being said, we mostly spent time together when we had finished our school work for the day. Personally I didn't mind being distracted from the dreadful graphs of Macroeconomics or the repetition of filling out Accounting balance sheets, but she's much more academically sound and *put-together* than I am so I respected her wishes by separating our studies and time spent together.

A side note; Ive always been weird about counting stuff out in my head. I feel like it keeps me distracted in boring or monotonous situations like a stroll across campus. So it wasn't until about three minutes into my walk that I noticed something strange. There was virtually *no one* besides myself on this particular side of campus which was not a normal occurrence by any means. Especially around finals week, I would have expected to see at least a handful of people walking to or from the testing center or their go-to study spots. However, to my own dismay, the streets and sidewalks were desolate. Not a car nor another soul in sight.

As I continued on my walk, I couldnt help but get a shiver down my spine around what I guessed was the sixth minute. You know that feeling you get in the back of your head when you feel like youre being watched? *Thats all I could think about*. Clich, I know, but I couldnt shake the feeling. Of course, I scanned my surroundings like any sentient being would, but there was nobody in the vicinity of 32nd street. At least thats what I thought at the time.

I noticed my pace had subconsciously began to speed up, probably done reflexively after I couldnt shake the paranoia. I swear I heard some tree branches rustle to the left of me, *probably just a damn squirrel*which wasnt too bad of a guess honestly considering the substantial amount that inhabited the rather large campus. I wasnt going to let a damn squirrel get into my head so I braved forward. I counted how many steps it took me on average to get from one street corner to the next, for my own sanity ya know?

Although it seemed odd to methe empty streets, the rustling, the feeling that was haunting my psychethis wasnt what set me off. It was the clicking. It was a deep clicking, distant but close enough to pick apart from the wind. It was unlike *anything* I had ever heard before, and it only occurred every ten or so steps I took; like the noise somehow had to do with my pace. 

In fact, it was every ten steps. 

Letting the paranoia get to me, I would slow down and rapidly speed up my steps to see if the noise was a figment of my imagination or if it had to do with the electrical current of the wires overhead or whatever. *But it kept the same pace as my strides*. 

I knew then that something was amiss. I continued on my way, walking much faster than I ever have before. **click**. If anyone else were walking the streets, I probably would have looked like a lunatic examining every shadowy, nook and noise I heard.

It wasnt until I was at the corner of 33rd and Mapleadjacent to my girlfriends dorm, that I found the source of my paranoia. *It wasnt a squirrel*. Actually, it wasnt an animal at all. And it turns out my gut feeling was right. I *was* being watched, nonetheless followed. At first glance, I thought it was just some lowlife dude, walking on all fours like some sick fucking joke, shaking his head viciously. But it wasnt a dude either. It wasnt even a human at all. **click**.

Theres a certain feeling that overcomes your body when the fear youre dealing with outweighs any logical reasoning. Paranoia? It wasnt exactly that. Terror? Well pretty much, but only worse in this case. I was **completely mortified** and I hadnt seenor hearda fraction of the trepidity that was to come.

Words cannot explain the flushness of conscience or complete disbelief I felt when I met eyesor lack thereofwith this... thing. **click**. 

**It had no eyes**, yet wrinkles of bags nonetheless. Just empty sockets where I assumed they once were. The only thing I could bring myself to think was what the fuck. Im not kidding at all when I say this thing could have been the capstone of a Blumhouse horror movie. **click**. 

Its thick layer of rotting skin was pulled tightly against its endoskeleton revealing every bone in the creatures body. It had a human-like build: ribcage, shoulder blades, kneecaps, a skull very similar to our own; the whole nine yardsbut this thing wasnt human at all. 

It had no nose, no ear cartilagejust canalsno real mouth, yet it had some sort of slits around the area where any mouth would be. Like it's upper and lower lips were sewed together by some unearthly material.

It was completely hairless and was deprived of any true muscular build, yet it seemed much stronger than I upon further examination of its definition. On top of that, it was drained of any and all color of the skin from what I could tell in the dark. It looked lifeless yet full of vivacity. Its arms and legs were much longer than any humans I've seen and it's fingers bent four times from knuckles until reaching its talon-like claws. I looked down at my own fingers, they only bent twice. **click**. 

I stood there, motionless, staring directly into the soul of this creature as it did to me. I wanted to run and scream and believe me *I tried*, but I couldnt get myself to move. Its almost like his eyeless gaze kept me in a trance. I realized later that as long as he was looking at meor into me with how deep of a stare it feltI had no control over my own body. No reflexes, motor movements, nothing. It was inside of my head, *making* me stand there like a fucking fool. **click**.

Time stood completely still. It almost felt as if it were studying every feeling Ive ever had, diving into every corner of my psyche and digging up the most revealing parts of my own mind. The secrets, my fears, the guilt Ive feltall of it. And in that moment, I was completely vulnerable. *Its like it already knew who I was*. 

I could feel the warm reclusion of tears run down my cheeks. I was never one to cry, especially outside of my comfort zone. That's when I knew this thing was far beyond any evil that any movie or TV show has tried to recreate. This was a living nightmare, a build-up of every terrible emotion or incident I've repressed that was now coming back to haunt me. Blumhouse movies seemed like fairy tales compared to the true horror standing only a hundred feet in front of me.

Rocks kicked up from the pavement in the distance as a car approached. I knew I needed some type of serious distraction if I ever wanted to get away from this fucking thing. Before I could even turn to see the vehicle, the creature gave another **click** and sporadically looked one way and the other, as if he was searching for something. But what?

Without any forewarning it dashed to the corner of the street faster than Ive *ever* seen any animal or human run with my own eyes and mind you*the thing was on all fours*like some fucking animal, but like I said before, it wasnt an animal, it was like the very core of fear itself. It was a goddamned demon. It had to have been. It turned to face me, **clicked** once more and slid menacingly into the nearest storm drain. 

**The fucking storm drain**

This was after a rather fear-imposing, devilish smile through its colorless slits of a mouth. I wish that was it, but before it had retreated into the drain it spun its head 180 on its axis, staring directly at me with an upside down face. Although there was a fair amount of distance between the thing and I, it sounded as if it were whispering its rank breath into my ear See you soon, my dear friend. Darkness flushed over my sight and I saw complete nothingness. I heard the vehicle pass and it was then that I snapped out of my trance. 

And for the first time that night, I was *actually* alone on the street. I ran the rest of the way to my girlfriends dorm. It was the only thing my body would let me do when I finally had control of it again. I had no access to get in so I started pounding on the front doors in fear that it would find its way back to me. The people at the lobby reluctantly opened the doors for me; probably hoping for some sort of explanation for my frantic behavior but I didn't give a fuck at that point. 

I darted straight past the front desk and toward the stairs and up to my girlfriend's dorm. I told her everything from start to finish, but honestly I dont think she believed me. It hurts to feel things so real and justify them as best as you can, but to not have them be heard. I had to let someone know, someone who would believe everything that I saw and felt; I had to post the story here.

I have gotten basically no sleep the past week and I have finals coming up very soon. For the few hours I do sleep, the thing is there in my dreams. It takes over my dreams and turns them into nightmares; every time it shows up, it's closer than it was in the last. I just don't know what's going to happen when it finally reaches me. If I try to run away in my dream, I wake back upit's like I have no way to escape. 

Last night when I woke abruptly from yet another nightmare, I swear I saw it for a split second through my window. 

I live on the third floor of my fraternity house. It doesn't make sense that I could have seen it, but when you're scared shitless, even the most implausible things become believable.

Earlier today I noticed something extremely unsettlingpossibly the worst part of it all: there's a storm drain directly in front of my house. *How fucking long has this thing been following me? And why is it only interested in me?* There has to be something more. I'll keep you guys all posted, but this is as much as I can write for now. ~

UPDATE: I dug deeper into my sleeping problems and seeing it when I woke up. There are scratch marks up the side of my house leading directly to my window on the third floor. They were from claws. Its been watching me sleep. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Purchased the beaut last night and only have one complaintthere is no customization available for it whatsoever. While I understand their purpose of keeping it natural for Bruce's sake and the movie, it's a huge disappointment to have BMD's and Painted wheels but not being able to put them into the car. Toppers and trails nonetheless. (Although I can't complain about the trail because quite frankly, it's authentically fitting)

Is this an implausible request? Or is there any possibility of seeing a change in the future? Can you imagine heatwave/20XX/hexed on the bat mobile? It would be absolutely stunning. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Add me on Xbox. GT is Zorbs 1017. Was rising star in 3s last season and currently Platinum 1 in solo duel so I can fend for myself quite well. Looking for a solid doubles partner because I solo queued my way to Gold 1 Div 3 and need someone to communicate with to climb the ranks. My rank in 2s doesn't justify where I really should be and I can prove it to you if you give me the chance.

Mechanical strengths are aerials, dribbling on-ground and wall aerials/passes. (Working on my air dribbles, only landed a few thus far) Pretty solid on defense but prefer mid to front fieldI can adjust to any position though as I'd like to consider myself a well rounded player.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have my air roll bound to my left analog stick on Xbox One controller. Took a while to get used to, but now that I have it down I can rotate my car and angle it the way I want the ball to hit it simultaneously.

If you're looking to improve on aerials/walls/redirects I personally would recommend giving it a shot! It's helped me improve on my mechanical skills tremendously. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have mine bound to my left analog stick so while I'm rotating my car I can also control the angle where I want the ball to hit. It's like having double control with just one buttonS

It's helped me soooo soooo much and since I've learned it I can't myself to bind it to any other key. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're rotating, getting clears and making saves, you're getting just as many if not more points as someone always ball chasing and taking shots. A save is 30 points and a clear is 20, on top of 10 for an aerial hits you get for saves and whatnot. That gives you tons of opportunity to score points even as a backline/support player. 

People who ball chase will obviously get points for taking shots and hopefully making them if they're not too toxic. Just saying your philosophy isn't as one way as you may think it is </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like it's due to being a recipe for some sort of disasterimplemented to stop the changes of finding glitches and bugs with the trading system and whatnot.

Obviously if you're split-screening you know the person you're with very well (arguably), and thus you would be able to trust them and try new things and from an outside perspective it just seems a little sketchy even if you truly do have good intentions.

I too have questioned but then thought about it from Psyonix's viewpoint and it makes more sense. Hope this helps or maybe I'm just ranting but either way have a good day :)  </TEXT>

I'm Platinum 1 Div 3 currently in 1s so it's not like I can't carry or fend for myself but it says something when I can't get out of the silver ranks on solo standard. It's cliche to say but right nowI say now because hopefully the monstrosity will be tweaked or solve itselfyou pretty much have to carry and hope you hit a streak to get that MMR up.

Keep grinding bro cause we're all in the same boat lol. Good looks and good luck from one struggling solo queuer to another </TEXT>

My biggest piece of advice would be to utilize the air roll key binding. It's truly a life saver.
