<TEXT> It depends on where you go. I had a pretty good experience at the first one I went to, it was frequented by people in law enforcement and a couple of the instructors were state police. They routinely practiced grappling maneuvers, weapon retention and disarming people. I stayed at that one for about a year. 

The second place I went to wasn't too great they mostly did bag work and never went into anything that was remotely complex.

I've seen videos of places that are pretty amazing in that they appear to almost be prepping their students for extended urban combat but I've never been to one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been a hobbyist for a little over a year now, approaching two years I think. I don't get out to take pictures as often as I'd like but I should be able to keep up with this class.

This is my current favorite picture, took it when I was fooling around with a super cheap lens. I like how the gazebo looks distinct from everything else in the picture. I would like to go back and adjust the lens flare in the bottom left corner though - https://imgur.com/gallery/aJWIZ

I wish this one had turned out better but I was rushed and freezing - https://imgur.com/gallery/IFm09

I'm not really sure what I love but I do enjoy walking around, relaxing and taking photos around cities when it's not busy (at night).

If you're going to take the time to argue with people you should at least know what the argument is. After that, maybe think about some better examples(drunk driving is more akin to murder, which is already illegal, than simply owning a gun)and try a tactic different than "if you don't agree with my opinon on this issue then you must not care about these people."

<TEXT> Haha, I'm sure they would like to but it doesn't really make sense for police to use them as regular patrol vehicles for a few reasons which I can maybe reason out because I spent a few years as military police.

1. You're supposed to be licensed to drive those vehicles (at least in the military). It doesn't make sense to waste the time and money on an officer just so they can cruise around in a vehicle they don't need. 

2. Those vehicles can be difficult to maneuver in civilian traffic. They have major blind spots, the turning radius can be horrible, you also may not even realize it if you cause minor damage to property or injure someone. Don't even start on parking.

3. They require specialized repair. I don't think Bubba's garage is certified to repair those vehicles so again it's going to cost time and money to do even minor repairs. They probably aren't even capable of doing a tire change locally. 

The only time I ever used those vehicles in a stateside mission (not training) was to guard a downed tank from a training accident and to guard checkpoints in the time shortly after 9/11 and we had the capability to repair easily and most everyone was licensed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  How do you think she could have got that psychiatric help? As a minor under control by her parents, who were making her go to Christian anti-trans counseling.

It's not very complicated: 

You call 911 and tell them that you're going to kill yourself. They take you to a hospital, not an anti-trans counselor. You talk to the psychiatric representative in the ER and tell him/her that you have a plan and you're going to follow through with it. They probably admit you and your parents can't do anything about it because that's not how it works.

 So when you're judging Leelah as a dick for her suicide method, you're really judging her as a dick for suiciding at all.

Well, I think I'm judging her on both but my main problem is that she was so selfish and unthinking as to make another person take her life, which seems worse than someone just finding the body. You know that being a trans teenager doesn't make you beyond reproach, right? </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's weird, because he didn't address any of the points and instead used sort of an ad hominem to discredit the other guy. Not exactly what I would consider intelligent, even in this thread. Why don't you just say that you were looking ~~with~~ for someone who agreed with you? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You may have experienced different things and be completely new in terms of cell makeup but there is continuity between the old you and the new you. 

If "you" cease to exist and then something with the same genetic structure is created a few kalpa later, it won't be you. It won't have your experiences. If by some magical coincidence it has the same genetic structure and all the same experiences as you it won't matter because there is no continuity.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm just an incredibly shitty novice but some tips would be:

Use a tripod

Use a very low shutterspeed/bulb mode

Get a lens with a low aperture number like f2.8 or lower (I've taken some decent pictures with just f3.5)

Oh and one of those remotes for your camera so you don't actually have to press the button (I don't own one so I can't tell you much about it)

Learn a little bit about iso, aperture and shutterspeed then experiment.
