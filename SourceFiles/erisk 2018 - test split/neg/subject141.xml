<TEXT> I understand that money is not important to you but may be he is taking the situation in another way. After he came to know that you own so much money, he decided to immerse himself in work because may be he is thinking that in future he should not prove himself as a good for nothing and live depending on you. Remember, career wise, once time gone, wont come back again. So, I think his decision is not bad..let him do what he wish. Talk to him. respect his thoughts. I just suggest, be with him. </TEXT>
