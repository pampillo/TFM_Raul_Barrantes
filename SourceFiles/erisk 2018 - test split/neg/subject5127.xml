<TEXT> That's basically how I understand it for the class being engaging part. The students liking each other part seems a little different. Students were more likely to sync up if they reported liking each other, but only if they'd talked with each other before class. This suggests that face-to-face social connection plays a role too.  </TEXT>

Are things improving with time or getting worse?

<TEXT> What do you make of [recent research](https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/antibiotics-given-early-in-life-may-have-lasting-negative-effects) suggesting that antibiotics early in childhood might have lasting negative effects on things like brain development, gut microbes, and social behavior? This seems very preliminary (I think just documented in mice so far), but still very troubling.

I know you specialize more in viruses and vaccines, but this seems very reminiscent of concerns about vaccines.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I gather that teaching to tests is awful for kids, I wonder if teachers get away with this less now with all the standardized testing. 

Had the same thing in Ancient and Medieval History in 9th grade. The teacher had Greek heritage. It started out normal: a unit on Mesopotamia, one on Egypt, one on the Hebrews. Then came an Athens unit. Then a Sparta unit. Then a separate unit on the Peloponnesian War. Then a handful of other Greece units. Never got to Rome. Definitely never got to the medieval part.

On the other hand, he was a great teacher in other respects. Learned a ton about the process of doing history, which is in retrospect probably more important anyway than what we actually studied.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> US education varies a lot from state to state, and from teacher to teacher. In my experience, WWI and WWII were on the curriculum. But because we went through things roughly chronologically, we never actually got to them due to bad time management by teachers.

Had a whole year of "Modern European History," but we never made it much past the industrial revolution. Had a day each for WWI and WWII at the end of the year.  </TEXT>
