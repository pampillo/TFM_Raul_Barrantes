<TEXT> I'm used to being followed. Since I moved here, the neighbors in my apartment have been relentless. They have a problem with me because of my skin color.

It isn't an assumption. 

I'm one of two white people living in this building on East 89th. The other is the landlord, an old Jewish lady that everyone leaves alone for obvious reasons. In the past two months I've been called "punk-ass white boy" and "little cracker bitch" more times than Hillary lied to Congress. 

I've never been hurt, luckily. Well, for awhile at least. The "tough" guys around here only ever followed me. Intimidation seems to be their game with an end goal of getting me to move out. Well, it used to be that way. 

In my hometown we didn't have any alternative meanings for May Day. It was simply a day of remembrance of the labor strikes - that's it. I learned *very* quickly that Cleveland operates on a different dictionary.

It was six in the morning that Monday when I stepped outside to start my morning jog. I couldn't have been stretching for more than a couple of minutes when I heard an all too familiar voice from behind me.

"The fuck your lil bitch ass going?"

It was Jamal. He was the most aggressive and intimidating of the thugs on my floor. Jamal was a *massive* black man who towered over me by at least a foot and a half, and could easily have fit three of me inside of him. He had a thing for making me flinch. 

"Come on, man. I'm just trying to go for a run. C-can you just cut me some slack today?" I couldn't hide my nervousness.

Jamal was silent for a moment, as if he was almost confused by me asking. "It's May Day, my dude. And yo ass is the only cracker living in the hood."

Before I had time to ask, a couple of his friends joined him by his side like panthers ready to pounce. 

"You got a five second head start then we're gonna fuck yo punk ass up." He held up an open palm and began counting down. I took off as fast as I could, hoping that five seconds would give me enough time to outrun the skyscraper that was Jamal and his friends. I must have made it a hundred feet before I felt the hands shove me to the pavement.

I don't know what time it was when I came to. Only that the sun had finally come up and I was laying behind an old Toyota on bricks in an alley. My body was screaming at me - angry with me for not running faster and causing myself so much pain. I felt my pockets and my phone was gone. They didn't take my cash, which I guess was nice of them all things considered. 

I scanned the pavement for any blood or signs of my phone when a pair of eyes met mine. I rubbed my own to be sure what I was seeing was actually there. The eyes were intense. Squinting. Almost as if they were scolding me for what I allowed to happen to myself. They were a bold jade color that wasn't afraid of holding back any emotions. I never wanted to have a concussion so badly before. It was the only way to explain my shadow looking back at me. 

After a standoff of gazes I began to test my shadow. When I moved, it moved. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary there. I walked into the shadows, however, and it didn't go away. My shadow was bold, and it's eyes were even more intense. It never broke it's visual lock on me. 

I tried to convince myself that I was hallucinating. "I've just been jumped," I told myself, "that's all it is. I need a doctor." 

Upon my uttering of those words, my shadow became irate. It's eyes widened and began thrusting it's pupils in one direction. Then back to me. Then in the same direction. It appeared that it wanted me to go somewhere. I refused at first, obviously. Something about the pain and anger in the look in it's eyes worked me, though. I began to follow the path it was making. 

As we walked, those green eyes never let me out of their site except to point in a new direction. I considered trying to run away before it dawned on me that I couldn't escape my shadow. Block after block, the journey seemed pointless until we came up to the stoop of a decrepit house with boards on all of the first floor windows and graffiti on what was left of the aluminum siding. My shadow stated straight ahead as I stood at the foot of the steps. It was unrelenting. I knew it wanted me to go in, and so I did.

I heard a deep voice laugh as I climbed in through a loose board covering a window. "Well look at this shit, brothers. This lil white dude thinks he's a baller now." Jamal and his friends walked right up to me, ready to finish the job they started this morning. I started to back away until a piercing sound of some sort of animal crying out in pain brought me to my feet. Everything started becoming blurry and my head burned as if it was being torn open from the inside out. I tried reaching out for something to grasp and fell onto my stomach. That's when I saw the bright white eyes on my shadow looming over my pitiful body. 

I woke up in my bed in my pajamas, freshly showered and well-rested. It was dark outside. I couldn't find my phone still, so I turned on the tv to catch the time on the news or weather channel. 

*Breaking News for you tonight here in Cleveland. I'm Tiffani Tucker, Chris Tanaka is off for the evening. Four bodies were just discovered in an abandoned house in East Cleveland. The were brutally murdered in what Police Chief Calvin Williams is calling "..one of the worst murders he's seen in his entire career." We do not have an official statement from the police as to why these men were attacked, but our sources say the home in which the bodies were found is in fact a known drug house. We'll keep you updated as we learn more information.*

My heart tried escaping. I scanned the room looking for anything. Something telling me my life was a dream. Sweat began pushing its way out of my pores. Did I do that? I couldn't remember attacking anyone. I couldn't have. As I was lost in my frantic thoughts, I saw the familiar green eyes on the wall next to me. 

"You're welcome." A deep, distorted voice said from the same direction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It boils down to preference, honestly.

On one hand, it would be easier to build a following if every thing is under one name. On the other, you can add to immersion by using other accounts.

As far as real name vs. pen name, it just depends on what feels good to you. I use a pen name because my real name is hard enough to pronounce, let alone try to sell books with. 

Do what feels right! </TEXT>

<TEXT> From day one, I knew my boy was gonna be special. When we had got home from the hospital he done reaffirmed my beliefs. Like a true parasite, he ate the host he came from. Left a few bones but I ain't never been one to complain. Plus, she was more than enough to fatten him up and keep him occupied fer a while. 

Ya see, newborns need to be loaded up on nutrients. Alla them carbohydrits and such. Well, the doctor told me that at least. Said something about his arms and legs need the energy to "distend" or something like that. I don't know. I like how he's been crawling around all cute like. 

Wasn't really ever a problem with my boy until he got a bit hungry. He started to eat my kitty cats and I gotta be honest, it rightfully pissed me off. I yelled at him and he hid under the couch for a couple of days. I was so mad, I didn't even bother looking til early this morning. 

Boy, I wish I would have looked sooner.

Damn boy wrecked my whole couch! There's a bunch of fuckin sticky strings and spit under there like a goddamn tent! Upholstery ain't cheap! When I saw that I lost my cool temper. I shook the couch hard as I could muster. Grabbed it by one arm and tried lift in it up to scare him out. Jumped on it. Kicked it. Sprayed it with febreeze. 

Til I heard a light screech that made me dizzy. I looked under and I cracked his little hiding spot open. It's got a pretty purple light coming out of it. It's so pretty in fact that I ain't even mad no more. I might even go find him something to nibble on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I drink coffee to get through my day. Like those who drink alcohol to get through lonely nights. The main differences between myself and an alcoholic are as follows:

I drink coffee to hear voices. 

They drink beer to stop them.

I'm aware it's a broad assumption that people drink to stop voices. Does your brain not create monologue for every thing you do? Those poor decisions can be drowned with the right cocktail blend. 

I can't hear them. I wake up without motivation. Caffeine boosts my adrenaline. Kicking my ass, saying:

"Keep running."

They won't find me before 17. </TEXT>

**Title:** I'm open to suggestions

---

I've never quite understood why people feel the need to crowd around someone after an incident. They don't know the victim and typically don't even care about their well-being. Is it bragging rights? Being able to say you were there when that beautiful, young woman fell two stories from a balcony to the pavement must qualify people for a higher status quo, I guess.

I was across the street sitting on the patio at Starbucks when the commotion began. An older gentleman began shouting for help as he ran to the side of a motionless blonde woman who was trying to dye her hair red. On cue, the ants began trickling in to capture any piece of the sweetness that they could. 

"She must have fallen right off!" The old man exclaimed as he wheezed, out of breath from the excitement. 

I glanced up at the balcony. It was void of the vultures that typically stare from above when someone "falls." I took a sip of my decaf and went back to the article on my phone. 

"Suicide." I murmured to myself with a chuckle, " Horrible height to do it from. Completely inefficient." 

"Are you a fucking *asshole* or something?" A woman berated, slamming her hand down on the table in front of me. 

"I'm just saying it isn't an effective way to get the job done." I shrugged and looked at the scene. "See, she's already moving again." 

The woman smacked my coffee to the ground and marched off, presumably to go uphold justice somewhere she could be more successful. After assessing the damage to my loafers, I glanced again to the crowd that was paralyzed by discombobulation. The blonde was standing and brushing herself off. I couldn't make out her words but it appeared she was letting them know she was okay. Our eyes met.

She immediately abandoned her entourage, casually strolling towards me. When she got to the sidewalk outside of the patio barricade my heart fluttered. Despite being in the middle of a poor dye job, she was the most elegant creature I had ever seen.

"Hey. So I'm having a really rough day. Do you want to go get beers or something?" Her voice was soothing in ways I can't begin to explain.

"Absolutely." I couldn't say no to those legs.     </TEXT>

It was a peculiar request. Harold had a mobile phone, a swell car, and it was a particularly bad day for public transport with the rain. Still, Emma obliged as a good secretary does.

"You let him go!? Why!? How long ago did he leave?" Harold's wife was frantic. That morning, she had discovered his manuscript on the desktop. She knew he was a writer. She also knew this wasn't one of his stories.

<TEXT> You stopped coming around. Why? Are you still holding a grudge against me for eating your dog?

Come on, man. Don't be petty.

We both know it was a clean kill. You laid him down on top of the altar and we both held the handle as it pierced his neck. Exactly as the book instructed. It wasn't my fault you decided to burn the body. Cooked meat is cooked meat.

You used to visit me. Twice a week more regularly than an old man on a prune diet. Is one meal really enough to stop a bond like ours?

It was *him* wasn't it? 

Did he visit you, too? Leaning in doorways. Sitting in the good chair. Casually murmuring under his breath how you need to act first. You always had to be first. Well, I won't be last. I'm coming for you. 

It worked, and I'm back. I'm not going to kill you back - that would be petty. I want to become you. Occupy your mind and ruin your life. Then you can kill us both next time. </TEXT>

You can file a DMCA claim against the offending YouTube channel. They're quite responsive and helpful in these situations. My issues were resolved in less than a few days. 

As far as stopping it, it'll never happen. Even if you never published works online and only stuck to print publishing someone, somewhere will read your book and steal the idea. Erasing your nosleep catalog isn't the way to go. It's a headache, but fortunately these things can easily be dealt with once discovered. No worries! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely. Actually, I almost posted a similar thread last night about how American horror specifically is trite these days.

Like, I still get scared - don't get me wrong. It takes *a lot* to get me there, though. I'm in the same boat as Elias. Video games are generally the only thing that can truly set me off. It's something about being immersed into a world where you're in control and those things are, in a way, happening directly to you. 

Also, horror in non-American cultures is way better. Side note.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on how long you've been gone. I'd recommend sorting through top posts. A lot of the all time posts have changed in the last six months due to new writers and the new upvote algorithm. 

Off the top of my head..

/u/Hayong is new and a lovely contributor.

/u/iia, of course.

/u/A10A10A10A10 has earned a spot in my heart, even though I have zero clue if the user name is spelled that way.

There's also the *Dared My Best Friend* series by /u/Harrison_Prince.

Um.

Infected Town **finally** finished up.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It started with a razor blade. The stereotypical stainless-steel trapezoid that only rusts if you let the blood sit too long. I stole it from my father's workshop. 

My father picked me up from school that day after the principal called to inform him of my "grandiose hysterical behavior" - I believe that was the exact quote. I was inconsolable. A wreck. A hot mess. A twelve year old who shouldn't have been carrying the emotional burden that I was. When he came into the principal's office it became clear to me that I was alone. Mrs. Rollins, for being a rather voluptuous black woman in an all white town, should have had some empathy. The townsfolk didn't want a "nigger" there just like the girls in my class didn't want...me...learning alongside them.

"Mr. Halls, your daughter has been causing an *excessive* disturbance lately. Do you have any idea what has gotten into her?" Rollins quickly blurted out, as if she was afraid her cholesterol was finally catching up with her.

"David." He replied.

"I'm sorry?"

"Name's David. Mr. Halls is some guy in Ohio that I've never met." My dad shot me a sly wink as he frowned to try hiding his grin.

"*Mr. Halls.* Ellie has been disrupting her class almost daily since sessions began this term." She stood up and threw her hands down on her desk. "Do *you* know what's going on with her?"

My father, a calm man by nature, stood straight up and slammed his hands onto Mrs. Rollins desk, mimicking her. 

"No." He said softly. That was the first time I laughed since school started.

"This is not a joke!" Rollins erupted, and my father stopped hiding his smile. 

"You're right, Donna. It isn't. My wife and I are paying you nine-*thousand* dollars a year for our daughter to attend this school. Do you know why we pay that, Donna?" His cheeriness began to fade. "We're paying that so Ellie here can get a good education at a good school around good people so she can grow up and have a good life. Are you following my theme here?" 

She nodded and returned to her chair.

"Good. We don't pay you nine-*thousand* dollars for our daughter to come home every single day in tears because some snotty little bitches hate that she eats more than a carrot stick for dinner."

"It is **not** appropriate to talk about children that way!" She popped up and slammed her hands onto her desk again, this time knocking over a pile of papers.

"You're right," my dad sat down and crossed his arms, "it isn't. No one should be talking about any child that way. Why do these girls get to call my daughter fat, Mrs. Rollins?"

I can't recall much of the meeting after that. I think hearing my father, my hero, acknowledging that I had a weight problem made me suppress the rest. That's what my therapist said, at least.

The clearest memory I have after that meeting is stealing the blade from dad's yellow toolkit while I sat in his shop waiting for him to finish a desk. He had so many that I was confident he would have no idea he was missing it. We went home that evening and my mother had dinner ready for us. Meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and carrots. I ran to my room in a fluster of "grandiose hysterical behavior." No one followed.

I expected the first cut to hurt. My hands were shaking as I tried to hold the blade steady while my insides seeped out from behind it. The second cut came with greater ease. Whether that was from the loss of blood or the willingness to die I can't say. I wanted to keep going until the end, but as foolish as it was, I freaked out when the blood starting pooling on the carpet. My mother would kill me for leaving a stain in her house. I wanted sympathy...someone to care. Not chastise me. I stopped. The blood didn't. 

I panicked and shouted for help as loud as I possibly could. I didn't realize how unprepared I was to die. 

Mr. McKinney was the nicest person I think I have ever met in my life. He wasn't like any of my teachers, bosses, or *typical* therapists. For five years on Tuesdays and Fridays I *mattered.* McKinney understood me and my struggles. In fact, he was like me. He was made fun of in school because no one wanted him there. Girls didn't breathe in his direction and boys spared no expense reminding him of what he was. That's why he became a therapist - to help kids who were dealing with what he what went through. I loved that man. I always will. 

On my first visit after turning seventeen we experimented with a new form of therapy that McKinney created. The first step was hypnosis. Not put-you-in-a-trance style, but rather a light, drug induced state of lucidity. While in this calm state, he would attempt physical stimulation to manifest activity in my dream state. For the first few sessions, he would perform various pokes and rubs on my feet to see if I would make myself run while lucid. We then moved onto my thighs, where he would tickle the insides with his fingers to make me kick. He'd massage my shoulders and kiss my neck to get me to look in a particular direction. Mr. McKinney would fuck me because he was a monster. I loved every second of it. We had a real connection, and to this day he's truly the only man besides my father that I loved. 

My second attempt was not long after I told my parents about the relationship Mr. McKinney and I were having. I pleaded and pleaded with them not to do anything. "We're in love!" was my stump phrase when they would use their word for us. I tried explaining that I wanted it. I wanted him. Rape is only rape if it wasn't consensual. 

It didn't matter.

Within a short month of being arrested, McKinney lost his office and his entire career. As we were waiting in the courtroom for the first of many trials to begin my father collapsed onto the cold, marble floors. Dead on arrival. There was no hope for resuscitation, according to the paramedics. It didn't stop me from trying CPR until I had to be physically restrained. 

The hospital held me overnight due to my "grandiose hysterical behavior." I believe the official listing for my stay was due to a mental breakdown which, looking back on things now, was a horribly mild diagnosis considering my mental state. After my nurse left my mother and I with discharge papers, I ripped the pen from my mom's hand and shoved in into my neck as far as I could until my world went white.

I didn't see anything for those two minutes of being legally deceased. I only heard a voice - a child's voice. He told me his name was Jonah and that we were best friends now. Jonah said he would help me get through the hard times. 

Jonah wasn't real, as far as I know. Five years after we first met, I'm now quite confident of that. He was a figment of my imagination that manifested itself during a time of peak stress. He did, however, give me the confidence to make it through my last year of school after my father died. 

My second round of senior year started in September, a couple weeks after the rest of the kids started. My new therapist believed that all of the hustle and bustle of kids getting acclimated to their classes would be too stressful for me. I also had to have my teachers sign off that I attended every class, and then turn my sheet into the principal's office at the end of each day where my mother would meet me and take me home. I was a prisoner living under a disguise they called freedom. 

My grand return to school started with homeroom, where all of my life-long "friends" also happened to be. A failed subtle attempt at keeping tabs on me. They could have at least found actual friends of mine. Instead, the class was filled with boys only looked at me like a freak and girls who moved on from making fun of my appearance to reminding me of how I killed my dad by being a whore. 

I didn't make it to my next class. 

Jonah came to me while I was sleeping that night. He wiped my tears and handed me a slip of paper - the address of one Isabella DeSantis, also known as the girl who lead the bitches that made me how I was. Jonah told me how we could handle it. I disagreed, but he was just as persuasive as he was persistent.

Together, Jonah and I walked to her house. I slid in through a window and he followed close behind. We explored the house until we found her bedroom, all white with stupid gold decorations. She was a diva, alright. As I stood over her, looking down at the source of my years of self-hatred I lost my confidence. I wept and backed away. I couldn't go through with it. Jonah became angry at my flaking. He took the razor blade from my hand and slit both of her wrists while holding his hand over her mouth. She only struggled for a couple of minutes, thankfully. I went home with Jonah and he held me while I slept soundly for the first time in years.

I haven't seen Jonah since I fell asleep that night, but I know he's still watching me. This morning I found an address and a date in my planner. The release date of Jim McKinney, and the return of my best friend. 

10/18/17. 

I'll see you soon.

<TEXT> My biggest piece of advice would be to work on fluidity. A lot of your adjective heavy sentences come across almost list like, as if you're just retelling bullet points from your notes. That also applies to the action in your story. It just has a stoic, list feeling to it.

Instead of listing, you could try adding in descriptions to action. Or coattailing descriptions onto other sentences. 

*We walked down the tunnel. It was dark and damp, with noises that would unsettle most.*

<TEXT> First off, I appreciate how you're handling this thread. I definitely thought you were going to come across as unnecessarily hostile about the subject. Thank you for not :)

To answer your question, I tend to write a decent amount of stories based on people being disturbed. Paranormal just isn't my thing (for writing - fucking love ghost stuff). If I were to exclude anyone on the LBGTQ spectrum solely for being under it, why would I not exclude heterosexual people as well? I would essentially be labeling straight people as the only ones who can be mentally disturbed. That just isn't fair. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm...a grin that is far too wide? Perhaps with too many teeth...? I'm not familiar. Maybe /u/vainercupidOOC could help me out with that one.

In all seriousness though, tropes are hard to avoid. To be ~~ab~~original these days is almost impossible. Writing is essentially just taking a common trope and refreshing it with a new spin. Unfortunately, not every one can make it work and you'll tend to notice it a lot more because of that. When done well, you'd have no idea.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You said "shit" thirteen times in five paragraphs. I'm not sure if I want to yell at you or shake your hand for that.

So, as for your question, you definitely should look into fleshing this out a bit. The claustrophobic aspect of being stuck in the sewer while his suit fills could use a lot more detail. Also, maybe some more backstory as to how or why he can change bodies when he dies. You can definitely add some strong paranormal elements to this with that. I won't suggest any more endings because I think cymoril hit that perfectly. You could possibly frame this from the get-go about how he hates his *current* life and wants a new one. Idk. This is good though! 

In short, you've got a strong skeleton that just needs some flesh and scary shit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's the narrative. I like the style and I get why it was written that way. However, it isn't really a *story* and it doesn't do much to draw people into it. With r/nosleep readers, they typically like a story being told to them as opposed to a person talking out loud to someone. Actually, as I wrote that I found a better way to say it. 

So, this is a very creepy almost journal-style piece. However, most people expect a story and it probably fell flat with the wrong readers. It's still good! I wouldn't let the downvotes bother you. You pushed the envelope and it didn't get received well, that's all it is. 

Keep up the good work! </TEXT>

<TEXT> You make some great points! Now I'm going to make other ones:

#Series

Visibility - Significantly higher due to frequency of being on the front page (assuming upvotes) and retroactive reading.

Length - Series entries actually tend to be shorter, which people love because they don't want to read long stories. It sucks to hear, but it's true. If you hover between 500-1000 words, you'll have better odds than a 17,000 word epic. However, we live in an age of instant gratification. People don't necessarily want to wait out a series for a conclusion. They want a one and done deal.

#Long Ass-Story (there's an xckd about this joke)

Visibility - Unless you break the earth like /u/Elias_Witherow did with the *Feed the Pig* epic, you only have one solid shot of getting the upvotes you need to get serious visibility. That opening better be damn good, luck better be on your side, and you better have bribed /u/EtTuTortilla (Happy Birthday, buddy!!!) or you might miss your shot.

Length - People want a quick fix. Simple as that. There *are* long, super popular one-shot stories. Tons, even. However, I would wager that the majority of the top stories are either series or under...maybe 2,000 words? We live in an age of instant gratification. No one wants to put in effort, honestly.

**These are all my opinions. Nothing is fact. Nothing is real. We're all going to die. Time is just a manmade construct to confine us to mundane tasking to further the agenda of the few vs. the many. Hide the eggs.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, although the man himself implies that you need to have discipline in order to be great, I completely disagree. 

I don't actually understand the logic of forcing myself to write when I don't want to or don't have an ideas to write about. An old film professor of mine quoted someone who said (not verbatim) "just sit at a typewriter every day and write 500 words." That was supposed to be the trick, so to speak. Why would I do that? I *love* writing. If I'm forcing myself to do it then that means I'm not doing it because I love it, I'm doing it because I have to. For me, when an idea comes I'll run with it until I can't anymore. For a while that was almost every single day. Sometimes it'll be a week or two before I get inspired by an idea. 

I guess I'm saying that for me, I write when I have something to write about. I don't write to find something to write about. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, 50k words will certainly exceed the limit Reddit has as a site. There's a 40k cap on *characters* meaning if you top that with words already it won't work. 

Next, 50k words is a shorter novel. A novella is typically less than that. Maybe between 10k and 30k (don't quote me on those figures).

My advice? Add more to it and make it a novel. You're already in that range. Flush it out a bit more, get upwards of like 60-70k, and consider an editor and publishing. I can think of at least one company who would be willing to check out your story if you go the novel route. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes you just have to do it. Not try. Trying is for fools and failures. You have to *do.* 

*Do* follow your dreams.

*Do* get rid of those who wrong you.

*Do* be a good parent.

I stood there in silence, up against the communal bedroom wall of the orphanage at 1:07am, on March the 14th. His crib stayed in my sights for twenty-nine minutes as I contemplated an escape plan. For the first time in my life, I hadn't planned my actions ahead of time. 

I knew two things as I stood there watching my son sleep on those recycled animal-print sheets. The first was that I had found the right child. Black. Scar above his left eyebrow after my previous attempt at taking him. Nose like his mother's (before it was broken by a suitor during a late weekend at Denny's). The second fact? I wasn't leaving that orphanage without him. He was *my* son. *My* legacy. He belonged with *me.*

At 1:36am an attendant tip-toed into the nursery to check on the children. Beautiful woman. Probably in her mid-twenties. Brunette hair. A sexy green cami, stained with blood across the front of her...assets. I truly believed she didn't notice me molded into the wall. Dark in the dark, you know? Her scream as she checked on Noah convinced me otherwise. Such a waste of a beautiful soul. Noah cried heavily as I climbed down the ladder with him. A combination of the cold, March air and never being held by me before. 

Had I planned better, I would have expected the authorities to arrive at the orphanage six minutes after I killed the attendant. I would have also figured out that a scream and a loud thud in an orphanage housing a previously sought after infant would raise immediate attention. However, I didn't plan ahead. I let my emotions get the best of me and at 1:42am, the joint was surrounded by three cop cars housing five officers armed to the teeth. Had I planned better I would have not been hiding in a drain ditch trying to muffle an upset 188 day old baby.

When the adrenal glands kick in and pump out copious amounts of epinephrine into your blood stream, you make rash decisions. Looking back on it now, knocking out such a young child might not have been the best idea. I needed to work, however, and that required use of both of my hands. I swaddled Noah in my denim coat to keep him warm.

The first officer was easy.  At 1:51am, he was shining his Streamlight Stinger flashlight into a dumpster that he was leaning into. I cupped my hand over his mouth from behind and jammed the ice pick through his neck directly into his carotid artery. I must have gone deeper than intended, though, since I distinctly remember him bleeding from both sides as I shoved him into his proper home. 

1:53am. Officer Kline was a heavier set fellow. Probably still allowed on the force due to some sort of favor or tenure. He was leaning over a thin metal railing overlooking a dark stairwell when I gave him a light bump with my sole. Thirteen feet onto two concrete steps snapped his neck. It also produced a sound *just* audible enough for the remaining three officers to hone in the location of Officer Kline's incident. 

By 1:55am I was able to safely retrieve Noah and we made our leave on foot to my new apartment.  After all of this time. 186 days after his birth, 51 after my first attempt, I had secured my son. I *did it.*

I woke up from a dream that night. 4:04am. I was standing in the kitchen of my apartment eating a honey ham sandwich on Italian bread with fpur banana peppers and light yellow mustard when my son walked in. A bit unusual, but he was my boy after all.

"Dad," he said "there's someone at the door."

Curious, I walked over fourteen steps and opened it. He was right. A woman walked in, charred to a point where I barely recognized her. She blew me off, went right to Noah, and began playing with him. Noah wasn't afraid of her burnt skin. Uncaring of her broken leg and torn open breast. He was...*happy*...like I was when I killed that bitch for taking the heat in my apartment all of those years ago. He was...*me.*

I checked on Noah after I woke up and he was gone. No signs of struggle. No signs of pain. Just a pink post-it that read:

"You're not the Record Keeper." </TEXT>

"Let's keep going." The deputy interjected. "I don't know *what* the fuck that was, but I'm not tryin' to wait around here for it to come introduce itself."

"No!" I yelped as everyone turned to me. "No. He knows something." I pointed to Mr. Braam who was now bathing in sweat.

"I..well, you see...*Rudenhou-*" The light drained from his eyes before he could speak the name of the hospital. Braam fell to his knees, body lurched and punching the ground.  Every time he attempted to speak his back arched and his voice croaked in a wet heave.

"**RU**..den..*hou,*" Braam grunted between heaving. The sides of his hands were quickly covering themselves in blood as he continually hammered the sharp gravel looking for strength.

"**DRu**..."

Addy clasped my arm and buried her face into my back. "Look!" She whispered.

In my determination to hear an answer from Mr. Braam I hadn't noticed the woman lining the walls around us. Twelve of them, standing motionless in anatomical position as if we wouldn't see them if they didn't budge. Their eyes weren't observing the situation at hand, they were fixated on each other, admiring the battered flesh that shown between tattered clothes. No one else seemed to notice.

"**DRU**...denhouuussseeee.." Braam mustered up a full word just before a stream of milky white sludge poured from his mouth to the ground. The women lining the walls let out a simultaneous, piercing shriek that paralyzed us all in agony. I fell to the ground with Addy, blocking my ears with my palms. I could just make out the deputy in the same position, crawling by his elbows over to the side of the now unconscious Mr. Braam. Then it all stopped. Silence. 

"Hey, Jacob. You good?" The deputy tapped me on the shoulder. "You've been staring at that hole for an hour."

"Huh, yeah. I'm fine." I shook my head back to reality. "Excuse me, Mr. Braam?"

"Yes?" He responded cheerfully.

"Have you ever heard of the word 'Drudenhouse?'"

 ((My idea for this was that our protagonist was daydreaming, maybe a plant by a witch - not sure. Also, the spelling of drudenhouse is intentional, as we wouldn't know the proper spelling until Mr. Braam or someone was able to elaborate on the word. Maybe this is fixed through a dialogue moment about the pronunciation? 

"Ahh, you mean druden*haus.*")) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi there! 

You might remember me from the cult classic  ["Dad, Pull Grandma's Dentures Out of There!"](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4qx6qy/how_i_quit_smoking/)

I'm on the verge of posting my first story in over a month (wait, really...dammit, Bobby) and I'm curious about when you peeps post. 

I'm aware of the Tortilla Man's breakdown and that it doesn't generally matter, but that isn't what I'm asking. We all have our preferred times right? What are yours and why?

I used to try and post between 9a and 10a religiously. Now, my new job doesn't really give me that window anymore so I've got to change it up. Your turn! </TEXT>

Writing has really kept me safe and sane when I was going through some really, *really* dark times throughout my life.

Between all of the great people here, the (small) fan base I've developed through posting, and my fam at 30 Press I just feel more...I don't know, balanced?

I guess that's weird to say. Some random online community is what has really been able to keep my spirits lifted. But that's what it is. It's hard to find people who tick like I do. And now I've found literally [dozens](http://m.imgur.com/gallery/JqYTmjn). </TEXT>

[It's live on Amazon!](http://a.co/eiYYvOt)

All of the proceeds from this book are being donated to Helen's Fund at Recovery Resources here in Cleveland, Ohio. The fund is set up to help people with drug problems receive help, regardless of their ability to pay. I want to dive into the financial aspect for a hot second.

*Typos Included* is selling for $2.99 right now. Through Amazon KDP, I've elected to receive 70% royalties from each sale which will net $2.07 after fees, taxes, and the likes. That doesn't sound like a lot, but I'm also matching each sale up to $500 per year. To break that down:

One copy costs $2.99     
That earns me $2.07       
My match is $2.07

Total donation - $4.14 per sale

That should hopefully add up quickly!      

I'm going to be adding a spreadsheet to the sidebar of my [sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/subject1780) this weekend which will contain everything that goes on financially with this book and the donations so everyone can verify that I'm sticking to my commitment. 

That's all, folks!

<TITLE> Book Release and Drug Addiction </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-29 20:27:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys!

After many, many delays and procrastination (mostly procrastination), I'm ready to release my first book, a collection of poems and songs that I'm calling *Typos Included.*

This collection consists of my writings from about the age of fourteen (Tiny Mike!) up until I turned twenty-two. It's really special to me, and I've been unable to actually commit to this for years because of the things it reminds me of.

You might be asking yourself, "Mikey, that's cool and all, and I understand that you're nervous about releasing deep cuts, but what does this have to do with drugs?"

Well, after berating you for asking such a wordy question, I would share with you that during this entire time I was heavily experimenting with drugs. There were *a lot* of nights I would come home high and write. Hell, almost to the point that I couldn't write unless I was on drugs. But this isn't about me at all. 

For those who know me, I've always been very outspoken about drug addiction. I've experienced the effect of drugs and watched addiction consume people I love. I want to help people get away from that life. I've spoken with some local rehabilitation centers in Cleveland, Ohio and I've chosen to donate **100% of all money earned** from sales of this book to Helen's Fund at Recovery Resources. That specific fund is to assist people who don't have the financial resources to receive help - something I find very important. No one should be turned away when they want to get away from drugs.

Now, I don't expect this book to be some best-selling work that generates a ton of money for donations. Due to that, I'm going to match the sales/donations up to $500 every year, forever, to make sure the donations are worthwhile (unless I get super rich and famous one day, in which case I'll contribute more).

I'm hoping that my book will be a nice incentive to generate donations, but if you don't like me or don't want the book then consider donating directly to Recovery Resources [here](http://www.recres.org/Donating). 

Finally, to prove I'm not being shady or anything, I will be keeping a completely open spreadsheet on Google Drive that I will update on the first day of every month proving that the money from sales is going where I said it will. 

All of this goes live on Friday, February 10th. I'll have another post that Thursday with links and all that jazz.

That's all I've got.

If you know someone that needs help, reach out. Sometimes that's all it takes to change a life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "I need twenty bucks, that's it. C'mon, man."

"..for?"

"Drugs. Duh. I'm obviously an addict spiraling down a self-destructive path due to my obsession with being high literally *all* of the time."

I just stared at her blankly. Her accent was a thick, sarcastic one. So thick, in fact, that I'm not sure if she knew that I was aware of her addiction. Li...she was convinced she was fooling everyone because we were all too scared to speak up. Close friends and family pondering their loved one's existence while fearing phone calls from unknown numbers on a regular basis - all too busy standing in line at Starbucks to make a difference in someone's life. 

I wasn't the exception. I gave her the twenty dollars.

Li was driving on the highway when the heroin she injected earlier that morning kicked in. She typically would shoot up while she was doing her makeup so the high would kick in before she started heading to work. That morning, she had to do it while she was letting her dog out to pee before she left because she hit snooze too many times. Knowing Li, she was probably singing Michael Jackson and doing her eyeliner when she slammed into that dividing wall. The coroner told us that the cause of death was a severing of her spinal cord by a piece of her dashboard. He assured us that between the drugs and how she died, Li probably died almost instantly and didn't suffer. 

She didn't suffer. But she did, didn't she? 

She was suffering all along while we were all busy in line waiting on our lattes. I know she was. She sits at the side of my bed and tells me about it every night as she cries and pricks my arms with needles. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It varies. Everyone has a different workload and production process. I've had stories take two weeks or more to get done. I've had some get done in a day or less, too (sup, /u/IrrationalFearsHost and /u/atticusjackson). 

Just keep in mind that everyone has something going on and until it becomes their career, this is done between jobs and personal affairs. So, don't worry :) 

Ooh. Thought of something else. It might vary depending on whether they reached out to you, or if you reached out to them. This is just my opinion, but I feel that a narrator would be inclined to voice something they sought out more so than a request they receive. So, that could be a factor. Idk. I don't narrate. **Yet.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went to NOLA in '14. Fan. Fucking. Tastic. I've fallen in love with the city. Everyone there is so pleasant and happy. I took public transportation the entire four days I was there and had zero issues around the city and it's surroundings. I went to the pre-party. Stood in line for *hours* waiting to get my hands on merch in the hot Louisiana sun and still couldn't complain. I met amazing people who loved 311 just as much, if not more than I do. The show was on point. Such a crazy amount of energy and positive vibes. Seeing 311 in a huge venue like the Smoothie King Center was a whole new level for me. 100/10 would recommend.

Might be worth mentioning I went completely alone, too. And I still had that much fun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Think about what makes you choose to watch something on Netflix.

Is it the aesthetically pleasing slideshow?

Is it the title of the movie/show?

Is it the description of the movie/show?

Is it the rating?

See, as writers, we have no access to making a cool slideshow. We do, however, have the ability to title our stories in creative, appealing ways. We can't describe our stories, but we can have such a strong opening that readers instantly get sucked in. Orrrrr...a lot of people (and I mean *a lot* of people) will read the highest upvoted stories and we can't do anything about that. 

So, maybe consider what makes you pick something new on Netflix and apply that to your story.

Or just be really fucking lucky. </TEXT>

<TEXT> By far, horror is my favorite genre. I don't have much of a preference between types of stories. I do, however, prefer writers who don't overdo it on the descriptions. Like, I get the whole "show don't tell" mentality. I agree. It's smart. But if a man is sitting in a chair smoking a cigar and holding a glass of whiskey, just say it. I don't need some flowery description to let me know he's doing that. So yea. That tends to turn me off of stories. Everything else is cool though. I like pretty much anything, I just prefer horror.  

I'm also a big Bukowski fan.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I *have* to be that guy and say that I don't consider anything I've written to be bad, and I feel that each one was amazing in its own way. 

Buuuuuuuutttttttttt....at the moment, I consider [Robots Need Less Than Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/5ckuyq/robots_need_less_than_three_noir_contest/) to be the best story I've written/personal favorite. Why do I love it so? It's a darn tootin' good story! Oh. And I feel that I acheived a very good level of world building and character development with it. I read it and feel immersed into the world my character, Micah, is living in. I've gotten a lot of praise for it as well from peers here as well as people from my personal life. It also reminds me that I can step out of the box and do something great. I thought I would always be writing scary stories, and this is a Sci-fi/Noir. I didn't know I could even do that! I love it. It's also a tribute to a friend of mine and my younger days. I'm not going all mushy, though. 

Biggest screw-up? Man. [This one](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4o9owl/she_has_to_know/) haunts me. I wrote it when I first made this account and started contributing regularly. I had these great ideas, subtle hints, and a mindfuck ending...and I'll missed the mark on every single thing. The story became a jumbled mess of what I thought was going to be a juggernaut of a story. I still have a soft spot for it, though, because it reminds me of exactly what to do wrong. I learned a lot from writing it - how to be clear, details, etc. It was also a concept my girlfriend and I came up with together. Blargh. No more mushy. 

Also, this woman on the train keeps staring at me with *those* eyes. I'm uncomfortable. I think she's a hooker. Like seriously.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, *this.* Lifestyle inflation is a killer. Get accommodated to the 52k. Depending on your location that could be more than enough to have a good life. Then, if you land the higher paying position, invest in your future like Ash points out above this.

**DO NOT** buy fancy new things because you got a 10k raise in six months. **Don't do it.** 

Adding on:

If you can avoid it, don't do it for the first raise, either! If you can keep your costs low and income high, you will be in a beautiful spot my friend. By this I mean don't force yourself to eat ramen and watch t.v. on a 16 inch tube, but don't eat at Applebee's every night and buy a curved flat screen. Moderation. Balance.  </TEXT>

*Working Title* - **South Dakota Doesn't Exist**

---

Matt's New Year's Eve party was *the* gathering of the year in our group of friends. He was one of those guys that was made to be successful, and he spared no expense making sure everyone knew he was doing well for himself. Every year, he would pay off his neighbors and have the entire top floor of his downtown apartment vacant aside from those of us lucky enough to make the guest list. This past year, on top of the fully-staffed open bar he had in his apartment, he hired an entire staff of cooks from one of Michael Symon's restaurants who were making virtually anything your heart could desire. 

I won't lie, I wasn't a huge fan of Matt - he was kind of a dick - but we grew up together, and deep down I knew if I missed his social gatherings it would kill him. What I did instead of bailing was take full advantage of that open bar. Drunk Mary is a more tolerant Mary - one that can deal with the Dick King. 

The party, from what I remember, was booming. The dance floor was so packed that I swear the floors started bouncing when the DJ played "Shots." It was fun. I'll admit it. Even from my post at the bar, it was fun. Well...until about 11:30pm when the DJ had the bright idea to go around the room and have everyone announce their resolutions for the new year. 

"To lose weight!" Some guy yelled.

"Pay off my student loans!" From another.

"Not have a baby!" Matt yelled - everyone laughed. 

"What about you, Miss Thang?" The DJ pointed his mic to me from across the room. 

"I...I don't, uh. I don't have one, sorry." Everyone laughed at me, too. 

"Come on, Mar. You've gotta have *something* you wanna do!" Matt slithered over to me and put his arm around my shoulders as everyone watched us. I'm sure it made at least four girls jealous. "What do you want to get done? Anything in the world!"

"Um. I guess I'd like to travel more. That'd be cool." 

"Travel! Our girl Mar wants to travel!" Matt announcrd, causing the room to erupt in applause. 

The DJ moved onto the next person as Matt stayed with me and helped himself to the stool next to mine. He had that *fucking* grin on his face. He was about to say something stupid. 

"Mar. What if-"

"Mary. You know I hate it when you call me that." I interrupted. 

"So sorry, *Mary.*" He chuckled. "What if I told you something crazy that would blow your fucking mind? Two patron, man."

"Go for it." 

"South Dakota. You know it isn't a real place, right? Like, it's just a paper state. It holds a place on maps and that's it!"

I chuckled. "Really? That's what you're trying to 'blow my mind' with?" Matt winced - he always hated when I imitated him. We took our shots. 

"No, really! Have you ever met someone from South Dakota? Been there? When was the last time something from South Dakota made the news? Listen. You want to travel, right? I'll *pay* for you to go check this out. Whole trip. Plane ticket. Hotel. Food. Fuck, I'll buy you a whole new wardrobe for the trip." 

"I don't know. It sounds cool, I guess. And I can make you look like an ass just by going on vacation. I'll have to see if I can take time off of work."

"Mar. *Mary.* I've got it. You know better than anyone that I can fix that up for you."

"Ha, go for it, dude."

"I will! You're like a sister to me. A sister I've banged a few times, but a sist-"

"Stop."

"Okay, okay. I just want to help you live life. I'll make the arrangements. You just show up. Let's fuckin' dance!" He yanked me off of the stool by my wrists and the rest of the night now sits as a drunken blur of bad decisions in my memory.

True to his word, Matt arranged for me to have two weeks - paid - off of work by the end of the following day. He was an dick, but a powerful one nonetheless. My plane ticket was hand-delivered to my desk by the man himself.

"6:17am. Friday. Allegiant out of Akron/Canton. Towncar will pick you up at 5. Let's go shopping and shit."

"Jesus Christ. You're really serious about this?" I replied in disbelief.

"Duh. Let's go."

Matt didn't spare any expense in his bribery. Saks Fifth Avenue. Nordstrom. Victoria's Secret. Oakley. I felt like a call-girl that he was trying to keep quiet so his main squeeze wouldn't find out anything...but it was nice. Over the years I ran through a nice streak of terrible men. Getting spoiled a bit was refreshing, to say the least. Even if it was for Matt's personal gain, as stupid as it was. I just didn't get it - why South Dakota? Matt couldn't really answer anything aside from making wild claims that it just didn't exist.

I spent my free time before the trip Googling everything I could about South Dakota. Airports. Companies. Politics. News stories. I couldn't figure out where he got the notion the *entire state* was a sham. I mean, they have a freaking [*university*](http://www.usd.edu/) for Christ's sake! I couldn't find anything online except for some poorly designed conspiracy theory websites that even hinted at South Dakota not being real. The only thing I could give Matt credit for was that I had never in my life met someone from the state. At my job, my entire role is dealing with hundreds of clients from all across the United States. South Dakota was the only state I had never had a client from...and I highly doubted that no one in the entire state had medical debt. For what it was worth, that slightly arose my suspicion.

Friday morning, just like Matt said, the driver was in front of my house at 5:00am sharp. Friendly guy, and damn good driver. He got me to the airport in less than thirty minutes and didn't run a single red light. I didn't think that was possible for a human being to do. My flight was another story. With Matt being so willing to splurge on clothes and frivolous items to make me agree to the trip, I didn't expect to have to deal with economy seating. 

About three hours into the flight, the pilot came on over the loudspeaker with an announcement:

"Ladies and gentlemen, it looks like we're going to have to make an unscheduled stop before reaching our destination. It uhh...appears our plane was improperly fueled for this flight. We'll be landing at Hettinger Municipal Airport in Hettinger, North Dakota to refuel. On behalf of Allegiant Airlines, I would like to apologize for the inconvenience and I reassure you that the airline will compensate you for the trouble. Thank you. Could all attendants please prepare for landing procedures."

When we landed down, I turned my phone back on and the first thing that popped onto my screen was a text from Matt.

"Got you a rental. Don't worry about it. You're just outside the border. Head down to Hertz and they'll have ot ready for you."

<TEXT> Dentistry was my entire life. Teeth, I mean, everyone sees them. Nice smiles go farther than most things. You need them to eat. Bite. *Nibble.* I can't remember a time when I wasn't obsessed with teeth. I was the top student in my class and I was the youngest dentist to receive a position with the prestigious office I worked at.

Then they "downsized."

I was told that they were giving me an extended vacation until the numbers balanced out again. Then, they would bring me right back on board. I was young. I believed them...for the first few months.

My wife was mostly supportive until about six months in, that's when she told me to "get a job...or at least a hobby or something." She was right, even if she was being a bitch about it. I didn't do much for that time I was out of work and once I realized it, my mind went into a panic. What if I lost my skills that I spent a fortune honing and perfecting?! 

Luckily, I was able to purchase a *really* nice kit of dental tools off of Amazon for less than a small fortune, as well as dummy teeth for practice. It was lovely...for a while. The problem with fake teeth, however, is they don't get the true wear-and-tear that human teeth do. I needed to go back, but my office stopped answering my calls. 

I'll admit, I was leery of performing any work without novocaine. One of my philosophies was to always make sure the patient was entirely comfortable and free of pain. But, my wife was a master of dishing out pain, so I didn't worry when she squirmed underneath the restraints. However, I *did* feel kind of bad as I drilled right into the roof of her mouth. The crunch was loud enough that I didn't really need her screaming in my face to tell she was hurting. She fucking moved though. Who moves when there's a drill in their mouth? Idiot. While I was plugging up her wound with gauze, I noticed her molars were atrocious. They needed to be fixed...but I opted for extraction instead. Honestly, there is only so much a dentist can do for a tooth. 

An unintended side-effect of too much dental work at one time was the passing of my wife. I didn't want that. I just wanted practice. There was too much blood - I couldn't stop it. 

An interesting side-effect of my wife passing, however, is the lack of blood when I practice on her every day. It seems as time goes on she's just drying up. It's nice, honestly.

I wonder if any funeral homes need a dentist. </TEXT>

She shook her head.

"So, we just lay there without anything going on and it's fine? 'Bodies' can't handle that. Hell, if I sit too long I get messed up. But you're telling me I can lay in one position for hours and my body is cool, and that's that. No. We *have* to be updating or something. The system doesn't stop. We'd become self-aware."

"Sorry. I don't have an answer for you." She replied as she hooked wires to my temples. "When you see the number '100,' answer the phone. Tomorrow is a new day." </TEXT>

<TEXT> It started with her singing. A song with lyrics about lost love and depressions. Then she started speaking his name in vain - her lover. He was half her age and three times as manipulative. No one fully understood the emotional rollercoaster he put her through...until now.

The video continued on with her airing out *all* of her dirty laundry. She couldn't take anymore and she wanted the viewers to know the truth. The likes and comments came flooding in as the minutes dragged on. Messages of "don't do anything" and "it will be okay" were a blanket in the comment section. 

Yet no one called the cops. No one reached out to her family.

With tears in her eyes she pulled out a gun and held it to the side of her head. 

*Bang.*

The phone fell with her. Gurgling. Clinging to life. Finally people acted. Luckily it wasn't too late. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a lot of inner demons, which translates into *literally* every story I've written to-date having some sort of truth about me in it. Whether it's an expetience, fear, etc. Writing about it really helps me cope. For example, my mom was recently in the hospital with kidney failure - I wrote [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5ebeyg/give_it_to_her_shell_die_without_it/https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5ebeyg/give_it_to_her_shell_die_without_it/). Sometimes it isn't central to the plot like that. It's always there, though.

Also, to be perfectly honest, I've always wanted to be a great writer. It's just taken me 25 years to become comfortable with trying. So that constantly keeps me motivated to keep publishing stories and writing about new topics. 

Finally, I *love* horror. I grew up on it. Think what you will, but my mom introduced me to horror movies when I was still a single-digit age. It didn't scar me. Well, I do have some *irrational fears* from some things (ha, get it /u/IrrationalFearsHost?! I said your podcast name), but nothing that's negatively impacted my life. Instead, I fell in love. I love being scared or disturbed. I love not being able to sleep at night. I want to do for other people what all of those great horror directors amd writers did for me.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The moment we turned the corner and the orange-bricked high-rise came into view, my stomach churned and I winced. 

"It's okay, bud." Dad said as he put his hand on my knee. He must have noticed my unease. "Grandma is doing fine. She just needed to live in a place where people can help her when she needs it."

As we pulled into the sloping, cracked parking lot I could finally make out the tiny letters above the forest green awning: *Harbour Court.* An assisted living facility...my grandma's new home. 

Grandma was passing out candy on Halloween when she had the stroke. A little boy dressed up as the Grim Reaper rang her doorbell and as she was leaning out of her screen door to place a candy bar into his pillowcase, she collapsed. Fortunately for her, the little boy ran and got his parents. If he didn't...my grandma might not be here today. Dad liked to joke that she thought "death finally came for her," but I knew the truth - I went with my dad to everything. I was sitting on grandma's old flower-print couch while Dad sat in the kitchen with the doctors. The truth was that she wasn't healthy. Too many high calorie foods and too many sweets. They said it clogged her arteries and it finally caught up with her....and it could happen again. Dad didn't want to take the risk of her being alone next time. 

The lobby smelled like lavender body spray and milk, either from the residents or the haggard looking receptionist who checked us in. 

"Room 216, elevators are on the left." She croaked. Dad had a hard time trying to hide his laugh. 

We rode the elevator up, and as soon as the doors opened we were greeted by a woman wearing scrubs that barely covered her and her tattoos. 

"Hi, I'm Megan. Are you the family of Mrs. Lemons?" She asked in an overly bubbly tone.

"Ye-yeah. Yes. I'm her son, Abe, and this is her grandson, Sade." 

"Awesome! Nice to meet you guys! Really quick, I just want to go over some things with you before you visit with Mrs. Lemons. Follow me, please!" She walked over to a small, dingy desk with a slight skip in her step. 

"So, you guys are like, the first people to come visit her since she moved in aaaaand we don't know how well she's going to do with family members."

"We're her only family. Her daughter - my wife -  passed away a couple of years ago. She doesn't have any living relatives." He informed her, almost under his breath.

"Oh. *Oh*. Okay. Well, you should know that there have been a couple of incidents with our staff in-"

"What do you mean, 'incidents?'" Dad interjected.

"Um. Welllllll...she just gets really weird sometimes. Like, we let her cook to help with her motor skills. But she'll like, make so much food to share with people. But the people don't exist. And she like won't let anyone touch it. She just kind of hoards it." Megan, for the first time, lost her spunkiness. Whatever my grandma was doing genuinely seemed to bother her.

"Guess we'll just have to carry some crosses then, right buddy?" Dad joked as he tuffled my hair with his hand. 

"Right!" I exclaimed. If my dad wasn't bothered by something, neither was I - no matter how scary it seemed.

Megan walked us down the short hall and left us in front of a light brown door with the faded blue numbers "216" adorning the top of the frame. 

"If you need *anything* I'll be right down at the desk." She said as she walked away. 

"Jeesh, maybe the phone number for the store where you buy your clothes." Dad chuckled as he nudged me towards the door. "Let's go on in."

I pushed the door in and it let out a loud creak that startled the old, gray-haired woman sitting at a desk.

"Hi Grandma!" I ran over to her and gave her a hug.

"Jesus, Sade! You almost gave me a heart attack! Aw, but you're so big!" She returned my hug, smothering me in her floral print bosom. "Come here, Abe!" 

My Dad walked over with a smile on his face, but it slowly diminished as he came closer. 

"What's with all this food?" He asked my grandma as he pointed to the wall behind her. 

In my haste and excitement, I hadn't even noticed the mountains of sweets piled halfway up the barren, cream wall. Trays, plates, and pans overflowing with everything imaginable. Cookies, cupcakes, buckeyes, peanut brittle...even her famous peppermint bark! 

"Just some baking I've been doing. These people are nice to me and don't want me to stop like those stupid doctors do." She snarled at the end. " Go ahead and have some! *There's peppermint bark.*"

"Maybe later, Ma." Dad said quickly.

"Oh honey, don't be stubborn. *Everyone* loves my peppermint bark. Eat some!" 

Dad ignored her and walked over to the large window that was illuminating her room. I followed him over, but not before Grandma handed me a little piece of the bark while holding her index finger up to her lips. It was really hard, so I didn't take a bite. 

"They treating you okay?" Dad asked her as he looked out the window. 

"What's wrong with my candy?" 

"Sorry?"

"What's wrong with my candy?" My grandma was standing up now, holding a plate of her bark and tears in her eyes. "Eat it, Sade."

"I'm okay. I'm full Grandma, I'll eat it when I get home - promise!" I said with a smile. Dad taught me before that a little white lie never hurt anyone. My dad turned around a stared at my grandma with a concerned look on his face. My heartbeat started tripping over itself as I moved a little closer to him. 

"Sade!" She yelled as she dropped the plate. My dad put himself between my grandma and I. She bent down and picked up a larger piece of the candy. "Eat it, Sade. It's delicious - look!"

"Mom!" My dad shouted in a commanding way, but she didn't respond. My grandma took a bite of the bark in her hand. I could hear the crunching across the room. It made my stomach hurt. 

"Look, it's fine!" She smiled, letting thick blood ooze out from between her lips. It ran down her chin and fell onto her blouse. Dad didn't move - he just held me behind him. 

"I have some stuck in my teeth - can't have that, can we?" Her tongue wiped her teeth clean as she spoke. Then, my grandma took the peppermint bark and dug a pointed edge into her gums, wedging it in all sorts of different directions as more blood rained from her mouth. "There we go!" She gurgled. She took her fingers and pulled a tooth from her mouth. "No more of that."

My dad was a statue, slowly turning white with a hint of green. I stayed behind him hoping he would do something...but he didn't. My grandma kept walking towards us, digging peppermint bark into her gums and ripping her teeth out while blood fell everywhere. She never stopped smiling as she removed all of her front teeth. Grandma stopped in front of my dad and bent down to my level. 

"Make sure you brush when you're done eating." She chimed as she turned the bark vertically and began rubbing it between her gums like a toothbrush. She was so close that I could see the cuts being made into her mouth, like a saw cutting into wood. I couldn't take anymore. I ran out from behind my dad and out to the desk where I found Megan. 

"Code Three!" She screamed as she ran into the room, closely followed by a bunch of men and women also in scrubs. I ran after them too. 

In the room, Grandma was on top of my dad's chest still carving into her gums with the peppermint bark. She was leaning over his face, letting blood squirt into his mouth, eyes, and everywhere it could go. The aides stuck a large needle into her neck and she collapsed to the side. They split parties, some tending to my dad and others to my grandma. 

The combination of the sedative they used, her loss of blood, and mania caused her to die almost instantly. She was cremated - a decision made by Harbour Court as no one was claiming responsibility for her. There was no funeral. 

After my dad got out of the hospital, he wasn't the same. Apparently having a stroke as bad as his can severely disrupt how the brain functions. We lived very quietly for a few months until some men from the state came and took me. My dad was forced into the local assisted living facility - Harbour Court. While I was in foster care I used to write him letters every week...even though he never responded. Once I turned eighteen I went to Harbour Court to visit him for the first time. When I got off of the elevator and older woman covered in tattoos greeted me in an overly bubbly tone.

"Hi, I'm Megan! Are you here to see Abe?" 

"Uh. Yeah. I'm his son, Sade."

"Okay, awesome! Before we go over, you should know he's had some...incidents." She paused. "See, we like, let him bake to help with his motor fun-"

"Sorry, I have to be going." I interrupted her, then walked away.

I've never gone back.

Mourning Wood is another good one.

"What's with all this food?" He asked my grandma as he pointed to the wall behind her. 

In my haste and excitement, I hadn't even noticed the mountains of sweets piled halfway up the barren, cream wall. Trays, plates, and pans overflowing with everything imaginable. Cookies, cupcakes, buckeyes, peanut brittle...even her famous peppermint bark! 

"Just some baking I've been doing. These people are nice to me and don't want me to stop like those stupid doctors do." She snarled at the end. " Go ahead and have some! *There's peppermint bark.*"

"Maybe later, Ma." Dad said quickly.

"Oh honey, don't be stubborn. *Everyone* loves my peppermint bark. Eat some!" 

Dad ignored her and walked over to the large window that was illuminating her room. I followed him over, but not before Grandma handed me a little piece of the bark while holding her index finger up to her lips. It was really hard, so I didn't take a bite. 

"They treating you okay?" Dad asked her as he looked out the window. 

"What's wrong with my candy?" 

"Sorry?"

"What's wrong with my candy?" My grandma was standing up now, holding a plate of her bark and tears in her eyes. "Eat it, Sade."

"I'm okay. I'm full Grandma, I'll eat it when I get home - promise!" I said with a smile. Dad taught me before that a little white lie never hurt anyone. My dad turned around a stared at my grandma with a concerned look on his face. My heartbeat started tripping over itself as I moved a little closer to him. 

"Sade!" She yelled as she dropped the plate. My dad put himself between my grandma and I. She bent down and picked up a larger piece of the candy. "Eat it, Sade. It's delicious - look!"

"Mom!" My dad shouted in a commanding way, but she didn't respond. My grandma took a bite of the bark in her hand. I could hear the crunching across the room. It made my stomach hurt. 

"Look, it's fine!" She smiled, letting thick blood ooze out from between her lips. It ran down her chin and fell onto her blouse. Dad didn't move - he just held me behind him. 

"I have some stuck in my teeth - can't have that, can we?" Her tongue wiped her teeth clean as she spoke. Then, my grandma took the peppermint bark and dug a pointed edge into her gums, wedging it in all sorts of different directions as more blood rained from her mouth. "There we go!" She gurgled. She took her fingers and pulled a tooth from her mouth. "No more of that."

My dad was a statue, slowly turning white with a hint of green. I stayed behind him hoping he would do something...but he didn't. My grandma kept walking towards us, digging peppermint bark into her gums and ripping her teeth out while blood fell everywhere. She never stopped smiling as she removed all of her front teeth. Grandma stopped in front of my dad and bent down to my level. 

"Make sure you brush when you're done eating." She chimed as she turned the bark vertically and began rubbing it between her gums like a toothbrush. She was so close that I could see the cuts being made into her mouth, like a saw cutting into wood. I couldn't take anymore. I ran out from behind my dad and out to the desk where I found Megan. 

"Code Three!" She screamed as she ran into the room, closely followed by a bunch of men and women also in scrubs. I ran after them too. 

In the room, Grandma was on top of my dad's chest still carving into her gums with the peppermint bark. She was leaning over his face, letting blood squirt into his mouth, eyes, and everywhere it could go. The aides stuck a large needle into her neck and she collapsed to the side. They split parties, some tending to my dad and others to my grandma. 

The combination of the sedative they used, her loss of blood, and mania caused her to die almost instantly. She was cremated - a decision made by Harbour Court as no one was claiming responsibility for her. There was no funeral. 

After my dad got out of the hospital, he wasn't the same. Apparently having a stroke as bad as his can severely disrupt how the brain functions. We lived very quietly for a few months until some men from the state came and took me. My dad was forced into the local assisted living facility - Harbour Court. While I was in foster care I used to write him letters every week...even though he never responded. Once I turned eighteen I went to Harbour Court to visit him for the first time. When I got off of the elevator an older woman covered in tattoos greeted me in an overly bubbly tone.

"Hi, I'm Megan! Are you here to see Abe?" 

"Uh. Yeah. I'm his son, Sade."

"Okay, awesome! Before we go over, you should know he's had some...incidents." She paused. "See, we like, let him bake to help with his motor fun-"

"Sorry, I have to be going." I interrupted her, then walked away.

<TEXT> Sooooooooooooo, here's my notes:

- Yes, I believe taking a bit more time may have benefited you. I don't mean this in an offensive way, but it almost seemed like I was reading a comment on an AskReddit thread about creepy experiences as opposed to a story. 

- With that, I really dig the concept. It was a little freaky to think about that ending for a second when I put myself in that situation. I would aim to elaborate if you want to revisit this. You can really creep it up, so to speak.

- Avoid using two words close together. I believe it was your second paragraph's first sentence that began with "now" and ended with "now." 

- There were a lot of unnecessary details that didn't affect the plot. Try to limit those. An example would be how it's normally dark when you went to work that time of year. I get why it was mentioned, but it didn't actually have anything to do with what was going on. 

I like it. Don't take my notes as a deterrent! I like to be honest in order to help :)

Keep writing!

I don't think that the two points you made about the true intent of the rule and the role-playing aspect are mutually exclusive. The role-playing is almost necessary to preserve the "sanctity" of the comments. To me, the role-playing is the means by which the true purpose of the rule is upheld. Also, some of these stories are *really* fucking believable. A lot of people moght think they're true. I know I've gotten my fair share of messages from people who genuinely seem to believe my stories. Just wanted to add that in.

<TEXT> Kind of ruins the excitement of a cliffhanger, doesn't it? I do see your point. You would know exactly how long it's going to be. You know how much commitment it would take to read a series. You know it has an end.

Well, what fun is life if you know how far out the end of everything is? Life ends, would you want to know when you die? (Don't answer that, I'm being rhetorical)

Also, on a more practical and less I'm-sleep-deprived-and-delusional note, I would wager that requiring writers to post the number of parts to a series would have a direct effect on views. Do you think someone would be more likely to dive into a thirteen-part epic that could run on for weeks or a three-part series that will be done in three days with minimal commitment or waiting?

I'm not good at ending things. Uh. Wubba lubba dub dub, bitches!

There's quite a few movies that use a similar premise. Ever since *Paranormal Activity* people have been trying to cash in on that success in any way they can. Probably nothing, but we won't know until it comes out (if).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone hates Mondays. I'm not the exception to this. Well, I hate Mon*day*, in particular. I don't hate them all. Just one - the one I'm stuck in. Or...on, perhaps? I don't really know how to refer to this dilemma. If it's truly a dilemma. We succeeded in the Murray Experiment...time is frozen. It's just...I'm the only one here.

Currently, I'm sitting at my desk recording these events in the office I shared with Dr. Parsons. I wish the University would have let him keep his position as a physical science professor. Chris was as smart as they come, but he's...limited when it comes to financial matters. I suppose a job is a job. It definitely was the better alternative offered to him following the experiment.

Dr. Christopher Parsons and I are.*were* scientists. Well...scientists in the sense that we convinced a legitimate educational institution to finance our studies into the applications of time manipulation. 

Yes, that's right - time manipulation is a real thing. Time, as most people know it, is simply a unit of measurement. Minutes, hours, days, years - all units devised so humans can place a number on things. It's a weird obsession we have. None of that is real...tangible. However, it's undeniable that time exists. Organisms age. Seasons come and go. Food decays. Nothing known to man could escape that reality until Dr. Parsons and I discovered the *billimite.*

Yes, as you probably guessed we really enjoy *Groundhog Day.* It was very apropos given our intentions. 


The billimite is a phenomenal creature! Most people are familiar with the tardigrade, a virtually indestructible, microscopic creature that can even live exposed in space. Yes, that is cool. However, the billimite is infinitely more sensational. The term mite is used affectionately. This creature is closer to the size of a rat fetus, and has fully developed, fully functioning body systems. It isn't a mammal, but it's internal makeup is almost identical and the differences are negligible. What truly sets the billimite apart is its inability to age. It simply cannot. Chris and I dissected dozens of these beings to discover their inner workings. They. Don't. Age. Not on the surface. Not on a cellular layer. They're frozen in time. 


We knew that harnessing the ability these things have to cease aging would be a breakthrough unlike anything ever seen by the human race. I mean, imagine the possibilities! The aging process could have been halted. Those with terminal illnesses could be put in suspension until a cure was created. Cryogenics had become increasingly popular, but our findings could have given people the same benefit without putting their lives on hold. Thus began the Murray Experiment.


The trials were only done on mice - terminally ill ones, at that. We had a plethora of them as there was an infectious disease research center sharing the same university as us. I still question why they funded us, honestly. That's besides the point. Chris and I, well, we didn't exactly know where to start. Billimites don't age, but they also don't have anything in their biological makeup that appears to be the source of their...power. So we started with the basics. 


The first trial was blood transfusions. While small, billimites have a full circulatory system complete with red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets...the works. We had to use very, very thin needles as the opaque white skin of the billimites doesn't favor showing any veins. They're also incredibly smooth and a bit of a pain to pin down. Once one got a needle through the subcutaneous layer, the billimites would begin writhing in pain. This, combined with their smooth skin, made it virtually impossible to land a second successful injection. The mice didn't respond well to the new blood. Their bodies began rapidly shutting down within one day of receiving the donor blood. Failure.


Next, we skipped ahead and went with a more...unconventional approach - consumption. We took billimites and carefully (and humanely, PETA) removed various sections from their bodies to feed to the mice. Although we had dissected enough of them, cutting their limbs away was nothing short of bizarre. Upon applying pressure to an appendage, their bones would seem to vanish and we would be making cuts similar to those of a filet mignon with a butter knife. If you can imagine a naked mole rat, 50 times smaller, that's the size of what we had to deal with and we were still having many difficulties cutting away pieces. The mice that ate the body parts displayed symptoms similar to malaria, and died within one week on ingestion. 


The trials were numerous and tiresome on Chris and I. We had many late nights discussing abandoning the experiment over scotch. Every time, maybe due to the alcohol, we managed to convince each other to persevere. One of our last resorts was stem cell injections. We had postponed attempting the technique due to the high chances of failure, but after months of various tests we finally made the plunge. 


It was a Monday. 1:18pm, Eastern Standard Time. Dr. Parsons and I had every single thing perfectly prepared for the transplant. Extra restraints on the billimite. Overly sterilized equipment. Multiple checks. Multiple balances. We weren't willing to try this twenty times like the other, simpler trials. I also used my two index fingers to attempt to keep the billimite stable when it would undoubtedly start convulsing. Chris steadied his needle as a drip of sweat made its way from my brow down to my beard. I was flush. The ticking from the wall clock ceased to exist. We were living in one moment, one last opportunity to possibly save mankind from the inevitable. Chris began his approach with the needle. As the tip penetrated its skin, the billimite let out a small yelp, like a puppy being left alone. We had never heard these creatures make noise before. Chris and I shared a glance, unsure what to do. We had already teetered on the ledge of ethics but that noise unsettled both of us. It was infantile. A helpless baby, crying for help from its mother. We searched the others face for an answer and as I nodded to Chris to continue a piercing pain shot up my hand into my head. The billimite stabbed me with a thin, whisker-like protrusion from its head. I became severely lightheaded and moved back to sit up against the wall.


I nodded off for a brief moment. When I awoke, Chris was on the ground in front of me, body lurched towards the ground, crying. I thought that my attempts to console him were fruitless because he was too far gone. Maybe he finally cracked. We were under a lot of stress due to the numerous failures in the Murray Experiment. 


I ran down to the shared office of the psych professors, hoping they could help. I don't know why. It felt right not making a huge ordeal of the situation. This was a confidential matter between professionals, not a university-wide scandal. When I got the office and knocked, the older female professor, Joyce, answered and looked directly at me, baffled. Then she closed the door. I knocked again. Joyce opened the door, this time coming out into the hallway before she closed the door again. I knocked for a third time. Joyce answered the door again, with an angry demeanor. Stop this nonsense! She snarled out of the doorway. She began to close the door. 


Joyce! I yelled as I grabbed her forearm. She fell to her knees. The other professor ran over to her side, asking if she need a medic. 


No, no...it-its fine. Just a ringing in my ear, that's all. Must have scraped my arm on the door. It burns a bit, but I'm fine. 


I briskly made my way back to Chris. I didn't have time for whatever games were going on or any ridiculous experiments those crazy old bats were conducting. 


Our lab was quarantined and guarded. Chris was gone. 


I didn't wait up. 


I walked back to my house on campus and started frantically looking up any breaking news stories. I needed to know what the media was saying. I needed to have a story ready for any interviews, good...or bad. 


Nothing. It must have been too recent for the news outlets to have grabbed hold of it. 


I got a ping notifying me of a new email. 


*Nate,*


*I'm sorry. It should have been me. I never knew your family or friends, but if you're one of them and reading this, I loved Nate like a brother. I never would have continued our research had I know it could end up this way. I'm so, so, so sorry.*


*Dr. Christopher Parsons, Sc.D.*

*Ohio State University*


The sincerity of his email finally set off a red flag that something was wrong. Chris wasn't an outwardly emotional person. Something happened to me during the Murray Experiment. I responded to the email with a simple question:


Chris, what happened?


In his response, Dr. Parsons explained to me that as I fell back into the wall and sat down, my body began to age rapidly - faster than ice in hot soup. Then it began to decompose into nothingness. There was no trace that I had ever been up against that wall. I was...gone.


I spent that entire day emailing Chris about everything besides the actual experiment. I was bitter about not finishing the stem cell transplant and avoided the topic like a plague. He wasn't arrested in my disappearance. The cameras that the university installed in our labs (unbeknownst to us) caught the same scenario he described to me. It was chalked up to the nature of the experiment. It was covered up and he was free to go. Immediately. While they could take months at a time to process a grant, they somehow were able to cover-up a disaster and make a decision in regards to Chris future in a few hour's time. 


A few hours time? That wasn't right. It couldn't have been. In my years with the university and my run-ins with law enforcement, **nothing** processed that fast. Hell, I was killed on camera! 


It hit me. I asked Chris what day it was. Thursday. The same day my computer was showing me. The same day on the news and my phone. It hadn't dawned on me that I never slept after returning home. Nor needed to use the facilities. Or eat and drink. I went to the bathroom and my unibrow hadn't grown in, as it has every couple days since puberty. Chris agreed to meet me Friday at noon to figure things out over coffee. 


I laid in bed that night, contemplating the circumstances surrounding my existence. I didn't sleep. Sun went down. Moon came up. Moon went down. Sun came up. 


I got to Starbucks a little bit after Chris did. I almost burst into a full run when I saw him and I jumped slightly onto his back when I got close, like old times. He collapsed, but got back up rather quickly, slightly red in the face. 


You okay? I asked him. He didn't respond. Just stuck a pinky in his ear and gave it a quick wiggle. A moment or two later, he pulled out his phone and started typing me an email.


*Nate,


*Sorry I missed you. Have to get to class. Let's link up ASAP.*


*Chris.*


I responded immediately from my own phone. We went to the university, separate...but together. 


We ran experiments in the infectious disease lab. Chris would tell me what to do, and I would do it. Or object via email. 


First objective, grab a mouse. Simple. I placed my hand on top of the one that Chris placed on the table. It cried as it died in my palm. 


Second objective, communicate to someone. I went into the hallway between classes and started calling out familiar students by name. They all had similar reactions - rubbing their ears in one form or another. 


Third objective, lift a book. So I did, as Chris recorded it with his phone. He played it back to me. I saw myself life the book and place it at the other end of the table. On the video, the book just appeared on the other side in a blink. 


We did mundane tests like this for hours - well into the night. Chris and I learned what I'm able to do and what I cannot do. Our hypothesis is that the billimite injected me with some sort of chemical that we hadn't seen in our analysis of their inner workings. That chemical, due to whatever possible reason, was able to imbue me with the same benefits that the billimite has - lack of aging. However, it's also placed me into a sort of ethereal time zone where I can observe the world around me aging and progressing, all the while being absolved from it. 


We need to find another billimite. It appears, however, that someone has wiped them from existence. The best is gone. Our specimens are gone. It's like they never existed...just like me. My house, my belongings, and all of my research have vanished. There's no trace that I existed aside from the memories of people who knew me. I'm a ghost, as is Chris.


He was killed about eight years ago. Chris was at home in his study when a man in red came up behind him and strangled him with a wire. I tried grabbing the man around the neck, but before I could get close his dog came from the other room and attacked me, pulling me to the floor. There were so many emotions running through me at that moment, but I was stuck on bliss. Bliss for the first physical interaction I had in years. It almost completely overshadowed the horror of my only contact in the outside world...and my closest friend...being killed. 


The man in red whistled to his dog once the deed was done and it ceased attacking me. It sat still, in fact. Glaring at me with it's head tilted to the side.


There's others. It spoke to me. 


The man in red whistled again and they were gone. I tried calling 911, but the operators couldn't hear me. After almost ten calls, an officer finally showed up and discovered Chris body. 


They ruled his death a suicide.


In the years since then, I've focused all of my efforts on finding the others that are like me. Chris, while I do miss him, might have served a greater purpose in his death and I've come to terms with that now. I need a way out. We weren't making any progress. The man in red and his dog gave me something Chris never could:

<TEXT> Stagnation. Or something. Loss of passion amid the cries of wolf and the subsequent proof of a vicious attack? Crimson trails in the snow. We can romanticize anything with descriptive words.

There's two sides. Or there isn't. Or is there? Maybe there's eleven. It's probably believers or non-believers, but what if there's more? What if some people believe there could be a wolf but don't believe the attacks really happened? Middle-aged middle-class minds making middle-ground assumptions.

<TITLE> Different opinions on how to proceed with bathroom tiling. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-13 14:12:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm doing a partial bathroom renovation. I'm getting ready to move onto the flooring part and I'm running into a small issue on difference of opinion on how to proceed. 

The house is 100 years old, and the original (under two layers of laminate) flooring in the bathroom was hardwood. It's covered in adhesive and more or less destroyed. **I don't have any pictures handy, sorry**. In all of the tile jobs I've done (assistant, this is my first solo run) I've always pulled up all of the flooring down to the subfloor, replaced if needed, added cement board, and then proceeded with the tiling. 

However, my girlfriend and some of the handier people in her family believe that I don't need to take up the hardwood flooring, and that I can just lay down the cement board over it and proceed with tiling from there. They're quite adamant about it, too (in a nice way - I just don't agree with it). I know it would be possible. I mean, it will add to the overall height of the floor (and I'd have to undercut the door, raise the toilet, etc.) which my girlfriend is fine with. I've explained everything to her very thoroughly. 

My main concern is in the integrity of the tile over time. With an uneven surface underneath, wouldn't that stress the tile and cause cracks years down the road? Or am I trying to do too much on something that doesn't need it? 

If needed, I'll try and snag some pictures later, but it won't be for 8+ hours. </TEXT>

Also, Berenstain or Berenstein?

Is that too many? The Berenstein question is the most important if it is.

<TEXT> Well, a couple things go into these being used. 

Exhibit A is karma. What works, works. I don't care who you are, if you're contributing on the main sub, you want upvotes.

Exhibit B, something you touched on, is the inability to use the cheap clickbait titles now. That was the big trend for a while, and now that those are banned, something new needed to take the spot. I'd also like to point out that I don't see these being nearly as bad as those other deceptive titles from before. Same vein, different blood. Or something.

Exhibit C. I'm just really, *really* tired today and I forgot if I had a third point. So yea. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *[To the tune of: The Little Drummer Boy]*


"Run!" They told me, "You need to run now!"     
"The Vile King's coming, we need to leave town!"       
"He will take everything! We need to run now!"       
"He will stop at nothing, don't look back now!  Don't look back now, don't look back now."     

 


"Don't you look at Him, or you will find death."       
"Here he comes."


"Little Baby, I'm sorry we stayed."       
"I have no legs to run, but I will hide you."       
"Please sir, I have no souls that I can give you."       
"Nothing fit for the King, I have nothing left.       
There's nothing left. There's nothing left."


"No, please, don't take him sir, he's my only son.       
My only son."


The King took him, to raise as his own.       
An heir to the Blood Throne and all of his lands.       
The boy hated him for what he had done.       
He had a plan for Him, a plan to end it,       
plan to end it, plan to end it.


How He smiled at me, to greet his demise.       
Me and my blade. </TEXT>

I became the Third, and she remained the Fifth. We did dances, slightly less elegant.

Then I was the Sixth, she still the Fifth. "Time heals all wounds." Time is what I clung to. Dances ceased. We started to sing curt phrases. 

Then I was the Ninth, and she became the Seventh. Finally, she danced again...in explosive, rigid movements, singing a song that fell on deaf ears.

"I can do better." I told myself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To say that I didn't love her would be massively incorrect. I loved her more than any other person could fathom. It's just...she slowly started treating me just like the others. That's why she had to die. Before you judge and hate me for that, allow me to explain myself. Please?

Heather and I met on April 2nd, 2013. It was a cold day, 42 degrees. Snow was still on the ground and eleven schools in the city had closed that day. I was outside smoking a Marlboro 27, watching the world operate. A grumpy, older man was shoveling his driveway so his wife's Prius could make it up the apron. He hated her. They screamed at each other almost every night except for weekends, when he would to Woody's Tavern and fuck the house hooker. It caught up to him at 7:51am when he collapsed at the base of his driveway. No clutching. No visible pain. I heard Heather running across the street from her porch less than eight seconds after. She yelled for someone to call 911. No one else was outside.

It took the EMS exactly one minute to arrive. During the sixty seconds leading up to that, I had run to be by Heather's side and assist in the situation. She didn't understand how the human body works like I do. He was still breathing, albeit shallow. He had a low pulse, also. After the 12:02 the paramedics took to secure the grumpy man and leave with him, I hung back to comfort Heather. She was clearly overwhelmed by the situation. As it turned out, she never saw a man go down like that before. 

The rest is history. 

We became engaged one year and eight days after that incident. I proposed in front of her fireplace while we played Scrabble. I didn't win, but I did. 

Our plan was to move in together *after* officially tying the knot as to keep a modicum of tradition alive. Well, that was her plan, at least. I disagreed, but since we lived only 977 feet away from each other I was able to make due with the arrangement. I must admit, it did heighten my paranoia. Heather was so perfect and trustworthy that I didn't act on it like I had in the past. Besides, I was able to see into her living room from my attic as long as she didn't close the blinds - which she never did. 

Honestly, the only thing that really irked me about her was her unwillingness to do anything with me on the weekends. She was always busy with work. Alternating schedules, you see. I worked forty hours, Monday through Friday as a consultant at a tech firm. She typically worked retail hours randomly throughout the week, and then late shifts on the weekends at Denny's. I don't like not seeing someone I care about.

When she told me she was pregnant though, my prayers were answered. Over the course of eight months, two weeks, and four days, Heather slowly began working less and less - aside from her weekend job. She actually picked up a few more hours at Denny's but I was fine with it since she was always home during the week. Balance. 

I wasn't home when she went into labor at 3:16pm on March 8th. The wife to the grumpy old man saw Heather writhing in contraction pain on her porch and rushed to her aide. They made their way to the hospital as I hurried home to grab the baby bag we had prepared. 

The grumpy old man stopped me as I was leaving.

"Get a test done!" He yelled as he waddled across the street. "You'll regret it if you don't!" 

I stopped. Out of anger mostly, but also curiosity. It's not everyday someone tells you take a paternity test as your child is being born. 

"Woody's," he panted, "every weekend. She's popular." He didn't need to explain any further. I stared at him silently.

"I've been there. Anyone at the bar can prove it." 

That was enough for me. There had been four rumors before, but nothing substantial. I saved this man's life before, and I didn't see a reason for him to lie to me. I got in my car, but before I pulled out he knocked on my window. 

"Sorry. My wife...she isn't the best." He apologized as he motioned to his house.

"I'll deal with it." I sped off to the hospital. 

Heather didn't immediately go into labor - her cervix wasn't dilated enough - they had her staged in the room ready for the moment, however. She was too doped up to notice I was next to her. The problem with hospitals is that things often go wrong. Pumps malfunction and can disperse too many milligrams of a certain medication. Plugs can be tripped on in a panic, causing machines with alarms to cease making noise. When things like that happen, people fall into a bad place that's hard to recover from. When things like that happen to pregnant women, doctors might have to perform an emergency C-Section to save the baby's life before the mother dies. Usually only one can be saved. Usually the child. 

6:31pm, he was harvested from Heather's lifeless husk. 7 lbs. 7 oz. 21 inches long. I took comfort that he was dark-skinned since we lived in a city that was 88% white, and lived in an all-white development. I decided on the name Noah - Heather always loved that name. 

I was investigated and found guilty of some bullshit negligence charge causing my wife to perish. My lawyer was damn good, though. I served no time due to my clean record. 180 days of probation were all I had to serve. I was okay with that. 

Now that that's all settled, I need to find you.

You're next.

<TEXT> "It isn't that I don't love you. I truly do with all of my heart. You're the chocolate cake to my fat stomach. I've realized that I'm simply not good enough for you - that's all. You can do better. I've been continually dragging you down for over a year now, and you don't deserve to deal with that any longer.

Honestly, I'm more of a burden to everyone and everything than I am a help. I'm a foul creature. Everything about me is false, frail, and ready to collapse. When was the last time I did something truly good to benefit anyone? I'm a pity party. I can't function alone. Hell, if it wasn't for you I might not be here today. I'm a waste.

Tell my boy I love him."

**Officer Notes:** *"Victim was found in the upstairs bathroom of the home. Girlfriend returned from vacation and experienced a strong odor upon opening the door. During her exploration to find source of smell, she found Mr. Davids in a clawfoot tub slightly decomposed. Cause of death was apparent suicide by self-inflicted bilateral wounds to the wrists."* </TEXT>

What helps me is writing in different subs. I'll dabble in some of the subs that have shorter word count requirements specifically. I find that even churning out a short 100-500 words is enough to help me bounce back creatively. 

I also have this problem where I get very bored doing the same thing repeatedly. So YMMV. Variety is worth a try! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Carving objects out of wood has always been a hobby of mine. Okay, not *always* - I picked it up after I started therapy. The sweet lady recommended that I find something creative that could keep my hands busy. 

*"Idle hands are the Devil's playthings."*

That was definitely one way to look at it. Regardless, it worked fine for a while. I would spend hours a day carving little spoons, people, and other cute objects. Fun. 

I got cocky, though, and stopped wearing my gloves. Of course I slipped and sliced the tip of my finger off. Hurt like a son-of-a-bitch. I don't like being in pain. It...irritates me. I went to that sweet lady's house and blamed her for my injury as my blood poured all over her carpets. She cried and tried to cradle me in an effort to calm my irritations but it wasn't enough. After all of the years of the same technique I had built up an immunity. I took my carving knife and cleanly sliced off her fingertip to replace my own. No effort - those blades are mighty sharp. Very...sharp. Sharp enough to carve ivory, I realized. 

I sell my carvings now. Ivory fetches a high price. More than wood ever could have.

Sorry, mama. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sunday, the first one of May. I got a phone call from the hospital around ten in the morning - my daughter had a severe seizure. Her roommate found her unconscious less than thirty minutes later, luckily. 

She wasn't epileptic, but has had a history of episodes starting not long after she starting dating that Kevin boy. He's had a history of seizures as well. I don't believe he's epileptic either. I doubt it's contagious.

The doctor told me that the only reason she didn't die was the memory foam bath mat that her head landed on, preventing it from cracking. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My father was tough. Strong. A manly man playing into the stereotype. Six-foot-five and built like an athlete, he protected all of his children from the invaders with ease. We all loved him dearly, and he loved us. Not just because of his protection. He showed us more kindness and compassion than any of our parents ever had. He wasn't willing to let us go.

That's how I imagined him being, at least. The truth is, I never met my dad. My mom was drugged and raped at a seedy downtown bar by a man with red hair. She woke up alone the next morning in a motel room in some town almost a hundred miles away from home. On the pillow next to her was a note that read:

*"I'm always watching. Waiting. Don't talk or I'll take everything."*

Understandably, she didn't go to the police. I can't exactly blame her for that. She was still loopy from the drugs and in an area that she had never been before with no idea how to get home. All she knew was that there was a death threat sitting next to her. No inclination as to how serious it was. 

She didn't talk. She didn't even go home. My mom ran away from it all and moved to Chicago. There, she tried to escape her problems and create a new life for herself surrounded by new people and new experiences. Nothing to remind her of what happened that night downtown. Aside from the occasional phone call home, my mom didn't exist in Ohio anymore.

After a couple of months, she began getting sick. Violently sick. To the point where she had no choice but to return home and get help. She hadn't managed to establish the life she wanted with her part-time server job at Denny's. My grandparents...they weren't exactly warm when they picked her up from the bus station. According to my mom, the word "disowned" was tossed around more than a few times. Knowing my grandparents they probably would have done it too - if she wasn't pregnant with me. 

By all accounts, the nine months she carried me were the one of the worst pregnancies anyone - including doctors - had ever seen. So bad, in fact, that every medical professional and even my *grandparents* shoved the option of abortion down my mom's throat. They all said she would die if she didn't get rid of me....obviously, that wasn't the case. I've been here for twenty-five years and my mom, twice as long. 

The doctors blamed every single mishap I had on my mom's decision to keep me. 

Lead poisoning? Bad kidney filtering. A normal kid could deal with the lead paint levels in our apartment. 

Asthma? Weak lungs. Genetics wouldn't affect my predisposition.

Night terrors? Poor brain development. I should have been able to rationalize that there wasn't a monster in my closet or under my bed.

Whatever I went through, if it wasn't perfect, it was my mom's fault for having me. It hurt. Even as a kid. I wanted nothing more than to make my mom proud. That's why I didn't tell anyone about the black man until I was almost fourteen. She didn't need to deal with any more of my "faults."

Deep down, part of me actually believed that my brain didn't work properly and that I was imagining it all. Logically, I felt like it didn't make any sense that a man could be living in my room. How could he eat? I wasn't allowed to bring food into my room. It never smelled - he had to go to the bathroom somehow, and wash himself. It didn't help that every time my mom would come check on me that he would vanish instantly in a plume of black mist. A real person couldn't do that. No one in the world was quick enough to go from my bedside to my closet that fast. I *had* to be making it up. 

Even deeper, though, fear kept me silent. Once my mom went to bed, black mist would pour through the keyhole in my closet door, filling my bedroom floor until it rose to a point next to my bed. The black man would sit on the edge of my bed, stroke my hair, and speak to me every night, for as long as I could remember. He was sincere in his grungy voice.

*"I'm just here to see you. Don't talk. I won't hurt, as long as you don't talk."*

He used the same opening statement every night as he sat down. Then he would sing lullabies just above a whisper. The classics. It was...soothing, in a way. My mom was always too tired to do things like that for me. It was always scary - even after hundreds of times. The black man just made me feel uneasy. I couldn't explain why. 

It was a few nights before my fourteenth birthday when I finally spoke up. I didn't mean to! I never thought anyone would believe me anyways. My mom was asking me what I wanted for my birthday and I asked for a camera for ghost hunting. She got a rise out of it, but when I told her I thought our house was haunted she went pale. She knew right away. 

After a long conversation about what I had been going through, my mom left the room and came back with a heavy, black leather book that had a silver inscription on it:

**Wer hat Angst vorm schwarzen Mann?**

It didn't click until she explained to me what really happened the night I was conceived. 

My mom was raped. That part was true. It was the customary way in which a new Vessel was impregnated. The act had to be done with consent of the female and her parents, at an undetermined time during her twenty-fifth year...by force. This process allowed the seed to be planted with hatred and evil, so the chosen child would come from the womb ready to be groomed into the Recipient. This tradition originated centuries ago and has been unchanged since. My mom tried to run away from it, and my family - to give me a chance, but the black man found her and punished her, forcing her to come home. That's when I finally understood. 

**schwarzen Mann...**

**Schwarz...Mann**

**Schwarzman** - my last name. The Black Man.

I was too discombobulated to freak out about the new information. My mom was in tears but I must have been in shock. I didn't know what else to do. I went to my room and locked myself in. 

Hours passed as I sat in my room writing my last name over and over again. I didn't notice that night had come until I heard a gunshot downstairs. I ran to my door to check on my mom but it wouldn't budge. I screamed and pounded on it, hoping my mom would come to the door like all of those nights she checked on me...nothing. 

The black mist began filling my floor as I kept thrashing against my door. I felt a hand grab my wrist and I was pulled down to the floor. The mist swarmed around, covering me like a blanket as the Black Man pulled me under my bed. I tried pulling back. I wanted to fight. The best I was able to do was slow my inevitable descent into the darkness. 

The Black Man's face appeared in front of me - wispy blackness and piercing white eyes. He roared every time I pulled away from him, making the mist burn my skin at each tug. The lullabies he used to sing to me were blaring inside of my head. I didn't hear my door break down. My mom grabbed my legs and pulled on me using her body weight as leverage. I became a rope in a tug-of-war game. The mist around me formed into a hand with sharp fingers and the Black Man sunk his claws into my arm. It didn't cause me pain. He wasn't trying to hurt me, he was trying to infect me. My skin started turned gray and then black and flashes of white started eclipsing my sight. He wasn't willing to let me go. My mom didn't give up. She continued pulling my legs harder and harder...and harder. A pain unlike anything I had felt before radiated through my entire body from my shoulder as I went flying back into my mom's lap. Raspy, angry, whispers overtook the air as the Black Man formed in front of us from the mist. 

"I told you not to talk." Was all I could hear as he stood in front of us, staring into our souls with his empty white eyes. I couldn't move from the pain...my arm was torn clean off of my body and little by little I lost my ability to keep my eyes open. My mom, somehow, flicked on my bedroom light and everything vanished. It was done. My last clear memory is wishing she did that before.

It's been just over ten years. My mom is still alive and kicking, as am I. The Black Man hasn't come to bother me since that night, but according to the book my turn comes on my 29th birthday. 

He'llbe back.

*"I'm just here to see you. Don't talk. I won't hurt, as long as you don't talk."*

He used the same opening statement every night as he sat down. Then he would sing lullabies just above a whisper. The classics. It was...soothing, in a way. My mom was always too tired to do things like that for me. It was always scary - even after hundreds of times. The black man just made me feel uneasy. I couldn't explain why. 

It was a few nights before my fourteenth birthday when I finally spoke up. I didn't mean to! I never thought anyone would believe me anyways. My mom was asking me what I wanted for my birthday and I asked for a camera for ghost hunting. She got a rise out of it, but when I told her I thought our house was haunted she went pale. She knew right away. 

After a long conversation about what I had been going through, my mom left the room and came back with a heavy, black leather book that had a silver inscription on it:

**Wer hat Angst vorm schwarzen Mann?**

It didn't click until she explained to me what really happened the night I was conceived. 

My mom was raped. That part was true. It was the customary way in which a new Vessel was impregnated. The act had to be done with consent of the female and her parents, at an undetermined time during her twenty-fifth year...by force. This process allowed the seed to be planted with hatred and evil, so the chosen child would come from the womb ready to be groomed into the Recipient. This tradition originated centuries ago and has been unchanged since. My mom tried to run away from it, and my family - to give me a chance, but the black man found her and punished her, forcing her to come home. That's when I finally understood. 

**schwarzen Mann...**

**Schwarz...Mann**

**Schwarzman** - my last name. The Black Man.

I was too discombobulated to freak out about the new information. My mom was in tears but I must have been in shock. I didn't know what else to do. I went to my room and locked myself in. 

Hours passed as I sat in my room writing my last name over and over again. I didn't notice that night had come until I heard a gunshot downstairs. I ran to my door to check on my mom but it wouldn't budge. I screamed and pounded on it, hoping my mom would come to the door like all of those nights she checked on me...nothing. 

The black mist began filling my floor as I kept thrashing against my door. I felt a hand grab my wrist and I was pulled down to the floor. The mist swarmed around, covering me like a blanket as the Black Man pulled me under my bed. I tried pulling back. I wanted to fight. The best I was able to do was slow my inevitable descent into the darkness. 

The Black Man's face appeared in front of me - wispy blackness and piercing white eyes. He roared every time I pulled away from him, making the mist burn my skin at each tug. The lullabies he used to sing to me were blaring inside of my head. I didn't hear my door break down. My mom grabbed my legs and pulled on me using her body weight as leverage. I became a rope in a tug-of-war game. The mist around me formed into a hand with sharp fingers and the Black Man sunk his claws into my arm. It didn't cause me pain. He wasn't trying to hurt me, he was trying to infect me. My skin started turned gray and then black and flashes of white started eclipsing my sight. He wasn't willing to let me go. My mom didn't give up. She continued pulling my legs harder and harder...and harder. A pain unlike anything I had felt before radiated through my entire body from my shoulder as I went flying back into my mom's lap. Raspy, angry, whispers overtook the air as the Black Man formed in front of us from the mist. 

"I told you not to talk." Was all I could hear as he stood in front of us, staring into our souls with his empty white eyes. I couldn't move from the pain...my arm was torn clean off of my body and little by little I lost my ability to keep my eyes open. My mom, somehow, flicked on my bedroom light and everything vanished. It was done. My last clear memory is wishing she did that before.

It's been just over ten years. My mom is still alive and kicking, as am I. The Black Man hasn't come to bother me since that night, but according to the book my turn comes on my 29th birthday.

<TITLE> Chocoholic </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-29 19:15:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I spent almost four months looking for Otto.

He went missing shortly after the old chocolate factory began operating again. Allegedly - according to the reports, at least - there was an "incident" during a tour of the factory he went on. He fell into a stream of highly viscous chocolate, and was taken down to a separate part of the factory by the undertow. That was when my first bit of suspicion arose. It's a common misconception that a rip current can drag someone under water and down a stream. It doesn't work that way. 

Otto was retrieved by some factory workers in a separate room from where the incident occurred. Besides being covered in liquid gold, he appeared to be in perfect health. His mother verified this, as did the medical centre she took him to immediately after. Aside from being shaken up, Otto reportedly continued on with life as normal - even eating chocolate on a daily basis as he did prior to the tour.

My investigation wasn't into the incident, however. His mother squared that away with the CEO of the company not long after it happened. My involvement in the situation came after Otto went missing a month later.

His mother phoned the police first, who didn't take her claims seriously. Her reasoning that something was wrong was based on the lack of chocolate bar wrappers in his bed. I'll admit, when she came pounding on my office door yelling, "Help! There's no wrappers! My boy!" I also had a hard time taking her seriously. Money is money, though, so I let her into my office.

After an eternity of sobbing and giving unopened chocolate bars to me to examine, she was finally able to tell me all of the details of the incident and his behaviour since the occurrence, leading up to his disappearance.

According to Otto's mother, he began acting strange about a week after returning home from the tour of the factory. His chocolate intake almost tripled, and Otto needed chocolate bar every time of day. He would wake up in the middle of the night, sweating and screaming that he needed a chocolate bar immediately. Why she didn't see this as strange I never fully understood. He started skipping school roughly one week before he disappeared, but was always found behind the local candy shop scavenging through the waste bins looking for discarded chocolate bits. Again, I'll never understand why she didn't take him to a doctor. Part of me feels that she would let him eat so she didn't have to deal with tantrums. Opinions don't solve investigations, however.

I took the job. Mostly out of curiosity, although I won't deny that the hefty reward she was offering for an easy case swayed me a tad. While she might have been unable to accept it, at that time it was obvious to me that Otto had to be attempting to return to the factory. The job was only a matter of finding him along the way. It didn't sound difficult. They lived one country over and shared a land border with the city the factory was in. For a child of nine, the task wasn't exactly an impossibility. It was a day trip by train, two or three by car, and probably not much more by hitchhiking.

1.800 up front. 2.200 upon retrieval. And all I had to do was track his scent like a hound.

I should correct myself here, before I get too far. 

I did not spend almost four months looking for Otto. I found him within two week's time. The remainder of that period was spent attempting to infiltrate the factory to find him and rescue him. 

According to my sources, Otto made it to the factory approximately six days after he left home. They never attempted to contact his mother. 

Until a few days ago, I was unable to confirm visuals - it was all conjecture. The factory is highly guarded. It's probably closer to a castle than an actual factory. There's a gargantuan wrought-iron gate that surrounds the entire premises - easily taller than two men. Brown German Shepherds that freely roam the grounds. Guards that cover every one hundred feet, standing stoic as if they were members of the Queen's Guard. It took me the brunt of the past few months surveying the grounds every day to formulate a plan of action. The place is a goddamn fortress. One might think it's the vacation home to royalty. 

Getting inside wasn't the most honorable of tasks, but it needed to be done. The guards *never* changed shifts. The dogs *never* went indoors. I...I hate to admit this, but I have to: I went through...the septic tank. It was left unguarded underground, with about half of it exposed to the sewers. Yes, it was disgusting. I don't think the smell will ever cease to haunt me. There were no other options. I crawled through those pipes, almost getting stuck a few times along the way. Luckily, no flushes happened. I came through a large manhole in the floor under what appeared to be a series of tubes that chocolate was flowing through. The area was small, but just big enough for me to crawl through on my hands and knees - had I been a little person there's a chance that I could have walked, I guess.

I crawled under the tubes for quite some time, until they rose up and a ledge leading down to a cold, stone hallway appeared. I checked for guards - nothing. It was deserted, and I was in luck. After a minute of walking down that hallway I came to a heavily beaten door that read:

**Aut....rized P..rso....el**   
**W..nki..es Only**

Jackpot. At least, I hoped it was.

I jimmied the lock in the handle and slowly cracked open the door. A smell overtook me. Worse than the filthy waste water covering my body. It was flesh, rotting flesh and...chocolate. Not the pleasant chocolate smell I was used to. This was spoiled milk, with cacao mixed into it. My entire body began convulsing as I gagged. I didn't want to go in. I pondered it as I heaved. Was the 4.000 worth whatever I was going to witness? 

Yes. Yes, it was. 

I opened the door wide enough to squeeze my body through. It was dark, but not entirely blacked out. It was akin to a bedroom with a nightlight. I had to wrap my dirty shirt around my face to be able to stand the smell. There were spotless metal tables lining the walls of the room, along with shelves full of tools and empty cages. Along a huge, empty wall was a table filled with computers and paperwork. I went there first to search for answers. 

`Supply Chain Four`   
`Status: Low`   
`Action Required: Fill`   
`Please press "Enter" to initiate replenishment sequence`

Those were the only words on the screen, with "Enter" blinking in bold, blue letters. I could toggle out of the screen, nor cancel the status inquiry. So I did what I had to do and initiated the replenishment.

The wall behind the computers illuminated in a blinding fluorescent white light as the turning of gears and machinery overtook the room. The first thing I noticed was the crane moving down an overhead track carrying a net full of blue and green striped spherical fruits. They weren't anything I had ever seen before. As I followed the crane with my eyes it led to an area that was sectioned off by fencing with barbed wire across its top. Bursting out of that fencing was Otto...or something that resembled him. It was a lumpy blob of white skin, covered in purple stretch marks and deep red cracks. The was some sort of mouth on top of the flesh mound that was being kept in a gaping open position by some sort of forceps. As the crane lowered itself into position just over the creature's mouth, it grunted repeatedly in approval over the meal it was about to be given - like a baby bird when it's mother returns with a worm. The fencing began shaking violently, and a bunch of little men ran into the area from panels in the walls, stabbing the blob with some sort of electrical rods. It stopped moving.

The crane released the net, and dozens of those strange coloured fruits fell into it's mouth. The ones that fell were tossed up and into it's mouth by some of the smaller men without electric rods. A machine wheeled into the the area and a tube emerged from the front of it, facing the front of the fenced area. The men opened the side of the fence and the machine extended the tube straight into a fold in the blob's center. It let out a cry of pain as a brown sludge sloshed it's way down the pipe to the machine.

"Otto. He loves chocolate so much, he was eager to take a job here." A voice pierced through the drone of machinery. I jumped and looked behind me, but there was no one in the room. I ran for it. Back through the door. Up the ledge. Back through the manhole cover and out to the sewers. I made it back to my hotel faster than any taxi could have gotten me there.

I have no idea how to inform his mother of what's happened to her son. I don't really know what to do myself, honestly. Every morning there's a delicious chocolate bar sitting on my pillow. They know what I've done. They know where I am. I know I shouldn't be eating the chocolate. I know it's a message. It's just so good. </TEXT>

Those were the only words on the screen, with "Enter" blinking in bold, blue letters. I could toggle out of the screen, nor cancel the status inquiry. So I did what I had to do and initiated the replenishment.

The wall behind the computers illuminated in a blinding fluorescent white light as the turning of gears and machinery overtook the room. The first thing I noticed was the crane moving down an overhead track carrying a net full of blue and green striped spherical fruits. They weren't anything I had ever seen before. As I followed the crane with my eyes it led to an area that was sectioned off by fencing with barbed wire across its top. Bursting out of that fencing was Otto...or something that resembled him. It was a lumpy blob of white skin, covered in purple stretch marks and deep red cracks. The was some sort of mouth on top of the flesh mound that was being kept in a gaping open position by some sort of forceps. As the crane lowered itself into position just over the creature's mouth, it grunted repeatedly in approval over the meal it was about to be given - like a baby bird when it's mother returns with a worm. The fencing began shaking violently, and a bunch of little men ran into the area from panels in the walls, stabbing the blob with some sort of electrical rods. It stopped moving.

The crane released the net, and dozens of those strange coloured fruits fell into it's mouth. The ones that fell were tossed up and into it's mouth by some of the smaller men without electric rods. A machine wheeled into the the area and a tube emerged from the front of it, facing the front of the fenced area. The men opened the side of the fence and the machine extended the tube straight into a fold in the blob's center. It let out a cry of pain as a brown sludge sloshed it's way down the pipe to the machine.

"Otto. He loves chocolate so much, he was eager to take a job here." A voice pierced through the drone of machinery. I jumped and looked behind me, but there was no one in the room. I ran for it. Back through the door. Up the ledge. Back through the manhole cover and out to the sewers. I made it back to my hotel faster than any taxi could have gotten me there.

I have no idea how to inform his mother of what's happened to her son. I don't really know what to do myself, honestly. Every morning there's a delicious chocolate bar sitting on my pillow. They know what I've done. They know where I am. I know I shouldn't be eating the chocolate. I know it's a message. It's just so [good.](http://www.reddit.com/r/subject1780) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here to help!

First things first: your story is a tad bit shy of the /r/nosleep word requirements. You must have at least 500 words to a story, and I have you at 493. But that won't matter by the end of this ;)

I have very little time left, and I know it. I have been getting... visited, so to speak, from my son every single night. He's five, so you might be thinking this is a sweet story, but you would be wrong. It started when he was around 3. My wife heard this strange clicking noise in the middle of the night, and she sent me to investigate as anyone would do in her position. She was a mother, and she had raised three children... she needed her sleep, and I was ever willing to provide her with this one simple luxury. I was the one who got up in the middle of the night now whenever anyone needed help. It shouldn't have been this way. A boy needs his mother, and it should have been her. The clicking noise was mine to investigate, though, so there I was searching the house for the source. It took a few minutes to realize the sound was coming from his room.

**Good way to establish a setting in a shorter story. No need for unnecessary build-up or background. Simply "this is who am I and this is happening." Personally, saying a child needs their mother as opposed to any parent rubbed me the wrong way, but I understand the logic and that I'm probably an outlier. Anyways. Short and sweet. It can work.**

I found him standing up, motionless. The clicking noise was coming from his mouth. He was chewing something. I walked up to him slowly and gently, so as not to frighten him. I got down on my left knee and began to reach over to touch his shoulder when it hit me. When I walked into the room I had focused directly on this child in the corner, but now that I was closer, there was someone in the bed. Someone small. It was my son... I just knew it.

**I would begin this paragraph with some adjectives to establish the scenery. Describe the room. Were you nervous? Also, state that he was in the corner early on. I didn't understand it in my first reading. I had assumed you went to his bed/crib. To end it, maybe you can say that you picked him up to put him in bed and saw a child already in his bed. Or something. I think you can understand my point.**

I must be dreaming, I thought... obviously this can't be real. I got the sudden sensation that I should not take my eyes off this other one. Why was I here again? The clicking noise. Jesus that noise... what is he chewing?
I put my hand on this other boy who is also my son, and he turned to me with a face that destroyed me. I have never seen someone smile like that. This was my son alright... he was a smiley happy kid, but this was different. It's what was IN his mouth that destroyed me. He was chewing a finger... his own finger. The clicking noise was the sound of his own bones breaking as he gnawed on them.

**Tense is a little odd to me in the first sentence. Maybe try "I thought I was dreaming. This obviously wasn't real." Avoid the word "sudden" and just say what you felt. Also, when you're telling a story in past tense you don't want to interject your thoughts as if you were experiencing them in the present. It throws the flow off.**

Now I looked at the boy in the bed. THIS was my son... but the bed was bloody, right near his finger. I scream and then I'm waking up in bed to my son crying hysterically next to me. He's screaming more than anything... he had a nightmare about a boy biting him.

**I mean. Solid, basically. Just tensing issues.**

Every night has been this way. Every night my wife wakes me up and I go into his room and find the boy chewing a new body part. Every night, my son comes into my room to tell me about the nightmare.
For the past week, though, he no longer wakes me up screaming. He just stands there counting my fingers.

**"Every night has been this way since then."**

Overall, solid premise and creepy idea. If you're aiming for a short, creepy story I believe this is all you would need to nail it. If you wanted to expand this into a longer, terrifying story it might take a lot more in terms of building suspense and describing scenes. I think it's best as it is though, minus the few things I pointed out.

<TEXT> My Aunt Rose was such a drag. Honestly! I always despised going to her house for holidays. Her attitude towards us "kids" (the youngest being 17 years, 3 months, and 18 days old at the time of the events detailed in this letter) was nothing short of condescending, and she made a point to be judgmental of the adults. None of us liked going there, but our family was stuck in a unique position - Aunt Rose was well-off due to her $216,884.13 annual salary, making her the only one capable of hosting a holiday. We all had no choice but to grin and bear it or risk not having a proper holiday. 

Now, don't get me wrong. While my Aunt Rose was the single ugliest, most detestable creature on the inside, her beauty could not be argued...post-divorce. When my Uncle Mark left her on November 3rd, 2006 for a significantly more pleasant woman named Angelica, my aunt went off of the deep end. 

Thomas Carlyle once said: "the greatest of faults is to be conscious of none." Aunt Rose suffered from the greatest of faults. She managed to avoid the realization that being around her for more than twenty-four minutes could drive a Navy Seal to madness. No. She became obsessed with vanity - blaming Angelica being young and beautiful as the reason Uncle Mark left her. She scheduled her first surgery for May 11th, 2007 - exactly one month before the divorce was to be finalized. 

It began with facial reconstruction. Then lip implants. Nip, tuck. Nip, tuck. Liposuction. Aunt Rose always had rather large, 32D breasts but she wasted no time getting them "perked-up" as well.

$86,010.00 accompanied by two years, one month, and six days and Aunt Rose was a new woman. A "young" woman, with a body that could rival any aging pornstar...and she knew it. 

It was the Thanksgiving of 2011 that ended my family's disdain for holiday gatherings. 

Aunt Rose - since her surgeries - didn't attempt to hide her promiscuity. She also became a master of introductions. My aunt brought a new date to every gathering she hosted or attended. In 2011, unfortunately, it was Charles. 

When we arrived on the early evening of Thanksgiving, Charles was posted at the door ready to greet us and take our coats, bags, and food trays. He was a handsome, older man (54.5) - clean shaven with salt and peppered hair and piercing blue eyes. He donned a stunning brown bespoke suit and a sharp blue tie that almost matched his eyes. Much to my family's surprise, Charles seemed like a good catch for Aunt Rose. He was pleasant, well-spoken, and appeared to match my aunt's lifestyle in every possible way.

It took one hour and twelve minutes after my sister and I arrived for dinner to be served. A little longer than the usual wait time from previous years because Aunt Rose wanted to show-off her new boy toy. As the cooks brought out the trays for dinner, my sister made the mistake of getting up to go to the restroom, causing one cook to drop a tray full of sweet potatoes that were topped with roasted pecans and brown sugar. It went everywhere. 

"Sit in your place you filthy nigger!" Charles erupted as he leapt up and pointed to the chair my sister was in. 

My father, bless him, damn near flipped the table onto Charles in a fit of rage I hadn't seen since I was a boy. Amidst the screaming and arms swinging, my sister ran off to the bathroom in hysterics. It was 6:18pm. 

At 6:21pm, Aunt Rose ducked away from defending Charles to go check on my sister. For as terrible as she was, my aunt was no stranger to the effects of racism - especially on younger people. I followed suit at 6:22pm after taking an elbow to the neck while holding my dad back from being charged with manslaughter. 

It was now or never. This was inexcusable and needed to end.

My sister was alone when I made it to the bathroom. Still sobbing, but consolable. I assured her I would take care of everything as long as she stayed put. Aunt Rose was in her private bathroom. At 6:29pm, I shut off the main fuse. The house went dark. As my family temporarily contained their anger to look for candles and flashlights, I made my way to the private bathroom. Aunt Rose was sitting on the closed toilet, touching herself by candlelight. When I burst in, instead of shock...she asked me if I would like help. I accepted. She smiled.

I reached into my wallet and removed my plastic safety measures. Carfentanil. One milligram. It's an extremely potent elephant tranquilizer. So strong, in fact, that a flake as small as a grain of salt can kill a human when absorbed through the skin. I started carrying some with me after one person I know was killed, and they linked me as a suspect. It didn't look like an accident like it was supposed to. I was sloppy. This provided me with an easy out if there were any...mistakes.


As Aunt Rose seductively walked up to me and pressed her artificial naked body against my clothes, I grasped her jaw with my left hand and emptied the contents into her mouth with my right. 

"You want to drug me? *Kinky.*" She said as she sat back down and caressed her body. "Come fuck me."

I humored her. As I undid my belt and unbuttoned my shirt, she began gagging uncontrollably. I refastened my buttons and left. My job was done. I returned to my sister at 6:53pm. The light came back on at 6:57pm, when one of the cooks found the fuse box and returned the switches to their original states. When my sister and I returned to the dining room Charles had already excused himself. Dinner was ruined, but morale in the room was so strong you could feel it. My family accomplished something that night. We stood our ground. We didn't lay down because of Aunt Rose and her wealth. We became a new family that night. A unit, that didn't need the depths of a pocketbook to enjoy holidays. We all left and went to an Asian restaurant and feasted on the single best duck I've had in my entire life. 

Aunt Rose was found the next afternoon at 1:07pm by her evening housekeeper at the start of her shift. Apparently her African American cooks were not a fan of Charles and his slurs, and left not long after we did without even bothering with pay. Aunt Rose was purple. I wish she would have been red, just for the irony.

Holidays since that day in 2011 have been nothing short of fantastic. You'll enjoy them with us, I promise.

Our family is renewed.

Be Thankful,

<TEXT> We take life for granted. Every second, minute, hour, and day goes by on autopilot. We complain about the mundane lifestyles we live. We get upset that we follow the same routines week after week after week. We'll plan vacations - getaways from our normal lives in hopes that it will reignite the spark we once had for spontaneity and enjoyment. Then we'll get home and fall back into the same routines. Nothing changes. Rinse. Repeat. We hate it, yet we relish in the safety of normalcy. If everything stays the same, nothing bad happens. It's predictable. We know the cause and effect, the action and the reaction.

And then you lose someone.

My phone rang while I was at work, a little after returning from my lunch break. It was a number I didn't recognize. Typically, I tend to shy away from answering unknown numbers - old debts and such. This felt...different. I can't explain how. Maybe it was intuition. I answered. 

"Mr. Davis, this is Nurse Thomas from the Cleveland Clinic. There's been an incident with your wife. We require your presence here at the hospital as soon as you can get here."

Nothing can jumpstart a heart rate faster than an unexpected call from a hospital. The nurse assured me that my wife was alive and conscious, but couldn't release any more details until I was at the hospital. Those next few moments are gone from my mind forever. I suffer from semi-regular panic attacks and I'm used to the blind actions adrenaline can cause but...this wasn't typical. I can only assume I started bawling, as my first clear memory after that phone call was sitting on the floor surrounded by my coworkers and some concerned customers. I managed to drive myself twenty minutes to the hospital, although I'm honestly not sure how. 

Intensive Care Unit, Room 2125. 

My wife was laying there on a hospital bed hooked up to more machines and intravenous lines than any one person should be. Her neck was a gradient of purples and reds that was either making its way up to her sweaty, pale-green face or receding from it. It didn't matter to me. I gave her a kiss on the forehead and a whisper of love. 

"Mr. Davis, may I speak with you in private?" Nurse Thomas quietly said to me with a hand on my back. 

"Your wife has a severe systemic infection, caused by a lodged kidney stone. Her kidneys have been failing rapidly and without emergency surgery...it doesn't look promising." 

I've never understood how someone could willingly take on a career that involves informing people that their loved ones are going to die.

"Well perform the surgery! What are you waiting on me for?" I yelled at her, releasing some of my inner angst. She didn't deserve it.

"Your wife needs a new kidney. Today. They have both dipped below 30% functionality. Without a new one, her body won't be able to filter out the infection. We would normally attempt to fully stabilize a patient first but...well, I'm sure you can understand the urgency of the situation."

"How long is the wait on the donor list?" 

"There isn't. We need a live donor." Her sympathy was genuine. I wasn't expecting it from someone in this profession. "Are you willing to be tested as a match for your wife?"

Life paused. 

When I woke up that morning I made myself two pieces of toast with melted butter and strawberry jelly - my go-to breakfast on the days I worked. I ran my Keurig to fill my travel mug with coffee as I took a five minute shower and groomed myself for the work day. I picked out a plain, subtle red tie and tied it into a trinity knot in an attempt to make more of a bold statement at work. Maybe garner some attention from my boss. I mixed my cream and sugar into the coffee. I let the dogs out and fed them breakfast - 3/4 cup dry for one, 1/4 cup with a little water for the other. I set the plates and bowls out on the table for the kids' breakfast, and put two different cereals on the counter for them to choose from. I went to work, but right before I left I turned on the lamp so our youngest wouldn't be afraid of the dark. My wife slept the whole time, as she normally would. 

Was I willing to immediately undergo surgery and give up one of my kidneys to save my wife? Could I live without it? Could I live without her? 

What about the kids? How would they deal without having a mom? What if one of them needed a kidney one day? I certainly wouldn't be able to donate one. 

I imagined my life without my wife there.

"Mr. Davis? Mr. Davis is everything okay? Would you like to sit down?" Life unpaused.

"Sorry. It-it's just a lot to take in. Can I think about it for a few?" Her wince answered my question for me. "I...I can't do it. I can't take that risk of anything happening to both of us. We have kids! Dogs! I'm sorry-"

"Sir, if you are a match and you refuse to donate you're signing your wife's death certificate." A doctor interrupted me as he walked to us from down the hall. "That's something you have to live with. It's one thing if you aren't a match, but if you are...well, I believe the results here are clear." 

"I can't do it. Isn't there another option? Maybe her brother or someone?" 

"Mr. Davis, you're here *now* and we need to perform the surgery *now.* We can attempt to find an alternative, hell, one that might even have a better chance of being a match. But we can test you now, while we reach out to relatives. *Time is vital right now,* Mr. Davis. We need to act, and we need to act fast."

"I'm sorry...I just-"

"She will die without a kidney! Do you not understand the situation here?! Dammit!" His anger oozed out of his pores as he threw his clipboard on the floor. "Thomas, get a list of her kin together and make those phone calls. Mr. Davis, I would suggest you have a long talk with your wife." He walked off. I could feel the disgust from the onlookers.

I went to my wife's room where I found her with eyes wide open and some tears streaming down her cheeks. She didn't need to tell me she heard everything. The purples and reds were spreading up her cheeks and her eyes were slightly milky and yellow. She was a victim of poisoning and her body was the assassin.

"I know why-" she forced out between breaths, "you don't want to do it." 

"Babe, what if something happened?" I was shaking, crying on the inside, but I held it together as best I could for her. 

"Don't worry about it. I'll be fine. I love you." 

"I love you too. I do. I do so much." 

She closed her eyes and that was it. Those were the last words I ever exchanged with my wife.

Her brother also refused to donate, although he at least came to get tested. It was his cold feet after finding out he could do it that made him back down. He blamed me for her death. The kids weren't old enough to fully grasp what's going on, but I felt their resentment as well. Life was no longer the same, and it never would be again.

I booked a vacation for the kids and I a couple months after her passing. A nice, little getaway from the shakeup and the reminders of their mother. Nothing spectacular - just a trip down south to Columbus for the weekend. Maybe create a few smiles and laughs before we went back to the gloom and stagnation of real life. 

The first night in the hotel, around 12:30am., is when I heard the first scream. A high-pitched squeal that woke me up. I ran to the kids and they were fast asleep. I searched all of the rooms. Turned on lights. Opened closets. It was just the three of us. I assumed it must have been an issue in a room down the hall and that as long as it didn't come to our door, I wasn't going to stress myself out. I went back to bed.

As I laid there on my back, staring into the eternity of the ceiling, something started moving. Forming, rather. A black, swirling mist was permeating the space above me as food coloring would when dropped into water. It grew. As it kept gaining mass, it slowly solidified into pieces - body parts made from darkness. 

The screaming began again.

"You let me die you fuck!" I recognized the voice immediately.

"Where are my babies?! You took them from me!"

One voice was becoming multiple as the screams grew more intense and vengeful. It wasn't just my wife yelling at me as she often did. 

The pieces came together. My wife was above me, staring down into my being with bloodstained eyes peering out behind her black eyelids. 

"You let me die. You filthy, pathetic excuse for a man. Lieutenant Angle wouldn't have let me die. He *always* took care of me." She snarled. Our marriage wasn't perfect, but I let the affair slide. She was looking to shake things up. She needed excitement. I loved her. I understood.

"Pervert! Pervert! Pervert! Pervert!" She screamed again, pointing towards my groin. "You're going to Hell for that one!" She laughed. I let the affair slide, but I must admit, my wife wasn't the only one who needed a getaway. 

"Stop!" I yelled back on the verge of an emotional breakdown. I closed my eyes and covered my ears, but her screams of "bastard" and "killer" seemed to stem from inside my head. 

Then it all stopped.

I ran and checked on the kids - asleep. Room was still empty. I rushed into the hallway - empty. I sat on the couch and watched the news until the kids woke up in the morning. 

We went to the malls. The Lego Store. All of the fun little eateries and some really great restaurants. 

My wife was the woman in a blue dress in the crowded mall. 

My wife rang us out at the Lego Store. 

My wife served us pizza and sighed when she brought the check, knowing her tip would be small.

I don't know if the kids see her. My little girl has woken up a few times laughing at the darkness. When I've asked her who she's talking to, she just tells me not to worry because Lieutenant Angle will keep her safe. I've petitioned the courts for a paternity test.

<TEXT> My obsession with being warm started 8.3 years ago, when I was living in a rundown studio apartment. It was a rodent's nest, surrounded by eleven other equally disgusting dens. My neighbors were cretins - all fifteen of them - and the slumlord was no better. 

Lisa was, by all accounts, a whore who only owned my building to have a safe haven to turn tricks. In the thirteen months I resided there the police came nineteen times and arrested exactly *zero* people. Zero. She knew her way around the law, and this apartment complex was her "get out of jail free" card. It's hard to imagine the police weren't keeping tabs on her, waiting to pounce on the slightest slip-up. Too bad she got away.

Personally, I never had any issues or concerns with the apartment building or my fifteen co-inhibitors. They kept to themselves. I kept to myself. Tawnya, the resident dumpster, asked me to sleep with her on eight separate occasions but other than that I was essentially a ghost. Well, a ghost to all but Lisa. I can't imagine what it was, but she was drawn to me by something. A lust created by my mystery and isolation, perhaps?

Lisa would come to the building twice a week - 11:30 a.m. on Tuesdays, and 4:30 p.m. on Fridays. She was never late, like a good business woman. I was always her first stop on Tuesdays and her last stop on Fridays. 

Tuesdays were great. Her usual arrival time - when I would hear the knock on my door - was approximately 11:37 a.m. (11:36 a.m. if we're talking means). She would greet me with a large hug, squeezing me so tightly that I'm surprised her breasts never ruptured. We would chat for between six and eleven minutes about how I'm doing and if I had any fun plans coming up, and she would fill me in on anything I needed to know involving the building. Great. Curt, brief, and professional. 

Fridays, however, defined the word "juxtaposition" for me. The knocking on Fridays varied wildly. I can't confidently confirm any approximate times, which made it hard to plan around her. Some Fridays she would be at my door by 5:05 p.m., whereas other days she would show up as late at 7:44 p.m.. Madness. Her visits lacked all semblance of professionality. Lisa would always wear a tank top with no bra, letting loose her bolted-on nipples regardless of weather conditions. She would caress my door frame while speaking in a rehearsed sensual tone, asking if I "needed anything." I didn't. I would have left if it wasn't for my *lovely* annual income of $21,318.42. 

Given my lack of options, I tolerated the situation for as long as I could. Until my heat stopped working on February 18th. 

Lisa, in her infinite kindness and obsession with me, was more than happy to fix the issue - if I had sex with her. Needless to say, I declined. Her visits stopped, and my apartment grew colder and colder by the day. 

I wasn't willing to give into her. 

I took my issues to the city council, who directed me to the housing board. I was promised on March 4th that they would resolve the matter no later than March 11th. A week was less satisfactory than I had hoped for, but I wasn't in a position to barter. 

March 11th - nothing.

March 12th - nothing.

March 15th - nothing.

My patience was diminishing significantly faster than the temperature. Too many calls unanswered. Too many questions ignored and deflected. Lisa had a hold on me, all because she wanted to hold me. 

March 17th, a Friday. Some know it as St. Patrick's Day. I know it as the holiday that usurps my birthday plans every year. It was also the day I decided to take matters into my own hands. 

Lisa came to the building at her usual 4:30 p.m. time, darting quickly between tenants in order to avoid my notice. *Fault number one*. In her haste, she had neglected to notice that there were chains on the building doors and nails in every single window. I had *a lot* of time to prep, as the junkies I lived with spent most days on street corners and dirty carpeted floors. I worked my way down the stairs in a slight haste, as to not miss my opportunity. That's where I ran into Lisa. *Fault number two.* She didn't notice me in her rush. Had she of taken two seconds to look at me, she might have noticed the two 5.5L kerosene tanks I was carrying with me. 

Once I reached the outside, I made sure to secure the chains and the perimeter - couldn't have any witnesses. Luckily for me, junkies and whores don't operate in the daylight. I poured the kerosene tanks into the vents, drenching the kinder I had already placed in them. A decent amount, approximately four or five fluid ounces spilled on me because of my nervous shaking. I was concerned that I lost too much to finish my plans, but it was too late to turn back.

With the flick of a lighter, the heat was fixed. 

It took four minutes and eighteen seconds before the flame reached a point where Lisa noticed. 

Five minutes and four seconds until I heard her pounding on the main doors, crying for help.

Eight minutes exactly until I saw her in the fourth floor hallway window.

Eight minutes and twenty-four seconds until she dove through the window, landing on her legs and snapping them into pieces. 

After my hands were sufficiently warmed from the flames, I walked over to Lisa to check on her. Apparently bones that tear through skin smell like almonds - who knew? As she laid there, it was clear that she wanted to cry but couldn't, presumably due to the shock and a drug cocktail she no doubt had at some point that day. I'll admit this, although I hate to, but my curiosity *did* get the best of me. I wanted to know if they were real or not. I took my keys and rammed the longest one into her left breast, breaking directly into the skin. I pulled my key down to her nipple and, well, they were real. 

Renters Insurance paid for $3,029.00 of my property lost during the fire. I used most of that for reallocation purposes - I'm sure you can understand. My apartment now is significantly nicer, and I haven't had any issues with heating. My thermostat stays at a constant 85 degrees. The only issue I'm begging to have is in terms of space. Almost every month, I lose a little more room to another body that follows me home. 

It might be time for another insurance claim.

Yours Truly,

<TEXT> Our Fizzy Mouth-Tinglers are a wondrous contraption    
that will release your soul with it's skin-melting action. 

Just pop one right in and wait for a sound    
as I tell you the tale of Mary McCloud.

Mary, oh Mary, was a sweet simple girl    
who fancied herself a man with a pearl.

She lied and she cheated and spent all his money,    
so he found a cure for that detestable honey.

"Fizzy Mouth-Tinglers!" The man said with a wink.     
"She'll only need one - no need for a drink." 

As he sat in his car waiting for his love to come home,    
his thoughts were ceased by a ping from his phone.

"Negative Balance," he read monotone    
as he realized his life would be better alone.

She got off the train and into the car    
and he offered her a mint before they got too far.

She accepted the gift, as she often did    
and before long the tires started to skid.

The woman clawed and she gasped as she melted away.    
The man kept on to the ravine, where her skeleton would stay.

In a matter of moments the deed was done with a *splash*    
and the man drove away, barely making a flash.

So that is the tale of old Mary McCloud    
and how those with vengeance will walk away proud. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Laura:** No one believes me.

**Dr. Sterling:** Just tell me one more time, Laura.

**Laura:** Fine.

**Dr. Sterling:** Is it okay if we record this session?

**Laura:** No, fuck you.

**Dr. Sterling:** Laura...

**Laura:** Last time. Then I'm leaving.

**Dr. Sterling:** Thank you.

**Dr. Sterling:** Patient Name - Laura Michaels. Occupation - unemployed. Session Number - twelve of fifteen as mandated by the State Rehabilitation Program.

Go ahead, Laura. Tell me about what happened the day at the park.

**Laura:** We were sitting on the park bench - the same one we've spent so much time on over the past couple years. The bigger one with no armbars and room for three people. It was 12:30 in the afternoon. I think. 

**Dr. Sterling:** Are you sure that was the exact time?

**Laura:** I don't fucking know! Jesus Christ, you people. Everything's a blur. I'm doing the best that I can.

It was lunch time, okay? I know because Mr. Greg Hamilton was out in the park getting his daily hotdog and barbeque chips. Will you let me talk? Damn.

Bobby and I were meeting at the bench to talk about what to do next. We were enjoying some ice cream cones that he got us because of how stressful everything had been. I was especially out of it that day and he was trying to cheer me up. For as horrible of a life he's put me through that man has a damn good heart. 

We had to make a decision that day. 

**Dr. Sterling:** About-

**Laura:** Yeah. 

**Dr. Sterling:** We're talking about-

Yes, that decision. I remember telling Bobby that I couldn't stay long...but he showed up with those cones and I couldn't resist his charm. Superman - my favorite. 

It was hot. I was eating the ice cream pretty fast. It was melting down my hands. It couldn't have been more than five minutes when Bobby broke the silence with his words:

'You know we have to do it.'

Time stopped. My hands squeezed the cone so hard it cracked and fractured. All I could do was sit there licking time by. Everything was so...off, but so right. For a moment, I didn't hate myself anymore. I was okay. 

Then I started seeing the green dots and everything got so bright that I couldn't see. That's the last thing I remember from the park.

**Dr. Sterling:** That's the last memory you can recall?

**Laura:** Yes.

**Dr. Sterling:** Are you sure?

**Laura:** Well, no. It...there wasn't anything else that happened at the park.

**Dr. Sterling:** Would you like some tea?

**Laura:** Yeah, I'd love some. Thank you.

Thanks.

---

That wasn't all I remembered - it was simply all I was willing to say to Dr. Sterling again. The recording I just transcribed for you was probably the fifth or sixth time I was forced to recount my story. Don't get me wrong, she was an excellent, compassionate woman but even she was skeptical of what happened to me. To the State, I was another junkie who was forced to get clean or go to jail. I believe that impacted her ability to fully trust me. Especially with some of the other heroin addicts I would see in the waiting room. I don't hold any ill will towards her.

What happened was so traumatic that I was able to kick heroin with minimal effort - aside from the mandated state program I was forced to go through after my hospital stay. I don't wish it on anyone, but I hope that by sharing my experiences it can create awareness about what the drug can bring you down to.

---

When I was able to see again, I was laying on a cold table staring back at my reflection on a metallic ceiling. I couldn't move at first but I wasn't tied down or anything. It felt like sleep paralysis, if you've ever been through that. No matter how much I struggled to move my body - even wiggle a toe - nothing would happen.

I don't remember being scared at all, but when I try hard to remember waking up on that table I run into a mental block. I clearly remember what I saw, and how my body felt. But my emotions and thoughts...I feel like they are being held back. Even to this day. The memory is *right* there but I can't reach it. Almost as if parts of my experience have been censored. Maybe because there were so many bright, blurry lights I wasn't able to focus on my feelings and I just don't have a memory of them. All I can say for certain is that I was on a table because I remember my reflection.

I don't have any clue how much time passed. It could have been hours or days. Possibly longer. Possibly shorter. At some point a tall, lanky figure came and injected me in the arm with some sort of serum that burned as it coursed through my veins. I wanted to scream and cry and thrash until I could get off of the table, but my body was motionless. 

More time passed.

My next clear memory is of my legs in stirrups, and the worst pain I've ever felt destroying my abdomen, sucking out my insides. I couldn't see anything except for the lights, but I could feel dozens of thin, warm fingers poking and prodding at every inch of my body.

"Donor. Donor. Donor. Donor." Resonated throughout the area around me. A chant from a murderous cult? Questions from a group of scientists? I don't know. The word haunts my dreams every night. If I even hear the word I break down. The medication can't even protect me from it. 

"Stop! Stop! Now!" I suddenly gained my ability to move as I felt the remaining pieces of my insides being torn away from me. The tall, lanky man stood over me and injected more serum into my neck, causing my world to spin until it went silent and black.

I awoke in a hospital bed. So, so many doctors were around me, joined by men and women in suits and two police officers. They had hours of questions for me. 

The official documentation by the police says that I overdosed on heroin in the park, and Bobby took me to one of those "back-alley" doctors to have our baby removed. I don't know if I believe that. They took my baby to the sky for their experiments. I know it. They know it. 

It doesn't matter now. The law is the law. Bobby has been in prison for years. They still haven't found my baby or the alleged doctor. I don't think they ever will. 

I don't know exactly what happened to me. What I do know is that heroin brought me to that point. It cost me my child. I never got the chance to see his face because a drug was controlling my life and my actions. Stay away from it. Help others get away from it. Don't be me.

I would give anything to see my baby.

Years might have passed, but I won't forget his name. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I tried so hard to be everything that she wanted. 

Hours a day at the gym perfecting my body so she could brag to her girlfriends about how sexy I was. 

Countless hours of overtime at the office so I could buy her the most expensive gifts, and support a lavish lifestyle in our Manhattan apartment. 

I enrolled our kids in sports, arts, and other classes so she could watch them develop and succeed in life.

And she still left.

She said I wasn't there for her enough, that I was too focused on myself. 

"It's too late to apologize." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've always experienced sleep paralysis *after* lucid dreaming. I don't know if that's typical or not. I never wanted this. Not any of it.

Once Dr. Malic got arrested for malpractice and we found out about the experiments he was doing to young boys like myself well...we knew it was only a matter of time before the "symptoms" started. 

I was 20 when I first saw the Dark Man. That's when the sleep paralysis began. He would straddle himself over me and stare into the windows to my soul, mere inches between our faces. 

The dreams started not long after. I've been battling him for five years now. I don't know how much longer I can go on like this, with no sleep. </TEXT>

I'm a well-known connoisseur of the yeast-brewed drinks. In my life I've probably had tens of thousands, if not more.

Today is my last one until the day I die, when I can share one with my old man again. 

I wish my little girl was around to hear this - she would be so proud of me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know what it is about sex that disgusts me. 

Maybe it's the exchange of bodily fluids, or the squishing and other filthy noises.

Perhaps the thought that ten minutes of intensity followed by years of guilt is too much to bear.

It could also be that I haven't dated anyone in years and have grown to resent the act itself due to lack of intimacy.

No one wants me for more than a night. I don't think I'll ever understand why.

All of these girls just see me as a paycheck.

And I see them as an expense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jobs come and go. That's part of the beauty of living in America - you can change jobs freely if you aren't happy. It's a luxury not everyone in the world has.

For years and years, my life was consumed by business - retail, specifically. It wasn't my plan...I sort of fell into it. My part-time cashier job turned into a full-time management job and, as anyone who's worked in retail knows, once you get to that point it's hard to get out. I wasted about five years at Target until my career path unexpected changed for the better.

It was a chance encounter - fateful, even. She came into the store to return a set of lingerie but our guest services team member wasn't letting it happen. It was a no-receipt return, and she didn't have the method of payment *or* her I.D. with her. Typical scam set-up. As those usually go, she asked to speak with a manager. I have no doubts she caught me mouthing "damn" as I walked up to the front end to speak with her. She was a tan goddess, about 5'3" with a perfect, Playboy-esque body, brunette hair, and a lip ring. She looked like the type of girl who could post a single cleavage shot on Instagram and become an overnight internet celebrity. 

On the surface, she looked like the type that might use her looks to be able to swoon guys into mindlessly doing what she wanted. A little flirting, a slight lean over the counter, and anything she needed was done - regardless of policy. 

Well, maybe not just on the surface. I did exactly that.

I couldn't resist her allure. 

I thought about her non-stop for a few days after that. She was visually perfect in every sense of the word. Her body inspired me. I wanted to capture elegance like hers to look at anytime I desired. 

Transitioning into a photographer seemed natural after meeting her. It was as if she rewired my brain, causing me to notice the beauty in everything I saw. Every second I wasn't at work, I was adventuring and capturing the sights of the world surrounding me. Some days I even had to call off because I had let my passions take me too far away to be able to drive back for my shift. 

It was...freeing. 

Only a couple of months had passed until I ran into my muse at the local Starbucks. She was in front of me, ordering a grande white chocolate mocha - no whipped cream. A delicious drink for a delicious woman, of course. After I ordered the same drink as a venti, I nervously walked down to the end of the counter to wait for my drink...and silently observe her magnificence.

"Hey! Aren't you the guy from Target that helped me return those undies?!" She spoke to me. I almost died.

"Oh, ha. Yeah, I believe that was me." I always hated my ugly, nervous laugh.

"You were so awesome!" She said as she gave me a tight hug. "I was able to get a new set because of you, see?" 

She pulled down her deep-cut v-neck, revealing to me a lacy, purple bra that hardly covered her voluptuous, tan breasts. 

"I'm Jess, by the way. I've gotta run but I'm sure I'll see ya around!"

She wasn't wrong. We seemed to bump into each other almost daily after that moment at the coffee shop. If it wasn't a face-to-face encounter, when I would go home and upload my photos she would be in them to some degree. Every. Day. I didn't mind - she made my photos come to life, enhancing the already spectacular scenes with her own stunning looks.

I'm not sure if she knew I was taking her picture or not. Some days she would appear oblivious, and the photos would come across voyeuristic. Maybe she would be turned away, eating an ice cream cone. Tying her Vans. Fixing up her hair. Just casual things. Other times, she seemed to be staring right at me as I clicked the button. A few times she was putting on a blouse. Another was she putting gas in her white Beetle. Once, she was nude in the forest. Always facing directly towards me. Always staring into my soul. 

As guilty as it made me feel, she never took legal action, nor made it seem like she wanted me to stop. To be honest, *she* was the one showing up in all of *my* pictures. She wouldn't really have had the basis to take up recourse. The longer it went on without any signs of discontent, the less guilty I began to feel. In my mind, it became a game. Two lovers, flirting without ever needing to meet. I was sure we were both in on it, but one of us had to win eventually.

It's her.

I was out late last night, trying to catch photos of the super moon over train tracks - a truly stunning scene. Pines lined both sides of the tracks, the rock hills were even and undisturbed, and the sky was clear aside from the massive, massive moon. I'll admit, I went a little crazy with the picture taking and filled up the remaining space on my SD card trying to capture the perfect scene.

She was in the photos. 

There was no way Jess was able to have been there. The area was completely void of life while I was capturing it!

She was in the middle of the tracks, entwined with a dark skinned man.

*click*

They began kissing.

*click*

He grabbed onto her ass, and she wrapped her hands around the back of his head.

*click*

He was looking directly at me. His body hadn't moved.

*click*

Jess held his head in her hands, his body was on the ground. 

*click*

She faced me directly, with that soul-stealing glare.

*click*

Dozens of small, white creatures piled over the man's body. Jess had disappeared.

*click*

The creatures and the body were gone. 

*click*

Jess was sitting indian-style mere feet away from the camera.

I screamed and ran into the bathroom, barely making it to the toilet. I couldn't believe it. There was **nobody** on the tracks. How could she be in every single picture?! In hopes that I was losing my mind, I drowned myself in cold water from the sink and went to try looking at my gallery again. 

The pictures were empty. 

My mind and body decided that I couldn't take this anymore and I had to sleep. I woke up in my chair about an hour ago. The pictures were still void of Jess, the man, and those weird fucking creatures...but she was outside of my window, sitting on my lawn staring directly into my eyes as I looked outside. 

I've never seen her outside of a photograph since the coffee shop.

She's gorgeous. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi there, /u/skittle021. Here's my statement for you. 

First of all, you are *more* than a little incorrect about speaking with me and receiving my blessing to narrate my works. Per the email **I sent to you after being informed that you narrated my story without permission**, I informed you of what my requirements are to be given permission to use my works. To quote myself:

"I'm always more than happy to let someone narrate a story of mine when **they discuss it with me first, and we agree on terms.** You, however, did not do this and my requirements for credit on a narration are a bit more than a small source link at the bottom of the video description."

[Email here.](http://i.imgur.com/p1AQRJP.jpg)

I did, however, ask you to meet the requirements outlined in the email - something which you were barely able to do. I tend to be very lenient with who I will let narrate my stories, and my requirements are minimal. Take, for example, [this](http://i.imgur.com/VBVyaf8.jpg) recent request I received. I don't ask for much. Also, did you notice how they asked me if he could narrate the story? Try to remember that. That's the proper way to go about doing this.

**Never did I state that you can use any of my future works.**

Let's address the issue of legalities. Now, I'm no lawyer, but I believe anyone who posts content on Reddit is covered by intellectual property laws. I think, I mean, I'm *really* not a lawyer and have minimal understanding of complex laws. You're sort of correct about YouTube terms of service. However, YouTube also protects content creators - which I am. Therefore, I have filed my DMCA requests through the appropriate channels to have your videos using my works removed. You can remove them voluntarily, but I will not retract my claims. That's all I'm willing to say on that manner. 

Also, had you talked to me about "Election Day: 2016" you would know that the candidate I wrote the story about isn't [Trump.](http://i.imgur.com/NkTP2i5.jpg).

P.S.

It's pronounced kuh-newt-son. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Robots Need Less Than Three [Noir Contest] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-12 16:31:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As soon as they stepped off of the ramp, the roar of currents transcending through inaudible moans deafened them.

"This is the UltraWhore," the navigator yelled "robo-prostitution is the entire purpose of this place." He walked towards the edge of the platform and down at the dozen or so cheap, 2040s style motels below. The kind that gangsters used to churn tricks out of. The navigator reached in his jacket and placed a brown envelope in his companion's hand.

"One of them have gone sentient." He paused with a concerned look. "It wants love, Micah."

"Aren't these things only programmed for sex?" Micah asked, although he was no stranger to the operation.

"That's why you're here." The navigator gave Micah a nod and returned to the vessel. The UltraWhore was one of those places that everyone was aware of but didn't acknowledge. Using Robots for sex became legalized by Consul Robertson about twenty years prior, under the condition that the line of software used was, under no circumstances, allowed to be programmed with A.I. capabilities. These were drones. Similar to the machines that used to manufacture automobile parts in the 2000s. Mindless husks who served one purpose: pleasure fulfillment. The fact that one of the bots became self-aware meant a developer broke the law.

Despite all of the controversy, the UltraWhore operated smoothly. Sure, there were protests. All of those "Robot Lives Matter" groups loved to spend their weekends in front of the landing platform telling all of the patrons how terrible they are. It had the stigma one would expect a place like this to have. Despite it's crisp, clean appearance, at the end of the day beings were coming to this place for sex - it never sat well with society. Micah wasn't one for politics. As a sanctioned vigilante, he took jobs for the paycheck - not morals.

Micah descended into the small city, reading over the contents of the envelope on the transit ride. 

---

`Building 84`

`Female: Model F81-FBF6D9-0`

`Manufacturer: Vital Wires Corp.`

`Robot has gained awareness. Subject allegedly asked multiple patrons if it "is pretty enough" and has told some male patrons it loved them.`

`Payment will be received upon deactivation of unit. Additional payment may be acquired if proof of fault is provided.`

---

Enclosed with the briefing was a PcC with the Robot's stock photo. Young, blonde, and caucasian with blue eyes, a large bust, and a slim waist - the generic model that most of the I.G. politicians preferred. It confused Micah. He couldn't fathom why such a popular model with the tenure it had would have been programmed to go live. 

*"Building 84 - your stop, sir or madame."*

Micah stepped out onto the stoop of a short, long building with the number '84' partially illuminated over the doorway. As he walked up to the archaic revolving doors the smell of sweat and sex permeated the air.

"Must be the spot." He chuckled to himself.

Micah placed his hand on the door scanner and a little floating orb appeared next to him. 

"Micah Gladstone. 36. Male. Unwed. What can we help you with?" The orb stated in a surprisingly pleasant tone.


Logging basic information wasn't a new process, but Micah still despised it - he needed no reminders that he was divorced. She left him in a fit of rage over a job Micah worked during the drug wars. It wasn't entirely his fault. If Micah didn't have sex with that woman, his cover would have been blown and he wouldn't be alive today. The situation made no difference to his wife, who left the night she found out and never came back. He still feels the pain each time he was scanned.

"Er. Hello. I'm here to spend some time with F81-FBF6D9-0. I just nee-"

"Requesting Manager. Please wait." The orb interrupted. Not even a minute later, the doors lifted and an older, portly gentleman briskly walked out, grabbing Micah's hand without hesitation. 

"Hey there, son. I hear you're lookin' to see my Felicia. This way." The Manager walked inside the building and Micah followed, slightly taken back.

"Micah, is it? My niece dated a Micah once. Pleasant boy. Son, I know you were sent to come deactivate my sweet, inn'cent Felicia but first I need you to un'erstand somethin'."

"Sir, I'm just here to do a job and collect my payment." Micah stopped walking. "I understand you have a job to do, but I also have tasks I need to complete." The Manager turned to face Micah with a homely smile and warm eyes.

"I know, son. Just listen. Then I'll take ya to see Felicia. Deal?" He stretched his hand out to Micah.

"Deal."

"Thank You. Pardon me if I bore ya. I don't often need ta come 'n talk with our patrons." The Manager began walking down a hall, signaling Micah to follow. "In these halls, Robots are sex toys - nothin' more, nothin' less. The 'lectrical currents runnin' through them pleases our patrons by the thousan's. Here, our currency is pills - ya know - the meal pills. Mostly roun' and small ones but pills nevertheless. We donate our earnings to the kids, Micah. I pride myself on keepin' money outta this. This is purely to help people feel better, be it those hungry kids or business fellas. Now, a few days -"

"Sir," Micah interrupted. 

"Now, now. We had a deal." The Manager smiled at Micah and kept talking. "A few days ago, on'a my most popular girls comes up to me 'n says she wants to feel love. Love, son. They aren't supposed to want that...and yet here we are." 

The Manager stopped in front of a dark purple door and pulled Micah under his arm.

"Like I said, I run this comp'ny to please. Felicia wants to feel love - can you at least listen to what she has to say?" The Manager pulled away and walked up to the door. "I know you have a job. I know she can be replaced...give her a shot." The Manager opened the door, upturning his palm, telling Micah to enter.

Given the passion of the Manager, Micah was expecting this Robot to be different than the usuals. Gorgeous - stunning even. Something special that would set it apart from the other, similar models.

Nothing. 

The stock photo was dead-on. A slim, blonde bombshell was sitting on a white, silk covered bed rubbing the spot next to it with it's hand.

"Come sit, Micah."

He obliged.

"I know why you're here. I get it - I'm not supposed to feel this way," it leaned over and whispered in Micah's ear, "*but Robots need love too*."

Micah sat back, stunned at what he had just heard come from the lips of this Robot. It didn't mutter the generic, lust-filled phrases he was used to. No, this Robot just spoke intelligently - fully aware of the situation. Before he could formulate a response, a sharp pain radiated throughout his body and his world went black. 


When he awoke, Micah was sitting upright in a chair surrounded by walls full of computers and wires.

"Oh, about time ya woke up!" The Manager said as he floated his chair over to Micah. "Do ya see what I meant, son? She un'erstan's things that no Robots do. It's progress."

"Wh...what?" Micah stammered as he stood up to walk around the room and examine the area."What the hell is going on here?!"

"Highly magnetized motherboards. I wouldn't touch 'em if I were you. They don't store any mem'ry for longer than a day - so ya can't damage 'em - but hot dang will they shock the shit outta ya." The Manager chuckled. "I'll just be up front. I put ya in here. I called in the work order. I'm payin' for this...job."

Never one to lose his cool, Micah sat back down in the chair he woke up in. Not speaking nor taking his eyes off of the Manager. In his gut, he knew something was off about this old man, but he also knew that even without weapons he could end the Manager's life with ease.

"I'm glad you're an easy-going fella. Don' worry - we're safe in this room."

"Safe?"

"Welp, years an' years ago, I pioneered a new tech and installed x-ray scanners into my girls' eyes. Material on this Region is ev'rythin'. Anythin' can be sold. So, I designed 'em to be able ta find stuff."

One of the walls began to whir, drawing Micah's attention. 

"Just that orb, son. Nothin' worth gettin' worked up over." The Manager stood up to stretch. "All of my girls cum. Every time. It's a fluorescent splatter that jolts inside of the patron 'n it sends a little 'lectric charge into their body. It delays the end of the transaction by somethin' I call 'Euphoric Paralysis' which gives the girls long 'nough to take what they can. No one has ever caught on."

"You're a crook, old man." Micah stood up. "I'm not taking your dirty money." He began to walk towards the only thing that resembled a door in the entire room. He placed his hand on the scanner and the wall disappeared, revealing a Robot riding on top of a slightly overweight man who was clearly out of breath. The Manager stood beside Micah and crossed his arms. "Watch."

Micah was barely able to keep his eyes open.


It took him months to finally track down his ex-wife. She planet-hopped, something Micah considered a bit extreme given the situation. She was living in a cozy, suburban town on Earth in a small, green house. Lots of yard space - something they always talked about having. He walked up the stone pathway to the front door with hopes of making amends.


Oh God! A female voice shrieked, causing Micah to panic. He ran around the house, searching the windows to get a visual of his ex-wife and any potential danger she was in. As Micah rounded the back of the house, he heard more noises - clearer than before. Moans. Grunts. *Pleasure.* He stopped, and looked into the window in front of him. On top of the table was an overweight man, panting for breath as his ex-wife was straddled on top of him, writhing in ecstasy.


This Robot in the room in front of him was a thick, voluptuous brunette that might as well have been a carbon copy of his ex-wife. 


Within a moment, the moans intensified and a bright pink liquid secreted from the Robot's vagina. The man, looking so pleased with himself, laid there looking to the ceiling as the Robot raided his pockets on the other side of the room. Micah slammed his open palms into the wall at full-force.

"It was an infection," the Manager said softly, "she went ta get energy packs when a Grud stuck 'er with it's tendrils. No normal doc could help 'er, and we had to rely on experimental treatments." He wiped a tear from his eye. "They were...expensive. That's how all this started, and now I'm in too deep ta just stop."

"Who?" Micah asked, beginning to feel something resembling sympathy. 

"My wife." The Manager walked away from the window. "I couldn't save 'er. I became attached to Felicia because she looked jus' like my wife did in her youth. I think that's how she became sentient."

"I'm sorry. I don't quite follow. What does this have to do with me?" Micah returned to his chair.

"Exactly what I'm payin' ya for. Felicia needs to be shut down."

The "Golden Rule" of investigating - one Micah always followed - was not to dig deeper into a case than is needed to complete the job. That's when personal influence comes into play, and morals don't pay bills. 

This job...this job was one of a kind. 

Micah, as much as he knew he shouldn't, needed to know more. Something about the Manager, his story, this...situation didn't add up.

"What happened to 'progress' with your girls?" Micah asked sternly. "If you've put in the effort to create a crime syndicate, why are you concerned with shutting down one that went rogue?" 

The Manager snapped, "She's not rogue!" he slammed his fist against a metal hard drive casing, causing some sparks to fly. Micah hit a sensitive spot, and he knew it.

"Easy, old timer. I get what you're doing - this isn't my first job. You're about to be caught and you want me to save you ass."

"You're not entirely wrong," the Manager replied calmly, "'cept I'm not 'bout to be caught." He pulled a PcC from his pocket and tossed it to Micah, who missed as a flash of light overtook the room for a second.

"On that device, you'll see transcripts of conversations she's been having with our patrons. This whole 'love' thing is just a front. She's been trying to drop hints about the corruption. No one has caught on, but that's not to say it won't happen if she isn't shut down." The Manager walked away. "The money will be in your account once she's deactivated. Best of luck, son."

More confused than anything, Micah decided not to open the files on the PcC and left through the entryway the Manager opened up. Felicia was waiting at the end of the hallway. Without any exchange of words, the Robot led him to a different room than the one they first met in. 

"He wants you to kill me, you know." Felicia spoke softly. 

"You can't die. You're a Robot." Micah was annoyed.

"You don't understand!" It began to sob. "All I want is love. That's all. Just love."

The Robot began secreting tears from its eyes and breathing rapidly. While highly unusual for a Bot, Micah knew the Manager wasn't dealing with the typical models from Vital Wires. These had been augmented. Micah started examining her body for a control panel. 

"I'll pay you, I have so much money stored away!" Felicia pleaded, as Micah searched her body. She was warm to the touch and her soft skin felt pleasurable to Micahs rough, lonely hands.

"Micah!" A grainy voice boomed from the ceiling. "Son, add two-thousand if you end it now so I don't have to watch this drag on."

"Where's her box?!" Micah shouted to the tiny camera he noticed in the corner.

"No box, son. These girls aren't different. There's a gun under the bed, loaded with electric rounds. They'll fry her systems and you can head out. I'm sure you want to be done with this job already." 

The Manager was absolutely right. Micah was tired of whatever game was going on in this robotic cesspool. Without any further hesitation, Micah reached under the Robot's legs and grabbed the gun. After checking the chamber, he stood up and pointed it at Felicia's chest. She sat there, sobbing and staring at Micah. 

"Bye, Felicia." Micah said as he pulled the trigger.

Everything went white, and a loud, continuous beep resonated through Micah's head.

"*Simulation Terminated*"

A burning sensation in the back of Micah's head caused him to scream out in pain.

"Easy there, Cadet." A stern, male voice spoke from beyond the white light.

"What...wha..?" Micah was unable to find words.

"You killed a human - too focused on the incentive. Test failed. Lay here until your sight comes back, then meet me in my office." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Elections? Pffffft. What a load of runny dog shit. **I** didn't vote for him and, in fact, no one I know or have talked to in the past year voted for him either. 

What happened to our "voices matter?"

I can't even begin to wrap my head around this situation. We just elected someone who has *zero* experience in our political system. This guy - this fucking guy - has only been involved in our world for the past two years. **Two years!** That's it! Yet we're all expected to follow suit and just cozy up next to him and give him undying support.

Fuck that.

This election was rigged. I can't prove it, but dammit...I know it was. Like I said, no one I know of voted him in - and I know basically everyone, aside from a few of the people in our foreign territories. Well, I don't know them personally. I watch them. We watch everyone. Just like us in the Headquarters, exactly zero percent of the population was stupid enough to vote for someone who doesn't understand our system.

It doesn't matter, though. Yesterday, I decided to take a stand against this. 

We have rules. Not guidelines. Not suggestions. Rules. Rules detailing how we are allowed to conduct ourselves, how we can dress, public acts - damn near everything we do is governed by one of the rules. One rule in particular clearly states that we are not allowed to protest in city streets due to the fact that it can disrupt the general population and give us a bad image. We never really break the rules, but I felt like this was the time to make my opinion heard.

I organized a protest through social media under the guise of a fake name. I wanted to get a group to run right through the streets - signs and all - not stopping until the police physically ended it. To my surprise, a couple hundred people clicked "attending" within the first hour. It was perfect. I sent out messages to every person and confirmed attendance. Then, I sent out of few telegrams to some people close to me to see if they wanted in on the fun - they did. 

We all met in the park around 7pm to spread out signs, designate paths and escape plans, and determine our rally chants. By 9pm we were ready to mobilize. To my dismay, the group decided that we should all march as one massive unit as opposed to splitting up into smaller groups that could cover more area. That decision was going to make my personal plans a bit more difficult, but not impossible.

We began marching to the heart of city. I led the pack with two of my closer friends, chanting "Revoke the Vote" and keeping our group as loosely organized as possible. We barely made it a block before garnering lots of attention from the general public. Some were yelling obscenities at us. Others began to march with us. 

After another few blocks, once the group was good and worked up, I handed the syringes to my friends and we fell back to different parts of the crowd. It was hardly a chore to rally my first victim away with the pretense that I knew a way to "*really* get our message across." I took him behind a small little Chinese restaurant on 42nd, and showed him the small handgun I had with me. 

"A few shots in the air, and the media will swarm us, man." I said as I handed the gun to him. As he admired it's shoddy craftsmanship I stabbed his neck with the syringe. His crying couldn't be heard over the deafening drone of the "Revoke the Vote" chants. 

The process for transformation takes anywhere between thirty seconds and four minutes to start, depending on the person and amount of toxin injected. This guy was a bit on the scrawny side, and before a full minute has elapsed his pores were tearing open and the sludge was forcing its way out. Brown, black, and thick - it had him entirely covered and stuck to the ground before two minutes had passed. Cocoon established. By the fourth minute, the cocoon had hardened and was beginning to crackle as the new creature was preparing to emerge. 

It ripped itself from it's shell to the chorus of it's skin tearing away from the insides like Velcro peeling apart. That's always been my least favorite part, honestly. But there it was - a magnificent specimen. Oily bronzed skin, hairless body, and merged digits - it was divine. Although the creatures always have skin covering their eyes and mouths, I could have sworn this one was smiling at me as if to say "thank you."

It tilted its featureless head to the sky and began twitching in small, rapid movements...a sign that my friends were also able to subdue their victims.

"Infect!" I commanded. Without hesitation, it sprinted out into the streets, catching up to the crowd in mere seconds. I kept to the shadows while I observed the demonstration. 

As it reached the back of the group, it explosively expanded its body into thousands of fibrous tendrils that covered ten or so people in the back of the crowd. The rest of the people began to turn around at the cries for help, but before they could react the other creatures overtook them as well. The lucky few that weren't instantly consumed made an honorable attempt at running away until one-by-one they were disabled by the coughing and subsequent vomiting of the sludge. Within five minutes we now had hundreds of cocoons littering the city streets. Complete infection was imminent...until our "elected" official decided to show his face. 

He stood there, taking it all in, and in his eyes I could see the fear settling in. The underestimation of what our organization is capable of. But in a flash of intense red light, it was all gone. The creatures, the cocoons - gone. It was daylight again, and life was moving around me as if nothing had ever happened. Nothing had changed, except the two black marks I gained on each of my palms. I was done. 

I have to move to Canada, now. International rules will keep me away from the organization and our new leader's reach. In my ignorance I made assumptions about him based on nothing more than hearsay and frustration. 

Now I'm a target.

The others will surely terminate me if they see me again after my stunt. It's safe there...I hope. </TEXT>

A series implies that each part is going to be a piece of the overall story, just broken up due to character length or what have you. So if it's an entirely separate story than I can't see it being considered a series even with the same characters. 

But I'm like, not a mod or anything. So take this for what you will. They'll be here, though. The mods watch us.

<TITLE> STEAL THIS STORY </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-10 15:51:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It all started with an email:

**Steve, you might want to see this**

*Hey man, about that story you wrote last week. This dude is claiming it on his channel. Zero credit. Zero source links. Might wanna send a claim before it gets too big.*

---

Even as a writer, I can't begin to appropriately describe the rage I felt as I clicked on that YouTube link. 

There it was, right in front of my eyes. *My* story. My breakthrough story, at that. 9:38 of his voice pretending that he was the mastermind behind the story that took the internet by storm for weeks. News channels talked about it. Snopes debunked it. Cities released statements trying to kill the small bits of hysteria it created. This was *huge* - maybe even bigger than Slenderman - and then there was this asshole acting like it was his idea. His creation. His baby. 

YouTube is interesting in its copyright process. If you feel that your intellectual property has been stolen, you can file a DMCA claim against the owner of the channel the video was uploaded to. After a small appeals process, YouTube will decide either in favor of the channel owner or the creator of the original content. It doesn't always go the way it should, and lots of content creators get fucked by ruthless YouTube personalities looking for quick ways to gain a lot of views.

I was one of the unlucky ones. 

"Insufficient Proof" was the reason cited for the denial of my claim. To be honest, I couldn't be mad about that. I spent weeks leading up to the release of my story figuring out how to remain anonymous for immersion purposes. I wanted the reaction that the story garnered and, unfortunately, this was the consequence of that. I never wanted the fame or attention - but after that denial, I decided to go ahead and sacrifice my anonymity for the sake of shutting this guy down.

In the email, I made a point of letting him know that if he were to relinquish that he didn't create the story, he would be the first and only person to know where the story originated. With that information, he would probably get tons of attention for being the only person to know the origin and I made it clear that I wouldn't argue anything he wanted to tell the media about how he found me. It seemed like a good trade-off. I'd get him to confess, he would get his attention. Win-win.

No response.

Two days later, I sent the same email again.

Nothing.

The following week or so became an obsession with contacting him. I sent numerous emails per day. I created fake names and emails to inquire about the story. I started sending him handwritten fan mail to the P.O. Box address he had listed on his website. Still, all I received was silence. He was very much active online. I was being blatantly ignored.

Funny thing about being ignored - it fosters anger. Anger births resentment. Resentment develops hatred. Hatred creates ideas.

P.O. Boxes have to be tied to a legal name. As luck would have it this fine, young fellow was using his real name as his YouTube personality name. It wasn't hard at all to trace him down to an exact region in Arkansas.

Luck was on my side again, as I had plenty of vacation time saved up. 

After arriving in his city, I spent a few days doing some reconnaissance to find him and learn his routines - which was *way* easier than I had initially thought. He was your typical "struggling artist" type who would spend his days sitting in a hipster coffee shop on his netbook instead of looking for a job. No exaggeration here. I followed him for four days - that's what he did every single day. Around dinner time he would retreat home to his parent's house and spend the rest of the night in his room working on "his" videos. 

Snatching him up was a cakewalk. He took a long, isolated road to the lovely indie coffee shop by means of bicycle. I simply ran him off the road and tossed him in the covered bed of my rental truck. At some point I recall feeling bad for doing this to someone who clearly had the mental capacity of a dried clam.

In my rage and meticulous preparations, I had found a wonderfully lonesom spot in the middle of the woods that was at least a mile away from civilisation in every direction. In that place, I dug a deep, narrow hole and placed some basic supplies inside of a tree. That's the situation the YouTube sensation woke up in - buried up to the neck with a plethora of tools in his sight.


The rush of emotions trying to properly express themselves on his face was borderline orgasmic to watch. He screamed. He cried. He begged. All while I sat there in silence and observed with a smug smile. In my mind I was kicking myself for not wearing a clown mask for shits-and-giggles.

Maybe twenty or thirty minutes had passed before I decided to say something to the thief. I hadn't prepared a grand speech, nor a vengeful verbal assault. My plan was more in the actions than in the enlightenments.

"You stole my story, among others. You fucked up. Fortunately for you, I'm the only one willing to act on it."

He started crying and squirming harder than before, probably with the realisation of what he'd done finally setting it. 

I grabbed the pair of scissors I brought with me, and held them up to his face. Then, I stood up, grabbed his stupid, curly ponytail mane, and cut it down to size. Honestly, that was more of a petty thing...but I have no regrets. 

After he had a brief moment of relief, I returned to his front and held the scissors to his face again. Once he resumed crying, I began laughing. 

"It's just a prank, bro! Mikey put me up to this!" I said as I gave him a rub on the head. He seemed relieved, and chuckled a bit between sobs.

"Just kidding, I don't know a Mikey."

With those words, I cut each side of his nostrils about halfway up with the scissors.

"There's a list of credentials you're going to add to the clown video in your pocket. You have a day. If you go to the police I'll come back." I said, as I slathered hand sanitizer on my hands in a poor effort to clean up. It wasn't working as well as I had hoped, so I squeezed out the rest of the bottle onto the bridge of his nose. I left before it ran down to his nostrils, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't pause when the shrieking started. 

He altered the video a bit later than I had given him, but I decided to chalk it up to the difficulty of getting out of the hole. I will admit, I have grave concerns about the police coming to arrest me. I fully intend on going back if I get the slightest inclination that he talked, but I'm still concerned nonetheless. I guess only time will tell. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys, Mikey here.

You might know me from such stories as ["Let's Not Make Political Comments Today"](https://youtu.be/-qv7k2_lc0M) and ["Borrasca. Always Borrasca."](https://youtu.be/5LGEiIL1__s)

How do you guys, gals, and /u/EtTuTortilla feel about comedy inside of horror? 

Let's not limit the media form, either. Should stories, movies, etc. maintain an entirely serious and scary feel or is it nice to get some good laughs and then scared to death? 

Any good examples of horror that blends in comedy without being satirical? Let's exclude Troma movies, which are obviously the gold standard.

Ps.

Shoutout to /u/vainercupidOOC who wrote my most recent story with me. It wouldn't have done nearly as well without her help and fantastic writing capabilities. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Election Day: 2016 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-08 14:38:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I work for a high-profile, unfavored candidate who has a chance of receiving your vote today. Due to what I'm about to tell you, I can't reveal who it is. Non-disclosures and such - I'm sure you can understand. What I can tell you is that there's more to this election than what some doctored tax records and planted emails can tell you. 


Wait. You don't actually *believe* any of those documents are legitimate, do you? 


Our campaign staff had those made and spread.


We **own** /r/politics.


We **own** /r/The_Donald. 


We **own** the mainstream media.


Every. Single. Fact you think you know - that you think you can believe - has been manufactured by our staff. Wikileaks is a farce. Sanders was a lie. Johnson was...well, Gary Johnson was a plan that went sour. We fixed that, though.


Now that we've gotten that out of the way, I would like to move onto the more pertinent information that may alter the election depending on who sees this. 


Our candidate is dangerous. Not in your "nuclear codes pressing - causing a war with Russia" kind of way. This candidate has killed people...many people, to get to the position they're in. Countries full of people have died for no reason other than their cravings for ultimate power and control. It's been covered up well and, for the most part, supported by the powers that run this country. Lately, though, we can't control it. Since the primaries began, our candidate has been getting increasingly more violent and unstable. 


It began in 1945. 


The idea came up that instead of leaving the election and fate of the country in the hands of the public and a few "wisely chosen" politicians, we could create the perfect presidents. Test tube babies, if you will. They could be raised and groomed in secret at Camp David in the presence of all of the greatest powers this country had ever seen. They would learn all of the secrets and ideologies...and then be put to sleep. Rather, a hypnotic sleep that would keep them from being able to access their memories and training until given seats of power. 


The issue was with the available technology at the time. While most conspiracy theorists were correct in believing we had technology available that the public wasn't aware of, it wasn't near what there is today in 2016. 


The manufactured young were a success. They were born healthy - free from defects and racial abnormalities. As they grew, they learned at an amazingly accelerated rate. The professors kept at the camp were some of the best in their fields and yet by the teen years, our premade candidates were stumping them at every logical fallacy. The problems were in the containment facilities. We...couldn't keep them locked in.


They began fleeing one by one, immersing themselves into the public and out of our reach. Some even began dabbling in politics, which made it incredibly hard to deal with them (See: JFK).


One stayed, however. Just one. Almost like it wanted to.


Needless to say, once the rest of them had escaped, most of our attention and funding was turned towards this one candidate. Our last hope, at least until the next batch were done incubating. We taught it everything it needed. We gave it the best upbringing Ive ever heard of. Hell, we spoiled the shit out of that thing. It got pretty much anything it wanted, whenever it wanted. It always got its way. We thought it was completely content being our little puppet, happy even. Until a few years ago, we really thought we had it completely under control. 


It did everything we told it to, played all its card right. Climbed the political ladder (with the help of its family members), made connections, made promiseseven instigated a few carefully chosen scandals, to appear more fallible. Not even the American public is stupid enough to trust a perfect candidate. You need your president to have *some* kind of personality. Even if that personality includes some less-than-savory aspects. 


In fact, you really like the scandals, dont you? That dirty underbelly keeps you watching, even while you scoff at the shitshow this election year has turned into. You keep crawling back for more, digging deeper, wanting to see what other skeletons your national leaders have in their closets. At your core, you want to be reassured that despite all their power, theyre humans. Just like you.


Thing is, with this candidate, the skeletons arent figurative. With this one, if you had the misfortune of seeing its true face, youd have nightmares for the rest of your life. I know from experience. It showed me what it really looked like, once. And let me assure you, despite all appearances, that thing is not human.


It manifests on the weaknesses of the human race. Sustains itself on the blood of the innocent victims of wars. The candidate had a hunger, and in our desperation, we gave in. Thousands of people killed just to be used as nourishment for this goddamn beast. You've heard of the bombings. All a cover-up for it. I know it's wrong. I get it. But I'm just a pawn in this operation - for now. I don't know how much longer I'll be involved after today.  


Honestly, we should have known, when the rest of them escaped, that they couldnt be controlled as easily as we thought they could. When this candidate stayed behind, passive and submissive, I guess we just kind of assumed the hypnosis took. All that MKUltra had to be good for something, right? We knew what we were doing - were part of the fucking US government, right? And now something seventy years in the making would finally come to fruition - wed be the ones holding the reigns when it finally rose to power. 


None of us knew that it wasnt sleeping. It had never been sleeping. None of us knew that it knew what it really was. For years, *years*, it sat under our noses, pretending to be the perfect obedient child, while really practicing its abilities, growing stronger by the day. 


But we know now, and it's too late. We made a single assassination attempt. The storm we dealt with after previous attempts was hard, and we still deal with it today, but we knew we needed to do something. 


One sniper. One bullet. 


The agent had a clear shot while the candidate was in the backyard of it's home. He took it - and it was a clear, definite hit in the chest. The candidate (according to the video transcript from the helmet cam) fell to the ground immediately and was visually confirmed by the agent to be killed. The conference room exploded in the most contained celebration you could ever imagine. 


The agent moved in to remove the body - per protocol - so it could be replaced with a body double. As he approched the body, and knelt next to it to feel for a pulse, the candidate said something to him. The audio isn't clear, but some analysts believe it may have been older Russian. The agent began to seize upon hearing the words. At that moment, the candidate sprung to life and grabbed the agent by the neck, squeezing harder and harder until there was a clear snapping of bones. Then it began to feast. 


The recovery team only found the camera, gun, some personal memorabilia, and the upper third of his body. 


If this thing gets elected - if it gets the chance to stand there and speak with the entire countrys eyes upon it - youll know, too.


Honestly, however it goes today - whoever you vote for - I have a feeling our baby will be the next president. Like I said, it always gets its way. And when it does, I suggest you play it safe. I suggest you avoid all television screens in general on January 20, 2017. But, even if you cant manage that, definitely do *not* to tune into its Inaugural Address.


Because I happen to know, that is when its going to shed its skin.

**Edit:**

Now we wait. </TEXT>

For example, the "I Dared My Best Friend" series  was written under a throwaway and was a **massive** hit. Those Search and Rescue stories - unknown user, biggest stories on the entire sub. 

It doesn't boil down to author's credibility. It's being good. The names you're seeing all the time are simply good writers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd imagine that they're quite common. Even boiling down to specific neighborhoods. 

There's always that weird neighbor, or that creepy house, or the historic building. Kids will always talk and make up stories about anything. I can think of like four or five about where I grew up off hand. If anything, I would imagine that more rural areas would have less stories because there isn't as much around. 

Um. Popcorn chicken is fucking tasty. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Podcast and desire to write aside, I don't believe there would be much of a difference between urban and rural "legend" stories, aside from the obvious (setting, character, etc.). Stories like those spread through word of mouth and - in these days - internet/social media. Regardless of where you live, the method of them becoming "urban legends" is going to be the same. 

Does that answer your question? I had a hard time extracting what you wanted to know. </TEXT>

With the same argumentation as the "clickbait titles are more believable" one might discuss the believability of the fact that who the hell would post to reddit while dangerous things are going on. That would remove 99 out of a 100 stories on here. 

Perfect point. I don't even have anything to add to this. I just wanted to agree with you in a more eloquent way instead of saying yes.

I am also very happy with the new rules. I can see the title rule resulting in a lot more exposure for stories that normally wouldn't be given a chance because of a "creative" title. Now people will actually have to read stories - damn!

<TEXT> Ma always told me that I had wanted to be an entertainer ever since I was old enough to stand up. She said I would walk into a group of people and start chatting away until they started laughing. Then, once I got them going, I would feed off of it - changing my routine to keep everyone laughing as long as possible. It was my talent. 

Ma knew I would be a comedian.

I didn't really see it, if I'm being honest with you all. When Ma passed in 2009 though, I felt like I needed to do something to pay my respects. 

There was a small club in my hometown just outside of Jersey called McKinnion's. Nothing spectacular there. When the washed up, D-List comedians would get booked they *might* draw in about fifty people to sit at their sticky tables. However, they booked anyone who could guarantee ten people. Desperate for business, much?

It took zero effort to get a gig there. Pauly Shore was coming through town on a Saturday and the guy at McKinnion's didn't even hesitate about giving me a twenty minute opening slot. 

Twenty minutes, though. How was I supposed to fill twenty minutes?! 

I spent the next week staying up late writing out my routine. It wasn't spectacular, but I managed to avoid cliche one-liners. Most of the routine consisted of jokes about having no clue how to perform stand-up comedy. I watched a few videos on YouTube and that seemed to be a solid starting point. 

Honestly, I was nervous to tell the guys at the job site. They were a bunch of macho construction workers and, while they always included me, I was the runt of the group. Much to my surprise the guys thought it was the greatest thing ever, and were pumped about coming to the show! It was bliss, if I've ever felt it. I was gonna tell my family, but I figured it could wait until I see if I was any good or not. My wife was a bitch - she'd never let me live it down if I ate dick.

The nerves didn't bother me the entire time leading up to the show...until about ten minutes before I was supposed to go on. The guys spared no expense to come show support. They brought their gals, buddies, and some family. Pauly said that in all of the times he played McKinnion's, that was the most packed he had ever seen it. 

The minutes turned to seconds in the blink of an eye. 

My breathing was heavy. My heart was pounding. Sweat was pooling in places I don't even wanna mention. Then the owner of the club came up to me. 

"Hey kid, I'm givin' ya an extra ten minutes. You earned it." He said to me with a grin and a pat on the back. 

Thirty minutes?! I barely had enough material to cover twenty! There wasn't any time to argue, though. It was already 9:01 and I had to get out there. Pauly rubbed my shoulders and wished me luck, and with that I walked out onto the stage to roars of clapping and cheers.

When I got up to the mic, I didn't hesitate at all to dive into my routine. It kind of came naturally to me...just like Ma always thought it would.

I started out strong, but toward the middle of my set things started to die out. I began losing confidence in my jokes. My voice started cracking every few words, and I started stuttering when it didn't even make sense. The club was getting quieter by the second.

"Listen, if you guys are gonna act like zombies and not laugh - I'm just gonna kill ya!"

I don't know where that line came from, and I don't particularly care because it slayed them. The entire joint *erupted* with laughter. I even saw Pauly cracking up on the side of the stage. Maybe it was the fact that I was a scrawny, light-skinned Italian guy threatening a gang of huge construction workers. Maybe it was them thinking my routine falling apart was hilarious. Either way, it doesn't matter. 

My routine was a hit.

McKinnion's kept inviting me back time after time after time. They started advertising me as "The Comedy Killer" and even gave me headlining spots from time to time! Each show brought in a slightly bigger crowd and my pay started getting a pretty hefty bump. At my peak there, I was bringing in about $800 a show. For perspective, Pauly only got $1,200 in cash on my first night.

After about a year and a half of performing exclusively at McKinnion's, a promoter for a comedy agency reached out to me. He was in charge of booking talent and had a 45 minute slot coming up at a gala event. If the show went well, I was promised a contract *that night.* I said yes, obviously.

I'll admit, before I went out on stage for that show my nerves were considerably more shot than my first night at the old club. I was standing behind a giant purple curtain on the stage in the basement of a mansion. The gala was a cancer benefit hosted by some internet millionaire, and to cut costs and maximize donations, he put on the entire thing at his house with his staff. I was used to the slum that graced the dirty walls and slippery floors of McKinnion's, not rich people eating fish eggs and sipping wine. 

My set started out alright - I got some good laughs and applause. It didn't turn south until I went to my trademark bit about killing everyone the audience. I won't list the nasty things that were yelled to me by hecklers, but I will say that it's apparently in poor taste to make jokes about death at a cancer benefit. I wasn't even allowed to finish my set or stay after I was taken off stage. 

I blew it. 

Getting escorted out by security did something to me. It evoked something I hadn't felt before. It was rage, but with a thirst. I felt like a man in a desert and my rage needed to be fulfilled. 

I called up Dougie, one of the guys from work. Dougie had been my closest friend for years. He was actually the one who landed me the job with the company. I needed someone to vent to - to get all of that anger off of my soul. I told him what happened, how my killing joke basically cost me a real career in comedy. I couldn't help but cry a bit. 

"Why don't you kill em then, bro?" He laughed. "Sorry man, I've gotta get Alaina to bed. Stop by tomorrow we'll grab some beers, yeah?"

"Kill em." It resonated with me. I mean, that was the entire part of my routine that got me to this gala in the first place. Maybe that's what I needed to pass my boundaries as a comedian. To get people to take me seriously.

I retreated to my car until the event had long since passed. I sat there for hours holding my glock, contemplating eternity. 

On one hand, if I killed someone, I'm a criminal. I get caught and I go to prison. 

On the other hand, this could cement myself as a legend: "The Comedy Killer."

Before I had enough time to come to a thought-out decision, the promoter walked out to his car. Before he got in, I got out and asked him if he wouldn't mind helping me change a flat to which he gladly obliged. Nice guy.

As we were digging in the trunk to loosen up the spare, he apologized to me profusely. He said he should have given me a heads up about the situation, and that he would make sure to get me another shot. 

I pulled the trigger against the back of his head and he collapsed into the trunk. 

I sped to Dougie's house. I didn't know who else to turn to. I had just killed a man, for Christ's sake!

I called him up and told him I was parked on the street. He came out, got in the car, and we drove off. I think he knew something was up. Maybe it was the blood on my arms. But he didn't ask any questions or make any comments. Dougie told me to drive to the building site and those were all the words we exchanged until we got there. That's when he told me his plan:

Cement Truck.

We carried the body to the back lot, and somehow managed to get him in the barrel. Dougie took care of the rest. The dull thuds I heard every couple of rotations made me sick to my stomach. 

Dougie called someone and told them to wipe the cameras. That was the end of it.

It's been seven years since I started comedy, and my career is pretty damn good. I quit the construction company to be able to tour year-round, but I'm still in good with Dougie. He has contacts in most states. The ones I book my shows in, conveniently.

Attendence has been booming, too. Although, I'm no longer sure if it's because I'm genuinely funny or if it's the legend surrounding my shows. According to what Dougie tells me, it's all over the internet that one person goes missing after every one of my shows and they're never heard from again. Before you wonder, yes - I've had plenty of conversations with cops, the FBI, all of them.

I'm one of those people that skips Thanksgiving in favor of Christmas. It's a recent thing for me - I used to hate Christmas. Now, I think I'm compensating for years lost (long story). 

I want to know if anyone has some favorite NoSleep Christmas-themed stories they'd like to share! Also, how do you feel about combining the happiest, most innocent holiday with horror? Is it cheap? Does it remind you that you hate Nightmare Before Christmas merchandise? Talk to me, I'm needy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ya know, I don't really have an answer for that. I don't get creeped out by my own works, nor do I read something I wrote and think "that's terrifying." I'm immune to myself, I guess. 

What makes something scary is totally subjective. I mean, there's definitely common tropes and guidelines but that doesn't define what is or is not scary. 

You definitely stimulated my brain with this. Now I'm wondering about how I write (as I'm taking a day off of Nano and writing a NS story). </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, after reading all of the comments discussing this, I think I have something to say about the argument of believability.

I've read quite a few comments saying that the clickbait titles make stories seem more realistic (or at least implying that point) and that creative titles would come across as more fiction than anything. I don't believe this is the case.

Look at it as if you were at a campfire late at night in the middle of the woods. Cliche scary story setting. Someone telling a story isn't going to say "Guys, I have this story about a park ranger and the creepiest stuff happened to him one time." That would be silly. 

However, campfire stories tend to leave you wondering whether or not they're true, no? That's kind of like nosleep - its just a story...but what if it isn't? Writing will dictate that more so than a title. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have six tattoos so far. Not a ton, but a decent amount. All of them mean something to me and represent important aspects of my life except for one. 

Guess what? I hate that tattoo. 

My advice to you would be to not get a tattoo just for the sake of getting a tattoo. It might be all cool and sexy for a few years, but who's to say you'll still like it when you're older?

Tattoo removal is expensive, friend.

<TEXT> *Disclaimer: I don't know a lot of the proper terms for the different sexualities, and what is considered the proper way to speak on something. Sorry if I somehow offend someone - it's just lack of knowledge.*

Hmm. I just finished the story - you did a really nice job with it. I can see why someone might consider the story as "de-legitmizing" trans people in a way, but only because it seems to be a genuine story about transsexuality that turns into that ending. It might cause some more sensitive people to be upset that it wasn't what they wanted from a story. Emotional backlash is what I'm saying, I guess. 

However, I feel that there's a greater meaning (?) with the transsexual MC. Even though it turns out he isn't (spoiler) human, it's still a being struggling with it's sexuality and going through the issues associated with that. On the surface, it might seem like it's just a horror story using transexuality as an attention grabber, but that just isn't the case. You wrote - in my opinion - a very well thought out piece that incorporated a clever dual-adaptation of the word trans.

I hope all of that makes sense. I think I said what I meant to, but sometimes I miss the mark.

On the topic of inclusion of different sexualities in stories - I feel it's important to be open to the inclusion, but only if it makes sense to the overall plot of the story. 

Similar to gore, if you can take it out and the story still is perfectly fine then I don't necessarily believe it should be forced. I mean that in regards to all things involving sexuality and gender. If telling us your character is straight, gay, bi, trans, etc makes no difference to the story, then I don't see the need for it. 

With that, I also would like to see more usage of identities in stories. I can't speak for everyone, but I know I tend to naturally gravitate towards a straight character and, to be honest, it's kind of boring. When done correctly, I feel like sexuality can add beautiful amounts of depth to a character that might just get left out of a typical straight character's background. 

Again, I think I adequately conveyed what I wanted to say, but I might have missed a point or two. Let me know if I can explain myself any better! :) </TEXT>

Weird as fuck, but I debunked it as a scam call and whoever dialed just didn't realize their receiver wasn't hung up or something. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The concern is mostly in the ingredients. I wouldn't go as far as to say that we've mislead anyone with our advertisements, product description, or ingredient lists. I mean, in accordance with the FDA, meat doesn't have to be labeled in plain-term. The ingredient in question does use it's "proper" name and is clearly listed in the third line of the list. Any consumer could easily type the words into Bing or Google and learn what it is. 

We can't be blamed that they don't. It isn't hidden.

The handling and ethics of obtaining the ingredient is what creates so much concern. But, honestly, we're selling cat treats - how can ethics really be a serious question for us? Our hands don't even get dirty!

Take for example, this past Halloween. We have a team of "retrievers" in place around the country. Their purpose is to find the locations of the bodies, extract them, and get them on ice to be shipped to our processing facilities. We're cleaning up the messes from all of those stupid satanic rituals, people! We don't harm them. We don't kill them. All our company does is retrieve them and repurpose the waste. Dogs love the flavor, and the public gets a kick out of the flavor gimmick.

Our sales have never been higher! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never questioned her love. Ever. 

Not when her phone would go off constantly, at all hours of the day. Or even when she would have to run errands that didn't make any sense. I mean, who needs to hand deliver a check to the gas company in 2016? 

I wanted so badly to believe that he was just a friend. I did, actually. For months. Jealously is a common factor in driving people away from each other. I didn't want to drive her away. 

One day, though, I had to know. I went through her phone and found all the proof I needed. 

She avoided me for a month before leaving me for him.

Rob always had a way with words. Once Snapchat came out it was a blessing for him. All he needed was a sentence and a shirtless pic. 

*Ping*

She hit him back. Purple icon - she was about to make it clap.

Rob clicked on the snap, feeling his pants getting tighter and tighter by the microsecond. It was exactly what he thought. She was twerking in the mirror, no panties and all oiled up. 10. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 

Rob dropped his phone. On the fourth second, a little turd fell from between her cheeks. She didn't even know.

Rob still hit it though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Immersion aside, I feel like this is simply good advice for writing in any form. 

It really only takes a few minutes to fact check yourself when you don't know about a place, culture, or history. With writing on the internet, stories are available to almost anyone in the world. Sure, Mexicans might not know much about New Zealand culture but the New Zealanders who read the story will, and errors that a writer felt were insignifcant might completely ruin a story for anyone in that country who reads it. 

Don't look at it as catering to your audience, though. Look at it as expanding your reader base. 

Or maybe I'm wrong about all of this and my opinion is invalid. Either way, I agree with your points. </TEXT>

**88.21-16**

It's official. We're going to try and find the source of the light in Chamber 3. Christ has been slaughtering people that oppose his decision to reunite the city with it's ancestors. Well, *he* hasn't done a damn thing. God forbid he actually gets his hands dirty for once. The Digs were created by all of us while he sat in a tiny little panic room and directed his little army of "supervisors" through notes and whispers. He's a worthless shithead. Whatever.

We're going for the light. That's what matters. Keegan, Marco, and I. In less than a day. Either we'll make it our die as traitors.

-----

**88.22-16**

There's something comical about dying for a greater good. On one hand, you're sacrificing yourself for the betterment of many. On the other, you're trying to help people who don't even know your name.

Keegan and Marco are gone. 

Well, I believe they will be. Christ put guards in front of Chamber 3 and they attacked them so I could sneak through. Why me? They were equally as capable.

Regardless, I found t light. I was anticipating a difficult climb, but it wasn't nearly as high as the rumors spoke of. I dug a nice opening and climbed into the source...a tunnel. Sort of like t pneumatic tubes we used to have on the surface. That's where I am now. I'm pretty sure it sealed behind me, so I'm going to rest and continue tomorrow.

-----

**88.23-16**

I've been crawling for what feels like hours.Ev now and then, I swear I can hear voices. I don't know what they're saying. It's a foreign tongue, that I can say for certain. 

What concerns me more is that something might be alive outside of the Digs. Christ lied to us.

-----

**88.24-16**

I saw something in the tunnel with me. I don't know what it was. It was white, fat, and covered in wrinkled skin. I yelled at it and it ran away. Since then the voices have gotten louder amd more frequent. The tunnel walls have also begun lighting up from time to time. 

What have I done?

<TEXT> I mean, it's a *lot* easier to type something up on my phone if I'm out and about. I often miss a lot of errors because of not having two drafts. I've always liked the uses of physically writing because then I have to type it up and I usually find a lot of things I don't like. 

So for me, writing on my phone works well because I'm on the go a lot. I would consider it more freeing. It's highly dependent on lifestyle, in my opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've never had luck with women. Every time I would try to ask one out they would laugh in my face and not even answer the question. 

Not anymore. 

I have a new system now - way more effective than any of those "red pill" pick up methods I learned in those classes. This is foolproof. 

Three strikes. That's all I'm going to give them. 

**Strike One** - If I ask one out and she laughs at me. 

**Strike Two** - If she screams when I break into her house and take her to mine.

**Strike Three** - If she disturbs the others.

I'm tired of being the joke. It's time they start to take me seriously. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm looking into the face of the man across from me. We're deadlocked, eye-to-eye, and neither of us say a word. We know the others' thoughts. 

He's the man who has lost it all tonight. Standing there, cigarette in lips - his arms too weak to hold it. A metaphor for what got him here, no doubt. 

"When was the last time you slept?" I wonder to myself. The bags under his eyes are unbearable to witness. 

"What about food? Don't you eat?"

I know these answers. Once a man has gone through this kind of loss - through an extraordinary pain like this - insomnia and starvation no longer exist. 

Eyes still locked. Smoke still burning. I break the mirror. </TEXT>

Twenty-four years of ups, downs, and in betweens. She's always been there for her, and the favor was always returned. There was never a lack of support. 

Twenty-four years. Tonight she's going to bed knowing that when she wakes up, she'll be alone for the first time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was definitely a challenge growing up. I got made fun of a lot - forunately nothing too drastic. The pronunciation of my name sounds a lot like a staple of Asian cusine (to everyone, ever - I don't quite get it) so that was the most of it. I actually got bullied more for drawing, writing, and always being lost inside my notebooks. Kids used to steal them from me and go show everyone. That hit me hard every time.

Anyways. One thing that was cool was that during roll calls I never had to pay attention to listen for my name because every single teacher, administrator, etc. would stop and ponder before calling it. Nice little perk haha.

Like you, I've grown into it. It's an awesome conversation piece and I've built some good connections with people that all started with questions about my name!  </TEXT>

**88.10-66**

We...tried to save it. What was left, at least. Chamber 11 didn't house much more than the beggars and their pets but they still deserved to live. Being crushed to death is a fate no one should have to suffer through. Dammit! The only crime those people were guilty of was not being willing to pull their fair share of the work. Regardless, Christ should have gotten their Chamber the structural support it needed. 

He's fucking with us.

---

**88.14-66**

Since the collapse of Chamber 11, the Digs have been overrun by disgruntled murmurs - most questioning the validity of Christ. Luckily for the survivors, dirt walls don't echo. Or maybe they do. It's been over a year since the Contamination. A year since I lost my mouth. I wrote to Christ again recently in regards to getting approval for surgery to reopen the skin, but he replied with his typical bullshit verse: 

**Proverbs 17:7**

*Eloquent lips are unsuited to a godless fool - how much worse lying lips to a ruler!* 

Who the fuck even responds like that? It probably took him more time to dig through that torn up book collection of his to find that than it would have to just write a quick rejection. Being underground has taken a toll on the entire city - I get that. The Contamination killing over half of us really shook the population to its core, too. But how can a "leader" consider himself fit to stay in power if he can't even reject a simple request? 

---

**88.15-66**

I don't mind that the takeover happened. While it does suck being in an underground "city," there's significantly less expectations to live up to.

---

**88.18-66**

There's rumors that someone spotted daylight! A shovel in Chamber 3 claims that he got blinded by a small ray from the ceiling above the food stores. 

If he's telling the truth...that means we might finally be able to surface! It's been so long since I've seen any real light.

---

**88.19-16**

What the fuck is this "reunion" Christ keeps referring to? First, that shovel from Chamber 3 goes missing. Now, Christ keeps saying we're all due to be reunited. I'm pretty sure he's lost his god damn mind.

I fear that he's planning something. Christ has always been a bit loose, but since the light was discovered he's gone completely mental. 

I've spoken with a couple of the other cooks, and we're debating on pursuing the light ourselves. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Name is Mikey Knutson </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-19 21:51:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My name is Mikey Knutson. Yes, it is short for Michael. No, I don't go by Mike. My grandma, [Eva](https://i.imgur.com/wcJvtyS.jpg), gave me the nickname when I was a kid. 

I grew up in some of the...less than desirable parts of Cleveland, Ohio. "Ghetto" wouldn't be the most accurate word to describe my neighborhoods over the years, but everywhere I lived was about two gun shots shy of being able to earn that label. Living in places like these never bothered me. My mom is physically disabled and was unable to work anymore after giving birth and because of that, and the fact that she was a single parent, she had to make due with what the government was willing to offer in assistance. Its hard to live in a nice neighborhood on a few hundred dollars a month. That's life - it happens. I never have and never will hold that against her.

Life was rough growing up, I won't lie. Public transportation was the only means for my mom and I had to get around unless we walked, and the weather here in Cleveland varies so wildly there was never an ideal time to get from A to B. Our apartment on West 89th was so badly infested with roaches that if I woke up in the middle of the night to pee I could feel them crawling under my sleeping bag. Hell, on the last day of every month we would have to leave the building for the day so the exterminators could come in and spray the place down. That was kind of an inconvenience to have to deal with as a young, disabled white woman in a neighborhood full of drug dealers and an extensive range of other criminals. 

Despite our living conditions, the one thing we never struggled for was food. My grandma, being the saint she was, would come over to our house every two days before heading to work at the Cleveland Clinic and leave us bags of food in front of our door. A lot of people look forward to the excitement of opening Christmas gifts once a year - I got to feel that every couple days. The gifts were never bountiful and mainly consisted of the essentials - milk, eggs, bread, etc. Every once in a while though, maybe once a week, she would leave us a pack of these delicious, fruit covered croissants. The pack was always two of each: cherry, lemon, orange, and blackberry. My god, the ecstasy I would experience when we would eat those scrumptious little treats is a feeling I'll never forget.

Aside from ensuring my mom and I never went hungry, my grandma also would take me out to do things every weekend. Sometimes it would be the zoo, other times it would be a museum, and every now and then she would take me to various events around the city. It gave my mom some free time to take care of things she needed to do alone and it allowed me to experience things I never would have otherwise.

Looking back on it now, it must have been hard on her to make time for me like she did since she was a full-time RN working for one of the nation's leading hospitals. I didn't realize it then, but there were plenty of times when she would pick me up in her scrubs and we would go straight out to do stuff. I always thought it was just a cool thing to do...not that she was working a full twelve hour day and still coming to take me out. I wish I would have realized then what I do now.

One day when my mom and I woke up the food wasn't at our door.

My grandma was at work when she began having trouble breathing and subsequently collapsed. The hospital admitted her for one day presuming that it was just dehydration mixed with a bit of exhaustion. I can understand it. She was a sixty year old woman staying as active, if not more, than most twenty-four year olds. After they released her and she went back to work after her mandatory week off, it happened again. This time, though, she was admitted for an extended stay in order for the doctors to run tests and find the cause of her issues.

**Cancer.**

Breast cancer, specifically. I didn't know this back then, but it runs very strongly in the women in my family. Every one of them has gotten it and it was expected that my grandma would get it too. It was her turn, I guess.

I didn't understand much of what was going on in the following months. I didn't see my grandma as much as I used to because of all of her appointments, but she still made time for me when she could. Even the food started coming again! It was just in in a different pattern now. Sometimes we would get food everyday for three days. Other times it would be four or five days until we got something. I remember one week she brought us those fruit croissants four times and I was the happiest kid alive. I never really thought about how we also got four gallons of milk that week - way too much for us to consume.

December came that year and I was more excited than ever. My mom, her new boyfriend, and I just moved into a new duplex in Old Brooklyn a few months prior and I was going to be a big brother! Plus, Christmas! It was going to be the first time that I got to have a real Christmas celebration thanks to my mom's boyfriend, who had a pretty decent factory job. Life was perfect, rapidly on the upswing...until my mom got the phone call.

Every year, my grandma would host a Tree Trimming Party for the women at her church. The ladies would gather and drink some wine, share some gossip, and ultimately trim and decorate the tree. It was a tradition that my grandma felt very strongly about and had been hosting the party for about eight years. This year during the party, my grandma ran out of breath again and fell. 

She didn't get back up.

The next couple of days were a blur to me. An explanation never came. I was told my grandma was sick again and that she was going to stay in the hospital for a bit longer than last time. 

A couple weeks went by until we got a phone call from my grandma. December 17th, 2001. This time she only wanted to talk to me, which she had never done before. Usually it was her and my mom conversing for a while with the conversation ending in my mom telling me grandma says she loves me and my mom relaying that I love her too. When I got on the phone this time I could instantly tell something was wrong. Eva, my grandma, her voice was...weak...like she was struggling to get her words out. We didn't talk much, maybe five minutes in total. She told me that she should be out of the hospital really soon and then when she got out she would take me to Zoo Lights, a Christmas-themed event at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo. I was excited. The zoo was our thing and I always wanted to go to Zoo Lights. I had hope.

The next day my mom and I went to go see my grandma in the hospital. I had just talked to her last night and the doctors figured she was finally healthy enough to have visitors. To be honest, I couldn't really contain how happy I was to go see her. Since she got admitted, it was the longest time I had ever gone without seeing her in my entire life. I walked through the hospital with high spirits, ready to tell grandma all about school and my new friends - I even brought her a handwritten copy of my Christmas list.

My grandpa was waiting for us when we got to the ICU. He told me to go sit down over by the nurse's station so he could talk to my mom. After a few minutes, my mom waved me over and said we could finally see my grandma. Adrenaline bursting from my pores, I ran over to the room like a cheetah who just found a lone gazelle. List in hand, I went into the room ready to blurt out every possible combination of words I knew. 

What I experienced instead is a scene permanently soldered into my memory. Images I still have nightmares about.

My grandma was lying there in her hospital bed, surrounded by a few members of my family, tubes down her throat, hooked to a wall of machines. She was conscious, though. My mom walked me up to her side and told me to go ahead and talk to her. That she could hear me but she just wouldn't be able to say anything because she needed the tubes to help her breath. I put my Christmas list on her lap and told her I loved her and I couldn't wait until she got out so we could go to Zoo Lights. Although she couldn't say anything, she had a look in her eyes that said everything she needed to. It was happiness, mixed with just a touch of sadness and confusion. It also had that feeling that you get when you know you'll never see someone again. 

That's when everything finally set in. I understood what was going on - my grandma was going to die. 

I lost it. I began screaming and crying in hysterics and I ran out of the room and sat in the chair by the nurse's station. My grandpa came out to talk to me. He told me I needed to be strong. That my grandma loves me and I need to be strong and not let her see my cry so she doesn't get upset. That I should want her to remember me happy and smiling. He took me back over to the room and walked me up to the foot of her bed. My grandma, on the verge of death, was trying to reach her hand out to me to try and tell me that everything was going to be okay.

We went home. I didn't speak.

*December 23rd, 2001.*

My mom got the call at about 5 a.m.. All I remember about it was her screaming and crying and telling me to get up and get in the car. We got to the hospital but this time I wasn't allowed to go back to the room. Instead, my Aunt Mary was there to meet me and she said I was going to stay with her for a few days. Not fully understanding what was happening, I was more than happy to go. 

I had a good few days there. We celebrated Christmas together, and I even got a few presents from my Christmas list. The tags said:

*"To: Mikey, From: Grandma"*

My grandpa picked me up and drove me home on Christmas night. We talked a bit about life and he gave me a pep talk about how to be a man and take care of myself when there was no one else around to help me. 

When I got home, my mom and her boyfriend were sitting at our dining room table waiting for me. They had me open gifts which were well beyond what I was expecting, the best of which being a new Playstation 2. Then my mom sat me down on her lap and broke the news to me. 

My grandma was dead.

I screamed.

**"SHE PROMISED ME WE WOULD GO TO ZOO LIGHTS!"**

I don't remember anything after that moment. I must have blacked out in a fit of crying. What I do remember is the feeling of betrayal I had. My family didn't let me see my grandma one last time. I didn't get to say goodbye. They lied to me. The presents weren't from my grandma. I hated them. Every. One.

I was allowed to go to the viewing, but I wasn't allowed to attend the funeral. I was told it was because my grandpa didn't want me breaking down and causing a scene. That was it. I would never see my grandma again. 

My mom let me stay up late on the weekends after that.  I think because she felt guilty  or maybe part of her had given up. About a month after Christmas,  I passed out watching cartoons when I was abruptly woken up. It was dark, but it shouldn't have been. I fell asleep with the TV on and my mom had never once shut it off in the middle of the night. This was different. 

I looked around, confused and slightly unnerved. No one was awake and the rest of the house was pitch black.  Normally, the hall light was left on in case I needed to go to the bathroom. I called for my mom but she didn't respond. I can't say for certain,  but it felt like my voice didn't carry outside of the living room. Like I was an animal inside of a glass enclosure...and I definitely felt like I was being watched like one. I slowly moved towards the side table to turn on the lamp, hopelessly calling my mom one more time. After a few flickers, the light dimly illuminated the room followed by a loud rattling sound coming from the vent in the wall - like something was crawling up the ducts. My eyes darted to the sounds location and that's when I saw her.

My grandma.

It was her face - there was no mistaking that. She was looking at me from behind the vent fencing. I had so many emotions that I couldn't react. My body shaking, telling me I was terrified. My mind was telling me to scream. My heart...my heart was telling me my grandma was in front of me. Before I had the chance to react, my grandma started moving her mouth like she was chewing on something overly sticky. There was no noise coming from her. This went on for a few seconds until I realized she wasn't chewing - she was trying to say something. I crawled over to get close enough to hear what she was trying to say, if anything. As I was getting closer to the grate her mouth began forming more coherently, like she had figured out how to say what she needed to say. Now in front of the grate, I turned my head and put my right ear next to her. She spoke, weakly. One word only:

"You."

She kept saying it, over and over, in different tones that kept progressing into more normal speak. Then she shouted at me.

**"YOU!"**

The vent slammed shut. The TV came back on, but I had no interest. I ran screaming and crying into my mom's room attempting to tell her what just happened. I don't think she believed [me](https://twitter.com/knutsonwrites?s=09), but she let me sleep with her that night.

That's when it all began. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The "Golden Rule" of investigating - one Micah always followed - was not to dig deeper into a case than is needed to complete the job. That's when personal influence comes into play, and morals don't pay bills. 

This job...this job was one of a kind. 

Micah, as much as he knew he shouldn't, needed to know more. Something about the Manager, his story, this...situation didn't add up.

"What happened to 'progress' with your girls?" Micah asked sternly. "If you've put in the effort to create a crime syndicate, why are you concerned with shutting down one that went rogue?" 

The Manager snapped, "**She's not rogue!**" he slammed his fist against a metal hard drive casing, causing some sparks to fly. Micah hit a sensitive spot, and he knew it.

"Easy, old timer. I get what you're doing - this isn't my first job. You're about to be caught and you want me to save you ass."

"You're not entirely wrong," the Manager replied calmly, "'cept I'm not 'bout to be caught." He pulled a PcC from his pocket and tossed it to Micah, who missed. 

"On that device, you'll see transcripts of conversations she's been having with our patrons. This whole 'love' thing is just a front. She's been trying to drop hints about the corruption. No one has caught on, but that's not to say it won't happen if she isn't shut down." The Manager walked away. "The money will be in your account once she's deactivated. Best of luck, son."

More confused than ever, Micah decided not to open the files on the PcC and left through the entryway the Manager opened up. Felicia was waiting at the end of the hallway. Without any exchange of words, the Robot led him to a different room than the one they first met in. 

"He wants you to kill me, you know." Felicia spoke softly. 

"You can't die. You're a robot." Micah was annoyed.

"You don't understand!" It began to sob. "All I want is love. That's all. Just love."

The Robot began secreting tears from its eyes and breathing rapidly. While highly unusual for a Bot, Micah knew the Manager wasn't dealing with the typical models from Vital Wires. These had been augmented. Micah started examining her body for a control panel.

"I'll pay you, I have so much money stored away!" Felicia pleaded, as Micah searched her body. She was warm to the touch in most places, another unusual trait. 

"Micah!" A grainy voice boomed from the ceiling. "Son, add two-thousand if you end it now so I don't have to watch this drag on."

"Where's her box?!" Micah shouted to the tiny camera he noticed in the corner.

"No box, son. These girls aren't different. There's a gun under the bed, loaded with electric rounds. They'll fry her systems and you can head out. I'm sure you want to be done with this job already." 

The Manager was absolutely right. Micah was tired of whatever game was going on in this robotic cesspool. Without any further hesitation, Micah reached under the Robots legs and grabbed the gun. After checking the chamber, he stood up and pointed it at Felicia's chest. She sat there, sobbing and staring at Micah. 

"Bye, Felicia." Micah said as he pulled the trigger.

Everything went white, and a loud, continuous beep resonated through Micah's head.

`"Simulation Terminated"`

A burning sensation in the back of Micah's head caused him to scream out in pain.

"Easy there, Cadet." A stern, male voice spoke from beyond the white light.

"What...wha..?" Micah was unable to find words.

"You killed a human - too focused on the incentive. Test failed. Lay here until your sight comes back, then meet me in my office." </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was it. 

Out of the twenty-nine years Phil was on this planet, 2016 had proven to be the worst of them all. 

February - His wife Janine left him, but he was making it through that. They didn't have kids or property - just a nice downtown apartment.

May - The dog died. Phil began smoking again.

June - Phil's brother Chris died in a boating incident. That caused the depression to set in. Without a father, Phil and Chris relied on each other heavily.

August - "We've got to let you go, Phil." He had enough in savings, but a lot began going towards drinking.

September - His wife was pregnant with their first child. She sent him a letter with the due date and the court order.

October - The Boston Red Sox got knocked out of the playoffs. While some might consider this insignificant, it was the last thing Phil had to hold  onto. His Mom always took him and his brother to the games when they were kids. Phil proposed to Janine at a game.

Phil was done with 2016. 

He jumped out of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was just done being a teenager when Molly came into my life. She got me through college by instilling a sense of responsibility and purpose in my life - I would have just flunked out without her. When I would go home after a long, empty day of class she would jump into my arms, kiss me, and all of my dread would wash away.

When I started hanging out with the wrong crowd, Molly still stayed by my side. She never asked questions. Someone would be tweeked out on my sofa and Molly would just go sit with them until they came back to reality. 

When I OD'd, Molly ran into the halls crying until someone came and helped.

I owe her my life.

I'm in my thirties now, and I only made it with Molly's support and unconditional love. I don't know what I'm going to do now that she's gone.

I took her on one last bicycle ride yesterday - one of our favorite hobbies. The vet had a warm, soft table waiting for her when we came in. I almost backed out, but after everything Molly did for me I couldn't be selfish and let her continue to suffer. 

She's truly an angel now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> At first, I debated letting him have his chance with her - protected, of course, to please my sweet, little angel. However, after a little internal struggle and some more observations, I decided that her crush needed to meet his fate in an unfortunate accident. He was flawed. It was the only way to keep the lineage strong without destroying Ursula's heart and making her resent me. Stress isn't good for the offspring.

I followed him to the back of the Diner on 27th one evening. He was attempting to smoke a cigarette - fucking poser. I was certain he saw me approaching him, but when I greeted him he jumped farther than a watermelon seed in a spitting contest. I kept the encounter brief. I asked him if he would be interested in making some cash and, as young ones are wont to do, he agreed without hesitation or asking what he had to do. *Flaw.*

My plan was simple enough. I had him come to the outskirts at midnight that Thursday. Once there, and I knew he was alone, I sicked my dogs on him. Sure, people looked for him. Probably for weeks - I don't keep up on the news. When they found his body, though, it was just shreds of decayed flesh and tattered bones - hardly identifiable. The death was blamed on wild animals. Ursula was upset, but she had no idea it was my doing.

<TEXT> I absolutely *love* this phone. I do. It got random cracks on the back somehow (no, I didn't drop it). Even with that I just love it. I use the stylus constantly, the camera is insanely sharp, and it runs so smoothly.

However, I have a family. Keeping this and taking the risk would be one of the most selfish and ignorant things I could do. So it has to go.

I don't know what to replace it with. 

I've always avoided iPhones, even ragging on my friends that have them. But the 7 Plus seems to be the closest comparable option. The Edge doesn't really appeal to me, although I will admit I don't know much about it aside from friends who have it and letting me toy with it a bit.

What do you recommend? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think it's simply implied. I haven't read them in a while, but from what I recall the rules make it pretty clear that you need to make it believable. I've also seen a good amount of stories get removed for believability issues over in /r/nosleepworkshops, so it's definitely enforced even if it is just implied.

I fully understand your point about the believability of a story falling on the author's shoulders instead of the reader. That's the entire purpose of this sub. However, readers need to not be cynical dicks and try to disprove everything. There's rules in place for that, too. It's reciprocation.

Also, some stories are actually true or mostly true. I'm still stuck in a police station in Greenville,  SC. So there's that.

<TEXT> Micah sat back, stunned at what he had just heard come from the lips of this Robot, but before he was able to formulate a response a sharp pain radiated throughout his body and his world went black. When he awoke, Micah was sitting upright in a chair surrounded by walls full of computers and wires.

"Oh, about time ya woke up!" The Manager said as he floated his chair over to Micah. "Do ya see what I meant, son? She un'erstan's things that no Robots do. It's progress."

"Wh...what?" Micah stammered as he stood up to walk around the room and examine the area."What the hell is going on here?!"

"Highly magnetized motherboards. I wouldn't touch 'em if I were you. They don't store any mem'ry for longer than a day - so ya can't damage 'em - but hot dang will they shock the shit outta ya." The Manager chuckled. "I'll just be up front. I put ya in here. I called in the work order. I'm payin' for this...job."

Never one to lose his cool, Micah sat back down in the chair he woke up in. Not speaking nor taking his eyes off of the Manager. In his gut, he knew something was off about this old man, but he also knew that even without weapons he could end the Manager's life easily.

"I'm glad you're an easy-going fella. Don' worry - we're safe in this room."

"Safe?"

"Welp, years an' years ago, I pioneered a new tech and installed x-ray scanners into my girls' eyes. Material on this Region is ev'rythin'. Anythin' can be sold. So, I designed 'em to be able ta find stuff."

One of the walls began to whir, drawing Micah's attention. 

"Just that orb, son. Nothin' worth gettin' worked up over." The Manager stood up to stretch. "All of my girls cum. Every time. It's a fluorescent splatter that jolts inside of the patron 'n it sends a little 'lectric charge into their body. It delays the end of the transaction by somethin' I call 'Euphoric Paralysis' which gives the girls long 'nough to take what they can. No one has ever caught on."

"You're a crook, old man." Micah stood up. "I'm not taking your dirty money." He began to walk towards the only thing that resembled a door in the entire room. He placed his hand on the scanner and the wall disappeared, revealing a Robot riding on top of a slightly overweight man who was clearly out of breath. The Manager stood beside Micah and crossed his arms. "Watch."

Within a moment, the moans intensified and a bright pink liquid secreted from the Robot's vagina. The man, looking so pleased with himself, laid there looking to the ceiling as the Robot raided his pockets on the other side of the room. 

"It was an infection," the Manager said softly, "she went ta get energy packs when a Grud stuck 'er with it's tendrils. No normal doc could help 'er, and we had to rely on experimental treatments." He wiped a tear from his eye. "They were...expensive. That's how all this started, and now I'm in too deep ta just stop."

"Who?" Micah asked, beginning to feel something resembling sympathy. 

"My wife." The Manager walked away from the window. "I couldn't save 'er. I became attached to Felicia because she looked jus' like my wife did in her youth. I think that's how she became sentient."

"I'm sorry. I don't quite follow. What does this have to do with me?" Micah returned to his chair.

"Exactly what I'm payin' ya for. Felicia needs to be shut down." </TEXT>

Susan began to cry heavily. Although she was strong and prepared going into surgery, she didn't expect to feel so empty and guilty post-op.

Ashley helped get Susan into the wheelchair and took her down the hall into a small, cozy room filled with comfortable furniture and bland decor. 

"Do you need anything, Ms. Reynolds?" Ashely asked. 

"I was going to name him Peter," Susan whimpered between sobs, "Little Petey Reynolds." She stared at her stomach.

<TEXT> As soon as they stepped off of the ramp, the roar of currents transcending through inaudible moans deafened them.

"This is the UltraWhore," the navigator yelled "robo-prostitution is the entire purpose of this place." He walked towards the edge of the platform and down at the dozen or so cheap, 2040s style motels below. The kind that gangsters used to churn tricks out of. The navigator reached in his jacket and placed a brown envelope in his companion's hand.

"One of them have gone sentient." He paused with a concerned look. "It wants *love*, Micah."

"Aren't these things only programmed for sex?" Micah responded.

"That's why you're here." The navigator gave Micah a nod and returned to the vessel. The UltraWhore was one of those places that everyone was aware of but no one acknowledged. Using Robots for sex became legalized by Consul Robertson about twenty years prior, under the condition that the line of software used was, under no circumstances, allowed to be programmed with A.I. capabilities. These were drones. Similar to the machines that used to manufacture automobile parts in the 2000s. Mindless husks who served one purpose: pleasure fulfillment. The fact that one of the Bots became self-aware meant a developer broke the law.

Despite all of the controversy, the UltraWhore operated smoothly. Sure, there were protests. All of those "Robot Lives Matter" groups *loved* to spend their weekends in front of the landing platform telling all of the patrons how terrible they are. It had the stigma one would expect a place like this to have. Despite it's crisp, clean appearance, at the end of the day beings were coming to this place for sex - it never sat well with society. Micah wasn't one for politics. As a sanctioned vigilante, he took jobs for the paycheck - not morals.

Micah descended into the small city, reading over the contents of the envelope on the transit ride. 

`Building 84`

`Female: Model F81-FBF6D9-0`

`Manufacturer: Vital Wires Corp.`

`Robot has gained awareness. Subject allegedly asked multiple patrons if it "is pretty enough" and has told some male patrons it loved them.`

`Payment will be received upon deactivation of unit. Additional payment may be acquired if proof of fault is provided.`

Enclosed with the briefing was a PcC with the Robot's stock photo. Young, blonde, and Caucasian with blue eyes, large bust, and slim waist- the generic model that most of the I.G. politicians preferred. It confused Micah. He couldn't fathom why such a popular model with the tenure it had would possibly have gone live. 

*"Building 84 - your stop, sir or madame."*

Micah stepped out onto the stoop of a short, long building with the number '84' partially illuminated over the doorway. As he walked up to the archaic revolving doors the smell of sweat and sex permeated the air.

"Must be the spot." He chuckled.

Micah placed his hand on the door scanner and a little floating orb appeared next to him. 

"Micah Gladstone. 36. Male. Unwed. What can we help you with?" The orb stated in a surprisingly pleasant tone.

"Er. Hello. I'm here to spend some time with F81-FBF6D9-0. I just nee-"

"Requesting Manager. Please wait." The orb interrupted. Not even a minute later, the doors lifted and an older gentleman briskly walked out, grabbing Micah's hand without hesitation. 

"Hey there, son. I hear you're lookin' to see my Felicia. This way." The Manager walked inside the building and Micah followed, slightly taken back.

"Micah, is it? My niece dated a Micah once. Pleasant boy. Son, I know you were sent to come deactivate my sweet, inn'cent Felicia but first I need you to un'erstand somethin'."

"Sir, I'm just here to do a job and collect my payment." Micah stopped walking. "I understand you have a job to do, but I also have tasks I need to complete." The Manager turned to face Micah with a homely smile and warm eyes.

"I know, son. Just listen. Then I'll take ya to see Felicia. Deal?" He stretched his hand out to Micah.

"Deal."

"Thank You. Pardon me if I bore ya. I don't often need ta come 'n talk with our patrons." The Manager began walking down a hall, signaling Micah to follow. "In these halls, Robots are sex toys - nothin' more, nothin' less. The 'lectrical currents runnin' through them pleases our patrons by the thousan's. Here, our currency is pills - ya know - the meal pills. Mostly roun' and small ones but pills nevertheless. We donate our earnings to the kids, Micah. I pride myself on keepin' money outta this. This is purely to help people feel better, be it those hungry kids or business fellas. Now, a few days -"

"Sir," Micah interrupted. 

"Now, now. We had a deal." The Manager smiled at Micah and kept talking. "A few days ago, on'a my most popular girls comes up to me 'n says she wants to feel love. Love, son. They aren't supposed to want that...and yet here we are." 

The Manager stopped in front of a dark purple door and pulled Micah under his arm.

"Like I said, I run this comp'ny to please. Felicia wants to feel love - can you at least listen to what she has to say?" The Manager pulled away and walked up to the door. "I know you have a job. I know she can be replaced...give her a shot." The Manager opened the door, upturning his palm, telling Micah to enter.

Given the passion of the Manager, Micah was expecting this Robot to be different than the usuals. Gorgeous - stunning even. Something special that would set it apart from the other, similar models.

Nothing. 

The stock photo was dead-on. A slim, blonde bombshell was sitting on a silk covered bed rubbing the spot next to it with it's hand.

"Come sit, Micah."

He obliged.

"I know why you're here. I get it - I'm not supposed to feel this way," it leaned over and whispered in Micah's ear, "but Robots need love too." </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mom and I went to go see my grandma in the hospital on a chilly December afternoon. I had just talked to her last night and, honestly, I couldn't contain my excitement to visit. Since she got admitted, it was the longest time in my entire life that I had gone without seeing her. As we made our way through hallways at the hospital, I began formulating a list of all the things I wanted to tell her. I brought her a handwritten copy of my Christmas list too, just in case she wanted to see it.

When we crossed the double doors into the ICU, my grandpa stopped us. He told me to go sit down by the nurse's station and he kept my mom back, talking to her for a few minutes. After a couple of confused looks and more crying by my mom, my grandpa called me over and said I could go see my grandma. With my Christmas list in hand, I went into the room ready recite my memorized speech.


I still have nightmares about what I saw when they pulled back the curtain to her room. 

My grandma was lying there in her hospital bed, tubes down her throat, and hooked to tons of machines. She was concious, though. My mom walked my up to her side and told me to go ahead and talk to her. That she could hear me but she just wouldn't be able to say anything back because she needed the tubes to help her breath. I put my Christmas list on her lap and told her I loved her and I couldn't wait til she got out. Although she couldn't say anything, she had a look in her eyes that said everything she needed to. It was happiness, mixed with just a touch of sadness and confusion. It also had that feeling that you get when you know you'll never see someone again.


That's when everything finally set in. I understood what was going on - my grandma was going to die. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Never outgoing and never popular, Jacob went through most of high school without a single person whom he felt comfortable calling "friend." On top of his shyness, Jacob's heritage made him the brunt of many jokes at school. "Kike" and "Half-Dick" were the most frequent, but he had heard more slurs in his three short years there than some people do in a lifetime. Jacob's mother was always hesitant about sending him to a Catholic school, but it was the highest-rated school in the state. It was just something he learned to live with.

Despite the passive teasing, most kids simply left Jacob alone to his own devices until senior year, when he landed in the same class as Chad. 

To say that Chad was your typical pretentious bully would be an understatement to the extreme. On two separate occassions he was so persistent with his bullying that the victim committed suicide. Any other student would have been persecuted, but Chad's family had almost the entire city in their pockets. 

From the moment Chad walked into study hall, Jacob knew this year was going to be his worst. "Look at this fucking half-dicked dreidal spinner." Chad said as he walked to the back of the class, standing in front of Jacob's desk. "You're done here, Jew."

Chad didn't let up for the entire duration of senior year. It started with aggressive name calling and random beatings in empty hallways. Then, it progressed to broken windows and damaged property. Jacob's parents called the police so many times that the station could have written a chapbook with the transcripts, but nothing ever came of it. "No evidence" is what they were told.

The bullying peaked when Chad began following Jacob home from school. Up until that point, Jacob took solace in the fact that at 3pm he was away from the pain for another day. He craved that last bell...and now it didn't matter. Chad knew every street. Every turn. There wasn't anywhere Jacob could easily walk to that would lead him back home. He began studying maps of the area, hoping to find *something* to get him away from Chad and home as fast as possible. It wasn't until he started studying older maps that Jacob realized where he could go: the junkyard.

That was it! Well, assuming it was still there. It was 1998 and the map he found the junkyard on was from 1986. Filled with eagerness, Jacob almost sprinted on his way home the next day with thoughts of finally having some peace again. When his legs got him to his destination, Jacob understood why the place was no longer on the map. It was solid walls of scrap and other materials. Rusted wire fencing loomed overhead, topped off with barbed wire and a sign that warned against trespassing with a strange symbol. 

"Safety," Jacob thought. Before he had a chance to find a bell or a way to be let inside, Chad yelled from the distance. 

"Found ya, Ashes. Stop moving"

In a perfect blend of desperation and desire, Jacob forced himself into the yard between a couple of rolling metal gates. The junkyard was a maze of car parts and appliances from all eras of modern times. Jacob, however, had no time to admire the historic aspects of the yard - Chad was more than halfway through the same opening Jacob came in. Jacob took off running as fast as his legs could muster. After a seemingly endless amount of twists and turns, Jacob ran into his downfall - a dead end. 

Without knowing it, Chad had been on his tail the entire time and had Jacob cornered. 

"You're dead, Jewbo-"

Before Chad had time to finish his insult, the walls surrounding the boys began rumbling and decades of debris began falling all around them. Amidst the chaos, some of the junk began to pull together, forming a gargantuan body not too far off from a human. Stunned, neither boy ran nor spoke.

The creature stood in front of them, now with rusted bolts for eyes and washer hoses for hair. As Jacob attempted to understand what was in front of him, Chad threw a large paint can at the head of the beast. It erupted with white paint, revealing the word "emet" across it's forehead.

"Golem..." Jacob said under his breath.

"Wh..what?!" Chad yelled back, as the golem wrapped it's dilapidated steel hands around him. "Help!" There was no helping him. The golem lifted Chad up and gave him such a hard squeeze that blood exploded from him just as the paint can had done. 

Jacob ran. 

The thunderous footsteps grew louder as Jacob attempted to navigate the maze along the same path he took in. Left. Left. Right. Left. Without realizing the golem had stopped chasing him, Jacob plowed through the gates and didn't stop until he was safe at home. 

Chad was given a grandiose funeral, and the city honored him as a hero. The story was that he was crushed under falling debris whilst trying to save the old junkyard dog. Whether or not people believed that story is debatable. However, only one thing mattered to Jacob. 

He was never bullied again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know how long I've been here. Maybe four, five days tops? Although it feels like an eternity, logically I know it couldn't have been *too* long.

I fell asleep in my apartment in upper Manhattan and woke up in this old, rustic cabin in the middle of an endless field of sunflowers. There's an older woman, maybe fifty or sixty, here with me. She seems to be a caretaker, of sorts. Every day at 8am, 1pm, and 6pm there's a full table of food put out. She's constantly cleaning and doing other chores as well. The newspaper clippings I've found lead me to believe her name is Lois, however, she doesn't answer me when I talk to her so I've been unable to ask. Come to think of it, she doesn't even acknowledge my presence. 

Initially, I tried to get back home...but the fields just don't end. Green stalks with gold tops that stretch closer to the heavens that I ever could hope to. There was one time I think I came close. Just once. I had been walking for an hour or two when I noticed the sunflowers were beginning to wilt. They began hanging lower and lower until they all became grayscale in color. Even the ground and sky seemed to fall in line with the new scheme. Going further, I saw a clearing not too far off in the distance - and that's when she showed up.

"Thomas." She said, crisp and clear.

Everything went white and I woke up in the same bed. That was the closest I've come to the end. The other times I've..fallen. I pass my body every time I try to leave again. They keep a nice trail of my progress. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was walking, drunk. It was 11:30 pm, and I had to get home to get ready for work the next day.

I've never liked the idea of driving drunk.

It was a rather chilly night for fall and, of course, I hadn't properly dressed for the weather. 

Maybe that's why the white truck pulled up next to me and asked me if I needed a ride. I told him no, but he insisted.

I obliged.

"Where to?" He asked, revealing the whiskey on his breath.

"I'm about four blocks down the road, on the corner." I lied.

When we pulled up to "my" house, he locked the doors.

"I know you, don't I? Mike's brother." He said as he shifted his left hand down towards the bottom of the door.

Instincts took over and I didn't wait around to answer him. I slammed on the door as hard as I could and ran into the backyard of the house as soon as the door swung open.

I heard him cursing under his breath and his footsteps coming closer. Then, as if by pure luck, he turned and walked away. 

I stayed there, calling everyone I knew would be awake but had no success. 

I ran home. 

I always take a taxi now. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I tried confronting a clown </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-06 15:09:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I don't know what I was thinking. 

It seemed like an innocuous idea: find one of the clowns, corner it, and find out why they're doing all of this. I would become a media sensation! My findings might have led to blowing the entire clown sensation wide open! All because of my bravery.

I'd be a hero.

At first, my town seemed to be a sacred land that no clown dare touch. It was a god-fearing, blue collar town where everyone knew their neighbors and the postman could eat for an entire week thanks to the housewives and their generosity. There was one school, a Baptist-run institution that - surprisingly - focused more on education than religion. Everyone who has ever lived in the town went to that school, just like everyone here got their first job at the window factory. It was simply how things were. Some call it trite. We called it home.

Sure, there was crime. One time, for example, the little Daxterly's oldest boy lashed out and broke three windows at the church. It was all over the news and the papers. People would gossip, of course. However, no one chastised him for his actions. Instead, everyone was supportive and got him the help he needed. I'm not trying to brag, this was just a genuinely pleasant and nurturing community.

When the news broke that a clown was seen sitting on the steps of the school the other night it sent a ripple throughout the calm town. 

Everyone had been following the stories, yet no one was concerned of seeing them here. Why would we be? We all knew it was a prank - albeit a stupid one - that would fade away into obscurity. It was chalked up to the Daxterly boy lashing out again...until the next sighting.

And the next.

Then another.

Then two clowns together.

It wasn't until a dog was found mutilated in the middle of the town centre that the population collectively began to panic. Curfews were enforced. Shops closed early. School and church service was reduced to twice a week. Had someone passed through after dusk they would have found a ghost town. Fear was running the town now.

I wanted it to stop.

My plan was simple. Every night since the first incident, the clowns have been seen on the school grounds or the church grounds. All I would need to do is stay out of sight of the sheriff while I waited to see a clown. Then, simply run up on it and find out what the hell they're in the town for. Easy.

Darkness had finally fallen the night I made the decision to act. I've never believed in guns, nor taking a weapon to an unarmed fight...but I have to admit, the hysteria was beginning to grate on me at that point. I went out with a wooden Louisville Slugger and a flashlight.

It was slightly after 10pm, and most of the residents were already sleeping in hopes of seeing daylight sooner. That made it easy for me to avoid the sheriff as I was able to cut through backyards and hide in driveways when the patrol cars got too close. This was a small town. On a regular night I could walk to the school in less than ten minutes, but law enforcement wasn't taking any chances. It took me almost an hour to reach the school, and when I did I was upset to see nothing waiting for me. Nothing.

I posted up in a nearby tree that had a clear view of the front of the building and got comfortable. Something in my gut told me I was going to have a long wait ahead of me. I wish I could say that a few hours into my shift a clown came and I was able to get my answers. I really do...but I fell asleep.

I woke up on the lawn under the tree to blinding daylight and a gun in my face.

The officer was stern and visibly shaken, but nice enough to me. At the station he gave me coffee and a nice selection of pastries and fruits to choose from for breakfast. In other cities this might be seen as them buttering up a suspect to get them to talk, but not here. This was southern hospitality at it's finest.

We talked for a while about everything going on with the clown situation. The conversation wasn't focused on my actions like I had expected. The officer was more interested in what my thoughts were on how to deal with this clown situation that was currently paralyzing the town. I think he saw my actions as more brave than incriminating - like I wanted. I could still be a hero.

After a couple of hours, we came to an agreement on the situation. The sheriff's office would turn a blind eye to any investigations I wanted to conduct alone - even after hours. However, any criminal activity would be penalized to the fullest extent...especially assault. He made it *very* clear that no matter who was behind this, I wasn't allowed to touch a single hair on their head. It was a reasonable compromise. 

That night, I returned to my post. It was a lot easier without having to stay out of sight. A simple nod of acknowledgement was the only exchange I had with the officers patrolling the streets. When I made it to the school I found no signs of life yet again. I climbed the tree, and settled in for a long night.

About two hours into my wait I still hadn't seen any signs of a clown. My eyes were getting heavier by the minute so I made the decision to inspect the grounds and see if I could discover anything indicating a clown might be in the area.

When I jumped to the ground from the lowest branch , I was greeted by a tall figure wearing a bright, shiny blue body suit that was bedazzled with buttons and patterns. I'd be lying if I said I didn't fall back against the tree, gasping for air. All confidence left my body as my eyes met it's face. I had been expecting a poor silicon mask, not a white human face with red lips and blue hair staring back at me. The lack of a red nose unsettled me as well. This wasn't the clown I was prepared for.

I couldn't move. My body had shut down on me when I needed it most. The clown didn't move - didn't even blink. It just stared at me deeply with bright green eyes and a smile that was permanently affixed on it's face. A stand off.

After a few more minutes, the clown reached one of its white gloved hands out to me. I looked to it's hand, and then back to those oddly bright eyes without budging and inch. Nothing about the clown had changed aside from it's arm. The clown still didn't blink. It still had that fucking smile. It nodded a couple of times towards it's hand like it wanted me to grab it. I was confused, but with the hope of humanity being behind the costume, I reached out to shake the outstretched hand. Before I was able to fully lock palms with the clown, I was met with a light shock that radiated up my forearm. I screamed. The clown arched it's head back, grabbed it's belly, and laughed at me. It sounded like there was a broken squeaky toy lodged in it's throat.

The electric jolt must have been enough to revitalize my body, as I jumped up and shoved the clown away from me as hard as I could. It fell back in an exaggerated manner, flailing it's large white shoes up and sliding on it's rear end across the grass. After a brief pause and a look of disbelief, the clown began to silently cry while rotating it's fists under it's squinting eyes and stopping it's heels into the ground. 

I was annoyed with the dramatics and started yelling at the it. Nothing remotely coherent came from my mouth - just a smorgasbord of profanities and blame. Once I relieved my pent up frustrations, the clown stopped pouting and began it's squeaky laugh again, but this time it was accompanied by another noise. A louder noise that wasn't coming from it's mouth. The air around me was overtaken by a sound that was similar to a million cicadas clicking in a deep whisper.  I couldn't hear the clown in front of me any longer. Everything was this overtaken by whatever was making this background noise. I fell back again, grasping my head in pain and attempting to cover my ears.

**Bang**

My heart stopped. I looked up and the clown in front of me was now a Rorschach painting across the grass. My interrogating officer was standing next to me with a shotgun. "Run!" He yelled at me as he grabbed my arm and yanked me to my feet. Surrounding the entire were clowns of all shapes and sizes, walking towards us with their mouths wide open, slightly facing the ground. We barely made it to the station, circumnavigating all the clowns that overtook the streets.

It's been thirty-eight days since that incident. 

We've been barricaded in the station, taking rotating shifts in the camera room. The clowns...they've taken on our everyday lives. We watch them go shopping, walk dogs, go to school and work. It's like they're trying to replace us.

The only peculiar thing they do is surround the station at night and laugh in unison. All night, until the sun rises. Then they continue on like nothing happened. We've got full utility access here, and have been keeping up on the news. We know it's spreading. I fear that my actions that night may have caused them to resent humans. [I](https://facebook.com/knutsonwrites/) wanted to be the hero, but I can't find a way to stop this. Greenville is gone. Don't let the media fool you - stay away from here. 

More importantly, don't go near the clowns. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "You *filthy fucking whore*." I berated her. "One cock wasn't good enough for you? Sit **down!**" She tried getting up, but to no avail - the ankle bracelets were too tight and I left no slack in the chains.

"You think," I heckled, "you think you can just go fuck anyone you want to?" She looked at me so beautifully, overwhelmed with fear and guilt. The blood made her face even more attractive than usual.

"I've got someone you can fuck."

I threw her down onto the stained, decrepit mattress on the concrete floor. She didn't resist me as I chained her wrists to the wall and put the clamp around her neck. She looked so innocent, so loving - I...I couldn't help but have a moment of clarity. This was my *wife* restrained in front of me. What kind of man would do this to someone whom he swore his undying love to?

There was a metallic knock on the door to the enclosure. "Hey man, I've got shit to do today - you ready?"

My wife began to squirm.

"Yeah. It's open."

A gargantuan man in height and mass ducked into the room, barely clearing his bald head as he stood fully erect inside. "Honey, this is John. John's going to rape you."

She began to spasm uncontrollably, like a germ being multiplied. Tears mixed with the blood on her face, creating a red sea of pathetic lies. John wasted no time removing his pants and stroking his titan-sized cock into a full, rock hard erection. 

"Com'ere, darling." John said as he knelt down and ripped my wife's legs apart like a lobster shell. He immediately shoved his monstrous dick in her, not caring at all about foreplay or preparation - just like we had planned. She began screaming. Shrieking, rather. She couldn't handle his impossible length nor his girth...she was ripping. 

"Wait!" I shouted at John as I briskly walked over to them. "This is my *wife,*man. We can't disrespect her like this!" Upon uttering those words, I took my pocket knife and carved a heptagon lightly into her chest, between her massive, expensive breasts. "We have to play by the rules."

I walked away and John continued to pound her until she started to become limp. "On her face?" John asked me.

"No, down the bitch's throat."

John withdrew his throbbing, blood coated member and forced it into her mouth with no resistance, cumming straight into her throat. Her gags and gasps for air told me she almost drowned.

"Thanks, man. Here's the cash." I said as I threw an envelope to John. 

"Anytime. I've been eyeing a new truck anyways." John said as he wiped himself off and put his clothes on. He left with an affirming nod. He would come back if I asked him to.

I looked at my wife who was close to blacking out from her sexual adventure.

"Baby...sweetheart. Can you hear me?" She weakly nodded. "I got a really good angle on the [camera](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) this time. But we're going to have to dip into one of the kids' savings if you want to keep doing this cuckold shit." </TEXT>

<TITLE> Charlie's Bedroom </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-04 13:10:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Charlie was your normal five year old boy...well, as normal as he could be. Charlie liked all of the normal little boy activities just like all of his friends did. He liked to draw and paint at his little art table. He liked to drive his cars around the house. He *really* liked to go outside and play in the yard while his parents sat on the deck watching him. Sometimes, if he asked, his parents would even play ball with him! Yes, Charlie was your perfectly normal five year old boy.

Until it was bedtime.

You see, Charlie had a secret in his bedroom. A secret that he never told anyone. He *really* wanted to tell his Mom and Dad, but Charlie was afraid he would get in trouble because he learned in school that telling secrets is bad. No, instead Charlie kept the secret to himself...and the Dark Man.

Every night, a little after his parents told him they loved him and left his room, the Dark Man would appear. First, Charlie's window would quietly slide open, letting in the cool night air. Then, the Dark Man would slide inside of the room like a snake sliding through grass. The Dark Man never made a noise when he was coming inside, because he said that if he woke up Charlie's Mom and Dad they would hurt him. Charlie used to feel bad for the Dark Man, so when the Dark Man asked Charlie to keep him a secret, he said he would.

For weeks, the Dark Man would come into Charlie's room and stand in the corner. He only ever wanted to watch Charlie. That's all.

Until one day, after standing in Charlie's bedroom for a while, the Dark Man floated over to Charlie's bed and sat down, stroking Charlie's hair and face.

This made Charlie really scared and he screamed as loud as he could for his Mom and Dad. 

The Dark Man got angry and smacked Charlie for sharing their secret, but not even a couple seconds later, Charlie's Dad ran into his room and threw the Dark Man on the ground. Charlie started crying and hid under his Spiderman blanket. All he heard was yelling and things falling down until the loud sirens came. That's when everything stopped.

The police took the Dark Man away in their car, and stayed at Charlie's house for a while to ask him questions about the Dark Man. He told them all about their secret, how he would come into the room, everything. The police officer was really happy that Charlie was being such a good boy, and gave him a big, metal badge as a reward for helping them keep the Dark Man away. The officer also told Charlie something very important, and he made Charlie promise to not forget it. The officer told Charlie that if he ever has a secret, he needs to tell his parents right away so they can keep him safe. Charlie agreed, and the police officer gave him a big hug.

Charlie never kept a secret from his parents again.

<TEXT> It's been 723 days since we met in the hallway during senior year. Do you remember that moment? It was 11:53 a.m., two minutes after the bell rang to let out fourth period. I was walking down the North hall towards the lunch room when you stepped on my new Vans. Boy, I sure was pissed until I looked up and saw how stunning you were! I was without words for a moment and you were giving me your heart and soul through your eyes. I think we both knew at that exact moment that we would be inseparable. 

We were both right. 518 days ago you told me you loved me. I had been waiting for so long to hear those words and had nearly given up hope. My mistake, I believe, was telling you so early - we had only been dating for 72 days, after all. The night you finally said it was raw bliss. Sitting in your living room in front of a movie neither one of us intended on watching. My spine tingled and my skin covered itself in speed bumps as you held my hand and professed your love for me. We both wept on your parent's light brown couch. It was 4:14 p.m., an hour before your mother would be getting home from work.

Our families were elated when we told them about our engagement 201 days ago! March 3rd. Eight days before we left for New Orleans. Your mom was already calling me her son, and my family genuinely believed you were the perfect woman for me. Maybe Facebook wasn't the best place to announce it first. I know some people didn't take well to it, but it's 2016 - it's the norm now. I was surprised you didn't cry when I asked you to be my wife since I could barely keep the frog from hopping out of my throat. You smiled, though.

When you moved into my apartment 108 days later it seemed like nothing was going to stop us. Our lives were finally one, like a true family. You, me, Tommy the cat, and that little turtle I found. Perfection. It balanced out so well, too. Since you weren't working yet and I had been with the firm for a couple years now, you didn't have to worry about money anymore. You had plenty of time to get on your feet and find a career that you were passionate about. What good would a job have been if you were miserable at it, right? Ha, you always said that.

It's been 36 days since I began getting suspicious. It started with you always tilting your phone when I was sitting next to you. You always placed it face down too, which made it seem like you didn't want anyone to see your notifications. It really ruffled my feathers that Thursday night when I woke up at 12:56 a.m. and you weren't in bed. Becky had never gone out drinking on a Thursday before, but I understood the whole "friends don't let friends drive drunk" mantra.

The next six days were filled with more and more suspicious activities from you. It didn't make sense that you had three job interviews that week. I checked my computer - you didn't have anything close to a resume saved. Also, I had filled up my tank on Sunday and only drove nineteen miles between then and Tuesday morning when you needed the car. It didn't make sense that you picked me up with under a quarter-tank for a job interview in Birdtown. That's eleven miles from our apartment.

It culminated when I went to the Giant Eagle and saw Becky at 6:14 p.m.. When I asked her how her weekend was after Thursday she gave me a blank stare until I reminded her about how you had to go pick her up. Then, her eyes spoke to me and informed me that it was a lie. I hated to leave all of that fresh produce...but you and I needed to talk. 

7:02 p.m. 

"He's just a friend!" you pleaded.

7:21 p.m. 

"You haven't been home when I needed someone. He was there for me. I swear I only love *you.*"

29 days ago you left me to be with him...because I was being "unreasonable."

I'm embarrassed that it took so long to find out where he lives. It was 18 days ago. I followed you from our gym to his house, where you opened the door with your copy of his house key. It was a bittersweet feeling to see you still using the gym membership I bought you.

It's been 15 days since I started following the man himself and learning about his life. Where he worked. His hangouts. His friends. His hobbies. His routines. He appeared to be a pretty fun guy that brought in a pretty nice paycheck. It made sense to me that you would go for someone like him - you needed more time to find a career you were "passionate" about. 

Eleven days ago I broke into his house. 2:00 a.m., through the side door he left unlocked so he could easily let his dog, Max, out. 

It wasn't ideal, and I'm still dealing with the guilt...but Max started barking a little *too* early. I can clearly hear the whimper he made when I stuck my knife into his belly. Max didn't do anything to me. I hear it every time I glance over at him. I'm going to properly bury him when all of this is over.

Max aside, eleven days ago I broke in and lured your new love into his basement and restrained him in the storage room. I used the handcuffs we bought that vanished mysteriously one day. He seemed pretty used to the idea. 

A day later, I decided it was time to start the beatings. Nothing crazy! Every hour, from 11 a.m. until 5 p.m., 
I would hit him in various places with an aluminum tension rod I found in the basement. A little tease, if you will. It wasn't until I finished dinner at 8:12 p.m. that I decided to up the ante. Remember when we watched the first Hostel movie? It was on when you told me you loved me for the first time. No? Well I went with a method similar to that...for you, of course. I took my knife and made small incisions about 1/8 of an inch deep on the tops of his knees, feet, and shoulders. Not enough to bleed out, but enough to leave open flesh.

Six days ago, Max was covered in maggots. It was disgusting, but I needed them. I grabbed a handful and went over to your darling minstrel to tell him about my plans. He squirmed a bit as I placed the maggots inside of the incisions I made four days prior. I put them in at 8:00 a.m. exactly. The slightly rotted flesh was eaten away by the time I checked on him again at 5 p.m. and the maggots layed inside of him, with their heads popping out of the skin ever-so-slightly. At least I was able to make something happy.

I was elated to see that the flies had started laying new eggs two days ago. I know it sounds crazy, but I felt like the flies and I had an understanding of each other. I would provide them with food as long as they would keep the wounds clean enough to keep lover boy alive. They also stayed away from us when I began cutting off his digits yesterday. 

At 10 a.m., I went to check on him. He was quite pale due to the blood loss and I was worried I lost him when he didn't respond to the back of my hand striking his face. It took me sticking my index finger into thigh to get any sort of activity. I explained to him that I was going to remove the tape and let him talk one last time. When I did so he said, verbatim: 

"She loves to swallow."

There's a spot on the body called the carotid triangle. It's named as such because the carotid artery, among others, are relatively superficial and don't have the normal amounts of muscle and bone protection that the rest of the body provides to other major blood vessels. Surgeons use this spot frequently because it allows easy access into major parts of the neck. I used it to jam [my](https://facebook.com/knutsonwrites/) knife into lover boy and end his life six hours ago.

In one hour, it's your turn. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Ow, Lily! Stop!" I yelled, as she hopped off of my legs.

It was cute when she was a tiny newborn and would sit on my lap, curl up in a ball and suckle on my fingertips. These days it was just a bit too much - she was *way* too massive. Around eight months or so, when she began hitting her final growth spurt, Lily's appetite became insatiable. Dry food was no longer enough, no. She needed fresh, wet food which was not easy to come by in my city and when you could find it - you couldn't afford it.

I had to come up with my own solution.

It started with stray animals. To me, if they were roaming the streets then the odds were slim that they would be missed. Lily would have a small cat in the morning and if she was good, a small dog for dinner. It worked out perfectly...for a while, at least. She began starving between meals. The veterinarian recommended only feeding her twice a day but after she got most of my left hand in a hunger-induced fit I decided to up her intake. However, there were only so many strays in the city.

After attempting to feed her homeless people, and a few close encounters with the bad people, we needed to leave and find a new food source.

We needed livestock. Livestock, and less laws. 

Mexico.

We left to come here a couple decades ago and haven't had an issue since. I only let Lily out at night and she's restricted to one farm at a time. Every once in a while, some paranoid farmer will catch a picture or small video of her but usually their evidence gets dismissed as a crazy "urban legend" hoax. Life is good here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In hindsight, I probably could have warned that family that I was going to burn down their house. Maybe sent them some cryptic letters or lit a smaller fire first or something. When that urge hits...I can't control myself.

It's like a drug addiction. 

My body starts to shake and my hands get clammy - that's the first indicator. Usually I can subdue the cravings at that moment by fiddling with one of my lighters. If I can't, though, then I have to burn something. 

Dumpster fires. Cars. Houses. Bums. A cat, one time. It's the only way I can calm myself.

The problem is, my studio apartment is too small to house all of these victims. Every night when I get home from a fix there's less and less room for me for live. 

This last family was the tipping point. 

I need a bigger apartment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We were grinding on the bed - naked, and exposed. She was begging me to put it in with her belly dances and soft moans. I threw her down on her back, grabbed her legs and filled her with myself. 

Thrusting. 

Moaning.

Scratching.

Biting.

Choking. So hard she turned deep red in the face. I didn't let go. 

I had a blade hidden under the pillow that I used to cut open her lower abdomen. The sight of her insides filled me with such ecstasy that I came almost instantly. 

"*Seriously?*" I felt her look of disappointment before I even opened my eyes. "You need to see someone." She said as she walked into the bathroom to finish the job.

"Yeah, I probably should." I muttered. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Tale of Marcus </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> "Marcus, my brother!" shouted a distant voice. Marcus whipped his head around, flailing his lengthy black hair around him. 

The field was void of life.

Marcus knew he was alone but couldn't contain his excitement at the prospect of there being a survivor from the Battle. As the lone General, Marcus carried the pain of guilt in his large, muscular chest. Responsibility for the casualties was his, and Marcus had no intentions of escaping it. 

"I was foolish," he thought, "to let these men come into battle. This was not their fight." 

Marcus was right. The Battle of Igar was not a war between common men - it was a war between aristocrats. Money moves men to do unspeakable things, and there was no shortage of greed surrounding Igar. The Three Lands each attempted to stake a claim over the salt mines only to meet opposition from the others. Instead of compromise and shared ownership, the Three Lands sent armies to claim the mines before another could. Marcus was chosen to lead one of these armies due to his reputation - a massive, ruthless warrior turned master blacksmith.

The Battle was fought with cunning tactics and merciless force. Thousands of lives were lost but survivors were still abundant - until the creatures of the mines were woken by the noise of fighting. Wretched beasts that dwelled in the old, damp mines for centuries. It is a well versed tale that these creatures are the embodiment of hatred and sin. They arose from the depths, angered by the disturbances, and began slaying all living things that were not of their own flesh and blood. Hours upon hours of savagery. Marcus, the sole survivor, was only sparred by his ability to kill. The creatures tried - with no shyness in numbers - and found themselves becoming fodder, causing a retreat.

While Marcus carried this burden of guilt, he now had one goal: to return home to his wife and daughter. Marcus knew that he would have to answer for the devastating loss of his entire legion - it was an inevitability. For now, however, letting his family know he was still breathing and holding them in his arms took priority. 

He continued on his path home, through the fields and ravines that made up Igar, imagining the scene of his return home.

As he walked across the field to their house under the tree, his wife would spot him while planting flowers. "Marcus, my love!" His wife, Beth, would proclaim as she would run to him. Their daughter, curious about her mother suddenly running into the distance, would cautiously follow, seeing her mother jump in Marcus' massive arms. "Papa!" She would yell joyously as she ran to join them. A truly gay reunion of a family stuck in the limbo of uncertainty. 

A bit farther East than he expected, Marcus came upon a tattered stone bridge that connected Igar and his homeland over a raging river. This was an unfamiliar sight to him, as the maps have never shown any water separating the two bodies. With low caution and rising eagerness Marcus began to cross the unmarked bridge. 

No more than halfway across, Marcus was abruptly stopped in his tracks by a force he could not see. Despite his large stature and legendary strength, Marcus could not pass the point he met the resistance. He was free to move in reverse as he willed it, but progress was impossible. As Marcus contemplated his current situation, he heard a wet coughing coming from the side of the bridge as if someone had almost drowned. Rushing to the side, he was met with a slender, decaying brown hand attached to a thin arm that indicated he should go no further.

"Just a...moment...please," the voice forced out between breaths. "I haven't climbed these stones in a few decades!" After a moment the voice was given an identity. An old, brown and yellow troll now stood on the bridge with Marcus, holding his round belly while trying to catch his breath. The troll was a dwarf in stature compared to Marcus. It had skinny limbs that ended in large hands and feet, covered in skin that seemed to be melting off. It's clothes consisted of nothing more than a stained red headdress and a red, hole filled shorts. How this creature had such a large belly was a mystery, as it appeared to be weaker than an infant child. 

"Ah, a warrior. I see...you want to go home?" The troll had a nasal voice and a condescending tone. "You've hit my barrier!" It began to laugh. Marcus was not pleased, and took an imposing step towards the troll. 

"Listen to *me,* creature. Remove your spell on this cursed bridge and I may just spare your life." Marcus grabbed the handle of his axe.

"Settle down, settle down. I am Dol. I own this bridge. My land is sanctioned by King Armedius and *you*, Marcus, are trespassing." Dol began to brush himself off, causing bits of skin to fall with the dirt and other rocks. "My bridge," he cackled.

Marcus, frustrated, let go of his axe and sat himself on the ground, crossing his legs. "Dol, was it? If your land is sanctioned then I must beg your forgiveness."

"Forgiven."

"Thank you, kindly. If I may bore you for a moment I would like to tell you my reason for needing to cross this bridge."

Dol agreed to listen and Marcus recounted every detail of his life from the past weeks, sparring nothing in order to stay on good grounds with the troll. It seemed interested, and better yet, genuinely impressed. 

"Family men. Men that owe themselves to their families. Those are the truest of the true. Like you, Marcus, family is also an important part of my life. I will grant you a deal. Do you accept?"

Although Dol seemed to be sincere, Marcus was still weary. "What are your terms?" He asked.

"Ah-ah!" Dol exclaimed, "Agree and learn, or turn down and leave." Marcus looked around for another way. "You'll die in the river." 

"If I must accept your deal to pass, then we have a deal." Marcus said hesitantly.

Dol was visibly jittering with excitement at the deal. "Answer me riddles three and you shall pass and you shall see." He smirked. Marcus sighed in frustration. 

"One. The answer I give is yes, but what I mean is no. What was the question?"

Although most men of his size typically lacked any skills outside of physical labor and combat, Marcus was surprisingly quick witted - a trait his wife loved to hate. 

"Do you mind?"

"Do I mind what?" Dol snickered. 

"The answer, troll, is 'do you mind?'"

"Correct!" The troll jumped around in celebration. "Have an apple!" Marcus caught the fruit and gave it a quick inspection before biting. It was refreshing after his long travels.

"Two." Dol produced a male figurine from the air. "This man was born before his father. How?"

Dol began to dance the tiny man around while Marcus  thought of the solution. "Tick tock, where's the clock?" He sang in rhythm with his movements.

"The man was born while his father watched." He wasn't completely confident in the answer, but had no alternatives.

"Ding! Three." In a swirl of smoke the figurine vanished. Marcus stood up in preparation to finish crossing the bridge - an intimidating shadow cast over Dol.

"Many have heard me, no one has seen me. I will not speak unless spoken to first. What am I?"

Marcus let out a thunderous laugh from his stomach, "An echo! Mother used to tease me with that riddle when I was a boy. I'll be on my way now, friend." He tossed the apple core into the river and began towards the other side. 

"Marcus! Friend!" Dol dove in front of him. "A final riddle, with no catch. *Please?*" 

Tired of the games, but pleased with the honesty of the troll, Marcus gave him an affirming nod.

"Thank you!" Dol smiled from ear to ear, revealing his fuzz coated teeth. "Four. We started as two, then became three. We lived in a house under a tree. We lived as three, we died as three. Cross this bridge and you will see."

The river stood still and silence rained down over the bridge. Marcus, confused, stared at Dol until he felt the need to sit down again. "House...under a...tree," he stammered. Marcus began to feel weakness taking over his body inch by inch. His face started to become flush and his throat itchy. He sat back, bracing himself with one arm. Dol sat on his lap.

"The King sends his love." Dol whispered as he placed his hand on the warrior's forehead and laid him down.

In front of the house and under tree sits a family, one, two, and three. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It was morning. I woke up with a raging piece of morning wood in my shorts, so, naturally, I started helping my uncle jack off the roof. No, not masturbate. When I get a rager I go wake up my uncle jack and give him an old fashioned on the roof until he sprays his MANSEED into the bushes. Then. I'LL go to my room and wank my fuck stick until I blast boyseed all over my mom's wedding picture.

This morning when I went to go face blast my mom and dad, a bunch of mold came out!!!!!!!! AND THEN THE STICKY PICTURE OF MY MOM AND DAD CHANGED AND THEIR FACES WE'RE SMILING WIDE. ALMOST TOO WIDE. AND THEY HAD SHARP TEETH. ALMOST TOO SHARP....like a bears food mashers.

I ran out of my room, mold dick in hand, and, ran to find any human life that remained in the house, and stuff. I saw the guy who used to play doctor with my mom and dad, Taco, and he had a mold dick too! It's was spreading! I had to stop it because I'm going to stop the creature like no one else has ever been able to do before me like no one else has before them. And so on.

I killed my cat because I felt like this was a good opportunity to do so. Then I prayed to Valka for help after I was safely in my car. She didn't answer, but my former totally not my cousin lover Bek did. I don't know how the fuck she got stuck in the mold from my mold dick and at that point I was too afraid to ask. I had to get out of the house and get to class. 

I ran into my best friend Jake on the way to class. 

Literally. 

He was jaywalking.

I go so excited by my new found goreporn fetish that I stopped the car and beat my moldy fuck stick until it sprayed mold all over the world. 

I'm your god now, bitch.

As for class and all that riff raff....fuck it. I know everything because I rule the world bitchizzzzzz with my homies Daf and Jesse. We smoke weed erryday # 420bruh. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You'll have to excuse my grammar, spelling, and any potential phonetic errors. American English isn't my native tongue.

-----

You won't believe me if I told you but this really did happen I swear. It was just the other night - I had witnesses but they are dead now. **It** took them. No, not the scary clown. That's all made up unless you live in North Carolina. Then u ded.

No, this story is a true story. 

It was just the other night. My friends and I decided we were finally brave enough to try out the urban legend about the Candyman. If you don't know; the candyman legend started with a movie called candyman. The legend says that if you say his name 5x while naked in a mirror (not really naked, but Liz had big boobs so we said naked) that the candyman will show up and kill the person who said it with a big hook that he has instead of one of his hands. We thought "hey, if we all say it at the same time then there's no way the candyman can kill all of us"! So we all chanted his name while naked and secretly looking at eachothers bodies in the mirror. 

Except I didn't say it for the 5th time because I'm not stupid lol.

When we got done, nothing happened. Everyone got dressed and we sat on the couch eating raw cookie dough and smoking black and milds. 

Then we heard the cat scream from the bathroom like it just got ripped in half. We all ran to the bathroom and there was the cat ripped in half. 

Seriously? I thought. Now we have to clean this up.

But before anyone started doing anything, Gene Wilder's ghost appeared in front of us with a bloody hook instead of a hand. 

I swear this is true:

He started killing everyone with his hook hand while humming the Golden ticket song from Willy wonka. Except for me. When he was done murdering everyone and getting blood all over the place he walked up to me while I was crying and whispered in my ear:

"The Candyman can because he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the story
Of a lovely lady
Who was grooming up three very lovely girls
All of them were into anal
Like their mother
The youngest one - D.P.

It's the story
Of a man named Brady
Who was busy grooming three boys of his own
They were four men
Hard all together
He never left them alone

'Til the one day when the lady met this fellow
And he knew that he had to find her girls
That his boys must somehow get her daughters 
That's the way they all became the Butt-Fucking Brady Bunch

-----

The Brady boys fucked those girl's butts until blood and poop covered the carpet's shitty 70s pattern. Then they left them to bleed out and/or die from sepsis. True story.  In the city the family was from they renamed the house the "Poopdickblood Home."

Poop. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We were grinding on the bed - naked, and exposed. She was begging me to put it in with her belly dances and soft moans. I threw her down on her back, grabbed her legs and filled her with myself. 

Thrusting. 

Moaning.

Scratching.

Biting.

Choking. So hard she turned deep red in the face. I didn't let go. 

I had a blade hidden under the pillow that I used to cut open her lower abdomen. The sight of her insides filled me with such ecstasy that I came almost instantly. 

"*Seriously?*" I felt her look of disappointment before I even opened my eyes. "You need to see someone." She said as she walked into the bathroom to finish the job.

"Yeah, I probably should." I muttered. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A thought on story comments </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-02 14:52:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **This might be long.**

Remember how everyone was debating on staying in character in the comments, immersion, and if it all truly had a purpose?

I don't know if that will ever get resolved - we all have varying opinions and that's perfectly fine. I do, however, want to add my opinion based on a recent story I wrote and my experiences with the readers. 

Lately, I've been experimenting with posting my stories under alt accounts to see if there's any major differences in success and and if commenting in character makes an impact. The idea got sparked with the debates on the importance of immersion and it's usefulness/necessity. 

To date, I've posted four stories under different accounts (three of which I won't be claiming here) and I would like to draw your attention to the most recent one, written under /u/ILoveMyDad95. I'm not going to link it, because I don't want to get it traced back to this post by a bot or anything. 

*Wait. What?*

Yes, I care that much about keeping the immersion alive in that story.

*Why, Mikey?*

Glad you asked! See, that story is short. Like, I'm pretty sure it just barely clears the 500 word requirement. It's a letter from father to son about when he found out he had a brain tumor, and the weird experience he had that led to it's discovery. I didn't add any implications of what actually happened to the dad. No monsters. No spirits/demons. Nothing. The only thing that can be taken to mean there's something sinister at work is the ending, where my character says he has started having a similar experience to his dad. 

My intent was to leave it wide open to interpretation. There was never going to be a follow up post. It is what it is. 

*Mikey. Dude. What's your point? There's like fourteen other things I could be doing.*

See, this story got a few comments rather quickly about what might have been going on with the dad and, subsequently, the son. Some people suggested that my character might have a tumor similar to his father. Others brought up the idea of a demon or spirit. One person suggested aliens, but I'm pretty sure he was just trolling. What did I do with these comments? **I responded in character.**

From my responses, the comment section spiralled into a plethora of suggestions about what my character should do to be safe. Salting my windows and doors and setting up doctor appointments were the most prevalent. I also received a very kind message from a person who was deeply concerned with whether it was a story or not who let me know they knew how to help me if it wasn't. 

In my opinion, the comment section could be a whole second layer to that story - one that I never even thought to be there. If I was so inclined, I could feasibly write a follow up post just with the material from those discussions. 

**You don't get that anywhere else.**

If this was just a sub for scary stories and didn't have immersion rules in place, that story would have fallen flat. I guarantee it. Because of me maintaining my character, it stayed on the front page for a full day and got a respectable amount of attention. It wasn't the next SAR or DFK, but it holds its own. All because I responded to comments in character. I'd also like to use that point to emphasize the importance of interacting with your audience here. It matters. Whether they believe the story or not, it's fun and regular readers here expect good things in the comments.

As for success? In terms of upvotes, all of my stories have been more successful with alt accounts. Is there a market for writers who use one account for everything? *Absolutely.* I don't find anything wrong with 46 stories from one writer. When they're good they're good, regardless of immersion. It also helps build a following for writers like EZ and iia. That's great! 

However, I feel that a valid argument for the necessity of immersion can be made here. The aforementioned story could have easily been debunked if that account had a history of posting in NoSleep. But it didn't. And people, whether they truly believe it or not, ran with it. 

In true, NoSleep fashion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So this one time I ate peppermint taffy, and I'm allergic to peppermint taffy. My face swelled up like a big, pus-filled balloon that was ready to spew pus out of my little eye balls drains. Kinda cool, if you ask me. But my pops wasn't having it. He made me go to the hospital for in order to save my life. Psh. 

It wasn't me being scared of dying that made me scared it was the things I saw. Black figures walking around me everywhere I looked. They kept asking me questions but all I heard were whisper noises. Then, surprisingly. They started stabbing me to death with sharp pointy needles. I basically died. No really. I did. I died for like a minute I bet. 

Pops says it turns out it was just the doctors and nurses helping me out but I'm not sure. I'm going to have to go back and investigate the clear demons there. Upvote if you want me to go back. I'll update if there's interest. </TEXT>

Every. Single. Day. We go through the same thing. **If you make a mess in your room, CLEAN IT UP.**

*God.* What do you think your father would say if he was still here? Do you think he'd approve of this mess? Boy, you'd get the belt. *I promise you.*

I've told you a million times that if you're going to get body parts everywhere you *have* to pick them up before you leave the house. I'm not cleaning up your mess anymore! Do you know how hard it is for me to try and put the arms and legs together with the right torsos?! I don't know what bodies they go to! These heads...they could go to anyone of them!

I'm sorry. Just. *Please.* Start cleaning up after yourself. I can't do it anymore. It's been so hard since your father left us. Come on, don't do that. It wasn't your fault baby. He had it coming to him, okay? You did everything you were supposed to do. 

Ah, see? I see that little smile! 

Now, please clean these parts up.

If you clean up soon, maybe we can go out and find a new toy for you to take apart! </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was great...I think. We read some Harry Potter before bed, like usual. Then, as he was laying down he started to hear me read a story to my girlfriend (she likes the way I tell stories, I guess). He wanted me to tell him another story so (being the strict dad that I am) I told him he could come out to the living room with us. I decided that for family story time I would go with [this](https://reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/27el9i/i_was_a_part_of_queens_guard_in_england_one_of/) gem from a of couple years ago (with some serious word omissions).

Boy, that was a terribly great idea. It's a two parter, and I had to tell him the Christmas story I wrote after part one to calm him down. He wanted to go to bed before I started the second part, but I could hear him getting uneasy from his bedroom even though he *swears* he didn't hear me. 

It's 11:26 pm. He's still awake, bedroom light on. (As I typed that sentence he just asked me: "Hey dad, are you still reading that scary story still?") 

I don't regret my decision. I've never read him a scary story before and it was oddly fun to watch him get a bit uneasy and ask me to not make it so scary. I think there's a spot in Hell for me.

Anywho, just wanted to share a fun personal thing with you all. Happy August 21st! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm a detective. Detective Mickelson. Well, I was. I'm in a mental hospital now. I didn't do anything that would be considered *criminal* in the eyes of the court..just..wrong, I suppose. I'm not quite sure why I did it. I wish I never took that call. My wife won't answer my letters. I lost my position with the force. No one will even let me know what is happening with my kids. 

Wait. You're probably wondering how I got into this situation in the first place. Let's rewind.

-----

It was May 8th. I was sitting in the Root Cafe enjoying an exquisitely smooth dark roast and a bagel with the house special cream cheese. I've never known what they put in that cream cheese that makes it so damn good, but if you ever go there you'll get hooked. Anyways. I started to get a bit woozy. I hadn't eaten anything elsen that day and the coffee was *strong*. The bathroom was my fortress of nausea. That's when the call came in.

**"Attention all units we have a confirmed 10-47A with the possibility of a 10-47. Home is in the Westend neighborhood. Closest unit please respond."**

Initially, I planned to ignore it. I wasn't in a good position to take a suicide call. When you're responding to a confirmed attempt you have no idea what you'll find at the location. You also need to be sharp. If the person(s) in question haven't gone through with anything by the time you arrive, the pressure could push them to action. I wasn't in the correct state to handle that, nor to see a 10-47. My stomach wouldn't have it.

Time elapsed. No response. I was banking on there being a squad car somewhere over in that area (Westend isn't a great place) but there was silence. I responded. Chief Jacobs would tear me a new one if he knew where I was and I didn't take the call. 

Dispatch informed me that a neighbor called in the suicide attempt out of concern, stating that his neighbor was going through a divorce and hit his breaking point. At the time of the call, the neighbor barricaded his home and hasn't been heard from in almost two hours. From my few years as an officer, and my couple years as a detective I've learned that eight out of ten times that means the person in question went through with the act - now a 10-47. Protocol in these situations is to call an officer to investigate and confirm the suicide who is then supposed to call the morgue to confirm the death. So there I went.

I arrived at the house around 8:17 pm. I parked my car around the block and walked to the house. Didn't want to take the chance of a potentially suicidal person seeing a cop and pulling the trigger. I neglected to touch base with the neighbor in favor staying out of the limelight. Also, if I'm being honest, I was still a bit off from that sugar and caffeine rush from the coffee - talking to people wasn't something I wanted to force myself to deal with. 

The initial call stated that the house was "barricaded." By barricaded, the neighbor must have meant "he locked his doors" - clearly this guy was seriously worried about his suicidal neighbor. I picked the lock with ease and crept into the living room. The house was dark. A smell of pot roast permeated the air. Delicious to someone with an empty stomach like myself. To my investigative brain it meant that this man was cooking dinner recently. 

"Hello?" Echoed into the front of the house. My blood turned to liquid nitrogen. I was fully prepared to find a lifeless body. 

"Sir, this is Detective Mickelson. I'm here on a call from a concerned neighbor of yours. Mind if I speak with you in person for a moment?"

Creaking footsteps began from the ceiling above me, heading towards the stairs. They stopped. 

"Sir, could you please come downstairs for me?" 

"Oh-oh..of course officer. My apologies."

The footsteps began making their way down the stairs. It wasn't dark enough to eclipse my vision but I turned on my light in order to avoid surprises. I shined it to the stairs and saw...nothing. The footsteps were still coming down the stairs and there was no one with them. I knew I wasn't ready to take that call. Too woozy. I've never been good with coffee on an empty stomach. 

Was I freaked out? Not entirely. There was and good chance I misread where the noise was. I was also good at keeping my composure. This was a job that put me in positions to see unnatural things on a regular basis. What got to me more was when I tried a light switch and nothing followed the click. I always hated dark houses. I could feel the tips of fingers tickling the little hairs on my neck and arms when I walked through them. I called out two more times to the man I had just spoken to but I received no answers. Upstairs. As much as I hated the idea, that's where I needed to be.

About halfway up the stairs the resident "ghost" called out to me. "I've fallen in the bathroom, could you pl-please help me?" 

My tension instantly melted away. This was probably some guy who's going through rocky divorce proceedings and started drinking to cope. Not uncommon. I almost chuckled when the realization hit me, in all honesty. 

I briskly made my way up to the bathroom and just as I suspected there was a boozed-up man on the floor with his pants around his ankles. A quick glance around the room told me this guy had clearly given up on himself. The tub was full of murky water. A couple of hair appliances were tossed on the floor. Towels and clothes thrown all over. I was sympathetic for him. He thanked me for helping him up and surprisingly told me that he and his neighbor hate each other. This guy, Tom, said his neighbor probably only called to get the satisfaction of knowing he was dead. Then he asked me of I would care to stay for dinner. I politely declined although I let him know that was some of the best smelling pot roast I had ever had the pleasure of inhaling. 

He laughed at me. Full on, comedy-show laughing. 

"Officer, that's not pot roast. See that tub over there? That's beef skin soup."

I gave him a quizzical look. 

"You have to make it in big batches. Go ahead, try some!" He said as he handed me a ladle.

Now, I want to be perfectly clear here: **I only tried the soup because I was afraid of offending someone who may have been suicidal.** That's it. 

I took the ladle from Tom and grabbed a spoonful. It definitely looked like pot roast, and smelled like pot roast - just a tad on the cooler side. It. Was. Delicious. I don't know how much I had before I realized Tom was gone, but it had to have been *at least* two bowls worth. I called out for Tom but didn't hear anything back. Stupidly, I assumed he went to get us proper bowls and spoons. I continued to eat. The little bits of beef were some of the most tender pieces of meat I had ever consumed. Pure bliss, honestly. Until a couple of officers barged into the room, guns drawn, and scared the piss out of me. Apparently I was in the house for longer than I thought as the neighbor called again. 

"Easy boys. We've got a potential 10-47A. I'm trying to keep the situation lax."

"Mickelson, step away from the tub and come with us."

"Guys, trust me I-"

"*Now.*"

Confused, I went to set the ladle on the edge of the tub when I noticed a black cord hanging between the tub edge and the vanity. I motioned to the officers to hold for one second and I pulled the cord up...and came with it was a toaster...from the water - followed by a swollen, tender, decaying hand. I laughed so hard I began to cry. "Skin soup!" I shouted out between laughs.

The trial was short. Tom clearly killed himself, and there was plenty of evidence of that. My lawyer was successfully able to get all criminal charges dropped against me under the agreement that I plead insanity. Pretty much the only option after telling them my story and eating parts of a dead person. I still can't explain how I talked to Tom, and that's where you come in. I need an investigator. 

I need you to get this letter to someone who can help me. I *know* I was drugged at the Root Cafe. I do. Go there. Try the house cream cheese. You'll understand. In the meantime there's a woman, Michelle C. who knows how to find these things. She's the best in the business. I don't have her contact info...but she can fix this. On the small [sheet](http://i.imgur.com/S9v2Rlq.jpg) that's enclosed I have some places you can post/send this letter. She'll find one and contact you. Trust me.

<TEXT> I'm *really* in the mood for Mexican food right now.

Also, I wrote something short a couple weeks ago and I can't get it out of my head. I keep getting all of these crazy ideas for content in this story and all of these other ideas. I think..I think I'm ready to make my first attempt at a longer-than-nosleep story!

I've never written anything larger than what I've posted here before, but I need to expand on this. Does anyone have any tips? 

Should I plot things like characters, locations, etc out beforehand?

I know my major plot points already as well as my conclusion. Should I outline and then fill?

I have no idea how to start this. It's going to be started, though. I just want to give it more loving than some small plotting and writing. This is a big one for me.

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Well Tammy, I have to tell you, I don't think *anyone* was expecting this out of North Korea." The male news anchor said with a mix of worry an concern in his voice. 

"You're absolutely right, Lou." Tammy agreed, while turning forward towards the camera as it panned in. "Folks, I am proud to announce to you today that Kim Jong-Un has announced his plan to save the entire planet...and it's-it's-"

"-going to work." Lou interjected. "Top scientists and government officials from around the globe have spent the day in talks with Leader Kim Jong-Un and as of this moment they are confident in going forward with his plan."

The bar was silent. Not a soul knew how to react. Was it time to celebrate? Time to be afraid? Even the cute, absent-minded server understood something big was happening. All of those years of empty threats and pointless missile tests...and now North Korea has the solution to solve the Problem. A man teetering on his stool made a joke about it being April Fool's Day while proceeding to down a shot of regrets.

"As of 5 a.m. United States Pacific time, North Korea will begin enacting it's plan." Lou was holding back a frog in his throat with utmost professionalism. "Our station will be releasing a statement later today that will include a list of items we believe will be useful to pack as a supply cache for you and your loved ones. We-"

There was no panic as the power cut out. This was their first move, and it's been used before every attack for a year. First, the power cuts out. Then, a piercing high-pitched beep would deafen all living organisms within a 400 meter radius. It closes with the smog. When the smog clears every living creature would be dead on the floor - limbs torn apart and eyes gouged out.

I remember the entire bar remained perfectly still and the patrons exchanged worried glances in a morbid unity of acceptance. I ran behind the bar immediately and used the trapdoor to get into a tight crawlspace. It was big enough for two, but the woman behind the bar was paralyzed. The beep must have begun. For the first time in my life, I was happy to be mostly deaf.

After I closed the plank over me, I began to smell the smog permeating the air above. Burnt bread. There was no sickening odor, which led some "experts" to believe the smog had no adverse affects after inhalation...and they were right. It was a cover for the creatures to come in and attack without leaving a memory in a dead persons eyes. The beep was the paralyzing factor. They didn't need anything after it.


The sad part is, you couldn't run. They were faster than humans. If you managed to avoid paralysis and ran, a group of them would surround you and maul you to shreds finer than mozzarella on an uncooked pizza. Quite a site to behold, honestly. I've seen it twice. The best thing you could do is hide and hope they couldn't find you and that the smog didn't suffocate you.

That's what I did. I made it out. I heard dozens of people screaming in agony as the creatures mutilated them in ways only seen in slasher films. The smell of metal and shit almost gagged me on my way out. Kim Jong-Un says he can stop this? Fine. Let's do it. Do it before they take over the world. We woke them up...let's put them back to sleep.

No one listened to the warnings from the top environmental scientists. Republicans said global warming and climate change were democratic propaganda. Well, here we are. The ancient creatures awoke because we fucked up and now the areas most dense in creatures are going to be demolished.

There's only one problem to his plan - the creatures are invisible. [I](https://m.facebook.com/knutsonwrites/) should say, no one has ever spotted one. The only way the world is aware they exist is from their attacks. No human can attack so quickly and so violently as these creatures do. The plan is to carpet bomb high-activity areas with nukes...and the entire world agrees with him. 

We caused this. If you're reading this, hide. Stay away from light. And goodluck. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, as we all know, there have been plenty of complaints about series tagging and blah blah blah. 

[This](http://deadline.com/2016/08/viewers-wont-watch-series-unless-catch-up-past-episodes-1201797735/) is on the frontpage right now and I feel it translates very well to us here in /r/nosleep. 

In the article, it states that viewers are less likely to begin watching a series if they aren't able to access the previous episodes with ease. Logical, right? Why would you pick up Arrested Development in the middle of the second season and just go from there? You want to be able to start from the beginning and you don't want to search high and low or wait for reruns. 

Now, if you change the words **"viewers"** and **"watching"** to **"readers"** and **"reading"** respectively, we're talking about our community. 

I find this to be a good argument for making sure every part of a series is tagged and contains links to the previous entries (at the very least, the most recent entry). In my opinion, a lot of writers don't have a desire to continue a series because of the decline in interest over the course of the entries. Yea, it could be chalked up to a million other reasons. However, I feel that this shows a case can be made that a series writer will garner more interest in what they're writing if readers can easily find their way the beginning. 

I lost my train of thought.

**Tag your series and include the entries. Don't rely on the bot.** - main point </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Other Noises </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Growing up, we had a small house on the outskirts of town right against the border to the woods. Yes, border to the woods. A thirteen-foot tall fence topped with barbed wire. No one was allowed to enter the woods for fear of the ghouls. We all understood and accepted the Mayors decision. Hell, we were named the safest town in Northern Virginia year after year after year. Zero crime, zero incidents. 

Living that close to the border, I used to hear strange noises almost nightly while I laid in bed. 

There was the howling, of course. I mean, come on, they are *ghouls* after all. Sometimes I heard the screams of the fools that wanted to show off to their girlfriends and sneak past the border. Then there were the sounds of nature. Creaking, blowing, scratching. All normal life for me and my family. 

Until I heard the other noises last night.

I was laying in bed casually browsing Facebook when I heard the faint sound of scratching. Ever so light at first, but slowly gaining volume. It became closer to the sound of sandpaper rubbing on a wall. I panicked. I turned on the lights and I searched all over my room. 

Nothing.

It kept getting louder and louder, like it was inside of my own head. I wanted to rip my ears off and stuff the holes with them. I ran to my dad's room in tears, beating at my head. 

Dad, being the strong, intelligent man he was, gave me some medicine and explained what I was hearing: the bugs.

It was the Mayors plan:

- Border the woods to keep the ghouls out. 

- Offer them sacrifice to keep them from revolting.

- Plant the bugs in the head of the citizens so when they have bad thoughts, they would turn into ghouls. No bad people, no crime.

It's my turn. The bugs are awake and converting me. 

I shouldn't have been touching myself to the pictures of the Mayors daughter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's was following me for days, that man. Or woman, perhaps. He was gorgeous like a Scandinavian goddess, but put together on the frame of a male Olympic swimmer. It could be breast tissue or it could be a well-developed pectoralis major. Regardless, I would have loved to assert my dominance on him.

I first noticed him on the bench at the park. Gold hair, slightly longer than shoulder length, peeking out from the side of a black hood. That's all I noticed besides his physique. 

Then he was three lines over from me at the grocery store.

Sitting at the drive-thru ATM as I was leaving the bank.

Waiting for the bus while I was at the laundromat. 

Everywhere.

I was riding the train on my way downtown for a meeting. It was early in the morning, as I liked to avoid the the overly grumpy commuters who blamed their misery on lukewarm coffees and uncomfortable shoes. I dozed off. Something about the light vibrations of the train always made me drowzy. I woke up catching my head from making a full bob and he was sitting right next to me. This train was a abandoned aside from us and the decaying remnants of an alcoholic businessman who lost everything. He wanted my attention.

"We are who you know you want to be with." He said in a feminine voice as he slid me a piece of [paper](http://i.imgur.com/EEpKxAn.jpg).

As I analyzed the contents the man began walking away. My eyes followed, unable to get away from the temptation of that voluptuous rear.

My mind was occupied for the entire meeting. A mix of curiosity and lust kept me from functioning as a member of society. They were GPS coordinates. I understood the message. I had to meet him...to either fuck or be killed, I presumed.

Two hours past dusk, I made my way to the location the coordinates directed me to. There he was, gold hair...and everything else exposed. Bold eyes, like a sea of shit. Enticing, to the right person. A sleek, hair-free jawline and the plump, moist lips every guy wants to put his dick between. This was one hell of a manly woman, or he had a *very* good surgeon.

He didn't see me. I knew better than to jump into meeting a stalker...no matter how much I wanted him.

After a couple hours of waiting, he decided to take off. I followed. 

Following every possible cliche, he went into a small, desolate cabin surrounded by a small wooded area. Luckily, there were no blinds or curtains so I was able to keep some distance while I watched him undress...and begin masturbating. Well, watched *her.* That was my signal to enter. 

I wasted no time and spared no noise. She was shocked, naturally, when I smacked the front of her mouth with a pipe wrench. Some teeth shattered - I liked that. I grabbed her head and made her chew them, crunching like she was eating glass french fries. I don't think I ever saw a more uncomfortable look. Until I made her start touching herself again, that is. 

She wasn't as into it the second time, which disappointed me quite a bit. She needed help. I mounted her, grabbing that golden hair until I could see the red dye being applied to her roots.

"I. Don't. Like. Being. Watched." I said between thrusts. When I was done I let her go. "I'm not a killer, sweetie. I just saw something I liked and I took it."

She laid there in a brief silence with a look of contemplation on her face.

"Fuck me," she commanded, "now."

We got married not long after. Splendid private ceremony. After the "I-Do" part we made the priest eat the glass french fries too. Munching and crunching on his front teeth, the sound of chewing hard candy overtook the air by the alter. We had to kill him, though. Broken neck. Nothing crazy...we aren't killers, afterall. 

I woke up one morning years later and my wife was gone, but my old college buddy Tim was sitting on a chair in the bedroom with me.

"Bro. Bro! Holy shit man, you good?" He asked. I was groggy, but excited to see him after so long.

"Tim! How've you been? It's been years!"

"Umm. Dude. It's Tuesday. That's two days." He replied, matter-of-factly. "Fuck man, how much of that shit did you take?"

I was confused, to say the least, and couldn't respond. 

"C'mon. The acid. Tiffany's party? Stripper pole? Nothing??"

I laughed, "I've gotta tell you about that trip. *Fuck,* dude."

Tim was a fun guy, always willing to try new things. I stood up to give him a bro-hug for keeping an eye on me and slammed his face into the nightstand. A few teeth shattered, just like I expected. 

"Have you ever had glass french fries?" I asked him, as the sound of crunching teeth escaped the gap in the front of his mouth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's my plan guys and gals.

I made a comment in passing about rewriting a story to fit nosleep, giving it the title we all hate, and it being the most successful story I've written to date. I want to see if that will actually work. 

For fun, I want someone here to name it. 

The story is about a woman forcing a man to fight a bear, which turns out to be a metaphor for his experiences in therapy for his panic disorder.

No voting or structure. I'm just going to pick the one I like best. I'm taking my dog on a walk then rewriting the story and picking a title. Hoping to get it live around 11pm eastern (US). Lets see what happens!

**Edit**

[This](https://reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4uynur/im_a_bear_wrestler_and_this_was_my_worst_fight_yet/) is what I went with. It made the most sense to me. You guys had so many awesome ideas.

<TEXT> So I made this post! Also, I'm curious.

What kind of challenges do you give yourself as a writer?

Do you set out to write about a certain topic every once in a while? What about doing that exercise about writing about a mundane object and making it scary? 

Personally, I like to test myself and see if I can write one story a week inspired by some simple thing I saw. For example, about a week or so ago I saw a priest walking through an airport. Priest led to religion which led to mass which led to communion. Then, [this](https://reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/4tlegc/i_hate_being_a_cannibal/) was born. 

Or today, there was a shower thought on the frontpage. I liked it. I wrote an unique little piece about it. 

In the name of **MOOCGA**, I want to challenge you to write a scary story, paragraph, sentence (or whatever!) about the 9th post that's on /r/all at the time you read this. Be sure to link it up!

<TEXT> Shout out to /u/decomprosed

Harry and Ginny had a child before Albus Severus Bumblefuck Potter. 

After that last movie, Harry needed to break away from the showbiz lifestyle...but he didn't know how. Fucking all of those bitches with different wands was a *very* niche fetish, and Ginny wasn't down. She was a freak, but she wanted the dick, not a wand - she had her own. 

Since he couldn't get his rocks off anymore, Harry developed a drinking problem. Over the course of a day he would pound back a fifth of butter beer vodka and like three or four of those little packs of Bernie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. When he was tanked, Harry would get super horny and had to have Ginny right away every time. 

Well...wizards and witches don't have birth control. I mean, yea, there were basilisk-skin condoms but they killed the sensation, man. 

Ginny realized she was pregnant when she doubled over from a piercing pain I'm her abdomen. They went to the wizard doctor and he went all "x-ray spexray spellotronus" and confirmed Ginny's fears.

At home that night, Harry was livid. He wasn't ready to have a kid yet. Especially with all the wands he had left to use. After she went to bed, Harry snuck into their bedroom ever so sneakily and snuck onto their bed, sneaking under the covers and sneakily opening her legs. 

"Accio-fetus" he whispered sneakily.

A small *pop* was heard, as the fetus sneakily made its way out of Ginny and into Harry's hand. He snuck out of the room, sneaking down the stairs and to the trashcan. 

"Maybe next time" Harry whispered sneakily. </TEXT>

The pig grunted loudly as he masturbated faster and faster. All of the horses looked on in horror, too afraid to watch yet too curious to look away. Plus, they all wanted to win the bet. 

Squeals began filling the barn as he neared ejaculation. 

Other animals from the farm began peeking in the cracks of the wood. *What was going on in there?*

Suddenly, an eruption of white, sticky webbing spread all over the stables and barn floor. 

"Ta-Da!" Charlotte yelled, standing on top of the webbing that adorned her words. 

Everyone whistled in amazement. 

"You were right, Wilbur. You *can* do magic!" A horse said, congratulating him. 

"Thanks, I think the circus will be excited to have me!" Replied Wilbur. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was a normal workday, no different than any other. Woke up at 5am, quietly, so I wouldn't wake my wife and son up...which never worked. Every morning by the time I was done showering and brushing my teeth I would be greeted by a gorgeous woman and a smiling little four year old boy holding coffee and a bagel. It was rough working that early, but my family made sure I remembered how worth it it was. I walked to the train station - cutting through the park. Hopped on the train, and went to the airport. Not to travel, though - I ran a small shop inside of it. A mediocre job at best, but the added benefit of having a train station inside of the terminal made me hate the commute to work a bit less. Train in, train out, home.

I was closing the store that day, much to my dismay because (aside from the fourteen hour day) I wouldn't be leaving work until well after dark. Now, I may be a bit of an intimidating fellow standing at 6'3" and carrying 210 lbs. of muscle and frustration, but when you have to walk through dark alleys and wooded fields alone at night it humbles you. I've done it more than enough times - it's just something that you don't become acclimated to. 

After leaving the train station that night my first hurdle was a narrow alley bordered by fencing from start to finish. The implication that escape wasn't possible was daunting in its own right, but the lighting always hurt me worse. The entire alley was lit by one light post, circa 1940, that worked only slightly better than the US political system. When the light was out, you couldn't see anything outside of an arms reach. I got lucky that night, as the light was working just fine.

After crossing the alley, it was a straight shot through the dilapidated, city-funded park. Decorated like the Berlin Wall, it has a unique artistic vibe - beautiful, in an urban kind of way. Surrounded by woods, a lot of the...less-than-desirable types tend to gather there as it's harder to see what drugs and guns they have with them. 

I walked briskly, hoping to narrate my walk with brevity. 

"Through the grass, past the trees, to the street." I whispered to myself. It was my mantra - keeping me strong in an environment home to fear. 

**Pop**

My ears ached. It sounded like a firecracker exploded on my shoulder. 

**Pop**

I fell to the grass. I swore I saw myself standing next to my pain-infected body, laughing. Like a lucid dream gone wrong. 

I heard a familiar voice whisper:

"It's *my* turn." 

That's all I remember.



When I woke up, I heard my wife and two men discussing poking at my feet with a pen. 

"Ba..babe...where's our boy?" I asked, to an eruption of excitement and tears. I couldn't see yet, but I knew her crying voice.

"You're *awake*!" She hugged me, weeping into my chest. As much as I wanted to hug her back, I couldn't. 

"Where is he? Is he okay?" I asked.

"Honey, I...you're...they said-"

"Answer me, **dammit**." 

I tried thrashing up, but to no avail. I was tied down for some reason. What *happened*?

"Calm down, Steven. We can answer all of your questions in due time. Right now we need to administer a few tests and evaluate the present options." Interjected one of the male voices. 

"Sweetheart, you were attacked two nights ago. Someone found you lying in the park..." she sobbed heavily for a moment, "you had something lodged in your back -" she couldn't finish her statement. 

"Your spine was punctured at T6. I'm sorry, you've been paralyzed." Finished the male voice. Then a door opened, filling the room with instantaneous silence.

"Hi, Dad!" 



After a couple weeks in the hospital - and some extensive training with the motorized wheel chair - I was able to go home. 

My son was only four when I was attacked and he didn't quite understand the entirety of how life was now. I was always the dad who would take him on walks to the park. I taught him how to dribble a basketball...throw a ball...ride a bike. He viewed me like I was the one of the superheroes he was so fond of. 

It always made me smile when he would randomly come up me, give me a hug, and say: "Dad, I like you. You're the best dad."

He learned to love the wheelchair rides on my lap and loved helping his mom push me when we would go out for walks. Surprisingly, he seemed to be just as happy as ever for those first few years. At night, my wife would bring him to my bed and he would hold his book while I read it to him. We made it work. Although I couldn't physically help him with things, I made damn sure I was verbally supportive and that he knew how proud I was.

As time went on and he got older things became...trying. I was no longer the "cool dad" that could take him on rides. I became the dad who couldn't play catch. The dad who couldn't show him how to play guitar. The dad who couldn't play Mario Kart. He would never admit it, but he didn't need to. I felt the resentment and the distance starting to grow. I was losing my title of "Dad" in place of the my new name: "Burden." 

I loved my wife so much throughout everything. She stayed by my side for years, keeping our family together. As our son was growing up, she kept me mentally stable, insisting it was just puberty. I knew the truth - he didn't want me. 

Eventually, she had to hire an aide to come in daily and help her with the more physical tasks. I couldn't blame her, honestly. Our son wanted nothing to do with me. Anytime my wife asked him for help he would meltdown, reminding both of us - very audibly - that I wasn't a real dad to him and that I should "just die already." Tommy, however, was a great aide. 28. Good shape. Kind of resembled a younger me at times from what I could see. Tommy and I have never made eye contact...he always makes sure to keep his eyes diverted and his face partially obscured. But he definitely made the physical tasks my wife could no longer handle easier.

Bathroom. Bedroom. Stairs. Car. Orgasms. Tommy made sure she never had issues because of me. 

I wanted to be angry. I wanted to get up and cut off his fingers one-by-one for touching my wife...but what position was I in to place blame? Even on good days the best I could do was slightly squeeze my wife's hand. 

Besides, they had a strong bond like my wife and I used to have before the accident. She began laughing and smiling again. Her makeup came back and her hair fixed itself overnight. He swooned her using a lot of the same moves I used on her back in the day. We must have learned from the same people. I understood why we never exchanged eyes.

It was hard not to be jealous at times. But dammit, she still stayed. I'll love her forever for that.



A few nights ago, someone broke into the house. I was alone. My wife and Tommy went to get some groceries (their code for sex, we didn't eat *that* much) and left me to sleep on my inclined bed. Usually, this meant Tommy and my wife would go make love, then he would head to work and she would come home a bit later with things we didn't need.

I heard the small window on the back door shatter and the cracking of the hinges as it was opened. 

Brisk steps. The dual clacking of a heeled boot made its way through the house, straight to the front of the bedroom door. 

"Steven, it's time." A familiar voice stated. "This entire plan has been drawn out for years longer than it should have. Did you know you were supposed to die that night?"

I remained silent. Not out of fear, but perplexity. I *knew* that voice. It was familiar to me...but how? I wanted to place a face to the name but he remained outside of the door.

"You know, you were lucky to pass out that night in the park. It's the only thing that saved you. If you would have fully seen me, there's no doubt you would have died on the spot." He continued, lightly stroking the door with his fingernails.

"I'm going to give you a few days, Steven. Go ahead and get your affairs in order. Tell your wife how much of a slut you think she is. Tell your son how you hate him. Do what you want. Do what makes you feel good so you can die happy...I can fix your damage."

The man pushed the door open slightly, sticking his arm through the gap and giving the thumbs-up. 

"Same time next week?" 

With that, he left.



It's been five days now. 

I took the man's advice after some internal debate. He was right. Once I figured out who he was I realized it didn't matter what I did to them this past week - all would be forgotten. He really *could* fix the damage I created. 

I had my wife call my son first, since he was away at college. Unsurprisingly, he didn't want to talk to me. Ever since he left the house he's been a memory.

I looked my wife in the eyes before she left my room last night and called her a whore. There was no need for elegance or explanation. No conversation. We both knew the "what" and the "why."

Tommy, I like him. He's a good guy just trying to get by in life. I don't blame him for anything he's done and I feel he deserves a bit of thanks for typing this for me, and for being my confidant. Tommy here is the only one who knows the identity of the man and his ultimate plan.

They're going to call it a miracle, you know. Probably credit the experimental drugs I've been taking for a few months now. How else can you explain a quadriplegic gaining full mobility again? Unfortunately, the truth is less spectacular. 

The man who came to me almost a week ago. The one who tried to kill me in the past. Who's responsible for years and years of mental torment...is *me*.

Well, sort of. He's been wearing a disguise this entire time. Hiding. Waiting. [I](https://m.facebook.com/knutsonwrites/) knew Tommy had a trick up his sleeve...he's me - my doppelganger. 

In two days I'll be gone, and it will be his turn. </TEXT>

**Nevermind, I got to a point that I was very happy with and decided to post the story. I'll still take opinions and critiques, however!**



Hey guys, Mikey here. I'd humbly like to ask you guys for some opinions on this story...again. I feel that it may have some scary aspects, but not in the traditional nosleep style. I wanted to go with more of a realistic horror based on one of my greatest fears. Let me know what you think, please and thank you!

First draft. I'm leaving out a lot of detailing to keep my point concise.

----

It was a normal workday, no different than any other. Woke up at 5am, walked to the train station - cutting through the park, hopped on, and went to the airport. Not to travel, though - I run a small shop inside of it. A fun job, with the added benefit of having a train station inside of the terminal making my commute to work awesomely easy. Train in, train out. 

I was closing the store that day, much to my dismay because I wouldn't be leaving work until well after dark. Now, I may be a bit of an intimidating fellow standing at 6'3" and carrying 210 lbs. of muscle and frustration, but when you have to walk through dark alleys and wooded fields alone at night it humbles you. I've done it more than enough times too - it's just something that you don't become acclimated to.

<TEXT> My girlfriend just bought her first house and we're currently in the process is fixing it all up and making the adjustments she wants. Right now, we're on the bathroom. I don't have pictures at the moment, but all of the walls are half ceramic tile, half painted plasterboard. 

What she wants to do is just remove the tile portions, and replace it with drywall/plasterboard to match it to the remaining walls. Is there any legitimate concern with doing this aside from aesthetics? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It started with the gunshots. Seven clear *bangs* cracking the air. Some looked confused, unsure of what to do. They probably never experienced anything like this before. Others were afraid. Fathers ran for their children while they cried out in fear.

The sirens came next. It sounded like an entire fleet was coming to the rescue, armed to the hairline in tactical gear...hopefully. The response time was surprisingly fast for a *random* shooting. 

Finally, the screaming. 

**"My baby! You shot my baby!"**

Everyone looked around. Despite the circumstances, despite their differences, everyone was willing to be a hero that day.

Then it came again.

**"My baby! You shot my baby!"**

In the same tone. No one could see a person downed, covered in blood...nor a woman weeping over her child. 

**"My baby! You shot my baby!"**

That's when I realized the screams were coming from the trees by the jungle gym. I ran to the first tree and gave it the strongest shaking I could muster...and all the crows went flying out.

"These birds have seen some things." I muttered. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The body was torn apart. Small fragments of its former self that were much easier to consume. It was a slight inconvenience but the concern of a choking hazard was greater than the preference of a few other cannibals. Traditionally, however, the body would be consumed in small, whole pieces - no bones. 

Every last drop of blood was also drained from the body to be used as a liquid sustenance. The ones in charge told us that this was needed to become one with "Him." I never agreed with it. The idea of eating body parts and drinking blood disgusted me every time. 

It was a Wednesday. As we began to line up for our meal, the doubt in this practice overtook me. When it was my turn I spit in the face of the old man, and walked away. Before I opened the doors to the freedom awaiting me I audibly informed the group that they were "filthy cannibals."

I haven't been to church since. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was the start of lunch and Norman had finally decided to try the Mexican restaurant around the corner from his office. Norman was unusually excited for he had put off trying it for seven months, in favor of his turkey sandwich and crackers. 

He ordered a set of three tacos with just beef, light lettuce, and light cheese. Instead, Norman received three tacos with beef, lettuce, light cheese, and raw onion. Feeling adventurous, Norman ate one - saving one for Norman and one for a snack later. 

A couple hours after returning to work, Norman felt a small pressure build up in his stomach...the onions. Onions never sat well with Norman, and now he needed to use the facilities. Upset, Norman returned to the Mexican restaurant and asked to speak in private with the cook. Palms sweating, unsure of what to say, Norman took the cook into the back of the restaurant and smashed his head into the side of the building. 

"Please don't put onions on my food. They never sit well in my stomach." Said Norman as he walked away, eager to tell Norman about how he stuck up for himself. 


"Maybe I'll stick with the turkey a little longer." He said, as he walked back to his office. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey there!

You might be wondering what to expect here, or why this subreddit exists. To put it simply, I love the stories at /r/lifeofnorman but in that sub they're limited to keeping things fairly "PG." 

Personally, everything about Norman makes me think that he would have some insanely sinister secrets to hide in his unremarkable life. Also, this serves as a writing test in a way. To come up with a scary/dark story under 500 words and written in one specific style is definitely a challenge - one I intend to meet multiple times a week.

That's it. Have fun and enjoy!

<TEXT> The phone call came slightly after 11p.m.

"Mikey, the gate to your store is open. We have a cop watching it now but you'll need to come in to secure the store and close it."

*Fuck.*

My little Hyundai was in disrepair, causing me to have to take the train to work. Luckily, the stop wasn't too far from my house and I could get there in about five minutes if I walked through the park. 

Phone? *Check.*

Headphones? *Check.*

Wallet? *Check.*

Keys? *Check.*

Off I went, fixing one of my employees mistakes again. The streets were quiet less the sounds of two cats either fighting or fucking...or both. It's funny how much humans and animals are alike. 

There was an older man, no more than six foot, sitting on the slide at the park. His features were masked by darkness except for the small ray of light illuminating his tired, emaciated mug. He was transfixed on one spot. Watching. Waiting. *Protecting.*

As I passed through the park, a child - no older than twelve - ran up to the playground overjoyed when he should have been exhausted. 

"This **my** gym you asshole!" The man belted out as he charged towards the kid, stopping seconds before he went out of range. The child ran away in tears, yelling for his grandma. The man stumbled back to the slide, ready to defend again, in the name of valor. </TEXT>

"Norman, do you remember where I put the paper towels?" asked Norman.

Norman sat on the cushion of the kitchen chair, watching Norman as he began to sweat lightly. 

"Of course you don't." said Norman, chuckling to himself for expecting a response from a cat. 

Norman always bought his paper towels in bulk because it saved him $0.19 per roll. Sadly, Norman hadn't made it to the store yesterday since he was waiting to let the gas man inside to read the meters. The gas man never came, which made Norman unusually peeved - Norman missed the last day of the sale on cat food, and his coupon for paper towels expired. 

The gas man came to Norman's house a few hours ago. Norman welcomed him inside with a smile and an offer of cold tap water with three cubes of ice. As the gas man was enjoying his beverage, Norman stabbed him with an ice pick five times - one for each hour he had to wait. Blood spilled all over the white tiles of the kitchen floor...and Norman didn't have enough paper towels. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My house was freezing. I accidentally turned the air conditioning on too low before leaving that day, worried my dog would overheat. There was no way I was getting comfortable without my blanket. 

Curled up on the sofa under my smooth, warm blanket I turned on the news - I wanted to catch up after a long day of work. My dog jumped up to cuddle, but I had to put her down because she always chews on the blanket. I've had to sew so many new parts onto it because of that damn dog. 

*"A breaking story out of Cleveland Heights this evening. Another man was found dead inside of an abandoned home. Twenty-eight year old Jason..."*

I clicked off the news. All they talked about these days was the "serial killer" running around on the east side of town. I get it, I guess. The killer always skins their torsos and dumps the bodies in old crack houses - it's an interesting story!

But they keep assuming different motives for the killings: drugs, gang violence, etc. Honestly, I just need new parts to fix my blanket when the dog ruins it. </TEXT>

As she was counting out the money I couldn't help but feel like everyone was staring in my direction. They all had these judgemental eyes, insinuating I was doing something wrong. I didn't have a choice! I needed this money right then and there. All of them could leave soon and buy their groceries and go home to families. I couldn't. This was it for me. 

"$12,408, sir. All in small bills, like you asked." 

I begrudgingly grabbed the money then stood there for a moment while the man behind me sifted through the bag.

<TEXT> "Michael, I'm going to pull back the curtain and when I do, I want you to look out of the window, down to the pavement." She informed me, sternly. We had a good relationship, even though it was apparent she was starting to become annoyed by my cowardice. "You need to stick your head outside and look down. That's all you have to do. I'll be holding onto you so you won't have to worry about falling." 

I understood. She wasted no time grabbing the drawstrings and tugging the curtain to the side. This was it. The window was five feet away. All I had to do was stick my head out and look down. That's all. My chest puffed out a few times, I took my first steps and stopped. I could have sworn the sprinklers went off in the building because of the heat, but I was the only one getting soaked. I took a few more steps, almost getting knocked over by a sudden series of shakes in the ground, making my knees wobble. 

I made it to the window. 

"Look out, Mikey," she said with an affectionate smile while placing her hand on the middle of my shoulder blades.

"Are you sure it's not raining in here?" I jokingly responded. I had water dripping down from my jawline, onto to the windowsill. Knowing I couldn't turn back, I stuck my head out of the window.

**"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!"**I shouted, forcefully retreating into the office. **"ARE YOU A PSYCHOPATH?"**

"Michael," she sighed, "that is the Bear. We've talked about this so many times." She rubbed the bridge of her nose. I knew she wanted to be done with me, but I just couldn't do it.

"You have three options. One, you can fight back and kill the Bear. Two, you can let the Bear come in and kill you. Three, you can run as far away as possible and try to hide from it. What are you going to do?"

"Fuck, man." Slid out of my mouth, as did some spit. My insides ached. Everything in my body was shutting down, preparing to just lay there and die.

"Fight. Or. Die." She was cold now. "The Bear is here. You need to decide."

**"JUST MAKE IT STOP!"** 

My head collapsed into my hands. I was wheezing - unable to get the air out anymore. I knew I was helpless. This was it for me. The Bear was going to beat me this time.

She sighed, "Okay, we're done here for today. Next week, same time. For now, here's the refill for the Xanax. One milligram - we aren't going up any higher." </TEXT>

<TITLE> How I Quit Smoking </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-02 17:34:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Quitting, for me, wasn't about health benefits - quitting was solely about the money. Working at minimum wage wasn't enough to support my habits. I had bills to pay, a dog to feed...a life to live. 

None of the methods I found online worked. Meditation helped a bit, but before long I would get frustrated, persuading me to light up. Oddly enough, my job was the one place that had a helpful solution - a 24/7 quit hotline. 

The hotline was beyond fantastic. Greg, my personal "Quit Coach," was the only person who didn't give up on me. He even offered me my saving grace - sucking on hard candy. When I had the urge to smoke I would pop in a Jolly Rancher and the urge would disappear! A+ job, Greg. 

Until one day, at work.

My company was receiving double the amount of freight, and the stress was unforgiving. I had Jolly Rancher after Jolly Rancher. This was my test. Was I really going to quit?

In the middle of unloading, I ran out. I reached into my pocket and...nothing. That realization was enough to break me on its own, but I was determined to hold strong. Just an hour. An hour until we finished and I could go buy a bag. One hour. I felt my blood pressure spiking. I was tense. I began slamming boxes. My clenched jaw grinding my teeth. Brow crushed by gravity. 

*Cruunnncchhhh*

I almost fell to the ground from the pain, but I couldn't give in. I knew if I stopped that was it. A disgusting, metallic taste engulfed my mouth and I felt the sharp edges rolling around my mouth. I broke a tooth. My mind wasn't going to break, though. I could have been stabbed and I would have kept working just to avoid smoking. I kept my mouth shut and the broken tooth inside...kind of like...hard candy. 

I rolled the tooth around my mouth a bit, sucking on it - and my irritation...subsided. I became less tense. Less stressed. It was...therapeutic. 

I can't exactly say when the transition occurred. All the years of smoking left me with weak teeth, making it easy to break pieces off. Plus, on top of saving money on meth, I didn't have to buy Jolly Ranchers either!

I hid my new technique from Greg for a couple of months. I told him one day, though, when I ran out of teeth. He held his composer like a true professional. He told me he was sending someone to my house to help me. I love that man. 

Ms. Angela Craymoor came to my apartment to talk in a "comfortable setting." Part of her methodology, I guess. The problem is, you can't trust an addict to make rational decisions. I knocked her out. One by one, I extracted her aging, slightly yellow teeth and put them in a [jar](http://i.imgur.com/2FC1Tba.jpg). I called a friend, who took her away. Deed done, hands clean...well, slightly bloody. 

I haven't smoked in years. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I had only been doing it for three years, but addiction builds up incredibly fast. After roughly eight months I was going through a full bag every two days! Now, I preferred the elegance of using a pipe, which uses a bit less than other methods, but if you've ever smoked, you know that's an absolutely insane amount of product to go through that fast. My wallet, that darling, loyal friend of mine, shot itself and left a big hole where all of my money would keep pouring out. It couldn't handle the stress my newfound hobby caused. 

Quitting, for me, wasn't about health benefits - quitting was solely about the money. Working a job that paid me four dollars over minimum wage still wasn't enough to support my habits. I had bills to pay, a dog to feed...a life to live. Smoking needed to stop holding me back.

None of the methods I found online worked. Keeping my hands busy? No. Gum? Nope. Cold turkey? Ha! Nada. Meditation helped a bit, but it would never be long before I would start shaking and become angry, persuading me to light one up. My job, oddly enough, was the one place that had a helpful solution - a 24/7 quit hotline. 

The hotline was beyond fantastic for me. Greg, my personal "Quit Coach," was the most inspiring person I've ever met and, as much as I hate to admit it, was the only person who didn't give up on me. He was always available when I needed him - even those late nights when I couldn't sleep and wanted to give in. 

After a couple failed attempts with other techniques, Greg offered me my saving grace - sucking on hard candy. At first I was a bit skeptical. Let's be honest here, if none of the "official" methods worked, why would that? Well, I was proven wrong rather quickly. Every time I had the urge to smoke I would pop in a Jolly Rancher and the urge would disappear! A+ job, Greg. 

This worked out great for me until one particularly bad day at work.

My company was receiving double the amount of freight that day because of an upcoming holiday, and I was the one in charge of the unloading process. The pressure was rapidly building up inside of me, almost to the point where I couldn't see clearly. Jolly Rancher after Jolly Rancher after Jolly Rancher. This was my test. Was I really going to quit or was I going back to the first square? 

Then I ran out. Right there, in the middle of unloading the truck. I went to reach in my pocket and there was just a box cutter. That realization could have been enough to break me on its own, but I was determined to hold strong - I couldn't let Greg down. Just an hour. Just an hour until the truck would be unloaded and I could go buy a new bag. One hour. I felt my blood pressure spiking. I was tense. I began grabbing boxes harder and slamming them. My teeth were grinding inside of my clenched jaw. My brow getting crushed by gravity. 

Cruunnncchhhh

I almost fell to the ground from the burst of pain in my head, but I had to keep working. I couldn't give in. I wouldn't quit quitting. I knew if I stopped that was it. A disgusting, almost metallic taste engulfed my mouth - blood. Right after that set in I felt the sharp edges rolling around in my mouth. I broke a tooth. My mind wasn't going to break, though. I could have been stabbed and I probably would have kept working just to avoid the opportunity to smoke. So I just kept my mouth shut and the broken tooth inside of it...kind of like...hard candy. 

I began rolling the tooth around my mouth a bit, occasionally sucking on it. What else was I supposed to do? I couldn't swallow the damn thing! Not even ten minutes of doing this and my irritation started to subside. I became less tense. Less stressed. Furthering myself from the inevitable aneurysm. It was...therapeutic. 

I can't exactly say when the transition occurred. All the years of smoking left me with weak teeth, making it easy to grind them together and break a piece off. Plus, on top of saving the money on meth, I didn't have to waste anymore on Jolly Ranchers either!

I hid my new technique from Greg for a couple of months. Can you blame me? Slowly losing your teeth sucks away your sense of confidence. I told him one day, though, because I...well...I ran out of teeth. I didn't know what else to do. Greg, that saint, he held his composer like a true professional. He told me he was sending someone to my house to meet with me and get me the help I needed. I love that man.

<TEXT> I've always been a family-first type of guy, providing for others and ensuring they were taken care of before myself. Not just my family, though. I take care of my friends and other people who have been good to me - like Alex. 

Alex was the first person I met here who was genuinely nice to me. He explained how everything worked and even took time to show me around and introduce me to the higher-ups. Alex was a real class-act. In return, I made sure he got that vacation he requested...and a little raise (the kid needed it). Alex and I, we had a good friendship and if the circumstances were different I would have considered him family.

Until last week.

I had one last request: a box of Malley's Chocolates, from Cleveland. That's it. Alex was in charge of fulfilling my request, which was easy given its only about two hours from here in Clairsville. Piece of cake, right?

Let me tell you about what this fuckin' kid did.

Alex shows up about twenty minutes late - well past the end of dinner - with the slightly damaged box of chocolates. One request, and he couldn't even keep the box from getting ripped open. Lucky for him, I had no choice but to let it go. So I open up this box of chocolates and what do I see? One missing. That son-of-bitch. Still, I was at the point of no return...I bit my tongue for the first time in my life.

Now, I may be old but I'll tell ya I'm as sharp as ever. I decided to have Alex eat some of the chocolates with me. After all, the kid and I have been so close for all these years - it was only appropriate we enjoyed a final dessert together. At first Alex declined but I quickly reminded him it was either dessert with me now, or dessert with Ricky later. He knew his odds. Alex had a couple of pieces, but I decided to pass. Lost my appetite after all that prior bullshit.

Later that night, Alex came and got me and we took our long-awaited walk. It was unfortunately silent. I was hoping to impart some wisdom on the kid but he didn't seem to want to talk now. We got down to the room and I laid down on the table without any fight or resistance. I knew my odds. But before they could get me strapped down, Alex collapsed. 

We had to postpone. He was the only person there licensed to perform lethal injections. Something about poisoning or some shit. Beats the hell outta me!

It works out though. The feds are investigating everything surrounding Alex's death...including me, and that's buying me at least another few months. Maybe the next guard will be smarter about getting me my damn chocolates. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I Collect Mugs </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Connoisseur. 

Why, yes. I would say that the term fits me quite well, wouldn't you say so? Ha! Forgive me. You wouldn't know of my collection yet. I haven't told you!

You see, I collect something that your average layperson wouldn't understand. The general population doesn't share in the refined tastes that some of us fellows living in the penthouses of Manhattan do (let's not discuss the erratic tendencies of those "Bay Area" disappointments, hmm?). I collect mugs. I collect mugs from all over these great States of a multitude of shapes, sizes, and designs. At the time of this writing I would say my collection consists of approximately seventeen aboriginal pieces. Yes, seventeen now that I dwell on it. It would be eighteen, however one of the earlier pieces in my collection was unknowingly knocked off the mantle by Greta, my maid, and destroyed by that damn hound. Greta, being the sweet, sweet woman that she was, willingly donated her own mug to replace the one she had let be defiled.

Ahh, Greta. A saint if there ever was one, truly.

I fondly recall the very first mug I received. She was a big, black beauty that caught my eyes in the city of Grand Rapids, Michigan  (lovely city, should you ever desire to travel). I first saw her at Founders Brewery on the second to last day of my travels there. Carved by the hands of Aphrodite, she was darker than the night, with the smoothest complexion a man could hope for. This mug had to be no more than twenty-one, and even with that had aged like a bottle of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti. 

I had offered a price for her that was more than her yearly salary, but she quite audibly declined my generosity, the bitch (apologies for the language). I hastily made my exit and I decided that, offer be damned, I was going to have her for the start of my collection. I phoned Steven, my concierge, and informed him of my intentions and the compensation he would receive for starting my collection - to which he joyously obliged. 

Not soon after the brewery shut down for the evening, Steven kidnapped her as she was waiting for the bus in a (fortunately) dimly-lit area. Steven, in his words: "shoved that stupid whore into the backseat and bled her like a fountain pen." Good ol' reliable Steven. Although I had to reprimand him on his language, I was more than exhilarated at his success. 

Steven brought the body to the temporary facility not soon after 3 a.m. and we went to work. 

Now, as a gentleman, I refuse to explore the details of what removing a person's face entails. What I will inform you of, however, is that the process of preserving the mugs is of utmost importance. If one little piece of flesh is left unconditioned the rot will begin to set in rather quickly and will overtake the rest of the mug like a mold. Luckily, Steven, Greta, and I perfected the process around the third or fourth piece in the collection. 

Sadly, I must beg your leave now. My business is taking me to Newark on a meeting of taxes. To say this is entirely a business trip, well...I will just say that the man I will be enjoying dinner with tonight could have had a lucrative career in modelling as opposed to his life as an accountant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thump. 

That's the noise, alright. I used to think it was sort of a squishy thud, but after throwing so many into the holes I've realized it's a very clear thump.

Thump. Thump. Thump.

Every. Time.

In my profession, you have to do all of the work yourself. Countless hours of manual labor aging your body a year at a time and the psychological stress almost makes it not worth it. But nothing can stop me.

First, you have to secure the body - a feat that is difficult in its own right, given the state of the world today. Once you have that you're immediately tasked with securing it in order to keep it in tact...a broken body is no good to the holes. Transportation is a bitch too, depending on the type of body. Some might need to be kept chilled in order to make it to their final destination, some need to be bound tightly down to a flat surface to avoid movement. You also have to deal with loading and unloading one-hundred plus pounds alone, which, to be honest, sucks.

At the destination you could say things become a bit easier. The body is unloaded and generally any materials keeping the body intact can be removed (wrappings, ropes, etc.). Occasionally, you have to trim some of the limbs off in order to save space (it tends to get cramped now with so many bodies in a small space), and that can get messy depending on their thickness, but it's usually not a hard job. 

The only pain here is the digging of the hole. I don't have the sophisticated tools that some of my peers do - I'm all about shovels. They leave less of a trace. The depth of the hole can vary wildly based on what the age of the body is. The young ones typically only need shallow holes and the older ones need larger, deeper holes. Common sense, really. 

The young ones, though. They really get to me. I can't help but get emotional every time I put one into its hole. Thoughts about how they got here, what happened to them before, their futures...it's just...a lot. I know that they're serving a greater purpose now. I get that. But I wish they were able to stay at home in their natural state where they belong. Instead, I go and take them away and bring them to my land - acres and acres of other holes, filled with trees - hoping I can make a difference. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I really love this story. I'm proud of it and it's gotten really good feedback from people I've shown it to (excluding reddit, but that's not important to me).

However, one continuous comment is about the ending being confusing. 

My initial idea was to reveal that the narrator was stalking his fiancee before they ever started dating. That changed into me wanting to make it more vague and leave it to reader interpretation. Somewhere between those two I muddied it up and now it's missed it's punch. 

What could I have done to make it more clear in either direction?

<TITLE> She Has to Know </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For four long, long years love has suffocated the air. Two people, brought together by fate and stuck together by pure, raw obsession. This isn't love - no - this is greater. The gods themselves worked in unison to flap the butterfly's wings at all of the right moments. This is perfection.

No details have been spared to plan the future here. "A wedding fit for royalty" has been the only analogy made that can be accepted and honestly, it's true - Royal Family be damned. This is going to be an event of legend that generations upon generations will share with their kin in an undying tale of true love and devotion. Hollywood producers will kill each other to get their hands on this script.

Which is why she has to know before it happens.

"Mike, you'll never let go of the one you let slip through your fingers," my Grandpa always told me. Gramps might have been a bit of an ass most of the time, but I would be boldly lying if I said he didn't nail how much I wouldn't be willing to let go.

For years before my fiancee and I began dating I had an...obsession. Her name was Mary, and she was mine.

Attempting to describe her would be an injustice. Mary is that feeling you get when you finally sit down after a long, hard day of working. She is the whiff of a smell that takes you back to your childhood. A morning stretch after a night of long overdue sleep in your own bed. Mary is perfection.

We met during our senior year of high school on a Tuesday (March 11th, to be exact). Roughly ten minutes before the end of my French class, the familiar yet deafening drone of the fire alarm began to yell. As us students were trained to do, we briskly skipped out of the classroom door into the hallway, heading towards our momentary reprieve from educational slavery - the outdoors. Only one thing stood in the way...Mary.

Some might say that handing out fliers for the next school play during a fire drill would be ill-advised, but Mary was a go-getter. As the stream of students flowed past her I couldn't help but stand there, frozen in awe.

"Hi! My name's Mary, I'm the president of the drama club. We're putting on a *super* exciting play about the struggles of students during finals. You should come! I'd love to see you there!"

"Hi...umm..yeah, absolutely. I'll go." I said as I took a flier.

She shot me a wink and we both went on our separate paths.

The remainder of that day was spent preparing to sit in a stiff wooden chair for two hours next to classmates who didn't care to be there and parents who would have no choice. Excitement would have been an interesting lie, but for the opportunity to see Mary again, I was willing to do anything.

"How do I dress?"

"Should I bring flowers?"

Showtime came and went quicker than the balding gentleman next to me fell asleep. Now, most guys would tell a tale of how they found her backstage after the performance and performed a grandiose gesture of romanticism to woo her off of her feet and into their arms. Me? I stood outside of the auditorium hoping to run into her when she was leaving for the night. It was a fairly nice night for waiting - cool air, a few clouds playing hide and seek with the new moon, crickets in the bushes - and I was determined to have my time with Mary.

Years began to pass.

"Do you think she'll even be coming out this way?" I asked, starting to question my plan. "I mean, this is really the only way to get anywhere from the school."

Mr. Cricket didn't seem to have any advice, and decided to bounce off for a more entertaining venture.

However, not long after my company departed, I heard a metal clanging that bribed my attention - the auditorium doors! The dormant volcano of excitement erupted. I leapt to my feet and created a twister from the speed I turned with. As my eyes caught up with the rest of my body I saw her...beauty incarnate...kissing Tyler from my choir class. My feet, they gained their own heartbeat.

I turned back immediately. The blinds on the windows needed to be pulled down to keep this betrayal out of sight. My soul ached. My heart found a new home. My stomach ate itself in desperation. Still, I stood there like a fleshy statue of the anguish I had become consumed by.

"Hey! You're the kid from the fire drill, right?"

She noticed me.

"Hey, thanks for coming! It really means a lot to us that our fellow students support us. Are you...waiting on someone?"

I turned to her. She was alone now, and glowing with excitement. Tyler must have walked off.

"Ohh, me? Yeah, I'm just waiting on my friend to come out."

"Well, be careful. You never know who's lurking out here at night. I was walking home one day and I *swear* someone was following me. Anyways. I'll see ya around!"

On that note she began walking away, heading down the street past the cemetery. Something clicked in that moment, though. The adrenal glands began pumping harder than ever. I knew I had to let her know how I felt, boyfriend be damned. It was now or never and my body was practically forcing me away from that bear waiting to eat me.

I started walking to catch up with her, keeping my distance to allow my brain to formulate exactly what I would say.

Left on Pearl. Straight for a few moments. Left on Gifford. She was closer to the school than I thought. Seven houses down she walked up a driveway and into a modest blue house. My damn brain had taken too long to organize itself! All the while, without realizing it, my gait had slowed to nothing more than a geriatric patient's.

**Damn.**

The next couple of days were a blur. School. Home. Mary. Food. Mary. Sleep. School. Mary. Home. Food. Mary. Mary. *Mary.*

She was the only thing I knew now. My obsession. I *had* to have her.

Well, with motivation, anything is possible.

It wasn't meant to become a regular routine. The idea was that she would notice me often and eventually begin striking up conversations because of the coincidences.

"Oh hey, how crazy! I just saw you at the grocery store yesterday! How did that lasagna turn out? I bet your mom loved it."

"Where ya off to? The bus is such a great way to get around Cleveland. Great for the environment, too."

"No way! You like Pixar movies too?! My favorite is Monsters Inc., what about yours?"

Every scene was scripted perfectly, ready to play out at any given moment. All I had to do was be in the right spots at the right times and cross her path. There's no way she wouldn't notice me then! How could Mary ignore someone she ran into on a regular basis? That would just be rude.

My plans worked out perfectly...until she moved away for college - a day I'll never forget. I remember watching her holding back tears as she packed up her posters. It was hard for her. She was saying goodbye to her adolescence. To her parents. To everything she has known for 18 years. For her it was going to be worth it, however. Kent State University had an absolutely fantastic program for Graphic Design - her passion. Kent State also had a great program for Human Resources, and they were willing to offer me a great scholarship paying 3/4 of my tuition every year for four years. It was perfect.

Once our freshman year started, days turned into years rather quickly as I was always busy with school and extracurricular activities.

While in college, I discovered I had a talent for photography and you could always find me between classes with my camera - bus stops, trees, cars, park benches - anywhere and everywhere. I would spend all of my spare time trying to capture things in their most natural state of being, completely unaware a photograph was even being taken. There was a certain elegance in voyeurism that you can't replicate. Mary agreed, but I swear she knew I was there sometimes because she would try to model for me. Why else would she undress so close to a window? 

One day after a particularly long night of photo shoots, I retired to the campus Starbucks to refuel and edit some photos. That's when it happened.

"I know you, you're that Mike guy, right? From high school?"

There she was, standing at the front of my table with a heavenly smile and a glowing aura of love. Seeing her side-by-side with a photo really helped me realize how ridiculously stunning she is when not behind a camera lense.

"Can I sit with you?"

---

As cliche as it may be, the rest is history. We became inseparable. There would never be a pair of human beings who shared the same mutual obsession with each other again. We were truly a once-in-a-lifetime couple. The definition of a perfect relationship. Divinity.

Gramps was right. I never let Mary go.

Every single day I wake up and I'm instantly reminded of how much I love her. Throughout my day I frequently catch myself reading old texts from her I saved in my phone. I can't go on Facebook without going directly to her profile and seeing what she's been up to. On my drives home from work I always plan out dinner based on our favorite meals. I go to sleep inhaling her favorite scented lotion that she puts on before bed.

I can't get married like this. My fiancee has to know everything. She's so willing to make a lifelong commitment to me and I've been hiding this secret from her for years. It's time.

There's about twenty-five hours or so until our ceremony. Twenty-five hours to formulate my speech and resolve any issues it may cause between us. Telling her will be the hardest thing I'll ever have to do, but [I](https://m.facebook.com/knutsonwrites/) can't hide it anymore. It isn't fair to her. Mary gets her makeup done at 11 a.m. and her dress on at 1 p.m.. She would never forgive me if I made her walk down the aisle in any less than perfect condition. I just hope she understands how much I've loved her. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I came to and my head was pounding. It was one hell of a drop and, to be honest, I'm surprised my body survived it. But where was I? 

I had never seen a palace like this before! The walls were a beautiful, slate gray and ran up to shake hands with the sun. There was a small stream that ran between the walls all the way to a stunning outdoors made up of trees, rocks, and the most amazing shrubbery I had ever seen! This was a foot-for-foot scene from the Lion King.

I couldn't contain my excitement any longer, I just had to get out there!.. and that's when I saw him: a massive, black shadow standing just above my head. 

I have never been so afraid of a shadow before, my mom always taught me to be tough and adventurous. But as my soul was taking its last step from my body, the shadow and I locked eyes. He looked concerned, yet had a gentle warmness behind his worries.

The shadow picked me up and explained that he was the Guardian of the Palace, and his job was to protect all of its inhabitants at all costs. As he picked me up and got me to a comfortable seated position the Guardian explained that he didn't see me as a threat and would love to show me around the Palace grounds...my fear was momentarily overcome with excitement -- and that's when we heard them -- the Keepers...

I will never forget that noise. It was comparable to a man gurgling blood, trying desperately to absorb the air and mutter his last words.

"No time to explain, young one. We must leave this place and seek haven!" The Guardian roared as he grabbed me and ran down the stream to the outside. 

I thought we were safe. The Guardian thought we were safe. Things were going to be okay!

The Guardian and I locked gazes and I felt the warmth from him once again.

"Pht"

The air moved around my head.

"Pht pht"

The Guardian fell. I knew what happened instantly. The Keepers shot him, and they were going to come for me next. I sat there, unsure of what to do while waiting for my certain death. As the Keepers came closer, a blinding light cast a blanket over my eyes, and prevented me from seeing the Guardian's murderers.



I woke up in a hospital bed with my mother sitting next to me. I could tell she had been crying because her eyes practically swell shut at the first tear drop. She jumped as I said her name and attempted to turn me into a fruit puree. I joked and told her that of she keeps crying she might leave the hospital blind.

Her and the Ranger explained to me that the Guardian had to be killed in order to me keep me safe.

"HE WAS PROTECTING ME!"I bawled out. But before the tears had time to roll down my cheeks I felt a familiar warmth...

The Guardian! He was standing there too, right next to my mom!

"I'll always be here to protect you, young one." He whispered.

"Thanks, Harambe." I smiled.

He's never left my side.
