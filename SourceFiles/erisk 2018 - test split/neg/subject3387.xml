<TITLE> Japanese hiring style </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-16 20:05:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm wondering anybody have any information regarding the Japanese style of hiring? 

To give some details, I did the whole teaching thing for 2 years in Japan and returned to my country for postgraduate school. I am now trying to return to Tokyo and start working in a non English teaching position. In the past few weeks I've applied to about 20 positions and not a single one of them has even confirmed receipt of my application. Is this normal Japanese HR behaviour? 

Some of the jobs I found were posted on LinkedIn. Im using LinkedIn Premium on a free trial and can see that for these jobs, there are only a handful of applicants. So it's not like the recruitment staff are overwhelmed with applications!

Any info would be appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed. I was learning Japanese for several years before I started a year of formal study in university. Up until that point, I had never heard of transitive and intransitive verbs, even though I was using them correctly. Of course my Japanese friends being native speakers also had no idea what transitive and intransitive verbs were. 
I guess my point is that constant exposure leads to idiomatic use.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  is the present plain form of the verb. In the sentence , there is no indication of of whether it implies future or present and meaning is subjective to the reader.  does indeed make it present (continuous) however. 

Come to think of it, I would even be weary of saying "present plain form" as the ambiguity between present and future meaning exists.  </TEXT>

To add to this, I had three friends who did it one night. One became a kit kat wrapper, one a cabinet, and the other became the inside of a tyre. 

Most scarily of all, one of those friends took it again a week later, and in the brief period he was out of it, he said he experienced a whole week of his life. Totally mundane stuff, just getting up, doing chores, going to work, coming home, eating, meeting friends, etc. On the final day, he met that female presence who explained he'd be ok, and he kinda came to. After hearing that, I decided to put Salvia on my small but growing "nope" list.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To add, in high fat diets (i.e. cheese) the liver breaks down bacteria in the foods to form end products called lipopolysaccharides (LPS) which increase cholesterol in the coronary system and fatty deposits in the liver. However, some fungal or mold based cheeses have compounds which combat these bacteria before they reach the liver and form the dangerous LPS. Again, saving the French from heart disease.

<TEXT> Biological scientist here with an interest in diet and nutrition. Also my supervisor during my thesis was French and we talked at length about this paradox. Basically the paradox is that there is low incident of coronary disease despite the large a amounts of fatty dairy products consumed.

Yes the French eat more cheese than any other nation. But they also show portion control and eat a lot of fruit and vegetables. 

Also, as mentioned, the cheese is enjoyed as cheese rather than as a full pizza for example.  Research has also shown cheese to decrease inflammation in the body and also inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) which increases blood pressure. 

Then we have resveratrol - a compound found in red wine and grapes which acts as an antioxidant and exhibits cardioprotective qualities. It basically prevents the oxidation of LDL Cholesterol  (bad fat) which leads to heart disease. And as we know, the French love their red wine.

Just some food for thought. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys, blow in here, first time poster looking for some help as I've recently began learning French again.

I'm aware of using "have been" in French. E.g.
"a fait 5 ans que je parle franais." (I have been speaking French for 5 years.)

Using the above structure, if I'm referring to a past event, do I conjugate "a fait" or the present tense verb? 

E.g.
"I had been studying French for 5 years at that time".
" ce moment, a a fait 5 ans que je parle franais"?
Or
" ce moment, a fait 5 ans que j'ai parl franais."?

Apologies if both  my examples are incorrect and this is a basic question. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I also heard good things about Fukui and the JET community though I never went there.

 Ishikawa also seemed to have a very good community and is a good city.  Pretty big, good for nights out, restaurants, lively, young. 

For me, Kyushu is too far away from Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto,  and Kobe. Of course you have Fukuoka city in Kyushu but that's about it. There are a lot of great sight seeing spots in Kyushu and the local food is great, but like I said, a bit remote for me. Although my Kyushu JET friends loved it there. 

I was based in Yamaguchi and couldn't recommend it more.  It has a good active JET community and you're never too far from Fukuoka or Hiroshima.

If I had to choose however, I would choose Hyogo prefecture, with the hopes of getting Kobe. Huge JET community. It has beaches on one side and mountains on the other which is good for the outdoorsy types.  It also boasts a large international
 community. And you're never too far from Kyoto or Osaka if you want some tradition or party respectively.  </TEXT>

I really think it just goes with whatever is generally accepted in society. In sports or politics you hear "nippon" being used by supporters so maybe it has a stronger feel to the word.

<TEXT> I think you have it backwards. 
...... - "is it ok to take a picture"
...... - "is it ok to get you to take a picture" 

 is a causative verb form of "toru" (to take a picture or film). Causative verbs can be translated as "to make/to have somebody do something".

For example -  (seito ni eigo wo benkyou sasete mo ii desu ka) would be something like "is it OK if I make the students study english?" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Love this. The B52 style vocals are great and the lyrics are fantastic. I especially loved the "beyond a shadow of doubt" line. The dual vocals work really well and good use of panning. 
The acoustic, bass, and solo guitar play off each other nicely in the solo section. 

The backing vocals at 2:00 are perfect. Very subtle - good use of reverb. I would like to hear a touch more backing vocals to go along with the dual vocals at the end to spice things up further. Maybe just some "ahhhs" to bring climax to the song. 

Good song. The quality of the song pardons any issues in mixing and mastering I think. </TEXT>

I've been in Corl on and off for about 10 years now. It's a bit small and sometimes has a village-y feel and mentality to it but on the whole I'd recommend it.

<TEXT> Seems to me the bass is a bit flat sounding. Could be some build up of frequencies interfering with each other. 
Also the noise at :40 is a bit piercing. I'd bring it down in the EQ and maybe no showcase it so much in the song as it doesn't add too much value to the track.

Overall I like this track though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually have a degree in biological science and experience in pharmacology and neuropharmacology, and have close relations with some peers who work in policy. 

We are well aware of what is out there. I could go into the benefits of legalisation of all drugs, but I shall refrain as it wasn't asked. 

I will say however (and it is an odd reaction) that for some reason when people hear the word "legalise", they associate it with "available on every street corner". We are advocating legalisation with heavy regulation in attempt to support people with the disease of addiction, and to reduce crime. An example of what I mean would be heroin, still used in English hospitals, or perhaps even digitalis, commonly prescribed everywhere. These drugs are legal but heavily restricted. 

On the Krokodil point. If users had access to unadulterated products from clinics, taken in the supervision of medical professionals, with the goal of full recovery (such as heroin in Switzerland), drug use would in fact reduce, and Krokodil use would fade. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello all,

Just looking for some advice. I just got an unexpected payment of 3000 Euros. 
I have no debt or expenses to pay, but also no source of income as I'm currently travelling while between jobs. To add, I've no savings, no house or assets.
I'm a college graduate with two degrees and hope to start work in a few months when my travelling is done.

I'm not very experience in finance and am looking for the best option for this money. Save? Invest? Something else? Any advice would be most welcome.  Thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for your comment. I would tend to agree. Being a live take, the synth seems oversaturated and the vocals not as strong. That's the price you pay for doing it live I guess! </TEXT>

 It is not a subreddit which is trying to turn people away from science. I myself have a degree in science for example.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A similar experience happened to me while I had the one and only panic attack I've ever had in my life. It was an extreme attack with extreme manifestations of the classic symptoms - feeling I was dying, feeling I was going crazy, feeling reality isn't real, time misconceptions, tunnel vision, heart palpitations etc etc. 

Going back to the "feeling reality isn't real" (derealisation) symptom. For about an hour, a strange sensation was coming and going in waves where I felt flat. I felt 2d. Existence was like a side scrolling super mario game. This seems to fit in with the pages of the book concept. To add an extra spin, which I've no idea of the relevance, as well as feeling 2d, I felt infinitely stretched and long as if from my toe to crown was the length of the entire universe.

Furthermore with the time travel theory, time was insanely messed up during this attack. 1 minute felt like an hour. It goes to show that the passage of time is only experienced when there is a brain to do so, and altering the brain can alter the sensation of time.

This 2d sensation happened to me one other time previously from medication also. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I asked. He had no recollection of dreams where he visited me. Perhaps he was too young to remember if he did; or perhaps he simple did not have one. Although he did have a picture of him wearing a suit as a child. It was from a family portrait. And of course, it was the same black suit he was wearing while standing in my doorway at night.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Saw my living friend's ghost appear in my bedroom. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-29 19:27:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This happened many years ago when I was about 9 years of age but I remember every detail vividly, as it was so shocking. I'll try keep this story short.

It was a regular night, nothing out of the ordinary and I was sound asleep in my bed. I woke in the middle of the night, I'm guessing about 1 or 2 am, which I often did as a child, and sat up slightly. I looked over at my bedroom door, which was open, and saw my good friend standing there (friends since birth), holding hands with her younger brother. The two were looking at me, smiling, and seemed happy to be there, as if this late night visit was totally normal. My friend was wearing a period style dress and her brother a suit. At the time, I had never seen them in such clothing. To make it stranger, the two appeared totally white an translucent (like the classic "ghost" appearance). As a child, this scared the crap out of me, so I immediately jumped out of bed and made a run for my parents room. As I ran between my friend and her brother, I pushed them aside by the shoulders, and in doing so felt resistance, as if they were solid. 

Here's where it gets weirder. I kept this story to myself and passed it off as a dream; I didn't mention it to my friend until 7 years later when I was 16. The reason I mentioned it to her at this time is because she told me she had a really vivid dream where she visited me in her sleep when she was 9 (we're the same age. 1 week apart.). I asked "were you wearing an old dress, almost Victorian style, during this dream?". She said "yes, an old dress my aunt gave to me which she wore while making her first communion" (FYI: catholic ceremony). "I think I have a picture of me in the dress somewhere" she continued. My friend took a step-ladder, and reached into the back of a tall cupboard in her room, and pulled out a box of trinkets and memorabilia. In the box she took out a photograph from when she was younger, wearing her aunts old dress. To my shock, it was indeed the exact same dress she was wearing when she visited me that night. 

I certainly cannot explain what happened that night but I remember it as if it happened yesterday because it was so unusual. I only found this subreddit recently and thought I'd share the story and try get insight. Both my friend and her brother are alive and well to this day, and we still hang out. It's just something we accepted and guess happened because we're so close and were kids (I read that kids are more open and prone to this kind of thing).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like you mentioned in another comment, I was on the JET programme for a year. You leave Dublin with about 50 co-workers so you immediately have a close social network of Irish counterparts. 

Furthermore, when you get to your home prefecture, it's not long before you become introduced to the JETs who have arrived from other countries, and JETs who are already present in the prefecture. 

The programme pays very well also. 
That being said, I did leave it!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went to a decent club in Daegu, not far from you. There are two very people foreigner bars called "Thursday Party" where you can meet English speaking Koreans and foreigners very easily. It makes for a good place to warm up your night before hitting the late clubs.
Then of course there is Seoul with lots of places in Itaewon, Hongdae (younger university crowd), and Gangnam (yuppy type crowd) as popular spots. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in Japan myself for 3 years until recently and had plenty of Irish friends. There are about 1600 Irish on the islands at the moment mostly around the Tokyo or Kyoto/Kobe/Osaka area. For meeting people, I'd recommend the usual - hanging around bars and going to events. Japan has a thriving music scene and I found gigs, festivals, music events etc to be good places to meet Irish and other nationalities.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, but no, I am not wrong. Everthing I said is entirely correct. 

 I didn't say that serotonin and Psylocybin are non toxic. You are correct, as with all chemicals, they have a LD50 or "median lethal dose". </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is bad science. On the contrary, the wiring of the brain is not altered, and the active ingredients in the mushroom are quickly eliminated from the body. 

Psylocybin, found in mushrooms, is converted to the primary active chemical psylocin, which produces the profound effect. The only difference molecularly between our endogenous serotonin (a mood stabiliser amongst other things) and psylocin is the position of the 'OH' group on the benzene ring. What implications does this have?

In short, chemicals which are more similar to our bodies native chemicals are generally less toxic. The body can recognise, metabolise, and eliminate these chemicals easier. This is why mushrooms are perfectly safe and do not produce a hangover. It is also why alcohol (ethanol is not endogenous to our body) produces such negative effects and hangover. It also explains why DMT, the most powerful psychedelic known, is the least toxic and most fast acting - it exists in our body already in small amounts.

The personality changes due to mushrooms are caused by the mystical and profound experiences people encounter, and not by the drug itself.  </TEXT>
