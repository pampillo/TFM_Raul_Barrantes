<TEXT> Dude is all dress up and no substance. Check out Hannibal and American Gods. He likes to dress stuff up, but if you peek behind the curtain you'll see that there's nothing there. Really, can you tell me something interesting about the storytelling in Hannibal? I mean, yes, the score was incredible, the cinematography, the acting, even the dialogue seemed sophisticated. But as a whole, did Hannibal even tell a *good* story? Idk, there's just something about his work that doesn't seem ... genuine? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My favor is Stephen Kings IT gangbang, and other memorable mentions include certain sex scenes in ASOIAF, the Magicians, and Big Little Lies . although I gotta say, The First Law series have funny sex scenes, in that they're awkward and kind of real, what with the awkward grunting and the like. One that stands out happens in book 2 and it was hilarious. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First off, let me say that I *do not* do it on Ranked. Only casual. That said, teamkilling is one of those things that never gets old, even after 500 hours spent in the game. It's not like I always do it. But, let say that if I play 15 casual games in a day, in at least 5 of those I will mess with my teammates. I like having fun with it, like taking some health and acting like it wasn't me, or pretending to have bad aim during the prep phase while shooting drones. And don't think of me as a toxic player- i am not. In fact, i am a really good teammate when i feel like it. It's just that sometimes I like teamkilling.

<TEXT> Microsoft's strategy for Xbox has changed in a way which makes high-profile (and high-cost) exclusive software less justifiable within the company. That's especially true of high-profile games that won't be on Windows 10 as well as Xbox One; one of the ways in which the Xbox division has secured its future within Microsoft in the wake of the company's reorganisation under CEO Satya Nadella is by positioning itself as a key part of the Windows 10 ecosystem.curious as I am about howHalo Wars 2will turn out,Crackdown 3is another title that seems to have gotten lost on the way to release, as weve heard nearly nothing about it in ages. Im not sure who exactly is terribly excited aboutState of Decay 2, when another Microsoft exclusive zombie game,Dead Rising 4, barely made a splash in 2016. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally I still love it. That's exactly why this show is one of my favorites. They treat each plot line carefully, they flesh everything out as much as possible and they always go for a route that is both realistic and unpredictable. That's why this show has always had strong writing. Do I believe this season is perhaps a little slower than usual?  Yes. But I also really enjoy each episode and have faith that the writers know what they're doing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> She was screaming before the cock even slid inside mushy mush. Frantic sex ensued. 

"Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!" The midget girl squaled. 

"Jesus Christ shut the fuck up. And do you have to squeal like a pig?"

Off to one side, a clown was getting swarmed by exactly seventy monkeys, each one intent on pulling down his trousers and stick dicks or fingers through the hapless man's asshole. Tears ran down makeup ruined by tears. 

The giant reached down and grasped the midget's right leg. A savage heave sent the hapless creature flying into outer space. 

The moon, watching all this with haunted eyes, opened an incredibly large maw and sent vomit that was actually semen tumbling down to wash the earth below and these creatures that had no decency at all. 

A continent away, east, a king sat on his throne, getting a blowjob by his 27th son, but let us skip this horrid scene for now, and go further east, where a huge dragon was chained on a vast clearing. Every night, the villagers from the village close to the dragon set out in a procession to molest the poor creature and its exposed genitals. We should skip this too and go *further* east, inside a mountain carved into the likeness of a pair of breasts with a raging penis sticking out in the middle. The legend went that a god so obsessed with the naughty carved it himself. 

Inside the mountain, things were happening. 

Things that could change the world. Bring normality to the world outside. And who wanted normality in a world you didn't have to look long for getting your dick sucked? Or chopped off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've read a couple of times on the Internet about Erikson being compared to Shakespeare. As someone who's still on his 1st read, yes, I know there is tragedy, but almost every book of the main series I've read so far, while tragic, also has moments of light and (some, however slim) happiness. 

But tragedies almost always end...well, tragic. But Erikson juggles so many characters that the end of his books can have some sad stuff but also moments of hope. Thoughts? </TEXT>

<TEXT> His huge cock slid into her wet fucking pussy. She immediately started screaming. 

"FUUUCK. FUUUCK. FUCK ME
 FUCK ME FUCK ME FUCK ME FUCK ME FUCK ME FUCK ME EEE AWWWW...AAAAAAAAAAAAH!"

He went crazy with her tight little pussy. He started wheezing like a man-pig. "MMMMMRPHH," he groaned, pounding her like the good cum-whore that she was. 


                           

                        


              ***





Some time later, he reached into her gaping asshole and started rummaging inside.

She started screaming again. "Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!"


She squirted all over his fucking arm. 



        
                            

              
            
           
               ***







He slipped his cock out of her throat and unplugged her nose. 

"Shit..."

James checked her pulse. Nothing...it happened again. 

James stepped back, unperturbed, and pulled his iPhone out. He dialed and waited. 

"Hello? This is James. It happened again."

<TEXT> So I've heard in various interviews about how some rappers apparently had a falling out with Tupac before the time of his death. Among the rappers apparently Snoop Dog, Ice Cube, Dre, Suge Knight, Biggie, and some other were involved in some falling out ot another with Tupac. Now, what if, all these rappers conspired to have Tupac taken care of?

Maybe they saw him as a threat to their careers. Maybe they thought that as long as Tupac lived, there would be no other king of Rap. What do you guys think? ??? </TEXT>

Jesus Christ sucking a popsicle. Did I say I was superior? Did I say that? Are you assuming I'm some guy who thinks of himself as extremely intelligent? Fuck no. In fact, I'm pretty ignorant and my knowledge is probably below average at best.

My friend, however, is pretty dumb and even he admits it. Last week we spent looking for a pair of keys that were in his pockets all along. He even thought Obama was Puerto Rican for fucks sake. I'm just saying people like that will probably have a hard time understanding Malazan. That's all. No need to get Triggered.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ser? My lady? said Podrick. Is a broken man an outlaw?

More or less, Brienne answered.

Septon Meribald disagreed. More less than more. There are many sorts of outlaws, just as there are many sorts of birds. A sandpiper and a sea eagle both have wings, but they are not the same. The singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord, but most outlaws are more like this ravening Hound than they are the lightning lord. They are evil men, driven by greed, soured by malice, despising the gods and caring only for themselves. Broken men are more deserving of our pity, though they may be just as dangerous. Almost all are common-born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where they were born until the day some lord came round to take them off to war. Poorly shod and poorly clad, they march away beneath his banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or a sharpened hoe, or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with strips of hide. Brothers march with brothers, sons with fathers, friends with friends. Theyve heard the songs and stories, so they go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders they will see, of the wealth and glory they will win. War seems a fine adventure, the greatest most of them will ever know.

Then they get a taste of battle.

For some, that one taste is enough to break them. Others go on for years, until they lose count of all the battles they have fought in, but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break in his hundred-and-first. Brothers watch their brothers die, fathers lose their sons, friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after theyve been gutted by an axe.

They see the lord who led them there cut down, and some other lord shouts that they are his now. They take a wound, and when thats still half-healed they take another. There is never enough to eat, their shoes fall to pieces from the marching, their clothes are torn and rotting, and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water.

If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm, they need to take them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk whose lands theyre fighting in, men very like the men they used to be. They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens, and from there its just a short step to carrying off their daughters too. And one day they look around and realize all their friends and kin are gone, that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize. They dont know where they are or how to get back home and the lord theyre fighting for does not know their names, yet here he comes, shouting for them to form up, to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes, to stand their ground. And the knights come down on them, faceless men clad all in steel, and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the world

And the man breaks.

He turns and runs, or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain, or steals away in the black of night, and he finds someplace to hide. All thought of home is gone by then, and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day, or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few hours. The broken man lives from day to day, from meal to meal, more beast than man. Lady Brienne is not wrong. In times like these, the traveler must beware of broken men, and fear thembut he should pity them as well.

When Meribald was finished a profound silence fell upon their little band. Brienne could hear the wind rustling through a clump of pussywillows, and farther off the faint cry of a loon. She could hear Dog panting softly as he loped along beside the septon and his donkey, tongue lolling from his mouth. The quiet stretched and stretched, until finally she said, How old were you when they marched you off to war?

Why, no older than your boy, Meribald replied. Too young for such, in truth, but my brothers were all going, and I would not be left behind. Willam said I could be his squire, though Will was no knight, only a potboy armed with a kitchen knife hed stolen from the inn. He died upon the Stepstones, and never struck a blow. It was fever did for him, and for my brother Robin. Owen died from a mace that split his head apart, and his friend Jon Pox was hanged for rape.

The War of the Ninepenny Kings? asked Hyle Hunt.

So they called it, though I never saw a king, nor earned a penny. It was a war, though. That it was. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Round 1: the Arena where Oberyn fought. Daredevil (show) in his latest suit and the zombified version of The Mountain in full armour. The Mountain has his sword and Daredevil has all his gadgets that he's acquired as of s2. 

Round 2: the streets of Hells Kitchen. Daredevil is in his season 1 beggingers outfit (the one with the black mask) and the Mountain (normal version) is in civilians clothes. Both are unarmed. 

Round 3: Mat Murdock in lawyers clothes must survive in the Arena against two armed versions of The Mountain for 5 minutes (like IP man vs Myke Tyson). After 5 minutes, if Murdock is alive, he wins. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There once was this king who would call in a different Jester every night. Drunk with wine, he would nonchalantly look on the show that the hapless Jesters spent months in advance preparing. But Jesters feared entertaining this King, for once the show was over, he would clap his hands twice and a pair of guards would escort the Jesters away, never to be seen or heard from again. 

This particular Jester swore that he would put on the best show that any King has witnessed. A spectacle for the ages! He spent nearly two years preparing every part and detail of this great endeavor. Finally  the fated day arrived, and this Jester impressed the King (or tried to) with this great spectacle, and every noble at the end cheered and clapped their delight. But the King remained silent, watching the Jester with cold eyes and a hard frown.  Finally the King raised his hands, clapped once...then clapped again. 

The guards took the Jerster away. They did unspeakable things to him.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I don't know much about DD other than the 2003 movie and the show. That said, it's pretty clear that he won't kill in the show no matter what. Which brings up the question...what will he do once Wilson Fisk is out of prison? Surely he can't beat him up again and send him back, it's obvious that won't work. The only way for DD to deal with Kingpin this time would to either a) kill him or b) beat the fuck outta  him and send him far away, out of NYC, somehow

Thoughts? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't get me wrong, I love this series to death and I immensely enjoyed season 2...but the Hand storyline fell flat for me. Especifically when those ninjas who couldn't kill their way out of a plastic bag came on screen. UUURRRGHHH, watching Daredevil battle a bunch of ninjas was seriously very lame. And to me their storyline made no effin sense. What are their motivations thorough season 2.
To me it felt like they were just there to provide cool fight scenes that felt stale after a couple of times. 

Other than the Hand, s1 and s2 are excellent IMO. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah the people thinking the viewership will shrink or something are delusional. Chances are it will be the most watched episode of the whole damn show or at least it'll have a solid comeback in terms of views, and let's be real, after that we'll move on. People saying they quit the show on the internet will hurt AMC as much as a bird crashing into an elephant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only way they will come even close to redeem this unredeemable action in my eyes is if Season 7 is 10/10 with no filler, no bullshit episodes. We know the first episode is gonna be good, it always is, but I want them to treat every other fucking episode of that season like a fucking boon to us fans.

I want Season 7 to be insane and I want these two assholes to make it up to us. I know we still have a lot to cover up before All Out War, but these fucker better make it up to us in some way. Season 7 needs to be entirely something else.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Scott Gimple and Robert Kirkman should feel ashamed of themselves. The fans aren't the only people they disrespected. Every single actor included in that scene gave their 100% and brought the scene to life in a way I couldn't imagine. But, alas, all that's been looked over because these two clowns decided none of that mattered as long as they got their sweet, sweet views next October. 

Fuckers. </TEXT>

He recalls Rake's hunt for Cowl and the ensuing battle of sorcery.

My question is, weren't the Mott Irregulars fighting the Malazans? And weren't the Crimson Guard in alliance with Rake seeing as how they're with Caladan Brood? Why then did Rake fight this Cowl for? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also the fact that the series peaks at book 3 and then drops in quality for the next two books doesn't help. 

This is why I always recommend ASOIAF fans the Malazan series. You know that a series is damn good when almost every fan ranks all the books differently. For some book 2 is the best one, for others book 3 or book 5 or 7. It makes for a better reread, when the whole series is a steady incline in quality. </TEXT>

Morales and his family are probably chained up in some psycho's basement. He...visits them...everyday...*and takes something*....until they are nothing more than empty husks.

<TEXT> Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter. It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself. I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

And it's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (other side)
I must have called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter. It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[4x:]
(Highs, highs, highs, highs,
Lows, lows, lows, lows)
Anymore

Hello from the other side (other side)
I must have called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter. It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

<TEXT> He's a good writer but, alas, I firmly believe the books will NEVER be finished. I've thought about this long and hard. Theres just no way, none at all. 

And what a shame, eh? That one of the best works of fantasy ever written will not know a last page. 

George RR Martin should really pass the torch into the hands of someone who can write the words that are still left to be written and *do it right*.
