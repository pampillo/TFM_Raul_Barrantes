<TEXT> Ive Made a Mistake

The university that I call home was once a prison to many. The halls of housing and the lecture rooms are refurbished mental institution quarters and facilities. Even though most of the buildings have been dressed so well that youd never guess it. There are still entire buildings on campus that are locked and off limits. On a tour with a few police officers Id made friends with I saw the rooms that still wore padding and the beds where the mentally ill once laid. Many of the faculty would rather have you focus on its fresh start and academic resources and tend to put away the thoughts of mental patients being neglected and kept against their will for awful and unjust reasons. I however had been told the stories from my father that worked as a maintenance man on the premises when I was a child long before the university was anything more than abandoned garbage. Patients bashing their heads against the walls, homosexuals committed by their loved ones, easily treatable high functioning mentally disabled patients treated like maniacs, the graves for those who died without name, the list goes on and on.

So I did my digging and decided that I wanted to learn more, I am.. was was a horror fanatic and loved the creepy pastas that fill the internet. Thats when I learned about them, the shadows that still inhabit the same halls we do. The officers where quick to chuckle about the calls where a woman was heard screaming and seen in at the far end of a hallway in panic. Only to find that the cameras showed no one. Whispers and voices heard in rooms with limited access. Doors of abandoned buildings slamming from the inside only to find that there was no sign of trespassing. Just talk of silhouettes and figures without any real concrete descriptions. Plates moving on their own and chairs being placed facing corners, the list goes on and on.

This is where I come in, I fell in love with this school and its charm. The fresh new feeling of the facilities and the faculty. The boom in local education, but I cannot lie, I was madly in love with its history. I used to spray paint stencil graffiti when I was in high school and for a while after. A few friends had caught nasty fines and jail time and seeing as how I had managed to remain unscathed by the hobby I decided to call it quits and burn all stencils that were anywhere illegal and delete all of my memory cards. That is.. until I found the room. Adjacent to a small university gym there is a room where the walls are free to paint on. I hadnt seen anything like this since my days stumbling around old abandoned buildings inhabited by tweakers. I couldnt help myself, that very same day I eagerly cut a new stencil in the shape of a slack jawed cynical face. I wanted to paint a shadow man.. our unofficial mascot.

The thing we thought about as we walked to our dorm rooms alone from an event. The thing we thought about when we struggled to find a comfortable spot to sleep at night. Every noise that could not be explained right away was attributed to these night stalkers. So I wanted to make my own. I painted the shape of a huge stalky shadow with its head cocked to the left in black. And I in white I stenciled in my slackjawed Shadow Man face. I was proud of it because the window you had to pass in the hallway that looked into the art room showcased a shadowy horror figure standing in the corner staring at you. I had hoped that it would cost some of my classmates sleep. What did I care ? I had nothing to fear, I used to traverse abandoned buildings and sketchy hobo camps armed with nothing more than a few spray cans.

How was I to know that it would backfire this way ? How was I to know that some one would take offense ? How was I to know how much truth there was to the stories ? I was a skeptic, ok ? I see them everywhere now, the bushes whisper when I walk past as if someone was watching. I hear people in my hallway at all hours of the night. I look through my peep hole and could swear I see someone scurry away just as I look. But the buildings... the ones that are left abandoned... refurbished... some great lie meant to comfort those that know and mislead those that dont.

I cannot go near them anymore let alone go back inside. The wails of those lost call me, slamming, scraping, clawing at the walls I can hear them. Theyre upset at me for outing them. I cant even take it back, my first thought was that finals were getting to me and my imagination was running wild. So I got some sleep at a friends house and took a few of them to the art room without telling them to paint a few flowers stencils and goof off. I encouraged that we cover the ugly weird thing while I painted. I had to ignore their desire to paint anywhere else because of how much they liked the damned thing. I returned to my dorm and took a fresh razor to the stencil of the slack jawed shadow man. I slept like a baby and felt no fear as I shut my smart phone off for the night laying there in the darkness. The next day I walked by the art room after a nice workout only to find that my Shadow Man was back as if nothing had ever been painted on it at all. I own the only stencil of the shadow man! Me and only me! I thought I could stay out of the night and maybe if I got enough sleep they would leave me alone. I wish I could say going to sleep early helps. Accept now they dont wait for nightfall anymore, now they play with my food while Im cooking.

I have proof... I caught it on my cell phone. I never believed in anything paranormal, It was always entertainment for me. But the game is over... listed in the links below I will post a youtube video that has never been uploaded by anyone else other than me... with photos of a room you wont find anywhere else on the internet. This semester is almost over and I havent slept in my room for a few days. Ive found a new apartment off campus. Ill update with new information as it happens.

<TEXT> RIGHT ?! I was watching that richard spencard dude talk to a gaggle of his kkk budies at a holiday inn. And the conversation went from an already appalling conversation about concentration camps for black people, straight into jewish hate. And i'm sitting there thinking, wait a second, this man is clearly a maniac and his ideas are bullshit. But i expected it, you have a movement for black people rising in the US so naturally there is going to be some shit head that starts up an anti black people movement. But than BAM !! segways straight to jews, I don't get it. </TEXT>

I said something "what the fuck ? stupid cunt !" and I doubt she heard me at all because she was on him like a rabid house cat. Punching, kicking, clawing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A while back I received some high power 1,000 yard binoculars as a gift. I'm an avid hunter and target shooter so they were used often. In oregon it's not uncommon to live in an apartment complex that is 100 -200 yards away from the nearest neighboring apartment complex. Due to regulations you can't shoot a deer within city limits unless it's right on your property and i'd been eyeballing this same buck for over two weeks. It made it's way to a apartment complex +60 yards away to nibble on some flowers when I noticed that the woman who lived in the second floor of the apartment complex had her blinds open and was walking around butt naked. Older woman with short dark hair, maybe in her 40s. Pretty fit for her age, I was maybe 20 at the time so naturally I looked for longer than i should have. I still feel a little bad about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was walking back from a small mini market with some snacks and beer to enjoy with a few friends back at my apartment. We were almost home when this guy hanging out on his porch asks the million dollar question "Aye, where you from ?" Now I had already had a drink or two in me at the time. So i answered foolishly with something like "Just rode my moose here from alberta ese, looking for work but you guys don't hire mounties here," so the guy take his beer and smashes it across my face. I drop my groceries and knock him back onto his porch and hit him in the face till he stopped trying to fight back. He might have given me an ugly scar on my face and hand but i think I rearranged his dentistry.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Doug (Ben Affleck's character) is put up as a good guy by the movie. But he had no objections robbing banks and armored cars at gun point. He only really objected when his accomplices began to get sloppy. Not only does he hold his love interest at gun point, but he builds a relationship based on lies that eventually gets sexual. he's a bad guy that does illegal things, but the movie doesn't villainize him enough for it. </TEXT>

We had a larger target a little closer and we were getting decent accuracy. He calls me over while we were paling around, loading up a few mags. He asks me if one of us could give him a few quick pointers on how to fix his accuracy. He's waving the gun around with his finger on the trigger as we talk and I ask him to stop. He tells me that the gun is not loaded he ch - BAM !! He puts a hole right in the ceiling next to our heads. I tell him to put the gun down and get the range master to help.

I'm already paying $8 for a shot of jack when the bottle will cost $15. I shouldn't be catching you staring daggers at me for not slipping you another $2 - $5. And my sushi bill is already running me $50 every time i take the girlfriend out, why should it be $60 ?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally think it has a lot to do with the way we were raised by society. I mean, sure girls have to deal with the preassures of being pushed towards barbie, and baby dolls. But they gave us GI Joes, they gave us nerf guns, recruiters paid a lot more attention to the boys when they came to our schools. Playground fights seldomly involved the girls, and our cartoons often depicted men as warriors. Make a kid think he's a warrior and man grows up with nothing to fight, then boom.  </TEXT>

But if a civil conversation can be had I like to let them know that there is nothing wrong with me. My skin is brown and my relatives come from mexico. But I was born here and have the same rights that you do, I am not the problem. You on the other hand chose to have a mental defect, some one born with a mental defect can never chose to not have it. But you choose to be racist, you choose not to accept me. Though I am peaceful, despite my law abiding background, in spite of my community service and blood that i have given for my community you choose to discriminate against me. Even though at any moment you can choose not to, you are the problem. not me. </TEXT>

Trying to patch up relationships with people that realistically didn't care about me because they were well received by others. Than I lost some one very close to me and it really put into perspective what I should be focusing on and who I should really be spending time with. 

I had to break apart pretty bad before I formed who I am today.  I recommend doing it the easy way.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I bought this thing online some time ago called an Aztec Death Whistle. A resin/epoxy skull that you can blow into and it makes the sound of a lady demon screaming. My sister was home alone and I still have mail that arrives at my mom's place so I stopped by around 10am to pick up a few things. I had just received my whistle at the time and I wanted to freak my sister out so when I opened the door I began making the whistle chirp in shorts bursts. This got my sisters attention in one of the rooms and I was in a blind spot next to the kitchen out of her line of sight. Once I heard her exit her room to see what was going on I began to make the whistle scream. I heard her fall and scramble to get in her room, When I felt she had enough I went to see what she was doing and she had her arm cocked back with an xbox controller at hand. She had a look in her eye like she had accepted death at the hands at what ever she imagined was making the noise. SHe pitched the controller at me when she saw it was me and dunked a glass of water on my head hahahahaha


This is the exact thing that I bought.

<TEXT> I used to spend weekend shifts working for a medical growing operation doing security work for an outdoor field. I had some basic training from a security group but mostly I was just a clipper getting paid over time to make sure hikers, wildlife, and trespassers didn't mess with the out door plants. You really have to get over how far away you feel from everything, you reply scenes from horror movies a lot just to kind of spook your self without really having much control over why. 

I know it's not exactly solitude but I had an issue with my partner once. You see we were given hunting rifles to patrol the and with because of pain in the ass deer that loved to eat our crops and armed thieves that other guards had already had violent run ins with. I'd done my shifts alone for some time but they decided to give me a partner so that we could alternate walk throughs while both sides of the property still had eyes on them at all times.

I wont give his name, but I can describe him as very.. Columbine. He had a fascination with weapons and he was very awkward and didn't really know how to connect on a social level despite my best attempts to make small talk and befriend the person I was forced to spend almost 48 hour shifts with. Most days were uneventful except for the small game hunting here or there. But one day I had my eyes behind the spotter scope panning over the edge of the property maybe three hundred yards out while my soup came to a boil. When I saw a rustling of two hikers in out south east crops. I mentioned to my partner that we had activity and he sprung to my berm with his rifle at hand. He racked a round into the chamber and began scanning for them. I was in shock, his safety was off and he didn't even bother to ask if they were armed. I pointed his barrel down and and asked him what the fuck he was doing. "They're tresspassing man, they walked right by the signs, we're in our right. You don't know if they're strapped ! They could blow us away !," 

Our land neighbored an area that had a light hiker traffic and the occasional back packer. I yelled at him while trying to wrestle his barrel to the floor that they had back packs and hiker clothes and I couldn't see any weapons on either of them. After a few minutes of panicked debate I eventually got him to agree to come with me with his safety on and we'll handle the situation. It was only 200 yards but it felt like the longest walk of my life with columbine murdering behind me the whole way "We're in our right.. if we get smoked it's your fucking fault... fucking pussy going to get us killed.. we don't know how many more are out there..." I couldn't have him lead the way and risk him shooting some idiot hiker but I hated having him behind me with that gun. 

Once we were within thirty feet I whistled to grab the attention of the male hiker. He turned in my direction and what I assume to be his girlfriend froze like deer in the head lights. I let them know that they were trespassing and that they probably ignored a sign to be here, that if they took anything from the plants that were not ready to be harvested they already ruined what they took so they could keep what they already had. I let them know that if they made any sudden movements or took out any sort of weapon that the gentlemen behind me had no problem with putting them both down. The woman was trembling and couldn't speak though her mouth occasional moved as though she meant to. The man agreed and said they'd stay clear of the property.  </TEXT>

Tunnels are a thing that are already in place and if you're a southern californian or a texan you know that there are several bodies of water that cannot just be walled off. Plus your main issue isn't even the border, it used to be easy for people to come and go as they pleased and make a life in mexico and business in the US. But now that the borders are being locked down more and more people are just overstaying their work and school visas and that's where your numbers really come in. (Keep in mind that usually if you're here on a school or work visa than statistically speaking you're not a criminal of any caliber that Mr. Pumpkin Head has mentioned) </TEXT>

For a bit a ran into more awkward dates and one nighters but after some hiccups I think i found the girl I want to marry. It started off as a decision that I was just toying around with and now I'm in a committed relationship of almost four years, living together for three.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Would've posted more but I was running late before. My sister had a reoccurring incident that makes my hairs stand up recalling it. After we went through the trouble of dumping all of the water bottles and unpacking within the first week my sister brought something to my attention. She shared a wall with the garage and one night around 4am she made woke me up to something I still cannot right off now in my adult life. She shook me awake and took me to her room and asked me to be very quiet. In the mexican community it is very common for many to gather a week before a funeral after some one has died to take part in a catholic prayer. Among other prayers during a night of this tradition they say a Rosary worth of hail mary. And through the vent of my sisters room you could hear what sounded like several older woman chanting hail mary in unison in hushed tones. We did not share a building with anyone else, it was a three bedroom house. After a few minutes of listening and not being able to move I took my sister to my parents room and asked my mom and dad to come listen. When they knelt down to listen my sister said in an average speaking voice "Listen mom, they're in the garage" and I swear to this day my mom and dad heard a chorus of "Shhh.."  come from the vent. My dad was of course enraged and being that i was maybe 14 at the time it was up to us to brave the garage and see who was there. My dad flung open the garage door and found no one. Besides the large car port door there was only one door that led to the garage and no one was there. Like I said, I don't need validation from lying to you. i know it's what i saw, and that's enough for me. I have more if you'd like, to this day I call my self a skeptic because my parents validated my fears with their superstition and never got a clean cut answer as to what went on in that house.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can choose to believe me or not, I know what I heard, and no one can take away my truth from me. We did some moving around when i was in middle school, after a few places didn't work out we ended up in an average sized three bedroom in southern california. I had problems from day one, after spending all day helping my parents move in the last of our things i nestled into my room full of boxes and watched The Empire Strikes Back since there was no cable and I was having trouble sleeping. my tv was next to the open door and just as I began to doze off i saw a bottle tossed into the room at hip level from the pitch black hallway. I heard foot steps leading towards the living room which was opposite of the rest of the bedrooms. After calling out to my mother, father, and sister for a bit. I turned on the lights and found no one in the living room or kitchen. After waking up my parents who I assumed were being mean to me they told me that they'd been dead asleep, and neither of them can fake the snoring. my sister who was also dead asleep barely remembers being woken up that night. I showed my mom the bottle and she wrote it off as it being mine and falling from a box. The thing is, it was a gatorade bottle filled with water and it had what I call indito spanish scribbled on it.The day after next we began to put away the yard tools and make use of the shed. The backyard shed was full of all sorts of different bottles of all shapes and sizes filled to the brim with water and covered in scribbles. It looked like some one had lived there at some point. The stories keep coming right up until we moved, if you're interested in more let me know.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought the fucker was dead for a while but later found out he pulled through. Some time ago I went to confront the person responsible for selling a good friend and ex-girlfriend a lethal amount of dirty heroine. After our break up we stayed in touch but she went back to using, begged her to stop but I heard from others in our circle that she was still buying, it wasn't long after that it took her. I pulled up to a neighborhood where some friends were expecting me and saw him dealing with low lives. He was laughing and having a good time just days after her passing selling the same poison that killed her. After his friends dipped back into their home and he made his way back to his car I went to confront him. I guess my stance or my gait was offensive because he barely caught a glimpse of me before taking a swing. I didn't even get a word in before he knocked my cheek sideways. He wasn't ready for my grief, he wasn't ready for my hate. Even though we were probably in the same weight class I threw him against the car like a rag doll, sat on him and beat his face till my broken nose carved into my hand. It snapped me out of it and I panicked, he was barely breathing and could barely make out any facial features. I used his cell phone to call for a paramedic and left.  I didn't think someone could survive what i did to him since the pavement had done a number on the back of his head. 

For several months I imagined that he was dead and it cost me an unhealthy amount of sleep. I lost weight and could barely function in my workplace. I can't tell you how to get over it because I never did. I found out that he pulled through with some surgery to his face. After finding enough heroine in his pockets to prove intent to sell in the hospital they searched his car and found half a pound. As far as I know he's still in jail, and I don't think he ever met me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not an officer, but as the boyfriend of an administrator for a campus I often get to talk to and shadow cops with the gf.

A while back this group of friends went to the beach for a small party.one of the girls got so drunk that they had to drag her to the car and apparently the seating situation had changed some point in the day ? Because one of these bright bulbs decided that since there weren't enough seats and she might throw up that they'd put her in the trunk. A unrelated beach goer say this and of course called the cops with a report of an abduction. They made it back to the university and obviously some people in the parking lot were off put by the sight of them taking out a less than coherent female out of the back of a car. They panicked and walked her into the first dorm room with an open door, propped her up in a corner so she wouldn't drown in her own vomit and scattered like roaches.

<TEXT> Ive got two. 

On August 1st of last year there was a large airsoft game at a local airsoft field and I was too ready to join in the 40 v 40 meyhem. We had active vehicles in play and during one of our "demolition" styled objectives I noticed that a ford suv was headed our way from across the map. I called it out to my near by team mates and they dug in waiting for the fully loaded monster to come in and reinforce the players near us. I carried a thumper (single shot vietnam grenade launcher) on a sling as my secondary and knew that no one else near by had anything else that could do anything about it. The way that my grenade launcher works in airsoft is that the nerf projectile that it fires (at about the speed of a tear gas launcher) kills anyone within fifteen feet of where it lands. if it hits the side of the vehicle then it immobilizes it, and two will kill it. 

I propped myself up against a building and waited for it, the second I saw the driver I squeezed the trigger and the nerf rocket decked the guy in the passenger seat behind him dead in the cheek killing all of the passengers and giving us the edge we needed to take the "bomb" and plant it at the enemy's objective. Absolutely priceless moment. 

this is footage from that day, the camera drone flying around was at a bad angle for my kill but you can see the aftermath.

<TEXT> Before I go tooting my own horn, I will go on record in saying that my shaft is nothing special in the size department. And that I have a respectable sexual track record, but nothing near some others. More than fifty minutes, less than an hour and a half. She came five times and I managed to stay hard after the first go just enough to go twice. 

I can't tell my friends about it because it was a stoned night with a buddies gf.  </TEXT>

Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees, conformity,
Or dying on your feet for honesty,
Inbred, our bodies work as one,
Bloody, but never cry submission,
Following our instinct not a trend,
Go against the grain until the end

<TEXT> Not in the world friend, mostly in the US. this spawns from slavery and segregation I imagine. I mean, my mom is old enough to remember the signs and the beatings. The KKK gave Birmingham the nick name Bombingham for a period of time and were never really tried as a terrorist group and are still allowed to gather today. A good portion of folks that supported segregation are still alive today and have loosely taught their kids the same racial BS. 

Seems to me like this country is trying to squash out the last kinks in this whole racial squabble. Hopefully in my life time I will see racism swing into full taboo instead of it just being a common choice folks make.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was nine there was a girl who was kind to me and we played tether ball together every now and again. One day she got in a disagreement with a friend of mine and she knocked her down. She then proceeded to tease her while she was down and not let her get up. A few others and I joined in on the teasing. 

I saw her at a barns and noble a few years ago in my adult life and we talked about where our life had taken us since then. Somewhere in that conversation I brought it up and she didn't even remember that I was there. Sometimes I forget what where I put my keys but I remember the look on her face as we teased her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was heading back home and decided to take a scenic highway back because the shorter route was gridlocked with traffic. an SUV had flipped over in some kind of accident and my self and two other cars had stopped to see what had happened. We were the first to call emergency services but the car was smoking and starting to catch. There was only a woman driving but caught on her belt and beaten pretty badly.

One of the guys was fearless and jumped onto the car that was on it's side and was scrambling to get her out. You could barely see the woman in the smoke. He tried to kick in the window, I scrambled and gave him my knife. It had a pike on the handle meant for just the thing, he shattered the window and cut her seat belt. He pulled her out and handed her to me and checked for more injured. I know the other driver has a lot of credit to be given but I still feel proud of that day. Others had stopped and were scared that the car was going to catch on fire and watched. But that other driver and I helped.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My brother was heavily medicated due to a serious medical condition. We didn't live in the same house hold so for over a year we played with friends Red Dead Redemption on the Xbox360.  

My brother was out of it but still game for another hour or two. We were in the mexican portion of the map and we started saying that Rockstar was playing Return of the Jedi for May 4th at the Blackwater theater on the other side of the map. My brother discounted it but one of my other friends in the party put himself at the theater on the map and without missing a beat started playing the theme over the mic. He hopped on a zebra donkey and we road after him as best as we could XD </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because the definition of an "assault weapon" has been broadened to include weapons that flat out don't fit the definition. Laws are passed by idiots that don't know anything about the items they are prohibiting. 

As a Californian it is illegal for me to purchase a bean bag round for my shot gun. A non lethal round that can stop an intruder or hostile individual with a minimal chance of lethally wounding them. But I guess bird shot "wich is essentially metal sand" that can definitely mortally wound an intruder is fair game.  

Laws should be made by people who understand what they're talking about.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right ? The other day we were walking to our car from a sushi joint and there are two cars in the parking lot. Ours, and a four door with three duds being loud and sketchy. 

I told her to get behind me, I keep a four inch utility knife on me almost everytime I go out. We just got done having a disagreement over whether she should do the same. She made the point she didn't want to learn how to cut someone and she'd probably end up getting her own knife used against her.

We ended up getting out of there without issue but if something had happened it would have been 3v1 instead of 3v2.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was 8ish, I took a trip to mexico to visit family and friends. I don't believe in ghosts so I write it off as some jack ass being a freak. But outside on the street around 3am I awoke to to a horse drawn cart slowly clopping by. There wasn't much light but i could tell it was a man and he was old, and pretty tall. He was dragging chains.

I woke up my aunt to ask and get her to see. She told me it was the devil looking for souls, and that I should go to bed. I slept on the carpet in their room after that on top of some of my blankets.

<TEXT> A while back I had gone through a nasty loss that set me into a depression. I was the oldest of four and was pretty good about maintaining a the rock title in my family so when I moved in with my partner I filled that role.

My partner was going through a masters program and I couldn't bare to add anymore weight to the load. I drove up to a spot I liked in the forest and left a note in my car and almost stepped off of a 3,000 foot drop. I thought about my family and what i'd do to them, what we'd already been through and the life i'd leave behind.
 
That night I approached my partner after what felt like the longest drive of my life and confided everything I held back. But I never shared the story of the cliff, and I burnt the note.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [ The Second Coming ] (forgive me because it's been a long time since i've studied the bible)

Jesus was in his early twenties when god revealed to him that he was his son right ?  Well through drunken bondfire talk we've gathered that there is really nothing stopping god from choosing another child right ?  

the story follows a random twenty something (male or female) that wakes up one day to the booming voice of god. This person is told that they will be granted more and more of god's powers as the days pass. and that they have to decide if the fate of humanity. 

the salvation from the act of jesus has expired and time has come again to decide whether or not we are worthy. So the story follows this character and they can choose to become the second comming of Jesus or the Antichrist.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was behind a woman at a red light earlier this week when I noticed she was on her phone. I honked and she looked up and around with an expression that said "He must be honking at some one else, i'm clearly doing nothing wrong,".

When the light turned green she didn't make it much more that 100m before she pulled into her left lane so much so that the driver next to her had to get out of the way so that they didn't get mashed into a concrete divider. When we got to the next red light i honked at her and motioned for her to roll down her window. I tried to maintain my composure and said " hey, you need to get off your phone ! you nearly killed some one!".

This didn't sit well with her "fuck you ! don't tell me how to drive faggot !!," she replied.  </TEXT>
