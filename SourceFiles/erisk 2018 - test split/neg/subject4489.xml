The slight buzzing of my phone woke me from my sleep. The soft seat of the bus had put me in a slumber. As the sun rose from the eastern sky, the bus rolled past the sign that read:
"WELCOME TO COLORFUL COLORADO." I took a look back at the buzzing phone. It was a call from Lisa. I quickly snatched the device and answered the screen. Most people on the bus were still sleeping, so I had to whisper. "Hey Lisa, you alright, are you safe?" I asked. There was a small pause, but then Lisa's voice answered back. "I am back at HQ, thank you for asking, but first, touch the scanner on the bottom of the device." I looked at the bottom of the phone, and noticed a fingerprint sized pad. I put my pointer finger on it. Instantly, the environment around me changed.

 The people on the bus had disappeared, and the bus itself vanished as well. It was all white around me. Another five seconds later, a familiar sight emerged. My office room formed around me. My desk, computer, and everything else came into existence around me. At the same time, Lisa just appeared in front me. Her smiling face greeted me as we walked up to each other. She spoke first. "New technology that we're testing, how is it?" "Unbelievable...." I answered, "So am I still on the bus?" "Yes," Lisa replied, "All of what you see is in your brain. The scanner interlocked with your DNA, and your brain to act as a receiving signal. It then-" I stopped her. "I got it Lisa. No need to explain it," I said. She sort of smiled, and than put on her serious face. "Let's get to the point," she said as she pulled up holographic images of newspaper articles. The news depicted another death. An executive was killed in a "car crash". His head was swiped clean off. He was related to T.E.R.C.E.S. In case you
guys are wondering, outside of the agency, no one is allowed to speak about the organization. There are rules. So, all of the organization's executives act like normal businesspeople for precautions. Anyways, that was another death to the list. "A.I's on the move again," I said. "Read the county's name where the body was found," Lisa replied. I glanced at the top of the heading of the column. "Colorado," I answered. 

"He wants to tell me that he's waiting for me," I said as I took a seat on my office chair. I still couldn't process the whole environment. It was like I was back home, back in my office. But I had to tell myself that this was all in my head. I wasn't really in my office. We both sat in silence, until I said, "I'm still going to find him." Lisa just looked at me, a gentle look, a look of hopefulness and appreciation. Suddenly, a noise rang, and I kept feeling something on my shoulder.  "Looks like you're bus has reached its stop, and someone's tapping on your shoulder, thinking you're asleep," Lisa explained. "I guess I have to go Lisa, thanks for everything," I replied. Lisa walked over and gave me a kiss on the cheek. Before I could say anything, Lisa pressed a device somewhere on the desk, and everything went black.

My mind basically drifted back to the bus. I woke up, and was greeted by the sight of an old man. " 'Bout time you woke up, I thought you were damn unconscious," he said as I regained my senses. "Yeah, sorry about that, was in a deep sleep," I answered back. "All's good, we've reached (city taken out for purposes)," the old dude stated. "Thanks," I said as I put the tech phone in my bag, and stood up. I stretched a little bit, and then proceeded to exit the bus.  

I've finally arrived in Colorado. Now, to find A.I. I stopped at a local bazaar, and ordered a sandwich, fries, and coffee. Sitting at the table, I glanced over A.I's file. I looked at the street name where the crash occurred, it was not too far from here. My thoughts also drifted back to Lisa. I didn't know what to say about the kiss. I mean, I like her too, but she never told me that she had the same feelings either. My thought-process was interrupted when the waitress brought the coffee and food. The savory aroma made my stomach gurgle. After my lunch, the time was 1:22p.m. I went and changed in the bathroom, payed for the lunch, and proceeded to the scene of the accident. 

I followed the information on the file, and the GPS on my tech phone. After a few minutes of walking, I arrived a the scene of the accident. I scanned the surroundings. There was a memorial for A.I's wife and child. The pictures of them were exactly like the ones in the file. All around, there were many flowers of all kinds, candles, and letters. I kneeled down to closer inspect the surrounding. There was bits of debris from the wreck, and also what looked to be dried blood. As I was scanning the area, I spotted a shadow next to me. I couldn't react fast enough. I was struck in the back of the head. Immense pain throbbed its way through my body, as my brain wobbled, and my sight became dizzy. I felt my self fall backwards as I was knocked unconscious.

When I woke up, I was in an abandoned warehouse. Typical place for a killer, I should have expected this. I tasted blood in my mouth, and my head ached like hell. I suddenly heard footsteps coming closer, but I couldn't see anything through the darkness of the warehouse. I tried to get up, but my hands and feet were tied together with chains. "I wouldn't try if I were you," the voice echoed, "it won't end well." "Let me guess, you're Matthew," I mumbled. " Well done agent," the voice answered, as the footsteps grew nearer. I could make out a silhouette, but as the figure grew closer, it became more distinct. Standing in front of me was Matthew aka A.I. He had lost the glasses, revealing two dark brown eyes, with a small scar through the bottom part of the left eye. He had a small beard, and was wearing a green cap. He had on a loose jacket, black army pants, and military boots. He put an eye patch over the left eye as he walked towards me. He kneeled down in front of me. "So, I heard you wanted to find me, here I am," A.I. stated. "Take off these chains, and I'll introduce myself too," I answered back, sarcastically. 

"If I wanted, you would already be dead," A.I said, laughing as he got up. "So why keep me here!?" I shouted, "Why keep me alive?" A.I. paused for a moment. "I need your help," he finally answered."What do you mean?" I questioned, a little curious. "You're on of the best agents I knew at T.E.R.C.E.S., and I think you're the only one I trust. They're not good people," A.I. said, his tone turning dark. "But why kill them?" I questioned further. "Self defense. They were hired to kill me," he replied, "It...wasn't supposed to happen. Look, I don't want to hurt anyone, I just need your help." "How can I trust you?" I asked. He walked up to me and untied my chains. I could have punched him right there, but I chose not to do it, it didn't seem right. "You're a strong man, agent," A.I said as he offered his hand, "can you help me?" I took his hand and he pulled me up. My head still hurt. "Sorry about your head, I didn't want to risk us getting caught," he replied. "You're being followed?" I asked. "No," he answered, "you are."

"What are you talking about?" I questioned. "There's a tracker in your bag." A.I. held up a micro chip tracker. "They're trying to capture me, cause I'm the only one who knows the real truth," A.I. continued. "Are they trying to hide something?" I asked. I was starting to question my agency's authenticity. Why were they trying to capture A.I. so badly? "Yes, it's a long story but I'll sum it up for you," A.I. said, "Do you know how my wife and child died? It wasn't an accident, it was murder." "Murder? but who would want to kill your family?" I said, "wait," I stopped myself, "you're saying T.E.R.C.E.S was behind all this?" "Exactly," A.I. confirmed, in a sad, depressed tone of voice. "My poor family was innocent, had nothing to do with it, but when I found the hidden side of T.E.R.C.E.S, they stopped at nothing to eliminate me, including my family...." A.I. explained, his face turning away from me, "But now, I'm going to bring an end to their act." "What are they wanting to hide so badly?" I said, wanting to know the real truth. "Weapons of mass destruction. These weapons have incalculable uses. Controlling minds, viruses, destruction, anything, you name it. It can end major populations, allowing T.E.R.C.E.S to take over the world," A.I answered. This sounds like something from a movie, I thought, but then again, has anything normal happened lately? 

A.I reached to some papers lying on a desk in the corner that I hadn't noticed before. "This is proof," he told me. He handed me the papers. I looked at them. Sure enough, he was right. These were records of weapons being developed to take over massive countries, and they had many uses, just like A.I had mentioned. There were photographs of the machinery as well. "Damn, they love to keep secrets," I implied. "You think?" A.I reasoned, "spell T.E.R.C.E.S. backwards: S.E.C.R.E.T."

"We have to stop them A.I." I said. Dammit, forgot to tell him that I called him A.I. "A.I.? Is that what you're calling me now? he thought for a second, I kinda like it," A.I said, "and yes, we have to bring an end to this."Suddenly, my tech phone rang in my bag. I ran towards the bag, and grabbed my phone. There was a voice message from Lisa: "I've been listening in on your conversation, what he said is true. I hacked the databases, and sure enough, I found proof, and I've sent it to your phone. They're coming for me now, and they'll get to you guys, get out of there, go end this! "We have to get out of here!" A.I. shouted, "follow me!" "We have to save Lisa!" I shouted back. "We'll save your friend, but right now, I need you to come with me," he replied. And so, I followed A.I. Our mission was set. We are going to end this once and for all. Whoever's behind this, we'll find him. I'll keep you updated. This is me signing off for now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/68p4ra/on_the_run_part_1_captured/

I can't believe my eyes. Sitting right before me are two distinct packages. They've finally arrived. From the outside, they appeared to be just normal cardboard boxes that looked a little torn up, but I know better. From behind me, I heard the cell door unlock and two officers walked in. Their bright uniforms reflected the sunlight of dawn breaking through a miniscule window on the far side of a room outside the cell. "Hello officers, what's up?" I asked, trying to sound non-suspicious. "We just need to check those packages," said Officer Graham(name's on uniform), while eyeing me with his dark shades. His stern look than switched to the packages on my desk. "We're just following saftey precautions and procedures to ensure that everything's fine," added Officer Billy. Billy was shorter than Graham, but had more muscularity, and a mustache. "Sure thing officers," I replied as they walked towards the desk. Billy proceeded to open the packages, and I awaited patiently. 

"Well..." Billy said, "Looks like you're into reading." He picked up a couple of books from the first package, while Graham examined other paperbacks in the second package. "Yeah..." I tried to sound believable, "I think one of my colleagues must have sent this..I guess they don't want me getting bored." "Ok than, looks like we're done here, thanks for letting us check," Billy said, as he proceeded to walk out of the cell. "No problem..." I replied, as Officer Graham eyed me suspiciously as he too, walked out of the cell. I heard the lock click into place as Billy locked it from the outside, and the two officers walked away. 

As soon as they were gone, I went straight to the packages. I pulled the books out and examined them. Only a couple had stickers on them. These were the names of the ones that had stickers: "Skating Inventory," "Darwin," "Energy   Production," "Adventure Night," and the last book was "Edison   Light." Well, you might be thinking, those are just random books, however, they're not. Did you find the hidden message? Take the first letters of each word in order that they are mentioned: S I D E P A N E L. "Side panel," I whispered aloud to myself. 

I checked the sides of the book cover, and then the box itself. In the box, there were small spaces on the inside along the sides. I slid my hand inside these spaces until I came to a miniscule button. I clicked on it. Suddenly, one of the books on the desk started vibrating. I scurried over and picked it up. The vibrating slowed. I started flipping through the pages, one by one, until the vibrating stopped. It was page 42. I flipped the page to 43, the vibrating started again, then I flipped it back to 42, and the vibrating stopped. "Looks like 42 is the page," I whispered to myself. I started reading. I included an excerpt of the page here:
___________________________________________________________________________________________

"Click, crackle. The sounds of the bushes crackling scared the old man. Walking along the woods was an adventure of the night. Hopefully, nothing will end the peaceful moonlight. The scurrying of the sounds of deat bewildered him. He was frightened, and alone. The sounds only grew louder. 

On the evening of winter, the snow freezed his warm body, as he slowly walked through the anonymous woods. The dead trees towered over him, like the sun over the sky. Peace, thats all. The old man heard the sounds grow louder, but he was too late. The shadow was behind him already.

Last, but not least, the man ran. He ran with all his might. His old legs gave away, and his face hit the cold snow. The shadow was there. Watching him. Laughing at him, as it moved closer. 

Word spread quickly around the town of the old man's death. They never found his body. It was like he had disappeared. Gone, astray, as if life was meaningless, uncherishable, and only the light shown above the winter wonderland."

___________________________________________________________________________________________

There is a hidden message in this excerpt as well. Take the first word of each paragraph: Click, On, Last, Word. The last word on the page is wonderland. I touched the word on the page. For a minute nothing happened, but then the page started to glow. A small holographic image appeared on where the words were. It was Lisa. "About time," she said, we now have your location." Then the image faded before I had time to reply. After 1 minute, I heard the sirens go off. The sounds of gunfire echoed through the cells. A quick moment later, my cell door was blasted open, and Lisa walked. "Quick!" Lisa said, "We don't have time to talk..here take this." She handed me a black bag. "It has everything you need" Lisa yelled over the gunfire. "But..." I started to say. "No time...now go!" She yelled. She blasted a hole in the wall with a seismic gadget, and told me to jump. I took one last look, and gave a thanks, before jumping.  

I landed a bit too hard on my elbow. I quickly got up and took off running. I finally reached a town and found a public restroom. I then checked the bag's contents. Fresh clothes, weapons, granola bars, tech gadgets, money, and a phone. She was right, it had everything. I washed myself up, and put on fresh clothes. I loaded the weapons, the usual, guns, knives, and I equipped it to my belt. I made sure that all the gadgets, including the phone, worked. All of these items are not the usual accessories that you normally see. These are modified, mproved, gadets that serve many purposes. They are crafted by special T.E.R.C.E.S. engineers. Anyways, after I was ready, I started off again on my mission.

Currently, I'm catching a bus to Colorado. I'm going to find A.I. That jail was a minor drawback. I don't know if A.I's good or bad, but I'm going to the scene of the accident. He's going to be there. The next update's coming real soon. Be ready. Signing off for now.

<TITLE> On The Run Part 1; Captured </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-02 00:10:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Well, you're probably scrolling through these stories, and you stumbled upon this one for some reason. I congratulate you first of all for reading this, because things are about to get intense. This isn't the story that ends happily, heck, I don't even think it has an ending to all the madness that's about to happen. Anyways, you better be prepared to take in a lot of information. As one wise person said: "Hold on to your damn butts."

To start off with, I'm in jail. Great right? It's not as bad as you think it is. You get three meals a day, shelter, and roommates. The cell has a bathroom built in, and a shelf with books. But, It still gets boring here. I'm stuck with my roommate, Rockjaw, a bloodthirsty killer, notorious for mass murders. Just kidding, I got you didn't I? Rockjaw's real name is Gilbert, and he's not a killer. He's a hilarious, army captain, that is serving 3 years-sentence for kicking the ass of a higher officer. He was called Rockjaw in the army, but his closest buds call him Bert. 

Now you're probably thinking: Why the hell are you in jail for? My answer: It's a long, dang, story. Plus, I'm innocent. Well, I think it's time for a flashback I guess. 

I work for an agency called T.E.R.C.E.S. I can't tell you what it stands for, because of security reasons.(Also because I can't remember what it stands for half the time either.) If you didn't guess already, I'm a private agent, hired by this 3rd party agency to investigate many unsolvable cases. I'm not the only one who works at this company either, they have other  private intelligent officers as well. Why am I telling you all of this? Well, its good to have an audience to tell your story to, and I'm in jail anyway, so why the heck not. Anyways, I was in charge of handling a very unusual case. The file belonged to a former secret agent that basically went to the dark side. The agent worked here, and I've seen him a couple of times before. No one knew him, except for me. I only know a little bit about him from the very few times we talked. His name is Matt Pierce. However, when I was handed this file, I was told that every bit of information about him is wrong, including his name. So I guess we'll call him A.I.(Anonymous Intelligence) cause it sounds cool. 

A.I. was the most outstanding agent the company had ever had. No one ever came close to his most dangerous accomplishments. He had gone on missions that no one even dared to sign up for. He sort of turned out to be a model for everyone to follow. A.I. and I weren't friends, we were more like "acquaintances."  We occasionally talked while working out in the training room. He was a quiet, wise, person. No one knew
anything about his past. I managed to get him to talk about his family one time though. He said that he had a wife and a child that had died, but that's all he said before he changed the subject. As the days went by, A.I. had disappeared. Word had gotten out that A.I. had murdered some executive officers that were in charge of T.E.R.C.E.S., and that he had escaped. Something caused him to turn bad, murderous. A couple of days later, there were more reports of deaths, all of them people who were related to T.E.R.C.E.S. They were important officers. None of our best agents found A.I., that's because we found their lifeless bodies in random places. 

As I was examining more of A.I's file, I realized that the reason why they gave me this. I was the only one who had actually talked to him. I was the only one that knew A.I, sort of. I heard a knock at my office door, and Lisa walked in. Lisa was the agent director that was in charge of a sector group of private agents. "Well, what do you think of it? she asked, while she took a seat in one of the office chairs. "It's life or death," I replied. Lisa agreed, "We're trusting you with it because you're one of the best agents we have, are you up for the challenge?" 
"Oh, I'm up for it, I said, but first, you need to supply me with all the tech, and cash that I need, cause I am not about to die for nothing." "Of course, Lisa replied, I'll get you a check, and all the machinery that you need to assist you." "Sounds great," I answered, as Lisa walked out of the office. I thought it was going to be great, silly me, little did I know that it was going to be the exact opposite. 

I stayed well after 12 digging up what I could find about A.I. From what I searched, A.I. was a normal individual. He was an outstanding agent. There was no obvious reason for him to turn bad. There was this one tragedy though. A.I's wife and child had died in a car crash, but they  had closed that case a long time ago. I decided that I had to start somewhere, so I booked a ticket to Colorado, the state of where the crash happened.

The day before the flight, I stayed in a hotel. I figured that, since I'm going on this suicidal mission, I might as well get some enjoyment. Just the usual stuff, hot tub, getting laid, and sleep. The next morning, I was on my way to Colorado. The business class cabin was ok as always. I stared out the window as the 737 took off the runway. The soft roar of the engine made me feel drowsy. Suddenly I felt a tap on my shoulder, and I looked back. I was greeted by a man with a clean-shaved beard, sunglasses, and a dark hat. He had a soft, familiar smile, and was wearing 
a navy jacket over a buttoned black shirt. "The attendants are coming out with snacks," he said. I didn't notice this guy earlier. He sat across the seat aisle on the other side. "Thanks for the heads up," I replied, smiling. "No prob, my name's Matthew by the way," he said as he offered his hand. "Name's (taken out for purposes), nice to meet you," I said as I shook his hand. That was all the conversation we had the whole flight. 

We were about an hour into the flight when the commotion started. People started freaking out and flight attendants were trying to calm everyone down. I looked to my left. Matthew wasn't there. Where did the dude go? Maybe he was in the bathroom. Word got around that there was a bomb in the plane. I didn't need to question that rumor, because suddenly there was an explosion, that shook everyone's seat. I looked out my window. The right engine of the planes was engulfed in flames. 

"Wtf!," I muttered to myself as I made my way out of my seat. The plane started to take a nosedive. It lurched my body forward, and I went flying into the cockpit. I fractured a rib in the process. I heard it crack as I landed on my side. It freaking hurt. But that wasn't the problem, both the pilots were unconscious. They were shot. I pulled one of them off their seat and quickly scrambled into the captain's chair. I know how a plane works, because it was part of the training program. We were required to learn to fly tons of aircraft. The only problem here, was that we had lost one engine. I managed to stop the nosedive, but we were going down fast. The plane glided towards the ground until it crashed into the earth below.

Minutes later, crews were evacuating passengers. Medical doctors were treating injuries. I got my rib stitched up. Afterwards, officers checked everyone. I walked up to an officer and he scanned my head, shirt, and then my arm all the way to my right hand...beep, beep. That was the sound of the scanning machine as it towered over my hand. The police officer eyed me suspiciously and walked me over to an x-ray machine. After
the x-ray was finished, the news sent shockwaves through my body. They had a found a miniscule device on my hand that was connected to the engine of the 737. It caused it to malfunction and explode, as the timer went off on the device. "Officer...I don't have anything to do with this...." I said. "That's what they all say.." the officer replied as he put me in handcuffs. 

So here I am. In jail. I'm supposed to serve a couple of years. I couldn't even tell them that I was an agent. It would expose the whole private agent network. As I was contemplating what to do, the daily mail came. There were two letters for me. The first one was a letter from my agency, carefully concealed to look like a letter from an insurance company. I decoded the message, and it said that I was going to receive packages that are going to help me bust the hell out of here. Good news, but I will have to wait. The second letter was anonymous. All it said was: "Don't 
follow me, or the plane incident won't be the last..." There was a portrait picture of...wait for it...the dude I met on the plane: Matthew. Well, I sort of knew that was going to happen. Looks like A.I. was Matthew.

A.I's on the run and I'm going to catch him. He'll come in all disguises, anywhere, and anytime. I will be ready for him. But first, I'll have to bust out of here. Looks like the only way are through those packages. I'll have to wait until they arrive. Well, looks like that's it. This is me signing off this crappy computer that they let you use. I will keep you guys updated.

<TITLE> The Message... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-09 16:26:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The message was seen everywhere, including social media. It started in my county. There were written messages that were put up everywhere. I read it and it freaked me out. I have posted it here. See for yourselves:

"It's Them. They're dangerous, unpredictable. I'm stranded here by myself. I need help. I have put this message up everywhere for my commander to see. In this place, this system called "uploading" grabs a lot of attention through views. Hopefully he will see this, and send assistance. It's like I am trapped in a cage, with no where else to go. It's a big world out here. I'm trying to stay out of sight, away from the creatures that roam this place. If I get caught, I'm in trouble. A whole lot of trouble. The towering structures cast shadows across the landscape. I walk endlessly through the paved paths. Luckily, I'm alone, for now.

It's getting dark, and I have nothing to sustain me. I'll have to venture out in order to survive. I am in an area that doesn't seem to host these creatures, probably because it's nighttime. The temperature dips below 35 degrees, and the wind starts picking up. I have adapted to some of these temperatures, so it doesn't affect me, too much. There are standing lights that navigate around these paths. The structures continue to rise in the moonlight. There are pictures of these creatures strewn across everywhere. Each creature looks different, and has different characteristics. I studied them carefully.

The first hint of light burst through the canopy of the greenery planted everywhere. For the most part, everything was peaceful. The temperature is over 60 degrees right now. The sky is a shade of orange and blue. The light burned my eyes, however the shade of the dark protected me. Suddenly, I heard noises. The creatures were coming out.

There are objects that these creatures use to get around. It made them move fast. Extraordinary. They communicated with each other, in a series if dialects that I now understand. There were creatures of different sizes big, and small. Everything seems alright, and peaceful, but I know better. These creatures can turn angry, and do disastrous things. They have strong military equipment. They can be deadly. That is why I have to take them out.

I am doing more research, commander. The creatures call themselves...humans. They are intelligent, two-legged organisms. They are situated all around this planet.  We have
 to do an all-out attack. This intelligent life should not be taken easily unlike the other planets we've taken over. I have learned their language, and will blend in with them. I will use the camouflage equipment to disguise myself as a "human." They will never find me, no matter how hard they try. I will find their weak points. Until my commander reaches here, I will have to be in hiding. If it comes to it, I will not go down without a fight! Be prepared humans! My commander is near." (End of Message)

I don't know if people will believe this. Is there an alien stalking us? Will they take over earth? There have been several cases of people  that are disappearing. Children are missing. Something big is coming and we have to be prepared. We have to be strong. When the time comes, we have to be ready, 'cause I'm not going down without a fight either.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First Part: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5zfcoq/the_mystery_of_fallen_creek_orphanage_part_1/

(This part is dedicated to Gorey58, a great Reddit user.) 

As the days pass, I'm getting less and less sleep... My eyes are heavy with weariness, and it is becoming harder to focus in school. I find myself falling asleep in all my classes. Now I am afraid of falling asleep when I ride my bike back to the orphanage. The noises occur every night. The other boys try to sleep as best as they can. The creepy noises are freaking everyone out. We've heard footsteps of little children playing, and laughing. Other times you can hear crying, and scratching behind our dorm room door. The boys and I have huddled our bunk beds together as far away from the door. We've also barricaded it and placed metal cans around it in case whatever is outside decides to come in. We've told the girls to do the same thing as well. I do not how long I am going to last in this place. I seem to have a connection with all of the creepiness going on. We try to sleep by blocking the sounds out with cotton or something that we can plug into our ears, at least it gives some sort of relief. As the day went by, it was time to go to bed again.I walked towards my dorm room as the lights were getting turned off. 

As usual, I was the last one who got there. All the other boys were already in their bunk beds. I made sure the door was nice and locked and proceeded to my bed which was not that far away from the door. Normally, when I go to sleep, I try to sleep as fast as possible. This time, I couldn't make myself sleep. I kept thinking about a lot of memories that were passing through my mind. I tried to ignore the chill, creepy laughter that had just started outside the dorm-room door. 

When I want to move away from the noise, and chaos, I end up zoning out. As I was laying on the top bunk, my mind drifted away to my memories, I felt the noises lessen, as I started to remember my past. I saw the face of my Great Aunt, smiling, her white-crested teeth showing. The sunshine from the window was casting an aurora on her making her seem like she was glowing. My Great aunt was the best. Ever since my parents had died, I have been with her. I hardly remember my parents, it was like they just vanished, gone. All I knew was that I was put in the care of my Great Aunt. I forgot to mention her name. Her real name is Margareaux Gilbert but she likes to be called Aunt Maggie. I have been with her for 13 years. She took care of me, and taught me everything. The scented aroma of her cooking still makes my mouth water. Aunt Maggie was also a great teacher. She homeschooled me in the classroom that she made as part of her 2 story, humble house in a quiet neighborhood outside of town. It was very peaceful there. I remember the pictures of her husband, Donald Gilbert, a veteran who died while he was fighting in the army. 

I recollected Aunt Maggie's sullen expression when she returned home from a checkup at the hospital one day. She came and wrapped me in a hug as her eyes filled with tears. I asked her what was wrong. She didn't answer. That night, she made a whole table filled with all of my favorite dishes. She played games with me. She hugged me more. I told her that I loved her,( I don't know, it just came out automatically), Aunt Maggie smiled and told me that I will never be alone. I did not get what that meant at that time. Aunt Maggie came in that night to my room. She sat at the bed for a few minutes and just rubbed my forehead. She told me she will miss me. I was confused, but her soft, gentle, hand soothed me to sleep.

 The next day, I woke up extra early to make Aunt Maggie a surprise breakfast. I wanted to show her how much I appreciated everything she's done for me. I fixed the breakfast, and brought it in a tray to Aunt Maggie's room door. I called her name twice, no answer. I opened the door to the bed where I saw the sight that made me drop my tray. Aunt Maggie was lying there, the blood drained from her face, her pupils were red, and there was blood dripping from her mouth. The white sheets of the bed were shaded a dark, bloody, red. Aunt Maggie had veins sticking out of her arms and face, almost as if her body tensed up from the inside. Her once peaceful face, was now a sight of horror. Her eyes stared upward into darkness, and her whole body was a pale, gray, color. I will never forget that sight. I called the police, and soon a whole group of trucks, police cars, and ambulances surrounded the house. I sat on the stairway of the porch watching them take Aunt Maggie's lifeless body away on a stretcher. 

The doctor came up and sat next to me. He asked if me if I noticed anything wrong with my aunt when she returned home that day. I told him that Aunt Maggie did seem depressed that night. I told him everything that happened. He told me the autopsy report that they just conducted. My aunt had a disease (the name was too long to write down) that messed with the internal organs of her body. Her bodily functions just stopped working, and sort of exploded. It caused blood ruptures to spread everywhere,(that explained the red pupils). The doctor told me that the disease had a very painful process as it destroyed the body. The thought left me in more tears. The doctor sadly patted my back as he went away.  

The health officials brought me to the orphanage the next day. Before that, I was in the hospital for tests to make sure that I did not contain the disease. When I was taken to the orphanage, it was the most gloomiest day of my life. I remember that day so vividly. The sun was blocked out by the stormy clouds that were closing in. The officials brought me through the front gates to the grumpy old head mistress. She looked at all my files, and thanked the officials for coming. And from that day on, the orphanage became my new home. 

My mind returned back to reality when I was startled by a loud scream that echoed through my eardrums. All the other boys were awaken by the shriek. We then heard our names being called out by voices behind the dorm room door. I got out of bed and ran to the door. The boys were close behind me. I slowly unlocked the door and opened it. Behind it was.......nothing. Just the chill air of the creepy orphanage that greeted me. I turned to look back at the boys. Their faces had a petrified look filled with fear. I told them to stay put. Surprisingly, they listened. They all returned to their bunk beds...all except for Jimmy. I've mentioned Jimmy before. He was my so-called "acquaintance" who actually talked to me. He knew many secrets about this orphanage. No one knows Jimmy's background, or where he was even born. Everyone's files are kept in the head mistress' main office. 

Anyways, Jimmy asked me where I was going. I told him that I'm going to figure out what's wrong with this place. Why all the creepy children's voices started when I arrived here, there must be some connection. Jimmy stared at me and smiled. He replied, "Well, looks like you'll need some help than." Before I could tell him that this may get him into trouble too, he raced back to his lower bunk in the corner and pulled out a bag from under the bed. He took something that looked like a photograph and stared at it for a few seconds. He then put it back in his bag and slid it under the bed. "Let's Go!" he said silently as he walked past me through the dorm room door. 

To be honest, I've never seen the hallways of the orphanage late at night before. We always stayed in our dorm room, and no one dared to go out at night especially since the creepy noises had started. (If you're wondering, we have a bathroom in our room, so we did not have to go out of the room in case of an emergency). Jimmy and I made our way slowly to the end of the hallway. For some reason, they didn't have security cameras at this end of the corridor, so we were fine for now. The dark, gloomy, corridor had many doors leading to many places. There were barely any lights except for the dim rays that seeped through the windows from the full moon outside. Jimmy spotted a vent system that was just a few inches from the ground. It looked big enough for us to fit through(how convenient). Jimmy broke open the loose hinges that held it up in place, and told me to follow him. He told me that this vent lead to the main offices. I wondered how he knew that, but that thought quickly slipped away when I heard a chill scream echo through the vents. The scream was coming from our right inside the vent. Jimmy told me to stick behind him, and we crawled our way towards the direction of the sound. 

The screaming had stopped when we reached the end of the vent. We peered through the vent openings to see what room we arrived at. It was the head mistress' office. Jimmy tore open the vent to reveal the interior of the room. There was no one inside. It was not very well maintained either. There were papers everywhere, and everything looked disorganized. The ceiling was crumbling, and there was what looked to be dried bits of blood on the wall. It looked like it had been stained with blood for years. I proceeded to examine the files on a desk in the center of the room. I went through all the cabinets while Jimmy stood watch. I finally managed to find a small box inside a cabinet. 

I opened the dusty lid of the old box, and proceeded through its contents. Inside, were many files of the orphans that used to live in this orphanage. It contained their names, a small portrait of them, and their bio data. Most of them were from the 1980s. This orphanage was pretty old. I saw Jimmy slip a piece of paper into his pocket. It was just something I noticed. I didn't really ask him why, because I didn't care. As I read more of the files, I realized that all of this kids died at a young age. The reports said that it was because of a disease from the plague that went through the village. These were the kids that were buried in the mass graveyard next door. 

There were pictures of kids and villagers being treated from the disease. The kids looked messed up. Some were missing hands, others had no eyes. Some kids looked like zombies because their bones showed in places where they had no skin. Many of them had lumps all over their small bodies, and others were missing hair, legs, or teeth. It was horrifying looking at the pictures. These were just orphans. I suddenly spotted one of the nurses helping out in the pictures. The nurse looked familiar...she looked like my aunt Maggie, no, it was my aunt Maggie. I 
recognized the same facial appearance. It was definitely her. No wonder she had the disease. It probably spread to her when she was a nurse helping out at the time. The accounts of the disease said that it could kill a person before they realized that they had it. "Why didn't Aunt Maggie tell me?" I yelled out loud. Jimmy asked me what I was talking about. I told him about the files. "She probably wanted you to not worry," he said. A sense of sadness formed inside me. I suddenly missed Aunt Maggie, and I felt more alone than I already was. 

As I stared at the pictures some more, a question arose in my head. Why were this kids missing body parts? The disease killed you from the inside out. It just messed with your organs. There was something suspicious going on. I started looking around some more, trying to see what I could find. I ended up finding nothing. I was just about to give up when I spotted something in the corner of the room. There was a handhold in the wall. I walked up to it, and felt the hold. There was something in it, almost like a button. I pushed on it. Nothing happened. "Well, I said, "looks like there's--, I didn't finished my sentence because the wall behind suddenly fell, revealing a hidden staircase.

"You got to be kidding me," I said, as I walked up to the once hidden staircase. Jimmy had a pained expression on his face, but at the same time a happy one. Before we went down the staircase, Jimmy made sure that we didn't wake anyone up. Then, we proceeded into the darkness. I had found a flashlight somewhere in the office. It still worked, so I used it to guide ourselves down the ominous staircase that spiraled down into who knows where. As we continued the walk down, the air stank of something rotting. The strong odor made me want to vomit. Weirdly, Jimmy was silent as we walked, and I couldn't tell what expression he had because of the darkness. Finally, the staircase came to an end. It lead into a tunnel that stretched into even more darkness. I kept the flashlight shown ahead as we stepped through the wet puddles of what looked like blood and water mixed together. The stench was even worse here. I couldn't hold it in, I vomited out next to me, spilling the digested liquid of my lunch. "You ok there bud,?" Jimmy asked. He grabbed the flashlight and guided me along. Why did he not feel sick? He wasn't bothered by it at all. 

The tunnel led into a room that was filled with coffins, bloody tables, bones, and bodies of skeletons. "What in hell is this place?" I said, as my voice echoed of the brick walls. There were writings written in a blood that read, HELP US, and ITS THEM, which were written in many areas. I told Jimmy to shine the flashlight at the tables.  I caught a glimpse of his face. It was a sullen, depressed, look almost like he's seen this place before. My attention shifted to the tables. I looked in horror as I saw what were on the tables. They were lined with.... torture devices.

Not only that, but there were needles, and other painful looking devices. There were bloody papers strewn across the floor and the tables. I picked one up. It had a child's face with an x marked over the picture. It was similar to the files of the orphans back in the office. I read the papers thoroughly. I realized what was going on in here. When the villagers were living in this area, there was a plague that went over that ended up killing many  adults. It was the same disease that my aunt had which was the cause of the deaths. The children weren't affected, so they built this orphanage to keep them there. However, there was something horrible going on the orphanage that no one knew about. The children were secretly being abused sexually, and also experimented on. Some of them were little kids, others were older. Almost all of them were tortured, here in this chamber, to death. That explains why there were torture devices. Very little survived, and of the orphans that made it out, they were treated by the nurses that remained here. That also explains the photo of my aunt with these tortured children. The people who ran this abuse operation targeted the nurses and....killed them. The reason why they weren't caught, was because everyone assumed that the nurses died from the disease that was spread from the plague.

 Somehow my aunt remained hidden from her pursuers for all these years. I sat in a shocked silence, as the truth seeped into me. I cried in bitter resentment towards the people who had done these things to the innocent children, and no one couldn't do anything about it. I heard something drop behind me. The flashlight that was supposed to be in Jimmy's hand rolled over to a side of the wall of the room. The light illuminated a name that was written in blood. The name sent shockwaves down my spine. It was the name of our head mistress. 

Under the name, it said, IT WAS HER FAULT. I suddenly heard something call out to me from the darkness. The room became filled with many loud voices of children echoing out to me. There was no sign of Jimmy either. The voices whispered thank you all around me. It kept echoing until all was silent. Something inside me told me to get out of here. I had to put an end to this. My heart raced as I ran towards the staircase. I didn't know where Jimmy was, but I knew what I had to do....

24 HOURS LATER...............................

The children of the orphanage stood together and watched as the cops handcuffed our head mistress and took her way in the police car. It turns out that she had known all about Fallen Creek's secret. Her father was the head of the organization to abuse and experiment on these children for a private company. They started this orphanage to make sure no one was suspicious. The plague benefited their plan as well. I was still having trouble processing all this information. Maybe I was fated to help find the mystery behind this orphanage. I surveyed the construction workers who entered our orphanage. They were excavating the torture chamber for more skeletons, and evidence. There were also new plans being made to refurnish the interior and exterior of the new orphanage to actually benefit the children. The children will have a proper home, where they are free to play, live, and grow without any difficulties. We will also get new security, because the old ones were fired for not keeping proper watch on the orphanage. They just went to the security shed outside the orphanage to drink, and sleep. There will also be a separate room in the orphanage for the staff, and security to stay in. How did I know all of this? Well, I overhead the engineers  talking about it. 

Anyway, I decided to go take a last look at my dorm room because we were going leave. The police are escorting all the children of the orphanage to a hospital wing just outside of town, while the orphanage was being constructed on. As I was walking past the pictures of the orphans on the wall, I noticed a familiar face in one of the pictures. There was a boy standing in the crowd of some orphans. As I peered closely, I realized that it was Jimmy. The date was from the 1900s. I stared in awe as I figured out that Jimmy was one of the orphans that had died. Another thought also came into my head. What if the ghosts of these children were helping me out? What if they wanted me to solve this mystery once and for all? Maybe that's why they were yelling and screaming because they wanted me to find them, to free them from their misery. I ran to my dorm room to find a piece of paper on Jimmy's bed. I slowly picked up the piece of paper that read: Thank You, You freed all of us, and for that we are grateful. The horrors that happened here are a reminder of our numbered lives. It is part of the pain we suffered. You will not be forgotten-Jimmy. 

That's why Jimmy knew all the secrets of this place, I thought, as I made my way to the police escorts outside. The children were being filed in to big police trucks. As I got in, I asked the other boys if they remembered Jimmy, but all of them denied me. They said that they never even heard of him before. The policeman started the truck, and followed the other trucks out past the gates of the orphanage. I stared at the letter written by Jimmy, and I took one last look at the gates of FALLEN CREEK ORPHANAGE. To my amaze, standing at the gate was Jimmy, waving goodbye to me as we drove away. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not the type of person anyone would like. A skinny kid who always wears shirts and leggings that are twice the size he is, I'm not your average individual. I like to be alone, to be non-sociable, away from the noise, the chaos of the world. School isn't great either. No friends except for the occasional teacher who says hello. I've just gotten used to this way of life. 

As usual, 3:12 in the afternoon, I'm returning from school, coming back from the boring day of sitting in a classroom with no one I know. No homework today though, at least that's a plus. I walk towards the bike rack to grab my 2008 model. I worked hard to raise enough money to buy this beauty. It's been with me through thick and thin, never failed on me. After about 10 minutes of riding, I approached my home.... the orphanage. "FALLEN CREEK ORPHANAGE" was displayed on the archway of the gate that overlooked the entire estate. The name was given to the orphanage because it stood next to the creek that separated it from a mass graveyard of fallen townspeople that inhabited the place. I've been at the orphanage for just a year now. I used to be living with my Great Aunt, but she lost her battle to an unknown disease.

The orphanage stood tall as I approached. It was built in 1836 by the townspeople who lived here. Now their bodies rest in peace in the graveyard next door. I'm am not usually the type of person who gets frightened easily, but this orphanage does creep out every child that lives here. After I parked my bike to the rusty, broken, old bike stand that had no chains, I walked towards the entrance and proceeded through the looming metal door. The grumpy head mistress (who had the voice of a male) yelled at me as soon as I walked in. "Where the hell have you been?, you should have gotten here ages ago!" I told her that I was on time, but there was more traffic than usual(I lied). She bellowed at me some more and told me to head straight to the dorm room. I bet she can't go to sleep without yelling at someone per day! (I thought some more things about her but its better not to mention it here.) That's what I thought to myself as I made my way to the dorm room. There were other boys messing around when I got there. The boys had their own room and the girls had their own room. There were bunk beds lined up against the walls. I went to the restroom to clean myself up, and to get ready for dinner. 

I didn't have any real friends here, but I had one "acquaintance" who talked to me. He knew all sorts of secrets about this place. He explained why there were creepy photos of little children hung on the wall. They were the orphans that used to go here at the time the townspeople inhabited this area. The little children's' bodies were dug up in the basement of the orphanage and placed in the graveyard next door. My first few days living here were fine, but that's when I started hearing the voices. I couldn't go to sleep at night. Voices of little children laughing, crying, and scratching. One time, I heard someone playing a child's toy piano as well... we had no toys at the orphanage. I wasn't the only one hearing all of this either. The other boys claimed to hear them as well. When we asked the girls, they also heard sounds as well, like a mother crying, or a women singing, while a baby was crying. You're probably asking, Why don't you tell the people who work at the orphanage? well, we did. They called us all crazy-witted kids who had a hell of an imagination. There was no point. They didn't believe us.

When it is time for all of us to go to bed, the faculty turn off all the lights, and they leave back to their homes. (I think they're scared of this place too). The security go to a separate warehouse located outside the orphanage. The orphanage has a set of cameras that record everything that goes on. The warehouse is sort of like the control center where the security officers watch the camera footage. They basically leave us alone in this creepy old place. I even doubt that the security officers are watching crap, because They probably go into the stupid warehouse to drink alcohol and sleep; they won't have any idea of what's happening inside the orphanage. I'm trying to go to sleep just like all the other kids who try to ignore the noises that have been happening for the past year. It was strange, as soon as I arrived here, the kids say that the Creepy noises started. It was almost as if I was chosen to figure out why the ghosts of these children are haunting us...

Part 2 coming soon...

<TEXT> It's your choice. Believe it or not. No, I'm not talking about that book that was published with all those wacky pictures, no, I'm talking about an event that I myself encountered. if you're reading this at night, beware, you are going to be paranoid of your surroundings from now on. This event happened awhile back...
Here we go.....

I'm sitting on my bed, spring break just started(sorry for you guys who still have school), and I'm looking at my phone laughing to myself. I'm not a weirdo. Just looking at iFunny because I had nothing else to do. It was dawn outside. Let me make one thing clear, I'm all alone. My parents had to go somewhere for reasons, and I was left at home. Don't worry, I'm old enough to stay at home by myself. 

So I'm sitting here and I start to here sounds above my head. I figured since my bed is in front of window with a curtain, I thought the sound was coming from somewhere outside. I ignore it, and I go back to looking on my phone. An hour or two later, it was starting to get dark outside and I was starting to get hungry too. I'm about to exit my room and I hear the sound again. the weird thing is that it started to rain outside just as I heard it. I go to look outside the window and I see this tall figure standing next to the tree outside my house. I'm not joking, that thing was creepy as heck and it creeped the hell out of me. 

I was starting to get scared. It was raining, my parents weren't home yet, and I'm starting to see things. Just like in the movies, I ignored it, Just Kidding, I started to get a little panicked. I run downstairs to my kitchen because my hunger was drawing me there. I remembered we had hot dogs. I heated one up and put one on a bun. I don't know how you eat hot dogs, but I don't put mustard or ketchup on my hot dogs. I like to put hot sauce and pepper flakes. Anyways I bring my hot dogs(I made a couple) on my plate and I go to sit at the kitchen table. I like to watch videos on my tablet, so I put on some headphones, plugged them in, and I watched my tablet as I eat. 

As I was watching, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something dash away. I quickly looked but I saw nothing. I usually sit on the chair of the kitchen table that was farthest to the kitchen door that led outside. The chair faced away from the door. And the blinds that covered the kitchen door had a semi-big tear so that someone could stalk me from the outside and I wouldn't know. That thought scared me, so I sat at a different seat. Every so often, I would glance up to make sure that no one was peering in through that opening. As I finished up eating, I went to my kitchen sink and washed my plate. I glanced back at the little opening for one last look(yah I think I was paranoid now) and I saw something. More like a face. I almost dropped my plate. 

(Edited) HERE IS PART 2: Well, welcome back to part 2. 

Let's get back to where we last left off. First of all, thx for tuning back in, I appreciate it. Now onwards with the story: We have a motion sensored light outside my house, and my house is fitted with an alarm system because my neigborhood isn't that great. The motion sensored light was just turned on after I saw the person standing outside. I started to freak out and I quickly washed my plate. I quickly started to think that I was in danger. I started to think back to the figure I saw earlier in the indie. Maybe "it" was stalking me. I quickly grabbed my phone and called my parents. In a rush, I told them that I may have seen someone outside the house. My parents started to sound distressed. They quickly told me   to get to a safe place in the house because they were rushing back to the house just as I called. I asked them, "why are you guys rushing back before I called?" My parents told me to stay calm, because there were some disturbing news on the news channel. The news people said that there was a storm out, (that explained why it was raining) but not only that... they said that prior to the storm, there was a watch for a lost, uncontrolled individual who escaped from a mental prison. He had previously escaped the security premises, and could be found anywhere, at anytime. 

They said he was wearing mostly dark clothes and could be around these counties: my parents told me a list of neighborhoods especially the name of my area in that list. I think I was having a panic attack or something but I couldn't think straight. My hands and my whole body started to tremble as I heard the news. I had a thousand questions running through my head. Was the dark figure I saw the crazy guy on the news? I started running around my house making sure everything was locked. I grabbed my electronics, and I ran upstairs to my room. I quickly grabbed the remote that tells my alarm to ring in case the crazy guy outside decides to come in. I waited silently. I tried not to make noise. I tried not to lose my courage. I kept telling myself: I ain't going to die tonight. It was started to hail a little bit outside just to make it worse. Then I heard the noises again, this time it was coming from downstairs. It was like as if something was trying to tear the outside of my house down. It kept getting louder and louder until I heard a loud crash.

There were sounds coming from all directions. It was like moaning or screaming mixed in with the sounds of the hail. I started to pray. After a few minutes, everything became silent. I waited anxiously. As I was starting to calm down, the sound of my alarm going off sent shivers through my whole body. I think the person downstairs destroyed my alarm. i heard footsteps running around downstairs. I didn't think twice, I hit the panic button on my alarm remote hoping that would do something. Miraculously, the alarm sent the entire house in loud noise!
I heard the footsteps run towards the stairs and then back towards the kitchen area. It was like hard boots on the wooden floor. After a few minutes, I never heard them again. A few moments later, I could hear the sound of cars coming in the direction of my house. It was my parents who had arrived. Behind them the police arrived. I heard their voices calling out my name and I ran downstairs as fast a I could. Dang, I was so glad to see them!

The police came in and inspected the house as well. I looked at what had happened too. The kitchen table had been flipped to its side, the kitchen door was wide open because its hinges were destroyed, there were plates broken on the floor, and everything was a mess. I thought to myself, if I had been in that kitchen longer than when I had actually been in there, I probably wouldn't be alive today. I explained everything to my parents and the authorities. They couldn't believe it at all. I was just glad that I had survived this madness. To this day, I still don't know why the maniac targeted my house out of all the other houses. The days that followed, I was paranoid. I made sure that everything was safe when I went to sleep. I made sure that everything was locked when I went to bed. I still see glimpses of something that dashes away every time i look at it in the middle of the night. It happens mostly at my bedroom door. I don't know for sure, but I think the maniac that attacked my house hasn't been caught either. </TEXT>
