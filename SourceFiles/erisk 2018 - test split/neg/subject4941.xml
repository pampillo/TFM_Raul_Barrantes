/u/nicalsilva might have more info about this as well. The long and short of it is that webrender isn't fully implemented in nightly and AFAIK the actual rendering is still done in Gecko. 

I'm pretty sure the target for Webrender (and Stylo) is Firefox is 57 (could definitely be wrong on that though). </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's so many things wrong with this.

International wars have started over soccer in Latin America

For example?

ultras of teams defend them even with blood to the death

The most extreme of the extreme do, I suppose. The overwhelming majority  of *all* football games (in Europe at least) go on without incident.

hell Lazio is basically a fascist team.

Emm what? Why? Lazio was founded before fascism was even a thing. When fascists did come to power they wanted to merge the teams in Rome into 1 team, hence the founding of AS Roma, Lazio opposed this obviously. If some fascists support a particular team *now* there isn't much the club can do about it except ban them from the ground.

Real Madrid was the fascist dictator's favorite team

Vastly overstated. Franco wanted to politicise football domestically and internationally so Madrid were the obvious pick for that because of how successful they were, could've been any team really.

while people in Barcelona used the team as a way to express their culture.

This is right and they still do I suppose.

It lends people to follow a crest and indoctrinate and follow blindly, specially as long as your rival pays the price (vs. Roma; vs. Barcelona).

The amount of people like this is negligibly small. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the last few weeks (and especially because of the recent chemical attack) I've noticed that the community here is basically split in 2. The discussion in posts about basically politics e.g Trump said this, Putin said that, US / Russia mistakenly bombed some innocents the discussion is exactly as you describe, bottom of the barrel shit, conspiracy theories, non-sensical ideas etc. Then when you go into a post about something like SAA advancing in Palmyra, even rebels advancing somewhere the comments are completely different like totally level headed and dare I say even *neutral*. 

I've had the feeling that a lot of the commenters you're on about are /r/conspiracy, /r/the_donald types who've moved here for some reason and yesterday or the day before I decided to put it to the test. The post was about (I think) an anonymous US official saying the US had proof the SAA was responsible for the chemical attack and a huge amount of the comments were basically the US and MSM can't be trusted, but the worst comments were like how Russian media is more believable than western or Putin doesn't lie (these were real comments), I looked the posters up on snoopsnoo and to the shock of no-one the vast, overwhelming majority of these posters comments were in either /r/conspiracy or /r/the_donald and a few were both. 

It's my opinion either these people should be banned for life or a new sub called something like /r/true_syriancivalwar where the only allowed posts are directly related to the war, like current battles, advances etc and posts that are nothing more than a link to Trump's twitter account should be banned. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is what I've been saying and (based on no evidence, admittedly) the most likely scenario in my opinion. If the commander of the airbase decided for himself to carry out this attack without Assad's approval what's he going to do about it? Send the Tiger Forces after him? The Desert Hawks? Republican Guard?

Having people think Assad is in full control of the army is better than thinking he has no control because with no control there's nothing stopping more chemical weapon attacks which would be a very good way to get invaded by the US. </TEXT>

People every where keep throwing around this name like he's some sort of omnipotent, omnipresent being. Is it not possible that Assad has *a lot* less control over large parts of his army than people think and this was an act from some higher up in the army who decided "Fuck this town"? If the thought of this Chemical Weapon attack worked it's way up the chain of command all the way to Assad to sign off on like a nuclear strike would through the US or Russian chain of command and he said no would he be listened to? What could he do if they didn't listen? </TEXT>

They need cloud storage like pretty much everyone and from what I've seen (not from far right blogs or conspiracy sites) it needs to be custom made to be even more secure, so AWS seems like a no brainer since they're the best in the business. IBM was also in the running for this contract are they in bed with the CIA as well? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Criticizing Le Pen, the leader of the National Front who wants to leave the euro, hold a referendum on European Union membership and curb immigration, Macron said: "Nationalism is war. I know it. I come from a region that is full of graveyards."

The centrist, who voiced his strong pro-European views, comes from the Somme region, a major battlefield in World War One.

Le Pen hit back at Macron: "You shouldn't pretend to be something new when you are speaking like old fossils that are at least 50 years old."

Macron retorted: "Sorry to tell you this, Madame Le Pen, but you are saying the same lies that we've heard from your father for 40 years."

<TEXT> This is a comment I saved from years ago:

Lasers operate specifically by achieving negative Kelvin temperatures. This is because they are not in equilibrium (due to population inversion), so the dynamics start to get a little odd. Also, negative Kelvin temperatures are hotter than infinite positive Kelvin, though the scale goes backwards with negative infinity Kelvin being just slightly hotter than infinite Kelvin. Source: Two physical science degrees and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_temperature

Edit: Further description and answers for many confused people.

Rightfully so, many of you are confused at the notion that we could achieve a negative temperature, since absolute zero is the absence of movement, right?. In fact, negative temperature arises from the fact that temperature is not exactly defined in terms of physical motion. Rather, we define temperature as the change in reversible heat per the change in entropy. In a laser, we pump particles to excited states faster than they can decay to lower energy states. This means that an increase in energy actually decreases entropy. This is analogous to boiling water and having it freeze. Since the change in heat is positive and the change in entropy is negative, the next temperature is less than zero.

As a side note, absolute zero is actually not the absence of motion. Rather, it is the absence of entropy. At the lowest possible energy we still see movement because of quantum vacuum fluctuations (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_fluctuations). Yes, even when we are as cold and motionless as possible, the universe still pumps out particle-antiparticle pairs that annihilate too fast to be observed. Don't believe me?

<TEXT>  If it ain't broke don't fix it.

Is this not the main reason people advocate using Rust though? That there's inherent problems with C that just don't exist in Rust. [This comment chain from /r/Programming is mainly what I'm talking about](https://np.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/61rh9j/curl_is_c/dfgqkkq/) 

22 CVE's issued against curl in the past 12 months. Out of those 22, 10 are clearly to blame on C/C++ manual memory management model. So the quote

Of course that leaves a share of problems that couldve been avoided if we used another language. Buffer overflows, double frees and out of boundary reads etc, but the bulk of our security problems has not happened due to curl being written in C.

Is true.

But... the cURL project was started in 1997. They're still triaging memory safety issues 20 years later. Working in arguably the most conservative C standard to ease complexity.

How does any other project plan on doing better?

The other thing is that Rust isn't just about memory safety. Rust is about better programming using the lessons learned between 1978 and 2015. Some of those lessons are "C strings were a bad idea" and "manual calls to free() were a bad idea", but that's far from all of them. (I actually count 13 vulnerabilities of the last 2242, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 57, 58, 60, and 61directly related to those flaws.) But Rust has a better type system, both in terms of the ability to define custom types and the ability to track things with those types, safe enums (instead of C-style unions) and an excellent match construct, public and private types/functions, traits, and many other things.

For instance, the patch for CVE-2016-5420, "Incorrect reuse of client certificates", is about making sure that when you compare two structs, you don't forget to compare a field in the two structs. In C, you have to open-code this comparison. In Rust, you just stick #[deriving(Eq)] before the struct, because unlike C, Rust knows that comparison of structs is a thing that people might want to do ever. The compiler will generate a trait Eq implementation that compares all the fields, using the Eq implementations (either automatically-derived or manual) of each field, so you even get secure string compares if you define some SecureBuffer type and use it for the strings. (As a bonus, doing that also makes sure that you don't accidentally use a normal strcmp on the strings.) When you add a new field to the struct, the automatic Eq implementation on the struct will automatically compare it, too.

And in fact, the current version of the comparison function doesn't check all the members of the struct, and there's no comment why. Is that a vulnerability? I have no idea! I assume not, because they would have noticed when patching CVE-2016-5420, but without a comment, who knows for sure?

<TEXT> It's probably the worst Barcelona midfield in a decade, one of the biggest complaints Barca fans have against Enrique is the state of the midfield. They didn't even have to press around Barca's box like the first leg just the midfield, put them under some kind of pressure and it would have completely thrown them off, instead they got free reign completely to do what they wanted with the ball, I couldn't believe what I was watching in the first half. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They pressed Barcelona around Barca's own box the first leg and put 4 past them so obviously the best plan of action for the second leg is to surrender Barca's third, surrender the midfield and defend around their own box giving Barcelona of all teams complete control of the ball. It's criminal tactics, absolutely no excuse for it. When Di Maria finally came on and they finally started pressing like the last game they had a goal in less than 10 minutes.

Even considering all that most of the goals were down to PSG's own mistakes rather than Barca brilliance.

<TEXT> What an absolutely, outrageous comment. Do you honestly think that people can't *constructively* criticize something unless they have a superior, alternative way of doing it? Is no one allowed to criticize certain things about a car unless they can design a better car? Can no one criticize aspects of a house unless they can design a better house?

The original comment is a perfectly legitimate criticism (among a litany of others) maybe instead of making snarky comments you make a reasonable counter point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to assume you're a complete beginner like I was. 

I've done more tasks with Servo so I'm going to be biased towards that (although imho Servo is a bit more accessible to complete beginners without any opensource experience or even git experience like me)

You can make a comment here saying you're looking for a task and say what (if any) experience you have. https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/15162

Then if you get a task go here [Github-workflow](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Github-workflow) and follow the instructions and also [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20956154/whats-the-workflow-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-using-git-pull-reque/20956155#20956155) stackoverflow answer is *extremely* helpful, I wish I found it when I started out.

That's about it tbh. Nearly the hardest thing is finding a task because the easy ones get taken pretty quick :-). Contributing to the Rust project is basically the same but AFAIK there's no equivalent to the github workflow so you'll be going back and forth to the Servo project to the workflow which is one reason why I just stayed with Servo and I don't think there's a place to comment if you want to put you're name down for a task either. Each [This week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/) blog post has a section for tasks up for grabs though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was under a different name but essentially the same bank. It was renamed CIT Bank (who started the proceedings) after a merger and Mnuchin is still on the board. So technically wrong I suppose? Not sure why CNN should retract they're story since they weren't wrong and Politico and Huffington Post corrected their article to reflect the truth so not sure why they should either. 

This was fake news. 

. . .

Fake news has been defined as news which is "completely made up and designed to deceive readers to maximize traffic and profit"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news#Definition

<TEXT> From CNN:

The bank even **started** one foreclosure over an unpaid bill for 27 cents, according to allegations raised by surviving partners, their relatives and advisers.

So they never ever actually said it was foreclosed just foreclosure proceedings had started over it.

Politico posted a correction

CORRECTION: This story has been corrected to reflect that CIT Bank, successor to OneWest after a 2015 merger, was the entity that filed foreclosure proceedings against Ossie Lofton over a 27-cent payment error. The story has also been revised to clarify that there were two separate foreclosure proceedings against Lofton. At the time the second foreclosure was filed in 2016, Mnuchin had sold his stake in OneWest and was on the board of CIT.

So did the HuffingtonPost 

CORRECTION: This article previously misstated that OneWest had successfully closed on Loftons home. The bank dropped its suit, and is now being countersued. Language has also been amended to reflect that the banks suit was predicated on a shortfall related to an insurance fee, and not a mortgage payment.

So 2 were wrong but corrected themselves and CNN was right. These hardly qualify as fake stories? </TEXT>

<TEXT> /r/the_donald types do and believe whatever Trump says and if he says Republicans in Congress and the Senate are the enemy that means they're the enemy. I think they'll probably vote for white supremacist types that are promoted by Breitbart or infowars or whatever. Trump voters that haven't gone off the deep end will probably just stay at home or maybe vote Democrat (depending on the candidate). </TEXT>

...

Whats going on was explained lucidly by a senior Pentagon intelligence official, who stated that since January 20, weve assumed that the Kremlin has ears inside the SITROOM, meaning the White House Situation Room, the 5,500 square-foot conference room in the West Wing where the president and his top staffers get intelligence briefings. Theres not much the Russians dont know at this point, the official added in wry frustration.

<TEXT>  It's not like the the "paper trail" is conducted for tracking purposes or anything.

You sure? If you have a list of thousands of people you want "disappeared" it'd probably be a good idea to keep track of who actually was killed and who wasn't. If a higher up asks if random terrorist sympathizer Ahmed from Homs was actually killed a paper trail like a sham trial or sham autopsy would probably be needed. It's  not exactly unheard of either the nazis kept very meticulous records in the concentration camps. </TEXT>

China only recently(ish) overtook the US's pollution levels in absolute terms with about 3 times the population and per capita is still about 1/3rd of US. 

especially after how big in Green the US was and trying to be

The US was never big on green and it was never looking that way either, the US was putting in place policies that were in place in other countries for over a decade.

<TEXT> So I actually decided to look at the other parties pages and I was a bit surprised. First of all none of the main parties; Labour, Fianna Fail, Fine Gael have more than 25,000 likes, Sinn Fein has 120,000. The other parties have no meme presence that I could see. Maybe it was just me but I didn't see any criticism in any of the comments on Sinn Fein's posts but it seemed like every other party had people criticising the party on every post. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From someone else on this. . .

I love it when someone cites this article, because it's so easy to utterly destroy.

If we're looking for appeal to authority, Dr. McHugh is contradicting the [official position of the APA](http://www.apa.org/about/policy/transgender.aspx) on the subject. But better yet, we're talking about the kind of man who - after being appointed to the Catholic review board to deal with priests abusing kids in the Church - characterizes it as not a pedophilia issue but rather, and I quote, ["homosexual predation on American Catholic youth"](http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/adopting_chaos).

As for the study he cites, he's referring to to [this Swedish study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885) from a few years back. He is correct in noting that post-transition trans people had elevated mortality and suicide rates...but only if they transitioned before 1989 and only compared to the general population (and not to pre-transition trans folks). In fact, they specifically note that there is no such difference for the post-1989 cohort, and other studies demonstrate decreases in suicidality relative to pre-transition folks - both facts that Dr. McHugh conveniently ignores. The study's conclusion specifically notes:

Our findings suggest that sex reassignment, although alleviating gender dysphoria, may not suffice as treatment for transsexualism, and should inspire improved psychiatric and somatic care after sex reassignment for this patient group.

They're calling for more help, not for less.

So here we have someone with a very clear pre-existing religiously-motivated agenda citing studies to argue against their conclusions and cherry-picking the data convenient for him.

Pretty much all encryption methods today use 1 of these. If he's created a totally new method for encrypting data then I suppose it's possible it's immune to Quantum computers. Without extensive and *extremely* thorough vetting no one is going to be using it and when vetting does occur I'm going to guess that's the last we'll hear of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did you even read the article? It clearly states why they're being investigated and the accusations aren't "vague" they're very clear.

Le Pen is accused of breaking the Parliaments rules by having two assistants  Thierry Lgier and Catherine Griset  carry out non-parliamentary work while being paid by the EU institution.

Why would the EU pay her assistants to carry out work that has nothing to with the European parliament? It's hardly without precedent either since her own fucking father and founder of the party was ordered to repay money last year.

The financial penalties against Le Pen echo those imposed on her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen. The former chief of the National Front, who is also an MEP, was in June accused of misusing resources and ordered to repay 320,000.

<TEXT> Not lack of interest it's just Rust is a very young language so a lot needs to be done but only so much can be done at the one time. This is a comment on debugging from the [Roadmap for 2017](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1774). 

The work we're planning for 2017 on IDEs does not really touch on debugging, more on the editing facilities like jump to definition, refactoring, or displaying errors as you type. Debugging in IDEs needs two things - better integration between the IDE and a debugger (as you suggest, this is purely down to IDE integration) and better handling of Rust code by debuggers (this is happening slowly, both in the Rust compiler and in debuggers such as GDB, but, although we agree it is important, is not likely to be a focus in 2017).

For Intellij [this is the open debugging issue](https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/issues/535). Apparently there is ways of debugging Rust (in particular in Eclipse) but if you're looking for the same debugging experience you'd get with Java in Intellij or Eclipse I'm afraid you're not going to find it yet :-/ </TEXT>

You need to try C# with Visual Studio + ReSharper Ultimate, if it wasn't for Visual Studio crashing once every week or 2 it'd be the ultimate (heh) experience.

Can't comment on Racer because I can't even get it to work but the Rust Plugin for Intellij is getting very good. Goto and autocompletion work very and if you use something in a crate that you don't have a `use` for it'll ask if you want to `use` it. It's still in a state of rapid but it gets better every time. The only (very) big problem is that there's no debug support.

In 1930, Hitler said: "Our adopted term 'Socialist' has nothing to do with Marxist Socialism. Marxism is anti-property; true Socialism is not."[202] In 1942, Hitler privately said: "I absolutely insist on protecting private property ... we must encourage private initiative" </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you post a comment in /r/LateStageCapitalism with the words "crazy" or "insane" the automod will auto delete it.

Edit: A few people are making test comments with the word crazy over there to see if it's true (maybe because they don't believe me?). . .so I'll save anyone else the trouble and post the message I got back when I originally made the comment and inquired about it.

We have comrades with mental illness; using "crazy" or "insane" when we mean to say something is evil, ridiculous, sad, wrong, etc, helps place even more stigma on them than they're already living with. So the automoderator screens out "crazy". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Russia has major problems with hooligans, just look up 'Russian hooligans at Euro 2016'. A lot specifically train in gyms to go fighting at games, probably the worst example at the Euros they showed up with gum shields and ufc gloves and starting attacking random people at the end of the game. [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW6YScsDhOo) that *kinda* shows that example, I watched it live and it was a lot worse than what's shown here.

The Russian minister for sport actually did condemn it...A higher up in the Russian football Union not so much.

 I dont see anything wrong with the fans fighting. Quite the opposite, well done lads, keep it up!

I dont understand those politicians and officials who are criticising our fans. We should defend them, and then we can sort it out when they come home.

<TEXT> With how often I bring it up on this sub I'm starting to sound like a bit of an evangelist, but have you tried Intellij with the Rust plugin? There's no configuration involved you just download it from the plugin menu of the IDE and it installs by itself, updates are every week or 2 and they make it noticeably better every time. It's not up the same level as Java + Intellij but it's getting there. Biggest con is there's no debugging :-/, not a *huge* issue for me but still annoying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Be wary of HP envys, I have [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/HP-ENVY-15-AE058na-15-6-Laptop/dp/B019H4N8G2). it happened a couple of times before where the mouse would go crazy completely. It would fly all over the screen right/left clicking by itself but went away after a minute or 2. This morning though it was particularly bad and when I eventually managed to turn it off I instead decided to boot up windows 10 and to my shock the exact same thing was happening. So I said to myself this is strange that a problem would persist over the 2 OSs so I did some investigation (on my phone because the mouse was so unusable). It turns out this is a major issue spanning years and 35 pages over here http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Operating-System-and-Recovery/hp-control-zone-trackpad-incredibly-glitchy/td-p/4073164.

Havn't tried yet but apparently reinstalling drivers does nothing, hard reset does nothing, the solution (apparently, on page 31) is to disassemble the laptop and take out the screws holding the trackpad and put them back in because the screws are in too tight. It isn't actually much of a problem for me because I always use an actual mouse so my solution now has been to turn off the trackpad. </TEXT>

Nope your wrong. One of Reddits favourite hobbies is to fellate Todd Howard without end. Just look at /r/gaming or even /r/gamingcirclejerk, its a jerk of only pro Fallout 4 posts and Bethesda apologism. There are only a handful of intelligent people who are seeing through these lies, but I'm one of them, and I'm here. So yeah. The little hate there is for F4 is deserved, since Bethesda scammed us with a fake RPG product. It's a open world shooter with RPG elements, and it needs to be heard otherwise TES VI will just end up the same.

`To use a custom webrender with servo, go to your servo build directory and:`

    Edit servo/Cargo.toml
    Add at the end of the file:

`[replace]
"webrender:0.11.0" = { path = 'Path/To/webrender/webrender/' }
"webrender_traits:0.11.0" = { path = 'Path/To/webrender/webrender_traits' }`

    Build as normal

Do I have to build all of Servo or can I just do `Go to the servo directory and do ./mach update-cargo -p webrender` (from the top of the README.md as well) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have put in 100 hours in Fallout 4, and i can just say that it's bland. Even tho Skyrim was blander than it's predecessor it's still a remarkably good game, especially because the modding community. Fallout 4 just a step down, it's a remarkable mediocre game. I spent most of my time looking for a replayability that just wasnt there.

...

The 100hrs could've been trying to see if the content was as shallow as it felt but the no replayability comes from for the most part outside of which faction you choose at the end there aren't many big decisions you make that warrant doing the same kinda stale content again.

...

I have 70 hours in Fallout 4 and have nothing but disappointment to show for it. Those 70 hours are basically a product of hoping against hope it's going to get good at some point. I've played through 3 probably 4 times, same with NV. I've tried picking up 4 again and got two hours in before giving up. It's just a horrible RPG and not a very good shooter.

...

150 hours, the only thing that really pushed me was to see every location in the game so I could gauge how much genuine entertainment I could find in the game, that and I already spent 60 fucking dollars on something that was basically soul crushing to me so I might as well get my money's worth out of it. 

All the same comment chain. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Off topic, but is there any need for such enormous signatures?

`fn flat_mapU, F(self, f: F) - FlatMapSelf, U, F where F: FnMut(Self::Item) - U, U: IntoIterator`

I don't know about anyone else, but this just makes my eyes glaze over before I even have a chance to read the example. Like in the Java docs the signature is way more simplified and easier to skim over.

`public int size()`

Simple. Then you have an explanation then at the bottom where it's specified (if you care about). It just seems like a complete overload of information in Rust especially for a beginner or even an intermediate level Rust programmer. </TEXT>

"Migrant" is a racist word because countries and nationalities exist. Ok, got it.

 OP: Severely doubt you have even a bit of it.

Other dude: Please, explain how countries existing, and people wanting to control their borders is a "core tenet of fascist monologue." If you can climb off that high horse, that is.

OP: Look, you clearly don't have a brain, so there'd be no point explaining to you. Go and read some history if you want to try and educate yourself. Even Wikipedia could probably enlighten you to an extent. But it's completely pointless if you're not willing to even consider alternatives, and have no capacity to think critically about the subject. You should probably just stick to the medicine, you might be able to cure yourself of being braindead one day.

<TEXT> Apparently the word migrant is intrinsicly racist, so you can't use it

Sally is correct in stating that the problem is one of language and syntax.
The use of the term 'migrant' necessarily implies that some people have a 'right' to live in certain countries or parts of the world, whilst other people do not, based on the acceptance of mis-guided conceptions of nationality structured on 19th and 20th century fascist and absolutist rhetoric.

At it's core, the term 'migrant' is intrinsically racist, carrying with it the major connotation of impermanence or temporariness that implies that 'these people' will at some point 'go back to where they came from' as they are not 'natural' citizens of the area they have moved to.

The idea that some people have a natural right to live somewhere, whilst other people do not, is a core tenet of fascist monologue that should be challenged at all times and in all places, by refuting and deconstructing the ideology of nation-states.

What planet are these people from?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That just doesn't match with reality though. A weaker currency is good when you import little, the UK is the opposite. [UK trade deficit widens unexpectedly as exports fall despite pound drop](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/09/uk-trade-deficit-widens-september-exports-fall-pound-drop)

Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, said that a weaker currency was not necessarily a key driver of exports. If we are lucky, the weak pound may boost exports, but I would highlight that **export growth tends to be driven more by the strength of overseas demand, rather than the exchange rate.**

And the people may have voted for sovereignty, but that is absolutely not what they'll get. You've probably heard of the court case where British judges in British courts made a ruling on British law and what was the response by the leave campain? A 100,000 man march! 

[The march would be a reminder about what we voted for, so there is no slippage on the single market which we think this case was used to get a negotiating stand on," the spokesman said.(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/06/nigel-farage-to-lead-100000-strong-march-on-supreme-court-on-day/)

If you and the leave voters think this will finish with a net increase in Democracy you're sorely mistaken.

Of course there are substantial elements of both in Trumps voting base, but the two categories are inextricably linked: The more economic suffering people endure, the angrier and more bitter they get, the easier it is to direct their anger to scapegoats. Economic suffering often fuels ugly bigotry.

And some counties that voted Trump, voted Obama. From the article *again*

Low-income rural white voters in Pa. voted for Obama in 2008 and then Trump in 2016, and your explanation is white supremacy? Interesting.

<TEXT> I get your point and I think everyone else does as well, but the IRA is one of the worst examples you could've picked. For starters there was more than 1 IRA and the main group the Provisional IRA (PIRA) laid down their arms after the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) so it was completely peaceful and overall amicable. The GFA covered many, many things but basically the main goal of the IRA, a unified Ireland, will be accomplished by political means not violent. There is essentially no IRA of any kind around today except for minor irrelevant groups that have IRA in their name but they're nothing more than gangs. 

Sinn Fin, was the political wing of the PIRA and is the party of unification in Ireland and Northern Ireland, they are a lot of things and right wing is not one of them. They're the most left wing major party in the Ireland so probably communists by American standards lol.

Edit: The National Socialist Underground is a far right German group if you want a right wing example, I'm not German so I don't how relevant they are today though. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Some people are always going to break laws, we accept that we wont pander to some (child molesters, rapists, murders)

Do you really equate child rape to someone lighting a spliff or taking some MDMA? If you don't then you should delete the above part of your comment because it's ridiculous. Just because something is illegal doesn't make it morally wrong which is one of the main reason for legalisation. Everything you listed there is morally wrong no matter what way you look at it so they obviously shouldn't be legalised and no one is asking for them to be legalised anyway. 

Unless you want the government to start making these illegal drugs, that's just spending more money on these people

Very strange wording. "these people". . .what people? It's said in a way that would imply that the overwhelming majority of drug users are anything other than ordinary people in college or with jobs or whatever and yes I do think it should be up to the government to manufacture / grow the drugs. They can control exactly what goes into it and in what quantities. If I can go into a shop and buy a few grams of weed or MDMA and know exactly what I'm getting and for cheaper I'm not going to to some idiot hasn't the first clue what's in whatever he's selling. So the vast majority of any gangs income is now gone, never to come back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're putting forth reasons to keep drugs illicit and then in same comment you're disproving them. This. . .

People who have no where else to do it. Young people who live at home, homeless people with no save place. Never mind the kids who will spend years walking past these places, do you not think that gives them a sense that this is ok?

. . .is mostly solved by this. . .

It would be enough to send a guard around to a lot of schools. Teach kids the dangers of drugs.

I don't know how up to do you are with the legalisation movement but education is one of the most important parts of it and to me is just as important as the act of legalisation itself. Why send a guard around to schools though? the only thing they can comment on with certainty is the after effects of drug abuse the way things are currently such as a heroin addiction quickly leading to a life of crime. Why not send a medical professional who is qualified to teach people about what exactly each of the most used drugs does to your body? They could explain what heroin does to a person, why it's so dangerous, why it's so addicting etc. If people know exactly the dangers are they won't do it.

The way things are is what you're advocating. At the minute the height of drug education is "Don't do it" and then the endless propaganda (yes it is propaganda) in newspapers but people are always going to do try one or some illegal drugs and when they do they've realised that they've been lied to all their lives. Weed doesn't give you brain damage, it doesn't damage your lungs as bad as cigarettes, MDMA isn't (physically) addicting, it doesn't put holes in your brain etc. So when 1 lie is discovered the whole thing collapses. The only thing that'll solve this is actual education from someone who doesn't espouse non-sense or has an agenda and we'll have to come to terms with the fact that people are always going to do drugs so why not let them do it in the safest way possible? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I think the law stops a lot of people doing drugs. If the threat of the law was great enough, more people would avoid drugs to begin with.

This opinion is extremely common and extremely untrue. It can be demonstrated as untrue by looking to other countries and see how they handle the situation. Currently in the Philippines you can be killed on sight if you're suspected of being a drug dealer, 100s are already dead possibly thousands and even at that it still isn't going to completely eliminate drugs, is this a situation you'd like to see in Ireland where instead of the streets of Dublin being filled with needles it's filled with the blood of dealers?

Before you say the Philippines is a third world country or whatever, we'll look at the United States which literally declared war on drugs. Minor offenses like possession of an innocuous drug like weed can lead to years in prison. Cocaine, heroin etc can be a decade or longer, no knock raids are common on dealers houses, the Patriot act is used multitudes of times more for dealers than terrorists and there's still cities with epidemics that are stuff the nightmares for people in this country. Is this more a long the lines of what you'd like to see? </TEXT>

This thread is about heroin but these comments seem to be about drugs in general so I don't know, are you saying heroin abuse will eventually kill them or are you saying other drugs (party drugs, for lack of a better word and because they're the most common illegal drugs) will also lead to abuse and death? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This encourages drug use.

This is a myth and nothing more. What extra people does this encourage to do heroin? Is it people already at risk that you think this will encourage, like people who are homeless, chronically unemployed, struggling with mental health issues etc etc because the people in these brackets that are already spending most of their time on the streets have obstruction to heroin because of it's availability.

Or do you think it's people that aren't currently at risk, people with steady jobs, a family or maybe younger people in college? 

The money would be better spent on policing.

How much should be spent on policing exactly?, because I find it hard to believe this is going to cost more than a few hundred thousand or maybe a couple of million. If that money was diverted to the police it wouldn't but a guard on every street corner and every alley way. It wouldn't be enough to bolster customs to such an extent that they catch all the heroin coming into the country because that it literally impossible.  </TEXT>

Hendry still has more Masters, World Championships and UK Championships and ranking titles over all and any record that's broken these days is almost certain to be Hendry's like most centuries that Ronnie broke a year or 2 ago. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  So corporations are benefiting from our nation's infrastructure and national stability

Apple does pay tax in the US, enormous amounts. What they're avoiding is this

The hard fact is that the US tax code incentivizes tax haven abuse by allowing companies to indefinitely defer **taxes on offshore profits** until they are repatriated.

For some reason the US government (the only government) thinks Apple should pay taxes on sales outside the US so when Apple sells an iPhone in Germany assembled in China with materials sourced from the four corners of the world with no connection to the US, the US government still thinks it deserves a piece of Apple's profit. There's obviously other ways these companies avoid paying taxes but Apple was singled out and this is a big reason why they have such huge offshore cash reserves.

<TEXT> **f**(x) = **f**unction of x, hardly random and when f is taken g is the letter next to it and for x and y here's an answer from quora...

The reason that x was first chosen to be the unknown variable in  algebraic equations is that the Arabic word for "thing" was translated  into the Spanish as "xei."  The first  algebra equations were written by Arabic speakers with the unknown being  labeled "thing" (much like some pre-algebra books today just use a  question mark).  After the Spanish adopted algebra the Arabic "thing"  was written "xei" and eventually shortened to just x.


Source: Michael Lamar's answer to Why are functions f(x) and not f(y)?

The primary underpinnings of modern algebra were born in Arabia during the Islamic civilization. In these times, the common word for a "thing" was "shei". This was used in books on calculations as part of equations. For instances, "four things equal 20", which is just 4x=20. "Shei" transferred to Greek as Xei, because it was tough to pronounce the "sh" sound, and thus it got replaced by 

which got shortened / changed to x.


Source: Himanish Ganjoo's answer to Mathematics: Why is the unknown parameter mostly taken as "x"? Does it possibly have any origins?
Lastly, do note that the letter y comes right after the letter x in (all?) alphabets derived from the Roman one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not OP but I'm in almost the exact same position. I've used Rust on and off for a few years now and I'm going to have to pick a project for my final year in college as well, the difference is I hardly even considered Rust. 

There is literally no advantage for me to use it. *If* I picked Rust (and I really would love to) the project would either be an embedded project (micro controller) or maybe a server type project running on a raspberry Pi. The documentation to do either would be poor to say the least and the ways of doing each in Rust seem to be still in a high state of flux. Not to mention none of my lecturers know Rust.

Also like OP now I'm thinking of doing a project in the .Net framework now. None of my lecturers know C# or have anything to do with .Net (it's either Java in eclipse or C), but I just finished a 6 month placement in a .Net house and Visual Studio + ReSharper Ultimate just makes everything so much easier and the benefits of the tooling far outweigh the negatives of none of my lecturers knowing .Net. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Part of this is the availability of tools, particularly for Windows. A debugger is very useful, and Visual Studio's debugger is pretty decent. I know gdb works with Rust, but that's more a Linux thing, and i don't have a linux machine right now.

Not sure if you forgot to leave it out or not but you didn't mention ReSharper. Visual Studio is frankly (and with no offence) out of sight of anything Rust has. . .Visual Studio + ReSharper Ultimate you'd need the Hubble telescope to see how far in front it is.  </TEXT>

That definitely destroys a habitat though. . .and one of the main reasons people say we shouldn't build a nuclear plant is because there's a chance it might destroy a habitat (an almost negligible chance in this day and age)

Edit: Also this

 And the tech is getting better every year now that people are actually bothered about it.

We can't wait a few years and we can't afford to bet on the future the likes of Moneypoint should've been closed down by now if there's any chance of us meeting our green house gas reduction targets. And if we are going to bet on future technology why not bet on Gen IV nuclear reactors? Passively safe, massively reduced amount of waste and amount of long term dangerous waste, more efficient, broader range of fuels to choose from.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> EconomyGerman trade surplus swells to fresh record

Germanys bloated current account has long been the fodder for the countrys economic critics.

Well, some some more fuel arrived today. Germanys balance in goods, services and payments with the rest of the world  known as its current account  has now grown to a record 30.4bn in March, its highest monthly reading to date, writes Mehreen Khan.

Measured on a quarterly basis, the current account swelled to 65.7bn in the first three months of the year, according to the countrys statistics office.

Europes exporting powerhouse also saw its trade surplus hit a record 20.6bn in March, as it managed to sell goods worth 107bn compared to imports of 80.9bn.

Germany exported 62.6bn worth of goods to the European Union, and imported products to the value of 53.9bn from the bloc.

On the one hand, thats a good sign that foreign demand has picked up despite jitters about a slowdown in global growth.

But only yesterday, the International Monetary Fund issued another warning about the size of Germanys dominant trade position with the rest of the world, arguing the country should use its considerable fiscal space to fund infrastructure rather than racking up bumper savings.

Mario Draghi has also hit out at the state of Germanys sizeable trade surplus, arguing that it has helped push down interest rates in the eurozone.

**Germany has also long fallen foul of EU budget rules which limit member states to running current account surpluses of no more than 6 per cent of GDP. The current account is set to hit 8.5 per cent this year, compared to 8.8 per cent in 2015, according to the European Commission.**

<TEXT> IDE support is literally the only keeping me from diving into rust more. It's happened a few times now contributing to the compiler where I'd run the command to build and run the tests only to have it fail to compile after an hour or hour and a half (my laptop is slow very slow) because of a simple thing like leaving out an ` ` before a variable but if I was using an IDE like Visual Studio it'd be picked in an instant. Even with small programs that only take a second or 2 to compile it's still very irritating because every time you compile there could be another little error that is only picked up after a compile failure. It's only after trying to program in rust have I come to appreciate all those little red underscores when programming in C# in Visual Studio.

The compiler support there is now for the like Visual Studio Code also isn't incredibly useful, I'm using RustyCode which does help but Racer seems to spend more time crashing than working and for beginner like me there was an awful lot of overhead just to get it up and running (if it even is set up right, I'm not really sure) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Hopefully AMD can light a fire under them again.

I've seen this said countless times on this sub and other places around I just don't understand what people are expecting. Silicon is dying, like we are at the very end of pure silicon cpus, it isn't possible to get massive gains out cpus anymore all the low, medium and most of the high hanging fruit has been picked, there is nothing left. 

Even if AMD does knock it out of the park and even matches Intel's CannonLake in every way it still won't make much of a difference in the grand scheme of things because that could very well be the final pure silicon cpu AMD releases and Intel is in a much better position to design, manufacture and release a post silicon cpu. It was posted here a few days ago how Intel have made a massive Photonics breakthrough which shows they are once again on the cutting edge of cpu design and thinking in terms of the future not present like AMD. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll never understand the mentality people have that Intel are somehow being willfully slow making progress and that they don't innovate anymore. Intel is fighting multiple wars on multiple fronts and is winning everywhere and people seriously think Intel is sitting on their laurels doing the absolute minimum to soak up inordinate amounts of money. Their only competitor in the desktop area is Amd and Amd's latest, boom or bust, possibly last hoorah cpu is estimated to be about 2 generations behind Intel at release just in terms of speed (not even comparing things like TDP, Branch prediction, how good the caches are etc etc all things that make a massive difference in the grand scheme of things). Then there's Intel's foundry advantage which is still ahead of TSMC, Global Foundries and Samsung, Samsung is way bigger than Intel and the other 2 are completely dedicated to the foundry business and still none can catch up to Intel.

<TEXT> Could you link the report because I can't find it, what I can find is the former minister for transport Leo Varadkar instructing the NRA to withdraw their application to An Bord Pleanla for the M20.

It followed the decision in 2011 by Mr Donohoes predecessor, Leo Varadkar, to instruct the NRA to withdraw its application to An Bord Pleanla for the M20 because the economic downturn meant capital funding for the estimated 720m cost of the project was unavailable.

...

The NRA had already spent 15m on the planning application for the M20.

<TEXT> You should be able to debate things without resorting to petty insults. 

CaisLaochach is everywhere in this thread questioning why we need to focus investment outside of Dublin even though he admitted in his own comment above that the other cities in Ireland are underdeveloped. They're as ignorant as they come.

Any who, the point of investing in Cork, Limerick and Galway is to increase traffic between them. There probably isn't the traffic to justify it *right now* that doesn't mean that with a motorway and the necessary investment in each city that there never will be. Also I see the Waterford motorway as more proof of centralised investment in Dublin, no major projects would get built unless Dublin was involved, a motorway from Cork to Waterford would've benefited both more than Dublin and Waterford are benefiting from their motorway now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There doesn't seem to be any original thought here tbh. I don't follow this sub too closely but it just seems to be the equal but opposite of whatever the racists and fascists of reddit say. In regards to the migrant crisis in Europe the feeling I get from this place is that all should be rescued and brought to European shores no real discussion of how to solve it or what to do once they land on the shores. 

Same with the economy at large, complaining that capitalism is ruining the world and creating inequality and saying that everything would be better if everything was state owned (or worker owned, whatever) isn't a solution. You actually need to provide answers on how to organise the economy, how you'll grow it, how you'll get people to start businesses that flourish etc. 

I really think there should be a new socialist movement that completely and totally breaks away from the past, because I think that's one of the main problems: Focusing on the likes of Lenin and Marx et al and what they thought. Those men lived and died so many years that their opinions on organising a modern, technological economy aren't valid. </TEXT>

**$3.4bn for its European Reassurance Initiative - up from $789m for the current budget year.**

$582.7bn is total budget for the military, about half of 1% of the US defence spending goes to Europe and that's *after* they quadrupled it so before that it was close 0.1% of the total budget. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That reminds of a story here in the ~~netherlands~~ world

Everywhere does that, boxing (especially), Muay Thai, Kick Boxing etc. It keeps them active and off the streets. If they're in a gym 3 or 4 nights a week training do you really think many of them will be robbing houses afterward or more inclined to join gangs? Not to mention a lot these children probably don't have any sort of father figure or even just a positive male influence which the coach can fill in: [Cus D'Amato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cus_D%27Amato) one of the most famous examples.

Not something like programming or photo/video editing.

How long do you think uneducated children would last doing something like that and why would they want to do it?  </TEXT>

Out of curiosity, I'd love to read on that topic, where did you find a study stating that an oppressive justice system causes generational deficits in communities, which in turn create higher rates of violent crime? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's worth reading the article and the background but if you couldn't be bothered then the reason he isn't being extradited is because there's a chance he'd end up in ADX Florence the supermax prison where there is 24 hour solitary confinement. In the words of the judge:

"I am satisfied," Donnelly said, "that prolonged exposure to involuntary solitary confinement exacts a significant physiological toll, is damaging to the integrity of the mind and personality, and is damaging to the bodily integrity of the person."

[You can keep him, please.](https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3gffnq/irish_high_court_refuses_to_extradite_suspect_to/ctxng7o)

<TEXT> Ok this is one of my first programs and as you probably guessed I'm having trouble. What the program is supposed to do is read in a word and a letter, it then finds the first instance of the letter in the word and prints out the position of letter in said word.

    use std::io;

    fn main()
    {
     let mut reader = io::stdin();

     print!("Enter a word: ");
     let word = reader.read_line().ok().expect("Failure");
 	
     print!("Enter a letter to find: ");
     let letter = reader.read_line().ok().expect("Failure");
 
     println!("");

     for (ii,xx) in word.as_slice().chars().enumerate() {
      if xx == letter {
       println!("First occurance of {} is at position {}", letter, ii);
       break;
      }
     } 
    }	

The problem i get is with the "if xx == letter..." 

    error: mismatched types: expected `char` but found `collections::string::String` (expected struct collections::string::String but found char)

After doing alot of reading in various places I've come to the conclusion that 

    let letter = reader.read_line().ok().expect("Failure");

gives me a string and going by the (somewhat confusing) error I need to somehow convert it to a char for the comparison above? </TEXT>

<TEXT> ~~Adolf Hitler~~ EA (German: [EA] ( listen); 20 April 1889  Present) was an Austrian-born German politician and the leader of the Nazi Party (German: Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP); National Socialist German Workers Party). He was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and dictator of Nazi Germany (as Fhrer und Reichskanzler) from 1934 to 1945. EA was at the centre of Nazi Germany, World War II in Europe, and the Holocaust.

EA was a decorated veteran of World War I. He joined the German Workers' Party (precursor of the NSDAP) in 1919, and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted a coup d'tat in Munich, known as the Beer Hall Putsch. The failed coup resulted in EA 's imprisonment, during which time he wrote his memoir, Mein Kampf (My Struggle). After his release in 1924, EA gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, antisemitism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. After his appointment as chancellor in 1933, he transformed the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich, a single-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of Nazism.

EA 's aim was to establish a New Order of absolute Nazi German hegemony in continental Europe. To this end, his foreign and domestic policies had the aim of seizing Lebensraum ("living space") for the Germanic people. He directed the rearmament of Germany and the invasion of Poland by the Wehrmacht in September 1939, resulting in the outbreak of World War II in Europe. Under EA 's rule, in 1941 German forces and their European allies occupied most of Europe and North Africa. In June 1941, EA ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. Although initially successful, the Russian campaign turned disastrous. By 1943, Germany was forced onto the defensive and suffered a series of escalating defeats. In the final days of the war, during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, EA married his long-time partner, Eva Braun. On 30 April 1945, less than two days later, the two committed suicide to avoid capture by the Red Army, and their corpses were burned.

EA 's aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. Under EA 's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews, and millions of other people whom he and his followers deemed racially inferior. </TEXT>
