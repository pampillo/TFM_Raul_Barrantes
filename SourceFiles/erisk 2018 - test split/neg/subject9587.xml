<TEXT> I'm still experimenting with the reverse sear too. In theory, the reverse sear method is suppose to have a similar effect to sous vide. Where the steak has a more even gradient throughout the meat as opposed to being rarer in the center. 

This picture shows the difference:

<TEXT> For the steak?
I actually baked it in the same cast that I'd later sear the steak. I made a bed with the onions and put the steak on top so it never touched any part of the cast iron during the bake.

The potatoes I lined a baking sheet with aluminum foil. I only had one baking sheet so I cooked the asparagus by just wrapping it in foil, usually I'd use a baking sheet as well though (and no cover). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mozzarella was the only cheese I had on hand and I figured it was close enough to queso fresco

For the recipe, I don't have exact measurements so you can add more/less of an ingredient you like/dislike

Ingredients
1 large tomato chopped
1/2-1 white onion chopped
1.5-2 cups of lime juice for cook
1/4 cups of lime or orange juice for taste (optional)
1/2-1 cup cilantro
Seasoning salt to taste
Mozzarella for topping (or queso fresco)
Fried tortilla
Cabbage sliced thinly for bedding (optional)
1 lb halibut cut into small bite sized pieces (or any other firm white meat fish like sea bass)

Steps
Soak/cook the halibut, onions and lime juice. Place in fridge for 20 minutes.
Cook time varies on preference. I used serious eats recommendation of 20 minutes. Rick bayless does his for 2-3 hours

Drain the lime juice from mixture, unfortunately this juice is too fishy to be repurposed elsewhere

Mix in tomatoes and cilantro

Add seasoned salt and lime/orange juice to taste

Serve on fried tortilla and a bed of cabbage

<TEXT> Sure thing, I don't have exact measurements because I just threw things together, but below are rough estimates

Ingredients:
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste

Chicken:
Eggs and flour for coating
Cooking oil (I used canola)

Sauce:
1 stick of butter
Half a bulb of garlic
A cup of parsley
Parmesan cheese


Chicken:
1) boil the chicken wings with slightly salted water until cooked
2) in the meantime, mix flour, salt and pepper into a small bowl
3) once chicken has done boiling and chilled, dip the chicken in the eggs then dip with the flour mix
4) deep fry the chicken wings (I used my cast iron without too much oil so I had to flip each wing after 1.5-2mins each)

Garlic Parmesan sauce:
1) prepare chopped Garlic and parsley for sauce
2) once the wings are done frying, melt butter in a separate pan
3) roast the  garlic and parsley slightly making sure not to burn the garlic 
4) toss the chicken wings in with the mixture and add on the Parmesan and mix

I served my wings by playing the wings, spooning the remaining sauce on top and adding more Parmesan, salt, and pepper to the top
