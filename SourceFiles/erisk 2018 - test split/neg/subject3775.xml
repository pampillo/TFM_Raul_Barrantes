<TEXT> The story comes off as completely ridiculous, and it is. The thing is, if you look around the country, there are hundreds of "local" organizations and weird lawsuits that turn out to be funded by the likes of the Heartland institute and similar conservative PACS/think tanks. An example are "beach rights" and "fishing rights" groups who are opposed to things like public access to the water or the regulation of fishing stocks for the public/common good. In the case of Berkeley for example, why are inflamatory conservative speakers so keen on talking there? It's not like the local population is receptive. They are instead studied provocations. They want to go to Berkeley, because they know they can get a knee jerk reaction from the fringe left/anarchists which will make the whole leftist political movement look bad in the eyes of the right leaning base. I may be reading too much into this guys motivations, but if you read the article, all the witnesses say he seemed to be genuinely not offended, even on the point of the black santa. Now it has changed. Why? Does he  really expect a payout? Doubtful.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Half tongue in cheek. There is evidence of archaic human living in caves along the sea coast in South Africa ~200K BP, but the main thrust of my comment was part of the now discredited aquatic ape theory that we evolved from earlier primate/hominin ancestors that took up living in a coastal environment. According to theory, coastal living lead to both the loss of body hair and high protein seafood diet fueled the evolution of a larger brain </TEXT>

<TEXT> This has the ring of something that has been promoted as deliberate provocation by a conservative group (a euphemism) to try to undermine the credibility of valid discrimination claims. It is on par with Milo Y or Ann Coulter scheduling to speak at historically left wing universities like UC Berkley and UC Davis --i.e. he doesn't really expect to win the lawsuit. What he wants is to inflame the radical fringe who will respond violently to the concept of a white man filing a discrimination complaint as a black man. The underlying intent is try to establish that african americans are a privileged, and un-deserving of that privilege, class (Not my opinion, just my analysis of the agenda behind these antics).

Is this generally accepted in ecological models for food webs including humans? Is the energy input into cooking food part of the overall caloric content that drives human metabolism as compared to say other primates who don't cook their food?

<TEXT> The scenario envisioned here is for a three way galaxy merger. When andromeda and the Milky Way merge in a few billion years, the two black holes will eventually end up orbiting each other in a shrinking spiral leading to merger. If in the meantime another galaxy collided with the merged galaxy, a third johnny come lately black hole would join the dance. However, with the head start, the first are like to merge before the third one gets tightly bound. If the third one is close enough when the first two merge, it might be similarly launched by the gravitation wave of the merger. One question might well be, are there any black holes from the galaxies already eaten and merged with the Milky Way still floating free and not yet descended into close orbit with our own supermassive black hole ? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recent reports of methane bubbles rising to surface off the us pacific and Atlantic coasts suggest deep water temperatures may be rising enough to destabilize extensive methane clathrate deposits. The thinking is this could release a huge methane pulse into the atmosphere that would cause a huge jump in warming which destabilize more clathrate etc. How real is this threat? Is any part of your research focused on validating clathrate stability and out gazing volumes? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is like police racism. As analog, to westerners, all asians are just asians;  but in each of the different asian countries there is a tendency to have a view of the relative superiority/inferiority of each different country.  Police have a similar view. City police may look down on the wildlife enforcement rangers, but in the end; they both of the power of arrest and authority to use force without legal repercussions if their use of force is considered within policy. When it isn't, it is rare for the repercussions to be anything other than "they need to obtain training to understand when it's not ok to beat/shoot/kill someone".  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone from the beach areas where the oil came ashore, I can tell you there are still oil sheens that appear out of the sands along the water line on occasions. Kids digging in the sand will hit a layer of discolored sand, 2-3 feet down and after sitting in the sun, there is a definite chemical smell from the sand. The spill residues are known to contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from both the crude oil and the spill dispersants used on it in great quantities. PAH compounds are known to cause cancer, especially when infants/young children are exposed to them. When those kids playing on the beach get cancer in 8-12 years from now, will those costs be added to the damage totals? </TEXT>

Just prior to this abbreviated passage, the article discusses the missing mass problem and how it gave rise to the theory of dark matter. This passage appears to be suggesting a least a portion of galaxies' dark matter halos could simply be neutral hydrogen gas. However, it never quantifies "a large part of the galaxy's baryonic mass". Are there any theories that dark matter is simply neutral gas surrounding galaxies? </TEXT>

<TEXT> From at least one frozen mammoth's stomach contents, they've found that mammoths ate a type of plant called a forb. Buttercup flowers are an example of a forb. From what I've read, they're not very common up in the tundra latitudes today. There are tree species such as osage orange and pawpaw whose fruit seems adapted to be eaten spread by large herbivore animals, ones that are absent in the ecosystem today. The relative rarity of these trees total suggests that they were part of an ecoweb that is now missing its keystone species. Perhaps the mammoth is that keystone species, and their restoration would bring changes to the tundra or boreal forests the way the restoration of wolves to yellowstone created major changes in the vegetation and landscape. Or, the mammoths could just die out again, because some other element of the overall ecoweb in which they lived is also extinct. </TEXT>

However, the contract definitions section doesn't have any definition of boarding. Lacking a contract definition, it seems this term is subject to english interpretation.

<TEXT> A co-worker from several years back had a hand that was similarly missing a finger, including all the bones in the hand associated with the finger. However, in his hand the missing finger appeared to be the ring finger rather than the pinky. The difference being, in this hand, the ring finger actually appears to be longer than the middle finger, and is completely parallel to the middle finger. In my friend's hand, the last finger was shorter and was angled out, like the pinky is on normal hand. That would also seem to be due to some terminating process in limb/finger growing process that appears to be missing in this case.  </TEXT>

Ever since the Miller-Urey experiment, there have been competing theories for the origin of life energy sources. These have ranged from lighting in the Atmosphere envisioned by Miller-Urey, Sun's UV radiation and more recently the chemical energy from hydrogen sulfide in underwater "black smoker" hot springs.

And what about those safety patrol kids who stop traffic so the other kids can cross the street. Shouldn't they have guns? You never know when some asshole parent, late for work while dropping off their own kid is going to try to run them down.

<TEXT> When asked if it's the policy of the Wilmington Police Department to instruct citizens that it is illegal to film traffic stops, Thompson said, "it is not.". 

This is the wrong question or at least a follow up should have been asked and gotten an answer on record: "was the officers' instruction to turn off the video a lawful order?".   

Police are given wide latitude for their actions after a civilian fails to obey a "lawful order". Whether something is or is not policy in the department, establishing that the order was not lawful would make all their subsequent actions subject to scrutiny for criminality </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is actually one of those scientific mysteries that no one completely knows the answer on --ie we don't really know what gives rise to Earth's magnetic field. Clearly rotation of the planet is a part of it, but it is not complete answer, since looky looky, Mercury has one and doesn't rotate.

<TEXT> This article/study? seems to be predicated solely on the longer rotation time of Mars. If you look at some of the evidence they're citing, it seems like they're forgetting about the actual causes of jetlage  

In mice, a misalignment between internal timekeeping cues and external cues creates a host of problems  

Except on Mars, the external cues --ie the low sun at sunrise and sunset -- will be aligned with a longer clock. Yeah, you'd be jetlagged if you kept to a clock running on Earth's 24 hour day. But if your clock was set to run synchronized with Mars' 24 hours + 37 minute day, the internal clock and the external cues will remain in synchronization </TEXT>

<TEXT> Solar panels are not without environmental impact. They are essentially building roofs that are impervious surface area, increasing rain runoff and soil erosion

There is a dairy and turkey farm near my home which has covered its barns and created sunshade areas for the animals covered in solar panels. In another area, a private school with significant land holdings has fenced off several fields and turned them into solar farms. This same school operates an entertainment facility (ropes course) with still more property used for parking.  

The point here - setting good arable land aside for a solar farm is not a great use for the land. We have a huge amount of land that is already covered with structures or could have structures built on it that allows dual purpose use as solar farm as well as other use, --ie like building  shade covers for a parking lot that is also a solar panel farm, or building sunshades for animals on a farm.  Simply setting aside good land for use as a solar farm is not that much different from building a self storage facility. Yeah, you can make some money but you're not doing the best for the land or the environment

<TEXT> Liquid helium is required to induce ordinary superconductivity in the static magnetic field coils of the MRI. With the discovery of higher temperature superconductors a few years back there was work on building MRI magnetic coils using these materials and then cooling them with liquid nitrogen instead of liquid helium. My recollect of somewhat laymanized papers in the medical imaging press at the time was that the magnetic fields produced from high temperature superconductors were not as uniform as those produced from true superconducting coils. As a result, the prototype MRIs they were testing had to make software corrections to the images produced that reversed the effect of the non-uniformities in the static magnetic field. A lot of imaging professionals pooh poohed these machines saying a radiologist review the images from them would never be able to tell whether something in the image was a true anatomical feature or an artifact introduced into the images from the software corrections. Bottomline, the new devices didn't really catch on but it suggests if liquid helium did become increasingly scarce, there might be alternatives.  Regarding the statement that helium comes from natural gas production, until recently this was true, but only in the fields of north and west texas. In recent years a gas field elsewhere in the world, I think it was in China, was found to be a significant new source of helium, relieving concerns about a world wide shortage of helium as the texas fields became depleted.  </TEXT>

Is it homage to Dale Earnhardt?

Or is it perhaps, a crusader conspiracy to introduce the concept of the Trinity (babe of the matrix)?

<TEXT> Landfills from the early to mid 20th century are already natural gas sources. In some locations this gas is actually trapped and gathered for use/consumption. Where it is exploited commercially, the gas well operator gets an depletion deduction on the income from the gas extraction, same as a natural gas well operator would. In other locations the gas may simply be gathered and flared off to prevent methane leakage into the atmosphere. If you've ever been to Caesar Chavez park on the Berkeley Marina waterfront and noticed the big metal pipe sticking out of the ground, that is the chimney for the gas flare. The park was built on an old landfill. Early in the morning you can see the heat shimmer from the exhaust gases coming out of the chimney  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is a nice bit data you've collected. However, I feel the imagery you've used with the statistics to be a bit misleading. Most of the early firsts were hard landings and did not successfully return any imaging of the surface. Showing surface images from later successful soft landings creates the impression these images  were from the original event  --e.g. Russian Mars 2 lander crashed, sent no images. Russian Mars 3 lander landed, sent one unrecognizable/garbled  [image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Mars_3_Image.png)  before going silent. Picture shown appears to be from Spirit or Opportunity rover. First good/recognizable images returned from Mars came from USA [Viking Lander](http://sen.com/thumbs/1024x576/img/145424924071721454250396.jpg) in 1976. Similar objection to Russian Luna picture. Not clear what mission the picture is from, but suspect one of the Apollo missions. [First image returned from surface of the moon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Luna_9_moon_surface_image.gif) was from Russian Luna 9. All Venus surface images have come from Russian probes but like the moon probes, the first several crashed. [First images from Venus surface](http://mentallandscape.com/C_Venera09.jpg) were from Venera 9, from 1975, much later than the 1966 date of the Venera 2 1966 crash </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, that was the point of the probe. There's not a lot about it and I think it was considered disappointing because of the failure to see some of the expected variations. They concluded later that the probe passed into one of the clear zones between major cloud zones and so did not encounter all of the different cloud layers they expected to get data on. They did record 330 mph winds blowing it sideways though, about 25% higher velocities than expected

<TEXT> So the article seems to be trying to debunk the theory that aboriginal populations were responsible for the extinction of megafauna. They spend most of the time trying to date when the extinctions occurred vs when aboriginals arrived on the continent, concluding that they coexisted for 17,000 years. Yet the article contains an item which would appear to explain this, while still holding the aboriginals responsible.  

It seems that Aboriginal populations may not have been that large until much later in prehistory. Our genomic research has revealed that significant demographic changes did not occur until some 10,000 years ago. The genomic evidence suggests that for tens of thousands of years, Aboriginal populations were not that large.   

If the native population remained small, perhaps due to fairly capable predators, maybe also due to lack of effective hunting technologies, perhaps this is what allowed coexistence. Perhaps too aboriginals finally prospered and grew numerous to hunt the megafauna into extinction once they developed appropriate hunting technologies, many thousands of years after first arriving.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are books that have been written about the Nazi psyops operations in France prewar. Here's a brief mention on a page devoted to psychological warfare  

http://survinat.com/2012/04/psychological-operations-during-the-second-world/

During the fighting in the West Germans acted very quickly and quite ingenious. The psychological impact on the enemy, they used everything: favorable for itself so-cal environment, and raising slogans of the enemy, and the natural tendency of people to stay alive, to tell of their fate the family and friends (see leaflets in Fig. 36-38) .

His biggest success of German propaganda had made in 1940, during the occupation of France. In the months before the invasion of France advocates Goebbels began to actively use the so-called "black" transmitters that masqueraded as French radio. They spread all sorts of rumors were subjected to fierce criticism of the French government, sowing uncertainty and panic among the people and the military. As a result, by the time a decisive attack German troops morale of the personnel of the French Army has been so eroded that it was not able to have a serious resistance to the invaders

Much of the coverage of the "Fake News" is glossing over exactly what it means, but there are some articles describing it.  
http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-undermine-west-democracies-2016-10

Discussion of the russian troll army has kind of died down, but much of it is documented in wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_brigades  

Anybody who has posted on reddit pointing out russian actions in moving public opinion can see that there are well organized responses and negative voting on reddit. If you don't think that impacts people's opinions, you're kidding yourself </TEXT>

The Russian manipulation of the US Election wasn't just hacking the DNC. They've been engaged in a media and viral internet campaign for years, creating the divisions and anxieties in western societies. In short, a psychological operation targeting the value norms of the US population to make election of someone like Donald Trump possible.  France is no less vulnerable. There is evidence that a similar campaign is ongoing. It is similar to the Psyops that the Nazis ran against France sapping their faith in the government and military prior to the Nazi attack.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some of your commuting regions seemed arbitrarily large, incorporating several major commuting central cities in large regions whereas in other areas you have small distinct commuting zones. Examples of both.  

a) Arbitrarily large - in the /r/DataIsBeautiful rendering of your map, the area labeled Central Florida on the map linked in this post was labeled "Tampa". This appeared to incorporate extended commuting for Tampa/St Pete, Orlando, Florida Space Coast, Ocala/Gainesville, and Lake City into a single region.  There are very definitely multiple central draws in this mega region with Tampa/St Pete and Orlando being major centers. Regional centers like Ocala, Gainesville, and Lake City would all be fairly small, and one could argue combining them into a single entity. However, I have to question why you would combine all of these areas into a mega region. Clearly no one is commuting from the far edges of this region to the major centers -- e.g. nobody commutes from Lake City to Orlando or Tampa/St Pete.  Similarly, nobody commutes from the Space Coast to Lake City or Gainesville. What was your criteria for the aggregation instead segregation into multiple overlapping centers?  

A similar argument can be made for other very large regions like the New Orleans and Delta Region. Florida Panhandle commuting can be drawn to Mobile, Pensacola or military complexes further east at Fort Walton/Panama City. New Orleans has its own draw, spilling into both coastal Louisiana and Mississipi.  Jackson and Memphis are each regional commuting centers

b) Multiple Distinct - your linked map has this combined in the Columbia plateau region, but the colored map on data is beautiful actually had multiple small regions in eastern Washington state around Spokane, Yakima and the Tri-Cities Richland/Kennewick and Walla Walla. Why were they separated out when the megaregions weren't? Why have you now aggregated them? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Does this suggest that the humans living in North America didn't need an ice free corridor to open up for them to reach the more temperate regions further south? Recent dating of sites in Florida, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia and even down into South America suggest human presence south of the ice sheets before the ice free corridor opened up. It was estimated that the corridor needed to be open 200-300 years before there were sufficient plants and animals to allow humans to navigate the 1500 miles from the northern icesheet margin to the areas south of the form icesheet locations. This has driven the theories that early settlers of the Americas must have used boats to navigate down the coast. If they were living in the lands north of the icesheet during the glacial maximum, is it possible they had the means to make some of that journey over the ice itself? </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a positive feedback loop built into global warming that is entirely due to reflection/absorption of sunlight, and it is one of the largest concerns over the coming decades.   

While your comments about decreased albedo due to rock replacing melting ice are accurate, the quote statement is false. Gobal warming/climate change is being driven by the greenhouse effect from CO2, methane, and water vapor in the atmosphere. It is called "the greenhouse effect" because radiation comes in from the sun, is absorbed by various surfaces on the earth and re-radiated as infrared radiation. The greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increase the amount that is absorbed back by the atmosphere rather than being radiated into space. H2O in the atmosphere has not appreciably changed. CO2 and and methane have. There are also effects from soot particles in clouds and on snow/ice fields that increase the absorption rather than reflection (as you cite) but again, the primary effect driving the increasing temperatures is the greenhouse gases that stop the infrared radiation from leaving the planet </TEXT>

<TEXT> So at the current time no one is really extracting commercially viable biofuel from cellulosic sources because the breakdown of cellulose is so energy intensive.   From this perspective, it is not really clear how they can make the claim that Miscanthus is 2.4 times more productive for biofuel than switchgrass, since neither one is currently viable. The great hope is that some yeasts can be bio-engineered to break down cellulose into sugars for ethanol production very efficiently. However,  if this happens, the cellulose byproducts of food crops could do double duty of producing both food and fuel --e.g., after harvesting corn, the corn stalks could be fermented into fuel. Same for wheat stalks, rice stalks, etc. Why grow a stalks only crop for fuel production when you could get food and fuel from the same crop?  </TEXT>

Stars in galaxies orbit as if they're embedded like a plate inside a sphere/spheroid of mass. The planar form of visible matter is somehow linked to ordinary matter interacting at the electromagnetic and nuclear forces level when particles hit each other. The theories of dark matter postulate it is made of WIMPs, Weakly Interacting Massive Particles - the key point "weakly interacting" meaning, they don't bump into things or deflect each other when they do. The formation of visible matter into discs is dependent on the fact that they do interact when they bump into each other </TEXT>

Basically, the AMOC is the effect that occurs when the Gulf Stream, with a payload of warmer, saltier water arrives in the region of Greenland and Iceland. Cold katabatic winds blowing off the Greenland icecap create a huge heat transfer from the ocean to the atmosphere, rapidly cooling the water, which then sinks into the depths due to both its temperature and salinity. The sinking cold water is the wellhead of the global deep ocean cold currents, ACOM. The heat transfer into the atmosphere is essential for the warmer-than-would-be-expected-for-the-latitude climate of Iceland, UK and much of Western Europe. The mechanics of the ACOM are dependent on the saltiness of the Gulf Stream waters. Without the elevated salinity, the cooled surface water would merely diffuse into the already cool waters present in the area. There are probably other vertical upwellings driven by the sinking waters as well that drive higher biological productivity, and therefore fisheries in the region as well. From the past few years harsh winters in North America and Western Europe driven by the destabilization of the Arctic Polar high and the increased unfrozen waters of the Arctic Ocean, it is obvious climate change can have some unforeseen and not modeled effects on weather. A lot of the concern about the ACOM is due to a sudden cooling in the climate after the last maximum glaciation was receeding and the large ice sheets in North America were melting. It is theorized that a thousand year cooling period about 11,000 years ago was caused by large amounts of glacial meltwater diluting the salinity of the Gulf Stream at the Gulf of St Lawrence and, in theory, disrupting the ACOM. Hence the concern that it will do so again. However, others have modeled the degree to which the higher latitudes are already warming due global climate warming against the loss of the ocean-atmosphere heat transfer with an ACOM disruption. The results are suggest that at most there would be a slight cooling of northern Europe until the overall global warming caught up. Thus, while an ACOM disruption may be a disaster for fisheries and may in fact increase weather swings, it is unlikely to drive a broad cooling of the climate in Europe as it did 11,000 years ago.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So two parts responses to your answer. Yes, to be a planet, it must have cleared its own orbit. However, this is somewhat of a evolutionary based argument that presumes a planet forming in the early solar nebula that is rife with planetesimals for it to clear. In a sense, the Moon has cleared its own orbit, the one that happens to be around the Earth. Early in its formation there were likely many different objects still in Earth orbit left over from the collision that formed the Moon in the first place. There is a theory that the earth had a 2nd moon of 100-200 km in diameter that collided with the farside of the moon some millions of years after its formation, hence the very different surface chemistry of the farside. All that said - if the Moon was ejected from the Earth's orbit by passing through a Lagrange point with some residual velocity, depending on the geometry of that passage, it would either descend to a lower orbit between Earth and Venus or rise to higher orbit between the Earth and Mars due to its own velocity being either added or subtracted from Earth's orbital velocity around the Sun. Since solar orbits are essentially empty compared to the conditions in the solar nebula from which the "orbit clearing" definition is derived, it would be in a cleared orbit albeit, one that it did not itself clear. However, anyone finding it there would be inclined to call it a planet rather than a dwarf planet since there are not a plethora of other objects that it could potentially collide with.  Regarding the time required. At the current rate of recession, it would take the Moon 39 billion years to reach the L1 Lagrange point, at 1.5 M km out toward the sun. So, yeah, the sun is going to eat us all before that would ever happen. More to the point, the Moon's rate of recession will decline to zero as it gets increasingly further from Earth and as the Earth's rotation slows.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I speculated about this on AskScience sometime back, thinking that at some point the Moon would pass through one of the Lagrange points where the Earth's and Sun's gravity equal out. Assuming the Moon passed through one of these points with its own forward motion/orbital velocity, it should be ejected into solar orbit instead of remaining in orbit around the Earth. Somebody shot me down, not on the basis of solar expansion, but instead on the declining recession of the Moon. As the Moon moves out from the Earth, it is robbing the Earth of rotational energy, slowly lengthening our day. There will come a point when the Moon and the Earth are tidally locked with the Earth rotating and the same speed that the Moon orbits. At this point, the Moon stops receding from the Earth.  This has already occurred with Pluto and Charon - They're tidally locked, with each of them presenting the same face to each other as they orbit around each other. With the Earth and the Moon, this will occur before the Moon gets far enough away to break away into solar orbit </TEXT>

<TEXT> I keep bees and often have discussions with a friend who grew up on a kibbutz among orange groves in Israel. He also keeps bees and told how, as a preteen on the kibbutz he used to catch bees foraging for nectar, putting them into a screened hive box. After a few days of confinement in the box with sugar water, he opened the box. The captured bees, most of which probably came from completely different hives, took up residence in the box, drew comb and began collecting nectar. There was no queen, so there was no brood but after a while, the hive developed what sometimes happens in real hives, he got a laying worker. The eggs they lay always produce drones. So, these workers, isolated from their own hive and confined with a bunch of other bees bonded into a new colony and took up some of the foraging and comb production activities that a real colony with a queen would do.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not in any way an expert on earthquakes or tsunamis but have seen descriptions of what has happened in cases where tsunamis have formed. These cases include very significant seabed rifting resulting from the earthquake and earthquake setting off large underwater landslides. In both these cases there is sharp disconnect between closely adjacent sections of seabed in contact with the water. For example in the case of seabed rifting, the seabed rips apart, with the different sections moving in opposite directions. [This article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/feb/10/highereducation.research)  discusses some of the large rifts discovered off the coast of Aceh in the aftermath of the Boxing Day earthquake. Large tsunamis generated from the 1964 Alaska and more recent ones in New Guinea have been traced to [large submarine landslides](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/feb/10/highereducation.research). In those cases a similar effect occurs - close proximity of seabed that moves against the water and other seabed that doesn't. While I don't have the exact geoscience, I'd suggest the critical factor for a tsunami formation is a sharp shear in the pressure wave communicated to the water. If you just have regular seismic waves, you get a pressure wave, but with a continuous distribution of force change, which does not cause a tsunami </TEXT>

<TEXT> Was looking at the size of the yellow band across the middle of stacked graphs, then at the legend. Thought, no way solar has that much of the total energy share. Took a second to see there are two yellows, one for the solar the other for natural gas.   

It suggests to me that this chart could be improved with some color palette choices that are more intuitively associated with the energy sources:  

1) Coal - Dark Grey, same as it ever was  

2) Nuclear - Try to match the color of Cerenkov radiation color, Electric Blue,  Hex triplet, #7DF9FF

3) Natural Gas - Lighter blue, like the color of gas stove flame Blue, Hex triplet #3E65C0  

4) Hydropower - normally would say another blue, like Ocean Blue,  but think that would be too many blues too close together. Since you often see the white water gushing out of the hydroelectric dam spill ways, suggest a white #000000 might be better  

5) Petroleum - Blackest black, #FFFFFF  

6) Wind - Green, like the energy it generates and the grass that grows around the turbine ~~#7cfc00~~  
EDIT - Take back, this green, which was listed online as "grass green", looks more like prestone antifreeze. Suggest #4cbb17 Kelley Green is more appropriate. Also, realized "Other" - #9 below is generation from municipal waste incineration, a producing highly toxic waste contaminated with heavy metals. Not sure of the best indicator for toxic waste color, but prestone green fits the bill

7) Wood - Brown, like it already is  

8) Geothermal - Red hot, the color of the lava that makes it go #cf1020  

9) Other - ~~the light grey nothingness it represents~~ Municipal waste incineration. Should be coded with something indicative of toxic waste. Prestone green #7cfc00 or perhaps Magenta #ff00ff

10) Solar - The color of the Sun on a summer day, #FDB813

<TEXT> just us chickens this far down the thread. my original point is still valid: the reddit title overstates the case. Ice sheet dynamics is still an evolving science. It seems intuitive that melting ice shelves will destabilized the glaciers penned up behind them, but at the moment, this is just a working theory. By claiming it as fact --e.g. "melting ice shelves raise sea levels" -- you're guilty of over-hype and exaggeration of the *immediate* effects. In effect, it is giving aid and  comfort to the climate change deniers because they can point to statements like yours to make the case that the effects of climate change are not an immediate problem that needs to be addressed. Overstating the immediate effects can make be used to make advocates for reducing fossil carbon emissions as alarmist "shy is falling" enthusiasts. I've no doubt that the melting of the ice shelves will eventually lead to a portion of the Totten Icefield catchment basin, but claiming the Totten Iceshelf melting will result in 11 feet of ocean rise is both provably false and undercutting the argument of its actual long term effects   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll let the National Snow and Ice Data Center educate you. Here is their [Quick Facts on Ice Shelves](https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/quickfacts/iceshelves.html). A very brief excerpt from the page:  

**Why are ice shelves important?**  

Because ice shelves already float in the ocean, *they do not contribute directly to sea level rise when they break up.* However, ice shelf collapse could contribute to sea level rise indirectly. Ice streams and glaciers constantly push on ice shelves, but the shelves eventually come up against coastal features such as islands and peninsulas, building pressure that slows their movement into the ocean. If an ice shelf collapses, the backpressure disappears. The glaciers that fed into the ice shelf speed up, flowing more quickly out to sea. Glaciers and ice sheets rest on land, so once they flow into the ocean, they contribute to sea level rise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Got my units wrong meters, rather than feet, but not my point. The Totten Iceshelf is already in the water and its melting will not raise the sea level at all. The catchment basin behind the Totten Iceshelf includes other glaciers covering an area equivalent in size to California. It is only a portion of the East Antarctic Icecap, but alone has 11 feet of sea level rise potential IF it all melted. The complete melting of the entire Totten Glacier/Iceshelf catchment basis is very very unlikely. The main scientific point of the article is that the supposed stability of the East Antarctic icecap through global warming scenarios does not conform to the sea level rises from only Greenland and West Antarctica melting. At least some portion of East Antarctica will likely melt. The glaciers behind the melting Totten Iceshelf are pointed to as one likely source of additional melting/sea level rise from East Antarctic...  if the melting of the iceshelf does in fact destabilize the inland glaciers (which seems likely)... in the future. My argument with the title was the Totten Iceshelf, which is being documented as melting right now, will not in of itself raise the sea level.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reddit title misrepresents information in the article. The Totten Iceshelf is considered a "stopper" for a large catchment basis of multiple other inland glaciers with a combined area the size of California. IF the melting of the Totten Iceshelf destabilizes all of those glaciers;  and then  IF the entire catchment basin of glaciers  melted entirely, it would raise sea level by 11.5 meters.  

The first IF is a definitely possibility. The second IF is almost certainly not going to happen, at least not within a 1000 years. It is possibly though, that some portion of that volume will melt.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I have a googleganger (person with the same name as myself) living the same state that I live in. This person is apparently a financial scofflaw who has defaulted on numerous personal, mortgage and home equity loans which have been turned over to collection agencies. Unable to locate him, these agencies have apparently searched for him on the internet or databases, found my name, address and phone number. I receive calls every day from collection agencies (Transworld, Ocwen,  etc). Some of them quite aggressive in their tone. Usually they demand that I tell them my social security number so they can verify my identity. First, I tell them I know who they're looking for and it isn't me. Second, I tell them that I will not give them my SSN, but they should tell me the SSN of the person they're looking for so I can either confirm or deny that it is me. I also tell them that they have illegally associated my phone number with their collection account and need to remove it. Their answer is that they will not take my phone number out of the record until I give them my SSN. I'm not going to do that for obvious reasons. Question  I have here: having put my phone number into their databases, can they impact my credit rating or even put a lien on my house through their mis-identification of me as their collection target?

This seemed to be exactly counter to observations of stellar motion that gave rise to the discovery of dark matter in the first place --i.e. stellar motion of stars in the galaxy is consistent with the disc of the galaxy being embedded in a roughly spherical halo of dark matter. Is there any evidence that dark matter actually clusters more densely in the galactic plane than in other parts of the halo?

<TEXT> There is a saying, "All maps are politically biased". Apologies for inferring intent on your data mapping when the bias is apparently included in the toolset you used. It would be very illustrative to see how the toolset deals with other disputed boundaries and occupied territories. For example how does it map out the following cases:  

1) Israel, Gaza and West Bank   

2) Turkish   Greek Cypriot governments in Cyprus (UK military base territories as well).  

3) Nagorno-Karabakh region of Armenia and Azerbaijan  

4) Pakistan, India and China occupied portions of Kashmir and Jammu  

5) Kosovo as separate country or part of Serbia?  

6) Chinese occupied Arunchal-Pradesh India. 

7) Chinese occupied  border regions in Bhutan

<TEXT> It is a shame this discussion is about China and its imperialist ambitions in the next century as my point was about this post in Reddit. There is an agenda at work here at "normalizing" the idea that Morocco owns and has right to own Western Sahara. China is only relevant as an example of another country that in recent memory has solidified their take over of another territory with seemingly innocuous maps. What I am pointing out is there are no internationally recognized maps showing Morocco as including Western Sahara. Somebody had to go out of their way to make those maps and then populate them with data, perhaps real, perhaps faked in order to make this subtle point. The post is not about the progress of Africa. It is about getting maps of Morocco with Western Sahara annexed into the public record </TEXT>

Large swaths of Russia, all of the 'stans, Burma, Laos, vietnam and India were at one point part of one Chinese country or another. The issue is that Chinese seem to believe any territory that was ever conquered in Chinese history is rightfully theirs. </TEXT>

1950, Oct 7 1950 to be exact. 
Tibet was an independent country following the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911, with limited international recognition, but including Britain. At the UN conference in 1945, China simply published a map claiming Tibet. In 1950, they marched in and took the country by force.  

The Moroccans effectively control most of the ground in Western Sahara, having marched in when the Spanish picked up and left, but the locals do not recognize their claim and have waged a low level insurgency for more than 30 years.

<TEXT> This is the second post in the last week that I've seen that shows Morocco as consisting of the internationally recognized Morocco and Western Sahara formerly Spanish Sahara colony), minus what are apparently some areas in the eastern areas of the country controlled by the [Polisaro Liberation Front](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Western_sahara_map_showing_morocco_and_polisaro.gif). Google maps doesn't show Morocco extending over the territory. The [UN doesn't recognize their sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_status_of_Western_Sahara#Mauritania) of the area. I can't help but think theses posts that are ostensibly about a completely different topic are instead part of a disinformation campaign similar to China's taking over Tibet by publishing maps showing it as a part of their country, then simply moving in when at least a portion of the world started thinking it was a reality.

<TEXT> There is a level of arbitraryness to the assignment of the regions. I am very surprised for example to see Tampa/St Pete all the way up to Jax shown as single region. Orlando and the Space Coast are a major commuting hub, separate for Tampa. There is also a lesser region of small cities to the north along the Ocala/Gainesvile/Lake City axis. This is only one example. There are also some strange counter mappings, such as in central / eastern washington were the Tricities and some unknown location/city are shown in separate colored region between Seattle / Spokane   / Portland regions. Chicago region is also strangely canted south with regions of the Chicago commuter rail lines shown to be in the Milwaukee region There is probably a lot of overlap there, but technically these regions should be shown with overlapping/transparent clouds so you could see the overlaps

<TEXT> The blink circuit used in most cars depends on the line resistance to the bulbs. I know this from watching the timing of my blinker change when I connect and disconnect my boat trailer lights connector. In some cars, the timing of the blinker also changes pretty radically when one of the blinker bulbs burns out (front or back), giving you an audio indication that the light you can't see inside your car is burned out. In all likelihood, the timing of your blinker also changes slightly with the humidity, at least with older cars where the wire insulation has developed cracks. The resistance of the bulb also changes slightly as it ages. All of these factors conspire to ensure that even cars of the same model won't have exactly the same blinker timing.  </TEXT>

The crazy dude killing people doesn't necessarily relate to mental health either. There are a lot of people who equate rights of free speech and freedom of association with a right to be a hateful, resentful creep. The people who want to claim the problem with gun violence is really a mental health issue are usually in that camp, although more from a gun rights rather than a freedom of speech perspective. I often wonder whether they realize what they're saying --i.e., the mental health services of the country should be able to survey and predict criminal behavior in the population so it can be pre-emptively prevented?

He talked about some protestors that were picketing the base in the late 80's (when all the IRBM protests were going on in Europe). Anyway, the protestors covered their hands with superglue and glued **themselves** to things.  A bunch of them glued their hands to the posts on the gate at the base entrance. Others formed themselves into human knots, then glued their hands to the wrists and ankles of other people in the knot. This was kind of ingenious as they were in this huge pile of people blocking the road. The cops couldn't pull individual people out of the knot without ripping off their skin. The collection of people was too large to move all at once. My buddy got a day off work will they figured out how to get them apart and out of the road.

<TEXT> This article does a really lousy job of explaining the link between reindeer die offs and global warming. The reddit title is even more obfuscating. While there is a link between the phenomenon, a climate skeptic could easily point to this reddit title with derision to claim climate change proponents are a bunch of sky is falling ninnies. After all, how could a lack of sea ice cause land animals to die?  

The actual causal chain looks like this: warmed arctic climate reduces sea ice -- open waters in Arctic Ocean transfer increased moisture to late fall frigid arctic winds -- moisture laden air dumps huge early season snowfalls in Siberia -- deep snow prevents reindeer from reaching forage vegetation -- reindeer herds starve.   

It is an example of the complexity of how global climate change effects will manifest themselves, and probably in ways most people don't intuitively expect. Posting a title claiming cause and effect without explaining it can give aid and comfort to an enemy that will exploit the claims based on a silliness factor and unbelieve-ability   </TEXT>

<TEXT> At the time of the redbull jump, there was discussion as to whether he would break the sound barrier during his fall. My recollection is that it was concluded after the fact that he did. Your jump was a few weeks later. Presumably you also broke the sound barrier. Visually or physically, what was your perception of this? Could you see a shockwave coming off the top of your helmet? In the movies of Chuck Yeager's first supersonic flight there was very high turbulence just before breaking the sound barrier, then an abrupt cessation of the turbulence after the shock wave was established. Did you experience anything like that as a free falling body? Did you have any controls or devices to keep yourself from tumbling or losing control of your trajectory at the maximum speed? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, no matter where you are, the moon orientation to the observer rotates 180 degrees from moonrise to moon set. In the northern hemisphere the full moon has the classic man-in-the-moon illusion at moonrise. At moonset it has rotated around and is much easier to see the Japanese cukture's crab-in-the-moon. However for me in North America it is exactly flipped over from this view, with the crabs claw arching over the top and the claw tips pointed at the horizon. I'm guessing this pic was taken at moonrise, so it is very interesting to me to see it both in "crab" like orientation BUT upside down from how I normally see it. I'm betting for Southern Hemisphere viewers, it also appears to rotate around in the opposite direction from what northern hemisphere viewers see. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you're discussing the projected sea level rise assuming we keep warming under 4C. The point of this paper was that the temperature rise is way more sensitive to CO2 rises that the IPCC concensus models have been predicting. Basically they're saying it may be double the warming, and typically such models are highly biased for much higher warming in the high latitudes. There's a lot of thermal inertia in the ice caps, but if they're having 90 degree days on the ice and the ocean at the ice margin is 70 degrees, a lot more of that ice is going to melt and move into the ocean than the ipcc projections. Current sea level rise projects are basically just steady state ocean thermal expansion combined with a steady state melting model. The problem is the possible or even probably nonlinear change when the dynamic equilibrium between the perched glacial pressure and the grounded glacial snouts. Think of that nanhattan sized collapse from last year multiplied by a thousand or a million. If that happens, the water could go up very high, very fast. The question is, is this increased sensitivity the kind of thing that could trigger it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> While there is a need to increase sequestration to undo 200 years of industrial revolution, the more important thing to do is to stop extraction and conversion of fossil carbon into atmospheric co2. There is a natural process by which plankton form shells out of calcium and co2 then die, and drop their shells to the sea bottom. Similarly with algae. They've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years. Then we dig/pump it out of the ground and dump millions of years worth of accumulated fossil carbon into the air in a matter of decades. There's only so much the biosphere can take up and sequester in the lithosphere. We really need to get our energy and concrete from carbon that's already mobile in the atmosphere and biosphere, not keep pulling it out of the lithosphere. </TEXT>

Other than the fossil dna in these aboriginal peoples, we don't know anything about that third branch.

<TEXT> While that is a true statement, temperature rises that high will cause increased melting of grounded ice shelves and above water glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica. Without the grounded ice shelves holding them back, there is the possibility of a massive slide into the sea from west Antarctica, with sea level rises of 20-30 feet. These are already predicted to happen in 300-500 years anyway. Question is whether the increased warming predicted will accelerate these events to be occurring within current living and more importantly for banks and insurance companies, financial lifetimes </TEXT>

Instead you can reach up and across the aisle to retrieve your back. If you're late in the boarding sequence and there isn't much overhead space left, start looking for open overhead bins with space before you get to your row. If you see an overhead bid space, take it. This way you won't have wait for the rows behind you to leave the plane before you can get to your bag.  </TEXT>

Heard an interesting podcast a while back discussing the possible reasons for the decline of scientific advancement in Islamic cultures. Given the accomplishments of the Caliphate, one would have expected them to advance technologically. One possible reason was the role authoritarianism in Islamic culture. The Caliphates never developed the scientific method, which itself requires postulating theories that may threaten what is "known" to be established scientific principle. In essence, the word and opinion of the authority became more important than the subject that they were an authority on.

<TEXT> My basic argument as well - I think this was written by someone with a climate change skepticism bias with words intentionally chosen to be misunderstood and misquoted by the skeptic camp. More to the point, their use of the term does not appear to be borne out by the data. There may be an actual scientific effect to be studied --ie is the distance between to the peaks and the troughs of the seasonal sawtooth variation getting bigger as the overall CO2 concentration rises -- but the language used suggests this paper was instead intended to be a bogus scientific reference climate skeptics could cite to encourage doubt that atmospheric CO2 is still increasing.

<TEXT> I feel the choice of the word "pause", as in the "pause in the growth rate", was made deliberately with the intention of making it seem as if the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere has flattened and stopped.  Technically it may not be inaccurate, but what is being described is the change in 2nd derivative --ie the CO2 increase has stopped accelerating year to year (perhaps); but overall CO2 accumulation is still going up year to year, not pausing.  A better description would be that the accumulation of atmospheric has stopped increasing exponentially. Even this is controversial statement as direct measurements don't appear to show any slowdow  

Annual accumulation rate as measured by NOAA at Mauna Kea

Both have express elevators that go all the way up to the top as well as shorter length express that go to first and 2nd "sky lobbies", with the vast majority of the elevator shafts running between ground and first skylobby, first and 2nd sky lobby.

<TEXT> Imagine a subway system where every train has to have its own track. This is essentially the elevator problem in large skyscrapers today. At a certain height/size building, you have to build more train tracks to move more people than can be economically dedicated to the building. The cableless elevator is attempting fix this issue in the same way you would address the issue  in a transit system with limited numbers of tracks. First step is simply being able to have more than one train on the track at a time. Such elevators would be subject to same kinds of delays one sees in metro systems today - e.g. having to wait outside a station while the train in front of you loads and unloads. Or, having to wait on a line while a car coming in the opposite direction clears an area of shared track.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The article I read on it indicated elevator cables have to be able to support the cargo weight of the car plus the weight of the cable. The longer the cable, the more of that total weight is the cable, requiring a fatter cable, which weighs corresponding more. The cable also has be able to be contained on a reel that fits within the limited space confines of the building core. The multiple constraint satisfaction equation brings it to about 800 feet. Many of those constraints don't apply to the ski lifts and gondola systems -i.e. they don't have to lift straight up and are less limited in the space for the supporting infrastructure. Again, much of this is a combination of technological and economic argument that goes into the total design problem </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you ride up the elevator to the top and stay in it to ride back down, then yes. Very typically it would unload, close doors, traverse sidewise, then re-open doors at a different location used for downshaft loading. Conceptually no different than a train unloading on one platform, driving down to the buffers, switch tracks, and reload people headed back downtown on the other platform.  Funny that you should have an issue with going sideways in an elevator. Most people would instead be terrified by riding in an elevator that doesn't have a cable holding it up. Instead it just has drive motors that pull it up or lower it down the shaft.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the factors is elevator technology. This is somewhat obsolete because some of the new buildings are using a new, cable-less elevator design, but a major limiting factor in the past has been the maximum length of elevator cables, which is on the order of 800 feet, and the size of the corresponding building core needed to house multiple tiers of elevators. Newer sky scrapers are using cable-less elevator that run one-way in the shaft, so you can have multiple cars in the same shaft at a time. At various points, the elevator shifts horizontally over to a down shaft.  
--- EDIT---  
I should state that this basically an economic limitation. The higher the building, the more lift capacity you need to get people up and down/to and from the usable space in the building. With cabled elevators, one elevator per shaft, this means more elevator shafts. These require space in the building core, leaving less room for actual "building". There is also the height limitation that means passengers have to get off at some midpoint and head over to a different bank of elevators. Toward the higher floors, you can have fewer elevators going up because a smaller percentage of the total number of people entering the building are going to the upper levels. The point is, the building has to pay for itself in service traffic. If you built a super tall building, the first 1000 or so feet of the building would have to be all elevators just to be able to move the number of required people for higher floors. Putting multiple elevators per shaft helps reduce that building core foot print, but it is still limiting factor, once you establish a base people moved per hour per shaft metric.

<TEXT> For nearby stars, the distance can be determined through parallax measurements. The position of the star is measured against the background of distant stars, or preferably galaxies, at opposite sides of the Earth's orbit around the sun. The star will show a shifted position from these two readings. From these two position readings, you can compute an angle between the two observations Knowing the distance from opposite sides the Earth's orbit, or actually just the Earth's distance from the Sun, because you take half the angle between the positions. So you now have a right triangle from which you know the base (the distance from earth to the sun), and the angle at the apex (the line direct from the sun to the star, and the line from the earth to the star). Albeit, it is a very tall and narrow triangle, but using trigonometry you can compute the length of the sides of the triangle with the angle and base length. It's a little more complicated than that because you also have to look at the offset angle of the star from plane of the Earth's orbit, and compute a correction to the length of the base; but using this method you can get pretty accurate out to about 100 parsecs or 326 light years.   

The other method that is used is to look at the star's brightness in the sky compare the measured brightness to a model of how bright a star of that size   type should be --i.e. compare it's actual/relative brightness to a model of the absolute brightness for a star of its size and type. The difference between these can be used to compute the distance due to light attenuating over distance  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is very much like the assertions that Islam requires women to be shrouded, segregated from non relative males, etc. despite never appearing to be codified in any sacred religious texts. The ban on women in the preisthood may very well be dogma, but it is a reflection of "culture" rather than having any basis in the religion itself. Claiming it is part of the core religious belief is simply a power argument where an entrenched group seeks to maintain their monopoly by claiming a historical practice is equivalent to adhering to the religion itself </TEXT>

I recall when this was published and there being discussion about it being a boon to cryptology because you could easily use it for cryptographic keys. In any event, wondered why you couldn't use this to compute a sequence in Hex, approximating about where the Nth base 10 digit would be, then convert the Hex digit answer to base 10. Is your question concerned with getting to exactly the Nth base 10 digit, or being able to quickly get to some randomly chosen position in the sequence of pi, and representing it in base 10? </TEXT>

<TEXT> What does "a great deal of influence" mean? Is it implied they're lesbians, which would be a kind of puritanical / moral backlash. Consider if president park had a long time male lover, would there be such angst about someone personnally close to the president advising her? Another analogy might very well be Nancy Reagan's astrologist. Supposedly Nancy's influence of Ron, and the astrologists influence over Nancy lead to cases where the Astrologist's advice was used in US presidential decision making. One can see how this would also be very negative, implying a lack of serious and professional judgement in the person one expects to have a level, serious mind controlling the direction of the country. Everything else I can see as simply hyperbole that Korea's equivalent of Foxnews, Brietbart have spun their own cult like disciples into a frenzy over, having scented blood in the water.  

--EDIT---  
It is a valid question I think. It seems there is a lot of passion in the controversy that from a distance, people outside of Korea don't understand. It would be helpful if you could make explicit what is behind some of the euphemisms or innuendo that are behind this </TEXT>

<TEXT> When you look at the political anger in West Virginia and Kentucky, there are, or were, a lot of poor people mining coal in these states. There were also a lot of people making big bucks out of those coal mines. They're also slicing the tops of mountains off to get to the coal and filling up green valleys with tailings from those sliced off mountains. Poor people are impacted by the pollution, by the permanent destruction of green space, etc; but what they remember is when they lose their job. When the power plant down the river converts the boilers to gas, or installs gas turbines, they stop buying coal and the coal mine drops shifts, or closes entirely. They don't care their health is being ruined, their kids are sick, their land is being polluted. They care that they can't buy hot dogs and budweiser because they're not working shifts anymore </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the 1980's I worked on sonar systems for the US Navy that were designed for operations under the polar ice cap. The descriptions of the underside of the cap were of a giant upside down forest and jumbled upside down mountain ranges formed from multi-year ice piling up and getting pushed down in a jagged icescape.  This was in contrast to the single year sea ice that forms a monotoniic flat ice ceiling. With the arctic moving toward a ice free summers, that high surface area/lots of hiding places under ice environment is disappearing. It calls into question what ecological niches are disappearing with that undersea icescape? What species depend on it for development and survival?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was a kid going to school in New Mexico, there was a small tongue of Texas about 1/2 mile wide and about 2 miles long that stuck out of Texas across the longitude ~~130~~ 101 degree west meridian into New Mexico (NM eastern side)on large scale state maps they had in the classroom. It still showed up on maps when Mapquest first started doing online mapping, but no longer appears in Google maps or Bing. I figured there had to be an interesting story around that but have never seen it explained, or its disappearance in modern days  
----- EDIT ----   
Actually, the more I think about it, the tongue might have been the opposite direction - a bit of New Mexico intruding into Texas. Either way it's missing from maps now. Anybody that knows, would be interested to the story.  

----EDIT 2 --- 
Yah, typo/dyslexia reading the longitude off google maps mouse pointer URL: 101st meridian. The tongue shaped protrusion was near Clovis NM/Cannon AFB (south of there). Often wondered if it was some kind of federal thing associated with the military </TEXT>

<TEXT> a recent nature magazine podcast discussed some of the issues around a recent trend to start using house pets in clinical drug trials. The lack of strict environmental controls, dosing and genetic diversity of pets vs standard laboratory animals was cited for both positive and negative factors. How have you modified your trial protocols for these factors (as compared to how you would run a trial with lab mice or ferrets for example)? Motivation was another topic discussed. Pet trials are seen as more realistic than lab animal studies when trying a drug with potential as a human drug. However there is downside of not being able to ask the drug subject how they feel, e.g. Quality of life and adverse side effect issues that can be captured in a human trial. Will you be utilizing the pet owners assessment of these type of factors in your trial methodology / data collection? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Somebody recently asked a question on askscience about being able to hear the time difference between the actual sound path and the sound being picked up by radio/walkietalkie transmitted at speed of light, and re-issued as sound by the receiver. It so happens I have direct experience with this in yacht/sailboat racing. The committee boat uses a horn or shotgun to signal various time points in the starting sequence: Basically a "ready","set","1 minute" and "go" set of sound signals. These can either be 3 minutes or 5 minutes apart (except for the 1 minute before the "go" signal). The starting line is usually about 1/4 mile long. Boats of multiple classes waiting for their start are sailing and milling about an area of about 1/2 mile radius from the race committee. The race committee keeps an open radio channel calling out which of multiple different starts they're doing, and giving a 5-4-3-2-1 count down for some signals. (This helps people setting their watch). Point is, the sound of the horn or shotgun used for the signal goes through the radio channel, and yes you can hear a very definitely difference in the sound arrival time from the radio vs. direct path to your ear.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is especially crazy in terms of carbon footprint because most power in Iceland is generated renewably with zero carbon footprint. Almost certainly any ice from the USA ice plants is going to fossil fuel generated. So why then is Icelandic ice so expensive? One possibility is cost of labor involved in Iceland (no help there Ivarson); but there's a distinct possibility it is due to the higher cost of electrical power in iceland. Geothermal is clean but it took a lot of custom engineering to make it work. You can think of it as already paying carbon tax (since none of those carbon tax dollars helped fund that capital investment). The answer to this conundrum is those imported ice cubes should be taxed for their carbon footprint, and that money used to subsidize the geothermal industry. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Scientists have described several different orca populations in the areas off the Washington State and British Columbian coasts. The ones usually seen in the whale watching boats are known as "Resident" populations, are highly social and tend to interact with humans. They feed primarily on a limited species of Salmon. Two other groups are less social, one of which has been observed hunting sea lions as well as stealing salmon from fishermen's nets. They're less social and some fishermen have reportedly indicated they felt threatened or like they were being stalked. When spotted, these orca tend to move away, as if they know the  consequences of getting caught. It suggests that yes, they leave no survivors; but also they are careful not be witnessed either.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> On the gulf coast of Florida's panhandle, starting in about November and continuing into December, sometimes January, you see a lot of robins gathering along the coastline. It's weird because you don't think of robins in flocks, but that's what you see. Hundreds and hundreds of them lined up on park benches and dunes, looking out at the gulf. It's like they're waiting for a good northerly breeze or trying to get their nerve up. When the cold fronts start clocking across the country in the winter, they get that north wind. After the first big one hits, they're mostly gone but a few who have arrived late or didn't have the nerve hang around, sometimes all winter. They tend to disappear when spring comes around, I think catching a ride with first ones flying back up from their winter in ~~Costa Rica~~ Central America and the Caribbean   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Abortion was legalized in 1973. Most street crime is committed by people 15-25 year old (40% of all arrests). In 1985, a good percentage of the 15 year olds who would have been entering into their crime careers to replace those who were aging out, simply didn't exist. They had been aborted. The trend really kicked into gear in the early 90's as more than half of the street criminal prime ages had been subjected to being legally aborted. By 1998, an entire cohort of 15-25 year olds who would have been raised unwanted children simply didn't exist.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's a quote from an online [Thorium Reactor page:](https://whatisnuclear.com/articles/thorium_myths.html)  
Thorium reactors work by breeding Th-232 through Protactinium-233 (27.4 day half life) and into Uranium-233, which is fissile. Pa-233 is a pretty strong neutron absorber, so the MSBR (basically the LFTR) has to extract it from the core once it is produced and let it decay to U-233 away from the neutrons. Once the U-233 is created, it gets fed back into the reactor. Well, if you went rogue, you could build up a little excess reactivity (maybe add some low-enriched U235?) and then divert the freshly-bred U-233 into a weapons stream to make U-233 nuclear bombs. It may be difficult to do this several times without going subcritical, but it certainly could be done. A U-233-filled bomb has been tested before, and it worked just fine.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When you say Uranium and Plutonium, you're actually talking about specific isotopes, Uranium 235 (as opposed to the more abundant U-238) and Plutonium-239.  There are other isotopes of Uranium which could potentially be used to make bombs but typically have not been. U-233 is sometime cited as a bomb candidate material. It is produced as a by product of the supposedly safe "Thorium Fuel" reactor and undercuts the thorium reactor proponents argument that the technology is not a nuclear proliferation risk.

Does this mean that other giraffomorph species could potentially have populated wider ranges of the Eurasian continent?

Yet again, the man he shot apparently lived, although his wife died as a result of the accident. Was the cop charged in the wife's death? How did that work? Does the cop continue to face further charges from having shot the man who was driving the car? Is the person who was convicted of manslaughter actually the man driving the car (whose wife was killed), meaning the reddit article title is totally misleading? If this is the case, has the cop actually walked away scott free? What does that mean? Who was Scott, and what was he accused of? </TEXT>

In most of the world, megafauna that didn't meet these criteria have been mostly wiped out. Africa retains the most diverse sets of undomesticatable species, with numerous antelope and giraffe populations. Is there anything in phylogenetically to suggest why so many mega fauna species persist in Africa when they don't in other parts of the world

<TEXT> A recent paper that received news focus indicated giraffes, formerly considered a single species, were in fact four separate species. It seems the definition of what is and is not a species has blurred in recent years due to examination of genetic evidence. As an example there was recent move to delist the American red wolf as a species. This gives the impression species definition has become somewhat subjective. What are the objective criteria phylogenetics uses to declare a population as a separate species, or in the case of the red wolf, retract a species designation? </TEXT>

After Martin Cahill  the Irish gangster known as the General  stole 18 paintings from the Beit Collection at Russborough House in County Wicklow in 1986, the artworks led an extraordinary life. One painting was sent to Istanbul, where it was used as part of a payment for a heroin deal. Four other paintings  including a Gainsborough, a Goya and a Vermeer  were taken to Antwerp, where a diamond dealer accepted them as collateral and advanced Cahill a large sum of money, with which he tried to start an offshore bank in the Bahamas.

<TEXT> So we can talk about the speed of light and the time it takes for the light showing an event occurring until that light reaches the earth and our eyes. Your question could just as easily be applied to the sun. It takes light 8 minutes to get from the sun to the earth. So how do you know the sun didn't explode something less than 8 minutes ago and the light just hasn't reached us? The short answer is we don't. However a longer answer is that our studies of the sun and stars like our sun say they don't just all of a sudden explode. Most events of that scale don't happen, just all of a sudden, without producing precursor events or signs that they're going to happen. A couple people have cited Betelgeuse as a star that could have blown up and we don't know it yet. Betelgeuse is 642 light years away, and yes it could have blown up already and we don't know. It is producing some of those precursor signs that our studies say indicate an imminent supernove.  However, science also says it could also live as long as another several hundred thousand years, so the likelihood that it has happened in the past 641 is pretty low compared to the possible wait time </TEXT>

I remember from the Apollo project the astronauts left seismographs on the moon and for months afterwards there were reports of the Moonquakes; so I guess quakes without tectonics are possible. However, it prompts the question, what is the mechanism postulated for these hydrogen generating marsquakes to occur?   

The scientists examined special types of rocks that are created when rocks grind against each other during earthquakes. The samples the researchers analyzed from Scotland, Canada, South Africa, the Isles of Scilly off the coast of England and the Outer Hebrides of Scotland were up to hundreds of times richer in trapped hydrogen gas than surrounding rocks that were not generated from such grinding.  

Just because rocks exposed to Earthquakes are enhanced in hydrogen, it doesn't mean a similar process would occur on Mars because Mars wouldn't necessarily have the quakes, due to the lack of plate tectonics </TEXT>

<TEXT> Was in an elevator in hotel with 50 floors, room in 44th floor. Woman with two kids about 11 or 12 got on with me. They were going to 19th floor. As the door opened, one of the kids started punching buttons, just running his hand over the array. I stood there slack jawed for a second. The woman looked at me, shrugged and stepped off as the kid kept punch buttons. I drew back my leg and kicked him in the ass so hard I thought my ankle was broken. He flew out the elevator door and landed about 6 feet outside, already screaming before he hit the floor. The woman turned, looked and started striding back toward the elevator. I shrugged and smiled as the door closed before she could stick her hand in. Foot hurt all the way the remaining floors. Never felt pain so fine  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the corporate world there is a thing called Due Diligence and Governance. Agree calling HR general line is a dumb idea. Ethics hotlines, even if they are under HR, are a different story. Banking is a regulated activity. A bank's charter to operate is contingent on them operating on a lawful basis, and to have actual processes to seriously investigate reports of illegal activity in the bank. Of course this is all a crock of shit. It's the too big to fail principle at work again. Everyone keeps saying why doesn't Stumpf resign. But that's not the right question. The right question is why hasn't the DoJ charged Wells-Fargo with criminal fraud. People have said - what good will that do? the bank can't go to jail. No they can't, but they can lose their charter to operate as bank. They can be liquidated and sold off in parts to other banks. Every one says this should have happened in the 2008 financial melt down. In this case, the bank, and its management should have been on their toes for complete ethical compliance. Given that this is a second offense, the bank should get the death penalty.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> These are recently discovered (in the last 20 years or so) lightning phenomenon that are extremely short lived.  The physics of sprites (and an associated phenomenon called "Elves") is not completely understood but it is believed to be caused when the electrical charge on the top of thunder cloud discharges up into the ionosphere rather than to another cloud (cloud-to-cloud) or with the ground (cloud-to-ground) of ordinary lightning discharges. They are extremely short lived and so require very high speed cameras to catch. They happen so fast they're near the limit of human perception of detection </TEXT>

<TEXT> Outside the USA, beef, especially burger, tastes different, "gamey" is how I'd describe it similar to what I've tasted in my neighbor's venison burgers. I've heard this attributed to different butchering standards in other countries, including a less thorough draining of the blood from the carcass than in the US. Admittedly, my sample size is relatively small and it doesn't apply to all non-USA countries:  
Burgers taste like USA: Canada, Chile, Netherlands.  
Burgers taste like the cow was hunted and butchered in the woods: France, South Africa   Australia  
EDIT --  
UK burgers taste funny too - not quite to the level of Oz and SA, but maybe a little CJV spice

<TEXT> Considering how much China is building up their military and planning to be a "global power", have to wonder how they've concluded China's weapons count has remained in the 200s of so long. Back in the cold war we watched every nuclear reactor in the world, modeled how much plutonium was generated in each run, noted when the old fuel was unloaded/reloaded, etc. In an age when reactors and processing plants can be hidden inside of mountains, not really sure you can still use the same methods, or if it has the same attention it used to. An analysis group at Georgetown University concluded that China has way more ICBMs than they've declared (they keep theirs in tunnels inside mountains) based on some observed pattern of activity and number of holes. The "experts" all poo poo'ed their conclusions, but their analysis seemed to hold. If their missile count is as high as estimated, their nuclear weapons count would be up in the 1500 to 2000 range, and perhaps higher.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The galactic orbital speed of stars in galaxies would drop off with distance from the center of the galaxy if the dark matter distribution matched the mass distribution that we see from visible matter --e.g. stars and dust clouds. Another analogy is the orbital speeds of the planets around the Sun: Mercury orbits extremely quickly because it is close to the concentrated mass of the sun in the solar system. Each planet further out from the sun orbits correspondingly more slowly, because 99% of the solar system's mass is in the sun. The stars in galaxies don't follow this pattern. Instead they're all orbiting pretty close to the same speed regardless of their distance from the center. There is some variation with distance but not nearly what you'd expect to see from mass concentrations of visible matter. This is how Dark Matter was discovered. The only way to explain the velocity distribution of stars in galaxies is if the visible disc of the galaxy is itself embedded in a globular sphere of mass. It isn't necessarily a perfect sphere, but it must have its mass distributed semi uniformly across the volume -- ie not concentrated in a disk that trails off at the edges.  </TEXT>

He claimed that he just set his cruise control to 55 and drove in the left lane. Having encountered him on one occasion, can testify that he actively sped up and slowed down to maintain a road block with cars in the adjacent lanes and stymied people who attempted to zoom around him on the right.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Saw it on a science cast last night. The earth's orbital velocity is 43km/sec. To hit the sun you have to expend delta v of 43km/sec  to reverse your orbital speed so solar gravity will make you fall into the sun. Miscalculate only the slightest bit and you'll miss the sun and take an elliptical path past the sun. Delta v to achieve escape velocity from the solar system on the other hand is only 11 km/sec from the earth. You need 7 km/sec to break out of earth's gravity and just another 4 km/sec to escape the sun. Of course you're starting with 43 km/sec from the earth's speed, so the delta is only 4 km/sec more added on to it </TEXT>

<TEXT>  similar to photons, which are the carriers of the electromagnetic force   


So how exactly do photons "carry" electromagnetic force? We usually think and hear of photons being a quantum of light/energy that is picked up by a detector or causes an electron to be kicked into a higher energy orbital; but if I push the poles of two magnets together and feel them pull together or push apart, where are the photons? It's not like there is a laser shooting between those magnets. Similarly if I rub a ballon on my shirt and stick it on the wall with static electricity, where are the photons that are causing the force causing it to stick? What frequency are they vibrating? Are they radio, millimeter, infrared, UV, Xray or gamma? Somebody's got a lot of explaining to do

<TEXT> Actually we don't call one rotation a day. We call the time it takes for the sun to return to the same longitude/east-west position in the sky a "day". Since the Earth is orbiting around the sun, that position in the sky moves a little bit against the fixed background of stars. TLDR: a "day" is 4 ~~seconds~~ about 4 minutes longer than the time it takes the earth to rotate </TEXT>

<TEXT> Looks like the above was not completely accurate. The chemicals condense on the polar ice clouds, but are not active until they are activate by the return of sunlight in the late winter/early spring. The clouds act as traps, gathering the chemicals into high concentrations. Then, when the sun strikes the cloud, they are all photochemically activated and released into the atmosphere in a large pulse that catalytically reacts with ozone, although at that point, no longer on the surface of the ice crystals  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I heard the story second hand from my father who wasn't very sympathetic to feminist causes. I don't think they guys were so much saying "sure, show us your tits" as they were countering her position that they shouldn't be allowed to take off their shirts if she couldn't take off hers. I think technically they were all supposed to remain in uniform, but it had been custom going back more than a generation that mechanics working in the tropical heat could very well work on planes sitting in the sun bare chested. Clearly applying that custom to women, only recently integrated into this aspect of the military, would violate societal taboos. Basically the woman was saying, if there is a societal taboo against me going topless, none of you should be able to. Their response was "hey, it's technically against regs for any of us to strip down, do what you're comfortable doing".

<TEXT> To be specific, it is because the chemistry that depletes the ozone occurs on the surfaces of tiny ice crystals that only form in high enough concentrations at the altitude of the ozone layer during the late winter and early spring at the center of the polar vortex. In areas outside the center of the vortex the ice crystal are dispersed by the winds of the vortex, but in the center of the gyre, they tend to concentrate and form clouds. The ice crystals serve as a base on which ~~hydrofluorocarbon~~ Chlorofluorocarbon compounds condense and begin acting as a catalyst for the ozone depletion reaction. In effect, it forms a giant catalytic converter hundreds of miles wide, chewing up all the ozone that comes near it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is an effect on the ISS due to gravity gradient that does not apply on the ground or in "the middle of space". Due to the gradient in the gravity field over two points different distances from the center of earth's mass, the two points will have different orbital velocities, or more correctly, their natural velocities will be different. If the two points are connected in a single structure, like the ISS, the entire structure will orbit at the natural velocity at the altitude of its center of mass. But... Objects inside the structure at the extremes of distance from the center will still want to orbit at their natural velocities, with those lower to ground wanting to go faster and those furthest from the ground wanting to go slower. As a result, things in the ISS will tend to "fall" toward the center of mass of the ISS. The force acting on those objects is called "tides" </TEXT>

<TEXT> The typical police response that gets them off the hook is their monotone "I was in fear for my life". Often it is complete bullshit, but it suggests to me police are being trained to be fearful of a violent encounters for situations that are far rarer "in real police life" than their training would suggest. I was recently viewing articles published in "Police" magazine talking about how dangerous a traffic stop is for a cop, and the potential for them to be killed or injured. Checking the FBI statistics for law enforcement officer killing over the past 10 years, the numbers of LEOs killed on the job was fairly low, and until this year, declining. Of 54 officers killed in the line of duty in 2011 (from memory, so I could be off by a year or two), 4 were killed in a traffic stop, 2 of those were after high speed chases. Yet, the police training is suggesting this is very common/dangerous way to get killed on the job. It's like the parents that obsess over their kids getting abducted. In that case, they were doing shit like putting identity tags in false teeth and tattooing identifying marks on kids "just in case" they were abducted. In the case of police, they're drawing guns and one a hair trigger because they've been primed "black people are criminals who are going to kill you for no reason". These shootings are happening for a reason, and the reason is police training, that and a lot of implicit racism. When cops say "We're afraid too", you have to question - well why are you afraid? Isn't your fear unjustified in most cases? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Flying 530 am flight Houston thru Dallas after a night of margaritas and heavy duty jalapeo queso, I realize "man, I've got a shitstorm brewing". Land in Dallas and it's the Friday morning rush. Restrooms are packed. I mean cheek to flapping jowl, 3 deep waiting for a stall. My cheeks are clenched tighter than Fort Knox, knowing what's coming. Finally getting into the stall, the storm breaks with a massive microburst, burning everything it touches. Wipe, wipe then guts gurgle and another burning drip. Spatter, wipe repeat. Finally the end seems in sight. I become aware the bowl below me is so full of paper, it's almost touching my ass. Suddenly, the auto flush triggers. The wad of paper goes down and then clogs. The fluid level starts rising. What do I do? Should I shout out a warning? Time is of the essence. I grab my pants up, buckle my belt, snatch my computer bag and bolt out the door just as the sewage starts pouring over the edge of the bowl. Dashing into the dense crowd I hope no one can ID me as the perp. Behind me the doors of the two adjacent stalls burst open. A guy with his pants around his knees is hopping out dragging his bag. On the other side, a guy leaps out with toilet paper streamers hanging from his ass, leap frogging out of his stall. The crowd outside is still cheek to jowl. He falls over into crowd. People go down like bowling pins. I hear screams behind me over the sound of water pouring on the tiles. Run, don't look back.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> the original claim was laid out by the Republic of China--today known colloquially as Taiwan--**and was backed by the United States**  

Can you cite any specific actions the United States took to back the original claim. Everything I've ever seen claiming the US backed the claim was one of inaction --i.e. the fact that the US didn't fight the Chinese claim at the time is cited as US "support". China claims the US backed the claim in the past but has repudiated many US actions as the US attempting to be "the World's Policeman". If their position that US supported China's claim is based on the US not attacking it, then does that mean China recognizes the cases where the explicitly enforced international law?

<TEXT> In a layman's terms I think you just said that a spaceship or observer traveling at light speed (or extremely near c) would measure the speed of light and would determine its speed  to be c; but this measurement would only hold for photons in a nearby "bubble" that is within their inertial frame. You imply though, that if there is a mechanism by which the observer can measure the speed of a distant light ray, they will not see its speed at c, but will instead measure a different value.   
Are you describing another way of viewing the time dilatation effect of relativity? Consider a light ray passing from point a to point b where a and b are connected by a line perpendicular to your velocity. Say for example Point A is a star that went supernova after you passed it and Point B is a nearby molecular cloud you also passed. The cloud lights up from the supernova. Are you saying that an observer seeing first the supernova, then the light of the supernova illuminating the molecular cloud would see an elapsed time between the two events suggesting a light speed different from c?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gary Kleck, a Florida State University criminologist who is the source of a debunked claim that critics say dramatically exaggerated the frequency of defensive gun use, recently served on a committee tasked by the federal government with creating a potential research agenda focusing on ways to minimize gun violence  

Kleck is best known for his 1995 study with Marc Gertz that claims that up to 2.5 million incidents of defensive gun use occur every year. ...Critics point to the study's "serious methodological difficulties" -- it extrapolates a very rare event, the slightly more than one percent of respondents to a survey that said they had used a gun in self-defense over the past year, to the entire population of 200 million adults. This means that even slight deficiencies in the accuracy of the survey, whether due to false positives or a sample that is not perfectly indicative of the overall population, can lead to large differences in the result. Harvard Injury Control Research Center Director David Hemenway has labeled Kleck's result "an enormous overestimate" and pointed out that the results require one to believe, for instance, that "burglary victims use their guns in self-defense more than 100% of the time."

The democratic process has been completely suborned by dictatorship and the country appears to be spiraling into an armed conflict, if not genocide. ~~Columbia~~ Colombia, while it has its share of problems has a rising economy and is considered in a transition from a developmental to industrialized economy. ~~Brazil~~ Brasil is rated higher (or lower in risk), yet their government is in turmoil with the president impeached, widespread lawlessness, and a collapsing economy.   </TEXT>

Radio had the hurricane accelerating toward the coast and the first storm bands were less than two hours away. They figured it was better to be in their home than stuck out on the road when the storm came. Storm was pretty bad, lots of property damage, but they came through ok. House intact. In subsequent storms, they've evacuated 3 times, stayed 4 or 5 times. Major factor in evacuation is strength of the storm and consistency of predicted landfall. When prediction is jumping around, its hard to make the call. In at least one of the evacuations, they drove 8 hours inland only to have the storm hit 800 miles away.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's been years since I've had to do any of the math associated here, but am questioning the lack of discussion of wire resistance due to gauge vs induced impedance once the magnetic field establishes itself. I work in IT and sometime have to do peak and average power consumption for data center racks. Anything with motors in it (like disk drives and server fans) has an initially high power surge as the current runs  into the motor coils (ie solenoids) which initially has no magnetic field. Once the magnetic field is established, the resistance of the solenoid is going to go up, establishing higher resistance and power dissipation, and lower current.  I'm pretty sure there are a number of tertiary effects due to that peak to average current transition, including mechanical ad thermal shocks. I have to believe the wire gauge is going to have an effect on that transition

He acknowledges the atrocities of the fascists under Mussolini but doesn't feel their tactics were really very different from most European governments at the time. He feels similarly about the Americans and their liberation of Italy, pointing out a case of the American destruction of medieval monastery held by the Germans. Apparently there was an agreed non-combat status for the monastery during the stalemate in winter of 1944 lines. The Germans used it for an artillery observation post and the American's bombed it to smithereens. He views this as an American war crime, not the Germans abusing the argeed ceasefire terms.  

Bottomline is that he doesn't feel any particular national guilt for the actions of the fascists under Mussolini as he sees the Fascist part of his own society as much the enemy </TEXT>

Most of these programs have actually been directed at learning about the animals' behavior with the physical data being a side benefit. Do you see marine mammals being recruited directly as geophysical data collection platforms?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually I do like art and I think it has a place in a well rounded curriculum but I wonder at the actual motivation for making STEM into STEAM. To me it comes across as a way of making STEM less exclusive. A valid rationalization would be, I think adding aesthetics into technology design and improving communication. I've seen articles about teaching science grad students creative writing to help them "tell a better story" in their technical writing. I'd really like to see someone working in STEAM articulate the goals of including Art rather than it just being a form of non-nerd affirmative action.   </TEXT>

Can you talk about the rationale for injecting Art in the mix and how it complements the overall educational content of the traditional STEM subjects? STEM was originally about encouraging students to learn skills that would enable them to become the inventors and business innovators of the future. Can you give some examples of how the STEM approach was less effective because it didn't include Art? Can you provide some examples where the inclusion of Art has improved the effective application of the more traditional technical subjects?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This caution is largely directed toward drinking stream/spring water from  "wild places" like national parks, national forests, state parks, etc. People think of them as pristine but in many cases they have been subjected to a lot of both human and domesticated animal traffic:   Think horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, mules, llamas. All of these animals can spread communicable diseases through their feces. In many cases it may not actually be in the parkland itself, but instead in streams flowing in from privately held or government lands subject to grazing leases. In National Parks there have been years of backpackers pooping in the woods. Dogs used to be frequent and still are present in some national parks. Giardia is going to be the most common concern, but cholera and e coli contamination are other possibilities.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My point was though, if you were to accelerate a small asteroid say one that massed 100 million tonnes to a speed some gnats eyelash removed from c, its relativistic mass would be huge, perhaps rivaling the rest mass of the Earth. However, its gravitational field/attraction of other objects would still be the same as when it was at rest: 100 million tonnes. The relativistic mass, while present for the purposes of kinetic energy calculations in case of impact, would not distort space-time to create a gravity well equivalent to the Earth's.

<TEXT> The [largest ship in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelude_FLNG) is being built in South Korea. It is destined to be a floating industrial plant to liquefy natural gas from the recently developed gas field off the Australian northern coast. Seems like a lot of investment building a whole industrial plant on a giant ship instead of just piping the gas back to Australia. So why are they doing that? Because, if they brought the gas back to the Australian shore, they'd be obligated to pay Australians, at Australian labor rates and benefits in the plant. The natural gas is Australian, the government gets some kind of royalty cut for the gas extraction, but that resource isn't otherwise serving Australia. They're building that ship so the plant can be worked by Chinese, or other very low cost labor. Welcome to the future where our governments have been bought by corporations and billionaires to serve their needs and not the needs of the country  </TEXT>

<TEXT> the faster you push the object (nucleus, person, planet, black hole, etc) the deeper it digs into the sheet and now the more space-time it is "displacing" (warping), or as the equations predict: the atom acts like a more and more massive object, displacing more and more space-time. Essentially, wouldn't this lead to a larger magnitude gravity wave? (I'm seriously asking.)   

Thought about this recently, may have even asked an AskScience question.  My question was something like "If a relativistic speed object passed through the solar system without hitting anything, wouldn't it still disrupt planetary orbits as its massive gravity well traversed across the solar system".  
It didn't get much traction but I googled some more and found the wikipedia article on [Mass in Special Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_in_special_relativity). Apparently the upshot is that space-time is distorted by the rest mass of an object, but does not create further distortions by the increased relativistic mass. If you think about, this makes sense because relativistic speed objects would tend to generate gravity waves as "wakes" when they moved through a vacuum.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A robbing situation is also pretty interesting to watch. The robbing bees will attempt a fast entry into the hive, often intercepted on the way in by a guard bee. When there is full blown robbing going on, you'll see pairs or triples of bees grappled onto each other struggling and rolling around like gang members in fight. Additional robbers can be seen streaking into the hive entrance, not bothering to land, but instead flying in and penetrating the crowd inside. It is for this reason, during robbing season people tend to put gates on their hives. Bees cant flight straight in or out. They have to go through a narrow gap or make a couple 90 degree turns. This prevents the "fly right in scenario", forcing them to crawl up and allowing guards time to respond.

<TEXT> Fat loss with a pill or prescription.  We all have "brown fat" tissues in varying degrees. Mostly we have it as babies but it deactivates as we get older. Brown fat metabolizes stored body fat (yellow fat) directly into body heat without having to be converted into sugars and consumed in muscle exertion. Chances are the skinny guy or girl you know who never wears a coat when it is cold outside and can eat like a pig without gaining weight has a mutation where their brown fat is turned on all the time. Scientists are decoding the metabolic pathways that can turn on brown fat. Eventually they will produce a drug that can turn on your brown fat.

<TEXT> It depends - we have been doing weather forecasts for more than a century  using sparse data measurements from scattered stations to project temperatures across broad swaths of the continents. With the advent of more comprehensive satellite measurements, the accuracy of those models has been refined and confirmed. The comprehensive global temperature records uses those sparse records and modern models the project. They've also used other data sources like tree ring data and oxygen isotope ratios in glacier ice cores to validate and refine temperatures over a  broader areas; but when you get down to it, the older comprehensive dataset is going to be a projection based on weather models with sparse data points providing "ground truth". People with a preconceived notion that global warm is a lie will make the claim that unless you have validated ground truth for every point on the earth, it can't be trusted to be true. Many of these same people will also put extreme faith in things like "Tax cuts for the rich are good for everyone" - that are similarly based on models with limited "ground truth".

One thing that is a valid criticism is what is baseline should be used as "the average" against which individual years are measured? The further back you go, the more scatter/diffuse the data points used to project the global average. A lot of this information comes from the logs of British Naval vessels from the 17th and 18th centuries. These sparse datasets then have to be used to model the temperature elsewhere on the globe based on measurements at various locations on the oceans and limited colonial stations </TEXT>

Clearly the answer the gun advocates had teed up, ready to state wasn't a suggestion for stringent gun registration. Yet, in the parallel you draw to gun ownership, child molesters are registered and must continue to be identified as such wherever they go, even after release from prison.  Some would say theres a very strong parallel, in terms of potential future  danger to society, between gun owners and sexual predators. Strict registration and monitoring is the answer in the latter case but somehow the parallel never seems to also be a viable solution for the former </TEXT>

**Compton Gamma Ray Observatory** named for American Physicist Arthur Holly Compton. Winner of 1927 Nobel Prize in Physics. Discovered the particle nature of electromagnetic Radiation.  

**Hubble Space Telescope** named for American Astronomer Edwin Hubble. Discovered the Milky Way is just one galaxy among countless billions. Discovered galactic redshifts and consequently realization the universe is expanding.  

**Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope** named for Italian Physicist Enrico Fermi, Winner of 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics, inventor of the nuclear reactor. Posed the Fermi Equation for the probability of extraterrestrial life. 

**Chandra Xray Observatory** named for Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar Indian American astrophysicist, winner of 1983 Nobel Prize for Physics for studies in Stellar Evolution. The Chandrasekahr Limit which determines the mass above which a star will collapse into a Black Hole is also named for him. 

**Planck Telescope** named for German Physcist Max Planck, winner of the 1918 Nobel Prize in Physics for development of Quantum Theory. 

**ESA Herschel Space Observatory** Named for British Astronomer Sir William Herschel, discovered planet Uranus, studied and characterized nebulae as distinct objects from stars and planets

**Spitzer Infrared Telescope** named for Lyman Spitzer American Astronomer and Astrophysicist. Studied  the interstellar medium/dust and its formation into stars. Invented the concept of a large scale space based telescope that eventually became the Hubble. 

**James Webb Observatory** named for James Webb who  
1) executive assistant to O. Max Gardner, Under Secretary of the Treasury  
2) director of the Bureau of the Budget for Truman then  
3) Under Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State.   
4) Returned to Washington in 1961 for Kennedy as Administrator of NASA.  

For seven years after Kennedy's lunar landing announcement James Webb politicked, coaxed, cajoled, and maneuvered for NASA in Washington. As a longtime Washington insider he was a master at bureaucratic politics. In the end, through a variety of methods Administrator Webb built a seamless web of political liaisons that brought continued support for and resources to accomplish the Apollo Moon landing on the schedule President Kennedy had announced  

Has it really come to this? We are naming our next great telescope after a *bureaucrat*?  

Isn't there a science of great of the late 20th or early 21st who can be honored and inspirational to a new generation of the budding astronomers? Marc Aaronson,  Rychard Bouwens, Carolyn Porco? 

Come on people, do you really want kids looking at the beautiful images from this telescope for the next 20 years looking up James E Webb for their inspiration to get into science?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You joke but most people don't realize in the "How Washington Really Works", most federal agencies have a parallel management structure similar to parliamentary democracies.  The US constitution says the president runs the executive branch and appoints/nominates leaders for agencies. In a parliamentary democracy, the party with the majority that "forms the government" appoints specific legislators to manage different agencies. However, in the US constitution, Congress must appropriate money for government spending. In effect this means the money to run the agencies. They're also given a loosely defined "oversight" authority. As a result, every federal agency has two or three congressional representatives who own oversight and budget authority for their agency. They meet regularly with the senior managers for the agency, and often put unpublished pressure on the agency "If you publish this report, I'll cut your budget so far you'll be mopping floors to make ends meet" etc. So, to answer the question, Paul Ryan is the prime minister of the US. However he shares some of that power with Mitch McConnell </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cavitation is a result of the pressure drop over the "wing" --i.e. blade of the propeller dropping below the boiling point of water flowing across the blade. When the water starts to boil, the bubble disrupt the flow creating intense turbulence. The water then returning to the normal pressure after it has crossed the blade, causing the bubbles formed in the boiling to implode, which in turn creates shock waves. It is the shockwaves from those collapsing bubbles that carry sound so far underwater from cavitation </TEXT>

<TEXT> The US JSF F-35 is noisy as all get out - louder than any of the planes I ever heard growing up on air force bases around the country. Unlike the stealth helicopters which have sound suppression, stealth fighters are pretty much all electronic stealth. As a result of that stealth, they're supposed to be flying up 10K or higher because they don't have to worry about radar. You might be able to tell they're in the area from the sound, but the area you can hear them over is 30 or 40 miles wide.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So would be helpful to have a level headed Turk give a reasoned argument why the Turkish government cares so much. The events which some call a genocide and the Turks argue wasn't one occurred when the country that is now Turkey called itself The Ottoman Empire. That country was dismembered into parts of Syria, Iraq, Romainia, Macedonia Palestine Lebanon, Greece, Cyprus, Georgia and Armenia during and at the end of WW I. The country Turkey was formed by a revolutionary government from the remaining rump territory of the empire.  It can easily be disavowed as the acts of an overthrown government of a now nonexistant country. Why should modern day Turkey care? By protesting so much, it gives very much the perception that Turks today have something to hide.

Individuals seeking to have the sex change surgery have to live as the opposite gender for multiple years before a physician can perform the surgery. During that time they take hormones, live, dress and interact socially as their identified gender; and while in that state, are considered to trans. I know this only from a transgender display in Trinidad Colorado which is apparently a sex change capital in the USA. Caitlin Jenner for example is considered trans, yet has not completed the full monty so to speak, and recently has expressed doubts as to whether they will go through with it, perhaps even going back to being a man.  </TEXT>

--EDIT--  
Hmm, accumulating some downvotes here, but no comments countering. If you have reason to disagree (e.g., I'm from the middle east and this is SO not true.), I'd love to hear it. Was definitely part of cultural training. If the company giving that training was full of shit (so to speak), would love to know what this gesture actually means in your culture, and whether or not people actually use it.

<TEXT> An interesting feature in the early documentation for the LHC data collection system struck me: the detectors produce data far faster than any networking and storage system can capture. The designs included a component that examined events from the detectors for "interestingness" and discarded a larger part of the data from the detectors before it was ever stored. Does that feature still exist in the LHC data collection system? If so, how are "interesting events" determined? Are those parameters changed for different runs of the LHC? What were the criteria used for the data included your data release? How do you know new physics hasn't been thrown out with the discarded data?   </TEXT>

By the time the spanish explorers were first coming through the region, they'd been decimated by plagues, with estimated population reduction of 90%.

<TEXT> Genomics has branched out into a lot of fairly different, distinct areas including whole genome analysis of individuals within a species, populations of individuals across a species and comparison of one species to another. There is also the study of active vs deactivated genes in different tissues and with different disease states. For example in recent years, they've been studying the genes active in different types of cancer. In medicine today cancer is treated on the basis of what tissue it originated in. When cancer has metastasized to other tissues of the body, it retains the genetics that it had in the tissue where it arose. Recent work has demonstrated that cancers of several different origin tissues are related and have common elements, but other cancers are so different they should probably be classified as completely different diseases. Finally, and more to the point, the genetics are only a small part of the picture. Genes encode RNA which encodes and makes proteins but some RNA turns around activates other genes, or suppresses the activity of already active genes. Proteins interact with each other. Some of them bind with DNA to promote or suppress its expression. To say the study of genomics has slowed isn't accurate, but what has happened is that it has been realized is the operation of the machinery of the cell is far more complicated than anyone ever imagined.

<TEXT> A friend told me about a bar in Cancun where there were lots of monkeys in the trees above the deck. There were lots and lots of signs about not feeding the monkeys, but sure enough somebody in their group gave a monkey that came to the table some of his fries. The monkey loved them and kept asking for more. Finally the guy figured he was going eat his meal, turned away from the monkey and started eating the fries himself. The monkey jumped on his head and started pulling his hair out while screeching and baring his teeth at the other patrons. Everyone jumped back from the table, leaving their meals. Monkeys swarmed out of the trees, grabbing everyone's meals and running off.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Put this also in perspective for the lead up to the invasion of Iraq which the neocons in the Bush administration had been pushing since even before 9/11. The US needed staging for the invasion. While I disagree with some others in this thread that the 9/11 attacks were official policy of the Saudi government, one needs to understand how thoroughly compromised the Saudi governmental organizations are with religious extremists.  The suppression of the 28 pages and termination of follow up investigations into the Saudi officials who provided logistical support for the attacks was almost certainly a quid pro quo for permission to make limited use of the Saudi bases in the Iraq invasion  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Amazing how this is getting played. Pedestrian ramps on curbs were put there for a reason: largely for handicap access to and from the street. It can be argued that they're not just for handicap access, but a way to prevent complete blockage of sidewalk to street access. Any reasonable "common law" interpretation of a car parking to block one of these access points would be "That's illegal, blocking a pedestrian access". The thing that made this not illegal was apparently some local pol in NYC having his constituents say, "there's not enough parking and we have to give up 3 fucking feet of potential parking space for all those goddamn ramps for cripples!" So, the result was to pass a law saying it wasn't a legal pedestrian access point unless there's a crosswalk painted on the pavement. Probably a lot of them originally did have crosswalks, but with the constrained budgets, you repave the road, not enough money to go restripe the cross walk. I personally am glad every one of those people who were ticketed, got those tickets. I am glad anyone who paid those tickets, won't get their money back. I hope some police, especially the ones who know those pedestrian access points are used and needed by some people will continue to write those tickets even though some slimy politician has slipped a loop hole in ADA access in NYC  </TEXT>

It is also against the law, and in having the ticket dropped, indicts the credibility of the original issuing officer: the implication is the ticket was improperly issued. If this was the case, then anyone else issued a ticket by the same officer can very well claim there is evidence of incompetence or malfeasance by the same officer. </TEXT>

Driving around the beltway, he demanded that his handlers pull off at random exits and then drive until they found a supermarket which he'd run into to "surprise" the staff. Seeing the produce in the front, he'd rush to back trying to catch them suddenly putting out meat and dry goods that weren't there before he came into the store.

<TEXT> The paper explores several different possibilities, but they have demonstrated the viability and explanation of what is considered a major anomaly of our solar system as compared to exo-planetary systems that have been studied: The vast majority of other planetary systems include a "Super-Earth" in the inner system. Our solar system doesn't have one. We also have solar system evolution models to explain the orbits of our currently known planets (the Nice Model) which has Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus moving pretty far from their formation positions, and interacting with each other in gravitational resonances to enhance those movements. Those same resonances could also result in an additional planet involved in the mix getting a very big gravitational boost to put it into a much higher and eccentric orbit than the major planets of the solar system. The important finding of this paper is that this is indeed a viable scenario given the current state of the solar system's planets. The also looked at other scenarios of an exoplanet capture, but my reading of the article is that these are considered to be possible, but much lower probability than the inner system planet ejection theory </TEXT>

<TEXT> Enron had branched into non-energy business areas before their total collapse. I work for a large IT / computer services company. In the weeks before their collapse I was responding to an RFP and had meetings at the Enron building Houston over their plan to broker online storage services. We were going to build an internet accessible storage system - e.g. Amazon S3  like capability. Enron had specifications for 100 GB blocks of storage (no small volume in the mid 1990's) that would be purchased for 1 month terms of service. They had some pretty onerous terms of service but it was basically a "Buy Low, Sell High" strategy. They wanted to setup a brokerage for storage services that mirrored the electrical energy they were already offering (and manipulating the energy market in some areas like California). We understood they were moving this some business area in numerous other areas. In many ways it was the cloud that AWS, Google, Microsoft etc all operate today, except Enron had no intention of actually setting up any of the cloud services. Instead they wanted to set themselves up as the exclusive provider that everyone had to go through to contract for those services.

Next year I took an independent study lab and accidentally spilled that mercury in a lab room. Clean up as much as I could but about 1/3 of it, say 1 tablespoon was still missing in the end. A few years ago a local high school was closed for fucking month and a half when some kids broke the mercury switch from an old thermostat in the hall way. There was maybe 1/4 tsp of mercury in that switch. They had a hazmat team in there and special chemical spill cleanup contractor before they'd let kids back into the school. I think about that when I'm back in my home town.

<TEXT> You might be interested in the 1980 protocol for incendiary weapons addition to the [Geneva Conventions](http://www.weaponslaw.org/assets/downloads/1980_CCW_Prot_III.pdf).  

It has the following definitions and explicit exclusions. I've annotated some elements such as the exclusion of smoke, tracer and signaling systems. Also annotated the section regarding weapons that contain incendiary material but are not designed to explicitly burn individual humans.  

1. "Incendiary weapon" means any weapon or munition 
which is primarily designed to set fire to objects 
or to cause burn injury to persons through the action
 of flame, heat, or combination thereof, produced 
by a chemical reaction of a subs
tance delivered on the target.   
 
(a)
Incendiary weapons can take the form of, for example, flame throwers, fougasses, shells, rockets, 
grenades, mines, bombs and other containers of incendiary substances.  
 
(b)
Incendiary weapons **do not** include: 
(i) Munitions which may have incidental incendiary effects, such as **illuminants, tracers, smoke or signalling systems;** 
(ii) Munitions designed to combine penetration, blast or fragmentation effects with an additional incendiary effect, such as armour-piercing projectiles, fragmentation shells, explosive bombs and similar combined-effects munitions **in which the incendiary effect is not specifically designed to cause burn injury to persons,** but to be used against military objectives, such as armoured vehicles, aircraft and installations or facilities.   

In the battle for faluja in Iraq, the UK's Guardian newspaper made a claim similar to yours above - that phosphorus munitions were banned by the geneva convention. This is not the case. Munitions design to burn people are banned, but munitions that have phosphorus in them, design for illumination or as explosives against military installations are not banned.  </TEXT>

So there are two different ways that scenario could play out, one of which I would call "fake", another I would not. 

If there was a picture of the Earth, taken from a completely different point in time and location in orbit from a picture of the moon's surface from a low light angle; and these two photos were merged to make it appear as if it was an Earthrise moment on the Moon's terminator, then yes I would call this photo fake. On the other hand, if the LRO was taking a series of photos covering the low light angle landscape on the moon, then took more images of the earth above the horizon at a different exposure, this would be a valid representation  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Although the comments already here are accurate --e.g. lack of tectonic plate movement means eruptions over time are in the same place and low rate of erosion means the mountains stay high instead of being worn down -- there is another factor to consider. If you measure mountains not in terms of their absolute height but instead with the height expressed as a ratio of the planetary diameter, Olympus Mons is not the highest mountain in the solar system. It actually comes in 9th, behind three volcanoes on Mars, Ahuna Mons on Ceres, and the peaks on several of Saturn's moons, most of which were created by large impacts relative to the size of the body being hit. The list of the tallest mountains in the solar system is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_mountains_in_the_Solar_System) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have to question the bias, intended or unconscious, embodied in what is being classified as an 'IS Terror Attack". Note for example the UK does not appear in the list of countries with casualties, but can think of two incidents off the top of my head which were either IS directed or IS inspired attacks: Beheading of Lee Rigby and the Leytonstone tube station knife attacks. One might claim there is tenuous proof of IS involvement in both these cases, but looking at the claimed 42 casualties in the US, it is easy to see some of these are the people killed at shot by the San Bernadino couple, but 42? Who else are you counting? Maybe the two guys who tried to shoot up the Mohammed cartoon contest in Dallas and were themselves killed? Another apparent "message" of the statistics is one of "look how bad Iraq has it". So 3633 killed in Iraq but only 609 in Syria? Really? Deaths alone in Syria are over 100,000 never mind injuries,  from all sides. How can you say only 609 directly attributable to IS? If you're saying, oh but in Syria, it is really a civil war and therefore not a "Terror" attack, then how do you justify your Iraq numbers? There are just too many inconsistencies and apparent "messaging" in this graphic to take it seriously as valid data analysis presentation </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's say the space station is directly above you.  

While you don't say how far above you, Larry Niven had a great mnemonic for non-technicals living in a weightless orbiting environment ("The Smoke Ring"):  

East takes you Out, Out takes you West, West takes you In, In takes you East  

Basically, if you're in a lower orbit than the space station, it is above you, but would be falling behind you because your lower orbit means you're moving fasting. By throwing a rock behind you along your line of orbit, it would increase your velocity toward the East which orbital mechanics would immediately convert into a higher, but slower orbit. Throw enough rocks, you'd rise the space station's orbital altitude, but likely not at the same point along the orbit as the space station. If you threw a few more rocks, you could rise above the space station's orbit and let it catch up with you. Then throw a rock forward along your orbital vector (pushing you to the West) to lower your orbit down to the space station. All this presumes you and the station are in orbits with same eccentricity and inclination AND none of your rock throwing velocity vectors changed them. Otherwise you could get yourself completely out of sync with the station and likely only rarely seeing each other.

<TEXT> There are a couple aspects to the problem. One is sensory and the other is perceptual. In a sense we have already created numerous machines that allow people to "see" new and different colors. Radiologists reading xray and CT images are "seeing" the effect of xrays passing through tissue or other matter. MRIs - they're seeing the radiowaves emitted by tissues stimulated with magnetic resonance. Nuc Med Gamma camera images, they're "seeing" gamma rays, PET scan images they're "seeing" 511 keV photons characteristic of matter/antimatter annilation (not even sure what that part of the spectrum is called). In all these cases, humans are able to "see" these colors by shifting them into the visible light spectrum in which our visual system operates. A similar process goes on in most of those beautiful Hubble spaceporn images everyone loves.    

As /u/Karmaslapp indicates, there are also some people who have a genetic variation giving them sensory apparatus in the eye to see additional frequencies of higher than the blue pigment sensor most of us see. The end result is that they can distinguish a great granularity of shades of blue and purple when test images are shown to an experimental population; but conceptually are they really seeing a new color? 

Color perception, like sound, like smell, like taste are all artifacts of our conscious or unconscious minds.  You can do objective tests to determine whether two different people continue to see graduations of the color purple as higher frequency hues are added; but we have no way of knowing whether at some point they see something that is no longer purple but is a new color as different from purple as say, green. This would be mental construct. Unless there's some way to communicate mind to mind, we have only our agreed upon language to say  "That color is purple", "ooh look thatone is an even deeper hue of purple"

Saw an essay some years ago projecting the King Kong's penis size proportionally from his giant size as compared to current mountain gorillas. The answer was something like 12 or 13 inches, proving that Kong and Fay Wray were physically compatible. Her affection for the beast by the end of the movie can therefore be summed up in the well known saying

<TEXT> One suspects OP's question was directed along the lines of "Can concrete be recycled back into powdered form which can be mixed and cast into new structures". Considering concrete is made from an energy intensive process which produces copious quantities of CO2 driven off from the raw materials; AND, the process of setting concrete is an exothermic reaction that releases significant heat energy, one suspects the answer to my restated version of the question is "Not without significant input of energy and additional chemical reagents to reverse the chemical processes that occurred in setting the concrete originally. Even with these caveats, it is unclear whether there is in fact a reversible process which could restore old concrete to it's status as a raw material for pouring new concrete. Can you comment on this aspect of concrete recycling?

<TEXT> Actually I don't and am a bit out of date. I worked in medical imaging and consulted in a number of government funded healthcare countries. Advanced medical imaging is capital intensive that doesn't work well with government allocated funding acquisition processes (as compared to market economy healthcare). Britain and Canada in particular were far behind in the number of advanced technology imaging machines per capita compared to countries like the US. Yes the imaging in the UK is free but if it takes you 2 months to get the exam, is it really serving your needs. I don't have specific individual stories, but did have statistics on waiting times for exams. These ranged from 4 to 9 weeks in the UK about 9 years ago. Given the cuts in the NHS recently, I can't imagine the situation has gotten any better.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  do people just believe that cops start their day thinking that they are going to go out and find any reason to kill someone?

No, but people do believe that cops decide to kill people during arrests, not in self defense, but in anger at defiance of their authority. Cops who beat unresisting suspects while shouting "stop resisting" are showing premeditation for the assault crime they are committing. Cops who step into the path of a car speeding away from a scene even as they start firing through the windshield and claim self defense against a vehicle used as a deadly weapon are demonstrating a willful intent to use deadly force rather than allowing a criminal to escape from a $17 waffle house bill. Cops who use tasers are on hand cuffed suspects laying on the ground are committing torture in retaliation for verbal or physical abuse the suspects dealt to them or their colleagues.   

Do I believe you go out looking for someone to kill every day? No, but I think you lack the social constraints that normally inhibits people in society from using physical violence and lethal force for what you perceive to defiance. The fact that there are violent criminals out there who will hurt police officers seems to the be the entire justification for police officers torturing or killing people for minor crimes. It is not that we think police officers shouldn't be allowed to defend themselves. Instead it is your belief that you can kill someone you encounter who shows the slightest resistance arrest, often for minor crimes.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a very intense pre-surgical planning phase for liver transplants both for the donor and recipient. The liver has a very complex network of both blood vessels and billiary ducts. While it just looks a really big lump in the simplistic major organ charts, the liver actually consists of multiple separate lobes interconnected in a branching tree structure similar to the structure people often visualize for the branching bronchial tubes within the lungs. The liver typically consists of three or four separate lobes, with common connection point pretty close to the bottom of the tree trunk base. Here's a [link to an image](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4176786/figure/F10/)  from surgical planning system that is being used to map the internal vascular structure of a donors liver. The surgeons will identify one lobe that they will remove from the donor at the base of it's major trunk and plan where they have to suture off the connecting passages and vessels.  This whole lobe will then be transplanted, connecting it up the recipient's blood vessels and billiary tracts. The donor will grow a new lobe or increase the sizes of his remaining lobes. The recipient will do something similar with their new healthy lobe transplanted in.   </TEXT>

It is that she was executed by a police officer. The claim that officer felt a threat to his life is simply not credible for someone who with his job role, physical capabilities and training/experience. It is clear he felt empowered to be both judge and executioner of a petty criminal given the slightest opening for a legal excuse. People who applaud this action, saying "she had just committed a crime": look yourself in the mirror and say " I approve of traffic police executing people exceeding the speed limit".  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you look at the history of prosecution of police officers vs  the criminal charges against ordinary citizens, the same standard of "can you prove it" doesn't seem to apply. Looking the list of charges against the people Obama just commuted sentences against almost all, perhaps, all (I didn't read the details on every one) were charged with "Conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute". So how do you prove intention for criminal behavior that the suspects didn't even do?  You're right in that prosecutors seem to pull the punches with charges against police officers. There are high hurdles to get them charged with crimes in the first place, an apparent higher burden of proof than ordinary citizens, and a judiciary that seems to bend over backwards looking for reasons to acquit or dismiss charges. If by chance you happen to get a prosecutor that actually works at convicting a police officer and judge who's willing to dismiss the really really incredible defense arguments, it always seems there is yet another judge on an appeal who will accept these incredibly thin arguments. Two cases bear out this latter case. The police officers who shot and killed refugees trying to leave New Orleans after Katrina had their incredibly kid glove "manslaughter" convictions reverse on appeal. In Maryland, police officers who testified they'd been assaulted by a retired judge's son before they nearly beat him to death were convicted of perjury when their testimony was shown to be false in recorded video. Yet, on appeal, their convictions were reversed on a technicality that they shouldn't have been the one testifying in the first place. Both cases illustrate the example that if you're going to get reversed anyway, you might as well throw the book at the officer for murder or assault. That way when the corrupt judge goes to reverse the conviction, they'll have to be explicit about ignoring evidence rather than using some very grey detail about paperwork.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a great answer and appreciate your detail. There is one aspect you haven't covered that I wonder if you have information on. I've seen in others and experienced myself upon sudden cold water immersion an effect that seemed to be a diaphram muscle spasm making it difficult to breathe. The sensation is not unlike getting a body blow and "having the wind knocked out of you". In one instance a friend and I were moving a sailboat in winter when a sudden gust caused the boat to capsize. My friend went into the water while I was able to climb to the high side without getting wet. He literally lay on the gunwhale of the boat gasping, unable to breathe in for half a minute. When the boat came back up and his body was pulled from the water, he was slowly able to start taking successively deeper breaths. Is the diaphram spasm also part of the vasocontriction effect?

<TEXT> My dad was a fighter pilot in the USAF. When I was a kid and relatives would visit, he would take us all out to the flightline and we'd climb up in the cockpit of the aircraft/stand on the boarding ladder while he told us about various stuff. The cockpit always had 4 or 5 levers or pull mechanisms that were painted in a black and yellow "barber stripe" pattern. These were all the ejector seat triggers. They were in different places because if you're in a tumble or spin or roll the gee forces are going to be all different possible directions, they wanted to make sure you never had to reach more than a few inches to grab one of these. On the ground every one of those levers/mechanisms had a pin stuck through it with red streamer tag labeled "Explosive". They were making damn sure somebody's sleeve didn't get caught on one so it got pulled accidentally. Some time around 1970, dad stopped being able to take family out to the flight line to checkout the planes. Apparently on some base somewhere, some pilot's asshole brother-in-law didn't believe there were really explosives in the ejector seat. He pulled the tag pin out of the handle and yanked it. The explosive bolts blowing the chair free killed the pilot who was standing on the boarding ladder instantly. The brother-in-law, who was sitting in the seat, but not strapped in, got launched a good portion of the 800 feet the ejector seat rocket lifted up off the tarmac. However, he did separate from the chair, so he came plummeting down like he'd fallen off a skyscraper while a parachute brought the chair down somewhat gently onto the airfield.   </TEXT>

It also appears to have structure with a bright initial point spreading out when it reaches some maximum altitude. That said, the galilean moons to the right of the planet appears smeared out as if some kind of jpeg block artifact expanded their size as part of the DCT transform. I have a related question though. The bright patch definitely seems to expand outward and then collapse, but it does so in less than a second. What would we actually be seeing in that case? Would superheated gases from the collision propagate up through the atmosphere for a distance on par with the diameter of the earth in a half of a second? Or are we seeing a shockwave move upward, and where the shockwave passes the local gases are compressed/shocked to the point of incandescence? </TEXT>

Complicating factors are Broads patent is for more extensive IP than what was claimed in Cal's; but at the very least Broad's patent should have been more narrowly granted. Because it was so broadly granted and then licensed, it makes the biotech using their license IPO less valuable. This is what has the financial world up in arms. In theory the biotech is worth a bunch of inestment potential; but if the patent they've licensed is reduced and the have go get a new license from cal, that money will come out of the investors profits </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Vietnam a company of marines surrounded by VC called for an airstrike much closer to their position than USAF policy allowed. The Marines were about to be overrun and said they didn't care whether they took casualties as they expected to be tortured or killed anyway. The pilot made the strike against policy. It was a cluster munition that basically  kills everything in a donut pattern -ie there is "hole" in the middle that doesn't get blanketed with the fragmentation munitions. The pilot intended to strike to one side, but accidentally dropped directly on the marines with the "hole" exactly centered on their position. They took 4 casualties killed from the strike, but it completely wiped out the attacking VC, with almost 100 KIA. The pilot returned to base and was being brought up on court marshal by the USAF brass when paperwork arrived from the Marines putting him up for metal for having saved a whole company (even though 4 were killed).   </TEXT>

You turn individual bits on and off by pushing those buttons (setting up the boot sector cylinder and sector address) before you start the computer running with the LSO/Start switch in the lower right. This was the system that your military used to run the sonars in the US fast attack and boomer nuclear missile submarines until probably 1990.

<TEXT> During my college years, the university made the transition from punch cards to electronic terminals for the student programming projects. Prior to switch over you would write your code on paper, then enter it in on punch cards that had to be submitted to run. Punch cards were an office supply you bought either in decks of 100 or a large box of 2000. The latter was larger cost, but much lower on a per card basis. A friend bought the large and had only used about 1/3 when the university switched over to terminals. At graduation he still had that box with a brick of ~1200 cards.  

Cleaning out the apartment post graduation, doing final partying, somebody had the bright idea to go onto the roof of the apartment building and throw the brick of punch cards off so we could watch the explosion of paper cards spread out in a huge twirling cloud. One guy stayed downstairs to video the cloud from below while the rest of us troop to the top. The brick of cards was carefully tossed in a horizontal orientation to best riffle between the cards.  However, instead of exploding into a huge twirling mass, it stayed cohesive, basically a cellulose brick. It plummeted straight down onto the hood of the car driven by one of the partiers where upon it sort of broke into several large chunks. The hood of the car was left with a perfectly rectangular dent right in the middle. Talk about your buzzkill.

<TEXT> When I google "Axion Analytical Labs", a lot of the hits I get are for law enforcement officers performing forensic crime scene analysis who are citing their training at Axion Analytical Labs as part of their CV. In recent years a lot of evidence that has become standard LEO testimony has been shown to be compromised or lacking scientific credibility (e.g. blood spatter pattern analysis, hair fiber pattern matching). While these aren't directly relevant to gas chromatography, can you provide some detail on how the processes you have developed and trained LEOs to use are relevant to criminal forensic investigations? Where these techniques are used as evidence in a court of law, how has the scientific credibility of the test results been demonstrated to support the conclusions they're used for in court? 

---EDIT ----  

I've been amused to watch the karma points on this question tick up and down over the past week. I can understand people who up vote a question hoping to see it answered; but who down votes a question, especially after it has been answered? All I can think of is there are some LEOs or police groupies out there who object to the idea that a scientific test used in forensic investigations actually has to have some scientific basis for asserting facts in the court room. Although my question could have been better stated, it was interesting too that Dr Polite's response was basically an evasive non-answer.  

What prompted my question in the first place was this [article](http://www.chromatographytoday.com/news/gc-mdgc/32/breaking_news/how_is_gas_chromatography_used_in_forensics/30185/#sthash.N37CIAqH.dpuf ) online about gas chromatography used in crime scene investigations. It makes this utterly unscientific assertion: *since it can accurately identify substances with no error margin.* No one with a testing background would ever make the assertion that a test has no error margin. Every testing methodology has an error margin which one seeks to minimize. The failure to acknowledge and discuss the pros and cons of gas chromatography in crime scene investigations very much strikes me as indicative this testing methodology has some skeletons hiding in its closet.

Not my field but my first thought on reading this article was to research what exactly was meant by economic backwardness. There's a [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backwardness) on the topic, including discussion of early 20th century development of the British vs German economies, and the advantages accrued by the Germans with their more "backward" economy. It is not clear from the article whether the authors were looking at the technical definition of "economic backwardness" or whether they had their own more modern english semantics in mind when they wrote the article.

<TEXT> Not from perspective of janitor but of the perp. My dad suffered from a bad case of hemoroids and diverticulitis, also flatuence. When he would shit at work he would leave the toilet bowl splattered with shit and blood. In the early days of low flow toilets installed in government buildings, even multiple flushes wouldn't clear the sides. Janitorial bathroom service was only twice a week, but after dad left the restroom, someone would call janitorial service complaining that the toilets weren't being cleaned. On one of these occasions, janitor cleaned up the one restroom, then went to check the other restroom. Meanwhile dad had to shit and left a particularly bloody bowl. Janitor came back a few minutes after he finished to put out new toilet paper, found the toilet he'd just cleaned coated with bloody spatter. He went apeshit running through the halls screaming and cursing everyone saying they were going to cut off service of the company didn't get rid of the damned ass bleeder who kept fouling the bathroom. Janitorial staff threatened to go on strike. The final resolution of the issue was the government agreed to reinstall a full flow air pressure flush assist toilet to help keep the bowls cleaned  

--EDIT--  

After posting this, some of the details of this 20+ year old story came back to me. In his screaming tantrum running around the building the janitor accused them of doing various bizarre activities. Since this was a military weapons development lab office building, some of these were dark conspiracy theory accusations like using the toilets to flush away cut up fatal human test subjects.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the movie Gattaca, it was not the gene editing that caused the issues. It was instead the societal norms and laws that made individuals second class citizens who were denied opportunities because "of course" they couldn't perform as competently as the people with perfected designer genes. Somehow people seem to make this the fault of the gene editing rather than the societal bias based on the genetic editing. Mixed into all of this is the pseudo science fears injected by religious authorities against people "playing god". When you put it in those terms it is really cynical and cruel. If you could edit the genes of an embryo to prevent it from developing down's syndrome, is that "Playing God?" What does that say too say about the values we imbue to our god? That having been dealt genetic faults leading to development disorders, it is our duty to suffer them rather than thwart God's will?   </TEXT>

These statements begged the question, seeming to simply assume designer babies would be an evil act regardless of the context or the specific genetic edit applied. If designer babies are inherently unethical, a scientific conference discussing the ethics of using CRISPR for human genetic modification would seem obligated to make the case for this assertion, point by point.  Each point should be backed up with the legal/moral rationale behind the argument. Since it wasn't done in your podcast,  can you review the specific moral or ethical objections to designer babies? </TEXT>

<TEXT> While the reservoirs are filling to near normal levels, this "Mother of All El-Ninos" has only left the snow pack at near average levels. The reservoirs are a blip of capacity compared to the amount of water normally stored into the snow pack. Normally, the melt then refills the reservoir levels as they are used for irrigation during the year. If you [compare the snow pack this year with the big El Nino of 1982-1983](http://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi-progs/snow/PLOT_SWC), you can see it is only just barely reaching the average level of the previous several decades. When you consider the higher temperatures that come with global warming/climate change, that average snow pack is going to melt into those reservoirs, probably faster than they would normally be used. The result will be melted snow and empty reservoirs before the snow comes again in the fall, if it comes again in the fall.  </TEXT>

Since whale sharks are plankton/basking feeders, this suggests the range of the species on which these sharks feed is also shifting north. Is there also a corresponding reduction in the southern range of whale sharks? --ie are increasing ocean temperatures also killing the whale share prey species or making the waters too warm for the sharks to survive at the southern end of their range? </TEXT>

An example is high school chemistry experiments where you create tiny hydrogen bubbles by reacting zinc particles with hydrochloric acid. The presence of hydrogen is confirmed by holding a burning splint over the beaker. The sounds caused by the tiny bubbles of hydrogen exploding when they hit the flame are amazingly loud for the fact that they're the size of pinheads.

<TEXT> The current estimates for the age of the universe are between some numbers in 4th significant digit after 13.7 Billion years ago. Calculations derived from the Spitzer Space Telescope observations recently pinned down the rate of the universe expansion at 74.3 +/- 2.1 km/sec per megaparsec. If you project this linearly (which probably isn't completely valid), then anything further than 13.4 billion light years away is increasing in distance from the expansion of space faster than the speed of light. However, such movement is not said to be "traveling" -ie it is not moving at that speed. Space is simply getting bigger at that rate. Not really sure how general relatively handles that case. It might also be noted, the furthest observed galaxies are at about 13.2 billion light years away. However, they were nowhere near that far away when the light we're seeing from them now was emitted. According to theory, they will at some point in the future "wink out" when the expansion of the universe takes them out of our light cone.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Shortly after the explosion, while there was still uncertainty as to whether it was simple atomic or thermonuclear, a weapons expert opined even a 1% boost of the base fission device with thermonuclear elements would be considered a hydrogen bomb -ie thermonuclear is not determined by the size or even the amount of the boost. The fact that the explosion was smaller than their previous fission only explosion suggests they've either been able to miniaturize their original fission design (but reducing the yield), or their thermonuclear design ended up disrupting the yield more that it boosted it. I've seen references to poor thermonuclear weapon designs being subject to "tritium poisoning", where impure tritium/deuterium gas intended to boost the explosion actually ends up making it fizzle.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The title of the news article linked "Why Pollinators Forage on Toxic or Bitter Nectar" seems to suggest the nectar of plants containing bitter compounds is itself bitter. Since, by its nature, nectar contains sugar. It will most likely ll have at least some level of sweetness combined with the bitter. While it may not apply to insect tastes, I can't help but be reminded that things humans consider "interesting tastes" are generally a blend of two or more of the primary taste senses --e.g, BBQ sauces tend to be sweet, salty and sour at the same time. Ditto for thai food sauces - Sweet and Salty. Bitters in sweet cocktails are another example more relevant. Rather than bitter compounds having secondary microbial effects that then attract pollinators, I wonder if bitter compounds might simply be a case of creating a  bitter   sweet combination that pollinators find more attractive. At least one of the cited nectars, citrus, contains high levels of caffine, which is considered a bitter compound. Supposedly bees are attracted to it for "the buzz" they get.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So this isn't really about soap, but might be relevant. In homebrewing, many beginners start with kit brews, normally consisting of a can of malt syrup, yeast and possibly hops pellets.  They're often disappointed by the lack of head in these beers. The secret to headier beers is the use of grains from which the proteins in the kernel get leached into the solution for fermentation. Perhaps proteins are just a specific example of surfectant, but as a class, proteins are generally "sticky", they will hydrogen bond with each other at multiple distinct points and have long chain like structures that allow those sticky bonds to be stretched. I would suspect your tougher soap bubble soaps might have some protein or protein like substances linked onto the hydroloyzed hydrocarbon chains/alcohols that make up the major component of soaps.

<TEXT> Anti-muslim racists/bigots will sometimes cite the legal process in Muslim countries as "Rule of Judge" as opposed to western countries as "Rule of Law". Basically in non-rule-of-law countries, the judges can just make it up as they go along. They can decide one person is guilty and punished for the same crime and evidence that another person is let off, without justification or even having to provide a rationale. I see stories like this and question how we can claim "run of law" in our country when something like this can go on for years. Even now, the only repercussion for the judge is that he agrees not to do it any more. Why wasn't he charged with criminally abusing the power of his office? How is a simple agreement not to do it in the future providing justice for his clearly  illegal rulings? Specifically, why isn't this judge removed from office and thrown in jail? </TEXT>

Different types of cherries will often take grafting to each other, but don't like to go onto the larger fruits.

<TEXT> The confusing thing I see is the explosion seems to come from the top of the pouring column of molten salt as the salt stream tapers off rather than from the leading head that had been in the water the longest. Why would that be? Did some water get encapsulated by molten salt, boil and then blow the salt column apart?  

BTW - this takes me back to my middle school days when I used to melt salt in ceramic flower pots on my dad's gas grill. I'd use Dad's battery charger to electrolyze the salt, boiling off the chlorine to get a small lump of sodium for throwing into water </TEXT>

<TEXT> So to the point on OP's question, even successful construction and operation of ITER will not get us to the point of generating fusion power. ITER, if it is successful will teach us how to start and sustain a fusion reaction. From this, it should be possible to design a fusion reactor from which we can extract heat and generate power. A comparison could be made to the timeline from the first controlled fission reaction to the first military and commercial fission reactions. It is not completely fair  both because there was a war going on and the technology was quite a bit less advanced; but the timeline from the construction and operation of Fermi's Pile-1 at the University of Chicago 1942 to the opening of the Shippingport Nuclear Reactor (1957) and launch of the USS Nautilus nuclear powered submarine(1955) was about 12 to 15 years. So, assuming ITER lights up and runs this year, could we expect a commercial fusion reactor before 2026?  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  ITER, which will be, with some distance, the largest tokamak reactor and will be the first fusion reactor to generate more power than it uses. 

Some definition of terms would be useful here. Will ITER actually "generate" power? It's my understanding it won't. It is still at the stage of trying to sustain a fusion reaction from which more energy could be extracted than it took setup and sustain it. It doesn't mean that energy will actually be extracted and used to generate power.  It should be noted, the US's National Ignition Facility has already achieved the breakeven threshold of more energy produced than required to setup. However, it was never designed to be a power generation facility either.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Another method might be to mess with the internal structure of the sun to turn off its nuclear fission.   

Fusion - the sun is doing fusion, not fission. 
In his book "Iron Sunrise", Charles Stross imagined how this might be done, although the physics was sort of magical: all the remaining fuel for fusion in the core of the star was transmuted into iron, causing an immediate stop of fusion. Outward radiation pressure from the fusion processes is balanced by the crushing inward gravitational pressure from the mass of the sun. Stop the fusion and the star collapses, much like a fission implosion bomb. When all the mass comes crushing it, maybe you get a neutron star, maybe you get a black hole, maybe you just get a ball of really hot iron; but there is a shitload of energy released just by the conversion of all that potential energy as the giga-giga tonnes of matter fall from the outer layers of the sun toward the center. All that energy is going to blow all the outer layers off in a huge explosion, like a supernova

<TEXT> Back in the 1980s the USA had this thing called Milk Price Support (hell they may still have it today). Anyway, if the dairy farmers couldn't sell their milk at the federally set price minimum, the government had to buy it from them at that price. This had been going on since probably the 1930s. The upshot was that over time all that government milk was being converted into velveeta cheese food. Now the government was stockpiling cheese food. Additional government spending was occurring just to store the fucking velveeta. Reagan decided instead of giving people money   food stamps which they tended to use to buy wonder bread and velveeta, they'd just give them velveeta directly. This would empty the government warehouses, allowing the leases to be cancelled, thereby saving the government money. About 1984 there commenced the great government cheese food gifting. Anybody could show up and get 20 pounds of velveeta style cheese food. The next day you could get 20 pounds more, etc. Recipes were invented e.g. Spam logs with cheese food and instant Mac noodles. It was a simpler, cheesier time. Soon demand for liquid cheese food pumped onto chips became a mainstay of the American diet. Dairy farmers could start selling the produce of their velveeta producing cows directly to movie theaters, bars and street vendors. The economy grew in leaps and bounds, and cheese food took over the world. Thank god for those pioneers who first braved the culinary challenge of wtf do i do with 20 fuck lbs of cheese food? Without theses early chefs, the USA would have collapsed under the weight of all those warehouses full of it </TEXT>

Instead the results only suggest that these insects migrate long distances and experiments to verify this assertion should be undertaken. Other possible explanations for the finding include the possibility that the insects are unusually homogeneous in the genome and perhaps suffered a recent genetic bottleneck.

<TEXT>  It's only bad if you don't know it's a satire  

I've mentioned this elsewhere but will restate it here. Starship Troopers as written by Heinlein represented a heartfelt ethic of 1950's / 1960's conservative America. In some ways it is not all that different from near worshipful status of anything associated with the military in today's GOP conservative culture. When Hollywood decided to make the movie they went over the top with their fascist iconography and comments like those of the recruiting sergeant with half his body blown away: "The Mobile Infantry made me the man I am today!", all said in the tone of true enthusiasm. It truly is satire, but at least a portion of today's population doesn't see anything wrong with the idea that only former members of the military should be qualified to vote or hold political office.

<TEXT> Definitely knew the snake guy. Bought a 10 foot boa or python. He was girlfriend's roomate's boyfriend. Muscle builder but wouldn't play Frisbee because he said it would tone his muscles and make them smaller. It was all about the look. Funny thing with the snake. He liked to play "who's fastest" with his snake. He'd get some raw chicken, warm it up to body temp then flap it around in front of the snake. The snake would coil up and go into a ready posture. He'd wave the meat around then pull it back when he saw the snake starting to strike. When the snake hit the meat instead of missing, he'd let it eat. Sort of had to because the snake had teeth pointing backward in its mouth, so you couldn't really drag anything back. Anyway, one time he pulled the meat back over his shoulder. The snake missed the meat, but hit his head. The teeth stuck into his scalp and he started bleeding like a stuck pig. He and the girlfriend were trying to work its jaws off, but he was very concerned that they not hurt his precious snake. The snake started unhinging its jaw and stretching its mouth. It was trying to eat his fucking owner! Each time the snake worked its jaw, its mouth slide a little further open and further down his head. He was bleeding pretty bad. When the jaw got over his eyebrow, they decided to go to the emergency room. He was still intent that his snake not be hurt but when he walked in the ER with a 10 foot snake hanging off his head and blood running down his face and shirt, they immediately took out a scalpel and cut the snake's head off. The guy was super pissed and was trying to sue them for the price of a new snake.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is there any astronomical or astrophysics basis to this statement in the article:

The culprit appears to be the supermassive black holes found in the centres of galaxies. Some of the matter falling towards the holes is converted into energy. 

A literal reading of this sentence suggests there is direct matter to energy conversion at the event horizon/firewall of a black hole. Matter to energy conversion does happen in the fusion cores of stars and in radioactive nuclei decay, but I've never hear it described as occurring on the surface of an event horizon. Can anyone elaborate?

<TEXT> It's a decent SF book. It won the Nebula Award in 1976. Written 40 years ago, so you have to expect some retro and anachronistic elements. The gay thing is a minor plot element. It is mainly an allegory for the Viet Nam War, which was very recent experience and very much on all of our minds. After quite a long interval, he eventually wrote a sequel called "The Forever Peace" which I don't recall enjoying quite as much. Certainly I couldn't summarize the plot basics from memory as I can for the original.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a beekeeper I'll tell you, 1000 bees is a hive that is badly dwindled and in danger of dying out. Typical commercial 3 lb "packages" of bees consist of about 10,000 bees and a queen. A "Nucleus" hive is typically 5 frames covered with bees and would typically have closer to 5000 bees, but would also include brood that would have new bees starting to hatch out immediately, to start swelling the population. Nuc hives are created by taking two frames of bees, with brood. This is still about 2000 bees, plus brood ready to start hatching. 

Since this paper is an "in silico" theoretical model, it has its own logic, but thought it was interesting that actual practice starts new hives with 2000 or twice the theoretical minimum critical population.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Joe Halderman's book, "The Forever War", the main character is a grunt soldier in an interstellar war where he effectively hops forward in time as he spends years in time dilation on the way to and from battles at near light speed. Written in 1974 by a Vietnam combat vet, the main character becomes the "old man" who survives through multiple battles and the ranks fill with newbies born centuries after he first enlisted in the war effort. In the projected future the government began encouraging homosexuality as a means to stop the population boom. After time, homosexuality becomes the norm, and heterosexuality the weird perversion. The other soldiers call him "queer" behind his back.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I don't have the background to evaluate the complete implications of this research to the narrow field it is filed in, on the surface it appears to be a quite obvious conclusion wrapped in pretentious and overly jargoned terminology. I'll also take issue with the title of the post as compared to the content of the original research. From the original paper summary  

A trade-off between survival and reproduction is evident throughout the geographical ranges of our study species: resprouting species with fire-protected buds had much higher fire survival than nonsprouters without fire-protected buds (97% vs. 2%) but they also had substantially lower fecundity and recruitment rates. We found little intraspecific variation in fire survival rates but considerable intraspecific variation in fecundity and recruitment  

Basically it says there wasn't much variation in fire survival between different species, but there was a big variation between species in their subsequent bloom fertilization (ie "recruitment") and seed production ("fecundity").   

On a broader scale, the research finds the species distribution of shrubs in an area damaged by fire changes in the years after the fire, with some species assuming a greater percentage of the total population/biomass whereas other species declining in population percentage.   

Clearly a fire will affect the local microclimates, especially since microclimates are themselves partially the result of the forest population. There are species that only flourish in direct sunlight whereas others are intolerant of direct sun. Dense foliage tends to create pockets of shade where moisture and humus accumulates, providing a nursery environment where some species would otherwise be unable to survive. These have been tenants of forest evolution over time.   

This is not my field, but I'm having a hard time understanding why this would be considered a significant paper worth publishing. While this paper provides a quantitative confirmation of long known principles, through the use of dense technical jargon it appears the authors are trying to make the case that it is making a profound statement about expected affects of climate change. Is there someone who can disabuse me of this impression? Is there something here of more significance? </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the Philippines there is a dark skinned pygmie type tribe in the mountains called the Negritoes. The USAF used to work with them doing survival training for pilots before they started their tours in Vietnam. Basically they'd drop the pilots in the jungle and they had to do escape and evasion as long as they could until the tribesmen caught them. My dad had pictures of the guys that captured and fed him until the trainers showed up to get him. They looked different from Filipinos - very short, afroid type features, kinky afro style hair. Interestingly, they also smoked cigarettes with the lit end in their mouths. Pictures I've seen of the Papau New Guinea highlanders looked very similar, although not so small.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [This is my graphical interpretation](http://imgur.com/Et9cMEz) of the interbreeding timeline described in the prose in the article. Some questions as to whether all these are accurate but at least a little more detail than their graphic  

What I think they're saying is that there are 4 branches of modern humans (in the drawing at least). 
Not sure what the two in Africa are.
I think the two non-african variants are  
V.c: European/Asians/Amerindians with 1-3% Neanderthal and traces of Densinovian.   
V.d Australian/Papau New Guinea natives with 3-7% Denisovian DNA.   

It is unclear whether they're saying the archaic modern human/neanderthal cross completely died out, or is included in the Neanderthal genome V.c (europeans, asians, etc) carry in their DNA  

It also seems like they're saying the Australians/PNG natives don't include the Neanderthal genes, just the Denisovians, questioning whether that is a separate branch.

<TEXT> This is a very interesting and thought provoking article. I am troubled by some of the terminology and the graphics not fully reflecting the complexity described in the prose. Apparently the cave in Denisova was home not only to the hominid line "Denisovians" but also Altai-Neaderthal who were themselves genetically distinct from your European based Neaderthals. The genetics of the Altai-Neanderthal also apparently incorporated some DNA of a Homo Erectus  from a cross breeding as recent as 400K years ago. [The graphic](http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline_colwidth__16_9/public/images/lb_R_NeandertalEMBED.jpg?itok=V8aR4diR) shows multiple branchings of the modern humans, including two present today in Africa and two more outside of Africa, but only a single breed line for all the described lines Neaderthals, never mind the described Homo Erectus.  It would be really nice to see the full complexity described in the article accurately portrayed in a graphic.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Current marine dead zones are largely attributed to high nutrient loads causing runaway proliferation of organisms the subsequently deplete the oxygen in the water column. Examples are areas such as the Chesapeake Bay deadzones in the run from farming areas where chicken manure is applied to farm fields. Also at the outflow of the Mississippi river into the Gulf of Mexico, carrying nutrient loads from the entire US Midwest. Similar dead zones also occur in the Baltic, Mediterranean and South China Sea.  While these are related to human activity, they seem more the result of human disruption of natural Nitrogen and Phosphorus cycles rather than the Carbon cycle changes normally associated with anthropogenic Global Warming/Climate change. How relevant are oceanic oxygen level changes from past, natural climate change episodes to the current oxygen depletion scenarios? Are you postulating increased oceanic nutrient loads in past, natural climate change or are you looking at completely different mechanisms? How does the magnitude of past oxygen depletion compare to current day dead zones?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Spitzer telescope recently determined the rate of expansion of the universe is 74.2 km/sec +/- 2.1 km/sec per megaparsec. (per 3.26 million light years). Dividing the speed of light c by the expansion rate gives 13.1 Billion light years as the distance beyond which the universe is expanding faster than speed of light. Of course this is just linear calculation. There's some nonlinearity with an asymptotic approach to the speed of light that probably makes the distance a little bit further. But consider, the age of the universe is ~13.7 billion years; but the universe was opaque to light for the first 380,000 years. So, the light speed receding edge of the visible universe is approximately same distance away in light years as the point in time when the first photons in the universe started propagating. The farthest away spotted galaxy,EGS-zs8-1, is 13.1 billion light years away --ie it is right on the edge of that light speed receding edge.  </TEXT>

Also, same question in reference to Susskind, et al with regards to suitably entangled particles seeming to be connected by wormhole like structures. Is this a purely theoretical example? Or, alternatively, is there an actual observed phenomenon where a connection through extradimensional wormholes connections is one explanation? If the latter, can you provide more detail on that observation?

<TEXT> Oman, UAE, Kuwait all have between 300 and 600 tanks in their army inventory. If you assume all those countries armies have 100% of their tanks in exercise readiness AND are willing to send them into the exercise, leaving the home country undefended, you still only get to total of 2,500 medium and heavy tanks. Maybe twice that if you include APCs and the like. You can say yeah, but Egypt, Sudan   Turkey too. Those countries can't drive their tanks to Saudi - they'd have to ship them. You'd see stuff like the months run up to Gulf War I   II: cargo ship after cargo ship with tanks rolling off. That hasn't been happening, and oh by the way, none of these fucking countries have 100% of their tank inventories operational. A lot of them probably have readiness rates below 50%. 

I'd have to say that was probably the "Mother of All Press Releases".

<TEXT> Descriptions of string theory indicate various versions of theory require 6, 7, 10 or 11 dimensions whereas we only perceive 3, or 4 dimensions if you count time as one. The fact that we can't see or sense these dimensions is explained by suggestions that they are "compact" or curled up in tiny closed loops. Do any of the string theories describe forces or particles that transmit or translate through these hidden dimensions to create effects we can see and measure in the 3/4 visible dimensions? For example, particle quantum entanglement is bit of mystery in our current physics, especially the apparent "instaneous" communication of the quantum state information between entangled particles when one particle is measured. Do any of the string theories suggest the channel of communication between distantly separated entangled particles could be communicated through these hidden dimensions? Are there any other examples of forces or fields in the standard model that string theory says is operating through these dimensions?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> People discussing fusion reactors usually focus on the use of abundant Deuterium extracted from water as the fuel. While Deuterium would be part of the fuel mix, most of the fusion reactor designs are built around the use of a combined deuterium-tritium fuel source. The ITER reactor for example [will use a 1:1 mix of D-T fuel](https://www.iter.org/sci/fusionfuels). The D-T fusion reaction produces an excess neutron. These neutrons have applications  such as producing more tritium for the reactor's fuel, but they will also induce radioactivity in the materials that make up the structure and lining of the reaction chamber. The end result will be the production of nuclear waste - radioactive metals and the like. It will be no where near the volume of radioactive waste produced by fission reactors; but it will be produced none the less. Some designs have also called for the fusion reactor to be used to breed plutonium from the neutrons and U238 lining the reaction chamber. The plutonium would be used to fuel fission based reactors but has the added issue of being a nuclear weapons material - something that could be considered a hazard of the fusion reactor.  </TEXT>

I don't mean to demean this accomplishment, but the "temperature" of the solar wind near earth is something like 150K kelvin, but is so diffuse there is effectively no heat transfer.

The argument /u/Jkeets777 is making is that it is justified to knock down the house of the perpetrator's family because the PA supports the family financially. This is really a red herring. It's not really clear the assertion that the PA does this is anything more than hearsay, but assuming it is valid. One can very well draw parallels with the economic and legal support the Israeli government has provided to settlers. Really the focus should be on the validity of home destruction for associates of the perpetrators.

<TEXT> While PA's wink, wink, nod, nod attitude toward Palestinians perpetuating violence is disgusting,  the issue here is consistent application of legal remedies the Israeli authorities use against Palestinian vs Jewish terrorists. It can very well be argued that the Israeli government support for Jewish settlers who seize arab owned lands to build settlements is the equivalent of the PA support for the families of terrorists. If tearing down the home of an extended family of palestinians because one member of the family engaged in an attack on Israelis is justified, why should it not apply to Jewish settlers who do the same? </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of discussion of the Fermi Paradox and Drake Equation look at probability both across space and time. For space they look at the sheer number of stars, assume some proportion have planets, then some smaller proportion have Earth like planets, then some smaller proportion have life arise, then complex multi-cellular life, then intelligent life, then technologically capable life. The argument of time is one that says this whole sequence could have occurred anytime since the universe first began until the present time; and that technological civilizations exist for a finite time, either because they destroy themselves or transform into something we no longer recognize as intelligent/technological life. This article modifies the above thought process slightly by saying, wait a minute - there weren't enough heavy elements available in the first and possibly second generation of stars for Earth like planets capable of sustaining life to form. The clock for these equations has to be started much later. The problem with this descriptive article is that it doesn't document any of the updated assumptions that they're using to make their assessment. The sun is a third generation star so at least part of the assessment is apparently that only 3rd generation stars are likely to host the proper planets (and when did the first 3rd generation stars come into existence). This article would have a lot more credibility if all the assumptions about what is required for life on an earth-like planet to exist were documented or at least mentioned.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Syria and Russia have [Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia%E2%80%93Syria_relations), which is something less formal than an Alliance. The NATO alliance includes specific obligations for military resources and shared defense in the face of an attack. Given that there are already Russian military deployed and engaged in combat in Syria, the difference is somewhat moot, but the relationship with Syria is not comparable to say, the Warsaw Pact alliance treaty.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> While your transparency report is a good first step, there is a category of moderator actions that isn't addressed in your report at all, one which has a strong odor of moderator personal bias.   

The sub rules indicate submissions must be from peer reviewed journals, yet a large portion, ney a majority of top posts are from popular science news sites writing about new peer reviewed research. Given this characteristic of the sub as a whole, removed posts for "not a peer reviewed journal" appear to be motivated by something other than sub rules. The number of removed original posts, as opposed to removed comments, along with the reason for removal, does not appear to be a category in your transparency report. 

Similarly, original posts with fairly extensive comment threads have been removed with reason cited "Post is duplicate of same news from another source" and "Posting is lower rated (even though it may have been posted earlier) than duplicate". Again, this is a sub rule that appears to be honored more in the breach than in actual practice. At any point in time, it is not uncommon to find the same new scientific announcement/news listed in the sub from at least 3 or 4 different sources.  Sometimes this is tedious, but other times helpful. Some sources have better analysis or illustrative graphics for the discovery. Yet, somehow, sometimes a moderator will decide one of these shouldn't be in the sub and will remove it. Your transparency report should document when these so called "duplicates" are removed, along with statistics on cases where duplicates are allowed to remain.

What kind of crap is this? A person who is basically a criminal assault perp get to testify that his actions are consistent with state police policy and training? How does he get to be the witness who asserts this. Although I've no doubt the State Police would have no problem finding some other lying asshole who was willing to assert the same, shouldn't such a statement be coming from someone within the police management hierarchy responsible for policy? Shouldn't someone from police training be testifying that yes indeed they train police officers to kick motorists who are complying with a traffic stop in the chest with their boots? </TEXT>

All the remaining columns list the actual value of the parameter for the state: Share with Bachelor's Degrees, Median Age, Household Income   Share who call religion "very important". If you're going to show one column as difference from the USA median, why not list all columns with the state's variation from the USA median value? It certainly would provide a better visualization of each state's distance from the middle along the defined values.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A bit pedantic, but the phrasing of the question "fastest accelerating things" is ambiguous. It can be interpreted as either things that were accelerated to high speed or things that are accelerated at the highest (fastest) rate. The point being objects can achieve very high speeds as the result of long duration low acceleration. Conversely an object subjected to very high acceleration, or deceleration, doesn't have to achieve a very high end velocity if it is subjected to a very short duration but high intensity acceleration. By the latter definition things like high velocity projectiles impacting into solid surfaces can be described as having very high decelerations  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Russia recently announced a new concern about the growing problem of space junk cluttering Earth's orbital space: they declared a [space junk collision with a military satellite could spark a war](http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-says-space-junk-could-spark-war-2016-1). While the causes of sudden satellite failures are mysteries that have to be solved, space junk collisions are clearly a possibility that has to be considered. Why would Russia go out of their way to say such an event could provoke a war? Are they declaring their own country's inability to accept such destruction of one their own satellites as blameless?  (Many Russians are still convinced the USA sank their submarine Kursk). Are they preparing the waters for Russia to attack American satellites and be able to deny responsibility? What agenda or possible agendas does such a declaration have?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When young people in western countries with an Islamic family background attempt terrorism or head to the middle east to participate in violent jihad, law enforcement and the press asked the question "How did these youths become radicalized?". Often it is found there was indeed an instigator either in the community or on the internet who recruited and cultivated them into their violent acts. In some cases these instigators have been arrested or killed in drone strikes. Dylann Roof's family has disavowed his apparently racially motivated violent act. Who then radicalized Roof? Should the FBI call in a drone strike to take out the manipulator(s) who egged him on? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> At a recent family gathering, a somewhat distant cousin showed up in his new sheriff's uniform. He's only recently hired in his first law enforcement job and is currently doing highway/traffic patrols. We live in the south and based on past conversations, I know he is highly prejudiced toward blacks.  In conversation he mentioned in his new job, he's yet to work a shift where he hasn't drawn his gun at least one time. While genuine fear for their lives is usually cited as the rationale in police shootings, drawing one's weapon as a precaution on a daily basis seems excessive. It also seems as if it could be viewed as threatening behavior that could trigger a violent response where one would not otherwise occur. Do police officers generally have to report they've drawn their weapons and/or provide a rationale for having done so in their reporting? Should such frequent drawing of one's weapon be considered a sign of excessive fearfulness that suggests someone is not right for the job? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recently took a guided trip out on to a glacier in Iceland. The guide indicated the ice had to be at least 50m thick in order for it to be classified as a glacier. That thickness is required before the ice at the bottom becomes plastic enough to begin flowing, part of the definition of a glacier.  Got me to wondering whether the plasticity is the result of a phase change in the ice.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Having a discussion with a friend, he asserted a mild pepper plant grown in close proximity to a hot pepper would have greater "heat" from the pollen of the nearby hot plants. My inclination would be to think any traits passed on by the pollinating plant wouldn't show up until seeds of the cross were grown into a new plant that flowered and grew fruit --ie the seeds are the zygotes of the two parents, but the fruit itself only has the characteristic of the female parent plant (yeah I know both plants both male and female, I'm using "female" in the sense  of the plant growing the fruit). Which is the correct view? Are the genes of the pollinating plant expressed in the fruit? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-03-20 21:30:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Since the debris spotted in the Southern Ocean seem to be latest, best clue indicating the plane flew down the southern corridor, there's still some legwork that can be done to help find the plane. For debris to be down there, the plane must have followed a track down there. Jet aircraft contrails are often visible in satellite images. For example, here's an [image from the EOS satellite MODIOS] (https://earthdata.nasa.gov/labs/worldview/?switch=geographic products=baselayers,MODIS_Terra_SurfaceReflectance_Bands143,MODIS_Terra_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor~overlays,sedac_bound time=2014-03-08 map=-77.479858,36.171753,-74.234497,38.467896) instrument of the US Mid-Atlantic Coast on March 8. The linear streaks of multiple airline contrails are visible, especially at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. The area where the debris were spotted is very lightly traveled by commercial aircraft. In warmer temperatures of tropical regions, jets often don't leave trails, but further south it is cold enough MH370 might have left one. Sometimes jet trails are also visible as clear tracks in existing cloud cover. Contrails above a cloud layer will also sometimes be visible as shadows on the lower cloud layer. Here's a [possible contrail ](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/labs/worldview/?switch=geographic products=baselayers,MODIS_Terra_CorrectedReflectance_Bands367~overlays,sedac_bound time=2014-03-08 map=81.310905,-53.341592,84.556267,-51.04545) in an area west of where the debris were spotted. The colors are from a different spectral band being viewed. I'd appreciate comments from weather knowledgeable redditors whether this is likely an artificial or natural cloud formation.  Others should look for and tag possible contrails in the MODIS data for March 8 as well as any other country's geosynch and polar orbiting weather satellite image data that can be accessed by the public </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> With the announcement of a bunch of new planets discovered in the kepler data, multiple articles have included a statement indicating the biggest problem they have is distinguishing planet transits from an eclipsing binary star. In looking around for some information on Betelgeuse recently found a paper describing how scientists have imaged really big "sun spots" on Betelgeuse. Since stars rotate, such spots would traverse across the surface of the planet. Spots on the sun also appear, disappear, and reappear over multiple rotations. Timing of such appearances  could approximate the periodicity of a planetary transits. How is this possibility eliminated from Kepler analyses?

<DATE> 2014-01-20 20:23:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In [various descriptions](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/unify.html) of the chronology of the early universe, gravity is shown as the first force to separate from the unified forces. It is followed by the separation of the strong, then weak nuclear forces, leaving the four fundamental forces gravity, strong, weak, and electromagnetism.  However, if you look at the relative strength of the forces, they are in order strong, weak, electromagnetism, and gravity. In inverse order of the distance over which the forces operate they are again, strong, weak, electromagnetism, and gravity. Further, on a separate line of reasoning, when discussing the Planck length, one of the rationales for why it cannot be measured is that any apparatus big enough to measure it would be so massive it would collapse into a blackhole. Collapsing into a blackhole seems to be intimately tied to the force of gravity and the mass density of an object. Yet the early universe is postulated to have extremely high density. At the end of the inflationary era, all the mass of the universe was in a volume the size of a grapefruit. If gravity had indeed separated from the other forces, why would the early universe not have immediately collapsed into a blackhole? Is the assumption that gravity separated from the other forces first just a convenient assumption because we have no functioning/consistent theory of quantum gravity like we have for the other forces?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the past few weeks I've received calls at my home from a robocaller purporting to be the security department from credit cards held both by my wife, and separate card held by me. The call opens with a statement that there has been suspicious activity on the credit card that needs to be verified. It then asked if the person speaking is my name or my wifes name. Voice recognition listens for "yes" or "no", then asks for verification of identity with personal information. Call for my wife asked for last 4 of SSN (did not provide). This turned out to be for a Target stores card. They did not admit to having made the call, but informed her of the Target breach. Call for me asked for birth date, then when this was provided, asked for zipcode. At this point I hung up. Called security number on the back of card (Chase Bank Visa) and ascertained they had not called. This appears to be targeted spearphishing seeking to get personal identity verification information for card number/name/phone number they already have obtained through some previous data breach or hack.  Has anyone else experienced these calls? Anyone heard of this as an ongoing scam.  </TEXT>

Meanwhile we've had several fairly significant rocks pass between earth and the moon (there was a big one passing the same day the Chelyabinsk meteor hit Russia). Afterwards, I haven't seen much analysis showing how much these asteroid's orbits have been deflected and how different they are afterwards. The JPL small body orbit browser is pretty clear that it shows only the two-body solution of the asteroid orbits with the sun. It seems unlikely an asteroid passing 4M miles away is going to end up at a significantly different place than it would have already been passing. Hence the question - how close does one really need to pass to the Earth before we really don't know where it is going to be in 10 or 20 years? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Saw a news photo the other day of a republican rally with a banner bearing the letters "GOP.GOV". I had been under the impression the .gov domain was limited to official governmental bodies. Thought it was fake, but sure enough gop.gov is the republican party official website. In contrast, the democrats website is www.democrats.org --i.e. consistent with what you'd expect for an organization.  Who decides what organizations can have a .gov domain, and who specifically let the republicans have one? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have been using my iphone 5 as my strava GPS for about a year now and really enjoy getting the statistics. Would like to add heart rate monitor for further data. However, a friend warned me the bluetooth signal for the heart rate monitor probably wouldnt connect when it has to pass through my body. Although Wahoo monitor with iphone is listed as supported with Strava, it likely depends on the connection geometry. While runners would typically keep their iphone in a holder on their upper arm, most bikers keep their phone in their jersey back pocket. Thus for biking, the signal has to pass through a big meaty water filled bag (your torso). Does anyone have experience with bluetooth connect heart rate monitors with iphone while cycling? Any issues? All is well? Any experiences positive or negative would be appreciated </TEXT>

For the most part it appears to boundary was set such that Illinois ended at the river's edge, but it deviates to the middle in some places. In a few places it twists into [curled over sections](http://goo.gl/maps/5YTO0) that don't look like they could have ever conformed to a shoreline.

So, taking the cynical view, which of McCain's paymasters are telling him to advocate for the attack?  Who would be the beneficiaries of a US attack on Syria? Is this mainly about the military spending that would be needed to sustain and replace the armaments used or are there other industries that would benefit too?   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In the 1980s when the US was in trade conflict with Japan over imports and US debt, it became popular to describe the limited power of the Japanese premier. The thrust of the articles was Japanese policies were actually controlled by a cabal of bureaucrats in Japanese ministries who were not accountable to the electorate. Over the course of the Obama administration, US government decisions and policies which conflict sharply with Obama's positions have come to light. Among these, the FDA decision to restrict sales of Plan B contraceptives, the failure to close Guantanamo, and the widespread electronic surveillance of the US population.  All these give rise to the question - are the actions of the US executive branch really under the control and management of the presidency? Do the bureaucrats, and the hidden hands of corporate, congressional, or other parties actually control actions and policies of the US government? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Reading recently about interstellar dust grains identified in some meteorites and from the Stardust mission samples, these grains were identified by the difference in isotopic ratios that the Sun inherited from the presolar nebula. Thinking about the pictures of multiple proto-stars forming in the Orion and Eagle nebula stellar nurseries, it seemed like these stars forming from the same nebular should share the same isotopic fingerprint. If this is the case, wouldn't there be stars out there that formed in the same nebula  as the Sun? Have we identified any starts that appear to have the same isotopic fingerprint as our own solar system, indicating they formed from the same nebular 4.x billion years ago? </TEXT>

<TITLE> What negative associations with the Christian Right in response to their opposition to gay marriage? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-04-01 13:52:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In what appears to be an organized campaign, Christian Right politicians are attempting to whip up popular opposition to same sex marriage by grouping it with beatiality and pedophilia as if such associations were a natural common classification of all three activities. Turning the tables, what are some similar, natural associations with the Christian Right that illustrate the same principle? Baptists drinking the blood of sacrificed babies comes to mind, but a bit awkward to use in a sentence.

EDIT
So this was mainly in response to Ben Carson's statement 
"Well, my thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman. It's a well-established, fundamental pillar of society and no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA [North American Man/Boy Love Association], be they people who believe in bestiality. It doesn't matter what they are. They don't get to change the definition

His words weren't said in isolation. The attempts to equate consensual gay love with bestiality and child sexual abuse have been going on for months. I'm looking for something like "Organizations with a history of child abuse, blackmail, and extortion, such as Catholic Dioceses, should not have a voice in determining the morality of laws up for consideration any more than Mafia would be allowed to affect financial disclosure laws" </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Two different companies have recently announced plans to begin mining asteroids for rare metals. Composition of meteorites from the big Russian meteor is being described as 10% iron mixed in with olivine and sulfites. Science fiction has painted a number of scenarios for smelting asteroids in space, mostly by using focused solar energy and exotic methods of steering molten metals with directed magnetic fields. Have the companies that are proposing to start mining asteroids in the next 20-30 years provided any details for how they plan to extract the mined materials in the weightless and vacuum environment of space? Is it possible without inventing new technologies or boosting incredibly large factories into orbit? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Could we lasso an asteroid during a near earth encounter? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Asteroid 2012 DA14, discovered only about a year ago, will make the closest approach of any asteroid of its size since we started seriously worrying about collisions. It is a shame we couldn't have a space probe prepared in that time to latch onto the rock when it passed so close by. Understanding at least part of the problem in doing so is the lack of time to get a spacecraft into position and accelerated to the velocity at which it will be passing the earth. Would it have been possible to attach a space craft to a  net hooked to a tether on the spacecraft to essentially lasso the passing rock and yank it along with the asteroid. Do we possess any materials strong enough to withstand such the  shock of such a capture? Assuming the spacecraft was traveling in an orbit aligned with the asteroid's trajectory, how many G's would the spacecraft experience in such a capture?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Nasa recently the Grail mission spacecraft, Ebb and Flow, into a mountain near the lunar north pole. The spacecraft were flying in a fairly low orbit (14 miles) and their fuel nearing exhaustion when Nasa decided to crash them. One of the reasons cited for doing so was the spacecraft orbits would eventually decay and Nasa did not want them to crash in a culturally significant area, like one of the previous moon landing sites. 

Why was orbit decay an issue? Isn't the Moon's atmosphere so close to total vacuum that orbital drag is non-existent? What kind of timeframe for natural orbital decay would we be talking about? Years, centuries, millennium?

<TITLE> Are significant numbers of military members illegal voters in the states where they live? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-09-30 17:36:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> With the recent controversies where republican controlled states have sought to purge the voter rolls of "illegal voters", most of whom happen to be in heavily democratic party voting populations, it got me wondering about military voters, of whom there are quite a few in swing states such as virginia and colorado. Military members can choose to be residents of any state in the country, called their "home of record" in their military records. Many military members take advantage of this to make their home of record one of the states that do not have a state income tax. Yet they live in and consume government services such as public schools, roads, etc. funded by state taxes in the state where they reside. Military members are also supposed to only register to vote in their "home of record" state, voting with absentee ballots. Military members also tend as a group to vote heavily republican. So in these republican controlled states where they have been seeking to purge the voter rolls of illegal voters, have they been cross checking voter rolls with military records or state income tax records to determine whether military members have registered to vote in the local state elections without changing their home of record? Does the military verify its members have not registered to vote in a state different from their home of record? Is this a potentially large population of illegal voters?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Looking up at the summer triangle last night I realized it contains both the star, Vega (or Altair, I've seen them both cited) to which the solar system is currently headed, and the Kepler probe field of view. Kepler detects planets that pass between their primary star and the Kepler probe/Earth/Solar System. Thus it can only see planets whose orbital plane is in line with the direction to the earth. Is it only a coincidence that we're looking at stars along the line in which our own star is traveling in its galactic orbit? Or, is there some reason to believe the orbital planes of the solar systems are lined up along their galactic orbit/velocity vectors? </TEXT>
