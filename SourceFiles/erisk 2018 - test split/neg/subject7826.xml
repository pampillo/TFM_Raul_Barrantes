<TEXT> Sure, the pork belly went into the ziploc bag with:

1/4 cup each of soy   mirin;
2 tbsp each fish sauce   sugar;
1 tbsp of ketjap manis;
chopped ginger and scallions.

Cook for 24 hours at 68 degrees C in the water bath.

Let bag cool, then pop it in the fridge to solidify fat. After cooling, remove belly from bag, chop into 1 inch wide slabs and sear them over high heat. Strain sauce from bag into saucepan, leaving the hardened fat behind, and add 1/4 cup broth, minced garlic and scallions, and healthy big spoonfuls of white miso and gochujang paste. Reduce, then pour over the belly. Really, really, good.

<TEXT> Unlike most macarons, I would serve these the same day I make them. The cheese has a lot of moisture that will make the shells soft.

This recipe is based on the recipe for cocoa macarons in Les Petits Macarons. (This is an excellent book, and their website also has a good video tutorial. Macarons are hard to get right and there are lots of details missing here. This is only a skeleton recipe!!) The almond meal and powdered sugar quantities are reduced because freeze-dried fruit powders tend to absorb a lot of water and make the batter too dry. The sugar is also reduced in the egg white mix because these are "savory," although if you go too far in reducing the sugar they won't work out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is the basic recipe; divide proportionally based on the actual weight of the egg whites:

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.

140 g almond meal
140 g powdered sugar
25 g tomato powder (used Denver Spice brand from Amazon)
Blend these together in food processor and sift into a bowl.

5 g powdered egg white
3 g cream of tartar
130 g granulated sugar (used caster sugar because most mac recipes call for it)
115 g aged room temp egg whites
Combine these four ingredients, and whip the mixture until stiff peaks form.

"Macaronage": combine the two mixtures, folding them together, until the result resembles lava. (This is what recipes always say.) Pipe the resulting lava-like mixture into circles on a silpat, and bang the tray on the counter to release air bubbles. It is helpful to watch videos if this is new to you.

200 degrees for 15 minutes, then 350 for 11 minutes.

For the filling: fresh goat cheese, with rosemary leaves chopped very fine, and mixed in some salt and pepper. </TEXT>

Butter and flour pan, pre-heat oven to 350F.

Combine 1.5C flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon salt, zest of a lemon.

In blender, combine 1/3C melted coconut oil, 1/4C honey, 2 room temp eggs, 3 or 4 mushy bananas, juice of 1/2 lemon. Blend em.

Mix blended wet ingredients into dry ingredients. Add 2 handfuls of shredded coconut and 2 handfuls of sliced almonds.

<TEXT> I scrambled yolks in place of the normal whole eggs in oyakodon, and then garnished the top with whole yolks when it was plated. The result isn't as "fluffy" as it is when you make it with the whites, but it is still tasty, and using a yolk as garnish on top at the end provides really great richness and texture. (You could also cured yolks grated on top like they were furikake, but I didn't.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Any signal processing that you do on a computer involves buffering to a greater or lesser extent. In order to pull spectrum information from a signal, you need enough history to "perceive" the frequencies as you go. But just because this introduces a delay doesn't mean that you can't make music with it in real-time. Think of it like singing in a cathedral - you can make the reverb work for you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mathematics exists as a third, abstract, "thing" that is distinct from both the physical universe and the human intellect (c.f. Plato, Roger Penrose, and numerous practicing mathematicians including Frenkel for supporting arguments). Were there no universe and no humans to discover theorems regarding counting, 3 would still be prime, just as falling trees always move air molecules in the forest...

Math as used by humans is an abstraction created by our collective history, a useful tool for science, and a thing of beauty, but none of these constructions actually capture the full essence of math in its raw state. Can the existence of such a distinct entity be proven? Nope. So just go ahead and label me a quack mystic and move on.

But it is still worth the read, and it may very well give you a glimpse into higher-level math; it has clearly been written with that as one of its goals. He makes a lot of great points as brief asides that are unfortunately often overshadowed by the narrative of events. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hah, well done!

Jeff gave me great advice on line weight, and he also pointed out that dashed lines rarely look good, while dots can look great. The dotted line includes the four points of the harmonic set, so you might think of it as the punchline for this construction. I thought that a dotted line would set it off well for that purpose.

<TEXT> A complete quadrangle (four points, no three on a line) implies six lines, which you see here. The dotted line is then defined by "diagonal points" of the quadrangle. The four points sectioned by this line form a harmonic set for the quadrangle, and have important geometric properties that, as you can tell, I could go on and on about. But I'll spare you the details. Projective geometry constructions can be very beautiful, yet spare. I think that makes them good candidates for ink? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So you have lots of existing music, which is good as demo material. On the music side of things, you can just start talking to people and showing them what you do. Indies are a likely bet.

You are probably missing demo material for the sound design side of things. Putting together a demo reel will also tell you if you like the process; sound design is very different than composing. You'll want to do both field recording based and synthesized kinds of sound if you are actually doing the final product. Another option is to specialize and sell specific varieties of sounds, bundled into packages, to be used by film/game people doing foley/fx. There is a biggish market that resembles the samples and loops market for music; engineers in it tend to be really into recording and post-processing. Don't know whether that describes you. If you are more of a synthesizer person, specializing in providing collections of electronic sounds would be the way to go, rather than doing game sound design directly (which also includes location ambience and acoustic sounds). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wan't making claims about percentages of academics using the language, I was just recommending it on its own merits. Haskell is surprisingly good (read: both decipherable and efficient) for computing *some* things. Have you ever actually given it a go? If not, you should try it, especially if you are designing algorithms. However, if all you are doing is making library calls, then it makes less sense...

FORTRAN, there's a choice that I hadn't thrown out there. THERE is a language with library support and stability, along with a certain vintage quality (despite which it is almost certainly a better choice than C++). 

C is always there, I suppose, and I've got to admit, it is usually my own language of choice for things that demand efficiency. </TEXT>

<TEXT> These might be too "classical" for you, but here you go.

Check google books for 19th century poets who were women: Alice Christiana Thompson Meynell, Sara Orne Jewett, Emily Dickenson, all the Brontes, Louise Guiney. There are also anthologies there that are out of copyright.

Here's a Meynell poem that could be excerpted, first-person, for example: http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/in-autumn/

Shakespeare's songs (from the plays) and sonnets (some from a female perspective) are short and classic. Also William Blake poems. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This happened to me and my reaction was to fall on the grenade.

A new very senior VP, who was not being accepted by the existing team, basically wanted to clean house and eventually replace people with his own crew. He planned to do this under the guise of "cost cutting," eliminating 50+ people.

I went to the owners of the company (who didn't know of the extent of the plans) and checked whether they thought it was a good idea. They didn't, and so they immediately started intervening with the VP who was going to cut folks. In the meantime, I went to the people about to be cut, many of whom worked for me, and warned them - some were able to jump to other gigs, some were able to survive politically. Some were let go, but not nearly as many as the big boss had wanted to eliminate. He was foiled, and super pissed off. I am still proud of this one, many years later.

Needless to say, I would *not* have been able to use this company as a ref with future employers. To solve this, three of us took off and started our own company as soon as we could, which gave us an excuse for not being able to get a good ref...

At the very least, you should warn people that you know are about to take out loans and that kind of thing, but only if you are SURE that the list won't change! Otherwise, treat it as a rumor with your associates, and start sussing out alternate jobs yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hadron, a brand-spanking-new, open source, hackable, granular synth for Ableton Live, has been released. It is a sophisticated synth, and it is kind of amazing that it even works at all, since its DSP functions are built in CSound and its UI is built in Max for Live. Complicated, but it works well enough. Nice. </TEXT>

Some people that go to Vegas beat the house, right? That is the nature of activities based on statistics - once in a while, somebody is lucky.

Also, there are a lot of people with a lot of money who game the system, and/or who prey upon the small investor. (Which is sometimes legal and sometimes...iffy...) </TEXT>

<TEXT> You cannot predict statistical "bad news" before it happens. Act of mother nature, criminal acts, etc etc. And these have huge impact on market. Even if you have perfect insider knowledge, you still get screwed by them in the long run.

Indexes are the way to go. In this case, you both profit and lose from the statistical nature of things, and in the long run, you make a little money.

Of course, if you just want to make bets and then live by the consequences, then the market is much more fun than a casino, because it is so complicated and there are so many factors to claim or blame. If you really want to make bets, then trade options! (I worked in options trading for years...) </TEXT>
