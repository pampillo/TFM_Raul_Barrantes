<TEXT> Middle Easterners are nowhere near the same level as those who came to the US and slaughtered natives. 

Like it's not even a close comparison. You're either really bad at keeping track of actual stats in Europe, or you failed history in school. The choice is yours as to which one it is, but if you plan on being part of the MAGA team, I'd suggest saying you don't know the factors of the outside world, because then you'd be on par with your leader.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Maybe all the years of research as an immunologist has disqualified me from liking this show. In scientific literature we are taught to deliver succinct information carefully selecting fewest words to get the message across in a meaningful way. I feel like a smart show should be able to create impact and convey the intended meaning in a simplistic fashion.

You're either a troll, or a pretentious twat. Either way, if the show is not for you, then just leave. The fanbase sure as shit won't miss someone with opinions like this. </TEXT>

Apart from the tank update, I don't recall them usually focusing on specific groups.

<TEXT>   It wasn't even weird or different which I think most people can accept. It was.... cheesy. Felt out of place.

It's most definitely weird. It's a woman having sex with people until she swallows them whole through her vagina. I really don't understand how you find it cheesy, that's not what cheesy means at all, it's simply weird. It's also far from out of place. 

Shadow was talking to tvs, sucked into a limo, hung from a tree only to be saved by something we haven't been shown yet (in a massive explosion of blood and gore), and the whole fantasy land he keeps drifting off to. 

Quite frankly, I'm amazed that it's the vagina scene that you find out of place. The show as a whole is making a very clear point as to being insane, going so far as getting Wednesday himself to convince Shadow. </TEXT>

I have a few questions though. How does the game determine the level of my first team? Do my normals effect it in any way? Can I play my draft pick games til 30 with someone from mid silver, and still have a clean slate for the type of player in my promo? Or will my first promo choose my tier of player?

Thanks for any guidance on this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's just so much wrong with what you're saying..

Why was he played that extremely wooden and emotionless?

This sums up the character of Shadow. He is very much there as a witness for the reader/viewer. 

So the guys wife died suddenly but a few hours after getting that news he is on a plane with Ian McShane's character exchanging cool guy one liners while looking slightly bummed out.

You may not understand how grief works. It can be experienced quite a few different ways. Also no idea why suddenly is in bold. 

Off to the bar with Pablo Schreiber character (The Leprechaun), more cool guy one liners while the fact that Schreiber's character's coin trick is magic was way to much on the nose and lasted way to long. And of course you can't have two meatheads in one scene without using the opportunity to have a fist fight.

Straight up setting up the character of Leprechaun. 

Honestly, if this wouldn't be based on a popular book by a popular author judging by just this pilot I would assume cheap SyFi channel show that get canceled after half a season.

The show's visuals alone are enough reason to ignore your opinion on the matter, but nonetheless, I hope you'll continue watching the show as a lot of your complains seem to be because it's the pilot, and it was designed to leave a lot of questions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I've been playing lately and considering we have to play on the new client, I'm trying to take full use of all the new features.

With that said.. Finding clips that I'd consider for the 3 spots available to look back upon, none of them really satisfy me. With every other role, there's that INSANE play you can grab. With support, while you may be playing it like "holy shit this is huge".. with most champs it simply doesn't look that way, unless it's a Thresh, Nami, Rakan, Bard maybe..

So yeah, I'd love to talk about what clips you'd throw into those spots just so I can get some kind of idea, rather than being a picky asshole like I usually am. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've played 3 games today, and always chose Play Again. After doing so, I'd go to flick the main role to the right for support, which sounds obvious right? But then I'd notice while I have my mouse button pressed down, the role selection box is in the bottom right section of the client and I'd end up choosing mid.

Looking back, I realize this was probably something that happened last night too simply because I got mid after going my typical Support/Fill. 

TLDR: The Role Selection window may be displaced so pay attention to where you flick your mouse. </TEXT>

Well that's ridiculous, especially given that you talked about them needed concept work "and shit". Are you trying to say the build up and the actual creation of the game isn't included in their time frame because you're talking about actual in game, building the framework kinda stuff aren't you?

I'm pretty sure there were some guys who were very happy with their finished product for the Campaign. Guys who liked the look of the map they made. Guys who designed the guns etc. 

Also, 5+ is implying Black Ops 2 and further back were bad games. I personally hold BO2 as one of the best there was. </TEXT>

See, this is just it. Sledgehammer have been working on this game for 3 years, not 6 fucking months. Activision have 3 seperate companies all release a game a year, and they rotate through a cycle. 

Sledgehammer gave us Advanced Warfare.

Treyarch gave us Black Ops 3. 

Infinity Ward gave us Infinite Warfare.

So now, 3 years after releasing Advanced Warfare, this is what they're giving us. </TEXT>

I feel this is just an unfair thing to say. Activision are the global behemoth that can print their own money, but the companies like Sledgehammer, Treyarch, Infinity Ward.. As much as they put out disappointing games in the last few years, I find it very hard to believe the people working on the games actually aimed at the lowest effort, easiest release there is.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> But you know of these hobbies, jobs, footware in thailand because of the internet. Something people in their second half of life simply don't use too often. They get their news from the prompt they read, and the gossip on set. They don't go to Reddit and google to learn new shit. 

Also, even though I'm saying you know it all from the internet, I genuinely refuse to believe even you have an ego big enough to assume you know every job/hobby/piece of clothing on the planet. Using the footware in Thailand worked because it's rather niche to know that, but that in no way backs up what you're saying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So it's been a while since I've been in tune with Cod, but they have a 3 year rotation right? So it goes: Sledgehammer, Treyarch, Infinity Ward. Sledgehammer have been making this game, either since the release of Advanced Warfare, or the release of Black Ops 3. 

Battlefield 1 came out late 2016. That means Sledgehammer started working on this game, at minimum, 1 year before the release of that game.  (not including all of the brainstorms and planning that happened before production, that most likely started taking place as they shipped their own version 3 years ago)

Believe me, I understand how the past few games have had a leach sucking the fumes of cash out of the games, but you can't say this game is happening simply because of the success of Battlefield 1. There were cries for a WW1/2 game for a while before the release of it, it just took Cod longer because of their god awful rotation system.  </TEXT>

I was having a legitimate talk about my point, and when I was wrong I proved it, I said I may have misread it, then we discussed something else, but you've just slowly become more and more of a dick as we've messaged back and forth. 

Most of what you're saying now is pointless. You wrote two seperate sentences about my thoughts on him being casual, and ending the sentence with fucking stupid, because for some reason we're now cursing to emphasize our points. You also contradicted yourself with: 

  I proved you wrong with my first comment and you admitted you were wrong

and

Let's hear you be the mature one and admit it now. Go on, wise one.

Also, given your general tone progression throughout this endeavor, I genuinely doubt " I only continued the conversation for entertainment" is true, given that it's not like you're ramping me up and annoying me, but it's clear it hit a spot with you.

<TEXT> You do realize there's a big difference between companies like Respawn and companies like dice right? It's not just EA it's who is actually making the game and dice has been shit recently.

I'm with you on this. I've been looking at past EA games to receive shit. They're all DICE.. Battlefield 4, Battlefront, Battlefield 3. But it's always EA to take the hit in the eyes of Reddit. 

You said they fixed battlefront 1 problems which is the farthest thing from the truth. The game is still shit and divided. 

So is there anything to back this up? Yeah, the people are divided, and yes they may not allow ground to air/ air to ground, but a lot of the flaws and cries from the community have been added and fixed. You simply can't deny that. 

 Instead we will get people camping the main menu for a vehicle to Respawn like in battlefield 1. 

That's not my BF1 experience at all. While some people may do that, and that only, there is never a lack of on the ground players. 

What they did do however is give up on battlefront one because "fuck it we got out money"

This is just a shitty thing to do and I'm with you on it.

Hopefully this reply isn't downvoted because I'm defending a new EA game like my first comment was, but if you see from my replies to each point, I'm not a blind fan who is going to pre-order  instantly, I'm just seeing some potential and whatnot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry, but have you paid any attention to it? 

I'll link [this thread from /r/gaming] (https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/66cr5z/baby_dont_hurt_me/) 

From what I've seen so far, they, and yes, they being EA, seem to have tried fixing most of the flaws with the first game. 

Believe me I understand the first one was underwhelming, but since the release of Battlefront, name a game that was widely renowned as an awful game. Because since then, I've seen Titanfall 2, Battlefield 1, Unravel, Mirrors Edge Catalyst. 

EA are still the money hungry tyrant, sure, but that doesn't mean their games are going to be lazy cash grabs. Give the game more than a trailer before deciding everything outside the graphics are awful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> See, this, while it is pretty unhealthy, is also nothing like what is happening in their content. 

Did you and your brother hit each other for new toys? Did you ever throw him off the trampoline thinking "Maybe I'll be the star of this video and get something new"? 

Not only are they abusive parents, but they are teaching their children to abuse each other when the camera is on because it'll get views and be rewarded. They literally had a video up based on the kids slapping each other in some weird competition, and the dads message was "hey! You don't slap girls!!! But she's your sister so that doesn't count." Guess what. The kid proceeds to slap his sister pretty fucking hard, and she just lays on the bed crying while the dad gives the typical prank "ohhhh" reaction. 

I genuinely do no care to talk about your childhood, because I somewhat get it. I didn't play as rough as you apparently, but in bickering is a thing. This DaddyofFive thing is not even close to the same case. He has brainwashed his children with toys and goodies as long as they do WHATEVER the fuck he wants. </TEXT>

<TEXT> .. Did you even read my comment? My biggest point was that I'm not judging their viewers, I was just taking a reasonable guess at their core audience. 

Like with PewDiePie. If you watched his content 2 years ago, you could see it's very clearly aimed at a viewer under the age of 14 or so. But now, you watch his content and he's changed to appeal for that late teen, early 20s viewer. 

But going off an hour of content with Cow Chop, it's clear they just assumed they'd be their normal selves, rather than ease into a new viewer base, and sure, it may have worked for some viewers, but I just got the vibe from them that they appeal to people around the age of 15, but being the cool dudes who do whatever they want. (EDIT: Which, once again to be clear, is not a bad thing. People have to appeal to that demographic, and if you're not in that range but still watch them, you do you. I'm just saying every channel has a target, and I'm guessing mid-teens is theirs) </TEXT>

<TITLE> How would you describe/summarize each class? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-17 01:52:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm choosing a class, and right now I'm leaning on Jedi Knight simply because I want that 'classic' feel. I also tend to lean towards tanks, so there's that too. 

With that being said, I'd love some class rundowns. I understand there is a page devoted to this on the website, but it doesn't tell you how the class feels, if that makes any sense.

For example, I've played Rogue in WoW, and Burglar in Lotro. Shadow seems to be this game's version of that, but Shadow can also tank/heal/dps.. And given how different Rogue is to Burglar, assuming that dps Shadow is the same as Rogue/Burglar is kind of tricky. 

Being honest, I just want the game as a single player experience and have a lightsaber. I just don't know which class can manage that the best. I'd expect a spellcasting jedi class to be tricky to quest with at certain points, and it would also limit my saber fighting. 

This got really jumbled, but I hope someone understands what I was going for. Thanks for any help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> After years of constantly sanding by "i won't support something i don't use/like" it realllyyyyyyyy rubbed me the wrong way that they got a gaming sponsor from Dell. I legitimately feel bad for anyone who uses this as an entrance to getting a gaming pc.

EDIT: Yes, I know the "money's there ___" thing.I also know it was said on the YOLO Boys episode, so there's more humor to it than people say. Woody has also definitely given a "trust me, i believe in it" feel to his sponsors in the past. They're also Dell PCs. Overpriced shit, and the guys know that, but continue to push it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've heard the manga is incredibly confusing or sloppy compared to the show. Of course that was the opinion of a single person, who tried it quite a long time ago, but nonetheless that's what I've heard.

EDIT: So... It seems like I've been wrong about the TG manga, and after looking into it. 117 chapters seems totally doable. Looks like I have entertainment for tonight, although it't not anime like the original plan. Thank you guys! </TEXT>

The average high-level soccer(football depending on who you are) is probably 50k+ or more, and that's the low bar, considering the biggest in the UK is 90k, and second highest is 76k. That is also ignoring a lot of the straight up goliath stadiums out there, and on top of that, you have NFL stadiums too.  </TEXT>

Every time I see one of his video's come out I always go in genuinely wanting to enjoy it, but by the time he gets in the air the audio drops so far in quality that it's hard to listen to and I end up skipping along to see if it gets better, or if he has more on-foot/studio audio and I always leave feeling kinda sad I can't ignore the audio.

With that said, I also understand it's something he's very aware of, and if so, it's a damn shame he can't fix it. Maybe I'll try again in a few vids and see if it's any better I guess. 

This vid did have an incredible view though.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just got done watching Silence and absolutely loved it, but the best part for me was easily the side of the movie focused on Japan's heritage, it's way of life, and being realistic.. I just love Japan. 

So I'd appreciate any recommendations that can fill in the void I have right now. I've often found myself on Youtube straight up searching "Japanese history" but I always end up on a video that requires viewing (I do a lot of driving/travelling) and it falls flat.

Thanks for any suggestions! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a deep love for GoT, and I enjoy CK2. I haven't fully delved into the base game, but I bought some dlc around Christmas. I have: 

Legacy of Rome, Way of Life, Ruler Designer, The Old Gods, Charlemagne, South Indian Portraits. 

I've looked into the mod a bit and it says Sword of Islam adds in horses for the Dothraki, and I'd feel weird playing without such a thing, but even with the sale, I'm in no real position to buy any more dlc. 

So, how enjoyable is the game with only half or less of the DLCs? </TEXT>

That Pepsi ad fuckup was pretty funny. Having already seen it I was baffled that it took them a few minutes to realize that riot footage was not the actual ad, then to follow it up with the wrong ad the second time was pretty funny. 

Also, thinking back on it.. It was very odd for Woody to not get too specific about who the family member in the army was. Hasn't he brought him up multiple times in the past?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not even closely related. 

Drawing gay clown Putin is a straight up fuck you to one specific person because of his out dated and obnoxious ideals.

Drawing Muhammad is simply not giving a fuck you to anyone. And if it's a Muhammad drawing like the one that caused the drama in France way back when, then it's just being an asshole to be an asshole, and that's not even targeting someone. It'd just offend an entire religion for no reason. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been looking at posts that talk about going to the config file and searching for ____, but it appears to be that a lot of those search terms are missing. For example, I've looked into texture_quality, and it's not an option that appears.

I'd love to give this game a shot, but I already find it clunky to play, and the low fps is making the adjustment way too big a' struggle. Thanks for any help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a 1 year old Husky, and lately I've realized most of my clothes and furniture have hairs on, or around them, and this is new to me. I've tried brushing her thoroughly, I've tried washing her down with water while brushing, I tried dog shampoo to clean her coat, followed by more brushing.. Absolutely nothing works. 

I'd much rather keep her indoors, but it's getting pretty noticeable so I've had her in her kennel lately when I'm not walking her or letting her roam the garden.

<TEXT> That's just it though, isn't it? You can predict most of the movie just by the premise and cast etc. The only thing we didn't expect was probably the suit situation, but it being a Marvel movie means it can only really go so many ways, and we all agree on that, but once they show it, everyone begins to shout about it spoiling too much, as if we didn't know to begin with. 

It's like with Justice League. Absolutely everyone agress Superman is going to show up at some point. Shit, most of the comments are about how he WASN'T revealed yet. So by proxy of it, we all know he's in the movie, yet for some reason, when he finally shows up in a trailer down the line, everyone will go crazy saying it's spoiling the entire movie. 

Reddit baffles me with trailer thoughts sometimes.  </TEXT>

If they spread beyond that I'm sure there'd be a downfall to some degree. Shit, I'd pay 20 a month if it came to Ireland, just because I'd get to watch episodes live without having to find a shitty stream and then torrent a HD version later..

Release it digitally? Okay, and now it's on a torrent site. Ship out discs? Oh look, someone ripped and uploaded it to a torrent site AND you have to pay for shipping/production cost of day-one discs.

I'd enjoy it in specific cases, whether it be I'm not close to a theater of my liking, or I'm stuck in bed sick.. But no way this could ever be profitable for those selling the movie. </TEXT>

Because the writing is easily some of the worst writing I've ever seen in a show, and that's from someone who enjoyed the opening few episodes and the premise. I honestly believe I ignored the negatives, just to go against the hate the show was getting, and enjoyed it because it's a Netflix show. Nope. After about 6 episodes I finally caved and noticed the absurd amount of flaws. 

There are just wayyyy too many flaws for it to be considered as good as DDs2, but I'd just about agree with it being Luke Cage leverl. </TEXT>

There are 2 modems in the house. One has a router setup with it, near my front door. I have another router so I was curious about setting it up at modem 2 upstairs. Considering I have to pay for it, I'll pass. 

On that, I wanted to know if I took router 1 away from modem 1, could I connect it to modem 2 upstairs, or would there be some weird installation flaw that stops that from working.

I know my wording is really off and whatnot, and considering I spend most of my life at a desk I hate how out the of the loop I am here, but also don't wanna just say "ah fuck it, plug it in" only for everything to crash and burn. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm moving in the next week or so and I'm organizing where my wifi is setup. There is of course the modem in the hallway, and that's where the guy installed it, but looking around, I found a modem in what I guess was the office room. 

So my questions are: 

I have two routers. If I plug the second router upstairs, while the first is setup downstairs, will this cause some problems? I've heard unless the provider knows of this modem, it may just stop working throughout the house.

Also, if I were to move the downstairs router to the upstairs setup, will it work? Or was the installation process focused on the bottom floor modem?

Thanks for any help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I played blitz/thresh/Nautilus a lot last season. Those 3 champs probably had 80% of my ranked games just because i loved the incredible engage style. 

This season however I've gone to peel supports, and up until about a week or two ago a blitz was a pretty rare sight, but damn when he's played now I get spooked.

I have about 4k hours in the game so I feel it's fair to say i know for the most part what an abilities range is. Not the actual numbers but an in-game feel to it. 

But with that said... I can't help but think "he's out of range" or "I'm behind this wave" right before getting hooked by the 3 champs I listed. Shit, even once getting behind basw wall, legitimately around the corner, only for Naut to drag me back into lane. 

So have any others, preferably bot/supp mains noticed this? Thanks for any thoughts. </TEXT>

How do you feel these 2 points hold true?

If you're talking about Bruce killing people, that feeds right into the mystery that is WHY he is killing people, therefore giving his character some depth and a past, while also seeing as most believe Joker killed his partner, he jumped off the deep end, and Alfred himself said so in the movie, giving him actual motivation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My pay was late today and won't be here til the end of the week. Seeing as I have living expenses and whatnot this is really fucking me over. So I kinda feel like to make it I need to ask her for cash, and in reality, I have only did this once before, and considering she knows I'm good for it she was completely fine doing this. 

With that said, my mam was a real piece of shit when it came to lending money/ asking for money and whatnot, so the whole "I'll give it back in a few days" agreement among people is really dirty in my eyes. Not in the sense of it being a shitty idea, but I'm always afraid to ask because I know what she's like.

But yeah, I rambled for a bit, but also feel it's necessary for my side of the question. Thanks for any thoughts! </TEXT>

Everyone flipped out at the Doomsday release for BvS trailer, and there is no actual announcement to the villain in this trailer, but I've seen Ares' name probably a dozen times basically talking like he's 99% the villain of this movie.

So can someone help me figure out how it'd be so bad to show Ares in a trailer coming up, given that most people who know the character, believe he'll be the villain. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-03-12 00:11:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been bouncing around classes/races for a few days now trying to find one that fits my style, and one that may appeal to me is Guardian. I love the idea of Guardian Hobbit, especially because of the whole Sam Gamgee aspect. 

But on that, I asked in world chat once how slow it was compared to Warden, a class I briefly played, and they said it wasn't even comparable. The Guardian is simply the slowest class in the game by a large reach. 

But... This has to be hyperbolic right? I don't mind slow, but the way people make it seem... I should probably trust them, but given that I was tank Warden, hearing that a class is 100x, 1000x slower than the bleeds and playstyle of that class tree, I find it hard to accept.

Thanks for any opinions on the matter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you crazy? 

Season 5 was a really good season, it just got held down by the shitty Sandsnake plot. Remove that and you have: 

Mance's infamous death scene. Arya found the house of black and white. Sansa started her journey with Ramsay. Tyrion got kidnapped by Jorah. Jorah then gets infected with greyscale. Aemon dies. Jon goes to Hardhome. Then the entire episode of Hardhome. Jon kills a fucking White Walker for gods sake.  Dany rides Drogon. Cersei does the walk of shame. The season then ends with Jon dying, Arya blind, a dead Stannis, a dead Myrcella, Dany is missing, and Sam is off to become a Maester. 

Season 6 was truly incredible, but don't let that, and the Sand Snakes, take away from all the Season 5 did.  </TEXT>

Thanks!

Nope. That would be the complete lack of interest in gaining any form of growth from the hosts themselves. 

Other podcast's are always given a shout out simply because the guest decides to. 

Most common guests on PKA always mention it. PhillyD, Tucker, Boogier, Kweblle, all of these guys are tweeting about the night of recording and whatnot. Hutch himself even said in a vid or a tweet once that he was on and people should go watch. 

Forcing someone to give the podcast a shout out is a terrible way of introducing them to the show's style. Nobody wants to be given a job to do after being invited to chill for a while. </TEXT>

<TEXT> recommendations for something as good as this.

That depends entirely on what you want. Harry Potter is 8 movies long and gives you a connection to the characters just as much. 

Star Wars may also do it for you.

Game of Thrones is the closest fantasy epic but that's both a TV show, and veryyyy different from Lotr. 

In reality, even with my suggestions, it all depends on taste. You could do all the marvel movies. The x-men movies. The fast and furious movies. Take a franchise and watch it. Odds are, one of them will hit the spot you want. </TEXT>

Nope. It just happened to turn out as one of the most brilliantly crafted pieces of music on tv, and quite frankly it still is IMO.

And before any of you ask why I'm on dodgy streams for the show, HBOGo, and HBONow, whatever else they have, is not available in my country so I'm forced to watch shitty 480p streams until I can get a 1080p version to download. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I saved my comment to come back after work, which happens to be now, and looking into it a bit more, I found [this] (http://i.imgur.com/lJZazjo.png)

So in finding this, it seems like there are waaaaaay more books than I imagined, and when you suggest something like Mistborn, the following books are in the order listed about right? 

Or is Mistborn the name given for the overall series in the sense that A Song of Ice and Fire is the title given to the series with Game of Thrones, Clash of Kings etc. 

Also, looking at it from an outside perspective, it seems Elantris is the easiest place to start, although it may not be his best or most grand tale, and given the color scheme of suggested vs must read... The linear story setup seems to be out the window and I'm confused/overwhelmed by it. 

You may not be here to help, but hopefully someone will read my reply and help me figure this out.  </TEXT>

So why don't you, someone with direct and constant communication with the guys, tell one of them to record it, or you yourself record it given that you're always in the chat anyway. 

people wonder why no one enjoys coming to this subreddit or engaging with people, the people always jump to conclusions.

It's not jumping to conclusions. The PKA Patreon has existed for nearly 3 years. Promises were made, ideas were given up, plans were thrown out to the fans. So far we've had 3 trips. Yes, PKN is consistent and I appreciate that, but where are the ringtones. Where are the meetups? The trips? Shit, even the hangouts are pretty inconsistent.

Don't get me wrong Chiz, I've always appreciated what you've done for the show in terms of sponsors and guests, but you can't act high and mighty on this one. You guys are in the wrong here, and treating the fans like a bunch of idiots who cry wolf constantly is not the way to go about this. </TEXT>

What a shame too. It's continuing to spiral downward for the Netflix/Marvelverse.

<TEXT> Treat PKA like a normal podcast and stop giving them money if you have a problem rather than fill the subreddit with butthurt crying.

Nobody is upset about the podcast. It's the lies and promises they made that have people in an uproar, along with the baffling ignorance Woody is applying on the matter. He clearly fucking browses the sub and does it at least once or twice a week, yet he calls himself an idiot for visiting the haters. 

The one place on the internet that is devoted to the podcast is simply a collection of haters in his mind and fans are tired of it. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-03-08 00:04:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm working my way through LOTR right now, and while it's wonderful, I'm been really drawn in by Children of Hurin. I've heard slight details of the story through my time here and r/lotr, but I've also heard the Silmarillion is pretty necessary for it given that it provides a significant amount of backstory and leadup to the events in CoH.

So, I thought I'd ask you guys. How much sense would CoH make without reading Sil before hand? Or is it possible to choose a few chapters among the Sil to read before CoH, without reading all of the Sil?

Thanks for any thoughts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Shadow of Mordor is great on ps4. Fluid, great graphics, load times are wonderful.

Shadow of Mordor on ps3 however... Loading into menu takes 5-10 seconds. Loading into game/zone takes about 30. Sometimes you'd be running into an orc 'village' and some of the wooden textures wouldn't load, so instead of climbing the side of a shack that has planks along the sides to hold it up, and of course for you to cling to, it's just a brown/green mesh. I'll try find images.

EDIT: This isn't Shadow of Mordor, but this is the kind of texture bug I was talking about, and it happens every 20-30 minutes on older consoles. [Here] (http://i.imgur.com/IWfZ5bd.jpg) </TEXT>

I remember back when it was on everyone's mind I brushed it off as a musical, and a musical I would never see at that. 

Then I stumbled across the soundtrack a few days ago, listened to the first song about a dozen times and then realized there are 2 more hours to listen to. I'm baffled by how well it tells the story through music and music alone.  </TEXT>

I never said he's depressed. He himself said in an AMA he has never been depressed, and would never claim to be. What I am pointing to is that he also said he started to have panic attacks on stage, and his Kanye bit in Make Happy was a real way to confront it and it helped him manage with his struggle a bit more. 

Don't get me wrong, I know his act is incredibly well thought out, and a lot of it is a mixture of irony and self inflection, but nonetheless, I've always seen him as a guy with a whole lot of conflicting thoughts in his head due to the life he leads. </TEXT>

I met him about 13 years later, and it turns out he has another family. The fun part is that they seems to be incredibly, incredibly happy and his two daughters were these incredibly popular school athletes. Turns out he did the whole "I'm raise you to be the best you can possibly be" thing.

Of course I'll always be slightly jealous that I was too soon, but considering a lot of people give runaways dad's shit, it was really entertaining to hear how he turned it all around at attempt 2.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone talking about Scarce being a great guest and I'm here wondering what they see. All I've heard so far is a real shitty attempt at money bragging, and how it's lost value in his eyes. How he's genuinely considered liposuction because the hot women he spends time with tell him they've all done it, and he wants to look good but enjoys food too much. Although admittedly he said he's been losing weight recently so props to him on starting somewhere. 

All of that, and to top it off with his channel basically being a modern day Keemstar, I'm baffled people want him on here. 

I'm also not finished the episode, so my opinion on him may do a 180, but as of right now I really don't see the praise.  </TEXT>

This movie has a very, very significant amount of limb chopping, a lot of skulls end up with claws through them, and the swearing is made very noticeable. 

It's probably a bit darker than deadpool in terms of violence, the story is pretty heavy overall, and there's a slight bit of nudity. 

All in all.. I'd skip this one with him. Or at least see it once yourself then make the judgement call. </TEXT>

I remember before Civil War I tried to read it and people said it's pretty bad and not really worth reading. Does IW follow the same pattern, or is this an actual great story? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm fine with it being a fuck you to other movies though. Marvel's cinematic universe to me is the upbeat, go to action flick that will be enjoyed by most of the family. While I'd absolutely for a whole bunch of the cast to be killed off in Infinity War, I feel the MCU is the place I go to get that "they can do anything. They are true superheroes" kinda feel.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm pretty certain it had to do with Charles' whole "I'm fucking 90" thing. The guy needed a real rest, and yes, I'm sure both he and Logan knew of the risk, but Charles had one goal throughout this movie. To make sure Logan realized what happiness was, and staying with a family, embracing that bit of life for however long, was a risk worth taking in his eyes. </TEXT>

Given that the movie was about his daughter that was bred to be a killer, I don't see why seeing the next step which was a clone of him (easily the most known mutant in the universe), along with the clone's creator being the son of Logan's evil doctor.. It really makes sense. </TEXT>

So now on my alt, I'm trying to get some world exploring done. Going for actual explore achievements too along the way. 

But sadly, its clear than in doing most quests, I'll be a pretty high level going to the following zone, and after 2-3 zones I'll be outleveling 4-5-6. 

So to avoid missing the great quests or beautiful zones, id like to know I need to go to them when im on level. 

So Reddit. What are those zones?

<TEXT> I don't think that's it.

I believe he had a story. A truly great one, but the show crushed it. Not in the sense that the show is better, but the show gathered a following nobody ever expected, and it gave the books a popularity it quite frankly would never have seen without the adaption being so big.

Then, along with all the new readers, it became a very popular thing to theorize about the future of the series. He himself said he stopped reading fan predictions because of something like "if they say this happens, then I can't actually right that in like I planned because he said it". That may be a drastic paraphrase, but nonetheless I'd imagine the point stands.

He started a story that has gotten way beyond his reach, and he is absolutely terrified to finish it. Like, when is the last time the release of a book has been as big a deal as Winds of Winter? ~~Maybe Deathly Hallows? But even then, it absolutely pales in comparison to the following of Winds~~. As palindrome has stated, I'm way off on this and my sphere of opinions/information is pretty warped compared to what I knew of the Potter releases.

Now, for the riskiest part of the comment. I am fine with him not finishing it. He gave us the world, he gave us most of the story. He has no true obligation to finish the series for us. We did not pay him for an entire series. Of course it's truly heartbreaking that he may never finish it, but after what he has given me personally.. I'd rather he admit his plans to not finish the series, and move on to something that will make him happy, rather than aching and stressing over a story, that because of the fanbase, already has hundreds/thousands of endings. One of them has to be his, and because it's already out there somewhere I don't imagine he'd ever be happy putting his own words to it.  </TEXT>

This always amazes me. I didn't expect much going into a musical, but I left with a true sense of awe that I've never really felt leaving the theater, but when it comes to explaining to a friend why he should give it a shot... I can't explain it, and I'm always left speechless. </TEXT>

Gibson got 49.% for it.. Like what did he do to cause such a clear agreement for him being undeserving? Are people still mad at him, or is there a director that got snubbed by his placement?

<TEXT> So um...Kyle is clinging way too hard with Trump right? 

I may be wrong, but it's very, very fucking clear at this point that he tries to flip any news of him into either way too insane for a serious talk, or something that benefits him. Playing on his own course because "imagine if he didn't". Being overweight is okay but once he's fat it's not okay anymore..Pretty sure he's fat. Also, relating to him on a level because he eats shitty fast food is crazy IMO.

EDIT: Lol at Woody saying life ain't fair though, considering you know, the whole world was against him and his channel when he was trying to make it work. Rather....Unfair even, if you asked him back then.

Don't get me wrong, I'll admit to being critical, if not over critical of him in the past, but the hate on this sub is incredibly hyperbolic when he mentions it.

It could well become my main down the road because I like the look of the class, but I also feel somewhat loyal to my current realm because of passing gold around when needed, along with crafting reagents, and just in general I like having them on the same realm. On the other hand, I know if we're on different realms we can't really trade anything unless in a dungeon. 

Thanks for any advice.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> While on the topic of mages, what is arcane like?

<TEXT> Huh. 

I've felt the opposite about it. It was my first tank, and I always imagined because of stagger it was a much easier class to make mistakes on. I don't mean with huge hits, but the fact that we could delete damage was great for me. The only time I really find the class hard is when there are huge hits incoming, and as far as I know, that's a very wellknown issue among the class. The fault with as other specs have faults.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I searched up a few terms on here to see how the class is doing because it's my main right now. And by main, I mean it's the only class I have above 100, quite frankly about 30 (my pally) and so far, I've really, really enjoyed the class. I love how mobile it is. How easy it is to aggro, along with the self efficiency for soloing. 

Then I saw [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/54wiy7/blizzard_can_you_just_remove_brewmaster_from_the/) and started questioning what's up. Is the spec really in that much of a bad state? Was this before 7.1.5? Was this hyperbole, or realistic with slight exaggeration? 

I'd love some thoughts on the spec. Not so I can abandon it, but so I can get an idea of if I should juggle in another class or not. I don't plan on any high level raids, but I'd love to be considered as a reliable addition to the party. Thanks for any opinions,

(PS: I tried frost mage once in class trial and didn't enjoy it. How different is arcane? the class interests me, but I'm not a fan of early game mage so the grind is something I'd avoid if it turns out I don't like the class) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Are there certain classes that are straight up superior when doing world questing? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-14 04:46:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'd love to world quest, but I'm also a big fan of healing. Personally, I've struggled with world questing on a healing spec since I picked up the game and don't see that changing. Because of that, I can't decide on a dps class, as I've never really thought about them much and I'm painfully indecisive. 

So for example, I'm curious about the look of Shaman. But I'm also very weary of ranged classes because I feel if they get caught out or get in melee range, it's gonna be a pain to deal with. (the melee Shaman seems way too "buff this basic attack animation" for me).

I'd love some suggestions. I really want to quest the older expansions, but if the answer is Demon Hunter then I'd be willing to pick up Legion sooner than planned.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So the first time I played to 100 a few years back I just played hunter, and did the whole 1-5 thing with basics, shift, and alt. 

Now though, I'm looking to be ready for end game instead of being spooked by it, and I'm wondering what the best keybind setup would be. 

I've seen people replace q-e-s for spells sometimes, and simply use cam to move with W. I'm not sure how useful that would be overall, and help is much appreciated. Thanks! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been looking into making an alt lately, but I really can't decide on another race. I've come to know the stats are a pointless thing to focus on, and it should just be the look that appeals to you most. 

With that.. I can't help but wanting to go human each time. My original character way back when was Human, right now it's a draenei, but looking for my next char.. I can't help but want human again. 

Nothing else really appeals to me, and the zones are all pretty weak when I compare them to Elwynn Forest. Of course other's may feel different but just love running around it. 

Buuuutt.. I also don't want to get 5-6 characters in and have all my characters be Human, as it feels incredibly basic, but damn I can't shake the feeling of them just looking great as everything. 

Thanks for any thoughts! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So after last season, I was lost. The fact that they were filming in Winter killed me because I knew it'd take longer. Then I luckily had a full rewatch of the series with a friend of mine who was new to it, so getting to indulge in her questions was just a wonderful way to keep the world fresh for me. 

Then I dropped all thoughts of it. I always try, to make sure it's not a long year. I don't come to this sub too often, but when it comes to a conversation about it, I can't pass it up.

Anyway, it's around that time of year when we get a trailer. We won't be getting one any time soon I'd imagine, but nonetheless, the feeling of awe is encroaching on my life now. I just watched a clip or two from season 1 and I had that "And this is why I love GoT" moment. It wasn't anything wonderful, but just the simple Ned-Rob conversation on the way to King's Landing. I had forgotten how much time I've given to the show, the books, the mods, the games, the talks.. How emotionally wrecked I was watching the Jon reveal, seeing Dany's ships actually going to Westeros. Of course it was a bit of a joke, "she's finally coming, hurdur".. But it's true. Dany will actually land in Westeros within the next 6-7 months of our lives, and I can't hold back how I feel about it. 

This post may be pointless to a lot of people, but I feel a good vent could get you in the mood too, or just get you excited for what's to come.

I'd love to hear your thoughts down below. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [S05E10] Why is everyone so mad after 1 episode? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I get it, a lot of you hate Felicity. I've hated her too, but quite frankly, I'm sick of this sub giving her shit. She was right this episode. Yes, she was right most of last season because of bullshit writing, but last night, she was legitimately in the right, and the camera/writing really made it noticeable. From the second she meets Black Siren she is calling the bluff. Then we get a shot of her working on a punching bag. So quite frankly, I'm not even that mad about the punch.

As for the new BCs intro.. Yeah it was weak, but it's also a character intro. How many characters have been introduced through a 3 second clip that is cliche as hell? Give her a real chance.

It's okay for a character outside Oliver to be right. And I get that a sentence like that seems like an Olicitard, but believe me when I say I'm not. I left last season because of it. 

This season has been fucking great though. We've had 9 solid episodes, so to see people say they're out and done already, after one episode of a character on the main team having a "power moment" if we wanna call it that... I just don't understand it. 

I'll agree it's been a weak episode in comparison to this season, but for fuck sake, it's really not worth jumping ship over. Calm down. Sometimes this sub is as toxic, if not more toxic than Olicity shippers. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been playing about a week, and I'm probably 20 games in. (I clocked in a few hours over the years but never went beyond a game or two every few months)

But I've found myself playing on Agility champions. I've played Nukers, Pushers, Carry, but all only on the Agility focused heroes. 

So is this a normal thing to do? I understand you have your tanks, carry, supports, junglers etc. Is what I'm doing okay? 

Even though I come from another MOBA, I have absolutely no idea what's going on most of the time when it comes to builds and jungle routes/clear style (I go by the latest 7.0 builds, but I have no idea why I'm building what I build)

So I'd love some advice. Should I branch out and try a game or two in Strength, Intelligence, or should I learn the Agility builds/items before adding in a new hill to climb?

Thanks for any help. Loving the game so far, and hoping to delve further in. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'll be picking up a PS4 soon, and I'm in a position to pick up one full price game. My three options are: Overwatch, Battlefield 1, and Titanfall2.

I'm trying to decide on one, but no matter how many trailers I watch, or reviews, I really can't narrow it down.

I know one of the upcoming answers may be "whatever looks the most appealing to you" or something like it, but as much as I hate to admit it, I am incredibly indecisive, so I'm looking for thoughts on the gameplay, playerbase, learning curve, and how long it'll last before going dull. (I say that last one because of the first Titanfall game)

So to those of you that play them, can you give me some thoughts please? Thanks!

PS: This won't be my only game, I have another few already, but this will be the game I pick up with the console. 

EDIT: Post says 3 comments, but only has 1.. I wonder what they're saying from the void. </TEXT>

So, with that said, I've always taken a minute or two to look at jobs like Assistant accountant, personal assistant, cabin crew for ___ airline. 

I've always skipped on them, because of a slight line or two in the "must haves" section, that makes me wonder how much of an idiot or fool I'd be to try get that place, or if I fit it both in personality, and looks quite frankly. Some may say looks mean nothing for a job, but I feel they very much do when it comes to certain matters. 

So I'd really appreciate any help you guys have to try nudge me over this wall I'm at. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So basically, I've just realized after 20 years in the country (give or take), I've seen fuck all of it. And with that, I plan on going west. That being said.. I don't drive. So I'm looking to a bus or train ride, and quite frankly, that seems way more appealing to me, because if it's like I imagine, it'll be beautiful at times. 

What I'm looking to know would be in regards to stuff like the bus' themselves. The room, the comfort, on board services etc. The same going for the train. 

Then how is getting from bus to bus, or train to train, because I imagine it won't really be a one stop thing. Although, being honest, I came here before putting in real research, to make sure this is something that won't destroy me after giving real time and resources to it. 

I'd just love some guidance, as someone who will be travelling the country for the first time, and really has no idea what to do, or where to start, but I know I have to before I regret it later in life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before I read Geoff Johns' ominbus for Hal's run (only up until Sinestro War) I really didn't care for Hal, or the GLs in general, but afterwards, I was in love. It's easily my favorite run of all time.

With that said, I remember during the Rebirth livestream that Hal's run would be gutted alive because of the writer, but I don't remember the comments on Green Lanterns.

That being the context.. I am really, really enjoying both of the runs. When Rebirth started, I gave everyone a shot. I picked up some new reads, I've learned to like some new characters..But the quality of both these runs is shocking me. Now, in all honesty, I'm only on 11# of both runs, so there is time for it to go wrong, but Hal's will bomb, and this Phantom Ring stuff.. I may be in the minority, because I don't have any opinions on what I read yet, but this is just wonderful IMO.

I'd love to hear thoughts, and if they're negative, I'd love to hear what you find wrong with each series. If not, I'd quite frankly still love to hear how you guys feel, as I've missed out on a lot of Weekly Discussions.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Here's the list] (http://www.readingorders.com/Collections/GreenLantern)

I'd like to pick back up where I left off, but I'm really not sure how the reading order goes. How good is this one? I remember in the omnibus, volume 1, it didn't do entire issues at once, it rather jumped between issues and mixed it up for the best story.

How well does this do the job? And is there anything you feel is missing, or something unnecessary, please tell me so I can get the most out of the story. Thanks!

Also how important are the side issues after New 52? Like GLC, Red Lanterns, New Guardians etc. Hal's journey with Geoff ends in Volume 3 of GL I believe, but New Guardians ends at volume 40? Do I continue that to get the most out of the Guardian story, or do I even to read that? I'd really love some advice as I'm genuinely lost, and really overwhelmed by all of this. Thanks!

Then at times I try continue reading it like it's normal text, but it seems wrong to do, not because I feel people choose to sing, but because it simply feels wrong to do, if that makes sense.

So after passing the tale of Beren and Luthien I realized I need a plan for this to enjoy it as best I can. Any ideas are welcome, thanks! </TEXT>

I know there is a version matching that set, along with a Children of Hurin match too, which would be convenient down the road, but at the same time, I'd love to look into one that has illustrations, or is simply a really nice hardback version. 

Thanks for any thoughts!  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I asked this a while back when I was managing to keep up something like 12 to 15 reads, if not more. I was blowing cash, because if I can be honest, I had it to spend. However, I wasn't reading a lot of them because I truly loved them. I read them because I saw potential, and other people were praising them, and because of that, I found myself burnt out, and haven't read since mid October.

Today I plan on narrowing down my reading list to less than 10, but given that I'm about a month behind, I'd love to hear what you guys are still keeping up with so I  can get an idea for what is still great.

Then earlier today, I realized she was getting ready more than usual and said something like "I wonder who is working in ___ section today?". Just seemed kind of odd considering she doesn't really have a reason to go near said section, and along with her preparing herself more than normal.. I'm kind of wondering if my thoughts are way outta whack or if she's actually trying to impress another guy.

So, I'd love to hear any stories you guys have. I understand I may be thinking irrationally right now, but I'll still post, because I'm curious as to how others would feel about it, and it usually helps me realize that I'm being an idiot. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I've traveled before, but I've never been the head of the organizing. I was either the child, or the student, but I've never organized it myself.

I am now saving, and looking into a trip to Switzerland for 2. Yet I have absolutely no idea where to start. Do I search the web for a flights and hotel package? Just flights, and separate accommodation? Are there any types of sites I should ignore? Should I be going straight to the airlines website for prices instead of a hosting site? Or should I look into this through an actual booking agents, the old way?

Also, if any of you know anything about Switzerland, I'd love some advice on where to be looking. All I was told about it was that she wanted to snowboard too, which is a dream of mine, so that's a must have.

<TEXT> So I'm not from the Philippines, but I do have Filipino friends however, although they don't really talk about him often because they don't keep up with his 'antics' for lack of a term. Being on Reddit however, I see his name fairly often as of late, so..

For those in the country, and outside, how do you feel about him? Would you have voted for him, did you? 

Is his current situation with the US something you admire, removing them etc, or something you hate, and see him to be shaming the country by making such bold statements about the western power?

How do you feel about his drug stance, and current death count under his presidency? Do you feel he's doing right by those in the country, or that he should be taking the 'treat them first' approach? 

And before being afraid to comment, I'd genuinely appreciate how you feel on these matters, so those of you browsing past, please do not downvote others because they feel differently than you. </TEXT>

So, of course, in my head moving closer to both her, and the job, would simplify my life quite a bit. But, of course, working on close to minimum wage job, and looking to move closer to the city, I can't really pull it off alone.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm talking about trust issues, emotional problems etc. 

I ask because I have an incredible problem with trust. I've been with my SO a while now, and we've been great, truly. We had a hiccup or two, but nothing to cause a real fight.

With that, I've noticed a few major times I am flawed. She got back talking to her ex a few weeks back, and I was real worried about it. Quite frankly childish. I've since gotten past it, and now I talk to him on occasion too if we're in the same vicinity. With that... I still get a drop in my stomach whenever they talk. I know in my heart she wouldn't go back, because she really has come across as someone wholly given to me. 

She also works in a bar, doing frequent night shifts, and although I know it's simply part of the job, I can't stand it when she tells me some of the guys flirt with her on the job. She says she doesn't flirt back, and I believe her.. Yet a voice somewhere in my head is telling me she may find someone who hits on her, and pulls it off, then instead of taking the 3am bus home, she just chills with him for a while. 

So yeah... I have problems, I genuinely see that. I've been trying to get past them, but I have no idea how. I can't talk to her about it. Nothing is more unattractive to a woman than a man thinking she'll leave him when she's simply doing her job, or talking to a friend. 

I'd truly appreciate any help on the matter. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll have a few days work for a company this week, and it being my first job, I'm not sure what I do with the dole situation. I'll be collecting on Monday, working on Tuesday. Do I tell them I'll have a week's work when I'm collecting, even though it may just be a week? I asked the guy if it was cash in hand or whatever, and he talked about it not being cash in hand, and he'll need my ppsn. So this seem's like it'll be a full time gig after this week, but he also told me he only knows of a few days this week, and it may be nothing afterwards. That'd mean telling them is pointless, right? Or  would it mean I'd get in some kinda trouble, for being paid for more than 20 hours while on welfare?

I'd love some help here, as I legit have no idea what to do here. Thanks!

<TITLE> The Hobbit movies made me appreciate the book more. (few questions inside too) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-05 14:05:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I grew up on the LOTR movies, and when I heard the Hobbit was being released, I loved it too. At the time of release, as bad as they were, I loved them. Maybe not the third one, but I enjoyed the first two, and quite frankly still enjoy the first one.

With that said, I'd never read any of the books, so I subbed to Audible and am currently 'reading' The Hobbit right now. This is amazing. I just wrapped up the first chapter,and as close to the opening of the movie it is... It's just a whole other level of awe for me. The dwarves are definitely tougher. Even Bilbo, as much as I loved Freeman's early Bilbo, I really appreciate how 'to the point' this one is. 

I'm done my walk for the day with my dog, but it has me wanting to just solo walk around the neighborhood so I can listen to it without being distracted. 

Just thought I'd share my thoughts for anyone who was like me, having seen the movies but never tried the source.

So questions. What makes the Took's so odd? The rumor of fairies seemed odd, but at the same time, there has to be a reason they're an odd bunch of hobbits.

Also, apart from Smaug, are there any dragons in the world, or when was the last? We know that the last one in the shire was thousands of years ago, but what about elsewhere?

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I feel trust issues are easily one of the biggest problems in a relationship, and showing them is one of those things you should never really do. 

With that, I can't help it. I'll be real. My dad left when I was a kid, came back into my life, and left again because he didn't find me worth his time. I've been cheated on twice and left for another guy once. I don't have the greatest track record when it comes to holding faith in people. 

Now, with my SO of 2 months, I'm finding myself getting irked by the dumbest of shit. Jokes she makes with friends that could have a flirt vibe to them, whenever her friends ask her to go out for a night of drinks I feel a hole in my stomach because I wonder if she'll get wasted and find herself on another guy, because after drinking with her once, I realized she turns into that fun loose chic that dances with everyone (and that was only a few drinks during the evening).

I.. I just don't know how to deal with this. I can't talk to her about it, because being real, she has given me no reason at all to feel like this, so if I ever said it, I can only imagine how she'd react, but with my past.. It's just a struggle, and I really can't come up with something to deal with this. 

I'd truly love any help you can give. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Help] What am I supposed to do when my dog ONLY eats her food while it's hot? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-26 14:40:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I feed my dog kibble, but when she was younger, i poured hot water in it, and let it cool, to soften it up because she was a pup and someone suggested it. 

However, she's just gone 1 and I've realized lately, after about an hour of the food being down, it'd go cold, like expected, but the thing is, she will ignore that food until the next scheduled feeding would come, and she'd eat it when it's hot. 

How do I stop this? I'm wasting so much food because she is high maintenance with her eating. I've tried just leaving it there for her to eat it cold, but she just continues on and doesn't eat until I give up and feed her. 

Thanks for any help! </TEXT>

I've been hearing about her parents for since the beginning (we're both 20, so she still lives with them and occasionally they show up in the background if we talk). I imagine if we met, I'd get along great with both of them for different reasons. 

But she isn't in any real rush to introduce us. Of course I can see why, but at the same time, it's inevitable, right?

<TITLE> Have you dropped any titles from Rebirth yet? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-27 13:40:37 </DATE>

<TEXT> I understand of course we haven't seen all the titles, but we've seen most. [This is the current list] (https://i.gyazo.com/fee97e2f087c16532d6bdc0ba90f9420.png).

Honestly, it's painfully expensive, but the only one I see myself dropping any time soon is Batgirl and the Birds of Prey. I don't know what it is, but I simply haven't clicked with this. I see the humor in some of the lines, but I feel it's not really aimed towards me. (+Something seems off about the artwork, and I can't put my finger on it.)

Besides that, even both GL runs have me curious to how they approach what they're dealing with. With the normal GL run, it seems a whole lot of the writing is caught up in how Baz/Cruz deal with eachother and how they're always conflicting. If they are forever conflicting, it'll mean no character progression. If they stop conflicting.. It'll be interesting to see if they go good cop/bad cop as on the universe. 

I feel I'm writing to much into my thoughts on each run, but it's been a while since I've posted here, so I have missed a lot of discussions, so forgive that. 

I'd love to hear your thoughts though, on both what you've dropped, why you've dropped it, or why you're holding on to a run.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So hear me out here. I've been reading for about a year, but there was maybe a 3 month break around Christmas, so I haven't actually read that much. 

With that, when starting, almost all of my reading was Snyder's Batman, and then suggested books, like Geoff's GL omnibus, Superman Unchained, and then the general great stories. So reading all of those, I knew going in that I was getting a great read.

Now though, I'm reading the Rebirth releases before hearing the thoughts of others, and because of it, I'll be honest. I haven't been let down by anything yet, and feel it's all pretty solid writing.  Of course there were stand outs, which in my mind, were TEC, Superman: Rebirth, and GA. The rest were solid, but I expected it from King and Rucka, so there's that.

But I'm afraid I won't be able to spot bad writing, considering I don't think I've actually read any poorly reviewed work yet, and  when it shows up, I'm not sure if I'll spot it.

I understand this comes off kind of serious, but it was just a thought I found interesting, that I'd like to hear your guys' opinions on. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I've been playing on/off for about 2 years now, but never given it my all. Considering I'll be getting a competent pc soon, and Warcraft has me at a high for the series, I'd love to get back in. 

With that, I've tried logging on to my 100 hunter, and my 60 monk. Both of which are so lost for me. While I'm choosing a class, I have no idea where to look, because I've heard about the classic expansion updates coming to all classes, or most classes. 

What are some notes we should take into consideration when choosing a class a few weeks before Legion? 

For example, I love healing, I really do, but it seems a lot of healers that are strong, are required to do DPS to heal. I want someone that strictly focuses on putting out healing. The Pally heals by dps, right? The Monk heals a lot on his own, but I've heard real Monk players are meant to jungle dps stance and healing stance. So is there an update coming to healers that puts what I want into a character? 

Thanks!

EDIT: Also, I don't mind going Horde this time around, as Durotan is probably my favorite character in Warcraft lore now.  </TEXT>

However, I feel there are movies that make that setting part of the story and it's a much bigger part than it normally is. For example, there's a Joseph Gordon Levitt movie based on him being a delivery guy, and the city plays a huge part in that. It may not be a great movie, but I hope that explains what I'm looking for.

<TEXT> A  lot happened this episode, it really did. From Dany to Arya to Bran to Benjen to King's Landing.. But watching that Sam dinner scene again.. It's fucking incredible. 

I was distracted by the scene before it last night, wondering who it was under the hood, but watching it now.. They cast his father perfectly. He has the face of the man told in those stories. He has the tone of someone who truly wouldn't want a son like Sam. It was fucking incredible to watch that scene take place, to the point of me feeling awkward, even from an outside view, you could feel the tension when the camera moved to Sam, looking down at his plate.. 

I just thought I'd make this post, as I feel these scene is really well handled, but it slipped through the cracks because of the insane level of setup they had. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I just finished Geoff's GL Omnibus V1.. Oh my. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-28 00:10:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, going into GL, I didn't care for the character, as the only thing I knew about him was his smart ass comments in the JL run, and his movie.. So expectations were low to say the least. 

Now, I'm sitting here, reading the descriptions for each character, big or small. I can't describe how #25 made me feel. It was pure perfection. Having them fight the end out, without power? While also giving Cyborg Superman a fitting send off, which by the way, completely caught me off guard, and I felt fucking awful for it, which was made worse by his skull yet again floating around. 

But.. The whole reason I gave the run a chance, was because I read a comment once, about how emotional the scene was when the citizens started lighting up the city. I bawled. I cried for minutes with no progress due to the constant stream of tears. It is definitely my favorite moment from reading DC so far. 

I could go into it more, but it feels messy and rant-ish. Sadly though, I need to wait 2 weeks now before picking up v2 due to pay. I also understand you guys want me to try GLC, but it's just not on the cards right now, with how expensive the other 2 omnibus' will be, Rebirth, and my fresh copy of Kingdom Come waiting for me. 

Geoff. Thank you. You brought me into comics with JL V1, and now you've given me another incredible ride. Can't wait to continue it with V2 in the near future. </TEXT>

Grayson 2 got easier, and I'm adjusting to the non-superhero-esque run. 

3 though.. God damn. Well for starts, the "Dick!" page was way outta left field. After that though.. Those final 2-3 pages were upsetting. I found the villain cliche and super 70s with the "blind villain who is connected to revolvers that he looks through", but in the end.. Damnit. It was upsetting, and I'm I can't see why.

Then to make it worse, they killed the agent he was getting on with. Damnit King. If this level of writing is coming Batman... Oh let it be June already.

EDIT: And now, after being chased by some teenagers, he has been re-imaged as a french gymnast who happens to be gay, to stop the girls from following him. This is gold. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So we can all agree, when Jay showed up, we all had mixed thoughts. Some saw the potential for having a Flash duo running around, while in reality, he was a very, very dull character, with little to do and was very stiff acting wise. 

That has completely changed now though, in my opinion. He was stiff because he was actually playing a role. It's like seeing an actor play a bad actor in a movie. He hated being Jay, so because of it, he did as little as he could, while slugging through the shit. 

Now as he walks around, in what I can honestly say is probably the best looking costume on the show so far, he is really coming into his own. Everything from just talking to Barry in his lab, to that haunting look on his face before killing Papa Allen. 

Just thought I'd give my thoughts, and I'd appreciate if you shared what you think about him in general. Thanks! </TEXT>

Watching his streams do seem to help a lot too, because he's into explaining his builds for the champ he's playing. For example, he's against Essence Reaver on Lucian, because he feels the crit can be found somewhere else for cheaper, along with the damage, and make it a better deal in the long run. 

So what kind of general tips would you give for players like me, just looking to get outta here? Whether it be positioning, champ select notes, or quite frankly, I'm not sure what else could be said, but that is also why I feel I should be making this thread.

As someone who doesn't have much time in the game, I don't know what items I should be keeping, although I've marked Adhesive down for looting. That's about as far as I've gotten though. I didn't know my water pump set it to my junk collection until I read it on here. I also just found out empty water bottles can be filled up too. Along with the looting, what perks would be a must have? For example, I have idiot savant, and lone wanderer, but because I'm going for a base-centric playthrough, I now need to level up Int twice so I can unlock Science, so my next 3 levels are for one perk. I'd like a place where we can warn people about this, because it seems a lot, lot more important now, considering we can go from exploring the roads peacefully, to being hungry, thirsty, and in a gun fight, in an instant.

I'd just love a thread dedicated to survival tips, and moments people are having. 

Thoughts are of course welcome. (Tips even more so!) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Could someone recommend a stable build for survival? I have about 20 hours in game across multiple characters, and I've only reached diamond city once for a short time. 


This mode has me fascinated though, although I don't know where to start. A melee build is fucking crazy for what would essentially be a first run. Is a stealth build the way to go? Maybe some charisma mixed with strength. What perks should I focus on throughout the early game? The settlement will be hugely important for resources and whatnot. Should I get enough charisma to snatch up that store perk? 

 Thanks for any help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know it seems like a simple question, and going into the movie I thought it was just some marketing shtick to pick a side, but after talking with a large group of people about movie, I am genuinely amazed by how it made both of them the bad guy, simply by motives. 

I left the movie wondering how the writers got away with making Cap such a bad guy, but a few hours later in a call, one of my friends said that she stood behind Cap 100%, and was baffled as to how I saw Tony as a hero.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, and which side you took.

<TITLE> So after watching a few Dark Souls 3 gifs since release, what is the game actually like? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-01 21:02:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm looking for a game to keep my attention, without being an online game, as I feel I've had enough of that for now. 

I have been trying the Nioh demo, and it's opened my eyes to this genre. I tried demo souls back when I was a full on cod fan, only really playing cod with the occasional sport game. So I of course had noooo interest in a game that punished me as bad as it did. I tried Bloodborne too, and enjoyed it, but if broke after a few weeks.

So what is Ds3 like? When playing the older one, I knew the task was make it out alive, but I've never felt there is a story to the games even though I know lore is pretty huge among the following. 

I don't really know what to ask, because I'd imagine the combat is close to the same as the older versions, but more refined in terms of mechanics and bugs. How is the world? How are the classes? I've heard Knight is the easy run character to go. What are the others like? 

Is this game worth 70 dollars, in your opinion, when compared to other 70 dollar games.

Any thoughts in general would be very much appreciated. Thanks! </TEXT>

I have no love for the Souls series, as I got introduced to them way too early into my transition into challenging myself during games. Maybe I'll go back one day, but as of right now, this Nioh demo is quite frankly brilliant. It has the same kind of combat as Souls, and is on par with the level of punishment. It doesn't hold your hand either, although it does drop tutorial notes along the way. 

It's a Ninja/Samurai version of the Souls series. If that doesn't sell it, I don't know what will.  </TEXT>

Even with that, I really haven't seen anything about this game outside this sub. Is it simply because it's the classic game on our console, or is it genuinely a good game, with solid mechanics and whatnot? 

I understand it sounds harsh in the way I ask it, but after dropping 50 on a game that has been replaced by a demo.. Well I'm wary of where my cash goes. I know for sure that come the following week, I'll be pre-ordering Uncharted 4, but for now, I'm wondering about this game, because damn did childhood me love it.

If I play a different game, is my progress gone? 


If I summon my pet to the shrine, will I lose the cash I had on my corpse?


What are the numbers in the bottom? I get that the bottom left is cash, what is above that, and to the right. 


What does summoning a visitor do? 


Thanks for any answers!

Edit: so it seems going left at the second village (2 guys are farming on the left, and there's a guy in the house on the right) gives you a bow if you manage to make it alive. I'll work back to the building soon and update. This is a phenomenal game so far, if you're willing to take on a challenge and repeat your path a LOT.

Update: killed em all in 1 attempt. I can PM  you about how I went about it if you want, but the bow is incredible help.

Huh... So it now turns out what I expected to be the demo boss is actually a common enemy. Seems like I just found my first pre-order of 2016.

Would I be okay to install it once I wrap up this Kaer quest, or am I too far into the game for that to work well? I'll be doing ng+ on Death March so if I'm right, I'll be keeping my level and whatnot going through.

<TEXT> EDIT: Why do you support the team you support?* 

So I tried to get into the sport last season, but I joined in around mid June, so I was lost as all hell and had nothing to do outside watching the games (In Ireland). Now, with the release of the game, and I'd guess the season just started, so I'd be looking for a team to support. I don't know where to start though. 

So why do you support the team you support? I'd love to find a team to settle down with, and last year the suggestions were to watch a game, and feel out the teams but being honest, I really couldn't figure it out. 

Thanks!

EDIT 2: I also feel I should say this. I don't want to choose a team who are always on top. When I got into soccer in the early 2000s I was a Chelsea fan. When I got into the NFL, I was a Pats fan. Although neither of them are not exactly year by year winners, I feel they're easy to jump on to and be tagged as a bandwagon fan. I refuse to be that. I want a team people believe to be a great team, not in skill or winning, but to support. Although winning is nice. 

EDIT 3: I may also look into being a Dodgers fan. I loved watching those videos from the Dodgers guy a while back, but I heard he got taken down. (Just checked out his channel, turns out he's still active!) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I  knew she was dying as I went into this ep. I had to know when I woke up, and only finished the ep now. 

I am furious with the writers, I truly can't believe Guggenheim had the balls to kill off Oliver's better half, and one of her last lines were that she was not the love of his life, but rather the fanfic was.. Gah. 

But Katie Cassidy in this episode man.. SHE HAD SO MUCH FUCKING POTENTIAL. She was incredible in this episode. From deciding on the DA position, to talking to Oliver, to the final scene. If she were given actual writing, I'd honestly imagine there would be enough fans of her to get Guggenslime away from Tumblr. 

Hearing her say "one last time" though... It broke me. Along with the photo.. I was genuinely crying to the point of my lip wobbling like a child with no ice cream. Why did they have to bow down to Tumblr? This episode is real proof that Oliver should have been hers, as she was his, and it also shows that Felicity is an incredibly unnecessary character. Who also gave out the most bullshit gasp ever when Laurel was confirmed dead. Hiding her face because she couldn't pull together a real tear. 

I just don't know what to do. What was the secret? Did the container have some bullshit toxin in it, and she pulled a Roy? The writers aren't smart enough for that, are they? Was it simply the picture? (Heartbreaking too)

I'm so lost right now. Arrow is the reason I started reading comics. Props to Amell though. That shot of him leaving the room and looking truly lost in life.. Holy shit. Along with Lance dropping to the ground. A guy who has legitimately been fucked over throughout the show more than anyone. 

It's.. I don't want to let go but I have to. I'm genuinely heartbroken over a show, in a way I've never felt before due to a show. A real sense of loss, not for a character, but for an experience. A brand. A family. An adventure.

The writers are useless and disrespectul, and it genuinely gets me annoyed just thinking about how they came to that result.

<TEXT> Yes, I understand we have the sidebar, but I'm not looking for just one character. Most of my reading is Batman. I've read New52 JL, but anything pre-52 is a Batman read. 

However, I feel I've missed out on some of the epic reads. I haven't read Kingdom Come, but I'd imagine that is one. Then I'm thinking Flashpoint, because of course that story went big enough to reset time. Then I feel All Star Supes fits in there too. 

That is as far as my list reaches though. And I'd love some other opinions, because next week I'll be picking up the three stories I've mentioned above, to read most likely within the weekend, and I'd love some more suggestions on where to go next. Thanks!

EDIT: Here. As of right now, this is my [collection] (http://i.imgur.com/QA5akN1.jpg) The book just above GL is Superman Unchained.  I'm also only about 300 pages into the GL run. Hal just got back talking to the guys at the airbase if I recall it correctly.

<TITLE> What is the best series currently running? (In your opinion of course) </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I'm curious about trying Marvel. I tried a while back, but it was overwhelming, simply because I don't remember there being a starting point, in the way DC has New52. 

I really do want to get into the world though. I'm just unsure where to start.  I don't have a preference for characters because I'm honestly not sure if the characters in the movies are the same tone of those in the comics. 

With that said, instead of grabbing a random series and being turned off, I'd rather start off strong and work from there.

Thanks for any opinions! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Apparently Dardevil is spoiled this week, and it has me thinking about GoT now. I've also been watching TotalBiscuit's Secret Hitler series lately, and I feel what he does really manages to keep away spoilers. 

Just a simple overlay for when the topic is there, and drop it when it's not. It doesn't need to be some fullscreen banner, because that'd take away the faces and sponsors. I'm just looking for somethign in one of the blank areas, or under the sponsors.

<DATE> 2016-03-23 17:00:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Let's be real. The art is an equal to writing, when it comes to what makes a normal comic release, into an all time great.

With that said, I've been wondering lately, which story, could you remove the art, and make it a legit novel, while keeping the quality and storytelling up to par. 

I'm not sure if it's been done before, and I'd imagine it has. Of course it's no longer a comic, but I'd imagine someone, at some point in time, has tried to take one of our beloved heroes, and took a swing at a story without the art or the speech bubbles. 

So, I'll ask for both, stories that have already been done, and stories that you feel could pull it off.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just made a post about armor, but quickly deleted it because I realized something. 

So I played a while back, got to Skellige, lost my data. Had to start again, fell out of love due to how into that run I was. Now I'm back, and trying on Death March. Although it's a struggle, I feel it can be handled well, but still, it takes me a full 2-3 minutes to take out a pack of wolves, and that's if I time everything perfectly, and due to it being such a challenge, I feel I need to right mindset before playing. So I ask you guys. 

Should I continue on Death March? Should I drop down one, or even two difficulties on a first time run, and come back to DM when I've finished the game at least once?

Thoughts are welcome. Thanks!

EDIT: So after a bit of googling, it seems it gets easier. With that said, I'd love some tips for how to go about it. Do i hoard everything? Do I sell everything etc. What type of armor. Character upgrades. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

I understand we may have the same normal level, but the gap was very, very noticeable, and when trying to kill a rogue, it was close to impossible. 

Should I just wait until 30 now? I'd guess I'm too late to start in the dz, and should come back when geared up, but I also feel a bit lost on why that is happening. Thanks!

So yeah, that's just it.

My point: Flights are expensive as fuck when it comes to flying outside Europe, and I'd be willing to wear some clothes to deal with that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 21 minutes in, and I've probably heard 4 soundbites so far, and honestly, they're not very good, but at the same time, this is of course the first time. 

With that, I feel it is pointless if the guys can't hear it. If, after every soundbite, all we hear is a chuckle from Woody due to him believing it's well timed or a zinger, and all the while, Kyle and Taylor continue the talk. 

With that, I of course haven't reached the end of the show yet, although while writing this, I've heard two poorly timed Wings bites, that straight up clashed with Taylor's talking. 

Hopefully something can come from this, although if I recall it correctly, didn't we have soundboard talk within the last 15 eps or so, and how it didn't work very well, and every 1 in 10 was actually funny? 

I'd love your thoughts.

EDIT: Chiz is now adding to the show. I'm all for this idea of a background guy googling and researching, but he needs to cut off earlier. He's getting carried away in this steak thing and throwing out his opinion. Sounds kinda harsh, but just a thought. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Extremely simple questions in regards to cooking chicken fillets, and rice. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-10 22:13:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So some time in the next few weeks, I am going to put my fitness act in play. I'll be eating chicken, rice, and depending on the day, something like carrots, broccoli, baked potatoes, etc. 

With that said, I rarely, if ever, cook the food I eat. So here are my questions. 

How long do I boil the chicken for, and I do boil it right? Just a sauce pan full of water, still the chicken in, and boil, right? 

Then, the same for the rice, right? 

Once both are done, how long can I store it for? If I were to use clingfilm, could I store say, 10 chicken fillets, for a week, or would I have to cook 2 a day, and keep on top of it? The same applies for rice. 

If I can store both, I'd be fine microwaving them back to edible temperature, right? 

I understand these questions may truly be below a lot of you, considering this is a cooking sub, and I have never cooked, but I can honestly say I appreciate the art, and would love some help on getting started. Thanks!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, a big part of Tolkien's memory, would be, in my opinion, that he set the ground work for what a true fantasy piece is, by simply writing a battle of true good vs evil. 

With that though, I wonder now, with all of the history he wrote, when does evil actually win? 

Don't quote me on it, because I'm foggy on the events that lead up to it, but would we consider Fingolfin's suicide by combat a loss in the good vs evil fight? I'm not sure how he came to be the last of his kind, and of course he never stood a chance against Morgoth, but I feel it does seem like a genuine loss in some way. 

Are there any others? There has to be, right? 

I'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions on the matter. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> As usual, I've been watching clips from the movies, and I've seen how incredibly talented Jackson made the elves. How the men of Rohan shot arrows, but they were all kind of bogey shots, and wobbly when holding the bows, yet when it came to the elves, nothing would faze them. They stared down the army, and they even had the accuracy to shoot from behind the wall, through the gaps in each soldier. 

To me, at least, this really does seem like the biggest example of elven warriors being some of the best in Middle Earth. That being said, of course it's now a cliche that elves are the best archers in any selected universe.

That being said, a lot of them are 30 for 30 situations, which I'm guessing is kind of a documentary styled movie? There's also a lot of god awful stuff like "Dad's a soccer mom". There also seem to be a lot of super cliche fighting movies.

I'd just love some input. Are the 30 for 30 movies worth watching, no matter the subject? I don't have a love for a sport, nor a hate for one, just an interest in a movie. 

Thanks!

<DATE> 2016-02-29 01:13:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Now, before we start, this is not hate, I feel it's genuine criticism. 

In this weeks PKA, the first 40 minutes or so of the show was all political talk, and then about 30 minutes after that they worked back around to it somehow. 

Now I'll admit I don't mind it that much, but I feel for that amount of time to be taken from a show we only get once a week, seems a bit much. Especially for those of us outside the US. 

Along with that, I feel it's easily said that shows that have a heavy amount of current-events talk, tend to age poorly. An odd example, but something I noticed nonetheless. In PKA 145, we hear that Ben Affleck is announced as Batman. And with that, is a barrage of hate for the casting choice, and it's said that he has no chops, how we need a stronger Batman, and it won't work. Now.. Well I'd imagine opinions have changed on that.

Although that is more around opinions, I feel that because it was so long ago, and things have changed, the hate for the casting choice has faded away, that whole topic didn't do very well. 

I get the same thing with bootcamp talk, considering the outcome we saw, and the current Wings we know. 

So yeah, I'm not asking for it to be wiped out, because of course that's not going to happen with the year we have ahead of ourselves, I just thought I'd give my thoughts before heading to bed. I'd just like to see PKA age better than I expect it to when it comes to this time-frame. (the presidential race)  </TEXT>

<TITLE> How good, or bad, is Chicken and Rice when it comes to replacing your daily meals? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'll be honest, I don't know if this can be a breakfest and dinner type scenario, or if there is more to it. I've tried looking at the getting started section, but it's incredibly overwhelming for someone who doesn't really keep up with weight, what is in his food, his daily intake etc.

That being said, I've seen it mentioned a few times among groups I talk to, that a person or two is only eating chicken and rice for whatever amount of time.

Is this a good idea? A bad idea? Of course it's boring, but I feel it may also take a whole lot of bad stuff away from your day to day eating, along with the chicken bringing in protein.

Like I said, this is the first time in my life that I'm paying attention to my weight, the ingredients in my food, and just general healthiness, so tips would be great. Thanks.

EDIT: Also, I'm guessing it's one of the cheapest diets out there, considering you can pick up 6-8 fillets for like 5 euro in some butchers. 

EDIT 2: Would it make sense to add some kind of powdered shake into the mix for gain? I understand what I'm looking for here is weight loss, but it's more about dropping the wasteful weight, and turning what I had into muscle.  </TEXT>

But lets be real. You remove the opening walk scene, the yet again crying Felicity, the search description scene, and then the final scene. You know what you have? An action packed, emotional episode. 

I understand the writers pander to Tumblr, and I would leave the show, but I care too much for this character. Please. Writers, if you ever read this. Fuck Tumblr. You are absolutely destroying what could be an amazing, action packed show, simply to please a few fan fictions spammers on a website that is known for shipping characters. 

Please. I really don't want to give up this show, but you're making it so fucking hard. I'm in tears here because I know it's coming. I know Felicity is still close to Oliver come to funeral scene. I saw the tweet or whatever it was of them in the wedding. I'm not sure what it meant, but dear god if it's a shot from a future episode I'll be done. 

You may not care about your characters, but please care about the fans that do.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll be honest, I watched 3 minutes of it and left. It seems he's taking the good old "I'll speak loudly to be perceived as correct" strategy. 

That being said, I also feel that nothing positive can come from this for you. If you "win" this drama, you gain nothing. If you "lose" this drama, we of course know Keem is already working up a vid and whatever else. 

Along with that, and this is honestly just me speaking, but I'm done with drama. I watch you for you. You're a 40+ year old dad. I don't watch you to get caught up in something like this. I can.. And naive as it may come off, say that I feel you're better than this. 

So if there is a video or Reddit/twitter post coming, don't?

EDIT: So I'm listening to his video now on like 10% volume... Did he just pimp a coupon code mid "fuck you" rant?

EDIT 2: Restraining order.. Huh. 

EDIT 3: Just a few notes. That fucking shock collar thing was a scummy thing to say. He shouted quite a lot that he's done with Woody, while making a video about Woody. That payment idea he has for Wings on PKA is fucking idiotic. And there is the threat for following up on the recording..

That was interesting. That being said, we now have both sides. Leave it there please.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to say the beta is over, because if I recall it ended on Sunday, but I wasn't sure on the time and I'm work now. 

With that... I went in very, very wary because it was of course a Ubisoft beta. And because of that, I can honestly say I was blown away.

I loved the beta, I really did. I'm considering now if I should grab a physical copy at 9am on the 8th, or just go digital so I can go big at midnight on the 7th. 

If you enjoyed Destiny, and love the city feeling this game sets, you should definitely look into buying this game.

Back to my point though. How good is the mapping? Is the post office actually across from MSG or is that just for convenience? If I'm walking down 34th in Division, would I see the same buildings along 34th?

<TEXT> I have done my very bets to defend this show for most of it. I wasn't on this sub when I watched the first 2 seasons or so, and I rarely, rarely came here before mid season 4, but when I have, I've done my best to defend that which is Olicity. I was just a big fan of the actress at the time, and Laurel was very much drunk/mopey/angry Laurel so I never saw her with Ollie.

That being said.. Why the fuck do we have scenes now that are dedicated to the relationship of Lance/felicity's mom? What the fuck is this show turning into?

I understand Tumblr has a foothold in the show's working for some reason, but dear fucking christ is it ruining this show. 

I've never been one to post about how angry or annoyed I am at an episode, but this episode was a joke. 

I'll give the positives of it. The fight scene in the courthouse (if that was where the debate was held) was badass. Diggle deflecting the swing? Yes please. Diggle finishing the guy off? Yes please. Thea swinging from the chain, only to save Laurel? Yes.  Thea's line about learning the fire alarm trick in school? I chuckled. The Oliver line about bringing the house down was pretty funny. Then the finale. Darhk straight up killed Samantha. I understand something would come of it due to Malcolm, and the screen time with Thea. But dear god, he just took the child. 

That is some drama I can appreciate. The Green Arrow has a son, and now he is in danger that no kid should ever be in. I don't want to hear about how Felicity's mom has met liars before, when Darhk is kidnapping children at the same time. 

Sorry if this came off a bit ranty, and I understand I've probably said nothing new, but I had to vent.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I'll be honest, I'm new to this sub. I only started the show like 4 days ago but I'm caught up. With that, I just found out it's based on a book. And that book is a trilogy. 

So is the show just based upon the characters, with a vastly different story? Does the show take place at the same time as the books, but events unfold differently? Are the characters the same for the most part? Is it one book to one season?

<TEXT> Two questions I have.

1) Why are the Lanterns forbidden from the Vega zone? I understand it is part of a pact made long ago, but do we know why?

2) What is the extent of the color yellow's power? I understand that Sinestro is Yellow for fear, along with Parallax, but I felt at the start of my read (Currently about 250 pages into Geoff's Omnibus), that it was just a thing for art. Green bounces of yellow, in the way blue does off red, and black does off white... But now OA is under attack by these Spiders, and they have to retreat with a lot of the new trainees because they are straight up weak against the spiders because they are golden in color. Is it strictly to do with "Yellow=Fear", and once they overcome so called parallax equation, the actual color isn't a problem anymore?

Thanks for any help! </TEXT>

Superman. Action Comics. Batman/Superman. Superman/Wonder Woman. Lois and Clark. American Alien.. It's quite a list, so if you could point me towards the best run, or even the best timeframe of a certain run (as people tend to do for GA, which is around Volume 4), I'd really appreciate it.

<TEXT> So I understand that he is an alternate universe version of Logan, who is old, duh..

But the world he just got thrown into is the basic Marvel world, in which the avengers are superheros and beloved by all, right? So, having come from the world where the hulk gang, which I'm guessing is run by a super villain version of Hulk, Logan is going to find the good guy Hulk and believe him to be a villain, right? He simply feels he's a few years in the past of his world, and the actual one he is in right now is a different past than his, right?

That is the main problem I'm having, but I also understand a big event just happened, so something could have taken place in that event that actually leads Hulk to be a villain, I don't know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll be the first the first to say it. I hate what they have been doing in terms of baiting her death, only for her to go full Oracle on us... But damn when they actually mentioned her. What was it? "I was going with Oracle but it's taken".. God damnit, I can get behind that.

The fact that they know she's basically Arrow's Oracle at this point is amazing to me. It's even better because, well, THEY MENTIONED BATMAN. I remember a few weeks back we got the "I've seen Men of steel break, and Dark knights fall" or whatever it was, and damn did it feel good.

But with the mention of Oracle, it shows so much.. The existence of Batman. The fact that Barbara isn't Batgirl, and has already become the Oracle we know from post-killing joke..

I'm sure I've thought about this more than I should, but being the Batman fan I am, I thought I'd share my thoughts here. And with that, I'd like to hear yours!

Guys,, I thought I'd add this in.

So I've been looking for Superman Earth One Volume 2-3. 3/4 comic stores about 50 minutes away have replied saying they don't have it, the 4th is yet to reply.

So instead of letting myself get annoyed at missing out, I have a better idea. I'm going to shop for writers this week. All I really know so far is Snyder's Batman. Snyder's Superman Unchained. Then whoever wrote Trinity War (forgive me).

So the two names I hear most often are Geoff Johns, and Grant Morrison. Would I be doing it right by buying any 'big title' they have? As in, not a volume 4 of a run, but something like Batman RIP. It can be read without previous reading and whatnot.

Any other names would be great, or even artists, because i have the same tunnel vision for Capullo (which.. Isn't too bad IMO, but it feels wrong to only know one artists style).

Heck, even massive titles would be great. I am nearly caught up on Batman, but after reading Unchained a few nights ago (in one sitting..), I can't help but feel I'm missing out on something. Jim Lee is his name, right? Are there any titles you guys would suggest that is packed with his work? 

Once again, thanks for any help you give, I really appreciate it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I've been refreshing the YT page since Saturday night because of a theory I heard, and it hasn't been any use so far.. Then I was checking the Facebook page.

We have the Stark teaser on the 23rd. The Targaryen on the 24th. The Lannister on the 25th..

And seeing as last year, we got those raven visions to hype us up before, can we assume that..

THE TRAILER IS TOMORROW?!? If you are like me, and have a lot of spare time, I'd check the GOT Facebook page, between 3-7pm on the 26th. Two of the house teasers were released around 5pm, while the Lannister one dropped 3:30 today, which was the earliest of the lot.

Good luck hunting guys.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'll admit it took me maybe a month and a half to go from buying V4-V7, and starting to read them. I found the art style odd quite a lot, and I love Capullo's work. But now on to it.

So I just got done with Dark City, after starting it yesterday. It was... Quite a ride. It really was. Especially the flashback scenes. 

The final battle was awesome too, and how he just stopped caring about the bots. Then, even though I knew nothing would happen to the city any further, I was still panicking as I read about the jets flying in. The bat-signal was also touching.

I'll just give these two points and then end the post because I'm not very good at reviewing or sharing my thoughts.

That 2-3 page spread of Bruce settling down with Julie.. I legit closed the book after realizing it was Alfred's dream, and just sobbed for a few minutes. Snyder why?!? Along with quite a lot of other pages in the arc, this really hit me hard with the fact that Bruce, will never truly be free of the Bat, and as much as it destroys him, it is the only way he'll be happy. 

Then, we have the pages that are after "the end". I only know of Harper from Volume 1 of Eternal, but after reading this, I realized I'm going to buy V2-V3 when I get the chance because I really like her character. That being said, I found everything post- her dad shutting the door, to be a wave of emotions coming towards me. The shot of Batman with all the other heroes around the page. Her then fixing the light, while giving the speech about believing in those that we cannot see. 

Dear god, that was just an incredible experience, and I was considering skipping it not so long ago, until I chatted with a few of you on here and got convinced to read it. 

So thank you guys. I really appreciate you as a community, and more so, thank you Snyder/Capullo.. What a ride you guys sent me/us on.

EDIT: Also, [this] (https://i.gyazo.com/75336f3b792db1608766df82b0b6561f.png) look by Alfred.. I'm done. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's just a thought I'm having. Isn't the reason PKA Plays stopped being a thing, was due to Woody and his work schedule. How he could some nights be up for most of the night, only to be up early the next morning for the same thing.

So it seems this has changed, right? Maybe he picked up more staff or something, but if he has time for travelling to S Carolina, and to Spain for some 'jetpacking' in the water, is it crazy to ask for a few hours whenever to get PKA Zombies out? More Mount your friends, etc. 

Of course it can't just be a 'lets do it today' type deal, but seeing that they guys are up for something like this, and the fact that Taylor/Kyle/Chiz tend to play BO3 a lot, I feel like we could reasonably ask for PKA plays.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm looking to start picking up random comics and reading, instead of sticking to Batman, and only Batman. 

Today I was looking, and one two that stood out, were of course the Blackest Night, and Brightest Day set.(I went with Superman: Earth One, in the end). It may be because I was reading Omega Men last night and Rayner says it in that, or it could be because of how highly it's praised on here, I'm really not sure. 

So that's what I'm here to ask. I looked in the recommended section and it's not on the GL list, but it does seem interesting, because it both holds the GL oath, and it has undead. 

If you could share your thoughts on the set, I'd very much appreciate it. Thanks! </TEXT>

But looking on Amazon, it says pre-order for the 2nd of Feb. While the release date says 19th of Jan.. So is this an actual cinema release in the US? I don't mean to sound so shocked, it just doesn't seem like a thing that happens. 

I've also heard people praise it, so it's clear it's somewhere.. And being the investigative type I am, it may be on less-than-legal sites.(which confuses me due to the lack of sites I can find a purchase on)

<TITLE> Is it okay to skip Snyder's Zero Year? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-18 13:32:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'll be honest. I bought volumes 4-7 back in early December. And.. I really haven't got the love for reading it like I had with Death of the Family, or any of the first 20 issues in general. Heck, even the later parts of Batman Eternal really had me on the edge and flying trough it, although not loved by all. 

So then I got to Zero Year, and I kind of have an idea about hsi origins, but I also understand that Frank Miller's is the one and true definite version of his origins, so Snyder tried to give his own take on it I guess? 

So seeing as I'd like to get around to Miller's version in the coming weeks, along with reading TDKR, I'm just looking to ask you guys. Can I skip volume 4-5 and go to Graveyard shift and Endgame?

Or should I grind through the two issues of Zero Year? 

Thanks for any help you give!

EDIT: Also, I know at some point, I'm guessing after Zero Year, it says that the events that follow are taking place after Eternal. Should I grab Eternal Volume two before continuing the normal run? I enjoy it, but it's also 40 euro.. So yeah. Kind of expensive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been putting this movie off for some time now, but I finally decided to watch it today, and I won't get into how I feel about it, because I still have a disgusting feel in my stomach. ESPECIALLY after seeing that my city was on the list at the end.

But on to my point, this cast was great, it really was. But Mark Ruffalo.. Wow did he stand out. For the first half of the movie, I found his performance very refreshing. Something about character really set him apart from his other characters, although I haven't seen much of his work.

Then when he wants to publish it and get's told no.. That shouting was some of the best shooting I've seen on screen in a while. Just the passion. The belief what he was saying. You could tell he himself was truly fucking horrified of what has been happening, and he channeled it into his character perfectly. 

I also just looked up the Oscars, and he's a supporting role in this movie? I understand we had Michael Keaton playing the head of the office, but I really feel Ruffalo was the lead in this. That being said, I just hope he gets the recognition he deserves for this role. 

Phenomenal. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Being new to Marvel, should I read just the 7 issues of Civil War, or the entire series? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-12 10:06:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So back when I started reading DC, I read absolutely everything when it came to a crossover or tie-in, and due to doing that, I didn't enjoy certain stories as much because I didn't like the characters, or the store for said characters.

But now I'm looking at Marvel. And seeing as this is an older arc, I'm sure some of you guys know what's good and bad, but here's my thought. 

Should I read just the main 1-7 CIVIL WAR issues, or should I start off before Civil War, with Spiderman, Fantastic Four, and New Avengers, Illuminati.

Instead of listing the reading list I found, I'll leave this here. [List] (Ihttp://www.howtolovecomics.com/2014/11/30/marvel-civil-war-reading-order-guide/)

So if you guys have any experience in reading this I'd appreciate it. I'll most likely start off by reading at least one issue of different titles, and if I don't enjoy it, I guess I'll leave it. 

Although, if there are standout issues or titles I should keep up with for this, I'd love to know. Thanks! 

EDIT: So.... Looking into it further, apparently there are 107 issues? I'm not saying that's insane, but I also feel not every one of those are necessary. That being said, I'll start off by trying them all, any input is welcome.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is Jennifer Lawrence cursed with being too big a star? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-11 16:12:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is just a thought I had watching the Golden Globes but hear me out. 

So when you watch a movie, the goal is to care about, or hate the characters, right? To get into the world, and forget your one. The whole point of entertainment really. 

But here we have Jennifer Lawrence. And actress who went from an unknown, to one of the biggest names on the planet.

But.. When I hear her name at this point, I'm no longer excited. I may be alone in this thought, but when I hear she's in a movie, I don't expect to be blown away, or even grabbed by her character. For example, Joy. I watched this trailer a few times to grasp what the movie is about (and I still don't get it), but while doing so.. I realized I'm now just seeing Lawrence on screen. I'm not seeing her character. I have the same feeling for x-men. You hear her talk about 'this is war' in Apocalypse, but something just doesn't feel right. And I feel it's due to her sweeping the world around the time of Hunger Games. 

Of course stars hit it big all the time, or they stay relevant across a period of time (which she is doing too, of course).. 

For example, Leo DiCaprio. He is one of the best actors on the planet, and we all know it, right? You hear he's in a movie, you watch it, or least most of the time. He is a star on the same level, if not bigger than Lawrence (for you to decide I guess), yet, watching him, I see his character. I don't see him. I'll be going to the see Revenant next week, and I really doubt I'll see Jordan Belfort trekking across the woods. 

So I'd like to hear how guys feel about this. Do you feel I'm just looking at it wrong, or if she is too big for his shoes. Even writing this, I may be burned alive, but I feel.. For the star level that she's at, I don't think her acting is keeping up with her. Of course there are different examples to prove me wrong on that, but I can't put a finger on the problem I'm talking about here, so if you guys have input, I'd love to hear it.

Thanks!  </TEXT>

But, seeing the kind of library they have, I have a feeling I'm going to be overwhelmed straight out of the gate.

I'd love to have him on again some day, and feel he is a great friend for the show to have. It may not be the same the second time he appears, due to us knowing his take on it all now, but I also feel it would be nice to see him come back on again just as a friend of the show, and we skip past the interviewing section, straight to the typical PKA banter we usually get.

<TEXT> I know I post here quite a bit regarding the books, but I also have to discuss what I read..

So Geralt of Rivia, the Butcher of Blaviken. I always guessed he got that name for slaughtering a shit ton of people, as you'd expect with Butcher, but oh my.. You would expect when he wins that you'd be happy for him. That you would feel relief. But you don't, do you? You feel, or at least I do, genuinely sorry for Geralt because of what he had to do. 

You know he's a monster hunter for hire, and he tries to stay out of man on man affairs, like he did this time, but for someone that believes all evil is evil, and he deals with evil.. You can really feel his struggle this time due his belief that she wasn't a monster like the rest he kills. The best part of the 100 pages I've read so far is definitely the last few paragraphs after that fight. (and also the attic scene before hand)

So those of you that read it, I'd love to hear your thoughts, because I, being new to this world, could be very wrong about how I imagine Geralt feels in certain moment, so some outside opinions would be nice. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I was playing back when TTK dropped, but a few weeks after release, I saw the chance to pick up a PS4 for way cheaper than normal, but having been on xbox 360 before hand, nothing I achieved carried over, so after trying to level for a few days, it felt like death. Having nobody to play with, having no gear, none of my achievements.. Basically all that is Destiny, and I had none of it. 

So back to my point. How is the game now? I saw they added in some kind of in game currency you can buy, and now you can buy character levels. Is there more to it? Has the silver ruined the game or helped it? 

How is the game lasting due to TTK being the only release for this year? (instead of how year one had content split up)

Overall, I'd appreciate some keynotes on the game's state right now, and where you see it going. Thanks! </TEXT>

No matter what I'm reading, or where I am, I'll be making sure I read for at least an hour a day, for the year or further.

Of course for some people an hour may be a bit, so start off at 30 minutes a day? Even just find the book you want a do a chapter a day if you can.

<TEXT> So I'm coming back to Witcher after a few months away, but I have to start my game again due to loss of save, which I don't mind. 

So going into it this time, I want to know all there is of the world pre-W3. I've read up on Yen, Triss, Dandelion, a few other characters, and state of the world. Along with the first 2 game's plot. 

But when it comes to the armies, I'm struggling here. 

Apparently the north are free folk, but in saying that, they are also heavily racist, inbred, and siding with them could result in a whole lot of war among states, but the game is also seen from a Northern perspective. 

Then the Nilfgaards come along to conquer it all, and you have a past with their leader. They are wealthy, resourceful, and they have pure peace in their section of the world. But then they are also brutally strict and allow slavery. 

So can someone help me clear it up and a bit and give me some more perspective? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been playing for about 3 hours, and remembered how incredible it feels, and that it may just be the closest we ever get to a Game of Thrones game, in terms of sex/violence/plot/ world style. 

Just a thought, but if someone with a Twitter could recommend this to him, or even if Woody/Taylor see it. 

The game is phenomenal, and knowing that he sinks hours at a time into the game he is playing, I'd be curious to see what he thinks.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So here's the deal. I had the game a while back, but it broke. Then I got it about a week ago, but due to the holidays and everything, I only got to pick it back up today. 

So when I had it, I believe the last part of the main quest, if it even was that, was when I was with Yen in Skellige and I told her I loved her. That not be the main quest, but that's all I can remember from that late in the game. 

I don't mind having to restart though, there are choices I made that I'd like to take back this time around. And in saying that, I've heard there are something like 36 endings, right? When it comes to other choices in the game, lets say something like the Baron's fate, how many outcomes are there? 1-2? 3+? 

I'd love some help on the matter, but I only put the spoiler tag up for the moments I give away. I'd rather not learn the other fates of the Baron, just a number on how many ways it could go, if we even know. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> (I thought I'd add this in, I'm only returning now, after a break since the heist release) 

So I love to race in GTA. It's probably my favorite part of the game aside from the first time heists I did when they released. 

I've also ran that highway race maybe 150 times too many. So when I look to get the custom built races, I'm not really sure how to go about it. 

I know you do it on the Rockstar website, but when I looked to add races way back when, it was always such a hassle of having to add the race, then load the new option, then add the race, and so on, and so on. 

Is this the only way to go about it, or can I just kind of mass-add the a set of races? I'm not sure if I can add playlists in general in, but if I can I'd appreciate being told how. 

Any help regarding this matter in general would be great. Thanks! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm just thinking about something I read in Batman Eternal a few weeks ago. 

There is a point in it when Batgirl, Batwoman, and Red Hood, are all together in Brazil or something like it. They are both hunting the same guy, and decide to teamup, but at one point, Batwoman says she's not part of the family dynamic, and to my knowledge, this is the first I've seen of her in 24 issues of Batman and a few early tie-ins to Death of the Family. 

So why did she choose that name? Also, upon googling, it says Batman is her significant other. Is that simply because of the Batman-Batwoman name, or is there some kind of connection that has been left of Batman? It seems odd, but I'll ask just to be sure. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

But I can't for the life of me figure out where the fuck I'm meant to go. I'd be going one way, then find a ledge I can drop down from, which brings me to a gate I can't open, that puts me up against a monster I can't fight yet, only to see me returning to the lantern at the start of the game. 

Right now I'm down fighting what seem to be were-people and birds. There's also a pit of pretty large zombie like creatures further down. Am I going the right way?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Do you guys have any tips for reading Tolkien? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-21 21:18:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'll be honest. I'm yet to read LOTR. The only way I could do the Hobbit was by audiobook (partly because I picked it up between the movie releases, so I struggled a bit more because I thought I knew what had already happened, which was of course wrong).

But I've tried to read LOTR a few times throughout my life. I've been a die hard fan of the movies since release, and find myself watching them in the background in the same way someone would listen to the radio in a car. 

Yet I can't read the books.. I absolutely love Tolkien too. I know of Eru, I know of Bombadil, I know of Fingolfin and Feanor. Yet whenever I try to read LOTR, I always get distracted and find myself doing something else instead of continuing to read. 

So is there something I can do to remedy this? If you guys have any help I'd really appreciate it, because as you can probably see, I really do want to read it but I need help regarding how I go about reading it or the setting in which I try to read it.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'll be honest here. I'm looking for a new build, because the generic one I've been trying just isn't working for me, and because of it, I really don't play the game as much as I should. 

Right now I'm doing the somewhat stealthy rifle tactic, then when I'm caught I go guns blazing with a pistol or shotgun. My highest 'trait' (if you'd call it that) is that I can lockpick master locks (or the one bellow it). 

So with that, I'd really appreciate some setups or guides that could make the game more interesting. Whether it be a public speaking type deal, an idiot that is max luck, a full stealth melee character (which I've heard is great but I don't see how it works in a few cases). 

So yeah, any suggestions would be great. Thanks!

<TITLE> So how does the world feel about Scott Snyder? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-06 21:35:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So as someone who has only been reading for 4-5 months, keeping up with all the writers and artists, who at points I guess are called pencillers? 

But so far, here's what I know. 

Geoff Johns is pretty liked, but I forget why. I'm a fan of Justice League, although I've heard people aren't a fan of his WW, and how he shits on Batman a lot in the early issues. 

Grant Morrison is loved for his GL run, and I guess loved in general? 

Frank Miller.. Wrote one of the greatest Batman stories of all time, but he's so off the deep end at this point that the world just accept's the fact he's a crazy supremacist.

But I came to a realization today. My favorite writer, is accidentally Scott Snyder, because I have Superman Unchained, the Vol 1-7 of Batman. And I love it. (Although I'm only starting 4 now, after finishing vol 1 of Eternal).

So how do you guys feel about him? While you're at it, if I got any of the majority opinions wrong, or you have a differing opinion, I'd love to hear it, because I feel I should start learning more about the writers I like/dislike, the artists I should look out for/ avoid, etc. 

Also, the only artist I know is Greg Capullo, for his Batman. Although Eternal seemed to have a whole lot of varying artists, so that was an interesting read. Even some of the covers were 3d, which felt weird, but in a good way.

So yeah, I'd love to hear your opinion if you feel like sharing!

EDIT: So Geoff Johns is the guy who wrote the GL run, and not Morrison. My bad! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not because the posts will be spoilers in there titles, although there will be the few that don't understand their wrong doing.

But more of the fact that there are people out there, who will make accounts, just to pm other users that browse certain subs, and spoil the thing they loved enough to be on that sub for. 

For example, two days after the release of Fallout, I was maybe 15 hours in, and bang. I opened my inbox to see what people had to say to me, and it was just sitting there. In all caps, for maybe 15 lines, the ending to Fallout 4. 

So that's it really. Be very, very careful come 1-2 days before release, on what you post/say. It may just get the movie ruined for you.

<TEXT> I asked for some suggestions a few days ago, and somehow came up with Superman: Earth one. 

But that wasn't in stock. Well the first volume was, and so was the third, but I didn't pick them up because.. Well. I got sucked in. I bought the hardcover version of Superman Unchained. 

I honestly know nothing about this story other than it's Superman. Did I just buy the whole thing as a hardcover? Is there another hardcover I should pick up after this? 

It was a legit blind purchase, but the hardback/art style combo.... I'm not that great with money. 

So if anyone could help me with this matter, I'd appreciate it. Thanks! (If you could also give me a rating out of 10 on it, I'd appreciate that too)

Batman 1-20

The Killing Joke

Justice League 1-34

Nightwing 1-8

Injustice 1-13 (or so)

Grayson 1-3

Supergirl 1-2

Green Lantern Rebirth (I just don't have the time or money to get through that entire read, no matter how incredible it is)

I've also watched All Star, Under the Red Hood, and some Young Justice. Oh, and The Dark Knight of course.

Just thought I'd add these in to give some kind of idea as to what I'd enjoy, and maybe you guy point me in the direction? 

I was thinking, maybe Death of Superman, or maybe even read The Dark Knight, although reading something I've watched already tends to be a problem, when I could read new content instead. I'm also unsure where to start for Superman, because I've heard Action Comics gets a lot of praise, but then there's the actual Superman run.. So yeah, any help with that would be great.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've found my love for reading again, after a long and difficult Autumn. So I just have a few questions. 

I was talking to someone a few days back and they adviced that once I read up to 20 (I was on 18 at the time), that I should skip ahead to 34 and avoid Zero Year until I'm caught up, just because it's set in the past and I guess would serve as an origin story? 

So I took his advice and got 34 to 40. But when I started it, it said the setting that is about to take place, is post Eternal. And now Jim Gordon is in prison, something about Catwoman hitting it big?  So should I go back and pick up where I left off Eternal? 

Also, my other odd question. What's up with the artstyle? I'm only a few pages in, but the change in Bruce's stature between 20 and 34 seems odd. I've only seen a few shots of him, but there is one specifically when he is about to get into the Batmobile and straight up looks lean. Way more than he should at least. So is this a change in artist or something? I'm not good with names just yet so I thought I'd ask here. 

Thanks for any help you can give.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'll admit I'm new to all this. I'm not sure how you guys feel about DC, but I started reading DC a few months back and loved it, having never read comics before. 

But I never really thought about Marvel, because in my mind, for some ignorant reason, I thought all Marvel to fit the feeling of the movies, in which it's all happy and family friendly. I'm going to take a wild guess and say I'm wrong. 

But another reason I went with DC is because of the New 52. It gave me a starting ground on where to read and it was pretty simply. Is there a Marvel version of that? Or can I jump in whenever, or is it a certain event I should start reading after?

But a big draw to it right now, is Unlimited. Although I'm questioning it. Will it give me all the older comics? Because without sounding ungrateful, I want the recent stuff, and right now I don't care much for the older stuff, or at least until I get a foothold in the current run and what's what. 

Also, Star Wars.. So I'm not willing to buy Battlefront, but need my Star Wars fix until the movie. So how recent is Unlimited? Because I know this Star Wars run only started this year, does it have it on there? Or is Unlimited on the type of system in which an issue releases, then 6 months later I get that issue on Unlimited? 

This is all incredibly new to me so any help on the matter would be great. Thanks!  </TEXT>

Like, as of now, these are my main weapons: AK, M4A1, AWP, Deagle, and on occasion a Galil/M4A4. 

So is there a case with a bigger chance of getting a skin for one of said guns, or should I just pick up the cheaper cases/keys. 

Honestly I'm still learning my way around the market and whatnot so any help on the matter would be great. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> So I just read The Killing Joke for the first time, after hearing the rumor of the R rated movie... Holy fu.... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-17 13:37:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I knew it was highly proclaimed. And I knew he shot Barbara.. But I expected it to be at the end of the story, and seeing as the rest of it was unknown to me...

I don't know what to say. 

It took me a few pages to adjust to the older artstyle due to the fact that I've only read some New 52 stuff, a bit of Injustice and as of last night, GL Rebirth. 

It was also fascinating seeing, what I guess the one and true Joker origin. It shows he was an anxious, loving husband, who was forced to do one bad thing and suddenly becomes the most haunting villain in the history of DC comics. Also, as far as I remember it, Jason Todd got the Red Hood look from Joker, or pre-Joker I guess. So who is the other Red Hood guy they're pretending to be? 

Then Gordon.. I was sad to see what he went through, but his surroundings caught my attention way more. Those shots of Barbara... Fucking hell. I've heard before that some people believe rape was implied. But I've also heard it was just simply to take pictures for Gordon. And after reading, I can see where people get the idea, but I don't believe it. 

Now.. The last 4 pages of the story.. I've thought about it a bit, thinking about saying it might be my favorite.. But it is. Those 4 pages are truly my favorite piece of writing across any platform. Comic, book, music, movie, tv.. All of it. It was fucking incredible. 

He finally made him break. He made Batman, the embodiment of fear, laugh, and finally lose it. Not only the writing, but the style of it.. Oh the [style] (http://images.sequart.org/images/killing-joke-final-page.png). How it fades to rain. How he grins. How he grabs Joker during his laugh. 

It was a true 10/10 in my mind. That being said, I'd appreciate it if  you could share your opinion on it too, as my 10/10 may be a decimal or two too high. 

Now on to the story that took place after TKJ. We had an un-named guy just telling a story a story to a camera. Which was in fact very, very creepy. But it also felt real. We see this man, this shadow, this idea. He fights villain after villain. We get story after story.. But one day, he could just no longer exist. It's pretty haunting. 

All in all.. What a read. What a truly wonderful read. Thank you /r/Dccomics for helping me into this universe.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know I made a post earlier about WW and Rebirth, but after reading 3 issues of it I only have more questions. 

So Hal was evil because Parallax poisoned his mind, and in the process he killed Sinestro by snapping his neck. Now we have the spirit version of Hal walking around, doing Spectre's vengeance work, because Spectre took control of his soul due to him being evil earlier.. All the while, Hal is still a good guy on his own, but is being torn apart by Spectre because he's committing all of these awful orders, right? But then we see Hal with grey hair go off and do all that awful stuff as he slowly loses his mind, and all the while we see these 3 shots. [1] (https://gyazo.com/9933c7449ab8a2ca6aaf7aafbb4991be) [2]  (https://gyazo.com/cfe670e3561c40a160dacc4fb0387a0e) [3] (https://gyazo.com/b5f593b1cc4c8af00bf3be44adfaf980).. Like this is all him just battling with himself right? The grey haired one is the poisoned, Parallax side of him, while the jacket wearing guy is true Hal, and hooded figure is Spectre? There was also the shot of him walking back to Coast City, after the John flip out I'm guessing.. But that's destroyed, so supposedly, according to grey haired Hal, he rebuilt the city? 

Then we have Guy. A once-was lantern who is now some kind of Warrior. But now he is back to being a lantern after a ring Kyle had went searching for him, but making him an insane person.. And I'm not exactly sure where he went after fucking up the watchtower. 

John is someone who clearly cares for Hal, and seems like another strong lantern with good in his heart, but he flipped out and started destroying the area the JL were in with ghost Hal..? And why exactly? Is the battery that his power source comes from being tainted by Parallax back on Oa? 

Kyle for some reason crash lands on Earth, searching for Guy, or at least the ring was, right? And he for some reason isn't being affected by the madness from the battery? Is it because he is rejecting the power all together, as we see him not want to use it, or is it because he admits to feeling fear, therefore fear has no sway over him and his ring? 

Then at the end of issue 3, we see Sinestro, and it seems like he admitted to freeing Parallax? Or at least woke it.. But Sinestro got his neck snapped. So how is he walking about? Or is it some GL magic that brought him back? 

That seems to be everything on my mind. Apart from wondering if there was meant to be pre-reading before this, but after Kyle explaining to someone what happened (or one of the GL's right now) I seem to have.. Actually I have nothing. I just know that Hal is corrupted as shit right now and Kyle is the savior. Apart from that I'm lost.. And damn would I appreciate some guidance. 

Anyone who made it this far, thank you. I just hope to read what I keep hearing is Geoff John's best run, right? Either way. Thank you. Any help that will untangle the mess I've stepped into would be great.  


EDIT: Okay. The guys were right. Reading the rest of Rebirth cleared it up.. And oh my fuck. That was amazing.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So instead of making two posts I thought I'd do them both here.

So in the JL shot on the thread from like a day or two ago, Bruce was warning Clark about Diana having no weakness, and that he should be careful. So what is her weakness? 

Then Green Lantern...

Due to the movie, I've never really held an interest in the Green Lantern series, until I heard about Coast City lighting up in support of him during Sinestro Wars and thought I'd pick up the series.

But the only GL I know is Hal.. But I've heard whispers of John Stewart, Kyle Rayner.. I may even be listing names that aren't Lanterns, but just in the GL bubble. 

So who are the GL's? And if the opening to rebirth is one of the GL's talking about him being the last.. And the lady whiping dust off a plane to see Jordan on the side of it, meaning he was there at one point.. But then we have John above a baseball stadium?

If someone could help me into this world it'd be great. Thanks!  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-11-15 01:32:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I of course know I need to spend money and do it through steam, but I found the question hard to put in the title.

So when you're buying a key and need to add funds, you're set to a list of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 euro etc. options. 

But what I'm looking for is just adding the required funds. I only have like 3 euro in paypal, but if I had 5 I'd add the 5 to Steam. But in this case I can only really add enough for the key. 

Is there a way to do this or will I just have to wait it out? 

EDIT: I should add in that I can't use the public market because I'm on a new pc as of yesterday, so Steam are shutting down any trades I try to do due to some "new device" protocol. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Oh my.. Injustice really knows how to kick off guns blazing. (Year One Issue 1-2 spoilers) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-13 11:20:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> (UPDATE: I'm updating this post with edits at the bottom so the spoilers will go past issue 1 and 2 now. So just a warning, the edits are now spoilers from Year One in general, seeing as I'm binge reading right now.)

I just had to make this post, and it may even be a shitpost but you be the judge, because I just thought I'd share my thoughts.

So straight off the *bat* I'm enjoying it. Seeing Bruce tell Clark that Lois is pregnant, minutes after found out is hilarious to me. How protective Clark is shows a side to him I haven't seen yet (Justice League is my only source of Superman so far). Then they kill off Jimmy. Right in the first issue. I've heard Injustice has a way of killing off anyone they can, and I know of a few deaths but I'd rather not say.

But by far, my favorite part of this two issue rollercoaster I've been on is seeing Batman call everyone to arms for Lois. 

It may not be much to reading veterans, but seeing him call every justice league member, and everyone in the area, for one missing person, is incredible to me. And knowing the tend to kill off people... With the cover of badass superman.. I'm quite scared being honest. 

I'll most likely update my thoughts when I finish year one, because damn this seems like my kind of writing/art style. Although I've heard it's not the greatest writing out there.. I don't really know the difference just yet, so it seems like I'll be just fine.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on the series though, good or bad. Thanks!

EDIT: OH MY FUCK?!? THAT CHAPTER THREE ENDING WHAAAAAAAAT!?!?!

EDIT 2: Chapter 4 was pretty touching.. But Chapter 5 was pretty fucking hilarious. Also, if this is a series that stands on it's own, who are they referring to in regards to Green Arrows last 3 of 4 women?

EDIT 3: Issue 6 shows a side of Superman I've wanted to see since I started reading back in the summer. It may be dark and wrong, because he's superman of course, but I'm just curious to see how it goes.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> What is your most emotional read? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-12 01:59:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm a big fan of emotional moments when reading or watching something. But seeing as I'm still fairly new to this whole comic world, I only really have a few examples.

I watched All Star Superman, that was heartbreaking. Of course it wasn't reading, like I asked in the title, but at the time I just couldn't spend close to 50 euro on a book with an art style I wasn't a fan of. 

Now I'm reading Batman. I'm on issue 20 right now.. And by god. 18 was heartwrenching. It was Requiem for anyone wondering. It involved a whole lot of Harper, and because of it, was very, very tear jerking IMO. 

That being said, it was the first time I got truly emotional over a comic (Or at least I believe it is, because I may have way back in the Summer and I just don't remember it, but that's neither here nor there).

So my question to you is, what read hit you the hardest. Whether it be with sadness. With joy. With sorrow. With excitement. With triumph. The list could go on but it's 1am and I'm off to bed. 

I'd love to hear your thoughts. Have a good night folks. 

Oh, and if it's a one shot in the way All star Superman was (right?), and you don't 100% need to spoil it, and believe it's worth reading, I'd appreciate that too because I'm always looking for new reads.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I went from having a weird amount of fun creating my character, which as always took 40 minutes or so, only to change him when leaving the vault. And the pre-war stuff was nice, I won't go into story details but it all happens, then you're in the wasteland. 

Within like 30 minutes of kicking off, I now have a power suit to upgrade. A dog to keep track of. And a small village to raise. Yes, of course I don't have to do them, but I assume there are benefits, and I enjoy it at times, but damn is it a lot to take in. (I've also looted every corner I've found since the start of the game and I'm yet to meet a vendor.

So the dog.. I've only really noticed it being useful when fighting in the freedom building, because after I bring her to the sanctuary and head out for combat, he never seems to be around. Do I lose him or what? If I lose him, do I just need to track back all the way or is there a way of calling him/ dismissing him? 

The weapon customization and armor seems fun, I'm getting used to it, but it's a bit of a struggle still just due to how much it all varies, and the fact I have like 20 weapons in my inventory with nowhere to sell them. (I don't have enough caps for a trader stand). 

Building the town.. I can see the idea, and I've destroyed a few buildings for the gear, and I've planted the water hoses but I don't have enough food, and I'm unsure how to put someone on the job of farming it, or does it automatically give someone the job? 

That seems to be it really. The game is fucking incredible, but as I head to bed at 4am, my mind is frying both due to tiredness, and the insane amount of stuff I have to do.

So any help on this matter would be really appreciated. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So as I wait for Fallout 4, I've been watching footage of the perk system and how it works (nothing major, but videos made to help new players).

Then I watched a video on class guides, in which he'd show what stats I should take for a melee setup, a sniper setup, a pacifist setup, and a generalist.

So having never really played a class in the previous games (I have maybe a day play time, across however many years it's been out, across NV and 3), I have a few questions. 

How exactly does a melee class work? Like would that not be the hardset class to play due to range and certain situations, maybe a large group of super mutants, a room full of security robots, etc. 

Are there any other classes out there or are the ones I mentioned the main ones? If so, which is the easiest for new comes?   </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-11-01 01:04:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So as a guy currently in school, the next two weeks are straight up torture for me. I've grinded it out to have enough spare cash for at least one game.. The only question is which one. 

At one point it was Battlefront just on the basis it was Star Wars.

Then for the last 2 weeks or so it was Black Ops 3 because I found Nadeshot and the whole Optic 'scene' again. I was hyped enough to buy AW, then prestige in and sell it again, just so I could get the loyalty camo. 

And today I saw screenshots of Fallout 4.. And I'm really torn right now, because I was all set for BO3, but Fallout 4.. It's Fallout. 

Anyone else here struggling to choose, or willing to help a guy make a choice?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm gonna be brutally honest. After the cutscene about choosing to go pro or not, I start skipping cutscenes. It's a mix of both not coming to an nba game for a story, and during the cutscenes, it's really hard to take anything seriously with the weird as fuck face animations going on. When my character is talking about choosing the path for his life, I don't want that creepy as fuck Shrek grin.

Okay, enough ranting about it, what is the story actually like? Should I be paying attention to it, or am I fine just playing the game for the gameplay?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A big reason I'm a fan of the nba 2k games is the soundtrack. But I just listened to all I do is win and damn is that song censored to hell. Of course the song is still the song but when they're cutting out "bitch" it gets a bit weird. 

Is there a way to get rid of this, or will I just have to try find the soundtrack on Spotify? 

EDIT: I'm going to add this in with the hopes I get some help. Can someone help with the MyCareer Player Settings? I'm looking up rules now, but does the scoring style matter? The height to weight ratio? The Wingspan, bodylength (?), and shoulder width? 

Any help would be great because I'd love to get into this game but damn am I confused right now. 

EDIT 2: I just chose Small Forward and went with the recommended selections. Also, I hope Small Forward was the right option for a 3 point shooter. I'm 100% clueless going into this game.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Can I get some opinions on the sports games of the year? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-29 21:28:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Basically, I'm looking to buy a sports game. I'm not going for fifa, that's just a big no-no. 

But apart from that, and not being in the US, I'm not quite which one to go for. I've had madden and nba before, and enjoyed both but got tired of them due to other games. But now I look to get one for when I don't need to give hours of my day to a game, and just play it for a bit each day. 

So Madden.. I'm not really sure what to say as the last I played was maybe 14. I enjoy it, but when going to be a pro, I'd only really know how to play qb so that narrows down the variety. 

NBA.. The soundtrack is usually fucking awesome, and I enjoy the be a pro version of that, although I was really bad at it (kept going for 3's as a beginning player).

NHL.. I've never really played an NHL game that much, aside from the demos, and it seems fun, but I never go much further into it, although I'm willing to. What is that like in terms of be a pro, manager mode etc. 

MLB.. I went through a baseball phase at the beginning of the summer but it died down due to, well.. I'm in Ireland, baseball isn't exactly the number one sport here, and without a console to get a game on, I slowly fell away from that. And being completely honest, I have no idea what that game is like, but any insight to it would be great. 

All of these games of course, come with some kind of pack opening, dream-team type gamemode, right? Which is the most fun? 

Honestly, you don't need to have mastered all these games, but if you've played one well enough to give a strong opinion on it, I'd appreciate it. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I chose Triss. I knew going in that Triss and Yen were to be a love triangle, but having never played 1 or 2, I had no idea how important Yen was to Geralt. I only knew of Yen from the meeting in Vizima, and from that I found her a bit.. Bitchy for lack of words. Then Triss, this down to earth, loving, compassionate girl comes along. So of course I chose her, having no knowledge of previous story or lore. 

Now I'm in Skellige and damn Yen is getting a lot of screen time. It's also showing how important they are to eachother. But I've also heard if I romance Yen too, I'll end up with neither of them, so I've sworn not to touch Yen. (I also romanced Keira earlier so I'm not sure how that will tie in..) 

So back to my point, those of you that chose Triss, was it worth it? I've heard Yen gets more screen time. Yen is more important to Geralt. Yen is a motherly figure to Ciri (Who I'm still trying to find.. Damnit). All I hear of Triss is that she's more compassionate than Yen, and she openly 'feels' more, if you get me.

Any thoughts on the matter, without spoiling anything major from this game I'd appreciate it. Thanks!

EDIT: Oh, and I've also read that people are hoping for more Triss screentime in one of the dlc's. Could this be a thing? Are the dlc's continuing from where I end the game, and in so it's up to me if she appears? I don't know. This whole thing is confusing me a bit with consequences and dlcs, etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have cash for a dlc pack, but I'm not sure which one. Being honest I haven't looked into it much because it'll only really show the maps and guns, but I'm interested in the thoughts of the players when it comes to those subjects. 

How do the maps play on each pack, what are the guns like? What are the vehicles like? One of the packs is hevily infulenced on open water combat right? So does that hold up compared to a very ground and gun-skilled based pack (for lack of a better description). 

Any thoughts on the packs would be great, thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I just got to meet Radovid in the chess club (at least I think it was Radovid, as a speech option was something about meeting a king) and I realized I know very little about this war and who is the 'good' guy here. So a bit of researching I came across something that spoiled an ending for me. 

It was that if I support Radovid it ultimately leads to the death of Geralt. And from what I've read, Redanian's (?) are somewhat the victims of this war because Nilfgaard are charging in here for 'one united realm' or whatever right? So I planned on supporting them..

But is the final end for supporting Radovid, the death of Geralt, or is there an ending in which I support Rad and still live? 

If the answer is yes, just say yes, please, I don't want to know about any more endings. I'd also like to know if Geralt is going to die because I supported the wrong guy, after putting all these hours in.  </TEXT>

Even just getting a frying pan from the hut, it was hilarious to see her come closer and closer to him as he backs off. 

So does the quality of content stay the same the later you get into the game? Because right now I am fucking *swamped* in quests, and some are 20-30 levels too high for me, so I'll have them for later.

<TEXT> So I'll be honest. I'm not a big Fallout player. I've played both 3 and New Vegas multiple times, but never to the end. 

The furthest I got in 3 was just after meeting the dad and he gives you a job, and in New Vegas.. I really can't remember.

But when I hear Fallout I think of fun, of adventure, of a game I love to play, even though I don't play it that much. (I just found it to be too clunky or robotic)

But when I saw the countdown for the Fallout 4 trailer, I knew the minute I heard the announcement, that I'd being buying this game. 

But as it comes close to Christmas money is getting tight and other games are being released. 

So in the hopes that I get tipped over the edge here, what convinced you to buy this game?

Oh, and I'll just leave an example. I'm installing the patches right now for GTAV, which take up 7gb, but checking my storage space it says the game takes up 50 or something mad.

<TITLE> If someone's only way of 'reading' a book was through audiobook. Would you consider them a reader? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So this is not a hate on audiobook listeners out there, simply because I'm one of them quite often. 

Basically, I've been wondering, I consider myself a reader right? But when it comes to 'ingesting' a book so to speak, I find myself willing to listen to it more than I would sit down and read it. 

So if you had someone who read 100 books, you would consider them a reader right? Would you still consider them a reader if they listened to all 100 instead of physically reading? 

Nothing major going on, just a though I've been having and I'm curious as to your thoughts.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> What book would you recommend I read after a Briefer History of Time? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-04 01:44:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've always loved space and science. But only now, at 19, with one school year left before college (the age to school year ratio is a long story), I've finally decided to step up and teach myself what I need to know about space, physics, that general kind of field you understand (forgive me if there's a word for it, and if there is I'd appreciate you leaving it below). 

So I bought Hawking's A Briefer History of Time a while back and am only now reading it, and I'm enjoying it. I went out with the idea of getting A Brief History of Time but it was out of stock, and after reading this for 3 chapters I'll admit I'm glad I got this instead of the more in depth version. 

So in the next few weeks, depending on how busy I am, I'll be finished with this. Where should I go next? Is The Grand Design something I should look for? 

Any suggestions on single books or collections would be great, as I have to buy and read them all myself because my school doesn't teach science. 

Thanks.

EDIT: I'd also like to add in I'd be willing to listen to podcasts, watch shows, documentaries, movies etc. I'm willing to try all sides of media to learn. </TEXT>

But how do we know we're close? I'm just thinking out loud right now, but I'd guess those in the past also thought they were at the edge of all possible knowledge.
So could it be true that we are in fact nowhere near the end of this theory we search for, and in fact, what we know now is 0.00001% of what it takes for said theory? </TEXT>

If you get the 4 wizards as the spawn, you'll most likely drop in framerate. Not just a few frames, but to the point of playing in slow motion. I don't think there's anything Bungie could do, since it's most likely just the particles or something like it that is destroying the power the 360 has.

<TEXT> So when it came to Destiny in year one, a big reason I got into it was because of the raids. Hearing about the jumping puzzle in VoG. The dark run in Crota.. 

But this time around, I fucking love the non-raid content. Running dailies in year one felt like a job without the fun of printing spreadsheets. Now I'm glad I have dailies, because these missions are fucking awesome in terms of content and variation. Even the strikes are all incredibly different. From fighting a boss ass shank in a battle arena to fighting an Oryx wanna be in a pit of darkness. 

Damnit, I know it's just another praise post but damnit I love this so far.  </TEXT>

If we assume Patrick has PKA in among the footage it's looking Monday. If Woody brought his own storage for it, we're in the dark right now.

<DATE> 2015-09-05 01:14:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I installed the game earlier this evening. I have about 2 and a half hours logged, just going off the fact that the prologue said total play time was 2 hours. Which I don't actually understand, does that take in the time of sitting at pause menus and the home screen?

Okay, on to the actual question. So I got to the first little checkpoint,found a lonesome guard, marked him, crawled my way up to him, equipped my arm because.. just because really. then I took his gun. I panicked. Didn't want to kill him in case it effected my score. Equipped another weapon so I could drop his. Figured out I could just knock him out by hitting RT. Hid him behind a rock. Moved on around the little camp. Then a minute or two later after getting another guard I was spotted by someone who was back where I got the first guy. Did he wake up already or is there a chance I missed someone? It would have only been 50 seconds to a minute and 1/2. Are knock out timers that short?

Is the tranq gun the way to go instead of making sure I go hand to hand for every knockout?

Does killing a guard matter to my score? In terms of a takedown being 100 and a gun kill being 50 etc. 

What's the deal with the online part of this game and the need for servers? I've been told to update to use the online features but can't seem to track it down. Does it matter?

Any other tips in that pop into your head would be great. Thanks.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So before we start, I have only really been reading Batman and some Nightwing as part of Death of the Family. I tried Batman and Robin but I kind of half read it while at bus stop or something. So I just finished Death of the Family, which.. Well, if you've read it you know, it was incredible to me. But I also was expecting the Joker to kill Damian. I thought the entire thing would lead up to that, becuase I understand issue 18 of B R is incredible sad and whatnot, so I expected that to be his death. I have read Batman 1-17 and B R 15-17, just to get a feel for the work without going all the way back to the start, I'm just not that big into it. But, Damian is already dead? Yet I haven't seen it. 

So I googled it, found out he dies in Batman, Inc in issue 8. How.. How exactly does this go? Was Batman Inc a later release than the other 2 series and therefore issue 8 dropped just before 18? Batman, Batman and Robin are both titled Requiem so I know they're connected, but having never read Incorporated, what's going on there?

Any help would be great, in regards to if I should read 1-8 of Inc to get a better feel for Damian or if I should read 18 then continue on with Batman. (I just don't see myself going further with B R yet because I have a lot to read. I just had to live this moment, if you understand me.)

<DATE> 2015-08-30 03:27:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've been reading Death of the Family for a good few weeks now. It's partially due to the fact that I bought it digital instead of physical so that puts a toll on it, but it's also the fact that I'm new to a lot of the series' I'm reading. 

Like I'm just not a fan of Catwoman in general, I don't know why, I just never got behind her. I also have no idea what makes Detective Comics different to Batman. I don't really know Red Hood and the Outlaws or Teen Titans (although I may get into that one day because I'm a fan of Arsenal thanks to the Arrow show).

But that's basically it. I'm really struggling to get through this arc because I'm making sure I read every issue involved. I understand I can straight up just read Batman but I also feel like I'd be missing a lot of details if I avoid an issue or two. I also know the end of this arc so I need to get a grasp on the situation in my mind but to get a real connection I've heard I should read Batman Inc before getting to the end, which I doubt I'll do because I just don't have the time. 

So I can't be alone in this thinking right? I want to give up my mindset and only read Batman right now, then later come back for Nightwing, Batgirl, and maybe Teen Titans. Or should I keep going with this and eventually my mind will get adjusted to it?

Any help on the matter would be great. Thanks folks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So this is kind of a spur of the moment post and I'm not sure how readers will react but I'd like to hear your thoughts.

So for the longest time now I've used the review section for buying games on Steam. Of course there are actual reviews, with pros and cons lists, rating systems, solid reviews in general.

But lately, it's just all bad what I'm seeing. Some people have 2k hours played with a negative review and the only words are "eh.. Played it". "Did this, with this, this happened. 50/10." Like. With the 2k hours you can assume it's worth a try in some cases but all these sarcastic comments and stuff everywhere now just don't help. 

It's coming off as very ranty but I'll make my last point and leave. So Black Ops 3. Not many people care for CoD anymore and some may even ignore my opinion as a "cod fanboy" or whatever but I actually haven't played one in 3 years now so I was curious. I checked out Black Ops 3 and from the people I know, follow, they really like it. They enjoy this beta more than the entire previous cod and whatnot. "The return of Cod" although said about each new cod, it still stands. 

So looking through the review section I see stuff like "Advanced titanfall: destiny ops 3" then something like "WHOA RUN ON WALLS! WHOA DOUBLE JUMP!" that goes on for a bit. If you see the reviews you get it.

So I'm just wondering. Am I taking this way too seriously or should there be an actual review system? Because I for one rely quite a bit on the thoughts of someone who has played the game because I: 1) Dont have a lot of cash to be buying games I later regret. 2) Don't have faith in many review videos at this point. 

Any thoughts, like I said, would be appreciated. Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I've looked at TTK at a new Destiny game right? My only past experience with a yearly release with a set date is CoD. The date wasn't set but the idea was. The same kinda game, new face. But that's not the point. The main point was how I'd need to get the day off for it. 

So I panicked knowing I couldn't get the day off for this. Then I heard the actual activation for it doesn't start until a certain time and it'll most likely be the evening GMT when it starts. 

Is this true? Please tell yes, I need help, thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm not the best writer when it comes to reviewing a movie and I understand how often this story is praised and how many love it but I thought I'd share a few notes I wrote down while watching.

So the first thing I picked up on was the night he returns. The cop in the car with the rookie, even before he said it, I knew what it was because of Nolan. The "You're in for a treat tonight" line, right? Now that I know it comes from this story I'm really impressed with Nolan.

The reported that misread Gordon's death.. I went from my jaw hanging to giggling a bit. Well played writers. 

So.. The entire part from when Robin leaps in to when he walks away to the cave. I cried for 90% of that 'scene'. It may have been the soundtrack at the time, I'm not sure. Or it may have been how often Jason is referenced. Or that I'm currently on my first read of Death of the Family and I know how that ends.. It was just a surge of emotion and I couldn't hold it. I'm also now really curious on this version of Robin and why I've never heard of her. 

So to the batcave. What was the deal with him going to the bat? Was it just a symbol of how he'll never truly be done with the Batman? I'm guessing so, so I'll stop there. 

The soundtrack.. If you've heard it I have nothing more to say because you know it. Phenomenal is the word I'm going with. 

Then the last note I took was the line "
This is not a mudhole. This is an operating table. And I'm the surgeon.".. Like.. What a perfect line for the moment. It just shows how even with his age, he is still Batman in mind and in body. At least partially, for me anyway, but I do know very little so I may be wrong.

And there are my thoughts. I'd honestly love to hear your guys' thoughts on the movie because I just need to speak right now. BUT. I'll be a while on the replies, about to start Part 2.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I'm not sure how to ask this but can someone help with understanding Superman comics a bit? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-26 17:24:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So before we start this question may be jumbled or show an ignorance beyond compare. Okay, here goes. 

So Superman is my favorite hero. The idea that he just shines perfection and hope is amazing to me. But when I picked up my first single hero comic it was  Batman (I read up to Trinity War in JL before it, but that was a team thing). And in that we see Batman get in some real shit (The Court of Owls arc is what I read).

So now I'm wondering about Superman. His main comic is Action Comics right? Or at least that's what people say you should read. But about the normal Superman comic? 

So what makes a Superman comic give you the same feeling of dread and fear as a batman comic does? Or is it's goal to be funny and light? Because when I think of how a Superman plot goes, I can only really think of a few villains. Lex, Braniac, Doomsday, Darkseid (although he's a main JL villain right?).

So what makes a normal issue or arc without the mainstream villains great? 

Any help on the matter or pointing me to what version of him I should read would be great. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I don't really mean motivation in the way of Good Will Hunting exactly. 

I'm planning on going fitness heaving come next Monday so I want to hype myself up for it instead of letting it slide and not be into it. I understand that's a lot more on my willpower than a movie choice but that's my own little demon. 

So I watched the trailer for Creed. Like that trailer, to me at least, was fucking awesome. I have no idea how the film is going to be but that trailer had me hyped for boxing. As did the Southpaw trailer, which also ruins a major part of the movie but back to my point.

If you want both of those trailers you'd get the feeling I'm looking for. Not specifically a boxing movie, but a movie in general with a character overcoming something and at the same time having that feeling to it( that we get in Southpaw and Creed).

I don't know. I may be talking out of my ass but some suggestions would be great. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I was gearing up for bed when my sister said she's staying up a bit later to see mars beside the moon. 

After some googling I've found there is a major hoax going around that is saying Mars will be the same size as the moon and it's been going on since 2003.

But with that, is there a sign of Mars at all or is the entire notion of Mars being visible without a telescope a truly dumb idea?

I know this may be an awful read for those of you that know what you're talking about but I'm just a curious lover of space with very little actual knowledge of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I got a puppy a week ago, a husky to be exact. Before hand however I had a jack russell-terrier mix I believe (it's not my dog). Ever since they met, they got on well, the 'play' fight a lot but Im really starting to notice how often the terrier stands over the husky. Of course it's simply because she's bigger but in 6 months to a year or so the husky is going to tower over this terrier. So seeing as the husky won't give in to the terrier standing over her, should I just expect this to go a year until the husky is in pure physical control and stands over the terrier?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So back a few weeks ago when I asked what comics I should start off with I listed Injustice as an option just because I played the game and knew it was a comic series. I then left it behind because I read a comment saying it wasn't that good and I can leave it. 

Now I see a few posts around showing slides of Injustice. I specifically remember year 4 though. So that leads to another question. Is there a release system? Like has it been going for four years now and they just change the title by year? That sounds awfully dumb but that's what I am in this field.

So yeah.. Should I pick it up? I'm a fan of the artstyle and curious about it in general. Especially after letting one guys opinion sway me from an entire series. Although that series could be 21 issues long or 200. I really have no idea.

<TEXT> So this is an odd one. I've never thought about buying the game until scrolling through a list and for some reason it stood out this time.

On release though, I heard it was the most underwhelming thing ever. Something about the graphics being overplayed at E3 or something (typical Ubisoft stuff)..

So. What was the game actually like? Was the story good? The whole hacking the world thing, how was it? Was it open world? How did it feel.

That all being for 360 though, because I've now come to realize how massive the gap is between 360 and One. 

So if you could answer those questions I'd really appreciate it. In the end, 22 euro for it? Should I? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I've been thinking about BvS again and.. Well it's obvious with the title that they're pushing Batman fighting Superman. But lets be real, they're most likely going to team up about 3/4's in and fight a bigger villain simply because Justice League. Then we also have Wonder Woman fighting someone and somehow they get Aquaman into the movie right? So I believe they're hiding the true villain. Could the villain be Lex? Or are they setting up another stand alone superman movie with all of Lex's kryptonite knowledge. 

Then we have people like Doomsday, Darkseid, Braniac.. I don't know any more really and I'm sorry but yeah.

Who can we expect to see? I read a comment once saying Doomsday brings together Batman, Superman, WW, Aquaman and they go for him. But the comment after was how giving Doomsday this early would be blowing the load too early. But having only read up to Trinity War, Darkseid seems like the ultimate JL villain. So where would someone like Doomsday fit? If at all. 

I feel in over my head here but I'm interested to see what fans are thinking.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A reason to why I'm late to the movie.

Okay. So the day of release, I was talking with a friend about this movie. He said I should go see it, and was convincing me why. Then friend B comes across, hey, oh, Gone Girl? Yeah, don't see it, she's never even dead.


Knowing that.. I never bothered watching because I thought her being alive would be a final act type moment. So knowing she was behind it, I really couldn't get into the movie because, although I could see how amazingly he was set up to take the hit, even the way he moves, sneaks around etc. It was incredible to watch even though I hated knowing the outcome.


Then she shows up way too early and from that point on I was in love. I am stupid late to the Pike train but.. Oh my god. It was just true perfection in my eyes.


I now understand why people hate the ending. Why would it end like that? was there a reason? Did the movie go over time? I'm so confused. </TEXT>

So this may be rare of course because a lot of people watch at a monitor but I decided to listen to 241 on a run this week and well.. I spent 8 minutes jogging listening to guys talk about a video, in which the only thing I took from it at the time was a lot of 'ghetto shouting' and of course the pka commentary which did help a bit.

But yeah, it may be a lesser problem for a lot of people but from jogging with it on in my pocket. Listening to it on my laptop while I'm in a fullscreen game. People driving in their car. 

I just thought I'd share my mind on this matter, not sure how you guys feel, I'd like to know, but to avoid this being a full 'negative' post if you wanna call it that, I'm honestly just trying to be constructive, I have to say it was a fun episode and I can't wait for the PKA trip. </TEXT>

But, I've often heard just go with your favorite looking class because traits are obsolete within 20-30 levels. 

So should I go with what I like to look at more and go Worgen or should I go for traits and play with a really ugly race? (In my opinion of course, I understand a lot of you may like it. Just not what I enjoy)

I would watch normal documentaries but I tend to be running, walking my dog, gaming, etc. So when I can't watch it I'd like to listen. 

So yeah.. If someone could point me to some audio only documentaries it'd be great. </TEXT>

But I know to do that it takes a lot of work and not just saying "i deserve to be ____".

So those of you that are up in those leagues. What are some things I should be writing down before and after games? Stuff like always take this spell vs ___. Ban ____ if you're planning on going ____. 

I'm not really sure to be honest and that's why I'm here. I main support so it may be things like start 3 pots if you're going to play passive under tri bush. Or tri get Mikaels second to deal with the Annie stuns. 

Both of those examples may be awful but that's why I'm here.

Any help would be appreciated. Just looking to find out what I should be keeping an eye on. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How hard is later game Mistweaver? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-27 14:34:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So right now I'm leveling my first healer and it happens to be a Mistweaver. I'm level 21 right now and so far I've done 3 dungeons. After going from solo to being the only healer I realized I needed to switch stances right? 

After that all I've had to do is cast soothing mist on the tank followed with a few surging mists when needed. 

That is basically it so far. I have things for debuffs, poisons, then a revive of course. So far no need for that.

But looking around I've found people say late game Mistweaver is a higher skill level for some reason. I honestly have no idea so this could be complete bs and if so, sorry for saying it.

But yeah.. As someone who is not too great at this game. Should I level another healer before jumping into monk or am I fine running along here? I'm not going to be overwhelmed later and be pushed away from healing am I? 

Any help would be great. Thanks! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-07-25 00:27:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm just wrapping up the Court of Owls read (a few pages into #12 I believe) and I'm preparing for another really awkward to read crossover. Awkward is the only word I could come up with but I hope you get what I mean. 

Having read the Court of Owls in order of a guide I found online I struggled a bit. Looking back, apart from Catwoman having to fight a Talon her part in it was unnecessary and I really didn't enjoy it. I also wasn't a fan of Red Hood although I'm still giving him a chance. Everything Batman was just a pure joy to read though.

Okay.. Back on topic here holy shit. So Death of the Family, according to the DC app, is 24 issues consisting of the same few characters except they throw in Suicide Squad for Catwoman so yay to that. I can't link it because the dc web page doesn't have the same setup. 

But I noticed it doesn't have Batman and Robin #17 listed in it. It ends at Batman 17. Although it does have B R 15+16 so that's why I'm here. 

Another guide had a few oddball issues added in that don't quite catch my attention, a Detective Comics 16 I believe that isn't listed. Or 17, not sure. Then this guide also throws in B R 17 with Batgirl 17 too. 

So just wondering, is this a one off thing with it leaving out what I believe to be a pretty important issue (although I've never read it, I have only heard whispers which I've browsed vaguely to not spoil it for myself) or are the story arcs on the app fan submitted type deals? 

Really just looking to not miss out on anything right now but by god is hard and brain melting.  

EDIT: Sorry about that title, just read it after posting and damn it hurts to read.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So... I've only ever had one character really. A 96/97 human hunter. I've tried others but it was on the end of my interest so I never found a second class.

Coming back in I want to start a new character but I have no idea where to start. 

Honestly, I want to play a tank or a healer. But at the same time I don't know what class fits. Before I left I heard the monk healing class was pretty weak and disc priests were a thing or not a thing..? 

I don't really know much about tanks other than I don't want to be a warrior one. 

So, as vague as it all is, I'd really appreciate some help finding a new class to come back with. Also, not the most difficult classes if you get me? Like I'd be stretching across my keyboard since I don't own a naga or anything fancy. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Can someone help me wrap my head around the bat family in Night of the Owls? (Spoilers for Batman and Robin I'm guessing?) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-22 00:21:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, so before we start. I'm just guessing this but I've heard a lot about issue 17 or 18 of Batman and Robin, how it's incredibly sad. I'm pretty sure I've seen the cover and because of it I'm assuming Robin dies right? Or Jason Todd dies? 

This is where I get confused. If he died 17 issues in B R and is now in Red Hood and the outlaws talking about his death, is this the first example of separate comics not staying on the same continuity or along the lines of it?

So we have Nightwing who is Dick Grayson. I just read 1-7 so I know his story.

Then we have Red Hood, who I'm guessing was the old Robin, aka Jason Todd.

Then Robin, who upon looking at Batman #1 is the kid right, Damien? Or is he the one to die in the future B R. I'd find that much sadder to be honest, even though I don't know Damien.

But that ties back around to, if Damien dies, what's up with Todd? Do I need to read something before New 52? Is it from a separate series?  

Then Tim Drake is Red Robin right? I only know from issue 1 too.

So if you stick with me here for a minute, I just started the Nightwing issue. Now who the f*ck is he? I haven't heard of him so far.

The I have an idea about Batgirl from Nightwing but not too much about her other than she's Jim Gordon's daughter right? 

Catwoman is Catwoman.

I'm not sure if that's everyone or not but yeah.. I'm pretty stuck right now so any help would be great. 

Thanks guys!

Oh, and during the time Nightwing was with Batgirl in 5-6 I believe, he said he didn't think she was ready to get back out there so soon after the Joker or something? Does that mean The Killing Joke story carried over through New 52? I'm not sure how everything works in regards to that but I'm just guessing because it's the only instance of Batgirl-Joker I know about so far. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I went out today and picked up my first Batman comic. The Court of Owls. I also picked up City of Owls too because well.. 1 and 2 are clearly where to start right?

Not from what I've heard. I may be wrong but you can of course read 1-12 without adding in anything right? But I've heard Night of Owls takes place between Court and City. Court being the intro, Night being the action, City being the outro. After that we move on to the Joker or something right in Death of the Family? Never mind, I'm getting ahead of myself.
So yeah, just wondering, I'm towards the end of Court and need to know. Do I pick up Night of Owls before starting City?

Thanks!

<TEXT> So I just had my first moment of sadness reading a comic. It is just over half of the way through the Trinity War trade.

Batman, Katana, Deadman and the Stranger are in heaven. During this entire little segment I felt like letting a tear loose but I never did. Everything from seeing Katana's piece to Batman not live out his memory, just witness it (which is probably the saddest thing I've read so far). 

Then the Stranger got wiped from existence. I didn't expect it. He accepted it and that's that. Because it's a comic he may return at a later point, I doubt it though. ( I also don't want to know so don't tell me, thanks).

But yeah. I found it weird how 3 weeks ago I knew nothing of the comic world apart from mainstream tv and movies and now here I am wiping away a tear for Batman's created memory. 

So what are some of your memories? I heard about a certain moment in All Star Superman that may be for a lot of people although I haven't read it yet I can't wait.

I already want to buy it. No gameplay. No idea what I do other than I heard it becomes a job late game... But I can't wait for Monday because I'm pretty certain I'm gonna buy, sub, whatever it is you do with this game.

Shoutout to that redditor who's name is escaping me. You told me to install, you helped me through, I shall add you in a few hours when I'm done here! 

All in all, glad to have found another community I can hopefully be a part of.

<TEXT> So I don't really mean like the one time this character goes here. 

I'm thinking more like Trinity War. I'm reading it right now and it's amazing to me because I've only really read Justice League so far so seeing all these new characters is amazing right now. 

But what else is there? Like Flashpoint right? That's a crossover? Could I jump into that without prior knowledge or where should I start?

I'm trying to ask a question that I don't know how to ask because I'm not sure what I'm looking for (being new to this world) so any help at all would be great.

Oh, and PS: I'm looking at trying All Star Superman just because I heard about how it ends and was wondering if the lead up to it is good enough to justice 30 euro for the full story?

EDIT: To be honest. Anything at all that you consider must read. Just a simple one issue or series or even arc. Like during Comic Con I heard the Dark Knight Returns is one of the best batman comics of all time? So I should read that right? Then the new Batman started off with Court of Owls which was also supposedly great right?

Just help me ;-; </TEXT>

Is there a way to help this? I really want to give reading on mobile a go because of travel and price it's between 17-20 euro for a trade compared to 11 on the dc app.

<DATE> 2015-07-13 13:17:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It was a pretty weird episode IMO. We learned more about Paul and how he hates himself for what he likes and it looks more like he's using Em (Emily?) as a scapegoat for it with this marriage. Which would also explain the need for Viagra right?

Then we have Frank. He, IMO, had a really, really poor script this episode.

But the gun fight which I made the title for. It was fucking amazing. The start to it was a bit cliche in the fact even thought main characters are at the front the two guys just behind them get shot but after that it did a pretty good job at showing how a real gunfight would go down right? I've never been in one but if there were to be one, I'd imagine the pace, intensity, chaos and death would be just like it was here.

+Rachel McAdams stole the show this episode in my mind. Everything from the internal affairs arc to how she reacted after running out of rounds and then reacting to the deaths (although Farrell really showed the regret and guilt in that snippet) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So recently I bought Revelations. I bought it off the simple remembrance of the ending and how much I enjoyed it. Also how incredible the trailer for it is.

That being said, I also forgot how old it was. How we've now had 4 AC games since this so mechanics and whatnot are pretty rusty. Then again, so am I so..

But yeah. AC3 is by far my favorite in the series. I don't remember much of the story and I remember a lot of criticism for Konor/Conor/Connor (however it was spelled) about how he had no real depth apart from going on a revenge case. I don't really mind that though. I just fucking love the setting. The hunting. The tree running. The Summer. The Winter. The forests. The towns. I loved the setting. But I also thought I'd love playing with bombs again in AC Rev which I've been struggling with.

So someone who has played it recently, how well does it hold up?

EDIT: I really don't get this flair system so I went with misleading just because I'm not spoiling anything nor making assumptions about future games. So.. Yeah.  Odd system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So this is just out of sheer curiosity but... Could Jeyne have been pregnant? 

I'm only a chapter or two past the red wedding so if there is further mention of this later in the books please tag em up. Thanks :)

So in the book. Robb leaves Jeyne as he goes to the Freys. She runs after, they kiss and hug a bit more, he leaves her behind. He dies. No mention of her apart from she's the reason for his betrayal right?

In the show though. She is there with him and they both die. While she's pregnant. The Robb Stark line never happens.

But what if George has it in store for us. A Stark son has been born far away and it's yet to be revealed because of the chaos the realm is in.

How would the show pull that shit off after killing his wife?

I really don't know much of Jeyne so this could be way off and she's dead or something already just later in the books or she did sneak away.

Just a thought that popped into my head as I got into bed. Love to hear your thoughts on the idea. Thanks </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just thought I'd raise this topic although I'm not sure how often it gets asked, if at all.

So who's your favorite character in the DC universe?

I'm super new to the actual comics but the Flash is it for me right now. Simply because of the show. Everything from how he is all about doing good, stepping up, not taking that extra step that the arrow does (although it's an interesting conflict)... I might just binge season 1 again. Or pick up some Flash comics (no idea where to start though).

So yeah. It doesn't have to be a super well known character either. I just chose him because I know him the most I guess because of my little experience in the universe.

<DATE> 2015-07-05 23:02:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The little arc we get after "Super Seven" is Pandora right? I'm beyond confused about what's going on there but I know I'm soon to find out right?

But is that there just to set up the Trinity War? Also, is the Trinity War it's own volume of the Justice League collection or will I need to pick it up between 4-5 or something? Is there anything else I should before it too?

Thanks!

If you show up and notice I often ask the same question to two different replies I'm just looking to get a variety of answer and the question may apply to both replies of this post. Sorry if it looks spammy to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So taking in there's a Justice League movie slowly in the making and Gal is the first piece of it being that she's in BvS. Also Aquaman but is he going to be in BvS or what?

Getting off track here..

So assuming it's the Justice League with Superman, Batman, Flash, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and Cyborg. Who would you cast as Cyborg?

PS: Also, how many different versions of the JL are there? I know there's one with Martian Manhunter (forgive me if it's wrong) right? Who does he replace in that version or is there just 8 in that case? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So if you read my post a few days back, I bought my first comic and its the New 52 Justice League. So right now I care for nothing other than Justice League.

Right now I need a wallpaper. I've googled it and found nothing. And by nothing I of course mean I can't decide. 

Right now I'm rocking [This] (http://p1.pichost.me/i/26/1494135.jpg) 

I really, really like [This] (https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/39/3b/2b/393b2b0581e1a78e2a74955ea3ee198e.jpg) but it's only 5 and I'm aiming for the 7. 

Any help would be great, or just thoughts in general. Thanks! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-07-04 01:23:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm not going to go into episode by episode details and whatnot but just a few things.

The intro, imo, couldn't have been any better. It sets the tone for the series to me.

The reveal of the villain was perfect. You think they're just showing us a clip of the detectives doing a run around job... No. You slowly see the scars on his face. I honestly leaned forward in awe, eyes glistening as my mind realized who it was. 

What can I say about the actors that hasn't already been said? Woody is the perfect down south, roughing it, old school guy they needed to counteract McConaughey's tidier, observant detective. 

There are a lot of other things to point out but Episode 1 of the new season just downloaded so I'm giving it a try, although I've heard it's not quite as good and even though this show did a lot for McConaughey I still can't imagine getting invested in either Vaughn or Farrell.

Love some thoughts on the matter because as you can see, I'm struggling with what I should talk about.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So my local book store has starting selling comic books. And by starting I mean it's been there a few months now apparently I just never realized.

So I bought The New 52, Justice League. Honestly, I was looking for Injustice but they didn't seem to have it so this was next because I heard about it from DJ at Sourcefed. 

So it's a complete revamp of the of the Justice League right? Hence THE NEW 52! I'm guessing every dc kind of has his/her own revamp but I just picked up the collection with 7 characters. 

So... Without getting too complex about this. After this series, would I be able to pick up one of the Batman series, I'm not sure of any names, the only one I know is Nightfall and I'm pretty sure that's just one big novel. But you know, a collection of 5-6 books. Or should I ask the store to order an "original" Batman series?

I'm sorry if this question is convoluted or idiotic in the way it's written, I'm just super excited right now because this is my first ever comic book.. (I'm 18 /3) 

THANKS!

<TEXT> I love a good Assassins Creed trailer. When you see Ezio in Rome, I loved it. When you see the pirate story for Kenway, loved it. 

But Revelations.. Dear god. Everything from him on the ship, him in the mountains, then him getting shot with an arrow which led to a massive fight, and bang, he sees fucking Altair.

IMO, this is the best AC trailer so far.

<TEXT> EDIT: FORGOT TO ADD THEORY SORRY! It's all a theory I guess!

So Jon is "dead". Everyone at HBO right now is saying he is dead.

We all know he ain't dead though. But HBO have to keep up the cliffhanger for the folks around that are too... Well, they haven't figured it out yet. 

So do we want some Jon in the trailer or should they make his little plot a very sad one, showing it like he is dead. Maybe his body on a table. Then when the season starts it was Mel who had his body on a table before Azor rises.

Or do we want some Jon, alive, in the trailer? I for one couldn't think of a better hype up.

I'm getting off my own topic but thinking about the shit we're gonna get for the trailer that is like 8 months away...

Blind Arya, Sam becoming a maester, Jaime finding Cersei, Cersei losing her mind, Tommen with Tommen struggles, BRAN!, Jon or no Jon. 

Oh my god... 9 months. How.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just thought I'd make a post because I'm 30 minutes into PKN and well...

Listening to the guys talk about GoT used to be a highlight of PKA for me.

I was about 200-300 pages short of the end and bang. The single greatest spoiler ever just got dropped on me. It was all fine, oh there was no battle in the show but in the books, oh hey since we're doing spoilers, bang. Day ruined.

I get I'm coming off super ranty but I don't know how else to put it. I'm 100% irrelevant in the hosts lives but damn am I upset. All Woody ever talked about before reading was how great they are for keeping all these secrets. Now whenever the show is brought up he has to drag it into the books. I'm not sure where Kyle stopped reading but at this point should he even bother? Woody clearly knows he's behind but still.. Oh Dany getting on the dragon happened like this instead of this, etc.

I doubt Kyle cares too much but I just need to get this off my chest because I'm pretty sure I feel the same as a lot of people in this matter. 

If you read this Woody, sorry for coming off ranty but please figure out a system for GoT talk. At least for next season now that it's over. Even a banner or hat. Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So from the second this game was announced I was hyped for it and upon release I had it... But on last gen consoles it runs like absolute shit IMO of course. 

The load time between gameplay and the pause menu can reach up to 10-15 seconds. The textures tended to bug out a whole lot and instead of a burnt field or a destroyed tower you're just climbing a grey wall or running across a bumpy black ground. 

So... Is it worth dropping 50 euro knowing those bugs won't happen on digital or will it run the same?

So how does Cloud gaming work? You store the game on their servers for a fee per month or something and then you can stream it to your pc while their systems run it for you? 

What exactly is a provider? I've tried looking up the ones from the wiki page but the Nvidia thing doesn't drop until the 30th and the others seem to be dead ends. 

So am I just too early to use it or am I just so dumb I can't see how easy it is?

I'm guessing the main quest takes me to Bree right? I'm guessing there are a good few quests there for me yes? So I'll be like 20-25 by the time I clear out Bree. So should I drop 500tp for North Downs even though I have no idea where it actually is on the map and I still have the entire Ered Luin area. Or is Ered Luin just somewhere I don't need to go because I started in the Shire and they're equal? Looking on the site it does say North Downs is after Bree so I'm guessing this post was pointless but I'm still looking for some help on how I make sure I level in the right area.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So... Before we start, I'm on ASOS but know about Jon Snow.

He is left on the cliffhanger that he is dead right? But apparently Melisandre is at Castle Black and she'll likely resurrect him or something. I have no idea really. But we are left with the assumption he is dead.

So who does that sit with the fact Kit Harington's contract is up until the end of 2016 and Season 6... 

His contract of course can be renewed for after it (Although this is ASOIAF) but even then, does that mean he's going to be saved in TWOW and go on with something in his plotline? Could the fact that Melisandre is NOT in Castle Black in the show mean they're not going to gut him in this episode? Could they stall it out for another season or so? 

I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on the matter but just remember I'm only a few chapters after the Red Wedding so bringing up other storylines with a spoiler tag would be much appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I just finished Chapter 3 of my first read through of LOTR and Gildor just said to Frodo something like "And may Elbereth watch over you". Sorry if it's a paraphrase but I'm looking for help.

Is it the elvish god? It couldn't be could it? Knowing Eru is god seems kind of universal or is he known as the creator and other's believe in their own gods? 

Also, there was talk of people in the Shire before Hobbits. Were they elves or man? And there was a whisper of life in the Shire after Hobbits. Do we go that far in time or is that just an idea? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So you may have seen me around here lately and it's because I'm getting into the game. 

I subbed yesterday and after hours of downloading then another hour or two of deciding a class, which I finally decided was a Beorning..

But I only have 500 TP, well I got 10 for the first TP quest you get in the town square as the elf start. 

Is there a trick to picking up quick points, do I just have to play out the hunter (because I've found it to be the best solo class) and eventually I'll get enough points to start with a new class. I remember getting the bounty type system way back when but they  were crazy challenges like get a certain 1000 hits with a spell or something. Are they all like that or is there a trick? 

I know people may hate farmers but damnit I'm dying inside knowing if I can't do this I have to wait a few weeks to buy points :/ </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm coming back to this game and I'm trying  to choose a class but I'm really struggling. I played Hunter in WoW and a bit in this so I'm just done with that whole class for now. I took a look at Guardian but I'm not sure how hard it would be to level a tank in solo. Then the two advanced I'm looking at are Beorning and Warden. I tried Lore Master a few months back, got to 15-20 and just got overwhelmed by what I had to which I've recently come to understand I never should have started with that. So is Beorning and Warden just as hard as LM or is that the harder of the three advanced level classes? 

I'm fine with going guardian if you guys believe it's too tricky to start with either of the other 2. I'm gonna sub so I'll also get the 100%xp bonus. But how hard is levelling a Guardian? Does he have any damage before or after choosing a skill tree?

Love some help right now. Thanks. </TEXT>

I thought he was just chilling, stabbed him, ran away for like 2-3 minutes then figured out his attack system. So I got a heide sword or something right? Why can I not equip it? I'm playing knight. Is it something to do with my class or do i need to go further until I talk to someone about weapons and armor?

I can't see myself being a Dodgers fan though. I plan on moving to the US at some point and I'd like to live near the team I choose and LA is near the bottom of the location list for me. 

So how do I choose? It feels cheap to look at the rankings and pick the top. It also seems dumb to choose a team near the bottom just to say I'm not in it for the win because I have no reason to be "in" with any team yet. 

Love some advice right now if you have time. Thanks :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I lived through years of Christmas eve's as a child and this wait does not compare. I sat for 11 hours in one day hitting refresh every few minutes waiting on an email confirming if I got a college interview or not. This does not compare.

Every now and then I wonder what's so great about living in this gamer/nerd bubble/world I live in and today is the answer. I've never felt such excitement and fear at the same time.

Can a 5 year wait really be something we can expect them to live up to? Will it be a completely new version of fallout as F3 was to F2? Could it have Co-op? Should it?! Is there going to be heavy influence on multiplayer or will it be an offline game? 

I'm sitting here writing this now wondering what I can do for 5 hours so I think it's about time I get out of bed and kick on Fallout 3. Lets hope it keeps me sane for now. 

Love to hear your thoughts because the next day of /r/gaming is going to be fucking crazy and I can't wait.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [TV] After 5 seasons of hearing about Winter and how it's coming.. Now that it's here it's actually horrifying. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-02 14:25:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So ever since episode 1 of season 1 we've heard Winter is Coming. They are both Stark words and a true fact. But to me at least those words have kind of been ruined by the sheer amount of "___ is coming" meme's and just the jokes about how it's never actually coming. 

So when Jon was speaking to the elders during S05E08 about how their children will never have children it started to resonate with me. All this talk of the darkest night the world has ever seen or the darkest in centuries. How the darkness will bring only death etc. 

Something about it has always been grim but this episode finally put it into perspective for me and when I hear those rumbles from the cliffs.. I sat in horror/awe as I waited for the charge. Then seeing him raise the dead just shows the type of power we're dealing with.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, let me preface this by saying I'm only on ASOS. I've had something spoiled for me and after this weeks' episode/preview for the next one I need to vent. 

So Jon Snow dies, supposedly, it's not known if he's actually dead or not right? Well, someone told me he was dead but I've come to understand it's kind of left open. 

How the fuck have you guys lasted so long in knowing this?! Season 1 aired around the same time ADWD dropped right? That means you all know he's been set up to die even though you had to watch him grow for a second time (once in book, once on screen) only to know he's going to get betrayed by his honor (Typical "Stark"). 

I just had to vent and I'd love to hear how you feel about it but I'm very touchy in some areas. I've been told Dany rides Drogon (although that's kind of a reach, although somehow likely.). Sam becomes a wizard or something along those lines but when it comes to Jon's 'death' I'd love to hear how you've all lasted this long. I've known for a week he's getting killed off or he's being set up for this season's cliffhanger and I can't handle the notion.  </TEXT>

Is the whole idea of splitting ADWD universal or can I pick up a heavier, complete version somewhere else? 

I'd like to stick to [this style of cover] (https://www.waterstones.com/book/a-game-of-thrones/george-r-r-martin/9780007448036) instead of [this style of cover] (https://www.waterstones.com/book/a-game-of-thrones/george-r-r-martin/9780007548231)

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm thinking about buying it after all this time. But I played Demon Souls way back when and hated it. I felt it was way too clunky or something for the difficulty it had. Maybe it was me, or how  bad I was at games at the time (if I couldn't walk through it after 3-4 times I'd just lose interest, I know, I was horrible).

But after all this time.. It looks pretty good. But I've heard DS 1 basically punished you for doing bad so the longer it took you the harder it got and you got into this never ending pit. Is DS2 like this? 

Also, what's the story like? Is it worth investing in or is it just the gameplay and difficulty that attracts people to it or what?

<TEXT> So I made a post a few hours ago talking about how weak I've felt this season has been. Not even weak, just off, weird, slow, shit is happening but it doesn't feel like it and I guess it's mostly because this season is setting up big stuff for next season or this is a transitional/ filler season. 

But this episode.. It may be on par with the rest of the season and I just don't notice because I woefully want a good episode and I've only slept 4 hours since 10am Saturday (now 6am Monday) so I guess that hope and lack of sleep could have mixed to make me believe this was good. 

But all in all it felt the most Game of Thrones the show has for a while now IMO. It had fighting. It had blood. It had boobs. It had a death. It had a wolf. It had a whitewalker mention. It had a nice cliffhanger and it had a whole lot of snow (it's finally coming guys.) 

(Quick add in: It had the first Dorne scene I've liked so far. Bronn has quite the voice) 
I would do a little attempt at summarizing each characters plot this week but I'm both no good at it and I'm going to try sleep now so just leave your thoughts down below to how you felt about this week's episode and I will either reply within 20 minutes of this post or in a few hours.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I feel as if this season has felt weird in some way(Happy? lol) . I can't put my finger on it but as someone who really doesn't this show to be bad I can't help but feel something is wrong with S5. Maybe it's dorne. Maybe it's King's Landing. Maybe it's the whole merging two massive books into one season deal. It may just be this is my first season that I've regularly checked this sub and seeing all the book reader complaints has fogged my love a bit, I don't know. 

But.. There's so much being built up right now that is about to fucking explode.

With Arya- She's getting towards the end of her training and when she's done I don't see where it's going but I can only expect awesome. (Although the whole faceless man shtick is them changing faces of course which I don't really look forward to because I've become a fan of Maisie.) 

Stannis- He's charging on motherfucking Winterfell with a massive army and I can't see him losing. Although Brienne is still kinda skulking around up there although I doubt she could kill him (I bet the sub would lose their shit because I doubt that's in the books, just seems off.). 

Sansa- She has a whole candle to light and who knows what is gonna happen to Theon. Hopefully he becomes Theon during the battle and fucks shit up.

Jon- I'm not quite sure with Jon. He's off on this savior mission but in the trailer he comes marching off that boat like he's running to battle so... Another battle is a plus I guess. 

Dany- She's about to open the fighting pits and the trailer shows it's gonna be chaos. Let's hope Drogon makes a special appearance and burns those harpies (their called harpies right?)

Tyrion- I just want him to share some good ruling advice and fix her up a bit. 

Jorah- I'm not really sure what's up with him. The Stannis talk did suggest a cure for it and the Red Priest in Volantis (I'm not good with the locations of Essos so I don't know if that's it or not) seemed way too important to only get 2 minutes of screen time.

Cersei- Apart from her being abused by Marg and the Queen of Thorns I'm pretty uninterested in the whole faith of 7 story.. I feel bad for Tommen though. Poor guy just wants to be a gentle king. 

Jaime... The banter between him and Bronn is the only worth while part of Dorne right now. Although now that he is going to Doran I can see something coming of that. Too guys just having a normal chat while that crazy bitch is pushed away(hopefully).

Overall. It kind of turned into a review and I feel I'm forgetting someone but oh well..

TL:DR Battle, battle, bromance, dragon vs harpies, Sansa and Theon stepping up their game, faceless Arya. Hype.

Oh. It could also have something to do with the fact I plan on picking back up ASOS once the season ends so my excitement for that could be a subconscious reason I'm uninterested this season.  

EDIT: I am not speaking for the majority of this sub-reddit of fandom. I only put it that way because most of what I have seen is how it's not as good as other seasons although that is an opinion. This is mine, don't think I'm writing as fact,  if you that's how I come off I'm sorry.  </TEXT>

So recently I heard someone speak about a mod but it's tricky to explain.

When you have a settler, worker, warrior etc. They show up as a group of people right? 5 or 6 little people on the one tile. 

But this mod makes it so instead of 5-6 people it's just 1.

I don't even know if it'll help me run the game better but I plan on trying it out anyway.

If you don't know this mod but do know some mods that make it run better I'd really appreciate it. </TEXT>

It's very nit-picky I know but because they're diverging from the book I'd like to not know what's going on there so when the season ends I'll have a new version of the story to see.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I've always liked called myself a reader but in reality I've read less than 10 books outside of school. 

So I'm changing that BUT I have the worst mindset ever. I judge each book I see by the cover. I can't help it. I look at the art and then I read the back of it. It's horrible I know.

So instead of ignoring something that looks interesting I thought I'd ask you guys. If you've read it I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether it's worth the buy or not. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> This finale broke me inside.. I can't some up the finale but here are some moments I want to share. (SPOILERS) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-20 05:05:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is a post I just made on /r/theflash but I'll post it here seeming this sub is for the show.

So this episode... Well I can't put it into words just yet but here's 3 things that broke me. Well before I start I'll just say the soundtrack to this show does the perfect job at setting a tone. Now here goes.

(Before we start and get emotional I should add in the snap of Killer Frost was fucking awesome and got me extremely hyped for S2)


- When Barry is saying his goodbyes and he looks to Joe and says "goodbye dad" and joe hugs him "goodbye son" paraphrasing I think. 

Joe was willing to give up all those years of having a son for Barry to have a real family. Not knowing what would change for him through it but willing to let it all go..

- When Barry gets to the home, opens the door and the future flash puts his hand out as if to say no, then he closes the door and just takes in all that pain... 

Just.. Something about the way future flash said no really got to me inside. Let it happen Barry. You have done everything in your power to save your mother but please, let her go. This must happen.. 

Now this moment.... I don't know how to describe what happened to me. It wasn't crying. Everything in my body clenching. My hands grabbed my face (i now have a cut under my right eye thanks to my long index fingernail). My jaw dropped, it didn't hang either it was the stiffest I can remember it being. My eyes just leaked and leaked..

- Eddie gave up his life to end Eobard. When I heard the shot I thought typical save the hero by shooting the bad guy but no. Not at all. He felt so insignificant this episode and then found some kind of meaning with Iris which he then sacrificed for the sake of the world. 

At the start of the season I asked for Eddie to get something meaningful to do during each episode because to me at least he was just a backdrop character. He was somewhat on screen but only because of his relation to a main character.

I wish I never asked that. They should have left him back there... Not do that... I went from not caring about him to being emotionally broken inside because of his death.

Thank you CW. Thank you for what you have shared with us over the past year or less. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Mad Max: Fury Road. Worth seeing in 3D if it's IMAX or should I just go 2D? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So 3D movies have been mostly hit and miss but then there's that one spectacle that pulls it off. Gravity. Avatar. That's all I can name really because I never bother with 3D.

But Mad Max is out this Thursday and it's one of the few movies I'd be willing to travel for 50 minutes on a bus to see in IMAX. But it's only available in IMAX +3D. 

I should do it right? Or should I miss out on the imax thing and play it safe with 2D at my local theater?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [All Spoilers] [Theory] Can we talk about a little theory that, at this point is basically set in stone? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-11 15:27:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I put All Spoilers in the title because I don't believe the show has pointed to it truly enough for someone to pick up on it and you need the books to solidify it BUT I'm only on ASOS so anything AFFC, ADWD can you tag please? 

Now... R+L=J . We still call it a theory simply because it's not on paper yet. But we all kind of know its 99% true right?

A Song of Ice (jon) and Fire (Dany).

The episode 4 scene with Baelish in the tombs, giving a very odd look when Sansa said Rhaegar raped Lyanna because it's most likely they loved one another.

The tourney of Harrenhal of course.

The fact that Ned Stark would never truly father a bastard son.

There's a whole lot more of course but last night just pushed it over the edge for me.. That scene with Sam and Aemon talking about Dany. I can't quote it exactly but something like "A lone Targaryen out there." "the last targaryen is alone out there". something like that, then Jon walks in and just stands there..

So at this point, is anyone still questioning it simply because it has "theory" hung above it's head or are you with me in accepting that at some point Jon is going to learn he's a Targaryen. Whether it's true Aemon, he leaves the wall and runs into Dany somehow (although I highly doubt that), or he somehow finds out on his deathbed.

When you're replying just be sure to remember I'm only a few chapters before the red wedding so telling me where jon is ADWD or AFFC would be painful for me. 

Love to hear your thoughts :) </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-05-07 19:16:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So next week Barry, Ollie and Firestorm are facing off vs Wells/Thawne.

But... Oliver has shit to do. In the Arrow promo he's dealing with the league next week and that's a day after Flash. How are they going to pull that plot point out of nowhere? He tells Ra's he needs a few personal days right after his marriage and a load of dead ( not really, we all know they're not but technically the show writers make it seem like they are).. If Arrow was on the day before Flash instead of the day after it might make sense but I can't see how this is going to be done.

<TEXT> So at this point I hate buying games that have been build to run on all 4 consoles because they never seem to run well on 360.

I've heard dragon age inquisition has stupidly long load times and I've spent 60 euro for Shadow of Mordor and played it for about 10 hours before giving up due to graphic glitches and 15 second load times between map and gameplay.

So... Is Farcry 4 the same or will it actually run like a normal game? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So this is gonna sound strange but..

I've always like baseball. I've always wanted to play it. To watch it. To understand the game. But I'm Irish. So I can't just throw on a sports channel and watch it and I hate having to find those virus filled streams and whatnot so I plan on subbing to MLB.TV.

But.. How far into the season is it? Because I've heard baseball is a spring time sport and is over at the start or during summer right? 

Basically what I want to know is how long exactly is there left is the regular season then the whole world series and whatnot. +if there's not that long left, is there a place besides mlb tv where I could find the games?

EDIT: Since I'm now planning on getting it. Normal or Premium? </TEXT>

<TEXT> What happens to the avengers now? 

We see Hawkeye go off to his quiet life which by the way, I absolutely loved how much focus he got this movie. 

Tony drives off into the sunset and that's because his contract is just done with Marvel right? Or at least for Avengers.

Then Bruce took his stealth jet and used it as an escape. 

Thor is going back to deal with his dreams or something and that will most likely be Ragnarok right? 

Then we're left with Cap, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, the guy with  the infinity stone and then the wings guy and war machine/iron patriot. 

Forgive me for not knowing their names but they're the new avengers right? When the Civil War comes about... Wait, they need Tony for that right? But when all these upcoming movies crossover each other will we be getting a lot more scarlet witch than we would before? 

+... This whole thing with Thanos. Isn't that a major plotpoint for the Guardians too? And seeing as Guardians is in the future right? Because Earth is Tera or something. How do they both have the same villain in different timelines? Are they actually not in the same cinematic universe? Like how we got Spidey a year ago but not once was New York's avenger battle mentioned. 

I'd just like some help with everything because I'm going back to see it on Wednesday and I'm really looking to get into the universe and background information. Thanks. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-04-21 14:48:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm a sucker for lore and last Friday I bought The World of Ice and Fire. 

But I'm also reading ASOS and I'm about 5-7 chapters away from the Red Wedding. But I have often gotten moments from the books and show mixed up by reading them parallel too. I was reading ACOK along the time of re-watching the series and that sure messed me over a bit.

So is leaving ASOS until season 5 is done a good idea? I've come to understand that by the end of it it's starting to split from the show and overtake some of the characters story progress but I've also heard this season is just going straight up and moving away from the books. So I would be better off leaving it until the season finishes then getting through the books and knowing where I stand instead of getting storylines, plot-points mixed up etc.? 

+Just had to add in.. The artwork in "The World of.." is absolutely beautiful.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I just got back from Paris and one of the highlights for me was getting to capture the city on a camera but I didn't have one so I got a lend of one from a family member. 

In saying that.. Now that I have all these pictures of the city and attractions, I can't get them on to my pc because I don't have the install disc and I'm 90% sure the family member won't either because he's had the camera a long, long time and needing an installation disc for a pc is a foreign idea to him.

So is there anywhere I can buy another one or some app that I can install to get it done? 

I've tried the software the website gives you but it's just editing software and whatnot. 

I'd really, really appreciate some help in the matter because the camera needs to be returned soon and I can't lose these pics. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I don't know how to preface this other than I couldn't choose a right spoiler tag because I don't know what this falls under but I am only on ASOS and Season 5 right now so I'd like to not be spoiled on anything that's not this topic please?

So I'm new to the whole fan theory thing but I heard about this a while back and never really got it.

So apparently Rhaegar, Dany's brother, had a child with Lyanna Stark after raping her before his timely death.

Then Lyanna speaks to Ned about something that is never spoke out loud and only Ned knows and has to keep a promise.

Then the honorable Ned Stark, the man who dies without questioning his honor, beds another woman. (supposedly of course.)

Ned shows up with a son and a dead sister who was raped before her death and has one promise+secret to keep.

Then at no point ever says the name of the woman he slept with. 

Even though it's not written on paper.. It's pretty set in stone that Jon Snow is in fact Jon Strark/Targaryen right?

And if so. He is then the nephew of Dany? Which if they are both in fact alive in the later books could somehow end up meeting? He stands valiantly at the wall as always defending it from all sorts. Winter comes. Dany shows up all Dragonriding and shit to save the wall from destruction as Stannis did.

Which could in some cases lead to a romance without them knowing or even if they knew (somehow?) because Targaryen's kept it in the family right?

Although. Wouldn't the fact Jon got burned fighting the walker in ACOK(?) make him not-so fire proof? Although I've heard talk that Dany herself is not 100% immune to fire and had some kind of special occasion thing?

I know some of this is poorly written (most of it really.) but I had to get it off my chest and discuss it.

And once again. Please, I understand it says SPOILERS ALL but if Jon is dead already, please don't tell me. Just leave the post with no replies. Thank you. *I'm on Season 5 and starting ASOS: Blood and Gold.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> So over the last few years I've really come to love a good lovestory or on screen romance with strong chemistry.

You know. Jon and Ygritte. Andy and April. Ted and Robin. Leslie and Ben.

There are a few others from shows but I don't remember the characters name but.

One tree hill. Lucas and the blonde. Then Lucas and Sophia Bush's character. Then anything about Sophia finding someone. 

Oliver and Felicity. Oliver and Laurel. Barry and Iris. 

Emily and her long time guy friend from Revenge. The ex cop, boat owner guy.

So is there any other shows out there that have a strong love arc that isn't just there because the higher ups want it to have a lovestory.

I really should have asked for show names with the couples... Never have I seen more names without context in my life. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I knew Daredevil was going for a darker approach to Marvel but damn this is fucking dark. Episodes 1-4 spoilers only! (Ps. it turns into an early review towards the end.) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-11 03:59:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm 4 episodes in (starting the 5th) and I'm loving this show..

When you think DC you think gritty, dark and a bass heavy soundtrack.

When you think Marvel you think fun, family friendly and an epic soundtrack. .. Actually, I don't think of the soundtrack when I think of Marvel so I guess I need to revisit those movies (apart from Guardians of course.)

So when it came to Daredevil being a dark show I just thought they'd show some blood and violence... This motherfucker just spent a solid 15-20 seconds on screen slamming a mans skull with a car door until it splattered and dropped from the side.

Then the bowling scene when he broke that arm.

I made this post revolving around the violence but I just had to say I love this show so far. I haven't heard of the Matt actor before this but I'll be looking for his work when I'm done. I don't know of Floggy (they don't say his name much, that's it right?) but he's doing a fine job of being comedic relief. I'm not sure what they're doing with Deborah Ann Woll's character just yet. I thought she'd be constantly around the guys and playing the early seasons Laurel role from Arrow. You know, knowing the guys but just being there for dialogue and the occasional fetch quest. But she's turning out to have her entire own story which is interesting. Then Clare. She seems to be setting up for a romantic role but I'm not sure exactly because I'm new to DD but I also don't want to know. I'd just like to see more Floggy. The show is doing a damn fine job of making every character feel important. We get Matt being Matt. Matt being DD. Deborah's character on her quest for justice through journalism and detective work. You even have the backstory to that guy she's working with, how he has the woman in the hospital (although it's very brief.). We then see a lot of the villains in work.

+That joke about him having an iron suit or magic hammer... Golden.

Love to hear your thoughts on the series up this far but please don't go past 4. I can't have this series ruined for me like House of Cards. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I just finished episode one of the Netflix series and I'm really, really impressed but I knew I would be because I both love comic shows and Netflix shows.

So that aside. What exactly makes him a superhero? 

From what I understand he was trained to fight and has hearing beyond measure and I guess is some version of sonar? But what else is there? I learned that he can tell if someone is lying by the pace of the heart which is fucking awesome btw. 

Is there anything else? I know there most likely is but what is it?

Also, it seems to me that rain to daredevil is like the earth to superman. It's their chosen place to fight. At least I think so? right? Having the constant water pouring down on to the surrounding objects for his mind to map out.

Then I have to ask, I don't know the villain of the show yet except he's not allowed to be named by his workers but apart from this guy. How many villains can there be? Like I guess he's going to fight this villain throughout season 1 and beat him at the end (which I don't want to know if he does or not). So if they follow that formula, how many plausible seasons can there be? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I am pretty new to the Witcher series. I read some of the story for 1 and played about 8 hours of 2. I understand that is nothing but I need a strong reason to turn on my 360 instead of my pc.

So in saying that I've been doing my best to keep up with Witcher 3 as I process through 2. 

They announced that to complete the entire game it would take 200+ hours. A 60 dollar game with 200+ hours of base content sounds like a dream right?

Then they announced the DLC packs that open up an entire new area of the world and some gripping story. The first one should take about 10 hours. The second pack will then include 20 hours of content and entire new area of the map because (I'm paraphrasing) "when getting new content for a game we, as gamers want it to mean something to the story".

Now don't get me wrong, it could still turn out to be Unity upon release but I doubt it.

Love to hear your thoughts on the matter.

EDIT: I found the quotes.

-With the development of Wild Hunt coming to an end, the team has embarked upon the creation of two new really big adventures set in The Witcher universe, 

We remember the time when add-on disks truly expanded games by delivering meaningful content. As gamers, wed like to bring that back. Weve said in the past that if we ever decide to release paid content, it will be vast in size and represent real value for the money. Both our expansions offer more hours of gameplay than quite a few standalone games out there.  </TEXT>

It's not at all like that. One man who wrote a lot tried to evade taxes and in doing so has created one of the most well known and hated cults of all time. That's what it is. It's a cult, not a religion.

The shit they tell us about in that doc... The baby facility... The daughter who disconnected from her mother... It's all just fucking disgusting. 

They are a non-profit religion and have racked up billions of dollars... How does this happen? What has to happen for the IRS to somehow revoke those tax rights and make it officially a cult or anything but a religion?

It's just... Fuck Scientology.

<TITLE> TIFU by ordering games from G2A. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-03 03:48:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So this actually goes back a couple months.

I started ordering games off G2A a few months back when I seen a youtuber pick it up and advertise it. It seemed easy enough. They seemed secure. It was cheap. Where was the wrong in this?

Well... About a week ago I went to order something online, my card got declined. I knew the money was on the card so I was wondering what could be wrong. I went the bank machine. It showed the money but wouldn't allow me to take it. I then went to the post office and they would let me take it so I just thought card flaw.

Then today I got paid again, tried it and it still failed so I called my bank..

The second I got on to someone and told them I need a new card they stopped me "sir we need you to confirm a few payments or transactions you might since the 12th of March. 

I expected nothing of it. The first 15 or so transactions were me.. Then she said something that wasn't. I don't know what it was but it was for like 12 dollars (and I'm in Ireland. We're Euro here.) [oh and Ps. everything got declined so I'm fine, kind of?]

Then she kept going.. There were honestly a good 30-40 attempts at my card all in the US and it ranged from 3 dollars at Bestbuy to 2000 dollars on American Airway or whatever the airline is. I wrote it down as she called it out.. If the transactions went through and I had the type of money they spent. I'd have lost upwards of 12-13 thousand. 

I get paid 160 euro a week. I can't quite imagine losing this amount of cash so to anyone out there looking to buy games. No matter what you see that points you towards it or whoever tells you it's fine. IT'S NOT. 

Stick to Steam, Xbox, PSN, Origin, whatever your base game store is. Just don't buy from these. 

And for anyone wondering why I blame them. I don't use my card often. I use it in my local store for shopping. My xbox live sub and the occasional game on sale. I haven't bought a game off Steam or Origin in about a year and even then, could I blame them? Then Riot. 

So I may be naive in thinking those legit companies are giving away my bank details but when you put the names in a list G2A come last. 

Fuck you g2a. </TEXT>

Jurassic Park had a truly awful 2nd or 3rd right?

Maybe... Just maybe... You could say the original Star Wars (4-6 that is). But I've never been a big fan and even then, were they as well rounded and epic as LOTR? Maybe I could put them as equals I guess. 

I need some opinions. I'm not too well versed on Star Wars and I'm pretty biased with anything LOTR so I'd honestly love to here your argument for any trilogy really. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So after 2 years of release (I think?) I finally decided to sit down and watch this movie. I've had the intention to do it but tonight I felt down even though I just got a loan of my grandad's camera (canon eos 400d for anyone who knows cameras. i don't..).

So I knew this movie was supposedly great to look at.. And by god what an understatement that is. At first its kind of odd how he jumped through the building and whatever but once you get adjusted to his little daydreams it becomes fun to watch (that fight scene over Mr Stretch). 

But... I'm honestly trying to come with words but I can't.

If you haven't seen it, please do. It's just breathtaking. Interesting story, pretty great Ben Stiller performance, very interesting take on a love story, Sean Penn is pretty hilarious and touching for what? 5-10 minutes of screen time. The soundtrack was quite fitting too. Loved it. 

All in all... On my messed up version of a 1-10 system I'd give this a solid 8.5 or 9.

<TEXT> So apart from the first week of heists my favorite thing to do is race. I love it. Buut.... I've ran each one like 15+ times. I've added in custom races from the social club but I still keep getting the rockstar designed picks or that fucking Obstacle What race.

So is there a way I can choose what NOT to search instead of adding in what to search? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I played both a while back and enjoyed both but I'm not sure which I preferred.

As someone who has never played much Halo I have to ask you guys. Which one is more populated? What has the bigger variety in terms of weapons, customization, maps.

I should add in I've played the 4's story but not Reach's although i know how it ends.... 

TIL: Asking for help in deciding between 2 Halo's somehow makes its way to keep your money for an xbox one and mcc.

I have 15 bucks and no interest in saving for a one.. I just need help choosing a game.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I watched Interstellar on my monitor a few nights back and as odd as it is to watch it on a monitor after seeing it twice in cinema I enjoyed it. 

But because my cinema doesn't do IMAX I didn't get, or at least I didn't notice any aspect ratio changes. Now I have sadly never witnessed IMAX so I don't even know if it would change for that but I guess it would because it did on the version I watched a few days back.. 

And it was a a joy to watch. How it went from normal version with Cooper talking to Murph and then as he leaves it pans into fullscreen.. It was quite gorgeous for lack of a better word.

So after rambling about nothing interesting for a few moments I'm basically asking if there are any other movies that do it to such a degree? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I enjoy F2P games but.. I love a game that gives me an option to buy what I choose and not over do it like most Cod's, Ea games and a lot of other F2P games.

So VIP.. Right now I'm not in the best spot for money so getting something like Moria, Rohan, any of the other expansions is a no go.

And I should add in, I am pretty new to the game. I had a 13 hunter but got bored of it because I main hunter on WoW but now I'm trying both Lore Keeper and Burglar although I haven't looked into the classes VIP unlock.

So it's been about a day or so since I've read exactly what I get but I know about the 100xp boost, no gold cap, 500TP a month and all the classes/races. So what expansions do I get exactly? Would I get Rohan for as long as I am subbed or are there only certain dlc's?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I have been reading the books for the first time but when I'm not reading it I'm watching the show, but slow enough so the show doesn't pass the books of course.

So in the show towards the end of season 2 Robb finds Tulisa (that's her name right?) and they get married and everything by early season 3. 

In the books however. Robb just shows up about 150 pages in and introduces Cat to Jeynne Westerling. 

Is this the first time we meet the character in the book or has the show blurred out a past mention of her? 

Also.. Within the introduction to her I'm already more fond of her than I was of Tulisa just because I never really thought of her as a queen and because we met no family she seemed uninteresting in some way but I'm a fan of Jeynne so far..

As much as you can be for an oathbreaking marriage..  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> You know.. You can say what you want about the series. How it went from a cliche car racing movie to an action movie to an over the top extreme action flick..

But I grew up with this series. This is the one movie that me and my mom would go to see on the day it released and as unrealistic as it was, I was able to lose myself in it for 2 hours.

But.. Now with Paul sadly gone. I really don't want to watch the new one. I will of course book tickets for it on release day, the first viewing of it and most likely see it multiple times in the cinema. But.. As good or bad as it's going to be there is going to be a scene in the movie when they say goodbye to Paul... Writing this now I'm crying because I simply find it hard to believe. I never wrote about it when he died because I was in denial. Lately his name has become the front of car jokes and shit and I've let his importance in my life slip but the movies he made were the only connection I had with my mom and still is. 

I don't know why I wrote  this other than to hear other people's thoughts on the matter. Will you be going to see it as either a fan of the series or just to see how it goes? Did his death hit you hard or are you someone who doesn't get affected by celebrity deaths? 

Just leave your thoughts below and I'll get back to you when I'm back from the store.

<TEXT> So about a year ago I played the lightning returns demo (or whenever it came out) and I absolutely loved it. But because it's the third in a three part series I went back and bought xiii. But I really couldn't get into it. I don't know what it was but.. I couldn't get into xiii yet I could play LR's demo 3-4 times a day. Maybe it's the turn based gameplay or something but.. I just couldn't get into xiii.

In saying that. Is there any way I could play LR without having finished xiii 1+2? Could I just look up summaries or endings to both of them and move on or even just go straight into LR because I've heard they mention the past in a easy to follow way and I already know the blonde guy at some point goes to the 'dark side'.

Love to hear your advice on the matter. Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I am genuinely the worst kind of book reader out there in the fact that I judge a book by it's cover and only read something that I know the story of simply because it became a show or movie, which then actually makes it harder for me to enjoy it because I know the plot. Trust me, I know how horrible I am.

In saying that. I bought this book about 2 years ago and when I got home, I sat in in my collection of read and unread books (I have maybe 10 books..Sorry.).

So now that I'm looking to start actually reading like the rest of you, is it good? I have a horrible fear that I'll read it and it will be awful but I don't know it because I'm inexperienced in the topic. 

Forgive how ignorant I am and how I judge a book by it's cover, how I only read something that becomes mainstream but I'm trying to change that.

Thanks :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I just watched it for the first time and like every other Tarantino movie, it was just his style and beautiful.

But the highlight for me (apart from Christoph Waltz being the masterpiece he is) was Brad Pitt.

He was just so nonchalant about every in regards to killing Nazis. His thick, thick southern accent and then my highlight of the movie..  His Italian accent. Pretty certain he literally says bonjurno with a deeper tone to his voice and that's it. 

Hell of a movie though. The only problem I had with it was the noticeably fake leg after the actress got shot.

9/10 for me.

<TITLE> Focus is a pretty solid movie. (Spoilers) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-16 02:59:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I just wrapped up Focus with Will Smith and Margot Robbie.

I had a little bit of interest before release of this movie and decided I'm going to lay down and watch it. 

It was a great choice to do that. This is of course, an opinion, and an opinion of a 18 year old who gets too deep into a movie and usually misjudges something or ignores plot holes.

So.. trying to write this I can only summarize the movie when trying to give a real review so I'll just point out my favorite parts and flaws.

So at the football game. Right before it, when they get all the cash, you hear the guy he runs with tell him not to gamble. Whatever he does, don't gamble. Then you see him playing around with Margot, making little bets about the crowd which is fun, then the asian guy jumps in, who I quite frankly enjoyed. But anyway, once he starts gambling and you get these shots of his face, how he's feeling, his thought pattern run through his face.. I honestly concerned. I expected the 1mil to be lost and then throughout the movie he'd run "that one big job" Margot dreamed of. But that doesn't happen because like the other twists in this movie, it was all planned. Margot spots him, I can't think of his characters name, or the actor, but the heavy guy. That's when she notices and Will proceeds to explain it all to her.

Then after that is my first flaw. I found Margots facial expression when he left her in the car.. It was kind of over acted from how I seen it. I understand they meant something to eachother and whatever but how her entire face goes into a sign of shock and paralyzing pain.. I felt it to be over acted but am most likely wrong.

Then when they found eachother later in the movie I thought at times they meant somehting to eachother, then they were playing eachother.. Then he tricks the "villain" of the movie into his exr(?) and makes 27million. I expected them to be caught of course.. But.. 

When he opened up about using her I felt sad, like really sad.. It shows everyone can be played, it was all just a performance and it makes you realize what you're actually watching is all one big performance and none of it is real because he is in fact married and a multi millionaire with kids.. 

When he got shot, that caught me off guard and then once I heard "Mellow" I realized who the bald guy was (I can't think of his name for the life of me but I know his face quite well). The emotional story in the car was a nice add on, I found him hilarious when he just left with all the cash and that is that.

Overall, I really enjoyed it but write really poor reviews and hopefully one day I will make sense but until then readers can suffer through my naivety and inexperience.

Love to hear your thoughts on it.  8/10 </TEXT>

<TITLE> [No Spoilers] Would I be crazy to pause my reading of ASOIAF to pick up The World of ice and fire? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-12 23:49:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I finished ACOK a week or 2 ago and I picked up ASOS. Now I understand ASOS is the best in the series, or at least most action packed. So would I be crazy to start reading that, as I pack and prepare for a trip to Paris and while I'm moving house. (so a lot of stress basically and chaos).

Or would I be better off just picking up "The World" until the chaos is over. And take in I'm fascinated by the old Targaryens, beyond the wall, the battle for kings landing etc. Although I've heard it's not that great because Martin was only a co-author...?

To be honest.. I'm just looking for some fan reviews of The World of Ice and Fire because I feel starting up ASOS in the chaos right now instead of leaving it for when I'm settled back in and have the time to indulge it, is madness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So when I play GTA online it's just to run races and waste time...

But now with heists out. It's all I do. 

I went from stealing a prison bus, to blasting my way out of prison, to parachuting into Humane Labs with night vision and swimming through an underwater tunnel to a pick up spot where I had to shoot up flares to signal my location.

It just has such an epic feel to it. It's hard to explain but the first time you run a heist and it goes well... It's such a great feeling (even if I am only getting 10-15%).

I just thought, with all the chaos of people screaming about server problems that I'd share how I feel about the content itself and by god I couldn't be happier.

Thank you Rockstar. Once again you managed to live up to the hype. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm watching The Theory of Everything for the second time and it has me thinking. 

I like to believe I read, but I really don't. 

I like to believe I understand certain aspects of science and go further than just reading an article, which I don't.

So now I plan on picking up one of the two books in the title. But how do they read? Is it all just equations, how this came to be that, if this happens then that happens because of it. 

Or is it an easy book to pick up and is written in such a way that anyone really, could read it?

If you have read either of them I'd love to hear your thoughts on them as I should be buying one within the next 16 hours so I'd like to know what I'm getting into. OR if there is a different book completely that does a good job of opening up my knowledge base and just dropping a block of science into. 

Forgive that last analogy/metaphor... It's 2am and I haven't slept in more than 3 hours a night in 3 days. 

Just leave your replies here and I should get back to them in about 6 hours. Thanks :) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So lets face it. Just about every franchise out there has an mmo right now. Lotr, Star Trek, Star wars, etc.

But... Can we just imagine  a GOT mmo for a moment? The world that we all know and love comes to life even more than it already is. 

I've thought out a few pieces. For starts, you'd choose your sex. then where you are from in the world, choose to be a northerner, southern, bravos etc. Then choose the house you represent. Then your class. Then off you go.

For each choice, like most mmo's, your starting choices will have effects.

For example: If you were to be from the north you could have cold resistance.

If you were to be represent the Lannisters you get extra starting gold, a higher cap or a bigger inventory.

Dothraki could have +fire damage or fire resistance. 

Greyjoys could have something water related. Hold breath for longer or ship combat could be a thing which they excel at.

Starks of course, if they choose a hunter could have a direwolf as a pet. 

Stannis could of course have a god mode with zero cooldown. 

This is just an idea I thought up while making pizza so it could be an awful idea but I'd genuinely love this. It of course would takes years and because of it, it could be in the works already. I just hope if/when this idea comes around it is someone who cares about the world at the helm of it.

Love to hear your thoughts on this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I tried this a few days back with an account I already had and it wasn't working so I expected the problem to be the fact it's an account already registered in game.

So I went ahead and clicked a referral link while logged out of the website. It looked like it was all going well. I clicked the link, it sent me to the registry page, I registered, made my password and everything and finished at the download window. 

But then when I logged into the game... It didn't work? I don't really know what I get for being a sub yet exactly but right now I literally want it for a race. I don't know the name but I want to be the blind guys with cloth over their eyes. Call it what you will, it's a high preference for me just because I like the look of it. 

Do I just get the extra xp buff and use of chat with the 7 day trial or should it have given me all advantages of subbing. If so it didn't work because once I tried to make my char I had no race options. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is there a reason WoD dungeon queues take a ridiculous amount of time? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-08 02:03:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I have just left this problem alone for a while now and accepted it but now I just have to rant for a second.

First off. The lack of dungeons for level 90-100 in my opinion is quite, quite bad. It's what? 6-7 dungeons for 10 levels? Now I understand the fact the quests and story is pretty great and has a certain epic feeling to it (the soundtrack helps) but there are so few dungeons and the ones I've played (up to Skyreach) really aren't that great IMO.

Now. Why the F am I waiting 20-40 minutes for a dungeon? I was once told it took so long at low levels because there weren't many people doing them. They took 15 minutes at most. I am waiting almost twice that time for a level 97-100 dungeon. Is there an official reason for this? Has Blizz gave a word on the matter? It's not a matter of boredom. I am questing between dungeons but that isn't a reason to take so long. The grind to get 100 is killing me inside simply because I feel all I do is wait, run, kill a bullet sponge and then have to wait another 30 minutes. 

All in all, this is just an opinion so I'd like to hear yours. </TEXT>

You got to see the faces slowly take in the effects of the drinks. 

I don't really know what to see other than this is probably, at least in my opinion, on par if not better than the show with Wolf.. It's a bold statement I know but t'is an opinion.

So I just finished watching it and before we go any further just know I tend to avoid watching animated movies. I don't know why but I just never took interest in them until my brother was watching it yesterday and the part I seen gave me a giggle. 

But then I started watching it and it was quite fun.. Until his brother dies. I was not expecting that shit. Like.. They just killed off his fucking brother. 

Baymax(?) is so fun to watch on screen. Everything from when he first pops up in the bedroom and awkwardly makes his way over to Hiro and then to the moment he sacrifices himself for them and does so in such a human way... I cried.. Like really, really cried watching that. I don't really know what I'm trying to say other than how fun it was to watch. This is a poorly written rant and I'm sorry about that but damn I enjoyed that.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So we know the show is finishing before the book and we know Martin gave D D the ending and some of the key plot points but not everything. Knowing this I've come to think about how it could go. 

Because we have the whole Bran and the Children thing going on, magic and what not. Throwing fireballs if I remember. Then you have the whole white walker situation, the dragons.

I don't know any of the story outside the show and the first two books but is there some way we could see Bran controlling dragons to destroy the whitewalkers? Because like... They're kinda hard to kill. They need to be burnt to stay dead and Bran is north of the wall already so we'd need to understand why exactly the dragons end up above the wall. WHICH I HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT. 

Before we go there I just have to say.. If this show is going towards an epic finish, everyone uniting, everyone dying, white walker battles, dragons everywhere, dragons eventually reaching Kings Landing (hopefully).... They are really going to have a high, high budget. 
This is ahead of the show or even in the show without you knowing about it but it's a theory I have so don't read if you want to figure it out on your own. (It's in relation to Jon Snow's mother.)

[] (#s "So Jon Snow has no mom yet in the books right? And well. I can't exactly remember how I came to the conclusion but I after connecting Robert to Lyanna, then Lyanna had a connection to the Targaryen's right? Rhaegar I think? Then 'A song of Ice and Fire' so.. Am I right, at least in the ball park of thinking Jon Snow is somehow related to Dany? Now I understand it's all just theories right now but after enough evidence can you figure it out? I've heard there are forums everywhere but I'm afraid to go there. Spoilers and all.") 

I just realized I made this post to talk about the differences the show could have to the book and ended up just ranting on about something else. 

I just meant.. The show could go full hollywood and do everything I've said and then the books could come out, and be really relaxed (as relaxed as Martin can write). So I am honestly happy they're going to be finishing first, it gives them room to work around the story, although I've heard they're already doing that pretty well.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-02-28 19:02:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I understand that the fighting and gameplay is going to be basic MMO stuff but how is the story and world you play in? 

I played WoW for a bit and i didn't even bother reading the quests after a while because it was just run, collect, kill, repeat.

How are the quests in this game?

 How does the world itself feel and how does that work? Is there a teleport-taxi type system for travelling between planets or do you own a ship you fly. 

Is there ship combat? 

What is the max level and what is late game like? In WoW you had raids and farming for gear. Is it the same in this game? 

I am just really interested in this because I am 18, so for me Episode 1-3 were my originals, which is probably why i never loved the series as others do. But I really hope to go back and watch the movies, read up on it or whatever so I'm ready for episode 7 because watching the cinematic really reminded me of the potential this series. The sheer force of the jedi's. The soundtrack. The epic battles and quest for good vs evil. I just have to know if you feel any of that in this game or if it makes you actually feel like you're important.

Thanks.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> So I just finished Season 3 and thought I'd share how I feel. SPOILERS FOR ALL 13 EPISODES! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-28 04:03:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So before I start I have to add in something. I tend to rant a bit about things that don't matter and reading it may be hard because I ramble a lot but I'll do my best to stay on track. 

Right now it's 2:30 am. Season 3 released at 8am for me yesterday morning and I couldn't sleep last night and instead of waking up around 2-3 pm I said fuck it and stayed awake through the night just to get a good start for the season. 

The first episode had a pretty memorable moment to me. He just straight up pissed on his dad's grave. Then the rest of the episode followed the life of Doug and showed glimpes of Frank on tv and in meeting. It really did a good job at making me feel bad for Doug. How he lost everything just because he had some creepy love for a girl. How he just desperately wanted to work with Frank again and literally, by the looks of it, broke his arm, put a wooden spoon under it then wrapped it up and used the damn spoon as a brace replacement so to speak and that made me just question how I've always felt about Doug. 

The next 'great moment' I remember is the debate/interview between Frank, Sharp and Dunbar. I loved this entire scene. It was just so straight forward and 'this is politics'. How Sharp, before the scene, tried to make a deal with Dunbar but she declined so Sharp went right ahead and accused Dunbar of being sexist and being a shitty parent. Then out of no where, Frank drops the bomb on Sharp (who was basically winning the debate for him, without him ever having to speak out too much) and tells everyone her kids are in private school too. 

Then the whole Remy and Sharp + Tony (? The writer) and the other writer.. The 2 little love plots.. I would like to think they hold a big place in the story, backstabbing and scandals or w/e but I just felt they were a bit unnecessary or at least got more screen time than they needed. +The Remy and Sharp scene, when he's walking out and turns back for them to kiss.. I've never felt so pushed out of a show in my life. It was just brutally predictable, forced and was just a poor, poor scene in my opinion. 

After that we the whole Petrov thing. You know... Writing this, I'm trying to think of scenes, characters and stuff. I completely forgot about Petrov for some reason but.. I really enjoyed watching him on screen. How he just said fuck it and kissed Claire at the start and then set up his own troops to die just so plays could be made. (+when he showed off his scars.. Total badass russian moment) 

You have the whole Claire on the UN thing. How she was pusing out Durant (if that's her name?) then makes a deal out of them being equals. They have a few drinks and that whole deal is forgotten about and I can't remember seeing her on screen after that. 

Doug and Rachel/Cassie. It was incredibly uninteresting imo. I'm sure we were meant to feel for Doug and the choice he had to make but.... I just didn't. Once he got info she was back he went back to being creepy/ psycho Doug for her, which I enjoy to watch but that final scene could have been done a bit more. It was just emotionless or something.

Then I have to give a few mentions to EVERY TIME FRANK LOST HIS SHIT. He needed to do it more. In 13 episodes he probably 'snapped' 4 or 5 times.  

Then the final scene.. Going into this season and seeing Claire get sick I was expecting a bad illness or ever for her to die  so I paid attention to that and after a while I really just accepted the fact they will either be mourning her at the end of the season or she's leaving. Which she did.

That scene about him taking control. not the sex one, oh btw, I still don't understand exactly why she did that. I'm talking about the final 'big' scene. When they're in the office, she says he is what's missing and he grabs her by the jaw and starts to lose his shit but doesn't lose it too much (sadly) and he takes control of that scene which I loved. Then she just comes out in a later scene and leaves him. I grinned at that but that was it.

Now this is the hard part... I don't remember much after that. I understand binge watching a show just mashes it all together but I found myself enjoying the show. Though.... Not as much as I had enjoyed the first and second season. I don't know what was missing. I just didn't feel any threat this season, at all. We had the abortion note scare but that was instantly dealt with when he gave Doug a job. 

Like in season 1 he had constant shit on his plate that could straight up ruin his career and cripple everything. Kate Mara's character was constantly mixing up shit. The Russo guy who they killed off. Once Kate's character became unnecessary and a pain he pushed her out in front of a fucking train. THAT RUINED ME. Claire had the whole sex scandal deal, then the rape plot. How we found it Frank had that thing going on with an old friend at the reunion, which was also a fun as hell episode to watch. 

I just don't have words for it. 

24 hours ago I was literally deciding to stay awake so I can get to House of Cards the second it releases... I loved it for the opening hour or so then it just became another show that had a stand out moments and nothing else. I understand that a lot happened and they moved by some serious plot but it really doesn't feel like they did. 

I'm sad to say it but after waiting so long for it to release and all the excitement I had for it.. It didn't live up to it. 

SURE. Maybe I am horribly wrong in  this and binge watching it was the worst choice I could make but I will be going back to watch it and this time I'm going to do an episode a week and do my best to get better at reviewing it. Who knows, maybe actually get good at sharing how I feel and putting aside my bias hype or distaste for certain parts of the show.

If you made it through the reading I'd love to hear your thoughts on the season. Out of 10... I'd give it 8 or 8.5.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> How exactly does PTR work? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-28 00:11:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I like to think I know the basics to D3. I have about 150 hours or so (completely guessing). And yes, I understand typical d3 players are laughing at my time right now but lets leave that behind before I rant on for no reason.

So I'm letting PTR install and I just have a few questions. First off, why is it a completely new install? Couldn't it just be a patch type deal? How do characters work in terms of crossing over? Can I pick up my season 2 monk from my normal account to the PTR? Does the gear I find it PTR drag across or must I keep that in PTR until the patch comes out, then I can drag across, if tghat makes sense? Then the final thing is a kinda odd question. Is there a 2000% legendary drop on PTR right now or was the title of the stream I watched just stating a stat he had on gear or a bug he found with gear?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So like it says in the title, no spoilers here but this is just something I realized. 

You guys have been waiting on this book for years now right? and it's still a year or 2 away... This book is  hopefully going to be around 900-1000 pages. Depending on how fast you read, that book can last you a few days or a few weeks. But then it's done with and you are going to have to wait another few years (hopefully not as long).

With knowing this I have to ask how you guys will deal with it. Will you pick it up and read through the last book again before reading it. Binge read and just consume it over a week (if you even could?) or will you steady it out, savoring it by doing maybe a chapter a day, 2 day, 100 pages a week maybe?.. I don't know, I've never been that into a series to be big on it's launch date and seeing as I'm 300 pages into ACOK I'm going to be waiting for WoW with the rest of you although I have no plan for it. I guess I'd like to steady it out but lets be honest.. It's kinda hard to put this book down once you start.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I played the beta, loved it. Picked the game up just before the first expansion dropped and enjoyed it BUT.. I was that little bit late to the game, so it made finding a group to learn with was pretty hard and.. I don't exactly understand light levels and how to farm for gear in this game.
So here I am, 8 months(?) after release and just want to know. If I pick up the game again is there a place I can go to find out how to farm for a weapon, get light gear or w/e, how to get a high enough gear for raids (if that's even a thing, I just played a bit of wow a few months back and you needed a high gear level to raid). +Being late to raids is usually a horrible thing. If I got into vault of glass or whatever it's called (forgive my ignorance) I would have nooooo idea what to do. I seen some clips and someone had a shield, there was a fog type deal going on, then just a never dying boss.
Also, if you're on xbox 360 and looking to play but be patient enough to help me (on skype [typing or speaking], I don't have a headset for xbox) just let me know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that will be the one and only time in my life that I watch that movie.
It's the single most sad yet happy yet brutally angering movie I've ever watched.

There were moments of just out right crying, covering my mouth as the tears rolled down my eyes. Then there were moments of happiness. When you see him walking, how he looked like his dad.... Even now writing this I'm crying again.

As for anger.. I can't put it into words. I'm not even going to speak of her other than the idea that one day people forget her name and she's lost in time.

I genuinely don't understand how Kate and David did it. How even after losing a son the kept going. They fought the battles they needed for that baby. Then they lost the baby... I don't think I'd ever have made it that far. Now to learn they didn't stop there and kept going to change the bullshit system that let it all happen. I just....

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I honestly don't know what to say. I caught up just in time for the finale apparently so that's a thing.. 

So a few thoughts. 

It's probably the best cast show on Tv. I didn't know much about the show going into it apart from Chris Pratt and the few words around Reddit about Amy Poehler (I seen that one speech about her being 'blonde tina fey') and that's about it.

So where do I start? I found it impossible to pick a favorite character. They all have their own traits. 

Leslie was... Well, she's Leslie.

Ann was a great character and I loved her with Leslie but when she left I didn't feel a massive loss.

Andy. He was perfectly dumb and goofy without being over the top. Some of his one liners were just incredible (I'm going to be saying that a lot I expect).

April. You know.. I knew her face going into this and didn't expect to be a big fan of her. I was wrong.. When she was trying to get with Andy in the early seasons, they were probably some of my favorite scenes (I'm a sucker for cute romance and some aww moments). +Some of her satanic, hate filled one liners were pretty good and how she only really had a few touching moments in the show made it better.

Ben. I love Ben. I knew the actors face going into the show and really quite honestly expected to hate him. But then his witty accountant humor and his nerd moments were great. Specifically the Batman costume and then the Iron Throne(although Leslie made that scene).

Chris T. I'm not going to lie.. It took me a while to get around to liking this guy. His constant happiness, upbeat attitude and everything, I found it odd and off putting. But then I got used to it and boy I love it. "that is literally"... He's great. 

Gerry, Jerry, Larry, Terry. He is probably the best butt of a joke I've ever seen. Everything from him finding out he was adopted to being the mayor of Pawnee. How he got that wife. How easy his life is at home and he came out of retirement for them and he still never got a word in, no matter the idea he had. 

Tom. Tom is right there with Ann for me. He never left the show, but if he did.... I wouldn't have missed him that much. He is fun and his ideas/patents were a good giggle but I found that to be it.

Donna. Donna was fun I guess. She was always around and everything but did have a few moments. How she had a fiance in Denver or something and all these other out of work things going on. 

Before I get on to Ron... I have to give an honorable mention to those f*cking twins. From the second the guy got on screen to the last time either of them are shown.. I hated them deeply. They were perfect. 

Oh. And Mark. He was pretty good I guess. I don't remember many great Mark moments. 

Now... Ron Motherfucking Swanson. Yup. I just realized who my favorite is. That is all. 

So.. After listing everything I'm thinking about the characters I don't know what else to say. This show has given me, by far, the most bursts of laughter. I want to do an 'everything from this to this' but I'm blanking painfully hard and lets be serious, there are way too many of them to choose from(although not right now).

One thing I do have to say though... Season 7 really didn't do it for me. I don't know what it was. It was just 'off' somehow. Maybe it's just because they didn't all share the office, because it wasn't a typical group deal. How they are all moving apart slowly, which is how it should end I know but it's not that great. I have to admit I cried when Ron told Leslie he went to ask for that job. How he was a rock the entire series and then he felt alone and had to deal with it on his own until they got locked in that office. 

This is a really long rant that is a mess but I'll post anyway. Love to hear your thoughts on the show.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've recently got into the Green Arrow comics (on the 4th of Year One) and I've noticed a few difference from the TV show. How his dad was on the boat and the entire thing was set up for him to die. +Sarah was there. But in the comics he is just alone and he was never meant to go on the boat because he was being robbed. 

So with this is mind and now knowing Ollie is destined to marry Black Canary in the comics at some point (which by the way, is that Laurel or Sarah). That being said, am I now to expect the TV Ollie to fall back towards Laurel or am I okay to hope and wish for Ollie to accept Felicity's love and they live happily ever after? 

This was poorly written I know. All I have to say is sorry, it's been a long day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I like to think I'm a big comic book fan but in reality I just love the movies, games, tv shows. 

So I've decided I'm going to get into the comics. But I have nooooo idea where to start. Like you have all these different versions of each hero. Young batman, old batman, the detective. Where do I start? 

Specifically I'd be looking for Superman, Green Arrow, The Flash and maybe touch on Batman. Maybe some green lantern too then slowly move into all the Justice League stuff.

So where would I start? Is there an app I can get for my pc? Is there a website that I can sub to and read them as a side-scrolling deal? Do I need to order them online and if so how much is the typical comic book? I wouldn't be looking for any super special editions or anything, just enough to start my adventure I guess. 

Just to add in. Going to my local store and asking for advice is a no-go... I don't have a store within reasonable distance.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I played the first Arkham game and did enjoy it. The detective, stealthy feel to it was great and refreshing but I don't remember the story much but I did enjoy it. 

I skipped Arkam city because I had no console but I got to play pieces of it on occasion but I never thought about buying it once I picked up a console.

So now Origins is on sale for 15 euro (which is a decent amount of money for me right now) and I have to know. Is Origins just a fancy title for another game in the Arkham series or while I actually get a good and flowing origin story? 

(I guess this could be added here but if it's not this game it's going to be Injustice and Skate 3 instead of it.. Even though I doubt they'd have great stories, it's just the other option.)(ooooorr.. You know... Fallout 3 is just 15 euro.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> So lets face it, the season just started and we're all flying around, rushing rifts and doing grifts for that loot. But unless you're rolling in a party (like me) it may become tiresome or just... Not super entertaining for the first few hours, levels, however you want to look at it. 

But putting aside that pointless paragraph I've come to find myself listening to the game of thrones audiobook while I grind. This is in fact stereotyping in the way that d3 players love other fantasy stuff and have watched game of thrones and if you have and have considered reading, just listen to the audiobooks while you grind this. It completes 2 tasks at once. Getting gundo gear for your monk and enjoying the great adventure that is A Song of Ice and Fire.

You may find this post scrambled, written poorly and just a mess in general, which it is. I just thought I'd share my new favorite way to grind D3.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> SO BEFORE WE DIVE INTO THIS. I HAVE NO READ THE LATER BOOKS SO PLEASE DON'T SPOIL ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T NEED TO BE SPOILED FOR SEASON 5!!!

So Bran is not in this season. Just completely gone from the world for an entire season. 

Is this because they rushed his story? At least, I'm guessing they rushed his story because, well.. It seems rushed I guess? 

How do you guys feel about this because where they left us with Bran, was pretty exciting and seems to have a major, major role in the world. But.. They're just gonna stop it there for a season (2 years if you go from season 4 finale)... That's kinda frustrating right?

I don't know where I was going with this post but I had to share my jumbled up thoughts about the matter because it seems weird to me that they're dropping a main character for a season and plan on just bringing him back up the season after. Like how will they fill that in, all this time has passed and now he's just done his training? I don't know.. 

Love to hear your thoughts on this but like I shouted at the start, I'm only about 100 pages into ACOK so if you can hold back on anything that may ruin my experience I'd appreciate that but if it is just some small details that would help me understand this I'd be grateful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So a guy I know is trying to put together a little movie. Just basics, he has the video, the speaking and the music he is using..

The only problem is that.

Whenever he goes to add the  music it replaces the voices and when he adds the voices it replaces the music.

He only has the trial and I'm 95% sure he's using this program (it's been a few days since we talked).

So is there a way to do this? A forum to help? A video tutorial?

Anything? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I like to believe I have a lot of movies under my belt but I don't really. I usually struggle to watch movies during the day because I'm busy playing a game, reading or whatever. But now with Netflix I can just scroll, click and watch. 

So far I've watched Chef and tried American Horror Story (leaving that behind).

What else should I watch that I may not think of while looking through the recent section on a torrent site?

I'm down for something artsy (but not too far artsy). A documentary. A tv show. 

I just want to make use of what I have been missing and don't know where to start.

TL;DR Just suggest some movies/documentaries/tv shows that are available on NA Netflix </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So a bit of backstory. Right now I'm in Youthreach.

After my Junior I moved from Dublin to Meath and where I moved to, both schools were full and the waiting list was too long for my mam's patience and she put me into youthreach. 

2 years later and I'm about to finish youthreach with a level 4.

the only problem is... What I plan on doing in college would be some kind of history and literature (as broad as that sounds) and going to youthreach I have completely forgotten my history facts and everything.

So anyway, I feel if I want to succeed in college I should go back to school and re-learn everything I've forgotten (which I have the time for.. sadly). 

Is it too late? </TEXT>

So anyway, I've found a series to start off my journey and just have to know if I can trust what they say. </TEXT>

It's so, so much harder. Knowing the fate of Ned this season makes it worse. He keeps having these little touching scenes with his family and even the king and I am just sitting here thinking *"Maybe it'll be different this time.. He can't die this time..."*

When he told Jon he'd tell him about his mother the next time they see eachother. 

How he just talked to Arya about owning a sword, how Sansa will have to marry Joffrey one...

It's so painful to watch but so great at the same time.

Just have to add in something.. I just watched the scene when Dany realizes she's pregnant... I smiled and felt happy for her..... *oh wait -.-* </TEXT>

But....

When I read he committed suicide.... I broke down crying.

Because of this, having seen the show first, I found it hard to read because it was predictable and I knew what to expect so I got nothing new from it really (apart from the fun in reading and the more in-depth story of course). Now that I'm about to buy ACOK, having already seen the show, is it the same kinda deal? Will I know what to expect or is this where the show starts to move away from the book?

How his life, as I have to imagine, has blown up to an unimaginable degree right? If someone could tell me how long it's been since the last book release I'd appreciate it. But do you guys really, truly want to rush him just because the show is catching him? Do you not trust that by the time he does release it, it would be a whole, whole lot better than it would have been if he cut off parts and threw it out for sale just because a new season is coming up on the show? I'd just like to know if anyone else see's it from his side or if you really don't understand  what is taking him so long.  </TEXT>

His final chapter is him, rotting away in a cell, losing his mind... It is probably the single hardest chapter I've ever had to read(I don't read much but yeah.. I'm trying). He is just in pure darkness, losing it, not knowing if he'd be alive tomorrow, if it was tomorrow or if it was still the same day... I'm loving the books so far but noticing this made me think about his chapter a lot more and it does hurt that his final point of view is that.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [No Spoilers] Guys... We're gonna have a trailer for season 5 within the next 2 weeks.. Can we just take that in? </TITLE>

<TEXT> So I'm in Ireland so I'm not getting any imax viewings but we're more than likely going to get a trailer for it a few days after a shitty leak comes out.. I am only starting to reading the books and even doing that it's taking a long, long time simply because I have no willpower and I am just a gamer, plain and simple, I play LoL for maybe 5+ hours a day and that's including school so.. Yeah, I have a problem but back on point. I just can't wait for this trailer because it's both a trailer for a motherfucking season 5 and it should hopefully get me pumped enough to read more than I do. This post got a bit off topic but I'm just excited...  </TEXT>

I'm not searching for movies like this with her in it(because I've seen them all) but just a movie like this or anything with a really fun to watch, growing relationship on screen.

So the only other MMO I've played is wow and I went alliance and he went horde so we couldn't play together, is it the same setup in this or does choosing the group matter as much? +I'm speaking about quests and dungeons(if this game has them) and not pvp.

<TEXT> The entire movie goes on how everyone knows him. The guy you send to get the boogeyman, the man who laid the foundation for the villain of the movie... Do we not want to see that story? What he was like before the escape and finish with how he got out.. I may be wrong and we could leave this to be a perfect one hit but as we've seen before(taken), people tend to run off the power a one-hit movie makes so if they do, would you want a sequel or prequel? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Interstellar was more emotional than we all expected it to be first time around. But the second time is much worse..[Spoiler Alert] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-23 23:18:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So the first time you watch interstellar(this is all going off how I reacted to it) we got a bit of the feels when he was leaving but then truly sobbed when he got his messages after coming off the water planet. Then you have the Matt Damon, docking scene which was still as intense as hell and you still get the feeling from the soundtrack. Thats another thing! the first time watching it I was focused incredibly on the dialogue and story but this time I noticed the background music playing in scenes. For example towards the end when he's trying to send a sign and the present version of Murph opens the book to see "stay" and they make the music that bit more noticeable, its incredible. As for the scene's with the ghost, specifically when she reads out stay to him as a child, after seeing the movie I know it was him and that was truly gut wrenching. Knowing he is trying to tell himself to stay, it's horrifying. I am of course leaving out some thoughts but please, if you are wondering about watching it again, do it and focus more on the little things, the soundtrack, the foreshadowing, it's just truly a superb movie no matter the opinion of reddit, this will be my second favorite movie of all time. (it would take a true, true piece of work to take that title). So those are my thoughts after re-watching it. I'd love to hear what you think if you've seen it more than once.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I just watched it and... I really enjoyed it but I'm confused as all hell. It started off with me thinking he just had an alter ego type deal, mental illness or whatever. Then he finds himself flying through New York(which is cleared up when you realize he got a cab) and that made me think more mental illness. Then when you got to see all the street performers on stage, spiderman and the transformers etc I started to think if they're talking about the mental issues celebrities can get by being who they are, always reaching to be something after being on the top or how they live a different life to the rest of us and it's not all happiness. Then at the end he shot his nose off after some kind of epiphany? He then went ahead and climbed out his window and I thought his time he did actually jump but then Emma Stone's character looked up and began to laugh, which basically told us he could fly(?) Oh and to add in that entire scene before he flew across the city, he started flying, deflecting bullets, rockets flying everywhere, swat guys. I truly did love the movie and it made it seem it was all one big take(day after day of course) but when the did a scene it seemed to run flawlessly for minutes on end and the camera work was incredible but... Can someone please help me understand this? Of course everything I wrote may be wrong but I wouldn't have a problem with that. I'm just confused.  </TEXT>
