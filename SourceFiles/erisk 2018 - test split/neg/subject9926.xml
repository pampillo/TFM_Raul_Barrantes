<TEXT> I just want to make absolutely sure that no one here is shedding a tear for James Comey. 

Fuck that guy. 

Obama should have put his ass out on the street after:

**he threw the fucking election!!!**

First by insinuating that there was any possibility of a criminal case over the non story emails, and then his letter that cost Clinton the election. 

This cunt can rot in hell, he is personally responsible for this mess. I am hearing a little revisionist history, and conciliatory tones in these threads. 

I would like to remind people

**James Comey had more impact on the elections then the Russians did. If you are not happy with this administration this is the sad sack POS who got us here**

 There is only one thing that could make me happier then the events of today. It is great seeing the man's career in tatters, a pariah on both sides of the aisle. Sitting at home for the 8th day straight, watching the price is right, staring a his phone that only buzzes when someone mentions him negativity. 

That one thing would be a group of FBI agents doing a perp walk, and stuffing him handcuffed into a car leaving the court house where he was just indited, for treason. 

He is not our friend, and he could not be trusted to run this investigation. Bask in the news today, do not shed one tear for this rotten scumbag.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me the only real use case I see for this is the handsfree YouTube videos. That would be nice for cooking. Then again I do have a iPad, and a laptop.  

I guess for shopping it would also be nice to have visual confirmation as well. 

If I didn't already own a echo this is the one I would buy. It will be interesting to see what kind of skills people concoct. I can't really think of any other visual device that was controlled totally by voice. 

The more I think about it this will probably be a absolute god send for disabled people. The echo was already amazing for sight impaired people, but this could be great for quadropalegic people or those with Parkinson's. Not having to type to get content will hopefully help people out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This entire article is based on a farcical idea. If actually read the claims it is BS.

 When connecting wirelessly, Schneiderman writes, subscribers on the 300 Mbps plan typically received 15% of the promised speed; subscribers on the 200 Mbps plan received 20% of the promised speed; subscribers on the 100 Mbps plan received 39% of the promised speed; and subscribers on the 50 Mbps plan received 58% of the promised speed.

The key to this is wirelessly. I have 500 mbps internet. I also have a top of the line highly reviewed Asus router, and anything that is on wifi is 80211.ac rated, and the best in class. I scanned my channels with a professional wifi analyzer, and chose my channel after careful deliberation.

The best speed I have ever reached over wifi even with all the best stuff available on the market is 150mbps. Now is it fair to say that I am only getting less then 1/3 of my speed I pay for? Fuck no it isn't if I plug in hard wired I get the full 500 every single time. I get 100% of what I pay for, but internet speeds have vastly outpaced wifi's ability to deliver them.

Does the author expect ISPs to invent some new wifi standard, or force everyone to buy top of the line enthusiast gear? Also this is NYC where the airwaves are super crowded. No even if everyone gets the nighthawk cable modem, and buys a sweet computer you will still see a small fraction of the speed.

There are limitless reasons to trash the ISPs but this is a hit piece, and founded on BS. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is not a huge hub for SE Asians, in the same sense as Japan, China, and Korea. That being said I have met many Thais, Malaysians , and if their is one cuisine that is overrepresented vs population it would be Vietnamese. There are 4 Vietnamese restaurants within walking distance of me (Kaimuki), and 8 within a mile. I know for thais, and Vietnamese people there is a tight knit community. 

 If you are any flavor of asian you will blend in here. The other great thing for me as a mixed race person, is that people have been crossing racial divides for generations here as well. So While there are many people who are 100% this or that, chances are if you stay in hawaii long enough you have that one Grandma who ran off with a white guy, or the one grandpa who shacked up with a african American girl. It isn't that big a deal here, and that is awesome.

Back to the Asian thing though. Just having the majority of people being some flavor of Asian has put a lot of out of state transplants, at ease in a way they didn't realize was possible.

<TEXT> The crux of the issue is that T-Mobile bills themselves, as a consumer first company. Their implementation of their promotions for the past few years have continued to set bad precedents. With the one plan customers are technically getting even access to most providers, however video is throttled, unless you jump through a convoluted process to unlock HD. ATT saw them getting away with it, and launched DTV now which is 0 rated against your data, in flagrant violation of NN.

When speaking on NN it is hard to have a conversation on every factor, since the definition is a constantly shifting. With the zero rating of spotify vs daves music streaming service, then the compression of videos from big companies that was on by default, and now the byzantine process of watching a HD video with day passes Tmobile continues to find ways to interject themselves between you and the digital diaspora. They throttle this, and promote this as a partner, they make big shows about providing more for less but 1,000 ft view a lot of these policies are very consumer hostile. 

Devils advocate, no one was ready for the onslaught of people finally realizing the power of their phones to watch tv, listen to music, and podcasts, upload live videos etc. In some sense a lot of these policies were enacted as a compromise, to alleviate congestion on a network not yet robust enough to suddenly handle 10 times more traffic. I get it.

That being said, we are now in a world where Tmobile leads the industry. It is safe to say that they have turned the wireless industry upside down, and where they go everyone is forced to follow. That is why I find it disheartening that they are on the other side of this issue. Bottom line for me, what I want is NN legislation written into law, that my ISP, wireless or otherwise, does not have the ability to throttle, or speed up any content that I request over their network. If I exceed my data allotment so be it, but it should be my decision what video is in HD, and which is constrained to 1.5mbps. It should be my decision what audio I listen too, and at what quality it comes to me. 

The ISP has no business tinkering with my data, and while things are at a tollerable level now, be prepared to be extremely outraged in the future. History shows that there is no industry more apt to be given a inch, and take a mile then ISPs. They have a whole gameplan, on how to divide up the internet into nothing but entrenched players, and split the profits. The unlimited data on ATT only for direct TV customers, was only the opening salvo.

<TEXT> Tmobile is leading the way to destroy net neutrality with binge on, and 0 rated data. You can argue that their flavor of violating the spirit of NN is more consumer friendly, but the fact is they are picking winners, and losers. They were at the forefront of this as well, and implemented it long before VZ, and ATT.

In case you are not clear on why allowing you unlimited netflix, and spotify is a bad thing. It is not the company you do business with today that is at stake, it is the new company who you would have done business with tomorrow that can be damaged, by ot having their data prioritized, or included for free. The logical conclusion of 0 rating is that big companies will end up paying ISPs to be included in premium tiers, and upstarts will be locked out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not a analyst or anything, and I am going strictly on anecdotal experience, but I find this hard to believe. I know literally 0 people with LG phones. I am into phones so I will always find out what type of phone people have, to see if it is a area we can small talk about. 

I haven't met a single person in the past year with a LG phone, and I chit chat with people from all walks of life, and socio economic backgrounds at work, and in my personal life. 

I find it hard to believe that one in five people bought a LG phone last year. The G5 was such a flop that all of it's add ons we're 80% off at the TMobile store, not even six months after launch. The V20 certainly picked up a percentage of note 7 refugees (myself included). However it was certainly a niche product, and you had to be 100% committed to phablet life, because it was huge, and ugly. 

I suppose there is a huge subset of people just buying the budget versions, but it still seems like a dubious claim since in my personal experience most people have whatever the budget Samsung of the moment is, or just buy year old flagships.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> At first my phone wouldn't fast charge on any of my third party fast chargers from Anker, or aukey(both of which I have verified to work on many other devices). Every time I plug in I get a message saying, that my device is slow charging. 

Forgot to plug in last night so threw it on the charger at 9am this morning. Came back at 10:30am and I was only at 65%, and it wasn't indicating fast charging. I was using included charger, and included USB c cable. 

I also had a day this week when I plugged in over night, and was only at 85%the next morning. 

Is my phone defective? </TEXT>

Almost everyone you deal with from the cops, to the bank teller, to the cable guys are going to be predominantly Asian. Wherever your family comes from there will most likely be a wide variety of restaurants catering to your cuisine, and a rich community of people who celebrate your traditions  Asian culture has been intertwined with Hawaii for many generations, so you will be a insider and have a advantage over others based solely on being Asian.

<TEXT> If you have access to a good quality large monitor you can see for yourself. Cue up a photo in apple photos, and then toggle to a Google photos backup. On face value they are quite similar, but look at the fine details, and you will find lots of artifacts. Also in my experience they appear to be less vivid, and have less dynamic range after compression. 

Taking a file from 12 MB, to 2 MB will have ramifications no matter what. 

I am a outlier now with large high resolution monitors, and a big 4k tv, but in the future it will be totally mainstream to have wall sized screens, and every bit will count. Not to mention that there will sometime come a day where it will be common place to strap on VR goggles, and really gaze deeply into photos. 

2 of the biggest mistakes I ever made was ripping my impossible to find CD music collection in 128kbps, and buying a crap point and shoot camera for the most pivotal summer of my life. In both cases even in 2017 I wish I had a time machine to go back and tell past me to do it right the first time, and not cut corners. Instead I am listening to low quality mp3s, and looking at blurry photos on my high end modern gear.  </TEXT>

I personally love the laid back work culture out here. People get enrichment from their lives, and don't take work to seriously. 

If you are ambitious, and career minded Hawaii is certainly not the place for you. Your skills will wither, and being around so many people just phoning in their work for a check will drive you mad.

<TEXT> I did not. 

However I did have it off the market for 4-5 months as I DIY renovated it. Although it is technically breaching the contract to get a loan under the auspice of using it as a rental, there is 0 enforcement. You can buy a property and rent it out the next month. If anyone asked you could just say that circumstances changed. 

The beauty of this setup is that you can build equity while still living comfortably in a rental that fits your needs. All the while writing off tools, gas money, and depriciation on appliances. You can even write off your association dues. 

Then after paying it off you either have passive income, or have built a bunch of equity you can trade for a house of your dreams without much sacrifice.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One word of advice is to look at investment property before you buy your home. I didn't plan it this way, but I ended up buying a rental property long before I bought a house for myself. It was the best move I ever made. 

As far as tax benefits go I am much better off with the rental property. 

Essentially you buy a property that may not fit your standards, but you can easily afford. Let someone else pay your mortgage on it, and reap all the tax incentives. If times ever get tight you can live in it for a while.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Harsh reality is that you need to choose between kids, and a comfortable lifestyle here in Hawaii. If you have kids, you not only need a extra bedroom for them ($$$), your school district will play a huge roll in their education. Obviously the wealthier schools will be better, forcing you to buy even more expensive housing. Or you could send them to punahou...

We decided against the crotch fruit, and live comfortably on dual income no kids salaries. Own property, and are on top of all bills. However my co workers with kids are sometimes pay check, to paycheck bringing home $85-100k. That is far from fuck you money, but save for the Bay area, and NYC you can carve a comfortable middle class existence out with $100k anywhere in the country. 

If kids were in the cards for me I would be leaving Hawaii ASAP. Which really is a shame because this seems like a great place to raise a family. It is safe, and culturally diverse. Just the kind of environment that would foster some well rounded offspring.  </TEXT>

The most important being that in the top row you will now see a option to expand all images, or you can use key command shift+x. No more clicking on links everything is displayed on the page, and you can go into only the content that is worth it to you. 

It will also allow you to browse a never ending stream of Reddit pages in line. (this does become resource intensive) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Has there ever been a worse name for a sports car the Prelude?

Prelude:

noun


 a preliminary to an action, event, condition, or work of broader scope and higher importance.



Before every car was relegated to a alphanumeric designator, they had names. Teams of men sat in smokey Madison avenue boardrooms, and hashed them out. They would look for a word that evoked a certain emotion. The Ford mustang, for the rugged individualist cowboy. The Dodge viper signifies the sinuous styling, and the potency of the performance. 

What exactly are you supposed to be gleaning from the name Prelude? It is like they picked a random word out of the dictionary. They should have named it the crescendo, or the finale, something with machismo and authority. 

Then again it takes a wishy-washy cunt to buy a FWD sports coupe in the first place.  </TEXT>

That may sound calous but with the exception of one of my friends who died as a passenger, I am still genuinely angry at them that they were so stupid, and caused their family so much pain.

<TEXT> I am pretty insane with kitting out my bike. Basically the only think left stock on my escape is the frame, and the drivetrain. That will change next year when I upgrade the components lol. 

First thing I did to my escape was cut about 1.5 inches off of the handlebars on each side. They are too wide for city riding. Then I took off the saddle in exchange for a squishy one. I put full planet bike fenders on, ditched the crap pedals for some big comfy platform pedals. The stock tires are also crap so I put on specialized armadillos at a much larger 700x32. 

All that ran me around $225 but really made it my ideal commuting bike. That really solved all the shortcomings I found from the factory. 

Then I started doing the cargo aspect. I got a rear rack, and a big wald front basket. I cycled through a bunch of paneers but settled on 2 Timbuktu bags. 

[Basket](http://i.imgur.com/btUF0ac.jpg)

[Handlebar accessories](http://i.imgur.com/ig2kDKG.jpg)

I have gone pretty nuts with accessories on the bars. Burger Bell, rearview mirror, cup holder, cellphone do k, and super super bright flashlight, with adapter. 

It is now certainly the SUV of bikes, but it really didn't add that much to the weight. I still move out with it no problem. I rarely ever even drive my cars these days. I even do my grocery shopping via bike.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just a few random thoughts:

On the lower end I would avoid specialized unless there is a sale. In recent years they have begun skimping on components for their entry level bikes, and at msrp you will be paying a premium to get the logo. If that is the only LBS then go ahead, but shop around, and be sure to take decently long test rides to be sure that the geometry fits you. 

As a fellow big guy I recommend you start out with a hybrid bike. I also have a fancy specialized carbon road bike, but it is not ideal for commuting. I currently have the giant escape, and it is layed out very well for a tall rider. 

Do not skimp on accessories. It really makes all the difference to dial in a bike exactly for what you want. I would plan on immediately changing out the saddle, pedals, and tires as soon, as I get any bike. You should include this in your buget as this will run around a additional $150-200. 

I highly recommend you get some puncture resistant tires. I personally really like my specialized armadillo 700x32 I am currently riding, some people find them too hard, and swear by gatorskin tires. As a big guy we are much more apt to get flats then a 150lb rider. With the armadillo tires I rarely ever get flats. 

Make sure to get a decent pump, and never leave the house without pumping to the recommended psi. Heavy riders will get pinch flats all the time. If the tires are not pumped up it is easy for the rim to hit the tire, and poke a hole. 

Another really important thing to get is as bright a set of lights as possible. I use a flashlight adapter, and a generic Amazon 18650 flashlight that ran me about $20. This combo is brighter then most bike specific lights that cost over $100. Invest in a really bright tail light as well. If you are not a slave to fashion then wearing a high visibility vest is also highly recommended. Remember all cars are out to kill you, and the impitus is on you to be visible. 

Bags are a matter of preference. A rear rack is a must though. A good inexpensive beginer setup is a rear rack with a milk crate zip tied to it. Then get a cargo net with hooks to secure your bag inside. 

Paneers are quite expensive, and no one has yet to nail the perfect ones yet. The dual ones are great but a pain to carry around. I have settled on a Timbuktu tote bag, and messenger bag with waterproofing but neither is ideal. Go for the milk crate, and water resistant backpack first, and get a feel for how much gear you want to tote. 

You will need a tool kit. Never leave the house without a spare tube, tire levers, and a small pump. You should also buy a collapsable rain coat. I have a few Patagonia ones that fold down to the size of tennis balls, but have saved my ass many times. A more affordable one is the Columbia rain coat which I think runs around $30. 

All of this is expensive. Your kit will probably exceed the cost of the bike, but think about how much gas, parking, or even a bus pass costs over time, and you will eventually come out ahead. 

Plus you will eventually be a slightly less big guy in the end. 

Good luck

I have the same bike! 

I love mine. Picture is before it took it's final form with 32 wide tires, and Timbuktu saddle bags. 

I was actually going to buy a Cannondale that was priced much much higher then this. My salesman told me to take this for a spin, and I was in love. 

Only complaint is the cheap components. I will give them another year or so, and then I am going to totally redo them with something better.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in the same situation as you. I have a roubaix, and my LBS cautioned me against putting a rack on my seatpost. 

I ended up buying a Giant escape hybrid for commuting, and outfitting it with a basket, and 2 Timbuktu saddle bags.  I can now stop at the grocery store on the way home, and load up a decent amount. I also set it up to be super comfy for a casual ride squishy seat, 32 wide tires, lots of lights, cell phone holder, and ice coffee cup holder. 

I have 0 regrets. I love my road bike, but honestly I much prefer to ride the upright comfortable position on the way to work. Also ironically since my giant is a triple, vs double on the road bike it climbs hills much easier and I arrive less sweaty. 

It is nice to keep the road bike as my weekend ride. Makes it feel special when I pull it out, and theft is a big problem here, so it is liberating to be able to leave the giant parked withoutworrying that my $$$ bike is going to walk away.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am as guilty of this as anyone, but as cyclists we often get into a zone going down hill, and often don't account for the repercussions of our speed. There is nothing more fun then bombing hills, but in a emergency situation, you either get lucky, or are going to be in a world of pain. 

You got lucky today. 

My advice is to slow it down. As far as the wobble you will have a hard time diagnosing it, but I would be your brake got stuck, or your wheel wasn't tightened properly. Honestly it cannot be avoided in all cases when a wheeled object is traveling at a high velocity, and makes a drastic change of course you are bound to lose stability.

Honestly it is better on a bike. On a board it is the longest couple seconds of your life knowing that you are going too fast, and nothing is going to save you from the asphalt.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> well it probably was PER CAPITA. Cause it was a few wealthy plantation owners,  and lots of slaves. Slaves were only "3/5th" and for the purposes of calculating per capita income they probably weren't counted at all.  so it skews it even more.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Man TMobile has been insanely bad lately. I really don't understand why all these areas I used to have lightning fast connection have slowed to the point that watching a video is laughable, and I can barely even stream NPR. 

I am on the s8+, and the same could be said about my iPhone 7+ I just traded in.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> At the time (November 2015) TMobile was only offering 128kbps. It is anecdotal, but it seemed to run much slower then other countries I have traveled to with the free data. To my recollection, manually switching carriers didn't make much of a difference. 

It was much to slow to run maps, and doing any serious research for activities. 

In a lot of countries you need to jump through hoops, and deal with language barriers to get a local sim. There are Vodafone stores everywhere, and it couldn't have been simpler to get it setup. I think it was well worth the money to get fast data.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can only speak to south island, but we did have coverage all through the rural areas. It was to slow for me though so I ended up buying this. 

http://www.vodafone.co.nz/travel-sim/

They range from $29 to $99 for 1-8 gb. The Vodafone Sim had flawless coverage, and fast speeds. 

I found it necessary because unlike most places I have traveled the wifi is very tightly metered in NZ. Even in my relatively high end hotel in Queenstown, we were limited to only 1 gb of data per night. If you go to a coffee shop, you are often given a code for comically small amounts of data like 50mb.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure what's going on but there seems to be no functional proximity sensing on my S8. The phone is constantly on inside my pocket. Whenever a notification comes in,  the phone lights up and detects the rustling in my pocket as touches. 

It has caused all kinds of havok already. It sent a photo to a long forgotten 25 family member group chat for a aunt who passed away, and called a bunch of people I really did not want to call, (especially my ex GF). 

What is going on, and how do I stop it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My next door neighbor back in the day was a ultra marathon douche. He used to run full Sprint on his treadmill for like 90 minutes straight every day. We lived in a development where all the houses formed a courtyard in the back with screened in porches. 

He wore shorts even tighter, and higher cut then these. He positioned his treadmill looking out at the courtyard, and for 90 minutes per day his cock was just flapping around for 10 houses of people to look at. Literally 0% of his cock was contained by the shorts. 


At least I was on the other side. The guys in the duplex next to him got to here the sounds of testicles slapping thighs over the roaring treadmill every day.  </TEXT>

 I can't perfectly articulate, where this becomes unethical, but creating all the conditions for someone to commit a crime, and then arresting them before they have the chance to have second thoughts is somehow beyond upstanding for me. 

This is essentially the same as the police doing a bait car sting, and arresting a guy as soon as he looks in the window.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Despite every reviewer mentioning it, I think they still glossed over how crap the fingerprint location is. Luckily I usually have my phone set to be unlocked by my gear fit so it isn't a huge deal, but otherwise I would be pretty annoyed by it. I mostly use my phone in a cradle in my car that does not face me so Iris, and face unlock are not a option. On average I probably unlock the phone 100+ times in the cradle, so typing a pin every time would be maddening.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of all the technologies that ISPs use to provide home broadband, fiber is by far the most robust. Dsl is limited in its bandwidth, and cable is generally fed with a node system where they will run fiber to your neighborhood, but then divide that circuit amongst many different houses. In my experience with fiber internet (not FiOS, but similar) I have never had a issue with congestion, or packet throttling. 

For years Comcast, and other cable ISPs have used packet sniffers to find people torrenting, and slow them down.  There was a time when bit torrent was consuming over 20% of all the world's traffic. To my knowledge Verizon does not use this practice. 

Kodi functions in a way much different then bit torrent. When you use a stream off of Exodus, you are actually connecting to a server, and streaming directly from it. When you torrent you are connecting to many individual other users with the same file, and downloading from many people at once. 

The thing with Kodi is that is does not have the ability to adjust for current bandwidth available. I have watched the traffic on my router, and in some instances HD streams can be consuming over 20mbps consistently for the entire period of the movie. 

Even though you have more then enough bandwidth coming into your home, your local network may not be able to handle these speeds. This is especially true if you use whatever router was provided from Verizon. ISPs are notoriously cheap with their equipment, and let things linger for years past their prime. I'm not sure what Verizon gives you, but my ISP provided me with a 80211.g router with my 300 mbps package. In ideal conditions it would max out at 50 mbps wirelessly. 

From what you are saying my best guess would be that you are using a router with inadequate bandwidth. To find out for sure try plugging devices in with a cable and seeing if that helps. If you rely on wifi then you should probably get a new router. 

The TP Link archer is very well reviewed and inexpensive on Amazon.

<TEXT> Kodi is illegally streaming, and contingent on the servers you are connecting to. They are often located in foreign countries, and with the exploding popularity of Kodi, are getting more bogged down. 

They also do not have the same capabilities of Netflix or YouTube, where they can scale down to a lower resolution depending on bandwidth. If you select 1080p it will give you 1080p only. Depending on your device if you pause it, and allow a buffer to build up it may help. 

If you have issues with streaming Netflix, then you can blame it on VZ, but with Kodi it will be hit or miss depending on myriad issues. 

I have 300mbps fiber,hard wired, cat 6, directly into a Nvidia shield. Basically the best possible kodi setup possible. I still will have issues with HDstreams from time to time.  </TEXT>

Where the head scratching direct TV merger with ATT starts making a lot of sense is if they roll out fixed broadband, and start challeging ISPs in entrenched markets. 

The writing is on the wall that TV services will be delivered over the top in the next 5 years so buying a undiversified company like dish in a dying industry is stupid. Better to wait a few years until cord cutting becomes more mainstream, and buy the spectrum seperately as dish looks to sell off assets.  </TEXT>

I doubt used s8+ will be worth more then $570 by October. However I wish I could take advantage of one of the EIP deals like Sams Club that brings the phone down to $700.  The Verizon guys are certainly getting a better deal the JOD.  </TEXT>

With cable you have 100 channels, and want to move around myriad options, quickly. The remote just isn't up to task. OTT really won't make sense until it is all on demand, and only your favorite stuff is presented to you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah this is my problem with T-Mobile. I am actually ok with the coverage. For the most part I can deal with the dead spots in unpopulated areas. This certainly isn't ideal and will be a big issue when I travel to rural PA for a month later this year.  Day to day, I rarely leave the city. Credit where it is do, I drove to a bunch of places this weekend that used to suck, that they have recently filled in. 

However they really need to upgrade their backhaul. I never realized how charmed my life was when I was on unlimited, and everyone else was on tiered plans. Since the one plan launched my data is crawling everywhere I go. 

Hopefully VZ's more ideal spectrum, and head start will stop the same from happening to them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just the guys phone number is enough for the police to find out who he is. The thing is that the burden of proof is on you, and you 
need to plead your case to the police. Did you have any email, or text correspondence with the guy? If he agreed to terms over text that may be enough.


I won't chastise you for this. People suck, in general. For future purchases, try to agree to meet, at a VZ store. Also ask to see ID, and draft up a bill of sale for anything over a few $100. It certainly is awkward asking people to make something casual seem much more official, but you will protect yourself in the long run.

Good luck, I hope the police are willing to help. If not you can always sell the phone for parts, and I believe that even if it is blacklisted on VZ, it may still work on other carriers so you may still be able to sell/give it away with a thorough explanation of the situation.

<TEXT> Just so you know Verizon is pretty shady about how they pay off your phones. They give you TIV, then space the rest out over bill credits. 

I am in the process of switching, and I cannot use my phones (Iphone 7+, and one plus 3) I have found that I am better off selling them off private party, then utilizing VZ offers. 

All of VZ versions of promotions seem to be modern day contracts that lock you into 24 months of bill credits. If you are the type that keeps phones, then that is fine, but I change all the time so paying retail is better for me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some of you guys have no empathy for a shitty situation. Sorry that happened to you OP. 

Personally I would text the guy something along the lines of. 

"The phone you sold me has a outstanding balance on it. I'm sure that you intended to take the money I gave you, and pay it off in full Immediately. Because otherwise that would be fraud, and I will be contacting the police, and this will escalate from there"

It won't take a lot to find out all the guys information from just the phones serial number.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah there are a lot of side benefits to uber, besides the cost, and convenience. For women, especially in these countries outside the USA, it is much safer to take a uber. There is a record of you interacting with this specific person, vs hailing some random guy on the street.

Even for myself who is a big burly guy, I feel it is much safer for me as well. I have had some crazy taxi rides with driver who were some combination of piss drunk, high, insane, over the borderline into scary religious. You never know who you will, get and you have no recourse. 

There was a Expos in the paper out here, where they requested to see the complaints filed by passengers against taxi drivers. The reporter described them rooting through a unorganized filing cabinet, and fishing out stacks of unaddressed claims, some going as far as assaults, fare theft, unwanted sexual talk with women etc.

The Taxi commission literally just filed everything under fuck you in this filing cabinet. The guy representing them also dug his grave, by insinuating that they have no way to know what cab is driven by whom, and even then they don't really have a enforcement apparatus . </TEXT>

<TEXT>  d kills his way into winning then what, people will still have needs, people will still hold a grudge, things won't magically solve themselves

The problem with Syria is that they are in a quagmire. You have a period of time to execute a coup. Tunisia, Egypt, Libya are in much better shape, because things happened over the span of months not years. After a certain period then usually the dictator will eventually bring the insurgents to heel.


This is exactly what would have happened, if we just let it play out. It would have been a few months of fighting, but Assad would have swept back into control, and then when it was all said and done we could help broker, a peace deal, and perhaps some concessions for the disenfranchised.


Instead our lust to stick our nose into things proves unresistible, yet again gets a bunch of people killed. The US, and UN are aghast, as the phone videos come out showing pretty standard ravages of war in sharper detail, then before.  

Decisive leadership would be to pick a side, and go in 100%, or impose brutal sanctions to force Assad to the table. Instead we do a bunch of wishy washy, mixed messaging, threaten to do no fly zones, start handing out a bunch of guns to random guys. Generally just dipping our toe into the conflict. All the while the rebels (who lost years ago), are getting slaughtered wholesale in slow motion.

I was a huge Obama fan, but on this issue I think he totally screwed up. On the other hand I hated 99% of Trumps platform, but his pledge to stop being the world police actually had me on board.

Now I hate 100% of his platform.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> i understand what you are getting at but for many reasons, it is a false equivalence.

A lot of things have changed since then. Also the French Revolution started from within, and was not a proxy war for a bunch of competing foreign interests. While I am sure their were many factions competing for power after all was said, and done, France didn't have anywhere near as much tribal infighting as the ME. 

There will never be a moment where these people sit down, at a table, and break bread diplomatically. We will ultimately find another dictator to prop up, we will turn a blind eye to him trampling human rights, and he will sit every party at a table with a gun to their head.

And this will all have been a exercise in futility.

<TEXT> I think this is a huge hurdle to clear for politicians . 

I just think of the last election where I liked both candidates back in 2008. I was a fan of Obama, and McCain. I felt both would have done a good job, and in a lot of ways I am actually fiscally conservative, so it could have gone either way. 

However I would never vote for McCain because he would have undermined women's reproductive rights, and I am pro choice. If the rolls were ever reversed on just a few social issues I would have considered voting for a (neo)conservative candidate.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am far from a bigot, but I am a realist. 

Look at pictures of Baghdad, Tripoli, Alleppo before, and after American interventionist democracy came to town. 

Before: there were clean streets, modern amenities, international airports, global chain stores, a large middle class of people going to work. 

After: Rubble strewn streets. All signs of normalcy hacked down, and burned for warmth in the harsh winter. Utilities not working, impossible to educate the children, government graft that was already bad, gets to the point where nothing gets done without a bribe. No services, or sense of security. 

No way to sugar coat it. The Dictators were bad men. If the stories are true, they were capable of murdering a bunch of innocent people just to prove a point. The thing is that so are we, our policy of running to people's aid indiscriminately shooting rockets, and machine guns in every direction leads to so much collateral damage that in the end we are worse. 

I'm sure if you ask one of the millions of widows, parents of dead children, or children of dead parents if they are better off now that democracy has come to town, they will say "no". 


If Sadam were still in power. 4000 plus American troops would still be alive. Over 1,000,000 iraqui people would still be alive, ISIS in its current form would have never existed, the trash in Bagdad would have gotten picked up every tuesday, and alternate side of the street parking would be in effect Thursday to let the street sweeper through. America would have been a lot better prepared for the 2008 crisis, all that money would have been in our coffers, instead of spilled in the sand hamfistedly trying to change a culture by destroying it. 

The truth is that it is not our business to spread democracy. It is in our best interest to be a shining example of it. With the internet prevalent now, people will put pressure on their government, and slowly make changes, until some semblance of a modern progressive lifestyle emerges. 

The thing is the people need to work inside the system, and we need a all powerful leader in place to deal with the unique political landscape of the Middle east. I am all for applying political pressure to expedite change. In a alternate version of history peace and prosperity would have eventually come to the middle east, as the internet spread and ideas formed. That is not what happened though. 

America is totally to blame for all this chaos. It started with toppling sadam, then standing back and allowing the Arab spring to happen. Our democracy never gave these poor people a chance.

<TEXT> Even in light of the chemical attack, backing Assad is the only path to stability. It is a bitter pill to swallow, but as the saying goes, better the devil you know. 

We have numerous examples of what happens when we allow a dictator to topple. All the empirical evidence from Libya, and Tunesia suggests that chaos will fill the vacuum. 

The hard truth is that our foreign policy during the entire Arab spring, was all wrong. It is nice to have the ideal that toppling a cruel dictator in the middle east, will suddenly convert every resident there into progressive, forward thinking, productive members of the free world. 

The sad truth is that in its current form the Arab world cannot function without a strongman government. The only successful instance of this is Turkey, and every day that goes by, Erduogan become something closer to a dictator. 

The only road to peace is to back Assad, and finish what the Russians started, then slowly through, carrot, and sticks start to rebuild peacful territories. Then as more people willingly bend to Assad, have the international community come in, and provide aid, help rebuild, and restore some semblance of normalcy. 

I think if given the option of endless war or a path back to a life, the people of Syria would come back together under Assad.  </TEXT>

I don't really see this as a Democrats position at all. The more I think about it they were probably just trying to get ahead of the story, and wanted to avoid being called weak, but in doing so they gave him his first victory under terrible precident. 

With trump you need to think of everything like you are dealing with a child. You never want to reinforce any bad behavior. To give bipartisan support to a impulsive bombing raid, he will surely remember this the next time he is in a corner, and perhaps it will have higher stakes then the international pariah Assad.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes but the US phoning Russia well ahead of time, and then bombing one base, is not the type of aggression that would actually be crossing a line. In the scheme of things things this is a bump in the road. Obama crashed their economy, and it is still crashed to this day. 

If you really take the 10,000 foot view Assad, Putin, and Trump all win in this scenario. Sure a airstrip, and I would assume some expensive planes blew up. 
However Assad gets to look even more ruthless to his foes, Trump gets to look like he did something, and Putin gets to feign outrage thus taking some air out of the Russia scandal. 

Also how Trump treats Syria, and the Russians going forward are not necessarily a indication of what happened last year. If things get really bad with the investigation, expect him to do some rash things to prove he is anti russia. 

There is a line a mile long of people who made deals with trump, who ended up out in the cold, holding the bag. I have no doubts that Trump will eventually renig on whatever quid pro quo, he had established with Moskow.

<TEXT> Yup. This article spells out my thoughts of these developments word for word. It gives trump cover that he is going against Putin, but Puton doesn't actually care about Syria. It is a proxy war on 15 different levels, the least of which is caring what happens to Assad. 

If he were to play his cards right he could maneuver this into a huge (short lived) political win. He has a cordial dinner with the PM of China, and then reigns hell fire on a country, while he is sleeping at Trumps house. This bolsters Trump as a tough guy with China, N Korea, and is a smoke screen on Russia. 

Luckily Trump is a blithering idiot, and will be right back to stepping on his own nuts within moments, and the news cycle will still be all Russia, and his non stop gaffes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's actually the mixed messaging that is the most dangerous part of Trumps foreign policy. A man who has no convictions, and who's elegances change depending on who is the room, is the last person who should be making these decisions. 

We need a resolute leader. W was wrong to invade iraq, but he never had his secretary of state, and UN envoy out there insinuating we would stand down. When US troops lives are on the line, then he needs to pick a option and stick to it. 

I would say he should just defer to Mattis, but even though he seems more sane then all of the other jabronis, he is quite hawkish, and may decide to get us in yet another quagmire.  </TEXT>

I don't know how to break it to you, but you overpaid a ungodly amount of money on this POS. I have seen e9x m3s for less then that, and right now I would have my pick of loaded 335i, or even 535i for way less then that. 

Do yourself a favor, and hang onto that car for a few years at least, you will have your heart sattered if you try to sell it.

And yes I am switching for the network. Normally it is no issue, but my GF will be doing a project in a rural area for the next 6 months, and T-Mobile is no where re to be found out there. I have never had a issue, but rarely leave metro Honolulu. I will certainly miss the free international. 

I honestly will just go back to paying cash for my phones. No big deal, I just needed help navigating this step. Even in the links provided to me by the other guy it is still very ambiguous, about how you receive your money back.

I would be getting their S8+ so $450+$200 visa right?

So no matter how you cut it all roads lead to $650 from vz. If I do as others suggest, and sell on swappa for hopefully $600 net, and walk up to best buy with no phone, does that put me at a advantage? 

I could get the phone for $750 from BB, or $700 from Walmart. I'm just having a hard time rationalizing what is my best move.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For a variety of reasons, I will be bringing 4 tmobile lines over to VZ shortly. I am pretty happy with my 7+, but am also interested in the s8+. 

My question is mostly regarding what to do about my 7+ trade in. I owe $650 on it currently. I understand that VZ will pay my phone off, **or** give me a elevated trade in credit on the s8, but I'm wondering if stacking the best buy or walmart deals would be more beneficial then getting the $650 credit.

I went to a authorized retailer, and left even more confused. The rep said that since they are running the s8 promotion, I had no choice but to take the $480, and then the $170 difference would be made up in bill credits, over the span of 24 months.

There is no way in hell I will keep the phone for 2 years, and will most likely, be headed to the iphone 8 in fall regardless. How does this effect, the math?

TL DR am I better off getting $650 up front (jump through a bunch of hoops for bill credits), or buying phone from walmart/bestbuy and getting refunded over time?

Unrelated question



What is the best $400 phone for my GF, with the camera being her top priority?

Then there is the small issue that no one knows where **ALL** the nukes are. So we not only would have to destroy them we would also be racing against time to secure everything before it disappeared. The power vacuum that this would create would also cause a situation as bad as the Arab spring, and Trump would be cursed for generations, for not exhausting every diplomatic avenue.  </TEXT>

If you continue to allow them to act like this, then you only have yourself to blame when it continues. My parents were so apathetic, that they may as well have been roommates, but I have a few Asian friends whos parents were controlling all the way into adulthood. Each of them eventually ripped the band aid, and confronted their parents eventually. I would say those who did it earlier were better off. </TEXT>

There are people who read Dianetics as gospel, and belive every word on info wars. 

People look for validation. If you can find a outlet that will reinforce your shitty beliefs, then you will tend to believe them. 

For some it is the blog saying 9/11 was a inside job, or the church giving you a deeper meaning by promising a afterlife. For you it was Motor Trend convincing people that the less reliable, slower, second hand ice cream cone depreciating, marginally better handling Mazda 6 was the smart choice over a Camry/Accord.

<TEXT> I love T-Mobile, and have even encouged many people to switch over. However I have been running into a lot of issues recently. To make matters worse my GF is working on a project in a rural area off, and on for the foreseeable future. T-Mobile has 0 coverage within 15 minutes of her site, meanwhile Verizon is fully usable. 



I really want to stick with T-Mobile, but I have been encountering more, and more dead spots, and also more congested towers. 


I want to believe Neville that he has this together, and help us on the way, but I am on the fence if I should stay. 


I was just wondering of someone with a deeper understanding of the spectrum auction, possible sprint merger, and work in progress is actually going to make their coverage rival Verizon, or if it is just smoke.

<TEXT> I don't abuse JOD. I only used it once last year to jump to Note 7. After everything went down, I was forced to get a iphone for a few months, until the S8 came out.

**REALLY** disappointed that I am going to have to now (for the first time) have to pay $130 for the most basic S8+ available for me to purchase. 

One of the core reasons I am staying with tmobile, despite sketchy coverage, and in light of the VZ Unlimited deal, is JOD.

I really hope they reconsider this.

The majority of time it is someone giving a presentation that is not at all pertinent to anyone in the room, or just having a one way conversation with us, and not asking for input at all. It could easily all be avoided by just sending out a email. 

But then what would all the middle managers do? It seems that there only function is to stop all work, so that they can verbalize a email topic. Meanwhile the phones are on fire, the world is collapsing into itself, and we are stuck in this meeting trying to hide the animosity in our eyes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's an odd phenomenon when people mod their cars to look like everyone else's. 


You would think that taking a perfectly serviceable car, poured over for months by a team of engineers and designers, then making drastic changes to it's aesthetic, and function would be a act of individuality. 


However taking a clapped out e46, slamming it on its nuts, and buying the same 7 series wheels as a infinite number of other guys, is actually a sign of conformity. It is a signal to all the other douche bros in the stance community that you belong. 

You could probably save yourself some money, and just get really into vaping. You will be able to mingle with the same subset of society, and still be able to go over a speed bump.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember walking past some of the lady boy bars in Phuket Thailand. Directly next door was a like late night tattoo shop. They had a wall of their previous tattoos  up. Lots of standard issue chav shit. 

Then there was one German guy. He was baby fat overweight, and looked late teens. Looked to be from somewhere in the agrarian part of Germany. I have been through there enough to spot a guy from there if I see one. 

Anyway he had his entire chest done up with Tupac standing there cross armed. Then tupacs skinny torso ran down his body, they shared the same belly button, and tupacs six pack was tattooed on his blubber. In true meta fashion he also had tupacs giant THUG LIFE tattoo across his stomach. 

It wasn't  the most I'll advised tattoo of all time, but this dude was not pulling it off in the slightest bit in the picture. The expression on his face was half smile, and half I just had sex with a guy who looked like a girl, did a bunch of drugs, and then had a life sized Tupac tattooed on my large body, this isnt going to end well in small town Germany. 

I was just passing by the photos on the wall but it always stick with me as the most absurd shit I have ever seen.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trust funders. 

One of the many things that bugged the shit out of me when I lived in NYC. I was husltling my ass off to make ends meet, and still have beer/cab/date money. I had a bunch of friends who were just idle, graduated school and were just chilling. Not even looking for work, just on a never ending cycle of hanging out and attending events with other spoiled cunts at 2pm, on a Wednesday.  

The worse part is that they would slum it with the Broke cool kids, and then shoot out to Switzerland for a weekend of heli skiing, and be back on Tuesday dressing poor and acting like nothing happened. 

I will never live there again.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in a similar situation up until recently.  Worked at least 50-60 hours every week for years. 

It was a double edged sword. On one hand I had fuck you money,  helped me advance my standard of living, and purchase a home. 

On the other hand I gained a massive amount of weight, a drinking problem, and a unhealthy relationship with my SO. 

Lately a few things have changed, and my responsibility is shared with a whole other department so suddenly we don't even have volunteer OT. It's almost hard to adjust to the 40 hour week. I almost don't know what to do with myself, all my hobbies withered over the years. It's like I am getting out of jail. 

Luckily I set my life up to run on 40 hour per week, a lot of my coworkers will have a day of reckoning since they have BMW payments, and expensive mortgages to pay.  </TEXT>

Today I was near Ala Moana, so I ran into foodland. Their new bar is pretty amazing. While smaller in size, I actually prefer it to whole foods. I got a nice big salad with tons of tasty ingredients, and some grilled plantains from the hot bar.

Ran me $13.50 but it was good, and I don't feel weighed down.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not native but long time resident. I am lucky enough to travel often, but I still certainly get rock fever(feeling of claustrophobia). 

The most lonely part of living in Hawaii is the constant turnover of friends. This place chews up, and spits people out do to the cost of living. I am constantly saying good bye to great friends, and at the moment I just said goodbye to my BFF bros within the past 5 months. 

It's really hard to get the energy to invest more time in people when you know that eventually they will be leaving.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even if you are relatively affluent it is still hard to eat healthy in Hawaii. In the supermarket often produce can run over $3 a pound. I buy it, but my food bill is a huge part of my budget, and just a simple salad at home can run me $6-7. 

My hardest time is eating on the run, it is just straight up hard to find places that sell healthy food. The vast majority or restaurants sell deep fried, starchy belly bombs.  </TEXT>

Also remember that his platform was very 2 dimensional. While his one issue that he ran on certainly would have had traction with a lot of people, when asked to state his position on a broader range of issues he would have landed very at odds with a lot of social conservatives, and even moderates.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> FYI their router is shit, don't use it. If you got the TV bundle I recommend you set up a switch from their optical modem. You run one port to the HT box, and one to your personal router.

I had to do this to solve some weird issues I was having, and to make port forwarding easier for my security system. 

Overall though 0 complaints about the service, and they have been great about letting me jump to new promotions as the old ones expire. I need to call them soon, but now they are doing for life 300 mbps with basic TV for $50 which is unbeatable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   the large census in that the traffic is just going to be horrendous but it seems that it'll be like that regardless of where I choose to live (Although, I have also read that Ewa Beach is the worse). I checked google maps and set the time to around when I intend to leave and it seems as long as I head out around 5:30 I should hopefully be fine. Honestly, just seems like something that I'll have to adjust myself to and learn about, among many other things.

No matter how fast you get on island most traffic needs to go back to the mainland. The latency makes the internet seem slow here. My mom has only 30 mbps on the east coast, but it feels faster then my 300 mbps HT fiber line.

No way around the fact we are in the middle of the ocean. It is pretty amazing it is as fast as it is considering. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can think of 4 or 5 houses just as bad in kaimuki. We had one around the corner from me in Palolo. Nicest old man in the world lived there, but he had literally mountains of trash, and old bikes. He also had uncontrolled cat colony, and pigeon colony ,so there was shit everywhere.

 I would walk my dog by every night. He just wasn't all there but he was cool AF. Just passed away a few months ago. They buldozed his house and sold it to a chinese guy who plans to throw up a huge rental house. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's perfect I wouldn't change a thing. They say that our choices in cars, and fashion of clothing we wear, are our expression to the world who we are. 

Those around us they pick up social cues from how we present ourselves. To the casual observer the guy in the Mercedes wants to convey wealth, the woman in the loud color mini Cooper wants to let everyone know she is spunky. 

That is why your car is absolutely perfect. At one glance you are conveying to the world that you are a cousin diddling, juggalo, redneck who is trying to put together the money for a pack of Newport's and half a oxy. 

I'm sure this is the look you were going for with a ghost flamed pt cruiser so kudos. Job well done.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I was depressed, and becoming distant to my lovely, and beautiful girlfriend of 10 years. I was so self absorbed that I didn't realize how bad I was hurting her feelings. 

After she tearfully told me how she was feeling I became even more distraught. Over the past few weeks I have been righting the ship on my depression, and trying my hardest to let her know how much I love her, and that she means the world to me. 

We have made a ton of progress, and are back to being lovey dovey for the first time, in a long time. Neither of us are the type to be overly affectionate, but for us this is newlywed levels of PDA.  

We still have work to do, but I think we are back on a good path to a strong partnership, and it makes me very happy that she is happier with me.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It works very well. I got it upgraded with a hybrid drive, but then recently moved to a SSD. With the SSD it is quite snappy. I dont game or do anything extremely intense. That being said it did handle editing some 1080p/60 go pro video with no issues. 

The real benefit of the 2012, is that it is still very modular. It was a 10-15 minute process to swap out the drive. 

My one complaint is that the display GPU technology is a bit out of date. I was planning on getting a 4k monitor, but it won't support it at 60hz. I ended up getting a 1440p monitor which is honestly fine at 32 inches. It does work me that I am limited though.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I switched almost exactly one year ago, and was blown away by the speed vs att. It has really deteriorated since. I have switched phones multiple times since, and even recently had my current 7+ swapped out for a unrelated issue. 

In the past month I have had multiple instances of having 3-4 bars of LTE, but barely being able to even go on websites. I haven't had a chance to document what me speed tests would be, but multiple browsers fail to load. 

I rely on my service for work, and I really cannot have this become the new normal. I hate to sound elitist, but I liked being in the higher tier, and I am concerned that they jumped the gun offering unlimited data to everyone. 

I am actually considering going to Verizon. I have been a huge advocate for T-Mobile, but they really need to get their act together, and start buying more back end to handle all this traffic. 

Have they laid out any initiatives to get this managed? </TEXT>

I would like to thank Apple for designing a case so slippery, that it just shoots right out of your coin pocket on your jeans, and gets run right over by a SUV. I share a lot of fault here, I knew how shit the design was and even bought a case, but I opted not to bring it tonight. 

I consider myself lucky I was able to retrace my bike ride only 2 miles back from my house to find the case unharmed, but one airpod totaled. 

There really had to be a better more functional design the a dental floss container. Some sharp edges, and texture would really go miles to making these less hard to lose. 

After I pay my $80 for one replacement airpod, I will be covering my floss case with grip tape from a skateboard.  

I am pretty salty right now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was having a ton of issue earlier this month. Lots of errors, and even more annoying it would cycle between 720p, down to I don't know 10p. 


Haven't had any errors in the past week. Best of all wow the bandwidth has really markedly improved.  I would say that this is the highest quality hd I have seen for a live streaming service. Not Netflix 4k quality, but it is extremely sharp. 


My main issue is still the interface. I still prefer Vue. However I just figure I would put up a positive post.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My 2012 Imac is running just fine, but is probably at its apex of depreciation. Think I want to unload it while it is still worth something. 

I use a VESA arm for it, and it is pretty ungainly. I want to replace it with a 4k or ultra wide monitor. I don't want to buy a Mac mini, and have it be sluggish at that resolution. I cannot afford, nor do I need a Mac pro. Just need stable high res display

I was just wondering if anyone is running one? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just got my dot setup, and am currently using my Bose sound link from my bathroom to play music. I need to either get a replacement for it, or another speaker for the dot. 

I am running a bit low on discretionary income this month, so I want keep it under $100. 

I was looking at the anker xl Bluetooth speaker on amazon for $60, and the Bose computer speakers for $100. I have heard the bose, and they sound excellent. 

It seems crazy to me that a whole market hasn't sprung up for speakers designed to fit exactly under the dot as a cohesive package. Seems like it would be a no brained to get a slice of the market. 

What is the best small speaker I can get for $100? </TEXT>

I was wondering if there was a way to get my dot to control my stereo? I am hoping to find a way to remotely have it switch to the aux input, and run a long aux cord from the dots location. This way I could have it turn on my multi zone stereo to play music, but work on its own most of the time.

<TITLE> If other car makers came out with a service similar to Cadillac Book, would you join? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-06 10:23:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For those who don't know Cadillac debuted a new subscription ownership model today. $1500 per month, and you have your choice of any fully loaded Cadillac. You can switch between models anytime, up to 18 times per year. Escalade for the road trip, then right back to your cts-v platinum for your commute. All maintenance, and insurance is included in the $1500. 

No long term obligation, and no worries about lease returns over mileage etc. When you are done just turn in the car. 

https://www.google.com/amp/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2017/1/5/14177698/cadillac-book-car-subscription-service-1500-a-month?client=safari

I think this may be a stroke of genius. I am certainly not in the demographic of people with $1500 per month to spend on my choice of any fully loaded Cadillac. However I think this could really translate well to other segments of the car market. This would be especially true if a company could do this across multiple brands. 

Imagine if their was a service for say $5-600 that had a bunch of fun cars to choose from in the $30,000 range like Gtis, Tacoma's, camaros etc. Or scale it to a higher price like $7-800 for mid level luxury cars. 

I would be all over that to sample a bunch of different cars without the stress of dealing with a dealership Everytime, and never worrying about maintenance again. 
The company could just do as the rental car companies do, and blow out the cars after 20,000 miles for pretty good money. 

I would gladly pay a few extra $$$ per month to have the flexibility of just changing cars on a whim.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I really wish I could get a dedicated remote to control my DTV now, or VUE services. Being limited to the paired down UI makes it a huge pita to get around the service. I really miss being able to key in a channel, and just go there. As it stands on my nvidia shield, ATV, PS4 etc to get from one channel to another is like a 70 button tap ordeal.

I know that this is a long shot but these services need to roll out their own remotes to work with streaming boxes if they want to ever go mainstream. I'm sure if I took away my moms cable remote, and gave her a ATV with OTT streaming she would ninja star the remote through the TV within 15 minutes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Left for android back when the S7 edge came out. Had said S7 edge, note 7, and V20 since then. Never really had any complaints about the battery life, but there was no way I could make it through a day without charging any of them. 

Yesterday I was waiting for a call, and had nothing to do but play around with my new phone for hours. Never plugged it in, and got home with 30% left. 

So far I am getting close to iPad levels of battery life. I don't recall my IPhone 6, or 6+ being anywhere near this good. 

I really was anticipating moving to the S8 in a few months, but if it stays like this I may just stick with iOS. The locked down home screen UI, and lack of app drawer is still maddening though lol.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a pristine BMW e91 wagon, that is way to nice for my lifestyle. I don't want to let my dog in it, or put sporting goods inside. Time for a SUV. 

Main goal is reliability, and $10,000 is the top of my budget. 

Right now there seem to be quite a few cherry 3rd gens including one TRD supercharged one in that price range. 

Gonna check this out tomorrow

http://honolulu.craigslist.org/oah/cto/5926114105.html


Going to 4th gen still nets you a pretty decent one but maybe a bit rougher around the edges. 

I notice a lot of the third gens mention the timing belt, and starter. Is that a real common failure? Is going for the supercharger more trouble then it is worth? 

If I really just prioritize low maintenance ownership what is the best year/trim etc. Aesthetically I like the third gen better, but the interior on the fourth looks like a nicer place to be. Whichever one I get will receive a new stereo leveling kit, and some AT tires. 


Thanks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a original ps4,and this has been a issue from day one. When I watch Netflix, Hulu, and now PS View through ps4 the quality is noticeably different then all my other devices,Aplle tv, Nvidia shield, built in apps etc. 

The picture has a kind of hazy softness to it. Kinda made me nuts before,but I just upgraded to a huge 4k tv, and the difference is stark. I was watching a NBAgame today,and had to switch over to my shield since it was so low quality. 

Games run fine,i have extremely fast internet, and am connected Ethernet right to router. I get about 100 on the internal sppedtest.  No other device I own has this problem. 

Anyone else? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have had a 55 inch 4k tv for a few years now. It has served me well, but after watching a movie on a friend's 75 inch Samsung I am having so size envy. 

Unfortunately i do not have $4000 to spend. Looking in the $1000-1500 range, and there are quite a few 65 inch displays in that segment.

 I was pretty set on grabbing a Sony from BB for $1000. Then I saw that Costco has a 70 inch Vizio with some basic local dimming for the same price. 

Those 5 inches don't sound like much but a 70 is way bigger then a 65, and I really want that imax experience in my living room. 

The BB guy was trying to convince me to go up to $1500 on a HDR 65 inch Sony.  It did look marginally better but I am not a picture quality whore. I watched the Vizio for a good 15 minutes and I am satisfied with the colors. 

Any advice? Will I regret not going for a high end set? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am toying with replacing my iMac with a monitor, to use as a docking station. My GF has been taking over use of my MBP,  so I am considering adding a 2016 to my fleet. It would actually be nice to have it so either of us could just roll up and plug in if we need to work on a big screen. 

We use the iMac as our kitchen tv, so I would like more inputs then just tb3. I would plug in a Chromecast ultra to pair with my Google home for voice activated music so I need HDMI 2.0 for hdcp. 

27 inches is actually a bit small for my needs since I watch while cooking from about 15 feet away. Would prefer 32. 4k is fine. 

I think I could get away with a tv instead of a monitor if I could get a solid 4k60 picture. I would just leave a adapter with all the peripheral plugged in, for the one cable solution. Has anyone had luck plugging a 2016 mbp into a 4k tv? </TEXT>

I am on JOD, but I understand tmo is allowing even eip customer to return for any phone. I have already owned a S7 edge, and really liked it. It was 90% of the note 7, and had waterproofing,Sd card, amazing camera performance, and exceptional battery life. All 3 are top of  my list. 

Of the current phones on the market for T-Mobile, besides the iPhone 7, and S7 I'm not seeing much else that looks good. I don't want to go back to iPhone since it is incompatible with my smart watches, but getting another S7 seems boring. 

What are you planning on doing? </TEXT>

<TITLE> White fly problem seems out of hand. Solutions? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've got a small garden in town, but staying on top of the white flies is a losing position. I've tried dish soap, using neem oil, also cutting and bagging and tossing the affected areas, and tried plain water blasting. but can't get it low enough to allow for peppers or other tasty things to grow. I've planted rosemary but wondering if citronella plants might discourage them. Any advice ? I'm down for trying some serious pesticides at this point since the natural path doesn't seem to be working. What might be the best ones for white fly?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Getting pretty annoyed with the note 7 replacement procedure. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-01 00:56:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just got back into the country after being away since late August. It was a pretty nail-biting experience doing lots of traveling with the note 7. Every plane I got on announced it was illegal to use, and every time I plug it in it tells me to power it down and exchange it. 

I figured by now this would be at least partially resolved. However every single store in the Honolulu metro area has a wait list over 100 peoplle long, and the phones are coming at a trickle. 

I tried calling 611 to just order a replacement, they instructed me to call Samsung. After 45 minutes on the phone with Samsung they dumped me into a hold que for T-Mobile 611. 

Very frustrating. Anyone have any insight on how to get a replacement phone without jumping through all these hoops? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Happened to my travel companion 2 weeks ago in Venice Italy. Last minute air bnb cancelation forced him to look for a room. Books through expedia at a rate of $135 per night. Gets confirmation email with his rate.

After a bad day of traveling he finally gets to hotel at 2am. Checks in, and then receives a invoice for $1,650.

Calls expedia, they tell him to pound sand. Calls his CC they say there is nothing they can do since he check ed in.

<TEXT> Leaving tonight for Europe and called to see if promotion has ended for high speed data. Rep tried to sell me on T-Mobile one (shadily neglecting to inform me of hotspot, and HD video drawbacks). 

According to documents she had Infront of her, T-Mobile one users will be able to connect unlimited at the highest speed available from their roaming partners. 

This so far is the only tantalizing aspect of T-Mobile one for me. As a frequent international traveler this would be awesome. No more searching for local sims. 

I tried to just buy a data pass but apparently they have been taken out of the system. I wonder if this may apply to older plans.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Quick question about temporary unlock protocol. I am traveling abroad on September 1st -28th. Unfortunately T-Mobile summer data roaming will have just expired in Europe. I am set to receive my note today, but am weighing my options. I have my S7e permanently unlocked, and would be able to use local sims if I so choosed. 

Would T-Mobile grant me a temporary unlock so soon on a new device? Or would I be better off ordering again after I return from my trip? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a huge family gathering in BC for the past 2 weeks. I am the only person on TMO in my family. They all looked at the prices for international on ATT, and Verizon, and decided it would be unaffordable to get plans for everyone, my BIL caved in halfway, and spent $120 for 800 MB of data from ATT.

Meanwhile I was just cruising looking up maps, uploading videos to FB, streaming music, and youtube. Not a care in the world. At a few points I even had my hotspot on, and was hosting all of their phones on my data plan. 

Pretty sure Tmobile will have a few new customers after this trip. 

No point to this post except for a thank you to the awesome customer focused attributes of Team Magenta. 

Here is to hoping the extend the Europe promotion, as I land on september 2nd for a trip.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Terrible call quality on OP3 </TITLE>

<TEXT> Just received my OP3 for my gf. Since receiving she has been having atrocious call quality, constantly getting digital clipping and, audio drops. Never had this issue before, and the mobile data is working fine. 

I turned off VOLTE but still having issues. This is most prevalent in the area around her office, but honestly that is the only time she is making calls for the most part. 

Getting this phone necessitated, an new sim. Could that be the issue? T-Mobile couldnt really help much, and said as far as they know everything is fine in the area. The phone is indicating 3-4 bars. There is no wifi in her office so it is not a wifi calling issue. 

Any ideas? She loves the phone, and I would hate to have to send it back. However it does need to function as a phone.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going on a few trips overseas this year. I know Canada is covered with LTE, so I should have no problems. I will be in EU for 27 days, and I am apprehensive to say the least. 

This will be my first trip with a locked phone in quite a while. I tried out the free data on a trip last year and couldn't handle how slow it was. Ended up buying a local sim. I know after 27 days I will need to have at least a period of Fast data. 

T-Mobile's international LTE rates are still quite high as compared to buying local Sim cards. Are my only options to buy a unlock phone strictly for this purpose or is there some way I can get a temporary unlock?

I really want to use my S7e, I also want to have a few GB of fast data to play with. Any options? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a s7 edge. This issue is driving me pretty nuts. The volume output from Bluetooth is extremely low. I have this issue across a wide range of BT devices I own, Bose BT speaker, Plantronics BT head phones, even my car stereo is noticiably lower volume as compared to the radio, or a local mp3. I know that is is isolated to my Android phone, my iphone 6s+ had no issues with any of these devices, and they are from reputable companies, capable of going loud. Even my company s4 will drive the speakers louder.

I have searched around on Google to no avail, and downloaded about 6-7 different apps from play store, that purport to raise volume.None of them helped at all. 

So is there anyway to tweak the volume?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am admittedly a bro and this is my mini take on HH
This movie is a instant cult classic, and the best super hero movie I have seen in years.
Every once in a while something cool actually slips through the cracks in cinema, and challenges the status quo.
Despite the 50% tomatometer. Mark my words this film will be hugely influential in coming years. People in the know will realize that a lot of cues are lifted wholesale from this movie in upcoming action flicks. This movie breaks new ground in badassery.


I know, I know... This movie is hugely influenced by cut scenes of FPS. It is a collection of tropes, and is derivate. However this is a love letter to single player campaigns, parkour, and disembowelment. It would make a damn good video game premise on its own.


Still the full commitment brick on the gas pedal, embrace of the genre, makes this instantly my favorite video game movie of all time, despite not adapting any specific franchise.


Just as raid redemption changed the whole game for action movies and made it OK to kick ass again, this movie comes along and ramps everything up to max volume. Maximum tits, maximum caved in heads, maximum explosions. A 12 year old boys fever dream appearing like a mirage up on the screen. Leaving the grown men in the audience with me alternately shiting their pants, and giggling like school girls.


I fucking loved this movie.

<TEXT> Been to Europe many times before. When I am left to my devices planning a trip I always gravitate towards, a culturally enriching, romantic getaway. This has lead to some awkward circumstances with my bro friends. 

Last time we were in Paris, and my friend asked me "is this a date" as we took our romantic river cruise down the Seine. 

This time will be different! I am charged with showing my bro a good time for 8 days of debauchery on his first trip to Europe, in mid September 2016, and God dammit I want to make sure he doesn't think I am waiting for the right time to pop the question. 

Caveats: we are both pretty fancy, and firmly into "hello fellow kids" mid 30s. So puke stained never ending EDM dorm hostel is not what I am looking for. 

Just wondering what a good reliable trip would be if your main goal was strictly to have a rowdy time. So far I am leaning 4 days Amsterdam, and 4 more days in London. However world is my oyster money is no object, and I am open to anything. 

TL:Dr where would you take your male buddy if your SOs gave you carte' Blanche to run wild in Europe for 8 days unsupervised.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The iPad "pro" is really ostensibly the air 3. While making 32 GB the base memory is long overdue, raising the entry price by $100 is putting it a bit out of my splurge budget. It is a interesting decision by Apple to combat slowing tablet sales, by slapping a new name on a product and raising the price 20%. 

I realize that there are a few new features, and technology's included but this still seems like a greedy move, that will keep margins high, but  over all will greatly reduce their sales. 

Oh well I guess I will stick with my perfectly functional original air. I'm sure I am not alone in my ascertation.  </TEXT>

Does google have some precached cdn with all the play store apps locally, or is ookla under rating the speed?

However if history is any guide then come September apple will roll out something must have in the iPhone 7.

<TEXT> I'm beginning  to realize that I am a recovering alcoholic. Up until finding this sub and starting my new healthy lifestyle, I was drinking 5-10 drinks every single night, and then way more on the weekends. It was out of control and I was always fat lethargic and sick. 

Good friend is moving away soon. Went to a early going away party with the boys last night. Haven't touched a drop of booze since New Years. Saved up a bunch of calories all week for last night. Ended up having six drinks total, and eating my first slice of bread in 6 weeks. 

I feel so awful today, my face is all puffy, and my body is aching. I cannot wait for this to pass, and go back to my healthy ways. I also factored in calories for recovery day so I went and ate my favorite pho for my cheat meal. 

In the past a night of partying would have sent me off the rails and had me hitting the bottle again, but this time feels different. No matter how crap I feel my fat ass is running 5 miles tonight, and will be back in the gym tomorrow. 

No real point to this thread but I am just feeling happy that I am more attached to my healthy lifestyle then my old life at the bars. I also am glad that I had a fun night out with a moderate amount of alcohol instead of ending up shitfaced like usual. 

SV indeed one step at a time.  </TEXT>

I could eat nothing but 10 cans of tuna per day I suppose, but that is not practical. My only other choices would be eggs, or lots of processed protein powders.

I have been getting in around 100 g protein per day, and have been eating a low carb, but high vegetable diet. At around 1500 calories per day. So far the weight has been begrudgingly coming off. I want to lose about 60 more lbs, in a fairly aggressive amount of time for a occasion, but I don't want to be skinny fat, at the end.

I'm wondering if I should shift to a higher protein intake, and if that would accelerate the loss. I really like my veggies, and fruit though.

Are the processed protein bars, and powders really actually good for weight loss? I have lots of them laying around from my training, but I associate them more with bulking. Reading the label on my GNC protein jug, it says one scoop is 200 calories for 20 g protein so to get to 1:1 body weight I would be looking at 2,600 calories, and 13 scoops per day.

Any insight would be appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really enjoy drinking. I drank almost every day in 2015, a lot of days just a beer or 2, but settled into a rhythm of drinking 2 big glasses of bourbon every night. I really didn't have many ill effects, I was breaking personal records in the gym, and maintaining a active lifestyle. However the beer really took its toll on me recently when a injury had me home for a few months. Gained almost 30 lbs from 9-2015 to 12-2015 partying all the time, and shoveling food into my mouth. 

I have gone a few weeks without a drink at this point, and the weight is starting to come off. I don't feel like there was any revelation putting down the bottle though, am I missing something? I am a alcoholic I accept that, is it because I haven't hit rock bottom, and destroyed my life that I am pretty ambivalent about not drinking, and to be completely honest looking forward to sipping some vodka sodas once I lose this weight I gained. 

I am at a bit of a crossroads in life. Mid 30s, obese, but still eat, and drink like I have the metabolism of a 20 year old. Really the only thing I don't like about drinking is the getting fat part. 

I know that it is bad for me, but should I fell more guilty for being ok with my functional alcoholism? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have data stash. Watching hours of video is not a priority for me. However I read a lot of blogs, and like to watch the embedded videos. As far as I can tell when watching embedded videos on iOS the do not have a mechanism, to downgrade video to lower quality they stream at 1080p all the time. 

I switched to T-Mobile the day binge on went live, and ever since I have never been able to watch a HD embedded video without a huge amount of stuttering. I just ran a speed test on my phone and got around 35 mbps down. Then I go to watch a video and allowing it to buffer for 15 seconds yields me about 5 seconds of video. 

If I watch on the YouTube app the same video streams with no issues at 480p. I can only assume that T-Mobile is capping my video at 1.5mbps even though I do not have binge on. Is there any way to turn this off?

It is really frustrating because I want to watch videos from CES but I get nothing but buffering. 480p may be ok for some, but it looks like crap on my 6s plus.  </TEXT>

However I can't help but wonder what type of impact this story would have had on both defendants if it came out earlier. Especially at the time that the high powered attorneys were going for a second trial. 

Now they are both sitting there with no appeals left, and nothing barring a moonshot federal court case will free them. 

Anyone know why they waited so long, after dedicating so much time to film? No distribution deal, wrong climate at the time.

<TEXT> The thing that stuck with me throughout the second half of the show was this quote from the nephew. Sorry not sure what episode but the context was him on the phone with his mom calling from jail, after changing his mind on admitting guilt. He was saying that he wasn't involved, and said as an aside that he was only there for the fire. 

For some reason the way he said it really stands out in my mind. It was almost as if he was saying that he hadn't done any of the raping or killing, but was there to help burn her body. 

Just finished the series when I should have been in bed hours ago. All said and done I think something stinks about the case. However for some reason I can't stop thinking that he was telling his mom he burned her, and shouldn't be going down for all the other crimes, but realizes the whole he dug, and can't articulate a middle ground.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Certainly not nearly as bad as the previous reboot, but I felt like it came off really flat. After seeing the exciting, and very well paced reboot of Star Trek, I was really exited for Abrams take one SW. Especially considering ST, has always been a bit headier, and slower paced then SW. I really think that the script played it safe, and was lacking wit. The acting was typically bad for a SW movie, the cgi was terrible (especially the main villain), and the action sequences were pretty formulaic. 

We will see once the other 2 come out, if this movie was just laying the groundwork for better things to come. However I can't say that my enthusiasm hasn't been dampened.  </TEXT>

This has really been breaking me down, and really tearing away all the hard work I had done physically, and mentally. I have gained back all the weight I lost and then some, haven't stepped foot in the gym for months. I am walking around as just a shell of a person.

<TEXT> I am currently employed in a high paying job that is making me miserable. I was able to maneuver my way into this position from a totally unrelated field in the company. My only issue is that I am not 100% qualified to be here. Despite my years of experience, and good references from people as high as the ceo, I'm sure I would have issues landing a similar job elsewhere. 

As it stands right now I have had a total of 6 days off since July 4th, and am routinely required to put in 70-80 hour weeks. It is unsustainable for me, and is making me gain weight, and really straining my relationship with my girlfriend. 

I have been clocking so much overtime that I have about 2 years of living expenses saved. 

My question is if you were in the position that you wanted a total change in October 2015, and had the means to support your lifestyle for 2 years of study, what would you go for?

Coding, Cisco certifications, network security, X-ray technician? I like to be hands on, and I would not do well in a paper pushing office job. 

I don't have kids so I can adjust my lifestyle to a much lower salary then my current one, but I need a field where work is abundant, and pay starts out no lower then say $40,000.

I am a realist, and I think I would be a terrible parent. I like kids, but that is why I decided to be CF. I have a really short fuse, and a bad temper. I go through manic depression. I drink (way)more then I should. 


Pretty much I am the problem, not the kids. My fear is that if I ever had kids, I would neglect them, or worse verbally abuse them when I had a bad day. Or worse yet just disappear, and leave my SO to raise them.


As it stands now I am a successful person, I keep my GF happy, and haven't managed to kill my dog. I project a very level headed, mellow persona, so people light heartedly ask when I am having kids. I usually tell them some BS like "none yet but it's fun trying"

However deep down, I know I would be a asshole of a father, so I just did my future kids a favor, and got a vasectomy.
I'm wondering if anyone else has the same feelings? This is a dark secret of mine, and I should have used a throw away but oh well.

<TITLE> What impact does a speedtest have on realworld throughput? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-29 12:05:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> At this moment in time I have both a fiber 100mbps connection, and a cable 300mbps connection at my house. (Yes I did load balance them, because I'm a nerd). I recently ordered the 300, and was really excited to have 3x the speed of fiber for the same price.

If you go by the speedtest.net results everything is as it should be. Ookla says I am getting 330mbps down, vs the as advertised 100 from fiber.

However in the real world my 100 mbps connection runs circles around the 300. Anywhere besides speedtest.net I get faster downloads. Torrents come down way faster, and my 300 connection actually has a hard time streaming 4k, whereas the fiber fills up the buffer in seconds.

What gives?

Is speedtest.net just a conspiracy, by the ISPs? They are definitely unscrupulous if they allow ads for known malware, like mackeeper. What good is all this speed to speedtest.net if regular websites never see nearly the same bandwidth?

Any thoughts? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Pitted the Hawaiian Telcom fiber 100 vs the oceanic 300 maxx upgrade. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-28 23:32:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have noticed a common theme in posts on r/hawaii are about the 2 major ISPs here.  I thought some might be interested in a head to head comparison. 

I had oceanic come over and install the highest tier plan at my house yesterday. I already had the hawaiian Telcom 100 package, but my promotion is going to end soon. Oceanic offered 300 for $59.99 per month for 1 year. I currently pay $59.99 for 100 through HT. 

A bit of a description of my setup. I have last years top of the line asus Ac router, and run hard wired either net to my iMac, and to a switch hooked up to my 4k Samsung TV/ ps4/ Apple TV. Pretty much ideal setup for testing actual speed in a real world environment, since gigabit either net eliminates the variables of wifi. 

How did it perform?

Speed tests:

Well the good news is that to speedtest.net I managed to get above the advertised speed, clocking a blazing highest speed of close to 330mbps. Also hitting other twc servers in the mainland provided excellent results exceeding 200mbps in most instances. 

Unfortunately that is where the great speeds ended. It has been a open secret that many ISPs prioritize data to ookla, and the graphs really show it. When it detects speedtest.net traffic you can see the graph shoot up. 

I prefer to use a broad range of other speed tests to get a better idea. My favorite being testmy. Pitting ht vs oceanic in all the other speed tests put ht in the lead most of the time. To be fair ht also never got anywhere close to the advertised 100mbps, but I also never saw a result lower then 30mbps, whereas I saw many tests in the 10-15mbps with oceanic. 

Real world observable speed:

To test this I did a few different high bandwidth tests for things I do on a day to day basis. HD streaming, downloading games, and torrenting movies are the 3 things that stress your connection the most. 

 I am a early adopter of 4k, and use it wherever I can. Both my tv and imac are capable of streaming 4k natively, and at times it takes over 20mbps for just one stream. 

On my tv Netflix allows you to see the resolution up in the corner. Starting out with oceanic it would go 720p, then after a minute 1080p, then finally would get to 4k. 

Hawaiian Telcom starts out in 4k right off the bat. 

On my iMac hard wired in. I went to a 4k 60fps clip on YouTube.  Oceanic would play it but the status bar was barely keeping up with the white buffer bar, and over a few clips it had stopped multiple times to catch up. 

Did the same test with ht. no issues whatsoever. The buffer filled up, and stayed there the whole time. 

Downloading programs. 

For this I downloaded the same program from apple to my iMac twice. 

Oceanic seemed to be downloading at a rate of about 1.5 MB per second over the life of a 2GB download. 

Ht was about 2or so MB per second. 

Neither was very impressive but ht again took the win. 

Torrents

Not even close at all. Best observed speed from the most seeded torrent on the Internet at the moment(1080p mad max rip). 

Oceanic 3.5 MBps
Ht 7MBps

Conclusion. 

Ht was hands down faster in every aspect. There are many variables out of my control for this test. However I made the oceanic guy run a new drop to my house, and new home run coax to my 6183 modem. He said that all numbers were picture perfect. I ran every test back to back on the same equipment with the only variable being the ISP. 

I will be returning the modem, and canceling the oceanic account. For most people it would be fine, but if you want the best then HT fiber wins this round.

Mid range. Not a big gamer, but would probably want to run GTA V at 1080p.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

Under $1,000 all in

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

USA (Hawaii limits my shipping options)

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp)**

GPU with HDMI 2.0

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

Hey guys hope I filled out the format the right way. I am a total noob, but am good with building things. Considering my options to accomplish a few simple tasks. I want a PC permanently running connected to my 4k tv. I don't have cable, and I'm steadily amassing streaming devices. I just want to cut to the chase and have a HTPC to "aquire" content and watch it at my leisure, instead of my current process of getting it on one computer moving it to plex streaming dlna etc.

I know that at this moment getting a GPU with hdmi 2.0 is expensive, but I would need it to run 4k at 60hz on my tv. I would also like one that had display port as well. I am considering replacing my 27 inch iMac with this PC, and a 36 inch 4k monitor. I would fish a long usb, and display port cable to my kitchen. If the GPU could handle dual 4k desk tops that would be a plus.

I also need a mini case no taller then 18 inches, and no deeper then 14 it can be wide though, as its going on a shelf.

Gaming, and aesthetics are behind budget. This will be a utilitarian build.

Thanks in advance

**NOTE: You do not have to follow this format, but please be sure to answer these questions. Please do not ask to simply be given a build. You are welcome to delete this section.** </TEXT>

<TITLE> Extremely slow downloads from PSN on fast internet connection. </TITLE>

<TEXT> I was wondering if this was just a issue for me or everyone else. When I buy a game from PSN it takes a insane amount of time to download. I just bought walking dead which is a 4 GB game. It says ready in 17 hours. I can torrent 4 GB in well under a half hour with my 150 mbps internet. Downloading GTA was over 24 hours.


My Ps4 and router are in the same room. I thought it could be a wifi issue even though I have a nice AC router. So I just spent my day fishing a cat 5 directly to the PS4 through my attic. Did a speed test  in the system menu. I got around 95mbps, but still running slow. I bought the game after, and got 17 hours.

Any ideas on why so slow? The only other thing that indicates a slow connection is if I click on a trailer it will start out in 240p, and take about 1 minute until it ramps up to 1080p. I assume the trailers also come from PSN. Watching netflix/IGN/etc is flawless. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My SUV (Infiniti) has been developing some weird erratic acceleration lately. It is beyond my ability to diagnose it. Anyone know of a good mechanic in town, preferably in the Ward area, who could take a look at it? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Can we do some sort of petition or a change.org to get a Ikea here? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Seriously Every time I go home, I wander the hallowed halls of Ikea, and just imagine how cherry my house would be if we had one. If Target', Walmart, Costco, Home Depot etc can make it work I'm sure Ikea could pull it off.

I know they need certain demographics to build a store. Lets see a entire island of people living in tiny spaces, with a pretty high average yearly household income per capita. Not to mention the fact that it is such a transient place. If we aren't their demographic I don't know who is. 

They won't even ship us a catalog let alone buy the super concentrated awesomeness that is swedish meat balls, and minimalist Scandinavian furniture. 

I tried contacting their offices. 0 response.

Anyone know of a way to collect some signatures and get their attention? </TEXT>
