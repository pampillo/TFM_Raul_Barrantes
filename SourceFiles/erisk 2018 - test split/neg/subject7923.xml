<TEXT> Here's the recipe. This cake had 6 components. The actual cake, whipped cream frosting/filling, macarons (shells + lazy custard/ ganache filling), white chocolate drip, and the sail.  
 nbsp;  
**1. Sponge** [makes three 200g 6-inch cake layers]  
112g cake flour  
1 tsp baking powder  
1/4 tsp salt  
5 large eggs, separated  
156 g granulated sugar  
8 g matcha powder  
60 g whole milk  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven at 400F. Line baking pan with parchment paper on bottom and grease the sides of the pan if you don't have nonstick.  
2. Whisk together sifted flour, matcha, baking powder, and salt.  
3. In a different, large bowl, whisk egg yolks, sugar, and milk until pale.  
4. Separately, whisk egg whites until medium stiff peaks.  
5. Add dry mixture to wet mixture and fold together. Then slowly fold in the medium stiff egg whites. I usually add 1/3 of the meringue first to make the batter light, then fold in the remaining egg whites.    
6. Pour batter onto the baking sheet and then rap the sheet down a few times to release any big air bubbles.  
7. Bake for 25 minutes (maybe a bit less) ([a toothpick should go in and out cleanly].  
8. Bang the cake down and then flip over onto somewhere to cool. The cake should have receded from the edges so it should plop right out.  Remove parchment paper and then once it cools enough to hold it's own, wrap in plastic wrap and fast cool in the fridge.    
 nbsp;  
**2. (Ube) Stabilized Whipped Cream Frosting:**  
570 g heavy whipping cream  
25 g powdered sugar (might need more)  
3 g ube extract  
 nbsp;  
50 g clear piping gel (*see below for recipe if you don't have any*)    
 nbsp;    *60 g water*  
 nbsp;    *30 g cornstarch*  
 nbsp;    *150 g light corn syrup*  
 nbsp;  
1. Whenever whipping your own cream, make sure the first thing you do is throw your bowl and whisk attachment into the fridge or freezer. Cold is your best friend.  
2. If you don't have clear piping gel, make some. There are other ways to stabilize a whipped cream, but I just discovered this and I really like it. Add water and cornstarch and whisk until there are no lumps. Then add and whisk in the corn syrup.  
3. Heat over medium, stirring every so often. It should bubble and turn into a hair gel consistency. Cool to room temperature.  
3. Take out chilled bowl and whisk the powdered sugar and cream together until soft peaks.  
4. Whisking at a fast speed, add in 50 g of the clear piping gel (whisk it up a bit before adding it in).  
5. Whisk until stiff peaks and is well incorporated.  
6. Put 250 g of the stabilized whipped cream into a different bowl and fold in the ube extract.  
 nbsp;  
**3.1. Macaron Shells:**  *For about 10 1.5 inch macarons:*  
46 g almond flour (sift, no big almond pieces)  
43 g powdered sugar    
35 g egg whites (room temp)  
25 g granulated sugar  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven to 325F. Measure out and sift your powdered sugar and almond flour. Whisk together and set aside.  
2. Make your meringue. I speed warm up my egg whites by putting them in a small container and then putting that container in a bowl with hot water. Takes about 5 min to bring up the temp and doesn't cook them.  
Beat/ whisk your egg whites until frothy and start to incorporate the granulated sugar a bit a time. Beat until stiff peaks.   
3. Macaronage. Look up on Youtube if you're unfamiliar on how to do so.   
Fold about half your dry ingredients into the meringue until just incorporated and then add the rest and continue folding until just incorporated. Now would be the time to add food coloring. Gel or powder, not liquid. In this case, I split the batter into two and added green food coloring to one and purple to the other. Fold until you get a lava like consistency. Fold by scraping along the edge of the bowl to deflate the meringue a bit and then scooping the batter. Repeat. You should be able to pick up the spatula and have the batter fall down in a ribbon. The ribbon should incorporate back into the main blob after about 10ish seconds. If it doesn't fall correctly, I do a few more folds. Put into a piping bag with a tip.  
4. Pipe out your macarons. I use a silpat (would highly recommend). Rap the baking sheet against the table a few times.  Pop any air bubbles with a toothpick and swirl the toothpick around a bit to have that hole close up.     
5. I hate waiting for the shells to dry, so I cheat and dry the shells using the oven heat. I do this by opening the oven and holding the tray in the oven, rotating it every 10 seconds or so for about a minute. My hands usually get hot at that point. I take them out for about a minute. Then back in again, rotating, for another 30 seconds. This quickly dries out the shells and makes a skin without having to wait 30 minutes at room temp (especially if it's humid!) :p.   
You want to be able to touch the shell and have it not be sticky. Make sure it doesn't shine and you're probably good to go.   
6. Bake for 9 minutes at 315 and drop to 300 for another 9 minutes. (The macarons worked out well using these parameters, but all ovens are different, so you have to do a bit of your own troubleshooting .)  
 nbsp;  
**3.2. Lazy Custard/ish Ganache Filling:** *ube/ matcha*  
1 large egg yolk  
9.25 g corn starch  
85 g milk  
25 g sugar  
~1ish gram of either ube extact or matcha powder  
25 g white chocolate  
 nbsp;  
1. Combine egg yolks and cornstarch until fully incorporated.  
2. In a saucepan, high heat, combine milk and sugar. If you're just doing one flavor for the custard, incorporate it now.  
3. Bring to boil and remove from heat.  
4. While whisking constantly, slowly add to bowl with yolks and cornstarch. You are tempering the egg yolks so that they won't scramble.  
5. Return the mixture to the saucepan on high heat.  
6. Bring to rolling boil, while whisking/ mixing constantly. The mixture will become custard like. Normally I don't like my custards to be in the pan for super long, but I wanted to get lots of liquid out so I kept it on the heat until it was very thick.  
7. To get rid of lumps in your custard you can either sieve it through a fine mesh or use a hand blender (works like magic!). Or you might not have any lumps to begin with and then you're all set.  
8. Add the white chocolate to the warm custard and stir in.  
9. Divide custard into two parts and then stir in respective flavoring.  
9. Add custard/ ganache into a piping bag with a small tip.  
 nbsp;  
**4. Ube White Chocolate Drip:**  
50 g white chocolate  
30 g heavy cream  
a few grams of ube extract  
 nbsp;  
1. Start to melt the white chocolate over a double boiler.  
2. In a small pot, add the cream and the ube extract and stir until it begins to simmer. Once it does, add to the bowl with white chocolate.  
3. Stir until melted and then cool. Add to a piping bag with a tip around the size of the drips your want.  
4. I initially tried a different recipe using 1:1 of chocolate: cream but that was too runny and had to go back and melt in more white chocolate.  
 nbsp;  
**5. White Chocolate Sail:**  
100 g white chocolate  
 nbsp;  
1. So this is only white chocolate. Start to melt on a double boiler and take off when most of the white chocolate is melted.  
2. Stir until fully melted and let cool slightly.  
3. Pour onto a piece of parchment paper and spread with a spatula, relatively evenly and not too thin.    
4. With the edges of the parchment paper, form 'waves'. Online people use clips to maintain these shapes. I didn't have any so I just held it until it set, which didn't take too long.  
5. As soon as it sets enough to hold its own, place into the fridge to fully harden.  
 nbsp;  
**Assembly:**
1. I just bought a spinny table thing. I used that and it was super helpful.  
2. Even up your cake layers if you want with a cake leveler of a bread knife.  
3. Place your first layer down onto a cake board or plate and add some ube whipped cream on top.  
4. Repeat until you don't have any cake layers left. Press down a bit and even out the sides a bit. I briefly cooled it in the fridge.  
5. Add globs of the non ube whipped cream now, careful not to mix it with the ube whipped cream filling and spread it around. This is where the spinny table really came in handy.  
6. To even out the whipped cream after I had it mostly even, I used a metal cake scaper that I briefly heated with a blow torch. It smooths out the whipped cream very nicely.  
7. Once the whipped cream is done, put in the fridge or freezer.  
8. Assemble macarons by piping the fillings in. 
9. Carefully remove the parchment paper from the bottom of the sail and then paint it with food coloring/vodka dilution of your choice. I tried using matcha powder. Meh. Gold dust always works though.  
10. Take out the cooled cake and add the drips. It doesn't matter too much how you do it, just try to vary the amount you squeeze out a location.    
11. Finally add the sail and macarons. I also added some piped out ube whipped cream and matcha powder.   
 nbsp;  
*Additional Notes:*  
1. Assemble and frost your cake before making the drip. Otherwise the drip will harden before you have time to use it.  
2. Taste the whipped cream early. I didn't add enough powdered sugar and majorly regretted it.  
3. Cakes are dumb and take long. Start earlier than 9pm on a week day lol.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lol yeah. . By the time I decided to make macarons, I was too lazy to match the green macarons to the matcha cake. But other than the macarons, the color comes from the matcha or the ube extract. I did try painting with matcha onto the white chocolate sail and that was sort of bad. But again, when it's like 1 something am and you want to sleep. Haha. This is my starting point so I'm sure I'll get better with colors :p. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are a few components here. The choux pastry, the black sesame pastry cream filling, and the glaze (which really is just white chocolate with some food coloring).  
 nbsp;  
**1. Choux pastry: [for about 25-30 4 inch eclairs]**  
200 g water  
125 g milk  
112 g butter (stick, cut into small pieces)  
4 g salt  
4 g sugar  
150 g flour  
4 eggs  
 nbsp;  
1. Preheat oven to 400F.  
2. Add milk, water, butter, sugar, and salt into a saucepan and bring to boil. You want your butter to have melted prior to boiling, so make sure you cut up the stick of butter into small pieces.  
3. Take the saucepan off the heat, and add in the flour. Stir in (wooden spoon is best) the flour until everything comes together into a ball.  
4. Return to heat and stir vigorously until you start to see some dried residue on the side (~2-3 minutes). Sometimes if I'm not sure, I just stir for longer. In my experience, having less liquid in that dough hasn't been an issue.  
5. Transfer the dough into a bowl and beat until steam no longer rises. If it's in a stand mixer, until the bowl is no longer hot to the touch. You don't want to scramble your eggs that you're about to incorporate.  
6. One at a time, beat in the eggs. Be patient and don't add them all at once.  
7. Dough/ batter should now be a bit droopy. Add to a piping bag with a very large round tip.  
8. Pipe a short line onto a silpat or parchment paper (though, silpats are awesome and everyone should use them).  
9. Grab a small bowl of water and using your finger dipped in water, flatten all the points which resulted from piping them. Those little points will burn in the oven, so flatten those and any other pointy edges which may be on your silpat.  
10. Bake until the eclairs are golden brown (~30 minutes). Opening the oven/ taking them out before this will cause them to collapse on themselves. You want the puffs to form a solid structure.  
11. After a light golden brown, I take out the tray and stab holes in the bottom (I did on the side, but you often see people do 2 or three holes on the bottom) of all the eclairs using a chopstick. I'm sure there are better ways to do this.    
12. I drop the temp down to 300ish F and put the chopstick stabbed choux back into the oven to allow the insides to dry out. Usually I leave them in for another 15 minutes. I eat a sample one and if it's still doughy inside, I leave it for longer.  
13. Let cool.  
 nbsp;  
**Black Sesame Pastry Cream:**    
4 large egg yolks  
37 g cornstarch  
340 g milk  
70 g sugar  
50 g black sesame powder
225 g heavy cream  
6 g powdered sugar  
 nbsp;  
You need to make a custard and a whipped cream. Take your large bowl and whisk that you're going to make the whipped cream with and throw that into the fridge before you begin. You want it cold.  
1. To prepare the black sesame powder, put around 100 g or more black sesame seeds onto a hot frying pan without any oil and toast on low heat, stirring constantly for about 15 minutes.  Grind in a food processor to a powder.  
2. Now prepare the **custard component**. In a large bowl, combine egg yolks and cornstarch thoroughly.  
3. In a saucepan, high heat, combine milk, sugar, and black sesame powder and bring to boil and remove from heat.  
4. While whisking constantly, slowly add to bowl with yolks and cornstarch. You are tempering the egg yolks so that they won't scramble. Don't stop whisking!   
5. Return the mixture to the saucepan on high heat.  
6. Bring to rolling boil, while whisking/ mixing constantly. I actually use my hand blender and constantly mix while it's on the stove. The mixture will become custard like.  
7. If you did a good job mixing, you don't need to sieve, but if you see lumps, then sieve through a fine mesh into a bowl and then cover the bowl with cling wrap. Make sure to press it directly onto the custard to avoid condensation.  
8. Chill.  
9. Now prepare **whipped cream** component.  Take out the chilled bowl, whisk, and cream. 
10. Add cream and powdered sugar and whisk until firm peaks. Feel free to add some black sesame powder here if you want more.    
11. Take out black sesame custard and whisk a bit to loosen it up. Add a small amount of whipped cream to lighten the mixture even more.  
12. Slowly fold in the rest of the whipped cream, making sure not to overfold (will deflate the cream).  
13. Place into a piping bag with a tip that will fit into the hole you made.   
 nbsp;  
**White Chocolate "Glaze":**  
120 g white chocolate  
tad bit of food coloring  
 nbsp;  
1. Melt white chocolate over a double boiler until just melted.  
2. Add small bit of food coloring and mix.  
 nbsp;  
**Assembly**  
1. First still the eclairs by piping in the pastry cream.  
2. Make sure the white chocolate "glaze" is melted and dip the eclairs, upside down into the bowl.  
3. Use a spatula to even it out if need be.  
4. Add other chocolate or black sesame powder to garnish.  
5. Serve immediately. They don't sit well for more than a few hours because the choux will absorb the pastry cream and lose its crunchiness.  
6. Enjoy!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see things on Insta that sometimes give me inspiration for my desserts and try to combine different components. And I really like Asian flavors so I tend to gravitate towards those.

<TEXT> Could be due to many many factors. Overmixing, undermixing, wrong temp of your oven, wrong ratio of almond flour to egg whites to sugar, humidity. BASICALLY, every variable can go wrong. lol. What does not macarony mean? Like exploded shell? That's from not resting long enough. If it completely collapsed on itself, could be multiple factors. Undermixing is sometimes my culprit. If it was thin and brittle, that's usually overmixing in my hands. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lol. Well to be 100% honest, I wanted them to be just rose. But I added way too much rose water, so to counteract, I added in some horchata extract (yeah, it's a think..doesn't super taste like it tho). So mostly, the ganache was florally, but subtle notes of horchata. :p. An horchata ganache could easily be done though. Just incorporate that flavor into the cream before adding to the white chocolate! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mmkay. Recipe is below. A few things: I'm actually only going to give you the recipe for 10 macarons. I scaled it up by 2.5x to have enough macarons for this. Also, I suck at ganaches. I always split them so maybe following my recipe for that isn't the best. I think my issue is that the cream is too hot when I add it to the white chocolate. Just a head's up. (Normally recipes will tell you heat up cream and pour that over chopped up chocolate.)    
 nbsp;    
**Macaron Shells:**  *For about 10 1.5 inch macarons:*  
46 g almond flour (sift, no big almond pieces)  
43 g powdered sugar    
35 g egg whites (room temp)  
25 g granulated sugar  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven to 325F. Measure out and sift your powdered sugar and almond flour. Whisk together and set aside.  
2. Make your meringue. I speed warm up my egg whites by putting them in a small container and then putting that container in a bowl with hot water. Takes about 5 min to bring up the temp and doesn't cook them.  
Beat/ whisk your egg whites until frothy and start to incorporate the granulated sugar a bit a time. Beat until stiff peaks.   
3. Macaronage. Look up on Youtube if you're unfamiliar on how to do so.   
Fold about half your dry ingredients into the meringue until just incorporated and then add the rest and continue folding until just incorporated. Now would be the time to add food coloring. Gel or powder, not liquid. Fold until you get a lava like consistency. Fold by scraping along the edge of the bowl to deflate the meringue a bit and then scooping the batter. Repeat. You should be able to pick up the spatula and have the batter fall down in a ribbon. The ribbon should incorporate back into the main blob after about 10ish seconds. If it doesn't fall correctly, I do a few more folds. Put into a piping bag with a tip.  
4. Pipe out your macarons. I use a silpat (would highly recommend). Rap the baking sheet against the table a few times.  Pop any air bubbles with a toothpick and swirl the toothpick around a bit to have that hole close up.     
5. I hate waiting for the shells to dry, so I cheat and dry the shells using the oven heat. I do this by opening the oven and holding the tray in the oven, rotating it every 10 seconds or so for about a minute. My hands usually get hot at that point. I take them out for about a minute. Then back in again, rotating, for another 30 seconds. This quickly dries out the shells and makes a skin without having to wait 30 minutes at room temp (especially if it's humid!) :p.   
You want to be able to touch the shell and have it not be sticky. Make sure it doesn't shine and you're probably good to go.   
6. Bake for 9 minutes at 315 and drop to 300 for another 9 minutes. (The macarons worked out well using these parameters, but all ovens are different, so you have to do a bit of your own troubleshooting .)  
 nbsp;  
**Horchata Rose Ganache**          
60 g white chocolate  
30 g heavy cream  
a few dashes of rose water  
a few dashes of horchata extract  
 nbsp;  
1. First of all, yes I know the horchata extract (vs legit horchata) is a sell out. But I had it, so I used it :p.  
2. Put the white chocolate over a double boiler and mostly melt. Take off double boiler when there are a few unmelted pieces remaining.  
3. Heat cream, rose water, and horchata extact in a small saucepan until it reduces to about 20ish ml. If you wanted to use some horchata mixure that would also work. (for my 25 macarons, I used 125 g white chocolate and 40 g cream I think..but ran out at the end and had to fill some very skimpily).  
4. Let cream cool a bit and then add into the white chocolate mixture.  
5. Fold together and transfer to a piping bag and chill for a short while to firm up before piping onto the macaron shells.  
 nbsp;  
***Notes on Painting:***  
1. I used normal Americolor gel food coloring and a paint brush set I use for desserts. I used a big plate as a palette.    
2. My diluent was vodka because it evaporates quickly and causes it to be less sticky than if you use water.  
3. Check out http://imgur.com/a/GLCu9 for progress pictures. You can sort of get a sense of what I did.  
4. I made a template for how I wanted to set it up on Photoshop. This served as my "grid" as a painted them.  
5. I started with a base coat on lots of them with a diluted food coloring. Then went back using less diluted food coloring to make brush strokes.  
 nbsp;  
Overall, was pretty, but a lot of work. As a one off thing, this is pretty chill, but I would never wish this pain upon someone doing this on a regular basis :p.  
If anything, make the macarons because they're tasty!  
Gluck!  </TEXT>

Except with that, I didn't know how I'd replicate the brush strokes... Then I tried using it more like acrylic paint, which was okayish. But yes. Just painting took about 3.5 hrs _.

<TEXT> Lol not sure. I wouldn't wish this on any baker though. haha. Too painful. It would probably be easier to just have a grid of macarons all touching and paint them like that. I wanted a bit of depth/ some on their sides so decided to set it up like that. I do sometimes wonder how much I'd charge, though I haven't really done a cost calculation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the recipe. There are three components: the Thai tea creme brulee (recipe almost the same as Hot Thai Kitchen [changed water and sugar amounts]), a black sesame paste, and coconut and pandan caviar and jellies.  
 nbsp;  
**Thai Tea Creme Brulee:** *4 or 5 small ramekin servings*  
240 g heavy cream  
50 g water  
120 g evaporated mteilk  
40 g Thai tea leaves  
80 g sweetened condensed milk  
4 large egg yolks (~72 g)  
12.5 g granulated sugar  
pinch salt  
a few grams sugar to brulee  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven to 325 F.  
2. In a pot on medium heat, bring whipping cream, water, and evaporated to a boil. Turn off heat, add Thai tea leaves and stir, and let steep for 5 minutes.  
3. In a bowl, whisk sugar, salt, and egg yolks until smooth. Whisk in condensed milk.   
4. Using a fine strainer, slowly add the Thai tea mixture over the yolk/ condensed milk. Whisk constantly.  
5. Strain again and then add into ramekins. It is better to err on the side of shallow vs filling up to the top. Quickly get rid of big bubbles by torching the tops.   
6. Put ramekins onto a sheet pan and then add hot water to fill the pan to about half the height of the ramekin.  
7. Bake for 40-45 minutes. Tap the sides of the ramekins and if it jiggles a lot, it definitely isn't done. But if it only jiggles a little like jello, it is probably fine.  
8. Let cool a little at room temp, then transfer to the fridge. You want them to be completely chilled before bruleeing.  
9. I use a round cutter to take the custard out of the ramekin but that doesn't matter. Add a few grams to the top and spread evenly. Torch slowly until it bubbles and browns a bit.  
 nbsp;  
**Black Sesame Paste:**  
15 g black sesame seeds  
2 g sugar  
40 g heavy cream  
1-5ish g water  
 nbsp;  
1. Grind the seeds to fine pieces with a food processor. Add to a pot with cream and sugar.  
2. Stirring constantly, reduce the mixture down until little cream remains and it is a thick consistency.  
3. Add in water a few g at a time and stir until you like the consistency. FYI, attempting to sieve at this point will release lots of oil. If you processed them well enough, the texture should be fine without needing to sieve.  
 nbsp;  
**Coconut or Pandan Caviar/ Jellies:**  
a small cup of oil, refrigerated  
*Coconut*  
50 g coconut milk  
50 g water  
1 g agar (or whatever setting agent you have)  
10 g sugar  
*Pandan*  
1 g pandan paste  
100 g water  
10 g sugar  
1 g agar  
 nbsp;  
1. Put the oil in the fridge immediately. Or freezer. You want it really really cold.  
2. Add water, sugar, and either coconut milk or pandan paste into a small microwaveable bowl and stir well. I added some white food coloring to the coconut as well. Add the agar powder, stir, and heat up until the agar dissolves. Microwaving for a minute works fine.  
3. Let cool slightly and then transfer 1/3 of the mixture into something that makes droplets. I have a syringe, but you can really use anything that has a nozzle.  
4. Slowly drop the agar mixture droplets into the cup of cold oil. They should start to fall down and resemble a lava lamp and settle on the bottom.  
5. Take the oil + caviar (gel spheres) and strain [I use a fine mesh tea strainer].  Rinse with some water for about 20 seconds to get rid of the oil.  
6. With the other 2/3 of the mixture, pour out onto some cling wrap lining a small pan or container. Let cool (fridge speeds this up) and then you can slice into cubes once it solidifies.  
 nbsp;  
This flavor combo tastes so good together. Enjoy! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mmkay, here's the recipe. It's the French method because I'm 1. lazy and don't like having to do the extra step of making a simple syrup and 2. am stingy and can make a meringue with a small amount of egg whites. With this being said, you can do everything the exact same from one time to the next and end up with hollows. RIP.   
 nbsp;   
**Macaron Shells**  
For about 10 1.5 inch macarons:  
46 g almond flour (sift, no big almond pieces)  
42 g powdered sugar    
35 g egg whites (room temp)  
25 g granulated sugar  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven to 325F. Measure out and sift your powdered sugar and almond flour. Whisk together and set aside.  
2. Make your meringue. I speed warm up my egg whites by putting them in a small container and then putting that container in a bowl with hot water. Takes about 5 min to bring up the temp and doesn't cook them.  
Beat/ whisk your egg whites until frothy and start to incorporate the granulated sugar a bit a time. Beat until stiff peaks.  
3. Macaronage. Look up on Youtube if you're unfamiliar on how to do so.   
For this batter you want to split the batter in two as soon as the ingredients are incorporated. Fold about half your dry ingredients into the meringue until just incorporated and then add the rest and continue folding until just incorporated. Split the batter into two and add food gel food coloring. Individually, fold until you get a lava like consistency. Fold by scraping along the edge of the bowl to deflate the meringue a bit and then scooping the batter. Repeat. You should be able to pick up the spatula and have the batter fall down in a ribbon. The ribbon should incorporate back into the main blob after about 10ish seconds. If it doesn't fall correctly, I do a few more folds. Put each batter into its own piping bag with no tip. Then put these two bags into a singular bag with a tip (so a bag with a tip containing two bags of different color macaron batters).   
4. Pipe out your macarons. I treat this like any normal bag of macaron batter. When you squeeze from the top, both colors will incorporate into the tip and then when you lift up, exaggerate the swirl you do at the end (you normally do a little one to avoid those little bumps). I use a silpat (would highly recommend). Rap the baking sheet against the table a few times.  Pop any air bubbles with a toothpick and swirl the toothpick around a bit to have that hole close up.     
5. I hate waiting for the shells to dry, so I cheat and dry the shells using the oven heat. I do this by opening the oven and holding the tray in the oven, rotating it every 10 seconds or so for about a minute. My hands usually get hot at that point. I take them out for about a minute. Then back in again, rotating, for another 30 seconds. This quickly dries out the shells and makes a skin without having to wait 30 minutes at room temp (especially if it's humid!) :p.   
You want to be able to touch the shell and have it not be sticky. Make sure it doesn't shine and you're probably good to go.   
6. Bake for 10 minutes at 325 and drop to 300 for another 5-10 minutes.  
 nbsp;  
**Raspberry Ganache**    
25 g raspberry puree      
70 g white chocolate      
 nbsp;  
1. So normally I also add a bit of cream, but was lazy (recurring theme) and didn't. It still turned out fine.  
2. Put the white chocolate over a double boiler and mostly melt. Take off double boiler when there are a few unmelted pieces remaining.  
3. Puree raspberries and then sieve out the seeds. Heat in a small saucepan until it warms up a little.  
4. Add the raspberry puree to the white chocolate and fold together until incorporated.  
5. Transfer to a piping bag and chill it in the fridge or freezer for a short while to firm up before piping onto the macaron shells.    
6. After piping, let the macarons rest in an airtight container in the fridge overnight for optimal chewiness!   
Gluck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> And mmkay, here's there recipe. I reduced the granulated sugar from what I normally do and I think this has helped out with my shells.  
 nbsp;  
**Macaron Shells**  
For about 10 1.5 inch macarons:  
46 g almond flour (sift, no big almond pieces)  
42 g powdered sugar  
5 g Abuelita chocolate tablet (ground in a processor and sifted)  
35 g egg whites (room temp)  
25 g granulated sugar  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven to 325F. Measure out and sift your powdered sugar, almond flour, and sifted chocolate powder. Whisk together and set aside.  
2. Make your meringue. Beat/ whisk your egg whites until frothy and start to incorporate the granulated sugar a bit a time. Beat until stiff peaks. Didn't add any food coloring to this recipe, but you could always do that shortly before reaching stiff peaks.  
3. Macaronage. Look up on Youtube if you're unfamiliar on how to do so.   
Basically, fold about half your dry ingredients into the meringue until just incorporated and then add the rest and continue folding until you get a lava like consistency. Fold by scraping along the edge of the bowl to deflate the meringue a bit and then scooping the batter. Repeat. You should be able to pick up the spatula and have the batter fall down in a ribbon. The ribbon should incorporate back into the main blob after about 10 seconds. If it doesn't fall correctly, I do a few more folds. Put into a piping bag.  
4. Pipe out your macarons. I use a silpat (would highly recommend). Rap the baking sheet against the table a few times.  Pop any air bubbles with a toothpick and swirl the toothpick around a bit to have that hole close up. I added some ground up chocolate powder on top.    
5. I hate waiting for the shells to dry, so I cheat and dry the shells using the oven heat. I do this by opening the oven and holding the tray in the oven, rotating it every 10 seconds or so for about a minute. My hands usually get hot at that point. I take them out for about a minute. Then back in again, rotating, for another 30 seconds. This quickly dries out the shells and makes a skin without having to wait 30 minutes :p.   
You want to be able to touch the shell and have it not be sticky. For any macaron you sprinkle things on top, you want to make sure the shell has had adequate time to dry on the top as well, and not just sides. Make sure it doesn't shine and you're probably good to go.   
6. Bake for 10 minutes at 325 and drop to 300 for another 5-10 minutes. [NOTE, I actually forgot to drop the temp down to 300 immediately after putting in the oven, so maybe this might work fine.]    
 nbsp;  
**Abuelita Mexican Chocolate Ganache**   
3/8 of an Abuelita tablet (33.75 g)     
50 g heavy cream  
70 g white chocolate      
 nbsp;  
1. Add cream and 3/8 of a tablet and heat over low. Stir and incorporate chocolate into the cream.  
2. Reduce down to about 30 ml cream and then take off heat to cool slightly.  
3. Put white chocolate over double boiler and mostly melt. Take off double boiler when there are a few unmelted pieces remaining.  
4. Add slightly cooled cream to the white chocolate and fold together until incorporated. If the cream is too hot, the chocolate will seize so be careful!    
5. Transfer to a piping bag and chill it in the fridge or freezer for a short while to firm up before piping onto the macaron shells.    
6. After piping, let the macarons rest in an airtight container in the fridge overnight for optimal chewiness!   
Gluck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> /u/republican4,  
Here's the recipe I used for these. Note, I changed the amount of powdered sugar and granulated sugar from my normal protocol, but it still worked out. I also scaled up slightly so that I could have enough batter for different colors (I normally only use 35 g egg white = 1 egg white). This is the French method.   
 nbsp;  
**Macaron Shells**  
For about 10 2 inch macarons:  
68 g almond flour (sift, no big almond pieces)  
62 g powdered sugar  
50 g egg whites (room temp)  
40 g granulated sugar  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven to 300F (or 325F, see below). Measure out and sift your powdered sugar and almond flour. Whisk together and set aside. *Note:* For these, I decided to throw the almond flour and powdered sugar into a food processor to make it extra fine before sifting in hopes it would be easy to manipulate when I piped out different colors.  
2. Make your meringue. Beat/ whisk your egg whites until frothy and start to incorporate the granulated sugar a bit a time. Beat until stiff peaks. Don't add any food coloring yet.       
3*a*. To use different colors and not make more batter, first incorporate the dry ingredients into the meringue so that it is just barely mixed together.   
*b*. Split the batter into roughly 1/3 for orange, 1/3 for white (no food coloring or maybe a smidge of yellow), 2/9 for dark red, and 1/9 for slightly lighter red.   
*c*. Once batter is separated, add food coloring and folded until the right consistency. You should look up macaronage (folding of ingredients) on Youtube if you dont know how already.  
 nbsp;  
In summary: Fold by basically scraping along the edge of the bowl and then pressing down along the center in sort of a J shape. Do this until you have a lava like consistency, where you can pick up your spatula and the batter will drop down in a ribbon. My test is to bang the bowl on the table and see if the ribbon that just fell incorporates back into the main blobif it does, its ready. Otherwise, I do a few more folds.   
 nbsp;  
*d*.  Put into piping bags. Normal macaron tips for the white and orange but use tiny tips for the dark red and red. You'll need to draw out the section shape.   
4. Pipe out your macarons. I use a silpat (would highly recommend).  
*a*. First with the orange batter, hold the tip perpendicularly at about a half inch above the silpat and pipe out an amount slightly bigger than the tip (it should spread horizontally if you don't move your tip).  
*b*. Then using the white batter, place the tip on the center and pipe out an amount to make a size of a normal macaron.  
*c*. Using the dark red batter, pipe out section shapes, but leaving a white center (8 sections ended up being the optimal amount for me).  
*d*. Use the lighter red to add drops along those darker red sections.  
*e*. With a toothpick, adjust the shapes of the sections so that the white batter isn't too thick at any point.  
*f*. Add a drop of white in the center and use a toothpick to move along the white that separates sections.  
5. Rap the baking sheet against the table a few times.  Pop any air bubbles with a toothpick and swirl the toothpick around a bit to have that hole close up.  
6. I hate waiting for the shells to dry, so I cheat and actually put the oven temp at 325. Then I open the oven and hold the tray in the oven, rotating it every 10 seconds or so for about a minute. Then again for another 30 seconds. This quickly dries out the shells and makes a skin :p.  
You want to be able to touch the shell and have it not be sticky. Then I drop down the oven temp back to 300 (its about this low anyways since the door has been open.).  
6. Bake for 15-20 minutes.  
 nbsp;  
**Blood Orange Curd/ Ganache Hybrid**  
1 blood orange, juiced       
5 g corn starch  
50 g granulated sugar  
1 egg yolk  
50 g white chocolate  
40 g heavy cream   
 nbsp;  
1. Juice blood orange and strain. Heat up and reduce so it's not as liquidy.  
2. Beat the egg yolk and add sugar and sifted corn starch, and lemon juice. Whisk well.  
3. While whisking, slowly add the heated up blood orange juice onto the egg/sugar/cornstarch. You're tempering the egg to prevent it from scrambling. Once it's fully incorporated, add the mixture back into the saucepan and stir constantly on medium. Eventually, it'll start to thicken. I usually thicken until it's a nice paste. [I just got a hand blender, so I now turn that on and blend the mixture while it's heating up to make it super smooth. Not required though.]   
4. Take off the heat and transfer to a bowl (I sieved it to get rid of corn starch clumps.)  
5. Add cream to the pot used for the curd and reduce significantly.  
6. Add white chocolate over a double boiler and melt the chocolate until there are only a few chips that are unmelted. Add the cream to make a ganache.  
7.  Stir in the ganache into the curd and chill. I transfer to a piping bag and chill it in the fridge or freezer for a short while to firm up before piping onto my macaron shells.  
8. Pipe the filling onto the shells and assemble macarons.  
9. Let the macarons rest in an airtight container in the fridge overnight for optimal chewiness!

If this is confusing, let me know and I can try to clarify.

<TEXT> I used different colored macaron batters. I had previously added different colored dots to the edges and pulled them in with a toothpick to make sort of slice looking things. With that in mind, I knew I could something similar for these for the segments and refine it a little.  
For general composition, about a week ago, I thought about how I could get the edges to be orange. I knew the batter spreads outward when you hold the tip at a fixed height above the silpat, so I figured if you piped one color first, then added another to the center, it would push the first color outward. Yay it worked!  
I went through some trial and error to figure out if I should do orange, white, red and then add stripes of white or do orange, white then trace out segments and refine with a toothpick. The latter worked better. But in the pic you can sort of see some of the trial and error :p. Another challenge was not knowing what proportion of colors to make. I ended up splitting my batter 1/3 orange, 1/3 dark red, 2/9 white, and 1/9 a lighter red. Obviously, if you make more batter, this isn't an issue, but I'm stingy so I didn't want to make more. I had a lot of leftover dark red and didn't have enough orange. But yes, it also took forever. lol.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ooh, so I'm personally really bad at taste and find it difficult to think of bitter tastes. I've asked several people who ate the cake though, and they say they didn't encounter that taste. But maybe the "tartness" I encountered was actually the bitterness? Though, I'm pretty sure I tasted the same thing when eating the kiwifruit on its own before adding to the whipped cream.  
 nbsp;  
I know kiwifruit is often used on top of whipped cream frosted cakes and I don't believe the bitterness is an issue there. I've been trying to read up on it and it says actinidin also liquifies whipped cream. This definitely wasn't the case even at the local points of contact. But I'm sure actinidin exposed on the surface could act on cream (I can't think of why not).  
 nbsp;   
Now I want to understand actinidin's mechanism of action for digestion of dairy proteins. And maybe how it compares to papain (papaya) and bromelain (pineapple). I'll also perform an experiment with different kiwi-whipped cream incubation times and test for this taste. Yay science. Though, I do wish there was a more quantitative bitter test. (Maybe there is, I should also look into that). </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, here's the recipe. It's pretty simple to execute.  
**1. Sponge** [makes 1 jelly roll sheet]  
112g cake flour  
1 tsp baking powder  
1/4 tsp salt  
5 large eggs, separated  
156 g granulated sugar  
60 g whole milk  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven at 400F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper or silpat.  
2. Whisk together sifted flour, baking powder, and salt.  
3. In a different, large bowl, whisk egg yolks, sugar, and milk until pale.  
4. Separately, whisk egg whites until medium stiff peaks.  
5. Add dry mixture to wet mixture and fold together. Then slowly fold in the medium stiff egg whites. I usually add 1/3 of the meringue first to make the batter light, then fold in the remaining egg whites.    
6. Pour batter onto the baking sheet and then rap the sheet down a few times to release any big air bubbles.  
7. Bake for 10ish minutes (a toothpick should go in and out cleanly).  
8. Using a knife or something thin, move along the edge of the pan and cake. Remove cake from pan and silpat and let cool.   
 nbsp;  
**2. Stabilized Whipped Cream Frosting:**  
470 g heavy whipping cream  
10 g powdered sugar  
10-20 g powdered sugar (depending on your sweetness preferences)  
5 g corn starch  
 nbsp;  
1. Whenever whipping your own cream, make sure the first thing you do is throw your bowl and whisk attachment into the fridge or freezer. Cold is your best friend.  
2. First make your corn starch paste. Add corn starch, 10g of powdered sugar, and about 100 g of cream and stir in a pot.  
3. Heat over medium, stirring constantly. When it just becomes paste-like (you will see a drastic change in the consistency from very liquidy to a little custard like), take the pan off the heat and continue to mix until smooth. You want to make sure the cream doesn't seize, so don't leave it on the stove. Cool to room temperature.    
3. Take out chilled bowl and whisk and add the second powdered sugar and remainder of the cream. Whisk until soft peaks.  
4. Whisking at a fast speed, add in the paste (make sure it's not hot!), a bit at a time.  
5. Whisk until stiff peaks and corn starch paste is well incorporated.  
 nbsp;  
**Assembly:**  
1. Peel kiwis (I used a spoon, pressed up against the skin to scoop them out). Slice several kiwis into thin rectangles (1ish kiwi per layer).  
2. Slice cake into thirds. Remove any obvious crumbs.  
3. Smooth out a layer of whipped cream on the first slice of cake.  
4. Add the kiwi pieces and press in a stripe like pattern down the length of the cake (or however you like).  
5. Add the next slice and repeat.  
6. Once all layers are assembled, finish off by coating the cake. I go slowly to not get crumbs showing. You can add a small amount then throw it in the fridge. Then add the final amount to cover any crumbs. As a final smoothing out process, I like to use a heated up angled spatula and run it across each side.  
7. Add cut up kiwi to decorate the top.  
8. Once finished frosting, chill the cake in the fridge.  
 nbsp;  
*Final Notes*  
1. Most fruits will taste great in this sort of preparation! The freshness is a great juxtaposition to the heavy whipped cream and light sponge.  
2. You don't have to add the cornstarch paste, normal whipped cream with just heavy cream and powdered sugar will do fine. I use the stabilized so that it holds extra well.  
3. I found that the cake was sweet, but there was a tartness about the kiwis. You could possibly try making a simple syrup and dipping the kiwis in before lying them onto the whipped cream for the layers. I highly doubt this will cause the cake to become overtly sweet.  
4. Gluck and enjoy!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The kiwis I used were pretty ripe, so they were super sweet. BUT, kiwis, in general, are also tart. I personally thought there was a bit too much tartness for the sweetness of the whipped cream and sponge. However, other people who ate it thought it tasted fine. I think putting in other fruits (like strawberry) would have made it great. Fruit, overall, provide a nice freshness against the creaminess of the whipped cream. </TEXT>

<TEXT> /u/doyoueven_reddit,   
Here's the recipe. It looks long, but it's not too bad. You need to have two different sized silicon or other dome shaped molds if want this shape. Otherwise, you can pretty much use whatever you have, as long as you think you can demold it. The mousse, cake, and gel are super tasty together and will work in any setting.  
There are four main components: a jaconde sponge (an almondy sponge), a mango mousse, a mango gel, and a mirror glaze. The decorations are some food coloring and some tempered dark chocolate (double boiler: heat to 115F -- take off heat and add a few chocolate chips-- stir/ add chocolate until 83F -- heat back to 90F).  
 nbsp;  
**1. Mango Gele:**  
4.5 g gelatin (+ about 15 g water to bloom)    
100 g mango puree (sieved)
50 g water  
30 g sugar  
 nbsp;  
1. Bloom gelatin. Stir water into gelatin to get apple sauce consistency.  
2. Heat the mango puree, water and sugar in a small saucepan and dissolve sugar and bring to a boil.  
3. Remove from heat and add the gelatin. Mix.  
4. Cool a bit and then pour into a small half sphere mold. Freeze.  
 nbsp;  
**2. Jaconde Sponge:**  
70 g almond flour  
70 g powdered sugar   
70 g egg yolk  
30 g egg white (1)   
130 g egg white (2)   
45 g sugar  
70 g flour  
25 g melted butter  
 nbsp;  
1. Preheat oven to 440F. Get a sheet pan and lie down some parchment paper or silpat.  
2. Mix sifted almond flour and powdered sugar.  
3. To that same bowl, add the yolks and the whites (1) and beat until smooth.   
4. Add the sifted flour.  
5. Make a meringue by whisking the second egg whites (2) with the sugar to stiff peaks. First bring egg whites (2) to a foam, then slowly incorporate the sugar.   
6. Fold about half the meringue into the batter, then add the butter and stir.  
7. Fold in the remainder of the meringue.  
8. Pour the batter onto your baking sheet and spread it out to an even layer.  
9. Bake for 6 minutes, give or take. Use a toothpick to make sure the batter has cooked.  
10. Cool cake and cut out whatever shape you need. I used round cookie cutters to be the bases of my dome cakes.  
 nbsp;  
**3. Mango Mousse:**  
90 g heavy cream     
115 g mango puree (sieved)  
3.5 g gelatin (+ about 15 g water to bloom)      
30 g Italian meringue **  
**  
15 g water  
60g sugar  
30 g egg white  
 nbsp;  
1. Bloom the gelatin. Stir water into gelatin to get an apple sauce like consistency.    
2. Heat the mango puree over medium heat and dissolve the bloomed gelatin in it. Pour in a bowl and leave to cool (the fridge helps to expedite).     
3. Prepare the Italian meringue:   
a. In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and water.  
b. On low and stirring occasionally, cook the syrup.   
c. Start whisking the egg whites until foaming.   
d. When the syrup reaches 240F, remove the saucepan from the heat pour in a thin stream, while whisking the egg white. Whisk to stiff peaks.    
4. Whip the cream. Prechilled bowl and whisk speed up the process.  
5. Fold in meringue into the puree/gelatin (make sure its not warm).   
6. Fold in the whipped cream into that mixture.     
 nbsp;  
**Assembly:**  
1. Add mousse into a piping bag and then pipe a bit into a larger dome mold.  
2. Demold the frozen mango gel from the smaller mold and push into the mousse you piped in.   
3. Top with the cutout of the sponge.  
4. Freeze.  
 nbsp;  
**4. Mirror Glaze:**  
100 g white chocolate   
35 g condensed milk  
50 g sugar  
61.25 g corn syrup  
25 ml water  
4 g gelatin (+ about 15 ml water to bloom)  
 nbsp;  
1. Mix gelatin in water until you get an apple sauce consistency.  
2. In a small pot add corn syrup, water, and sugar and bring to a boil.  
3. Add in gelatin and condensed milk. Whisk until gelatin fully dissolved.  
4. In a bowl with the chocolate, add the liquid mixture and whisk until chocolate is fully melted. If you have a hand blender, I highly recommend that you use it to blend the chocolate.   
5. Portion off and add desired food coloring. Do some more hand blending.  
6. Bring the glaze to about a bit warmer than room temp (85F to 100F is probably okay [30C - 37C]).  
 nbsp;  
**Final Decoration:**  
1. After the cakes have set, remove from mold and set it on top of a drying rack on top of a sheet pan for easy clean up.  
2. Pour glaze over dome cakes creating desired designs with other color glazes.  
3. Let the glaze fully drip off. Clean off the surplus drips on the bottom of the cake and then transfer to a serving plate.  
4. Garnish with whatever other fancy stuff you want.  
a. I used some food coloring splattered with a paint brush and some tempered chocolate cut up into bits and into little rectangles.  You can really do whatever though and it'll look good.  
5. Freeze or refrigerate. The mousse tastes better when its not frozen, but even then, still good!  
 nbsp;  
*Additional notes:*  
1. Unless you have a blast freezer, it'll take a few days to make, so plan accordingly.  
2. I talk about silicone half sphere molds here. But anything would work. Just be cognizant to not put hot things on frozen things, for obvious reasons.  
3. You can adapt for whatever fruit you like for the gel and mousse. The mousse on its own also tastes great. You may want to reduce the amount of puree if you want it to be a thicker consistency.    
4. For a chocolate jaconde sponge, instead use 55 g of flour and 20 g of cocoa powder.  
 nbsp;  
Enjoy!

<TEXT> /u/seattlesloth,  
So this was actually supposed to have more raspberry batter, but I ended up putting more matcha batter in. Hence, the filling looks mostly green. I'll just post the recipe for a matcha dark chocolate cake. If you want a raspberry one or a mixed matcha raspberry one, just make some raspberry batter and put some some  in. *[For the raspberry base, you want to use 20 g butter and 30 g raspberry puree (add after mixing the egg, before flour).]*    
This dessert has four components. The dark chocolate base, matcha base, almond crumb, and matcha ice cream. Lava cakes are super easy to make and everyone thinks they're fancy. You should definitely try it at least once. You'll need ramekins.  
 nbsp;  
**Lava Cake bases:** *[about 2 small ramekins per base, so 2 bases = 4 ramekins]*  
***1. Dark Chocolate base***  
69 g dark chocolate   
40 g butter  
40 g sugar  
1 egg  
25 g flour  
 nbsp;  
***2. Matcha White Chocolate base:***  
69 g dark chocolate   
40 g butter + a bit to coat the ramekins  
40 g sugar  
1 egg  
25 g flour  
5 g matcha powder, sifted   
 nbsp;  
1. Preheat oven to 450F.  
2. Melt chocolate and butter over a double boiler.  
3. Take off double boiler. Stir in sugar and mix until smooth. Depending on your white chocolate, it may be lumpy ish..that's okay though since it'll smooth out after adding the egg.   
4. Add egg. Mix until smooth.  
5. Sift in flour (or add presifted flour). For matcha base, first whisk together flour and matcha before adding. Stir until smooth.  
6. If the batter is runny, chill in the fridge or freezer for 20 minutes to firm. Add to a piping bag.  
7. Coat ramekins with butter. Be extremely generous. The last thing you want is for your lava cake to be stuck when trying to unmold.  
8. Pipe the chocolate base (I go in swirls from edge to center inward and then vertically along the sides) to "coat" the ramekin. If your batter isn't thick, you need to work quickly and hurry and go to the next step.  
9. Pipe in some of the matcha base inside of this chocolate coating.  
10. Finally cover up the matcha base with more chocolate base. Chill in fridge for a bit (10 - 15min is probably fine).  
11. Bake for 9 - 10 minutes. You should see that the top of the lava cake no longer has a wet looking center. Watch it carefully starting at around 8.5 minutes. I carefully scrape along the sides of the ramekin and then put a plate on top and flip over.   
 nbsp;  
Try a single tester one first to see if it's able to come out nicely. If too runny, go for another minute and if it isn't runny at all, then bake for less.    
 nbsp;  
**3. Almond Crumb:**  
35 g almond flour  
35 g sugar  
25 g butter  
 nbsp;  
1. Preheat over to 400F. (Any temp works actually, you just need to check it to make sure it doesn't burn.)  
2. Combine ingredients in a food processor. Mixing by hand also works, but you need to work harder. You want a cookie dough consistency.  
3. Spread the dough over a silpat or parchment paper to make a thin layer.  
4. Bake for 10-20 minutes. Check back often so that it doesn't burn. Take to your own desired level of browness. Initially, you'll see the butter sort of bubbling, but shortly after that it starts to harden. I use a fork to mix the crumb as it's baking.  
5. I cool the crumb/ cookie for a short time and then put it in a cup and smash it up with a spoon. You could also throw it into a processor and blitz it up.  
 nbsp;  
**4. Matcha No Churn Ice Cream:**   
396 g (14 oz can) condensed milk  
2 tsp vanilla extract  
pinch of salt  
470 g heavy whipping cream  
15 g matcha powder, sifted  
 nbsp;  
1. Chill bowl and whisk that you're going to use to whip whipping cream.  
2. Whip the whipping cream and add the matcha powder a bit before you reach stiff peaks. Take to stiff peaks.   
3. Whisk in the condensed milk.  
4. Pour into a container and freeze for several hours.  
*Note:* I found that the ice cream had a weird consistency after a day of freezing, so I blended the frozen mixture and then refroze it. It had a much nicer consistency after that.  
OR if you want to be lazy, you can just buy some vanilla ice cream and mix in some matcha powder and refreeze.  
 nbsp;  
Gluck and enjoy! These lava cakes are honestly super easy to make and taste phenomenally. If you don't want a filling in it, then just make lots of the chocolate batter and bake that.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Omnom. Just made some flan cream puffs and I never realized how easy flan was to make :o!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> /u/ept91,  
Mmkay, so right off the bat the vision I had in my head was that I could make flan and then blend it into a thick custard that I could then pipe into the cream puffs. As I mentioned, this won't work. It will basically return it to a liquid, a thick liquid..but definitely not pipeable. At this point, I was like "incorporate it into a whipped cream!," but then I added basically way too much flan liquid and had to do a subsequent whipped cream incorporation to get a consistency that was okay. Below I'll list something that I'm sure will work way better.  
There are three components for this recipe. The choux pastry, the flan /caramel, and whipped cream filling. I used the recipe from [Allrecipes](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/20979/spanish-flan/) for the flan.    
 nbsp;  
**1. Choux pastry: [for about 25-30 cream puffs]**  
200 g water  
125 g milk  
112 g butter (stick, cut into small pieces)  
4 g salt  
4 g sugar  
150 g flour  
4 eggs  
 nbsp;  
1. Preheat oven to 400F.  
2. Add milk, water, butter, sugar, and salt into a saucepan and bring to boil. You want your butter to have melted prior to boiling, so make sure you cut up the stick of butter into small pieces.  
3. Take the saucepan off the heat, and add in the flour. Stir in (wooden spoon is best) the flour until everything comes together into a ball.  
4. Return to heat and stir vigorously until you start to see some dried residue on the side (~2-3 minutes). Sometimes if I'm not sure, I just stir for longer. In my experience, having less liquid in that dough hasn't been an issue.  
5. Transfer the dough into a bowl and beat until steam no longer rises. If it's in a stand mixer, until the bowl is no longer hot to the touch. You don't want to scramble your eggs that you're about to incorporate.    
6. One at a time, beat in the eggs. Be patient and don't add them all at once.  
7. Dough/ batter should now be a bit droopy. Add to a piping bag with a large round tip.  
8. Pipe you desired size onto a silpat or parchment paper (though, silpats are awesome and everyone should use them).  
9. Grab a small bowl of water and using your finger dipped in water, flatten all the points which resulted from piping them. Those little points will burn in the oven, so flatten those and any other pointy edges which may be on your silpat.  
10. Bake until the cream puffs are golden brown (~30 minutes). Opening the oven/ taking them out before this will cause them to collapse on themselves. You want the puffs to form a solid structure.  
11. After a light golden brown, I take out the tray and stab holes in the bottom of all the puffs using a chopstick. I'm sure there are better ways to do this.    
12. I drop the temp down to 300ish F and put the chopstick stabbed puffs back into the oven to allow the insides to dry out. Usually I leave them in for another 15 minutes. I eat a sample one and if it's still doughy inside, I leave it for longer.  
13. Let cool.  
 nbsp;  
**2. Flan:**  
200 g sugar (though you can definitely get away with less)  
3 eggs  
1 can evaporated milk (12 fl oz)  
1 can sweetened condensed milk (14 fl oz)  
a bit of vanilla extract if you want  
 nbsp;  
1. Preheat oven to 350F.  
2. Make your caramel by adding the sugar into a saucepan and letting it heat up over low-medium heat. Melt until fully liquefied and golden. Do not stir it constantly, as this will cause the caramel to seize. With your caramel, add to the bottom of your flan dish/ ramekins. Save a little bit of caramel to swirl into the filling.     
3. In a large bowl, beat the eggs.  
4. Add and beat in evaporated milk and vanilla and then condensed milk until you get a smooth mixture.  
5. Pour the mixture into your dish/ ramekins, about 2/3 filled.  
6. Heat up some water and stop before boiling. Add to a deep roasting pan and put your flan dish/ ramekins into the water bath. About half way up the sides of the flan dishes is good.  
7. Bake in the oven for about 40-60 minutes until set.  
 nbsp;  
**3. Flan whipped cream filling:**  
1/3 of the flan your prepared  
set aside caramel + a little extra cream    
300 g heavy cream  
 nbsp;  
1. Throw mixing bowl and whisk that you're going to make the whipped cream in into the fridge. Cold helps the whipping process.    
2. Add a small amount of cream (this will vary depending on how much caramel you set aside, but a tbsp is probably sufficient) to the caramel, which has probably solidified. Throw in the microwave for 30 seconds and stir everything together. You should have a nice caramel sauce. Let cool (a quick time in the fridge speeds up the process, but don't let it harden!).  
3. Take the flan and blend together. I used a hand blender. They make everything better. At this point it should have reverted back into a thick liquid. Throw it in the fridge/ freezer to cool.  
4. Add the heavy cream to the chilled bowl and whisk until stiff peaks. Don't be afraid to take it pretty far.  
5. Fold in some chilled blended flan mixture to the whipped cream. You need to use your judgement here. My issue when I made this was that I added it all to the whipped cream and made the entire mixture too soft. Keep folding in more flan mixture until you start noticing the stiff peaks are being soft.  
6. Take the caramel sauce and swirl it into the mixture.  
7. Add to a piping bag and pipe into chopstick hole of the room temperature puffs when ready to serve. Warm puffs will melt the filling. Don't fill the night before. They will get soggy.  
 nbsp;  
*Main Takeaways + Tips*  
1. I baked the flan because I really wanted to get the flavor into the filling and there were raw eggs in the mixture, so I couldn't just incorporate that. Turns out the eggs don't add that much taste. The predominant taste from the blended flan was condensed milk.  
2. SO, to save yourself the step of baking flan (though, it is super tasty!), you can just make some whipped cream and fold in/ whisk in some condensed milk. Adding in that final swirl of caramel should replicate the taste of flan pretty well without having to go through the actual flan step.  
3. Packaged powder flan is also a good bet. A few months ago, I made a whipped cream and added the powdered flan and the caramel sauce it came with and it tasted great. This is also an option.  
 nbsp;  
Whatever you choose, gluck! I use this choux pastry recipe for all my cream puffs and eclairs. It has served me well and hopefully it does the same for you!     </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yea, I have. It works quite well for tart fruits like raspberries since the freeze dried fruits are packed with flavor. But I get lazy, so I haven't done it in a while. Just subtract however many grams of fruit powder from the amount of powdered sugar you're using.  
But yea, I'm lazy which is also why I do the French method lol. I usually start making them when I get home at 8:30 or 9pm. And it takes about an hour an a half from start to clean up for a small batch of macarons. These mango ones took a little longer since I had to paint the shells. </TEXT>

<TEXT> :(. If your meringue isn't stiff enough to begin with you can suffer from this. Also, hmm. At one point is your batter thick? If you fold too much, you can deflate the batter too much. But yes, the only time my batter has been too thin is if I overmixed or if my meringue was not stuff enough to begin with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh hmm. Might be from overmixing the batter and in terms of overbeating the egg whites, I always see that on troubleshooting pages, but I'm not 100% what that means. I feel like it's probably pretty hard to go past stiff peaks. I will say, however, that I suffer from hollows more than I'd like to with this recipe. I can only 100% or close to 100% avoid them when I use the Italian method. I prefer this one though for its ease, quickness, and ability to use smaller amounts of ingredients. I'm still trying to find a sweet spot, but I've found that the hollow issue can be significantly remedied by baking for longer times. The issue is that the insides aren't baking fast enough. So like, immediately out of the oven the cookie will be full, but once it cools, it collapses on itself.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So a large number of macarons you get at pastry shops have a flavorless shell (unless it's a flavor that can incorporate dry ingredients, like cocoa or matcha). Instead, the flavor comes from the filling. I am a very big proponent on curds as fillings. They absorb super well into the shell and make the macarons taste phenomenal :). And for curds, you can use any fruit. Ones that have acidity are better, since the can cut through butter taste. But even ones that aren't super, they still taste great. Just concentrate your puree to maximize flavor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So this is also one of my big pet peeves, but apparently some words in French that have one 'o' have two in English, like 'typhon' in French is 'typhoon' in English, as explained by a friend who speaks French fluently. So maybe purple think they need this extra 'o'. BUT, still a pet peeve and doesn't explain why they pronounce macaron as written, with two o's. Hmph </TEXT>

<TEXT> Add your batter to a piping bag. The batter is stiff enough, then when you pipe out a circle, it'll stay put. The reason macarons have little ruffled feet is because you let the skin dry out before you bake what your just piped out. This forces the air that you have trapped (from the meringue) to go downward as opposed to up) to form those feet. But yes, you just pipe them into those circles. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh interesting. There are a few things I can think of off the top of my head. What temperature were they? And did you have a bowl that was completely free of any oil/ fat? Also, aging the egg whites is said to help. For me, I make sure my egg whites are at room temp. (Sometimes I just put them in a bowl and then put that bowl into a larger one with hot water so they can heat up quickly.)   
Also, if there is any fat/oil in your bowl, the meringue will be doomed to fail from the get go.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, I think recipes that call for number of folds are ridiculous haha. Also which method did you use? Italian or French? (Did you use a simple syrup or did you make them with just sugar and egg whites/ cream of tartar?). If the batter never reaches a lava drip that can mean your almond flour/ powdered sugar amounts are off. Too much dry ingredients can cause this. (It has happened to me when I've added too much matcha powder.)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That very much sounds like you overmixed your batter. Make sure you have stiff peaks for your meringue as well. In terms of lumpiness, make sure your almond flour is sifted out. To make it extra smooth you can put it in a food processor with powdered sugar. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And the recipe (the same one I use for all my macaron pics I upload here:  
Recipes were modified and adapted from Macarons by Natalie and Macaronguy for the curd. This is the French method.  
 nbsp;  
Macaron Shells  
For about 10 1.5 inch macarons:  
46 g almond flour (sift, no big almond pieces)  
41.5 g powdered sugar (give or take, since kitchen scales don't have this precision)  
35 g egg whites (room temp)  
35 g granulated sugar  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven to 300F (or 325F, see below). Measure out and sift your powdered sugar and almond flour. Whisk together and set aside.  
2. Make your meringue. Beat/ whisk your egg whites until frothy and start to incorporate the granulated sugar a bit a time. Beat until stiff peaks. I added some orange and yellow food coloring shortly before it reached stiff peaks.     
3. Okay. You should look up macaronage (folding of ingredients) on Youtube if you dont know how already.  
 nbsp;  
In summary: add in dry ingredients to the meringue, a third at a time until mixed. And folding by basically scraping along the edge of the bowl and then pressing down along the center in sort of a J shape. Do this until you have a lava like consistency, where you can pick up your spatula and the batter will drop down in a ribbon. My test is to bang the bowl on the table and see if the ribbon that just fell incorporates back into the main blobif it does, its ready. Otherwise, I do a few more folds. Put into a piping bag.   
 nbsp;  
4. Pipe out your macarons. I use a silpat (would highly recommend). Rap the baking sheet against the table a few times.  Pop any air bubbles with a toothpick and swirl the toothpick around a bit to have that hole close up.  
5. I hate waiting for the shells to dry, so I cheat and actually put the oven temp at 325. Then I open the oven and hold the tray in the oven, rotating it every 10 seconds or so for about a minute. Then again for another 30 seconds. This quickly dries out the shells and makes a skin :p.  
You want to be able to touch the shell and have it not be sticky. Then I drop down the oven temp back to 300 (its about this low anyways since the door has been open.).  
6. Bake for 15-20 minutes.  
 nbsp;  
Mango Curd  
1/2 ripe mango         
16 g corn starch  
50 g granulated sugar  
1 egg yolk  
10ish g lemon juice  
28.5 g butter (you can add less depending on how far you take your puree/ cornstarch/ yolk mixture)    
 nbsp;  
1. Puree mango and strain. Heat up until simmering.  
2. Lightly beat the egg yolk and add sugar, sifted corn starch, and lemon juice. Mix/ whisk well.  
3. While whisking, slowly add the heated up mango puree onto the egg/sugar/cornstarch/lemon. You're tempering the egg to prevent it from scrambling. Once it's fully incorporated, add the mixture back into the saucepan and stir constantly on medium. Eventually, it'll start to thicken. I usually thicken until it's a nice paste. [I just got a hand blender, so I now turn that on and blend the mixture while it's heating up to make it super smooth. Not required though.]   
4. Take off the heat and stir in the butter, a little a time. (Or blend it in with your awesome hand blender!)    
5. I transfer to a piping bag and chill it in the fridge or freezer for a short while to firm up before piping onto my macaron shells.  
6. Add gel food coloring to small containers with a few drops of vodka (will dilute out the stickiness of the food coloring and will evaporate quickly.)  
7. I initially tried painting on the red/ green gradient with little success. Then I just tried smudging it on and it worked much better! haha.  
8. Let the shells dry for about 5 minutes before piping in the filling.  
9. Let the macarons rest in an airtight container in the fridge overnight for optimal chewiness!    
Gluck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know this was a few weeks ago, but here are my two cents.  
This probably goes against what everyone else does, but I just accumulate egg whites from other things I bake when I only need the yolks. I just store it in the freezer if I know I'm taking a bit of hiatus from baking. Fridge otherwise. HOWEVER, I have also just used a fresh egg out of the fridge before as well. Especially for Italian method.      
When I bake macarons, I weigh out some cold egg whites in a small bowl and place that bowl inside a larger one filled with hot water (I've never had an issue with them being cooked from that) so that they reach room temp.   
And for the drying of the shells, I set the oven to about 25 degrees hotter than I need it and literally hold the tray inside and rotate it every 10 seconds. After about a minute, the shells have formed a nice skin. Then I throw them in to start baking and drop the temp back down to normal (it probably already reached that level by my having the door open while rotating the tray).  
It saves me the 30 minutes it would normally take for them to dry out and I haven't really noticed a difference. Feet come out just fine and the macarons bake well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It may or may not come up, but for my own reference, this was the recipe I used.  
I based my recipe from Justonecookbook, which covers a basic green tea one. However, I split the batter into three and added flavoring at the end. I'm not sure if that's taboo, since the recipe said don't overmix...BUT, I didn't have any issues so I think it's fine. I'll list what I did. The thai tea, ube, and green tea amounts are for 1/3 of the batter. If you want to make just one of those flavors, multiply by 3.    
 nbsp;  
**Madeleines:** *thai tea/ ube/ green tea*  [18-20 total madeleines]  
113 g unsalted butter + some melted butter for coating pan  
113 g sugar  
120 g flour (sifted)   
pinch of salt  
5 g baking powder  
2 large eggs  (room temp)  
15 g milk  
*For green tea:* 2.5 g matcha powder  
*For ube:* 2.5 g ube extract  
*For thai tea:*  2.5 g thai tea powder  
 nbsp;  
1. Melt butter in a small pan. Cool butter to room temp once it has melted.  
2. Add sugar, flour, and sugar into a bowl. *Note*, if you're going to make only one flavor, add any dry ingredients now (thai tea powder or matcha powder). Whisk to combine.    
3. In a separate bowl, add eggs and milk and whisk until frothy throughout. If you're making only the ube flavor, add the ube extract to this mixture.     
4. Add the wet ingredients to dry ingredients and fold together.  
5. Add the cooled butter and fold some more until completely blended.  
6. Now, for multiple flavors, divide your batter into three (I put ~150 g of this batter into two other bowls).  
7. Add in the flavoring and fold until incorporated. I tried not over over mixing.  
8. Cool the batters down in the fridge for at least an hour or if you're in a hurry you can throw them in the freezer for 30 min (guilty).  
9. Use a pastry brush or something to spread the melted butter onto the madeleine pan. Be generous.  
10. Fill each mold with some batter. I put the pan on a scale and added in 25 g of batter. It equated to about a 1 tbsp of batter. Youtube videos online also use those small ice cream scoops as well. You don't want to overfill it.  
11. Bake at 375F for 11 min.  
12. Take out and let cool for a few minutes and then remove from pans and let cool further on a cooling rack.  
 nbsp;  
**Custard:** *thai tea/ ube/ green tea*  
1 large egg yolk  
9.25 g corn starch  
85 g milk  
25 g sugar  
~1ish gram of either thai tea powder, ube extact, or matcha powder  
 nbsp;  
1. Combine egg yolks and cornstarch until fully incorporated.  
2. In a saucepan, high heat, combine milk and sugar. If you're just doing one flavor for the custard, incorporate it now.  
3. Bring to boil and remove from heat.  
4. While whisking constantly, slowly add to bowl with yolks and cornstarch. You are tempering the egg yolks so that they won't scramble.  
5. Return the mixture to the saucepan on high heat.  
6. Bring to rolling boil, while whisking/ mixing constantly. The mixture will become custard like.  
7. To get rid of lumps in your custard you can either sieve it through a fine mesh or use a hand blender (works like magic!). Or you might not have any lumps to begin with and then you're all set.  
8. Divide custard into three and then stir in respective flavoring.  
9. Add custard into a piping bag with a small tip.  
 nbsp;  
**Filling:**  
1. Make a cavity in the madeleines. I was ghetto and stabbed the bottom edge of the madeleine with a chopstick and swirled it around, making sure to not crack the entry point or the cookie itself. 
2. Pipe in the custard. You should feel pressure to stop/ see that the cookie might crack soon.  
3. Enjoy the deliciousness :D.  
 nbsp;  
*Final notes:*  
It might be beneficial to make the custard first, that way you can pipe it into warm madeleines. I didn't do that and it still worked, but I figure the cookie is easier to cavitize (is this a word?) when warm.  
Gluck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many thanks. After knowing all the hard work that goes in, I'm still on the fence about having to pay a ton of money when you buy a slice of mousse cake at a patisserie. On one hand, I get it. It's tough making for anyone with a normal job and takes many hours. But on the other hand, I'm broke and they're so expensive. Plus, it's a baker's job and just a small fraction of what they'd be working on. Merp. </TEXT>

<TEXT> /u/KlaatuBaradaNibble , /u/DJFlabberGhastly, /u/_not-the-NSA_,  
Sorry, didn't realize stuff was hidden when I initially posted links earlier. I finally finished transcribing the translated recipe from *Verdade de sabor: torta rubus* (you can search for it online). Lots of things didn't make sense with the translation, so I included what I did.    
 nbsp;  
Heads up, it's a very long process. Lots of freezing/ cooling wait steps. Not for the faint of heart. However, the blackberry mousse and gel is really good. So if you're going to make anything, make those. :D   
 nbsp;  
There are 6 components: the chocolate sponge (sort of like a Jaconde sponge), blackberry jam, blackberry mousse, blackberry gele, vanilla cream cheese mousse, and a mirror glaze. This recipe is for a circular cake around 7.5 - 8 inches diameter).    
 nbsp;  
**1. Chocolate Sponge:**  
70 g almond flour  
70 g powdered sugar   
70 g egg yolk   
30 g egg white (1)   
130 g egg white (2)   
45 g sugar  
55 g flour  
20 g cocoa powder  
25 g melted butter  
 nbsp;  
1. Preheat oven to 440F. Get a sheet pan and lie down some parchment paper of silpat.  
2. Mix almond flour and powdered sugar.   
3. To that same bowl, add the yolks and the whites (1) and beat until smooth.   
4. Add the sifted flour and cocoa powder.  
5. Make a meringue by whisking the second egg whites (2) with the sugar to stiff peaks.   
6. Fold the meringue into the rest of the ingredients.  
7. Finally, add the melted butter and gently mix.   
8. Pour the dough on a baking sheet (it shouldnt really move that much since its a thick batter, so just make sure its spread out enough for the size of the cake youre making) and bake for 6 minutes. Use a toothpick to make sure the batter has cooked.   
9. Cool cake and separate from silpat. Cut out your cake shape (6.5-7in).  
 nbsp;  
**2. Blackberry jam:**  
70 g sugar (1)   
15 ml of water  
40 g corn syrup  
200g frozen blackberries  
8 g pectin    
45 g sugar (2)  
12 ml lemon juice  
 nbsp;  
1. In a small bowl, mix the sugar (2) and pectin.   
2. In a small saucepan, add the water, corn syrup, frozen blackberries and lemon juice. Put on medium heat, stirring constantly.   
3. Once the sugar has dissolved and blackberries have thawed, stir the mixture until its very smooth.  
4. When it comes to a boil, take off the heat and pour a thin stream of a mixture onto the sugar/ pectin, stirring constantly.   
5. Put back into the saucepan and boil on high for a few minutes until it reduces a good amount (about 5 minutes).   
6. Remove from heat and strain through a sieve. Let cool.   
7. When the jam has cooled and thickened, put a thin layer on top of the sponge cake. Put in the fridge to cool.  
 nbsp;  
**3. Blackberry Mousse:**  
90 g heavy cream     
90 g of blackberry pulp (pureed)  
3.5 g gelatin (+ about 15 g water to bloom)   
18 g berry liqueur     
30 g Italian meringue **  
**  
15 g water  
60g sugar  
30 g egg white  
 nbsp;  
1. Bloom the gelatin. Stir water into gelatin to get an apple sauce like consistency.    
2. Heat the blackberry puree over medium heat and dissolve the soaked gelatin in it. Pour in a bowl and leave to cool.   
3. Prepare the Italian meringue:   
a. In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and water.  
b. On low and stirring occasionally, cook the syrup.   
c. Start whisking the egg whites until foaming.   
d. When the syrup reaches 240F, remove the saucepan from the heat pour in a thin stream, while whisking the egg white.   
e. Continue whisking to stiff peaks, then add in the berry liqueur.   
4. Whip the cream. Prechilled bowl and whisk speed up the process.  
5. Fold in meringue into the puree/gelatin (make sure its not warm).   
6. Fold in the whipped cream into that mixture.   
7. Pour the mousse into a mold or cake ring (6.5-7in) for and make a layer a little under an inch. Freeze.  
 nbsp;  
**4. Blackberry Gele:**  
4.5 g gelatin (+ about 15 g water to bloom)    
100 g pulp of blackberry (pureed)  
50 g water  
30 g sugar  
 nbsp;  
1. Bloom gelatin. Stir water into gelatin to get apple sauce consistency.  
2. Head the blackberry puree, water and sugar in a small saucepan and dissolve sugar and bring to a boil.  
3. Remove from heat and add the gelatin. Mix. 
4. Cool to room temperature.   
5. Pour over the frozen blackberry mousse, forming a thin layer (less than half an inch). Freeze.  
 nbsp;  
**5. Vanilla Cream Cheese Mousse:**  
70 ml of milk  
50 g sugar  
2 tsp vanilla (or to taste)  
4 egg yolks  
9.5 g gelatin (+about 20 g water to bloom)   
250 g of cream cheese   
350 g heavy cream   
40 g dark chocolate  (shaved/ chopped)   
 nbsp;    
1. Bloom gelatin.  
2. Add egg yolks and sugar into a bowl and whisk a bit until they become a bit whiter in color.  
3. In a saucepan, mix milk and vanilla and bring to a boil.   
4. As soon as the milk starts to boil, remove it from the heat and pour a thin stream (about hald the milk mixture) onto the egg yolks/sugar, whisking constantly. This is tempering the egg yolks so they wont scramble.   
5. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan with remaining milk and set on low heat.   
6. While constantly mixing/ whisking, bring the mixture up to 170F.  
7. Remove from heat and add in gelatin and stir until fully dissolved.  
8. Stir in the room temp cream cheese.   
9. If the mixture isnt already, let it cool to 85F.  
10. Whip the heavy cream.  
11. Fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture.   
12. Fold in the chocolate shavings.  
 nbsp;  
**Assembly:**  
1. In a larger mold (8in), add about half of the cream cheese mousse.  
2. Next, add the frozen layers of blackberry mousse and jelly and gently push them into the mousse.   
3. Next, lay out the remaining mousse with cream cheese.   
4. Finally, add the layer of sponge cake with blackberry jam and also slightly push it to the mousse.   
5. Add saran wrap to cover/tighten the mold and put into the freezer for a few hours.   
 nbsp;  
**6. Mirror Glaze:**  
100 g white chocolate   
35 g condensed milk  
50 g sugar  
61.25 g corn syrup  
25 ml water  
4 g gelatin (+ about 15 ml water to bloom)  
 nbsp;  
1. Mix gelatin in water until you get an apple sauce consistency.   
2. In a small pot add corn syrup, water, and sugar and bring to a boil.   
3. Add in gelatin and condensed milk. Whisk until gelatin fully dissolved.  
4. In a bowl with the chocolate, add the liquid mixture and whisk until chocolate is fully melted. If you have a hand blender, I highly recommend that you use it to blend the chocolate.   
5. Portion off and add desired food coloring. Do some more hand blending.  
6. Bring the glaze to about room temp.  
 nbsp;  
**Final Decoration:**  
1. After cake has set, remove from mold and set it on top of a smaller bowl or something in a sheet pan.   
2. Pour glaze over, creating desired designs with other colors.  
3. Let the glaze fully drip off. Clean off the surplus drips on the bottom of the cake and then transfer to a serving plate.  
4. Garnish with whatever other fancy stuff you want.  
5. Freeze or refrigerate. The mousse tastes when its not frozen, but even then, still good!  
 nbsp;  
This is a marathon to make. I guarantee it's delicious though! Gluck! </TEXT>

I google translated a recipe I found on Verdade de sabor [Google "**Verdade de sabor torta rubus**"]. She lists both Russian and Portuguese recipes, but each on their own is a bit confusing at times. So I translated both and cross referenced in order to figure out what to do. I'll post a translated recipe that worked for me a bit later.

<TEXT> Hey everyone!,  
I've gotten the mousse cake bug. Well, I've wanted to make one for a while ...they look so beautiful on Insta! I finally got around to making one and of course I used a mirror glaze, since it's a requirement for it to look legit, right? :p  
 nbsp;  
Here's my question. How do you accomplish the spider web glaze technique? I tried doing it with a recipe I found on a forum and it came out so bad (i.e. there was zero effect).  
I used a simple syrup with gelatin and some white food coloring for the "spider web" component.  
 nbsp;  
If any of you have played around with mirror glazes and could offer any pointers, I'd be super grateful!  
Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure, there are 5 main components for the cake, including the macarons (green tea sponge, whipped cream frosting, green tea glaze, green tea macaron shells, strawberry curd filling). The optimal timeline is probably: make the cake and whipped cream and assemble and chill. Make mirror glaze and cool to RT. While that's cooling, make the macarons.  
**1. Matcha Sponge :** [makes 1 jelly roll sheet]  
112g cake flour  
1 tsp baking powder   
16 g matcha powder  
1/4 tsp salt  
5 large eggs, separated  
156 g granulated sugar  
60 g whole milk  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven at 400F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper or silpat.  
2. Whisk together sifted flour, baking powder, green tea and salt.  
3. In a different, large bowl, whisk egg yolks, sugar, and milk until pale.  
4. Separately, whisk egg whites until medium stiff peaks (if you whisk too stiff, it's harder to incorporate).  
5. Add dry mixture to wet mixture and fold together. Then slowly fold in the medium stiff egg whites.  
6. Pour batter onto the baking sheet and then rap the sheet down a few times to release any big air bubbles.  
7. Bake for 9 minutes (a toothpick should go in and out cleanly).  
8. Using a knife or something thin, move along the edge of the pan and cake. Remove cake from pan and silpat and let cool on a baking rack.  
 nbsp;  
Note: I'm guesstimating on amounts for the whipped cream frosting. To make it stabilized, just make a corn starch paste first and add enough to make the whipped cream firm. Also sugar can always be adjusted based on your sweetness preferences.    
 nbsp;  
**2. Stabilized Whipped Cream Frosting:**  
350 g heavy whipping cream  
10 g powdered sugar  
10 g powdered sugar    
10 g corn starch  
some strawberries, not wet and sliced
 nbsp;  
1. Whenever whipping your own cream, make sure the first thing you do is throw your bowl and whisk attachment into the fridge or freezer. Cold is your best friend.  
2. First make your corn starch paste. Add corn starch, one 10g of powdered sugar, and about 100 g of cream and stir in a pot.  
3. Heat over medium, stirring constantly. When it becomes paste-like (you will see a drastic change in the consistency from liquidy to custard like), take the pan off the heat and continue to mix until smooth. Make sure it cools down to room temp (throw in freezer if need be).    
3. Take out chilled bowl and whisk and add the second powdered sugar and remainder of the cream. Whisk until soft peaks.  
4. Whisking at a fast speed, add in the paste (make sure it's not hot!), a bit at a time.  
5. Whisk until stiff peaks.  
6. Remove about 1/3 of the whipped cream and save that for the outside of the cake.  
7. With the remaining 2/3, fold in the strawberries. You could also use whatever other fruit you like. Purees should work too, but just be careful of how much you add to not deflate the whipping cream (I usually make extra whipping cream if I know I'm adding a puree).  
 nbsp;  
**3. Matcha Mirror Glaze:**  
100 g white chocolate  
35 g condensed milk  
50 g sugar  
61.25 g corn syrup  
25 ml water  
4 g gelatin (+ about 15 ml water to bloom)  
3 g matcha powder  
 nbsp;  
1. Mix gelatin in water until you get an apple sauce consistency. 
2. In a small pot add corn syrup, water, matcha powder, and sugar and bring to a boil.  
3. Add in gelatin and condensed milk. Whisk until gelatin fully dissolved.  
4. In a bowl with the chocolate, add the liquid mixture and whisk until chocolate is fully melted. If you have a hand blender, I highly recommend that you use it to blend the chocolate. 
5. Add desired food coloring.  
6. Bring the glaze to room temperature or slightly colder. (You can cover it with cling wrap and throw it in the fridge, but be careful. You don't want it to solidify, but don't want to melt the whipped cream frosting either.)    
 nbsp;  
**4. Matcha Macaron Shells:**   
For about 10 1.5 inch macarons:  
46 g almond flour (sift, no big almond pieces)  
40 g powdered sugar  
2 g matcha powder    
35 g egg whites (room temp)  
35 g granulated sugar  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven to 300F (or 325F, see below). Measure out and sift your powdered sugar, matcha, and almond flour. Whisk together and set aside.  
2. Make your meringue. Beat/ whisk your egg whites until frothy and start to incorporate the granulated sugar a bit a time. Beat until stiff peaks.  
3. Okay. You should look up macaronage (folding of ingredients) on Youtube if you dont know how already. Make sure you set aside some of the batter if you plan to make faces.    
 nbsp;  
In summary: add in dry ingredients to the meringue, a third at a time until mixed. And folding by basically scraping along the edge of the bowl and then pressing down along the center in sort of a J shape. Do this until you have a lava like consistency, where you can pick up your spatula and the batter will drop down in a ribbon. My test is to bang the bowl on the table and see if the ribbon that just fell incorporates back into the main blobif it does, its ready. Otherwise, I do a few more folds. Put into a piping bag.  
 nbsp;  
Add black/ other food coloring to the batter you set aside and fold until the right consistency and put into a bag. (I have tiny piping tips, but if you don't, a sandwich bag with the very very end cut off would work well too.)  
4. Pipe out your macarons. I use a silpat (would highly recommend). Rap the baking sheet against the table a few times. Pipe on derpy faces onto the shells. You could also probably use a toothpick if you're gentle enough.  
5. I hate waiting for the shells to dry, so I cheat and actually put the oven temp at 325. Then I open the oven and hold the tray in the oven, rotating it every 10 seconds or so for about a minute. Then again for another 30 seconds. This quickly dries out the shells :p.  
You want to be able to touch the shell and have it not be sticky. Then I drop down the oven temp back to 300 (its about this low anyways since the door has been open.).  
6. Bake for 15-20 minutes.  
 nbsp;  
**5. Strawberry Curd:**   
5 - 8 strawberries, pureed (you can sieve if you want)         
16 g corn starch  
50 g granulated sugar  
1 egg yolk  
10ish g lemon juice  
28.5 g butter (sometimes less, depending on how thick you make the custard)  
 nbsp;  
1. Add puree to a pot. Heat up until simmering.  
2. Lightly beat the egg yolk and add sugar, sifted corn starch, and lemon juice. Get it so it's not lumpy.  
3. While whisking, slowly add the heated up puree onto the egg/sugar/cornstarch/lemon. You're tempering the egg to prevent it from scrambling. Once it's fully incorporated, add the mixture back into the pot and stir constantly on medium. Eventually, it'll start to thicken. I usually thicken until it's a nice paste.  
4. Take off the heat and stir in the butter, a little a time.  
5. I transfer to a piping bag and chill it in the fridge for a short while to firm up before piping onto my macaron shells.    
 nbsp;  
**Assembly:**  
1. Slice off a small piece for topping decoration. Slice cake into thirds. Remove any obvious crumbs.  
2. Smooth out a layer of strawberry whipped cream between the cake.  
3. Use the normal whipped cream to surround the cake. I go slowly to not get crumbs showing. You can add a small amount then throw it in the fridge. Then add the final amount to cover any crumbs.  
4. Once finished frosting, chill the cake in the fridge or freezer.  
5. When mirror glaze if room temp and the cake is cool, add it over the top, with only small amounts so you can get some nice drips.  
6. Assemble macarons.  
7. Make the top look pretty by adding sliced strawberries, macarons, cake fragments (from that small piece you cut off before you sliced it into thirds), and strawberry curd.  
 nbsp;  
Enjoy!

<TEXT> /u/elevenvt,  
So this was my first time 1. making pistachio macarons and 2. using a buttercream as a filling (I usually prefer curds, as most of the macarons I make are fruit flavored).  
My swiss meringue buttercream is not a normal one because I initially tried making the buttercream from [Sweet and Savory by Shinee] (http://www.sweetandsavorybyshinee.com/pistachio-macarons/), but it was too sweet and too runny, so I made some swiss meringue and incorporated that in. And for the shells, I saw pistachio macaron recipes online were all Italian method, but the ratio of pistachio flour to almond was roughly 1:2, so I followed that for the French method recipe I use.  
 nbsp;  
Macaron Shells  
For about 10 1.5 inch macarons:  
30 g almond flour (sift, no big almond pieces)  
16 g pistachio flour (grind up pistachios, sift)
41.66 g powdered sugar (give or take, since kitchen scales don't have this precision)  
35 g egg whites (room temp)  
35 g granulated sugar  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven to 300F (or 325F, see below). Measure out and sift your powdered sugar and almond flour. Whisk together and set aside.  
2. Make your meringue. Beat/ whisk your egg whites until frothy and start to incorporate the granulated sugar a bit a time. Beat until stiff peaks. If you want food coloring, add it at the soft peaks stage.  
3. Okay. You should look up macaronage (folding of ingredients) on Youtube if you dont know how already.  
In summary: add in dry ingredients to the meringue, a third at a time until mixed. And folding by basically scraping along the edge of the bowl and then pressing down along the center in sort of a J shape. Do this until you have a lava like consistency, where you can pick up your spatula and the batter will drop down in a ribbon. My test is to bang the bowl on the table and see if the ribbon that just fell incorporates back into the main blobif it does, its ready. Otherwise, I do a few more folds. Put into a piping bag.  
4. Pipe out your macarons. I use a silpat (would highly recommend). Rap the baking sheet against the table a few times. 
5. Add larger chunks of pistachios on top.   
6. I hate waiting for the shells to dry, so I cheat and actually put the oven temp at 325. Then I open the oven and hold the tray in the oven, rotating it every 10 seconds or so for about a minute. Then again for another 30 seconds. This quickly dries out the shells :p.  
You want to be able to touch the shell and have it not be sticky. Then I drop down the oven temp back to 300 (its about this low anyways since the door has been open.).  
7. Bake for 15-20 minutes.  
 nbsp;  
Pistachio sort of Swiss Meringue Buttercream  
32.5 g sugar  
15 ml water  
1 egg yolk  
27.5 g butter (softened)  
10-20 g pistachio paste (grind up pistachios and add a bit of water)  
1 egg white  
32.5 g sugar   
 nbsp;    
1. Dissolve one amount of sugar and water in a small saucepan and bring up to 250F to make a syrup.  
2. While heating up syrup, beat egg yolk.  
3. When syrup is ready, slowly pour into bowl while mixing at medium speed until temp drops to 100ishF (smooth and white mixture).  
4. Add the butter, a bit at a time. Then add pistachio paste and food coloring.  
5. Make meringue by putting egg white and second amount of sugar in a bowl and mixing until incorporated.  
6. Put bowl over boiling water and mix until mixture reaches 120F (sugar dissolved), then take off and finish mixing until stiff peaks.  
7. Add meringue, a bit at a time, to the pistachio cream until you get a stiffer filling. I ended up using about 1/4 of the meringue.  
8. Pipe on filling and assemble macarons.  
9. Let the macarons rest in an airtight container in the fridge overnight for optimal chewiness!  
Gluck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ooo, I've recently seen a few videos mentioning those buttercreams but have never tried them (at least I don't think?). I think I'll give it a shot.  
And cooling is probably a good idea. I am usually in a hurry so I only let it chill a short amount of time in the fridge before adding the glaze. Never actually put it in the freezer though (smart!.. a bit disappointed I didn't think to do that on my own :p)  
Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey everyone,  
I have recently been trying to get into making cakes, but I am horrible at making buttercreams. Also, I can't seem to overcome their sweetness. So I've been using whipped cream frostings instead. The issue has been that when I pour mirror glaze over my cakes, the obvious happens and the frosting melts.  
I have two questions:  
 nbsp;  
1. What do you use in lieu of buttercreams if you want to top your cake with glazes?  
2. Do you know of any buttercream recipe that is not overwhelmingly sweet?  
 nbsp;  
Many thanks!

<TEXT> The flavor was very interesting to me. It was the first time I had starfruit, so I was trying to figure out what kind of filling. I'm not a fan of buttercreams, no do I think it would have worked well. Feared the flavor would get drowned out in a ganache. Decided on a curd since it is citrusy ish. :P </TEXT>

<TEXT> /u/Masculine_Apricot,  
 I'm copying and pasting the recipe I posted [previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/5as6dh/homemade_dragonfruit_macarons/). The shells are adapted from Macarons by Natalie and the curd was from a Macaronguy.  
 nbsp;  
Macaron Shells  
For about 10 1.5 inch macarons:  
46 g almond flour (sift, no big almond pieces)  
41.66 g powdered sugar (give or take, since kitchen scales don't have this precision)  
35 g egg whites (room temp)  
35 g granulated sugar  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven to 300F (or 325F, see below). Measure out and sift your powdered sugar and almond flour. Whisk together and set aside.  
2. Make your meringue. Beat/ whisk your egg whites until frothy and start to incorporate the granulated sugar a bit a time. Beat until stiff peaks. If you want food coloring, add it at the soft peaks stage. For these dual color ones, I didn't add it until later.    
3. Okay. You should look up macaronage (folding of ingredients) on Youtube if you dont know how already.  
 nbsp;  
In summary: add in dry ingredients to the meringue, a third at a time until mixed. And folding by basically scraping along the edge of the bowl and then pressing down along the center in sort of a J shape. Do this until you have a lava like consistency, where you can pick up your spatula and the batter will drop down in a ribbon. My test is to bang the bowl on the table and see if the ribbon that just fell incorporates back into the main blobif it does, its ready. Otherwise, I do a few more folds. Put into a piping bag.   
 nbsp;  
For dual color, I incorporated dry ingredients with meringue gently, then separated the mixture into two. Added food coloring to one half. Fold both batters to the right consistency and put into separate piping bags without tips. Then put both piping bags into a piping bag with a tip, so when you squeeze, you're squeezing both bags into the tip. Here's a [Honey and Butter video](https://www.instagram.com/p/BNlEFymFxy-/) from earlier this month showing what I mean.   
4. Pipe out your macarons. I use a silpat (would highly recommend). Rap the baking sheet against the table a few times.  
5. I hate waiting for the shells to dry, so I cheat and actually put the oven temp at 325. Then I open the oven and hold the tray in the oven, rotating it every 10 seconds or so for about a minute. Then again for another 30 seconds. This quickly dries out the shells :p.  
You want to be able to touch the shell and have it not be sticky. Then I drop down the oven temp back to 300 (its about this low anyways since the door has been open.).  
6. Bake for 15-20 minutes.  
 nbsp;  
Star Fruit Curd  
3/4 star fruit (that way you can use the other 1/4 in your picture :D      
16 g corn starch  
50 g granulated sugar  
1 egg yolk  
10ish g lemon juice  
28.5 g butter (sometimes less, depending on how thick your )  
 nbsp;  
1. Puree and strain. Heat up until simmering.  
2. Lightly beat the egg yolk and add sugar and sifted corn starch. I also just add the lemon juice, so that I can make a nice non-lumpy mixture.  
3. While whisking, slowly add the heated up juice onto the egg/sugar/cornstarch/lemon. You're tempering the egg to prevent it from scrambling. Once it's fully incorporated, add the mixture back into the pot and stir constantly on medium. Eventually, it'll start to thicken. I usually thicken until it's a nice paste.  
4. Take off the heat and stir in the butter, a little a time.  
5. I transfer to a piping bag and chill it in the fridge for a short while to firm up before piping onto my macaron shells.    
6. Let the macarons rest in an airtight container in the fridge overnight for optimal chewiness! The flavor tasted much better after resting as well.  
Gluck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> /u/maizycorn,  
Here's the recipe. For the puree, just peel a guava and chop it up in a processor and sieve out the seeds and lumps.  
 nbsp;  
**Crepes**  
650 g milk, room temperature!  
240 g flour  
90 g sugar  
4 eggs  
50 g butter, melted  
70 g guava puree (you don't need fruit puree, but if you do, add a little less milk)  
 nbsp;  
1. Sift flour into a large bowl.  
2. Add sugar and mix briefly (I use a whisk).    
3. Add in eggs and mix.  
4. Add in milk, slowly at a time. Once about half the milk is added and mixed, add the rest and the guava puree.    
5. Add melted butter and mix fully.  
6. Pour mixture through a sieve. Want runny consistency.  
7. Cling wrap and throw into fridge for at least 30 minutes. Longer is better.  
8. After mixture has become cold, take a pan and on low to medium heat, add a small amount of batter. It takes some trial and error to figure out the right about to cover your pan.  
9. When the edges of the crepe become dry (a minute or so), flip over and cook for a short while longer (1 minute).  
10. Repeat.  
11. To get a consistent size, place a bowl or something circular over the crepe and cut off excess scraps.  
12. Let crepes cool completely before assembling.  
 nbsp;  
**Pastry Cream**    
4 large egg yolks  
37 g cornstarch  
340 g milk  
100 g sugar  
70 g guava (or more, to taste)
225 g heavy cream  
10 g powdered sugar  
 nbsp;  
You need to make a custard and a whipped cream. Take your large bowl and whisk that you're going to make the whipped cream with and throw that into the fridge before you begin. You want it cold.  
1. First prepare **custard component**. In a large bowl, combine egg yolks and cornstarch.  
2. In a saucepan, high heat, combine milk, sugar, and puree. [NOTE, if you're using a different fruit that's acidic, it will curdle so instead fold puree into custard.]  
3. Bring to boil and remove from heat.  
4. While whisking constantly, slowly add to bowl with yolks and cornstarch. You are tempering the egg yolks so that they won't scramble.  
5. Return the mixture to the saucepan on high heat.  
6. Bring to rolling boil, while whisking/ mixing constantly. The mixture will become custard like.  
7. Sieve through a fine mesh into a bowl and cover the bowl with cling wrap. Make sure to press it directly onto the custard to avoid condensation.  
8. Chill.  
9. Now prepare **whipped cream** component.  Take out the chilled bowl, whisk, and cream. 
10. Add cream and powdered sugar and whisk until firm peaks.  
11. Take out guava custard and whisk a bit to loosen it up. Add a small amount of whipped cream to lighten the mixture even more.  
12. Slowly fold in the rest of the whipped cream, making sure not to overfold (will deflate the cream).   
 nbsp;  
**Assembly**  
1. Assemble the cake on whatever you want it to be served on. These cakes are difficult to transfer.   
2. Lay down a crepe and then add some pastry cream. Spread it out to an even amount.  
3. Add another crepe.  Then some more pastry cream.  
4. Repeat.  
5. Every few crepes, use something that's flat to press down onto the cake to help even it out. The edge of the cake will inevitably have less pastry cream than the center.  
6. Once assembled, refrigerate for a few hours (will make it so much easier to cut into).  
7. Top with powdered sugar.  
8. Enjoy! </TEXT>

<TEXT> But also, you need to keep trying and pinpoint where exactly the issue is coming from. May be from baking time, stiffness of meringue, ratio of ingredients, or macaronage. Just keep trying and hopefully you'll be able to solve the hollow problem! But yes, when I do French method, I still get hollows sometimes to varying degrees, but basically don't get them if I do Italian. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can definitely try making it without any sponge cake and just layer the ice cream (I'm sure it'd be just as tasty!) The nice thing about this no churn ice cream is that it's thick enough to be piped on as soon as you make it. So you can just pipe each layer, even it out, then move onto the next layer.  
Or maybe you can try using a [gluten free sponge recipe] (http://glutenfreeonashoestring.com/gluten-free-strawberry-cake-roll/). I just googled it, but I'm sure you can find another recipe. I like using roll cake recipes because the sheets bake quickly and are even!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Once I started posting on social media, I started making stuff every few days. When you make fattening foods this often, you learn to limit yourself :p. BUT, I definitely ate all the extra batter/ ice cream that didn't make it into the piping bag.  
ALSO, the cake will melt, so I can't bring it across the city to work. Therefore, I have to eat a slice every night with dinner. haha </TEXT>

<TEXT> /u/MiniMobBokoblin, /u/spirallix, /u/PiersonA ,  
For this particular recipe, there are 5 main components: the sponge layers, cranberry puree (used in ice cream and glaze), the ice cream layers, the whipped cream frosting, and the mirror glaze. The recipe seems a bit daunting, but it's pretty fool-proof and tastes great!  
 nbsp;  
The sponge is based off [The Little Eppicurian](http://www.thelittleepicurean.com/2014/03/matcha-green-tea-swiss-roll-strawberry-mousse.html).  
**1. Sponge :** [makes 1 jelly roll sheet]  
112g cake flour  
1 tsp baking powder   
1/4 tsp salt  
5 large eggs, separated  
156 g granulated sugar  
60 g whole milk  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven at 400F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper or silpat.  
2. Whisk together sifted flour, baking powder, and salt.  
3. In a different, large bowl, whisk egg yolks, sugar, and milk until pale.  
4. Separately, whisk egg whites until medium stiff peaks (if you whisk too stiff, it's harder to incorporate).  
5. Add dry mixture to wet mixture and fold together. Then slowly fold in the medium stiff egg whites.  
6. Pour batter onto the baking sheet and then rap the sheet down a few times to release any big air bubbles.  
7. Bake for 8-9 minutes (a toothpick should go in and out cleanly).  
8. Invert cake, remove silpat or parchment paper, then add a clean silpat/ new parchment paper and revert.  
9. Let cool.  
 nbsp;  
The ice cream is a no-churn variety from [Food Network](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/no-churn-vanilla-ice-cream.html)  
**2. Cranberry Puree:**  
450 g cranberries  
240 ml water  
 nbsp;  
1. Add cranberries and water in a pot and heat on high.  
2. Let cranberries pop and when they look soft, mash up the cranberries until you get an apple sauce like consistency. If it's too liquidy, keep mixing over high heat until it reduces.  
3. Pass through a fine mesh strainer and cool.  
 nbsp;  
**3. No Churn Ice cream:**  
396 g (14 oz can) condensed milk  
2 tsp vanilla extract  
pinch of salt  
470 g heavy whipping cream  
75 g cranberry puree
 nbsp;  
1. Whip the whipping cream to stiff peaks.  
2. Whisk in the condensed milk.  
**--** Vanilla base complete.  
3. If adding in flavors (in this case, cranberry), fold in about 75g cranberry puree). [I did it to taste.]  
 nbsp;  
**Cake Assembly:**  
1. Line a cake pan with parchment paper.  
2. Lay down a piece of cake.  
3. Add ice cream bases to piping bags and pipe onto the cake layer you put down.  
4. Add another piece of cake.   5. Continue layering until you reach the top of your cake pan.  
6. Freeze for at least 6 hours.  
 nbsp;  
**4. Whipped Cream Frosting:**  
235 g heavy whipping cream  
30 g powdered sugar (give or take, to taste depending on how sweet you want it)  
2 g gelatin  
10-15 ml water  
 nbsp;  
1. Add water to gelatin and mix until apple sauce consistency.  
2. Heat for about 30 seconds until liquid.  
3. Whisk whipping cream and slowly add in liquid gelatin. Whisk until stiff peaks.  
 nbsp;  
This glaze was adapted from [RosannaPansino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZhV63pkDBw). Skipping out on the condensed milk makes it very sticky (I've made this mistake before), so don't do that.   
**5. Cranberry Mirror Glaze:**  
55 g white chocolate (chopped up finely to help melting)  
35 g condensed milk  
50 g sugar  
61.25 g corn syrup  
25 ml water  
4 g gelatin (+ about 15 ml water to bloom)  
60ish g cranberry puree  
 nbsp;  
1. Mix gelatin in water until you get an apple sauce consistency. 
2. In a small pot add corn syrup, water, and sugar and bring to a boil.  
3. Add in gelatin and condensed milk. Whisk until gelatin fully dissolved.  
4. In a bowl with the chocolate, add the liquid mixture and whisk until chocolate is fully melted.  
5. Add cranberry puree (I added about 60g, but was doing it to taste [to overpower the white chocolate flavor].  
6. Bring the glaze to room temperature or slightly colder. (You can cover it with cling wrap and throw it in the fridge, but be careful. You don't want it to solidify, but don't want to melt the whipped cream frosting either.)  
 nbsp;  
**Decoration:**  
1. Pull out the ice cream cake (should be easy if you lined out the cake pan with parchment paper) and place on cake board [I just use cardboard wrapped with foil] or plate.  
2. Start to cover the cake with a small amount of whipped cream frosting to serve as a "crumb" coat. Freeze for a few minutes.  
3. Add the rest of the whipped cream frosting.  
4. Freeze for 10ish minutes.  
5. Add glaze to a piping bag and make drips around the edge of the cake.   
6. Fill in the rest of the top.  
7. Decorate however else you like. I used [macarons and cranberries](http://bit.ly/2gIf2Hg).  
8. Freeze until ready to serve and enjoy! :D   </TEXT>

I know sometimes people don't like that so many of Lette's filings are ganache, but I think they're done very well. Definitely my go-to when I go to LA. Although, Laduree is making its way to the Grove in the near future,  which will be nice. I still think I like Lette better though. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Haha basically. Ever since I saw a macaron with a curd filling, I've been in love with them. I used to always make white chocolate ganaches (I never liked the taste of buttercreams), but would have issues if the fruit had a subtle flavor, so it wasn't able to cut through the richness of the white chocolate.  
I don't really have this issue with curds. Well, it's a slightly different problem. For non-citrus curds, I use some lemon juice and this can be a bit overwhelming if the fruit is super subtle (like dragonfruit).   
That, and I'd always just guesstimate how much cream to add and would always end up splitting my ganache. I was getting tired of frantically running around trying to save it. (I really wish I could replicate good ganaches I try at places like Kesourine and Chantal Guillon in the Bay Area or Lette in SoCal).  
Oh, also I am pretty happy with how curds absorb super nicely into the shell. I used to always make my ganaches too thick, so they wouldn't really absorb and leave a cruchy macaron -__-.  
My favorite filling, by far, was a taro halaya [I've also really liked ube halayas]. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do. For the shell at least. The filling for this was a mixture between a curd and a ganache because I skipped an ingredient for the curd and it never thickened, so I added some white chocolate. I'm sure a curd, made well would have been fine though.  I'm copying and pasting the recipe I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/5as6dh/homemade_dragonfruit_macarons/) or from [Mario'z Eats](http://bit.ly/2eT7P74).  
 nbsp;  
Macaron Shells  
For about 10 1.5 inch macarons:  
46 g almond flour (sift, no big almond pieces)  
41.66 g powdered sugar (give or take, since kitchen scales don't have this precision)  
35 g egg whites (room temp)  
35 g granulated sugar  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven to 300F (or 325F, see below). Measure out and sift your powdered sugar and almond flour. Whisk together and set aside.  
2. Make your meringue. Beat/ whisk your egg whites until frothy and start to incorporate the granulated sugar a bit a time. Beat until stiff peaks. If you want food coloring, add it at the soft peaks stage.  
3. Okay. You should look up macaronage (folding of ingredients) on Youtube if you dont know how already.  
In summary: add in dry ingredients to the meringue, a third at a time until mixed. And folding by basically scraping along the edge of the bowl and then pressing down along the center in sort of a J shape. Do this until you have a lava like consistency, where you can pick up your spatula and the batter will drop down in a ribbon. My test is to bang the bowl on the table and see if the ribbon that just fell incorporates back into the main blobif it does, its ready. Otherwise, I do a few more folds. Put into a piping bag.  
4. Pipe out your macarons. I use a silpat (would highly recommend). Rap the baking sheet against the table a few times.  
5. I hate waiting for the shells to dry, so I cheat and actually put the oven temp at 325. Then I open the oven and hold the tray in the oven, rotating it every 10 seconds or so for about a minute. Then again for another 30 seconds. This quickly dries out the shells :p.  
You want to be able to touch the shell and have it not be sticky. Then I drop down the oven temp back to 300 (its about this low anyways since the door has been open.).  
6. Bake for 15-20 minutes.  
 nbsp;  
Rambutan Curd  
1 cup fruit of choice pureed (this doesn't have to be super precise, since you can always just reduce down your mixture for a longer or shorter time) [for these rambutan ones, I pureed 5]    
50 g granulated sugar  
16 g cornstarch  
1 egg yolk  
10ish g lemon juice  
28.5 g butter (sometimes less)  
 nbsp;  
1. Puree and strain. Heat up until simmering.  
2. Lightly beat the egg yolk and add sugar and sifted corn starch. I also just add the lemon juice, so that I can make a nice non-lumpy mixture.  
3. While whisking, slowly add the heated up juice onto the egg/sugar/cornstarch/lemon. You're tempering the egg to prevent it from scrambling. Once it's fully incorporated, add the mixture back into the pot and stir constantly on medium. Eventually, it'll start to thicken. I usually thicken until it's a nice paste.  
4. Take off the heat and stir in the butter, a little a time.  
5. I transfer to a piping bag and chill it in the fridge for a short while to firm up before piping onto my macaron shells.  
6. See my post above on how to do the swirl thing.  
7. Let the macarons rest in an airtight container in the fridge overnight for optimal chewiness! The flavor tasted much better after resting as well.  
Gluck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just make sure not to overfold your egg whites into the rest of your batter. If you haven't made a sponge before, check out videos on Youtube on how to make a roll cake. This recipe interestingly doesn't have you make a meringue and instead just has you beat the egg whites. Still worked, though.  
Also, it says use medium peaks. I think I did stiff peaks and I had some difficulty fully incorporating without deflating. So yea, would recommend taking it to medium.   
Gluck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure thing. I followed the recipe from [The Little Epicurian] (http://www.thelittleepicurean.com/2014/03/matcha-green-tea-swiss-roll-strawberry-mousse.html) .  
I filled it with a guava whipped cream. I used 3/4 a guava to make the puree and cut up the other 1/4 and placed it in the whipped cream before rolling. I didn't add any gelatin and I also found that her recipe involves wayyy too much cream. I only used about 235 g  (1 cup) of whipping cream. 250 g will probably be safe.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> And for the recipe: make two different lava cake bases, one dark chocolate and one guava.  
This is only for like 4ish servings.  
NOTE: The guava puree made the base a bit runny, so I threw it in the fridge to cool a bit before piping it into the ramekin.

69g chocolate [dark or white depending on base]  
20g butter  
40g sugar  
1 egg  
35 g guava puree  (strained)
25g flour  
 nbsp;  
1. Melt chocolate and butter over a double boiler.  
2. Take off double boiler. Stir in sugar and mix until smooth.  
3. Add egg. Mix.  
4. If guava base, add this now. Mix.  
5. Sift in flour (or add presifted flour). Stir until smooth and put into a piping bag.  
6. Pipe the chocolate base (I go in swirls from center outward and then along the sides.) to "coat" the ramekin. Then pipe the guava base within this chocolate one. Finally cover up the top with more chocolate base. Chill in fridge for a bit (10-15min is probably fine). I actually didn't chill these guava ones and they were okay. However, I think I got lucky.  
7. Bake at 450F for 9.5 min (that's what I did and it worked). I scrape along the sides of the ramekin and then put a plate on top and flip over.   
Try a single tester one first to see if it's able to come out nicely. If too runny, go for another minute and not runny, then bake for less. When it's in the oven, the center should not be drooping down and should not look wet.

I plated it over some guava puree, which helped add some more freshness. </TEXT>
