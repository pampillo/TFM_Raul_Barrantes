<TEXT> Considering that arbers have (allegedly) been able to shrink the gap between BFX and GDAX/GEMINI etc, would you expect the price to reenter the multi-year channel once everyone who wanted out of BFX did so? Or is it terminated once we get out for a while?

Am I wrong to keep that channel in such high regard? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dont need to hit the top, i just don't want to sell at 1800 if I could sell at 3500. I dont want to miss the peak and then baghold like i did for years hoping it bubbles again. 

If it would stay in this tight channel I probably wouldnt sell a single one, its the bubbles and crashes that are bothering me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am looking for a new leather work bag, mainly its going to hold all the crap that would otherwise go in my pockets as well as a Macbook Air. Budget is around $150 or less. The look I am going for is nice business casual, I dont wear a suit to work, wool dress pants if I have client meetings or a tradeshow.

It should have an opening at the top, not a folding flap. I also need the option of shoulder strap as well as handles.

<TEXT> Hello,

I received a quote for website rebuild for $1800.

Its a simple website with about 400 items listed for sale, they will be broken into several categories and subcategories. All of the items will be uploaded via spreadhseet and the pictures via FTP, probably by me, not the dev.

the quote lists the job as:

1. Improve visual layout.
Update site to use responsive AJAX layout.
Will be compatible with all browsers and devices.
Will have modern, clean layout and graphics.
2. Improve Functionality with product import module.
Products will be able to be added or updated en masse through upload of CSV file.
Images will be uploaded separately through FTP and linked to items by name in CSV file.

It wont even have a functioning shopping cart as we dont sell online, it will tell people to call for delivery options.

I feel like this is pretty high in 2017 when there are tons of plug and play options for pretty much everything.

Can one of you Magicians please share some insight? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I am on the road and trying (and succeeding) to maintain ketosis but goddam I hate the food industry. 

I just bought a spinach, egg   feta cheese wrap and was planning on just eating the filling. I admit that I ended up eating the whole thing since it smelled so good toasted.

 According to the label, it had 19g net carbs so I decided I could be extra careful for the rest of the day if I indulged. The problem is that for some reason its acceptable to call a small wrap 2 servings instead of one. This wasnt even a big wrap, it was more or less the size of my fist, I never even considered that it was two servings.

<TEXT> So I have been lurking here for a few weeks and I officially went keto Sunday morning. I ate 3 eggs with cheeses for breakfast, a cup of plain chobani with cut up veggies for lunch, dinner was a couple of chicken breasts with fried eggplants (olive oil). I havent been getting crazy with macros or anything but my goal was staying under 20 net carbs and I did. 

I woke up this morning super tired, and I have had anxiety in the pit of my stomach until about noontime. (Same breakfast and lunch btw). I was also super irritable yesterday before dinner as well at around 11am today. 

This is really weird for me as I dont normally have these emotions and Im wondering if this is all in my head or if I am in some kind of withdrawal. I used to eat rice, bread, pasta or potatoes at least once a day in a hige portion so it makes sense that something is missing but does it happen this quickly? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The flaw in your logic is that because a bunch of bad guys killed a ton of jews a long time ago, we should keep up with tradition. 

Never mind that the main reason they killed the jews was the same reason the Church had so much fun hunting Lutherans as well as literally every single other group, they werent following strict Catholic doctrine. 

We forget that pretty much all of our history from this era was what was written down by abbots and monks. If they decided the jews poisoned the well then all the jews got killed. It had nothing to do with them not wanting to convert, for sure.

<TEXT> I hope nobody is naive enough to think that the Chinese withdrawal ban is accidentally going to end around the time of the SEC decision. 

The goal by the PBOC is to have the price go to goblin town before the decision so it scares the overly cautious SEC paper pushers. The price of btc is going to keep going down as people need to cash out to fiat so they can withdraw. There is probably no bottom to the price in this kind of situation. 

I dont think "bitcoin is dead" but we are going down for a while to come. I am not going to sell my stash but alot of people will.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There are almost half a million untested rape kits in the USA, it would be an objectively *good* thing to test them and throw the criminals into a deep dark prison.

The second benefit is forcing CNN and JigglyHuffPo to claim its somehow bad since it will cause more illegal immigrants to go to jail.

This isnt Saudi Arabia after all, we aren't supposed to let this happen here. </TEXT>

In my opinion, when you provide labor for a company they are supposed to compensate you with a pay check. Why does a business owner have to pay a salary and give up the business to his employees?

<TEXT> You are probably suggesting that owners and investors are the same, i would obviously have to agree. 

I guess I see investors as a bank or angel who funded the bagel shop on the corner with $50k, the owner is the guy who also put in $50k but is sweating behind the counter and feels responsible for his 4 employees that need to get paid on friday. Thats the average business in America, is it not? </TEXT>

<TEXT> R/personalfinance is great, these deals function much like REITs do, that sub will set you well on your way. 

One thing tho, alot of what I know and do is a direct result of what my father did. While he didnt give me money, he did give me the opportunity to grow wealth in a manner not usually available to the average person. You usually need a high net worth to invest in these projects. So in some ways, liberals are correct when they say that it matters who your parents are. On the other hand, when my dad got to to America he was sweeping floors in an electronics store in NYC, so take everything with a grain of salt.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can only speak to my experience and my dads. I am not privy to anyone elses financial info. 

We *most definitely* take advantage with deductions but you need to understand these are legitimate and for anyone to use. 

For example, I gave almost $15k to charity in 2016, my dad gave way more, why shouldnt we itemize for that deduction? If the average person is too poor to give as big of a percentage to taxes as I did, would you prefer to penalize me so I wont donate?

In regards to investments, we own shares in multifamily as well commercial developments in the US. We typically receive a K1 every year showing we had a loss on the property. This allows us to write off profits we did receive from other deals. The final year of the investment is when we sell the property and we have a huge profit on record. What most people get confused by is they think this erases the tax burden on profits when it actually is *deferred*, the government understands you may have had a loss this year but they will definitely take whats coming to them as soon as you have a profit. 

Feel free to keep asking questions, i will amswer as best i can </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I agree with the basic principles, I believe you are mistaken on a couple of points. Islam didnt regress in the 12th century because of takers. Their cities and kingdoms were absolutely obliterated by yhe Mongol Invasions. Imagine a territory from the Chinese coast of the Pacific stretching all the way to Aleppo in Syria. The Mongols killed and raped everything in between. Many historians believe that Baghdads population didnt recover to pre-Mongol levels until the *early 1900s*. Population centers in Afghanistan are still being dug up. Turkey and Iran were rekt as well. There is no question that European dominance in the last couple hundred years is related to the damage the Mongols did to China and the Islamic world. 

In regards to Givers, Takers and Destroyers you are absolutely correct. The Givers in the ME were all killed by mongol Destroyers in the 1200s. The Roman Empire was destroyed by letting in all the Takers who used to be Destroyers (Germanic barbarians like the Goth and Vandals) </TEXT>

The whole point is that its cheap to send txs + you can send alot of txs, that means that in the future when block rewards are small you will make money off of tx fees. If people cant send bitcoin txs, but must rather use some proprietary system then bitcoin will not be bitcoin and miners wont make anything. </TEXT>

the point is we want more people to use bitcoin. If there are more transactions to put in a block, miners will make more money.

<TEXT> Proponents of Socialism love to tell everyone how the failed Socialist countries all over the world dont count as true examples of Socialism since they are all Totalitarian. What they dont understand is the simple fact that if citizens were allowed to think for a moment, many would come to the conclusion that they were living in a failed state. 

If Fidel Castro didnt kill everyone who breathed differently than him, people would have rebelled after the first few years. If Stalin and Mao didnt purge millions of forgotten men women and children who were innocent of everything except for thoughtcrimes, the people would have strung them up. 

There is a reason that the moment a country goes Communist every basic civil liberty goes out the window. There is a reason there is a blanket ban on any original art, poetry, music and film. They cant have anyone spreading the truth about how shitty everything really is. 

People who claim to be Socialist are monsters and they dont even know what they would end up having to do once in power.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-11-15 02:49:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In 2007 John Oliver was working on the Daily Show. He had a visitor's visa at the time which allowed him to work.

BUT in 2007 there was a writer's strike, and John Oliver went out on strike AND even carried a union picket sign.

Here's a picture of him going on strike and illegally walking the picket line:

http://gothamist.com/2007/11/15/john_oliver_wri.php

Foreigner's are not allowed to participate in a union strike. In fact it's grounds for deportation. This is tantamount to voting while being a non-citizen.

The irony is... he came to the U.S. because it's more free than the U.K. when it comes to freedom of speech laws. Yet he is constantly toting the Democrat line when it comes to the restriction of free speech.

Let's get him out of here. At the very least this can keep him from getting citizenship. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey Guys,

So i just decided to quit smoking *again* and I have two devices that have been sitting on my desk for the last 6 months without being used.

One of them is an Evic-VT with a built in battery, the other is a Dovpo Executive 5.0 with an 18650.

Both devices haven't been charged in months and they both claim that the batteries are about 100% fully charged.

My question is it is safe to use either device and if not, what do I do for the Evic-VT as it is not user replaceable.

thanks, </TEXT>
