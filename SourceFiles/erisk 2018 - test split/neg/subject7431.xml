<TEXT>  Flynn associates had been subpoenaed

Can you explain this? I would read it as the courts are investigating wrongdoing by Flynn's associates and have requested them to appear to explain themselves, but that doesn't seem to fit with the narrative.  
EDIT: OK, now I understand that Flynn was in cahoots with Trump, and it's back fired. I thought it was the FBI (and therefor Flynn) who was investigating Trump! Thanks guys! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I can see how you could sacrifice a crap player to take out another star player. But this can be in any sport (I agree the nature of ice hokey makes it easier to make it look like an accident over something like curling!). But I fail to see how a fight solves this? The guy can still take out the star player, then have a fight (or just keep his gloves on). How does a fight stop this? (genuine question, I acknowledge I know almost nothing of the sport)  
 Plus it's an accepted tradition, basically.

No, but it does make progress to scoring a point, or reduce the chance of an opponent scoring points in a legitimate manner.  
Also, without reading the whole rule book, your excerpt alone proves nothing other than how a fight is defined, not whether it is a tactic, or indeed permissible. I'm not familiar with the rules (and haven't read the whole link you sent) so happy to be proved otherwise. You made a better argument than I've heard anyone else make :) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  keep people from going after your star players  

In what way? "Going after" as in assaulting? If so, why are they not just charged with assault? or "Going after" in an attack play? Then why do they have to resort to violence to win the game?  
  
 both players have to drop the gloves  
  
I've heard this before and honestly wish they would keep their gloves on. It ruins what looks like an otherwise awesome sport.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  eliminating it would make much more dangerous fouls go dramatically up in frequency

I honestly fail to understand this. Does the sport attract violent people who are bad sportsmen unable to adhere to the rules? As for being fast paced, in the professional league then I'm assuming they'd have enough cameras and slow mo replays, and even a ref assigned to watch every single player. This would eliminate any injustice by someone flaunting the rules without their victim having to resort to martial law. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hockey? Really? Or do you mean Ice Hockey? I'm not sure about those rules, but is it really part of the game play? As in, do you score points? If not, then it's just tolerated assault so still wrong in my books (and legally).  
Rugby, nope! Being a contact sport and ending up bloody is not the same as intending to harm someone. Most rugby players have great sportsmanship anyway. </TEXT>

"State by state"...? Are you American? Are you aware that the US is only about 4% of the world? Many other countries/cultures seem to cope fine with "overheating" even in 45 degrees (113 F) heat whilst maintaining modesty. How do they do this? I'm not saying they should have to, just asking how they cope.  
That said, I was not arguing for a case, I was merely highlighting a difference between breastfeeding, and breastfeeding-with-breast-exposed to highlight that the issue is not with the breastfeeding, but the exposed breast. I did not infer my opinion nor was I advocating support for or against breastfeeding with, or without, breast exposed. </TEXT>

Exposing breasts in public is not considered acceptable in most places (though I'm sure a lot of the neck beards here will chirp up now). This is what gets people upset, not the act of breastfeeding. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I don't think we disagree. I mentioned that the roast can either be very light (e.g. Saudi) or very dark (e.g. Jordan) so there's not a specific "Arabic roast".  
As for the beans themselves, yes they can come from Yemen (see my note about Mocha) but you don't need that to make Arabic coffee. I'm not going to get into the Arabica as a species, as I don't think that's relevant here. But most beans you will buy here will be from Colombia or Africa, and are still perfectly suited to make a good Arabic coffee, I.e. Yemeni beans not required.  
However, I do believe discussing the plantations or even whether you should stop the roast at the first pop is well away from what OP was asking. They were more likely asking about the pre-blended coffee... about which I will concede that I know very little... </TEXT>

It's also important to understand the difference in the case of having to leave no ambiguity. The teacher may be being pedantic, but then clients can also be equally as pedantic if they bring any legal case about something you've inadvertently promised due to an ambiguity (equally, it can get you out of a legal issue if they used a term incorrectly too). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why not just get the beans from the US?  
As the resident /r/Dubai coffee expert and advocate of Raw Coffee Co: If you want to get good beans from UAE, just go to Raw Coffee Co. Qahwah beans are no different from your regular beans. The "Arabic coffee" as a drink is actually more in the preparation rather than the beans. The roasting can range from a VERY light roast, right through to dark, depending on part of Arabia. The preparation is what really distinguishes Arabic Coffee from regular (European) coffee; for example by adding cardamom. If you're looking to get the beans, then there's no specific "Arabic Coffee" beans, but if you want pre-mixed-and-ground coffee... not sure where's best (I don't get pre-made).  
That said, I have also been looking for a nice, *good quality* dallah, but have so far been unsuccessful, and only found the plasticy/insulated ones. Please PM me if you find a good place.  
Bonus Arabian coffee fun fact: The "Caff Mocha" comes from the coffee that was exported from ["Mocha" in Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mocha_coffee_bean), which has a distinctive chocolatey taste. It was more recently when they started to add the chocolate to any old coffee and call it a "Caff Mocha" </TEXT>

<TEXT> They're not mutually exclusive, at least from and Islamic point of view. Stephen Hawking's brief history of time deals with some interesting aspects of the initial state of the universe and how it came to so orderly (at least where we are) when entropy is always increasing. In reading more about science and our origins, I have never found anything which contradicts my Islamic beliefs, and if anything they are strengthened when learning more about science. I think this is a big difference with Christianity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the recommendation, I will try and check it out but life is hectic at the moment so might not have time for a while. However, based solely on the title, and your very short description of "both sides", I'm guessing this looks at the arguments for evolution and religion? If so, is it specifically Christianity? If so, then I can see that there is a debate. However, for info, the theory of evolution and Islam are not inherently incompatible. There is nothing in Islam which states that there were not dinosaurs, nor that species cannot adapt and evolve.

<TEXT> "Disproving existence of the Christian God"? I think you mean, "disproving Christianity". Although the Bible is a very unreliable text, to claim it "disproves" is a bit much. I agree it doesn't prove the existence either. That said "Christianity" and "religion" are not synonymous as a lot of Redditors seem to think (not saying you, here). I get irate when there's a whole "science beats religion" argument, when in fact what they mean to say is "science beats Christianity" </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Ryanair is basic

When you just want to get from A to B, cheap, no frills, on time, then they're spot on. Good customer service in my experience.  
As for extra charges, they're just taking them out the cost of the ticket. One could fly BA, and get full meals, and luggage etc, but pay 100 more for a ticket. Well, I don't need a meal, and only have cabin bags, so why should I pay those "extra charges" when I don't need them? I appreciate that I'm purely basing it off my own experience so not exactly a great sample size. But I'm a frequent flyer on multiple airlines around the world so have a fair amount of references. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well done, you arguably proved there are exceptions. I was saying that some colours just look better on cars. Just drive through your nearest town, and count how many silver and black cars you see. Then count how many pink, lime green and brown cars you see. Of the latter classification, tell me how many looked good. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  not every Westerner would have the idealogy that people should learn English

The French, for example ;)  
And yeah, people learn at different rates so making it compulsory would be a bit harsh. But the effort should be there if you intend to spend more than a couple of years in a country. </TEXT>

You saying that it's not likely that westerners expect foreign speakers to learn their language? Actually, it is a very common sentiment. And actually one that I don't necessarily disagree with. I think there should at least be an effort to learn the local language.

<TEXT> Oh ok, no probs. But yeah for info, the compact cameras and phones etc will have software in which actually puts "filters" on to make them more vivid. They detect the subject and apply them automatically, e.g., Sky more blue and trees more green. At the very least it will auto detect the white balance. Even DSLRs will apply this (though not as much) if saving as JPG. A true "non edited" photo will be the "raw" file. They look very bland, and when my friends want to see my photographs immediately after I shoot it because I have "expensive cameras" they assume they are good. They need to be post processed to get them looking like what you image.

<TEXT> But if I've never cooked it before, how do I know what my taste is. The one writing the recipe should define it as it they were doing it. If it was to taste, I wouldn't be making this casserole, I'd order a pizza. The chef at a restaurant doesn't ask me how much salt to put in, he just does it, and that's what a recipe should do.  
I concede that weighing a pinch of salt might be difficult, but a fraction of a teaspoon might be good (although i have issues with the non standard sizes of spoons too).

I'm not gonna start spewing about hints of elder flower and berry here. Just give them a rough idea of what you like and they'll suggest one. They don't expect everyone to be a cupping expert so don't judge is you simply say "I like it strong".  
That said, my favourite is definitely the Yirgacheffe. It's been my bean of choice since living in the UK. But it's all down to personal preference. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be honest, the best coffee is the one that you enjoy. If you enjoy instant, then fine, ain't gonna judge you for that (I will... (na, just kidding))  
However, I would implore you to go to RAW and just get a latte. You will enjoy it, but won't necessarily see why it's so much nicer after one cup, and will think it tastes roughly the same. When you have it a few times, and then go BACK to drinking other stuff... THAT'S when you'll realise how bitter and harsh they taste, and you'll appreciate what it is to have good coffee :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, wasn't my taste. I prefer Arfican coffee. My favourite plantation is in Yirgacheffe, Ethopia. I was elated when I moved here and found RAW supplied this! :D  
If you're thinking of trying Kopi Luwak, make sure it's the real stuff, not the fake crap (no pun intended). The benefit of this coffee is two stage; the second only being the fact that it's been exposed to the gastric juices. The primary is the fact that the cats have the ability to seek out only the ripest berries, thus getting you the best stuff. The fake "Kopi Luwak" is where they just feed coffee to caged civet cats, and harvest the poop. Not only is this unethical, but it defeats the primary object of having your top quality coffee pickers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As mentioned in another comment, I'm very fussy about my coffee. I've travelled the world discovering coffee, and some of my favourite places back home are Prufrock and Nude Espresso in London. I used to get coffee from Has Bean, Sq Mile, and Alchemy coffee in the UK. RAW coffee can compete at the highest international standard.  
They are more pricey than supermarket coffee, but supermarket coffee (yes, including Illy and the "posh" looking ones) is old and stale. You should consume within about 21 days of roasting. Compared to a bag of Starbucks coffee, yes, RAW is still a bit more pricey, but not by much.  
Since introducing my colleagues to RAW, they too have become subconsciously fussy about coffee!  
As much as I sound like I work for RAW, I can assure you, I don't. </TEXT>

Their delivery guy is always friendly, always has change, always comes on time. I'm a self proclaimed coffee snob, and their coffee is top notch on an international scale.

I'd rather employ someone at 20k who was on 15k. They'll be happier, work harder, and stay longer. Of course I'm generalising, but when employing, you need to reduce risk of someone leaving.

You also didn't tell me NOT to look at you, and there are an infinite number of things I'm doing right now that you didn't ask me to do; a lot of which you'd probably be annoyed if I didn't do, like breathing, or standing on two legs, rather than one. So you using an argument like 'did I ask you to do that?' Is quite frankly a load of balderdash.

 = b  
A dash above the letter means it is followed by an a sound:  
 = ba  
A dash below the letter means it is followed by an e sound:  
 = be  
And a little open apostrophe like thing means it's an oo sound
 = bo 
The "open" dot over the  is a bit like a circle and as someone else pointed out this means that the syllable stops there. Like "club".  
In the same way that you can read English if the letters are rearranged or vowels stripped out, Arab speakers can still read with out the diacritics (the accents, or lines). However, sometimes it can lead to a subtle difference.

Not knocking the car, but it's not great off road, and not great on road. It tries to be both and doesn't do well in either. Try and decide if you want to go onto dunes or not. If you do, get a real 4x4. If not, you can get a better hatchback for the same money. I've got a fair bit of experience on and off road (including track) and always look to get best bang for buck on a car (rather than waste money on something useless).

<TEXT> He said he remembers "this morning". The phrase "this morning" can be used to either refer to:  
A) a specific morning that he was talking about or  
B) the morning of today  
The example in "A" usually requires that the writer previously mentioned the context/time. E.g. "It was the day we met... I remember this morning..."  
so without context, it usually means "today's morning" so he was actually saying that he remembers today, like it was yesterday.  
Also to "remember X like it was yesterday" is used to describe an event long ago but remembered so clearly hat it could have only been yesterday.  
So if OP remembers today, like it was yesterday, he's actually forgetting it very quickly! :)  
It was subtle, and he's not incorrect, I was just picking up on it to make it funny :)

<TEXT> As a westerner myself, I too would probably choose another westerner because of cultural compatibility. However, some of my best friends come from other background and would happily live with them. What upset me was the advertisement of the preference. It kind of puts off non westerners straight away, even if they would have been a fantastic candidate. If you didn't implicitly eliminate all non westerners, that doesn't mean you couldn't still opt for a westerner which you ended up preferring. It's the sweeing generalisation which wasn't needed.

<TEXT> Experienced biker here (in several countries). I hate riding motorcycles in Dubai. The only place one can enjoy them in this country is in the mountains after fajr, and in the desert.  
As soon as there is anyone else on the roads, it takes all the fun out of the twisty mountain roads. Inside the city, the roads are just long and straight, which are the most tedious on a motorcycle. (especially something like a Ninja). Plus there are cameras every 20 metres!  
Also, is this your first bike? Would not recommend a 600 Ninja for a first bike.  
Sorry if this sounds negative, I do honestly love riding! </TEXT>

You're talking to a guy who in the UK buys from Alchemy, Square Mile and Has Bean, whoch are roasted the day before shipping. I even have my favourite plantation (In Yirgacheffe, Etheopia). I have a pressure gauge portafilter for my Gaggia to calibrate it. I adjust my grind depending on how many days old the roast is. I do not buy coffee from a supermarket (such as Illy). So if I'm clueless, it's certainly not of decent coffee, but only of the price of old, stale supermarket coffee.

Business if definitely a much bigger jump than Economy to Premium Economy. Get beds for starters, a la carte menu etc, priority bags, lounge, fast track blah blah... Totally not worth the money. Would never pay that myself, but if my company does, I won't complain. </TEXT>

If they are obviously another westerner, fine to shake hands, but if you are dealing will locals, it's more polite to not offer your hand. If you do, they may or may not shake hands which could be awkward if they don't, and if they do, they will most likely be feeling very uncomfortable with it.

<TEXT> It totally depends what kind of things you like. Personally I would forget about dubai after you've seen the sparkly lights on the burj Khalifa. Having travelled to many many countries, of all the places I would recommend visiting, Dubai would be near the bottom of the list. (And actually, I love Flanders). So I'm probably the last person you should seek advice from! :)  
That said, if I could recommend anything, I would say to drive out of the city and see the desert. Forget the desert safaris. It's a bunch of tacky fake touristy crap! Do you like camping? I just take my 4x4 out on the weekends.  
Yas Marina would be good if there's something on (like last week!). If you like fancy cars, check out "city walk" on a Thursday evening.  
Check out Box Park too.

<TEXT> Driving here isn't bad. Just don't expenct anyone to be considerate. Renting a car is best option in my opinion.  
Forget shopping in the malls; Europe is way cheaper.  
As for locals, you are unlikely to ever interact with them. They only make up less than 15% of the population. If you want a more authentic middle eastern experience, forget Dubai, it doesn't exist here. Try Oman (which I would HIGHLY recommend over Dubai) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really? So you mean to say that every single rape claim is genuine? I'm trying to belittle the crime, God knows it's horrific.  
However, you have also shown your tyre colours. A westerner is imprisoned in the Middle East, media cries foul, and somehow everyone instantly knows all the intricacies of the case. Have you seen evidence either way? Could it be possible that she wasn't actually raped and she's trying to destroy someone's life? My point was, we get our news through unreliable media outlets, which can hardly constitute a fair trial. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Yeah, for capital punishment. but that's not a pre-requisite for ANY trial or punishment. 
  
  
 It is for rape too, which is the subject of this article.

I meant that the requirement for 4 witnesses was only to request the capital punishment but the the 4 weren't required for a lesser sentence ("ANY trial or punishment") of rape. One could still be punished without the witnesses, just not to the extent of capital punishment.  
I take your point about the clubbing environments though (a side of Dubai I don't really see myself :p )  
I spent about 6 months working in Tokyo, and I was thinking of that when I typed my message as yeah, I totally agree, and I would move there in a heartbeat if my Japanese was anywhere near my Arabic! However, no matter how safe it felt, there seemed to have a certain subtle underlying sinister feel to certain places. It's hard to describe, or put my finger on. Maybe I read too much about the Yakuza, haha or been watching too many Japanese movies! ;)  
I think the difference between the two places if that the Japanese are so unbelievably conscientious, dedicated an honourable. That last term "honour" can turn violent, and when coupled with determination, can get ugly. Whereas Arabs (of the Gulf) pretty much can't be arsed to do anything, let alone get up to be violent. It's more a safety out of apathy in Dubai :p </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nice reply.  
However, on the last point, what Muslims are taught, and what they practice are totally different. Just look at the way they drive putting the lives of others at risk, the way they litter and ruin the environment, the way they inconsiderately push in line. I am a revert, I see all this first hand around the world. Try going on Hajj, you'll see the best and a lot more of the worst of people's behaviour.  
I have had some very very pleasant interactions and received some great hospitality from Arabs, however, never from an Emirati. The perception is that they they act holier than thou, and look down on others. I would love to be shown another side. </TEXT>

If parking in a handicapped space isn't a big issue (i.e. low fine) then why is it a massive issue if it's shared? I agree that it's definitely an issue, but 150 times worse? If the act of sharing was so bad as to have caused serious distress to the original guy, then this is rather telling of public perception of the gravity of the initial contravention, when in fact wasn't that big a deal. </TEXT>

I'm a white Brit, I wear the kandoora to the masjid (a revert), and occasionally around town. However, I have seen other English guys wearing them but they look like ignorant idiot tourists who were probably ripped off for one which doesn't even fit properly. I always thought I looked smart u til I saw those guys... now I feel like people look at me as some foreign idiot who's taking the piss.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work in broadcasting, and there is totally no reason they need to cut out the race. One of the products that we design will allow you to play out a show, and stretch/squash the time plane (by roughly 20%) with phase shifting so the audio sounds correct. This allows broadcasters to slip in ads and still keep the format. Yes, it'll be SLIGHTLY non live, but is that such an issue? If it is, then why not use our *holds up product B* which allows you to put a PIP and have the advert there? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's also because all the workforce here is imported. To import, you need to offer something more attractive than where they were before. Companies pay as little as they need to retain a person. If this person has a good opportunity elsewhere, you need to pay them more.

Those whose commit acts of terrorism generally come from either broken families, or from backgrounds with some socio-economic issue. They are generally angry youths, often uneducated and more exposed to western entertainment glamorising violence (movies/games) than they are from a pious, spiritual background.

<TEXT> But ice melting doesn't raise sea levels...  
If you have a block of ice in water, it sticks out the top, that's because it's less dense than water. This includes the bit above and below the water level. As it melts, the density equalises above AND below the water, so the frozen stuff below the water level now has less volume, and thus the level is maintained.

<TEXT> I totally agree with you here. Whilst I concede that I may be an idealist, you must admit that should people (all over the world) cease to enlist themselves in armed forces, then we can snatch back a massive amount of leverage over these "powers in control".  
The world is in such a mess that it's a case of "you drop your gun first". But if we, the common people, stop fighting all together, then the corrupt will be powerless.  
There is not a force in the world that genuinely defends freedom against tyranny. Because the tyranny is always the other guy.

The idea of an enemy is often manufactured.  
In the world wars there were many reports of "enemy" fighters sharing times of leisure; famously the Christmas day football game. The "enemy" is just like you. If you put yourself in the "enemy's" shoes, you will most likely have done exactly the same as them and most would rather not be fighting (leaving only the 4th category). </TEXT>

If they sign up outside conscription, then it's hard to be sympathetic. I know it sounds harsh, and they probably have a really shitty time dealing with it and can't imagine how I'd deal with it. But surely one knows that it's horrific when you sign up, right? You are effectively volunteering to take the lives of others. I know I'll get downvoted to hell, but this world needs fewer fighters killing people. It's terrible that even those that survive combat, come home and take their own lives. Something's really wrong worth the world. </TEXT>
