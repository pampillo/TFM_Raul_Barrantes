<TITLE> Mother's Day. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-08 21:41:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I dreamed about my mom a lot after she died. It doesn't make any rational sense - nothing about the way she died was my fault - but I think I felt guilty about it. Losing her had been my biggest fear, and then it just happened out of nowhere. It began and ended with a call from my oldest brother in the middle of the night, and a mumbled "Mom's not here anymore," and then I spent the next five hours howling into my pillow waiting for the sun to rise. 

I was twenty six. I wasn't ready to be an orphan. (Can you call yourself an orphan at 26? Does 'orphan' still apply to legal adults?)

Anyway, she was three weeks from retiring, and her health hadn't been great, but it hadn't been alarming, either. That didn't stop the dreams from dogging me. They started off pretty standard from what I've read up on a bunch of grief support forums: sometimes I would just see her, hang out with her a while. Once I dreamed that I walked in on her smoking on the back porch hooked to the house we had when I was growing up. She'd faked her death in that dream, and got really mad at me for "discovering" her and ruining her retirement.

The dreams kind of started going off the rails after that. Probably because I started sleeping more. My friends just assumed I was depressed, and that was probably part of it, but dreams were the only place that I could see her anymore. I mean, yeah. It hurt. It was like driving a thumb into a bruise. But I didn't have a lot of choice. I started to dream about finding her lost and wandering in the woods. I found her once drowned in a river like Ophelia, eyes wide open and milky white. Sometimes I dreamed that I had fallen into the past, and had called her up just to beg her to go to the hospital, to get her headache checked out. I love you, I love you, I love you, I repeated every time, just in case she wasn't sure, just because I knew I couldn't stop her from dying, and I was terrified that she would pass and somehow not know how much she meant to me. 

I can't remember her voice when I'm awake. I can't remember what she looks like, either, unless I've got a photo to jump start the memories. But my recollection is perfect in my dreams. I spent a whole day with her once, just in my dreams, and I can remember the hug I gave her when I was saying goodbye, when I remembered that she was dead. We were the same height, but I can remember how fragile and delicate her arms felt when I pulled her against me. I can remember how her hair smelled. I told her goodbye, and I was crying, and she was crying, and she told me goodbye, too.

I remember that more vividly than any real hug I ever gave her.

I thought at first maybe that I'd finally found closure. That maybe this was enough, and that I could move on, but it wasn't, and I didn't, and the dreams didn't stop. Haven't stopped. She hides from me now, but my dreams are mine. Last night I found myself standing at her grave, and I ripped away the headstone and the dirt and the coffin lid with my hands. It shredded like cotton candy. She cowered when I found her, wraithlike and delicate, and I hugged her again. I love you, I love you, I love you, please don't forget that, I begged her, and she begged me to let her go. We cried together until I woke up. 

But I'm only twenty eight. I'm not ready to be an orphan. Not yet.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> just as a general note to folks going "UGH WHY DIDNT SHE JUST BLOCK HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE"

she didn't because 

* 1) they had a mutual friend, 

* 2) he messaged her with the pretense of honest intentions (questions about a university she had previously attended), and 

* 3) she is a good person who understands that folks sometimes have difficulty communicating with other people. she was willing to give him a shot and say "hey, those remarks aren't appropriate, please stop," because she is a teacher and a damn good one, and trying to course correcting idiots is kind of a reflex when you deal with college students all day.



sometimes it's easier to be nice than to have to worry about some dude flipping out and tagging your friends on his wall to call you an egotistical cunt for blocking him "for just saying hi." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey! I'm looking for folks who are interested in playing through some of Grant Howitt's one-shots (like [Honey Heist](http://i.imgur.com/rAZXBWb.jpg) and [Big Gay Orcs](https://i.imgur.com/n7D0tdl.jpg).) I'd to include some outgoing folks who aren't afraid to get into the zany kind of RP that these little systems seem to facilitate. 

Please send me a PM if you're interested with a little bit of information about yourself. Plans would likely involve meeting online around 6PM CST on Saturday. Each 'game' would likely last a session or two. Depending on interest/how much fun the players are having, I'd be happy to either keep the same group or rotate new people in and out when we swap games. </TEXT>
