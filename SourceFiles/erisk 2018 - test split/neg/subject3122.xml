<TEXT> I don't understand why we have to get abusive police officers on video before this type of action is taken. It seems like the officers (the few bad apples) most likely to engage in this type of severe bad behavior already have some history of complaints and aggressiveness. Why isn't that viewed as a red flag that leads to greater scrutiny and monitoring of the officer? That's how it would work with any other employee...smoke would at least lead to a suspicion of fire. 

Citizen journalism shouldn't be the only way to keep the police honest! </TEXT>

In any other conceivable case where you'd be making a move up (e.g. Contingent faculty to full time, clinical faculty to tenure track, post-doc to faculty member), you should expect and get the full support of your current department to go and take the interview.

One or two of those conversations is usually enough to reassure me or, by contrast, to help me conclude what I've done wrong and plan for better future responses.

The read I get from your post is that you did the best you could under the circumstances. Your response sounds firm but fair. I bet further information about things they said would get you some combination of sympathy and "toppers."  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's important to give the author credit where it's due. The author appears to have done an acceptable job of accounting for the sorts of health policy and socioeconomic factors you'd expect to be alternative explanations for the observed correlation. While I'd like the author to better explain their regression methodology to provide greater confidence in their results (they say time-series but don't explain which type of time series adjustments they make), they have done a strong job of developing the general model framework. Using leads and lags in their analysis establishes support for temporal precedence, one of the conditions required to support causation. More importantly, the paper includes several sensitivity/robustness checks which lend support to the result being more than just correlation. 

I'm not saying that paper provides 100% assurance that the relationship is causal. Writing off the results as being mere correlation, however, inappropriately (IMHO) discounts the robustness of the results.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That would require someone to go belt to belt with him. That isn't a great strategy for the smaller rikishi given how large he is and how much leverage it would take to just topple him over. He would also take the risk that a smaller, more nimble rikishi would simply sidestep his attempt to fall on them because of their relative spryness. When people go belt to belt with Orora, you usually see him simply use his physical bulk  to push them toward the bales and out of the ring. 

Here are some examples of his losses. Notice that they seem to focus on working him off balance, a considerable issue for larger sumo (smallish legs plus a big top makes for a shaky foundation).

I clearly did not see him put the returns in the reporter's box, nor did I hear him order anyone else to do so. I rely upon his well-documented pattern of behavior with respect to leaking things, his quick response to the leak (as opposed to his generally ignoring such things), the fact that 2005 was a unique year for him (Melania going up for citizenship and all), and the timing of the release in the middle of a bad news cycle related to health care. Of course, this evidence is circumstantial and will not convince you. I find it compelling, however, and will continue to do so.

<TEXT> This is an unpopular thing to say, but I think it needs to be said. Questions about the integrity of scientists in China (in particular, rather than just Asia more generally) spill over to evaluation of the graduate candidates they train. The resume embellishment issues are not limited to Asian candidates, but that will also lead to greater scrutiny for your package. 

Do you have any sense of the quality (i.e. ranking, editorial board composition, etc.) of the journals where you've published those papers OP? Can you provide clear evidence of your experience with engineering (i.e. Patents, highlighting specific project contributions, etc.)?

I second what has been said about aiming your sights lower in terms of graduate program ranking. Your GPA is too low to be considered as a viable candidate by many programs. Try expanding your pool of school, perform well while there, and then perhaps consider using that as a springboard to a better school for further graduate study. It's an expensive plan, but it might be the most viable given your circumstance. 

Edited: Added suggestions and deleted "academic" from "academic integrity." </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off, thank you for responding...I'm so glad that I didn't come off as some judgmental jerk and prompt you to ignore the comment. I know where you're coming from because I experience it with my partner's family. They are a similar flavor of weird to what you describe. I also get what you're saying about feeling like you're the outcast (paraphrasing). It's natural that you'd feel that way under the circumstances. 

For what it's worth, It helped my state of mind when I decided to limit myself to a single rejoinder every time something weird came up. It left me feeling like I let it be known that I saw the manipulation for what it is but left too little in terms of material for them to escalate the situation. We aren't friends, but the reduced tension has left things markedly more civil (that was my goal). I hope you all can find a way to meet your goals in this situation. Congratulations also on the baby! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you considered that your parents might have a point? Everyone here seems to agree that your MIL is overbearing and that your husband, while well intentioned, isn't doing enough to keep that at bay. There is little in your post, however, that suggests you're trying to help build a better relationship. To the reader, it's her being intrusive and you being sort of snide in response. Your reaction to her birth control query seemed  inexplicably aggressive to me, frankly. You could have just said "I don't really want to talk about that sort of thing...that's so awkward."

I point this out in an effort to prompt some reflection on your part. What's your goal in this? If it's to have a close relationship with MIL, you're probably not going about that well. I don't think that's what you want, though, because it seems clear you don't like her (I suspect the feeling is mutual). Start from your goal and that will help you and your husband manage things more effectively.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't usually condone this sort of Frank talk with supervisors, but I think it's warranted here. You need to have a way to Jeremy from screwing with your personal and professional life. Given that the two of you seem to have a close relationship, I'd simply tell him these things. You like Matthew already and the talk with Jeremy gets in the way of that. Given that Jeremy wants the best for his son (as evidenced by his manipulations), he'll back off once you make this plain. Once that's settled, the work stuff will...well, work out. 

If it doesn't immediately get better, of course, then see HR. You should be keeping notes on what Jeremy has done...particularly the quid-pro-quo related to your promotion. That's a big legal no-no and could really cause them trouble. Keep the notes but don't use them immediately.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Two things:

You will be able to identify a company that has been forced to restate their financial statements by reviewing SEC Enforcement actions. Each action tells you why the company he been forced to restate. There are a lot of companies that end up restating for various reasons but those that are forced to restate by the SEC will specifically identify the misstatements as intentional and/or fraudulent. 

You need to have a definition of fraud in order to decide which companies you are going to look at. The papers you are referring to run the gamut from viewing every misstatement as fraud to only the most intentional material misstatements being fraud. If you read the sample selection portion of the paper closely you can figure out the definition they are using and go from there.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm interested in what you think of the specific claim that the defendant lacks expertise as a film critic. Is there some precedent that establishes expertise as a precondition to engage in critical fair use under the Fair Use doctrine? 

I also feel like the argument that the defendant engaged in willful infringement due to his familiarity with Fair Use doctrine as a non-lawyer somehow undermines his expertise argument. If defendant isn't expert enough to conduct film criticism without film training, how can he have sufficient expertise to have engaged in willful infringement without legal training? </TEXT>

After reading his lie-filled defense, it seems obvious that he isn't deserving of our empathy. Either he's lying about being a victim of child-rape to vilify other gay men (if you believe his defense), or he's lying about not being a victim in order to minimize the experiences of other child-rape victims. Either way, this denial makes it very difficult for me to empathize with Milo.  </TEXT>

He did so while alienating huge swaths of non-white voters, building an overwhelmingly White coalition.  He did so while alienating our allies. 

All this means our President does not need to care about (1) the mainstream press and what they think, (2) non-White Americans, or (3) foreign powers who don't immediately come bowing and scraping to preserve their relationship with the US. He doesn't care what you think because you didn't vote for him anyway. When his jack-booted thugs come for you, the people who voted for him will cheer because they will have won against their opponents. 

The President acts this way because he has no choice. This is his only move.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was looking at the March 1931 Banzuke on the SumoDB site and noticed an unfamiliar notation related to some of the Ozeki listed there. Instead of being listed as "O,", they are listed as "HD." When I dig into their individual profiles, the expanded ranking is listed as "O2wHD." When I looked at other Banzuke from around the same time, you can find similar notation for Komusibi (K2wHD) and Sekiwake (S2eHD).

Can anyone tell me what the HD stands for and why it doesn't seem to be used anymore? Thanks, in advance, for any information you can offer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You've identified a very credible explanation for the situation you find yourself in. If you were at my institution, you'd have been assisted with finding another supervisor under the circumstances. That isn't something you get to decide unilaterally, however. Some administrator or senior person may be able to facilitate additional supervision, but I get why you may be reluctant to seek that. 

With respect to your passing, I think that attitude is dangerous to your future prospects. The point of the education is to learn. It's the school's job to provide you with support for that learning. If they've taught you and you haven't learned, that's one thing. If they aren't teaching you or providing appropriate supervision, that's quite another. Only you know which end of that spectrum your situation falls into. The thesis is only valuable in that it helps you apply the concepts and learning the program has provided you. Do it the right way even if you can get away with doing it half-assed.

Once you say the words, the thinking goes among abuse victims, the truth of what happened to you will be out there. By getting all of what you said out into the world via Reddit, however, you've already overcome the hardest part of the healing process. There are now people who know what happened, even if they don't know you personally. You've said the words. 

Build on that brave first step and find someone to tell this to who can help you. Someone you can trust. A counselor, a teacher, a pastor or priest...just make it someone you trust. Or call the numbers that others will provide you and say the words out loud to someone who can't see you. It gets easier to talk about it and confront things each time you do it.

<TITLE> Comparing Coefficients Across Independent Samples Using Separate Regression Estimations </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-11 03:23:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am reading a paper where the authors are attempting to draw inferences about separate subgroups of a population. These populations are expected to behave differently with respect to the dependent variable, but the models are constructed using the same predictors. The authors separately (not simultaneously) estimate the two models. They then use a Wald test to test the equality of coefficients across models (i.e. comparing beta1 in model 1 to beta1 in model 2).

Is this the right way to do things? I thought it was more appropriate to use a series of Seemingly Unrelated Equations in order to jointly estimate the coefficients. I've done some searching and have only been able to come up with answers for when it's one model and multiple subgroups or multiple models with different predictors, not multiple models with the same predictors but different populations.

Thanks for any insight you can offer! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel for this Adrian fellow. There are some food smells that just turn individual stomachs. For me, it's the spices in Indian food. I literally will eat any other food, even spicy food, but the smell of most Indian dishes (particularly curries) makes me want to jump out a window. What a "meat" smell is I don't know, but it's certainly possible he's really bothered by it. 

Still, it's up to him to be socially sensitive here. I bet off when my friends go to an Indian restaurant. When they bring it to the office, I do my best to tolerate it in silence. If it were an everyday thing, I might discuss it with them directly. What you don't do, however, is blindside people at a meeting and use the manager as a buffer to get your way. He's going to have to grovel to get back into the in crowd.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> People respond to rewards much more favorable than penalties. Thus, I'm always careful to frame things as rewards in the classroom. For example, I make tests err toward being too difficult in order to leave room to give back points as a curve. Similarly, I make deadlines which err toward being too tight. That way, I can give them extra time. I end up at the same place in terms of grade distribution, but I have the benefit of students viewing me as generous in spirit. This shows up as comments in my reviews, saying that I'm fair and understanding.  </TEXT>

The reason we depreciate assets is to match the expense of our use of the asset (i.e. the reduction in value associated with our use) with the period when we derive the benefit of the expense (i.e. the period when we get revenue by using the truck in operations). That we get smoother earnings is an important benefit, but it doesn't represent the theoretical purpose of depreciation.  </TEXT>

The trouble seemed to be, in addition to the concerns you mention about hinkaku, that his losses in that 12-3 tournament were to lower ranked wrestlers early on the tournament (one Yokozuna was absent while the other dropped out mid-way).

<TEXT> I agree with many people here in thinking I didn't hold professors in such high regard. A few professors stand out as being especially brilliant. Most professors, however, simply don't have a chance to demonstrate their expertise given that they teach mostly required courses which aren't their specialty. For example, you could have a French Revolution scholar teaching European history or Western Civ. That professor gets one day out of the term to show off. It's not enough to make an impression most of the time.

<TEXT> The first one wasn't memorable in any way. I suspect that means it was an elderly person in my home parish with whom I was unacquainted. A funeral for a very old person is a much milder affair than, say, one for a child or even middle aged person. There's generally little surprise, so the family tends to be relatively calm.  These funerals take on a much more celebratory feel with family and friends coming to pay their respects rather than mourn deeply. None of this is to say that people aren't sad...they are. They just aren't as overwhelmed by their sadness. That makes it easier to witness and, consequently, easier to sing. 

More simply put, a person's age matters. Someone dying at 65 these days can be described as tragic. At 85, it's "their time." At 105, it's "they cheated death out of 20 years!" </TEXT>

<TEXT> More like 12 hours max for funerals if you factor travel time, but yes...that's about right. Of course, you're doing what most people do by ignoring the inputs to the work. I practiced regularly to stay sharp, went to university for four years to study my craft, and took years of expensive voice and piano lessons before and after university to build up basic musical skills. I also worked hard to network and maintain relationships in order to have access to work. Additionally, I have the sort of demeanor that you would expect from someone who works in the service industry rather than a more "artistic temperament." I also engaged in other musical work, like holding a regular church musician job and teaching student to supplement that income. 

Basically, this isn't a job that just anyone can do, let alone do well. Frankly, it isn't even a job that most musicians can do. People won't tolerate a bad funeral musician for long, so there is constant pressure to be on top of your craft. The money is a reflection of the circumstances of the job and the low supply of competent, temperamentally suitable people.  </TEXT>

What matters is that you have a solid voice, good reading skills, and that you're reliable. It's doubly good if you can play piano and/or organ. Once you are known to have those things, networking and announcement of intent are the missing links.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I kind of fell into the job, actually. I am Catholic and active within the church, so I was known to priests. I also know Catholic rituals well, an important consideration given the volume of service music involved. I was also known to local musicians as someone who can sight read music well. Most importantly, I can sing and play at the same time. Sometimes I did one or the other, but other times I did both. It was a convergence of skills that made me qualified for the job. 

As for how I did it, I feel like my other comments can give a more complete impression of how I did it than any response I could write here.  </TEXT>

I truly believe that I haven't been scammed because people don't want to sully the memory of their loved ones with such behavior.

It didn't even occur to me to point that part of the funeral service out, but yeah...that's screwed up that we put kids in that position so young. 

I want to say I didn't chuckle at the dramatized version of your story in my head, but I can't. It's clearly tragic for the family, but also something directly from a Cohen Brothers film. You either laugh about it or cry about it...I almost always choose laughter! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The one with the wailing (or keening, as someone told me it's called), threw me for a loop. I sang the closing hymn kind of choked up. On a relative basis, I find deceased mothers harder to sing for since I get song so well with mine and hate thinking she will pass away someday. Very poorly attended funerals also bother me more than the huge ones because I feel sorry for the deceased. It got harder as I got older and more aware of my own mortality. Most funerals aren't of the cosmic tragic variety, however. Seeing how much people live their 80-year-old grampy is more sweet than bothersome. 

I actually find weddings to be harder to do on average, personally. Seeing so much happiness stirs up a lot of emotion. I've rarely gotten through a wedding without a few tears. I don't have coping mechanisms for that like I do for funerals.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our ideas of crazy may diverge a bit, but the craziest one I recall was somebody asking me to sing "Proud Mary" because they thought it was a good encapsulation of the deceased person's life.   There were other contemporary tunes, but at least those made some sense in context. But "Proud Mary?" Nope!

Honestly, requests don't get very crazy simply because of the timing of the choice. People are generally grief stricken, so you generally get either music planned by the deceased, a fond memory of a single hymn, or a family that leaves the music up to you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've never been scammed, per se, but I have been in situations where families try to get around payment by bringing in their own musicians. They can have whoever they'd like play or sing, but most churches provide their musicians with bench fees (or at least the organist). Thus, they were still obliged to pay me for the service whether I played/sang or not. I have mixed feelings on the ethics of that position, but that's the only place where I've ever had payment drama from families. Even then, most don't fight it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No horror stories regarding money, no. There have been times when something happened with the check, but those were oversights rather than grievances. Collection was more of a problem for weddings, however, because of the timing of things and the lack of a coordinator at the church in most cases. In general, payment was smooth because the churches set expectations ahead of time regarding payment. Funerals generally have the director there to manage money matters.

<TEXT> Stories that Redditors wouldn't believe? I'm sure you've got plenty. 

Stories that I personally wouldn't believe? I highly doubt that. As with your friend, I've been a part of some very unusual moments throughout my career as a church musician. It's a relief to not be part of that scene anymore...seeing how the proverbial sausage gets made has taken its toll on my spiritual life. 

I won't share the worst ones as those are difficult to recount. A weird service I did, however, was a memorial service (non-religious) for a well-known local businessman. They rented out a large hall for people to come and celebrate his life. Cut to the eulogies and five of his family members gently talking about what a difficult man he was and how they weren't exactly glad he was dead, but how they understood if people had mixed feelings about the event. 

Singing "Danny Boy" after that fiasco was a pip, let me tell you. Awkward turtle! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah...you could fit in well among us. While we would never make a joke like that in the Church, sometimes inappropriate jokes are the way you get through it all. I had a singer whose used to arrive and ask "who's today's contestant?" They were a joy to work with, as you can imagine. 

Still, Sour Ball Girl was a hard one even with that sort of cavalier attitude toward the proceedings. The family were completely shell shocked...no tears, nothing. Just mute people with blank, stunned faces. Plus, the casket was open when I arrived. No amount of makeup can fix the effects of asphyxiation, let's just leave it at that. 

Sometimes, you just get through it by knowing you are helping these people through a difficult time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You need to have a certain kind of personality for it, I think. It's easier for us than for funeral directors or priests because we just come in at the end. The hardest part is dealing with the family and their raw emotions. If you approach it from a place of sympathy rather than empathy, it goes better. I've definitely had days, however, where I've carried some of those emotions into the rest of my day. Funerals as in the morning so there is a whole day left to ruminate if you let that happen. By and large, however, you just...get used to it? I chose to focus on the technical aspects of the music to help focus my attention away from the body and the grief of the family. It mostly worked.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can do a search for most popular Catholic funeral hymns and you'll get a variety of lists. The most common hymns include:

On Eagle's Wings
Amazing Grace
How Great Thou Art
Blest Are They
Be Not Afraid
Here I Am, Lord
Prayer of St. Francis
You Are Mine 
I Know That My Redeemer Lives
Christ Be Our Light
Lord of All Hopefulness
We Have Been Told
Eye Has Not Seen
I Am the Bread of Life

Most funerals I sang included at least one from that list. Most of those hymns have some reference to resurrection and/or salvation. People seem to find those thoughts comforting. 

Additionally, you need a psalm setting. Most people; in my experience, chose either Psalm 23 (The Lord is My Shepherd), 27 (The Lord is my Light), or 103 (The Lord is Kind and Merciful). There is also a mass setting containing sung parts of the mass that must be chosen. Most parishes have a standard setting, so you need to know several offhand in order to avoid surprises (I know 7). 

Lastly, you need a meditation and song of farewell. These tend to be where you get the most variety. In my experience, you find some ethnic preferences among these as well as some standards. Schubert's "Ave Maria" is so popular it's basically a running joke among Catholic funeral singers. I've sung it literally hundreds of times and could sing it on command from memory with no warm-up or warning provided you let me pick the key. Panis Angelicus is another meditation I sang often. Ethnic preferences mostly included traditional hymns or parish-specific favorites. For example, Irish-dominated parishes will tend to have lots of requests for a religious setting of the tune to Danny Boy or another traditional hymn called "St. Patrick's Breastplate". French-Canadians often want to hear "J'irai La Voir Un Jour" or another traditional French hymn. Similar preferences exist for other ethnic groups as well. You might also have a hymn to celebrate a particular family member passing, such as "Mother, At Her Feet Are Kneeling" or a Marian hymn for a deceased mother. 

Most important, however, is checking with the funeral director regarding the gender of the deceased so you use the right pronouns for the hymn. I wish I could say that had never gone wrong before. 

Keep in mind that I'm talking most common here. I've had many funerals that included only hymns from that list and the Ave Maria. I've also had eclectic funeral requests with none of the content listed here.

<TEXT> I was a funeral musician for quite a long time. 4-6 funerals a week, mainly Catholic services. I made approximately $40k a year just in funeral service fees. Most people I know think I'm joking when I tell them I did that as a job. 

Basically, I show up at funerals and play and/or sing religious service music. I could do it almost without thinking since there are really only 20-25 songs/hymns that people want to hear at a funeral. You show them a list of suggestions and they get their service music, easy peasy. The tomes where you got an odd request were exciting by comparison. Show up 15 minutes before, leave 10 minutes after, collect your check on the way out. 

It sounds pretty heartless the way I describe it. Perhaps it is a bit. That sort of mindset is needed, however, to have any shot at being able to do the job. We all developed a bit of gallows humor just to cope with the sadness of comforting mourners on a daily basis. However, you cant really know what it's like to do that job until you are actually doing it. I've sung at a funeral for 4 dead kids and their mother who died trying to protect them in a freak house fire. I showed up to sing one time for the funeral of a 20-year old who choked to death on a sour ball. The casket was still open...some regions of the country have open-casket calling hours in the church just before the service. Another time, I sang at the funeral of a woman who had just given birth to her 2nd child. Her family members were wailing and throwing themselves at the casket. If you think you know what I mean by wailing, you probably don't know...it's a unique, haunting sound that creeps into my mind at low moments. 

I call it the best worst job I'll ever have.

<TEXT> I reject your characterization of my comment. On the one hand, you have students of color presenting an argument about a group of people they view as having systematically oppressed their people for centuries. In the other hand, you have you, a person who is upset (or feigning upset) at the confrontational argumentation style these student have chosen. The aggrieved feelings of the first group deserve far greater consideration of the second. I reject your attempt to goad me with a false equivalence through the use of your counter example. The merits of style are debatable and of lesser importance to the merits of pointing out systematic oppression are not. 

As for your edited addition, you are misrepresenting your previous comment. Calling something "disgusting" and "racist, divisive nonsense" implies a certain amount of disagreement with those points. We are in agreement that they are divisive...it's not clear to me that they are all racist, although they probably they are. 

Lastly, you should expect that your statements will be held to a higher standard here than in some other subreddits. I simply assumed you were an academic since I wouldn't expect you to visit this area if you weren't. Your attempt at provocation was therefore treated just as I would treat one of these students' attempts: dispassionately and thoughtfully.

<TEXT> I don't know how you can judge a presentation on the title. Titles are intended to be eye-catching and, in some instances, provocative. All of these slides certainly accomplish those goals, even those which aren't strictly title slides. Just because you don't agree with the theses (I'm guessing based on your butt-hurt response here) doesn't make them not worth considering or explication. Of course, the support for these these needs to be just as rigorously scrutinized as any other support for any other theses. Aren't we for academic freedom here, however?

Who would even trust the loan officer if they went and verified the information themselves...they have financial incentives to lie, meaning they might want the password to print up information that is overly positive toward the borrower (e.g. Deposits only, excluding certain transactions, etc.).

<TEXT> In her defense, she isn't soliciting some random person. This is the father of her child and someone she has a history with. Granted, that doesn't make it alright to be seeking out other relationships while living with a BF. I wouldn't go suggesting she's a pattern cheater, however, given the circumstances. 

As far as the rest of it goes, I think you make a good point. Money and stability can be a very attractive thing for someone in an unstable place in their own life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only issue I can see with this channel is that the videos and commentary are from NHK World. If you download their app, you can see a schedule that will tell you when they'll be streaming their Grand Sumo Highlights. Because it's someone else's production, I can see a situation where this channel gets shut down at some point in the future. Kintamayama, by contrast, pieces together his videos and provides his own commentary...much more of a "fair use" than simply grabbing the NHK production.

Clearly the OP should avoid being needlessly cruel. But I don't see why OP shouldn't seek the comfort of family if that's what is needed. OP is the victim here, not the mother. It's up to the mother to deal with any revelation of her awful actions as she sees fit. Don't put it on the OP to also manage the mother and gee feelings. 

With that said, I agree OP would benefit from a therapist to talk this all over with.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Over in YouTube land, Kintamayama basically suggested that Tochinoshin intentionally lost his match to Gagamaru in order to help Gagamaru ensure his kachi koshi. A number of the commenters on the video seemed to agree. I also noticed that the NHK highlights program didn't include that fight in their footage for the day. It certainly looked like Tochinoshin got beaten handily, but he seemed to look that way in some of his other matches. Of course, those other matches were with higher ranked opponents...

Is there some sort of open secret regarding match throwing I don't know about because I'm a relatively new follower of the sport? It seems like throwing a match would be very costly, what with the use of tournament records to seed the following tournaments. I know there were some issues with match fixing in the not-so-distant past, but that doesn't seem to be what's being suggested here (or is or)? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Write that letter, OP, or visit the department chair in person. It absolutely will help other students. I can confirm that professors have conversations like this, both formally and informally. A recent faculty meeting in my department saw us talking about discrepancies like you saw here, leading us to agree that all professors who teach the same course would meet and agree on a shared median grade to be enforced by the department. It's true that we can't force each other to grade a specific way without their consent (it's an issue of academic freedom). However, not all professors are even thinking about the real world implications of their grading. Once made aware of it, people have ways of getting very pragmatic. We mostly know where our bread is buttered and want the best for our students. You can't pass people who should fail, you shouldn't turn a C into an A, but you can and should squeak out a B- from a C+ if it'll keep a Big 4 placement. 

I'm curious...did the OP try asking their professor for the B-? I know some professors will ignore the plea, but they might also have been amenable to negotiation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> How about unionizing? If your university tolerates outright bullying, students have a clear incentive to seek protection through unionization. My university recently considered a union drive. One of the anti-union positions was that the University already had an excellent track record of treating graduate students well in their capacity as workers. However you feel about that argument, it's clear that your university is not that way. 

Alternatively, you can speak to an administrator outside the department. A Dean, for example, is in a good position to deal with this issue. 

Keep in mind, however, that all of these potential actions are risky. Academic hazing is a systemic issue. Many of us went through it to some degree, and we all know it goes on. Making waves could get you branded a troublemaker. This could limit job options, lab transfer options, etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a disconnect between what the responses have been here and your apparent understanding of those responses. People here are telling you that the assessment of cheating is independent of the quality of the paper. You are asserting that the accusation of cheating is an indication of the quality of the paper. While we all understand how upsetting it is to fail a class, the fact of the matter is that you need to set aside your personal thoughts about the quality of the paper and deal with the fact that your paper has been judged as being of relatively low quality (below 65%, as you say in one of your comments). Nothing you say will change what the person grading your paper has said about the quality of your work.

This may difficult to reconcile. I'll give you an example of how this can happen. A paper may raise concerns with a professor for using vocabulary which the professor doesn't think the student knows based on their interactions. The vocabulary would indicate cheating. That vocabulary may be used poorly, however, and the structure of the paper could still be terrible. The professor, however, would stop reading at the point the vocabulary issue came up. Your assignment was a literature review. The comparable case for you would be that you did a good job of assembling the material but did very little to synthesize the material, show a deep understanding of how the literature is interrelated, or otherwise achieve the goals of the assignment. The lack of analysis would mean that your paper would sound like the papers you cite, and the paper would be of low quality. Your response to my comment should not be "no, and here's why you're wrong." Again, your thoughts on the quality of your work are immaterial given that a grade has been assigned. 

This doesn't mean you don't have recourse. You could appeal to the Dean and ask for additional information (i.e. feedback, a graded copy of the paper, etc.) to better understand the decision. You could also request an additional person grade the paper given the rather difficult circumstances. I would approach asking for these things in a matter-of-fact manner rather than using emotion. Your grade is your grade, not a matter for negotiation or emotion. At the end of the day, this may not be resolved in your favor. 

Edit: I intended to wish you well at the end of the post. I hope that you work out something that benefits you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the previous point was more about the ability to harness that economic power rather than about GDP measurements. China was not always a single country as it is today. Long periods of warring within the country meant that China was often inward looking rather than seeking out trade and economic dominance. What good is GDP if it all goes to war efforts with regular people suffering as a result? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree with the idea that OP loses the right to be bothered by the student's behavior if any truth can be attributed to the complaint. OP can absolutely hold it against the student that they behaved in an unnecessarily nasty way, at least as presented by the OP. Feeling aggrieved doesn't give you the right to lash out. Sure, OP should recognize their own power in this situation and be fair about what they say. That's not the same as giving a positive reference just because the students inappropriately presented complaint had some small ring of truth to it.

<TEXT> Reading this article and the related commentary is positively infuriating. As a liberal, I loved watching all of the garbage poll unskewing that Republican commentators engaged in. The idea that Nate Silver is being maligned and accused of such behavior is beyond the pale. It's even more galling when you consider the source: the fucking Huffington Post, a true liberal equivalent of Fox News. Sure, it's fun to read that stuff if you want to feel good, but it's not "nutritious." 

The fact of the matter is that Nate Silver has consistently had a more cautious model incorporating higher levels of uncertainty compared to Sam Wang over the past few cycles. This is a feature, not a bug. It reflects the small sample size of elections to base poll behavior projections on, along with uncertainty related to undecided and third party voters. He provides ongoing discussions of his model and thoughtful commentary about the election and potential outcome scenarios. Sam Wang also does these things, but his model is clearly less cautious. Personally, is rather have a cautious model than an overconfident one...cautious models motivate voters to vote on all sides, something we should want as a society. 

Get an advanced degree in statistics and then you can criticize him. Sam Wang may disagree on the methodology, but I know for certain he wouldn't malign Nate Silver's bona fides. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is exactly the type of bloviation mentioned in the article here. Your comment is premised on the idea that Nate Silver assigns the probability on a day-to-day basis. In fact, his mode remains little changed from what he used to predict the last two presidential elections. What's different this time is there are two third-party candidates which leads his model to build in higher levels of outcome uncertainty. 

If you were to read the various commentaries he offers on the model, you'd understand these things. Even when his model showed an 84% chance of her winning, he was talking about why third party strength and poll variance made that 16% a non-negligible amount of variation compared to Obama's probability with a similar lead in the polls back in 2012. He likened a 16% chance to "the chance of winning (or getting shot during) a game of Russian Roulette." 

Instead, people try to take the model probabilities and interpret them in isolation or without a firm understanding of what they represent. He's not hedging at any percentage, he's making an empirical observation of outcome uncertainty based on poll data and what he considers to be appropriate trend adjustments. He's fully transparent about the fact that he does this adjustment, along with disclosing his poll adjustments in a per-poll basis. He also acknowledges, in these commentaries, most of the the things that this article points out about early voting and what not. His discussion of why he doesn't include early voting is actually quite interesting if you take the time to seek it out and read it. 

Tl;dr - You can't act like insert anti-science political part here and deny reality when your liberal statistical idol suddenly has his model come up with conservative estimates. Learn more, behave better! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suppose the question here is whether there is broad agreement on the appropriateness of smoothing for the purpose of trend line adjustment. 538 clearly makes use of this type of adjustment, but why don't other poll aggregators (if indeed they don't)? 

It seems to me that some sort of smoothly parameter is appropriate given that old polls will not reflect the effects of news on current voting intentions. Once you accept that premise, the argument over the appropriate smoothing parameter or method becomes the primary discussion. Granted, this can become a very contentious point of discussion. Still, it leaves other pollsters who don't adjust for trend lines in the indefensible position of using poorly constructed models.

<TEXT> My assertion of the number of estimates was also arbitrary. I wouldn't just use an estimate like that arbitrarily in practice, however. I selected it based on a desire to keep the task under 30 minutes total. Assuming 30-45 seconds per estimate, I figure that would fit in along with the required demographic questions and other reported measures used in the study. I'd then have an RA act as a participant in order to see if my assumptions are reasonable. Then I'd pilot test the experiment before running it in full to ensure that the results are promising enough to warrant a full experiment. If I got marginally significant results, for example, I might consider adjusting the number of estimates depending on whether I thought fatigue was setting in or more days might help separate the "signal from the noise."

Edit: While the science underpins the theory and predictions, the experimental design can be a bit of an art, in my opinion. It takes some trial and error to determine how many estimates you'll need, but experience can give you a better starting point and tighten up how long it takes to arrive at the right estimate.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will second this information, but from the perspective of someone who knows a bit about academic labor markets. Philosophy is the first field I think of when I think "why would someone pursue that PhD?" It's not that I have no respect for the field...I've taken a number of philosophy course which have had a substantive impact on my life and research. The work is important and contributes greatly to society. 

The fact is that the market-based functions which have been gradually imposed on universities have placed them at the mercy of both students and market economics. Small class sizes make it impractical to hire research-active philosophy professors, who need course release time to do good work. Students who might have viewed philosophy as a way to prepare for graduate school in law or the humanities are instead choosing "flashier" courses of study (I'll avoid mentioning names). Resources instead go to professional programs and business schools which teach bigger average classes and attract more students. That's in addition to the other frivolous expenditures mentioned above. 

The end result can be seen by looking at a random urban community college philosophy faculty group. LaGuardia Community College has two tenure-track professors with PhDs from top-15 philosophy phd programs (NYU and Memphis). More importantly, almost all of them have PhDs. Compare this to a field with a heathy job market and you'll find a CC department filled with Master's degrees instead with possibly a single PhD. These jobs basically have no significant research requirement to get tenure, instead loading up professors with 4 or 5 courses per semester. Pay is low...I know high school teachers who make more than community college professors, quite frankly. 

That's all assuming the rosy scenario where you get any sort of tenure track job. The odds are against that, in which case you're left to cobble together a meager living in academia by teaching multiple courses at multiple universities per semester on a contingent bases. It's all too dreary to adequately describe in a Reddit post. 

If we can convince just you, OP, to not pursue a philosophy PhD and a subsequent academic career, I'll consider it a triumph! If you pursue the PhD anyway, I'll consider it a success if you do so only with full funding and the knowledge that you won't be a professor afterward.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my PhD cohort, one student was asked to leave at the end of the first semester. Another classmate described the circumstances aptly, saying "Some people are weak in one area and strong in others. She was weak in everything!" I know at least one student in each subsequent cohort who left under similar circumstances. Basically, it quickly became clear they wouldn't be able to succeed in the program due to a lack of requisite skills (quantitative, writing, etc.) and they were asked to leave. In each case, the lack of skills was evidenced by multiple C/D/F grades. The first girl got an F and 2 Ds, another got a D and 2 Cs. Sub-B grades are a good indicator of sub-par performance, and multiple such grades should give you pause. This may be just the norms of my school, but I don't think so...it jives with what others have said about their schools. 

You know your performance better than others, however. Take the time to look at your performance and consider if you are lacking in one or more critical skills. Are your grades sub-B? Are you getting a lot of negative feedback? Don't just fade away...talk to your professors. They aren't going to be shy about sharing their assessment of your work, believe me. 

Edit: that grade threshold also held for my master's program. Sub-B grades in master's programs are, in my view and the view of a number of my colleagues, as good as failing grades.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You make a very good point about a control group. Because the experiment is using an estimation task which may be subject to learning effects, you want to make sure that what you're observing is attributable to the intervention and not to learning to estimate better over the course of the experiment. 

In terms of how many estimates should be required, I would have said 10 pre and 10 post. If you could get more estimates, like 15-20, you may even be able to rule out learning effects by showing no appreciable difference in accuracy within the pre-test period. That could support you not having a control group, though I still think one is preferred for this type of study.

<TEXT> Perhaps the point your professor is, trying to make, however inartfully, is that economic models flopped in the period surrounding the 2008 recession. The assumptions built into the models were sufficiently unrealistic as to render them useful for predicting the recession which occurred. For example, one assumption in the models of the time involved the availability of unlimited amounts of credit. A huge issue during the period just prior to the recession, however, was the subprime mortgage crisis. Credit basically dried up a banks tried to maintain capital levels and avoid lending money to people with dubious creditworthiness. They didn't account for the role of regulation in the drying up of credit as banks couldn't demand a sufficiently high risk premium from certain classes of borrowers due to maximum interest rate restrictions. They also didn't account for a variety of externalities, including bank default, which were a significant factor in the recession and in destabilizing the economic system. 

How does this lead them to share some blame for the recession? Had these models been more realistic, regulators might have behaved differently prior to the recession in ways that might have headed off the worst of the recession. The fact that we now have bank stress tests and higher levels of regulatory capital requirements are a direct reflection of the refinement of our economic models in the wake of the financial crisis. Had they performed better during the crisis, we still may have been able to better deal with the recession once it hit. Granted, the intransigence of Congress, particularly the decision to limit Government spending at a time when prior Governments would have expanded such spending, were a more direct cause of the persistence of the recession (in my opinion and in the opinion of economists like Paul Krugman) than simple model error. Nevertheless, better functioning models may have done a better job at convincing Congress to initiate Government spending. 

tl;dr - The models are to blame because they didn't head off the recession or prepare us to deal with it once it arrived.  </TEXT>

In a very liberal guy, even progressive in some of my political views. I used to read Salon in rotation with other left-leaning sites (e.g. Politico, Slate, TPM).

These days, though, they're just anti-Republican in such a ridiculous manner that I feel embarrassed on their behalf. Click-bait titles, opinion journalism, and sometimes straight-up manipulation of facts.

<TEXT> The only thing that might have caught someone's attention is the statement addresses for some of these accounts. Perhaps there should have been a check in place to look for differences in statement address across a single customer's accounts to catch some of this fraud. But that is a post hoc suggestion based on our knowledge of what happened. Who would even think about fraudulent accounts created in-house? We would have been focused on the account documentation process, something which would have been in order based on what I've read.  </TEXT>

Alternatively, you might talk to a professor at your school in the fields you're thinking of pursuing in order to get some idea of what studies are like in those fields. 

I'm sorry this isn't more targeted advice, but I think you'll do better by broadening your search.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One wonders if you all could afford things if you both spent as much on discretionary purchases as she does right now? If not, that seems to be a basic inequity in the relationship which will continue to manifest itself in arguments like this. You prefer to make rare, high dollar purchases while she prefers to make more frequent, lower dollar purchases. You shouldn't be punished for how you choose to time your purchases, particularly if (as it sounds) you aren't spending as much as her. 

Despite your misgivings, I'd suggest you really consider revisiting the rule just to avoid friction. If she considers rules to be hard and fast while ignoring the underlying principle, that seems to directly conflict with your view of rules at least in this case.  </TEXT>

Women aren't ever to blame for being raped despite the willingness of our society to take that blame from the rapist and force it onto you.

<TEXT> I don't know why you'd need a specific penalty for their being late. They simply get less time to take the exam, meaning that they should get a lower grade because of it. Your A students aren't the ones coming in late. Granted, I've never had 7 students come late for an exam...and I teach sections of 120. Even for the combined final, it's never more than 3 or 4. You might want to consider why they're coming late and deal with that issue instead. 

The main issue from my perspective is minimizing disruption. I save spots at the very front of the room to ensure they aren't unduly disruptive when they come in, give them the stink eye, stuff an exam in their hand and point to a chair in an irritated fashion.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Now there's a claim you don't hear every day, that religions and cults are the same thing. You should explain that dubious generalization rather than clearing up your example. 

Edit: At the risk of inviting more downvotes, I'd appreciate replies that are a bit less obtuse than a detailed explanation of the nuances of the definitions of the words. In today's society, cult and religion have very different connotations. To say the two are the same is essentially an indictment of religion. That a broad conception of cult can be found to fit the definition of religion is irrelevant. 

Also, I say this not as a religious person in any sense of the word. So I'm not personally offended by the comparison. I just think it's unfair.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a good place to start, I agree. The thing that you also want to consider is that each throw of the die is independent, so you're going to be multiplying the probabilities of the individual die throws together to arrive at the probability of the scenario.

Consider the first scenario you mention, the probability of all odd numbers. Each die has 3 odd and 3 even numbers, so your probability of throwing an odd number is 3/6=.5. With three die, each has a probability of .5 of turning up odd. Thus, the probability of all three turning up odd is .5 * .5 * .5 = .125.

Start from the single die and work from there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This isn't a great solution, but perhaps you can insist on all communication being in writing. This would create both distance and documentation. If this isn't possible, at least recap all discussions I writing to document who said what when. The biggest concern is that the sociopath will steal your work. Written records makes this less likely to happen. 

Also, be sure to keep discussions restricted to the project at hand. Don't discuss anything else. This will prevent you from revealing too much and making yourself expendable.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> While an individual job in accounting may not feel like it matters, accounting serves an essential function from a cultural and societal standpoint. It's more than just merely serving capital markets. 

At its core, accounting facilitates economic activity by serving a recordkeeping function. Audited reports largely replace the need for trust between market participants in our society, allowing people to go about their day and engage in routine economic transactions that allow for economic specialization. People don't have to worry about growing their own food, for example, because accounting reassures them that food is a available elsewhere. Food can get to supermarkets because accounting facilitates distribution systems and inventory management. Accounting also lets us plan our own economic activity as individuals through budgeting, allowing us to know for certain that we can eat today (or, worst case, that we can't).

We may not cure cancer, but we make it so that doctors can devote their time to doing so. I think that's a pretty big deal! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like I've seen this type of game played before, but I've never seen it done in a useful way like this fellow does it. It really forces you to think about what your position and solid mixed play strategy on every single hand since you can't just mechanically evaluate the hand against a mental bank. I found it a bit challenging to keep up with his line of reasoning at first, but by the end I found it compelling. Of course, I wouldn't subject myself to that limitation at a 200nl table. At lower stakes, though, it could be a good training exercise. 

Now if he could just never drink from that bottle again on camera, i'd be happy. I'm afraid to catch another of his videos for fear of a repeat on that chugging, splashing noise. :-/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well...there are some places where you're the person who wrote the only book on the topic. Or, in other cases, you're the person who wrote the most popular textbook. Granted, the appearance is not good when you assign your own text. I'd never do it, though I'd never write a textbook. Still, in some cases it's appropriate to assign a self-authored text for class. 

I had an Econ prof as an undergrad who write his own book and used it to teach a course. Only charged us copy costs. It was a terrible book, but luckily he was a solid teacher. So that can happen too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are many situations life will present you which can be approached in a variety of ways. An assignment like this, for example, can be treated as an opportunity for deep introspection or written off as a waste of time (or something in between). Neither is necessarily right or wrong, but each has implications for your personal development...that is, if you accept that every situation presents an opportunity for growth. Expending effort in one situation means you might not have effort to expend somewhere else. Thus, there is clearly some opportunity cost to your decisions. 

At the end of the day, what we take from our activities will inevitably be a function of what we put into that activity. It's always your decision, therefore, as to how much effort or thought you will expend on any specific activity. In my opinion, your asking the question as to how to approach this assignment is a really good sign. 

I know this isn't an answer to your specific question, but I hope you find it to be an applicable bit of life advice which will help you make these decisions for yourself in a more thoughtful way.  </TEXT>

Being child free is a legitimate and perfectly fine choice on its own. Set aside any guilt you may feel knowing that by not taking them in under duress, you're giving these kids an opportunity to find homes with families that will give them the love and support they need.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a professor, I'd like to give my two cents and tell you not to pursue this. There are one of two possibilities here that are most probable. 

1. He is a professor and looks at you like a student.  This means that you probably look like a child to him. I don't mean that he thinks your childish. Rather, I look out at my class and the students physically look like high school kids to me. Even the "attractive" ones are not attractive to me because it seems almost like pedophilia to be checking them out. He meets your eyes because he's actively looking around the room for eyes to meet. That's how he can tell if the class (aka the children) understand what he's saying. Everything you think your seeing with respect to your connection, therefore, is, at best, paternalistic and, at worst, nonexistent. 

2. He's a creep and is actively trying to lure you in with his gaze. Any professor who would seek to hook up with a student (and I know some who have) is doing so with the full knowledge that they are the strong party in the relationship. Students are the limpy gazelle of the classroom savannah and the professor is the proud lion, hunting his prey. He's attracted to you, therefore, as a conquest and not as a person. 

The most logical scenario is 1 based on your comments. If you seek him out, you're more than likely to embarrass yourself. Frankly, I'd report a student who made a pass at me. It may not be illegal or against the rules for you to do so, but you may end up in the Dean's office nonetheless. 

So, for your sake and for his, stop now and proceed no further with this! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely this! In addition, you should report the priest who performed this baptism to the Archdiocese. Doing baptisms of children without the consent of their parents is explicitly against the rules. Even if your mother lied and said she is the legal guardian, the priest should have check that and verified it. This is the kind of behavior that gives Christians, not just Catholics, a bad name. 

Of course, initiating that action would also allow you to confirm if your husband authorized things. That information is important as well. I'm not sure what I would do if he authorized the baptism, but clearly you aren't overreacting here. 

Edit: So...I looked this up and was surprised that it is apparently no longer possible to formally defect from the Catholic Church. They apparently removed this act from the legal code of the Church in 2009. I'm incensed at reading that because it now seems there isn't anything that can be done, short of legal action (which is absolutely something I would suggest you consider depending on your means), to remove yourself from the roster of the Catholic Church.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a large guy, I've certainly run into chasers (as they are called in the gay community) before. There's a big difference between a chaser and someone who simply likes larger people. What your boyfriend seems to be describing isn't really a fat fetishist. He's not placing the focus on your weight in your relationship or your sex life. If the concern is that he won't continue to find you sexy, I think you know that won't happen based solely on how he's reacted to this revelation. I could tell you some stories...weird ones. :-/

The real issue here is that in revealing his preferences, he has left you feeling insecure. By telling you how his "ideal" woman looks, he's left you to compare yourself to an ideal. Up until now, you have been able to assume you are his ideal looking woman. Now you know you haven't been until recently and that you will be moving away from his ideal as you drop weight. I don't really think this is a matter of trust...after all, he was forthright when asked even if he wasn't forthcoming. What kind of asshole says "I'd like your body better if it were different?" I think it's unfair of you to expect that he would have shared this information about his preferences since they are essentially non-actionable. He could ask you to wear a corset or slap him around a bit. He can't ask you to put on weight...that's just not done. So now when it comes time to be with your boyfriend, you're left with this underlying insecurity regarding your looks and his interest in them. That's not really a great start to sexy times. 

My partner loves me. I'm quite sure I'm not his ideal type. His exes have all been smaller than me. We both look at conventionally hot guys when rarely we talk about such things. If he were to explicitly confirm those suspicions, however, it would be devastating. If he were to say that I'm actually his ideal looking guy, I'd probably be even more self-conscious since I'd feel pressure to maintain this look when I'd rather lose pounds. It's a no-win situation all around when someone says stupid stuff like that! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did an undergraduate degree in the arts and have a business-related PhD. My decision to pursue the humanities undergraduate was actually a last-minute change. Prior to that, I had thought to get an undergraduate degree in the same field as my PhD. I figured, however, that your "dreams" can more easily be pursued in your youth. After working in the field of my degree for several years, however, i decided to switch back to my original plan and pursue the business degree. 

My main suggestion would be to have a plan. My pursuit of a PhD took 10 years from the point to when i identified it as the desired outcome to when I graduated. I researched what the degree entailed and read articles in the field to ensure that I was willing to do the research and that my interests were represented in the literature. I picked schools to apply to that supported that research. I went back to school for a master's degree, but not before taking a few undergraduate classes to make sure that I really wanted to go through with studying that field for an extended period of time. Once in the master's program, I told all my professors my plan and was able to get some good guidance on pursuing the degree. It was a very intentional process and I took steps to make sure that I was fully invested the whole way. 

Getting a PhD is a long and trying process. If you don't love what you're doing, you are going to have a hard time being persistent enough to finish. Good luck to you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> See...this is the trouble with people lumping all social justice activities together. Feminists and members of the Black Lives Matter movement can and do have legitimate grievances regarding the treatment of certain groups in our society. This is not the same as some random undergraduate whining because they have to consider other viewpoints that aren't their own.

The behavior you're describing here (your own behavior) seems to me to be the hallmarks of a manager or, by extension, a company that doesn't care about people who are different from them. You might like to have a workplace where you're free to tell off-color jokes, for example, or insult and yell at each other without repercussions. 

If that's what you are (and I strongly suspect that to be the case), that's certainly a choice you can make. It's to your detriment that you're unwilling to entertain the merits of people with different positions from yours, from my perspective. You don't have to share my perspective, however, and that's also a choice you can make. 

Don't hop on your high horse here and try to pretend that what you're doing is some noble defense of free speech, however, or standing up for traditional values. Recognize it as exclusionary and own that.

<TEXT> Sorry to take so long in replying...the term begins next week and I've been swamped. 

I think your case may be one where a DBA makes sense. Of course, you'll want to pick one with a strong placement record and which meets your needs for residency (i.e. Low residency program so you can continue to work). Clearly the money is an issue for you such that even a stipend plus loans isn't going to allow you to focus on a traditional PhD. That's a perfectly good reason to choose a DBA over a PhD. The local schools you reference are likely ones that are more teaching focused...they'd probably be glad to have a DBA on the faculty. Check the credentials of people at those schools for comparison of you want to be sure. You can ask PM me specific schools for some input on what they are probably looking for in a job candidate so you don't out your location publicly. 

With that said, it isn't clear to me how you'd overcome the main difference between the degrees - the research experience. A PhD program puts you in touch with other research active people and a mentor, or multiple mentors, who guide your progress. You are forced to read piles of papers and become an expert in your chosen area. You immerse yourself in the research work and finish your degree with a dissertation befitting that commitment. I just don't see how you could find that sort of mentor after the fact at the type of schools that would hire you with a DBA. Faculty at those schools teach a full load of classes and often aren't all that research active in the first place. They won't have time to guide your research progress in the same way a PhD program is equipped to do. 

This need not be an obstacle to your pursuing a DBA, however. If your main goal is to teach, a DBA from a reputable program with a strong placement record could be enough to get you there. Research doesn't have to be a huge part of your career. Getting the DBA is basically a choice to focus on teaching after you finish...and that's a fine choice. If, however, you want to focus on research after finishing your doctorate (also a fine choice), the DBA simply isn't enough to reach that goal. 

I hope this helps. Feel free to ask more questions as they come up, either here or by PM.

I'm left wondering, however, how well the auditor can ascertain whether or not the Army is following its own accounting procedures. The use of estimates is all part of the game, as we all know. It shouldn't be any surprise, therefore, that adjustments are later made in order to reconcile estimates to actually. An auditor should be able to figure out (1) whether the estimates were made according to relevant standards and company policy, and (2) whether those estimates are reasonable. The fact that the financial statements are disclaimed the way they are suggests that they can't even figure out if they've followed their own policies. If the auditor could determine the Army followed its own policies, they'd only have to assess the policies in order to answer the second question. Even if they only have internal auditors and didn't subject themselves to external scrutiny up until now, those internal auditors should be able to answer those questions as well. It sounds like they may have a manpower issue rather than a systems issue from what I'm reading. 

Of course, I may be misinterpreting all that...I was never an auditor and only did reporting work on the management side. Please correct me if I'm mistaken.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like it is impacting his obligations based on what you say here, at least to some extent. If "forever" is hours, he's kind of leaving you all hungry while he's off playing games. If it's 15 minutes, perhaps it's not so big a deal.

One of the signs of addiction is that it interferes with your life in one of several ways. So long as he's still getting his work done, making time for his friends and family, and maintaining his usual life routine, it's probably an acceptable level of playing. If he's withdrawing, avoiding work to play games, and basically excluding everything but the game, it's probably a problem. Here is some info on video game addiction for you to read for your own information:

<TEXT> There's a lot that could be said on this topic, but I'm a bit pressed for time so let me offer a few salient points for you to consider in making your choice. 

1. Training Depth and Breadth - A traditional PhD program in business takes 4-5 years to complete. Those extra years are used mainly used to further your development as a researcher. You're completely focused on your studies as a PhD student since most business programs offer you a stipend, so you learn the nuances of academic writing and digesting research papers. More importantly, you learn to think about research. A 3- year program simply cannot offer you the same depth of experience in thinking about research. Having read some of the dissertations from graduates of this sort of DBA and having worked with such graduates, their work tends to be compulsory and surface rather than making deep contributions to their fields. 

This isn't necessarily bad. Most business fields have outlets for practice-oriented work which this type of DBA can prepare you to do. It won't likely be enough to get you tenure, however, at anything other than a relatively low-ranked program. More importantly, the training you receive won't really set you up to stay up to date with the research in your area. It's hard to digest research papers without a complete knowledge of statistics and research methods. 

(Note: The Kennesaw program at least has the benefit of employing Joe Hair, a noted expert in multivariate statistics and the author of an influential textbook.)

2. Employment Prospects - you mentioned all the people employed out of the program you referenced. A review of their student cohorts, however, reveal a number of people without jobs from recent cohorts. This suggests (notice I say suggests rather than proves...I can't prove this despite having some first-hand knowledge of what I'm saying) the marketplace may have gotten some signal about the quality of their graduates based on earlier graduates. A DBA such as the one you're referencing is viewed askance by the academics who would be hiring you for a tenure-track position. At my school, we wouldn't even consider you for a teaching-only clinical position with that degree. This is mainly because of...

3. Lack of Teaching Training - PhD programs in business generally offer assistantships. Even if it's only a single class, that assistantship gets you some practical experience at dealing with students and teaching. You might run your own class or simply assist a professor with their class, but the experience is invaluable in preparing you for a job in which you'll have to teach. DBA programs like the one you reference don't generally offer this training. 

4. Money - You don't generally pay for a business PhD. You generally pay for a DBA. The loans you would take for a DBA could be taken as cash and, when combined with a PhD stipend, could be used to support you for a PhD of living off the stipend isn't feasible based on your living situation. 

There are my two cents. Good luck to you as you think more about this important choice! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Setting aside any discussion of the merits of your career since you don't seem to want to discuss that, it sounds like the people in your life are some mixture of concerned for your economic future and jealous of the perceived freedom you have because you don't have a "real" job. You could take one more crack at using evidence to sway their opinion, but it seems like there is a fundamental disagreement between you and them in terms of what an appropriate way to live your life is. They may never accept what you do, in which case you will need to find others who accept you as is and stop discussing work with these current friends (or cut them out entirely). As for your GF...well, she shouldn't have the option of benefiting from your money and insulting how you make it at the same time. :-/


Perhaps a good way to deal try approaching them is to show them how seriously you take handicapping. Don't show your current bank account figure, state something like "I spend X hours a week studying and handicapping football matches and average y dollars per week from my hard work." You've been at it for long enough that you have a solid set of results to use for support.  </TEXT>

The better question here is "what can she say that will allow me to get past this?" You're going to have to communicate about it, that much is clear. What can she say that would make it better? "I wasn't saying that as a complaint. I love sex with you and think your penis is perfect for me?" That might do it. Short of that, I feel like you are going to have a hard time trusting her with personal things when you know she's so careless that she's attack your sexual ego in such an obvious way.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Something about your description of things bothers me. I think it's the way that you seem to gloss over throwing your sister under the bus by telling your aunts and uncles that you didn't get to visit them because of your sister a discomfort. This isn't to say that you shouldn't be upset about having been kept separated from your family. But blaming a young girl for that decision makes no sense to me. The blame for that falls squarely on your parents, who kept you away despite your asking them directly to take you on your own. Now that you've basically ratted her out and blamed her for not being as social within the group as you, you've destroyed any future chance she might have had at integrating herself within your family. In essence, you have achieved what your mother set out to avoid: you've permanently excluded her. 

Despite your protestations, I get a real sense that you resent your sister. Personally, I think this resentment is misplaced.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is nonsense. He spends the whole post acknowledging that he feels bad because his sister is clearly great at the job. He also clearly acknowledges his jealousy. Why should he be grateful for a good looking sister? That's creepy and wrong-headed. Looks aren't everything! The OP clearly gets what's going on here and feels appropriately bad about it. 

The fact here is that the OP has a problem that lots of people have - he's got a sibling that seems to be overshadowing him. She's good looking, more popular, and at least as competent as him. The difference is that, unlike most people, he can't get away from his sibling and strike out on his own, feel his own success. Sure, he may love his sister and enjoy her company. But he's constantly having to face his own relative lack of popularity. He used to have a job he could feel some independent success in, but with his sister there even that has become less satisfying because she's clearly better than him at the job. Pus, she's gossiping about him being possibly gay? His sister...sounds needy despite having it all (on a relative basis)z

Are his feelings of jealousy and anger wrong? No. They're natural for someone who has probably felt overshadowed by his sister all his life. 

Are they going to go away? Also no. Certainly not when having to face them every day by living with her and working in the same place. 

I think the OP should at least find a new job. Don't discuss it with the sister, though...that's just looking for sympathy. Get the new job, give notice at the video game store, and move on. If that isn't enough to start feeling some independent success, consider moving out. Again, don't consult your family. They seem content to sacrifice his happiness to ensure his sister's happiness.  Once you are feeling more secure in yourself, OP, you can rebuild your relationship with your sister on more solid ground.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I also think this is the way to go here. Basically, whatever middle school game of dominance he was trying to play with you is over and he lost.  Badly. You won, you both know it. Now it's just a matter of how you choose to win. 

Personally, I think saying nothing and treating him as neutrally as you can is not only the right thing to do, but also the most personally satisfying thing to do. He clearly knows what is going on and is deliberately avoiding your gaze because of it. If he brings it up, let him know that personal feelings have no place in the workplace. If he doesn't, he will have to deal with knowing he works for the guy he bullied and wonder when the proverbial other shoe will drop. Torment him with your success and good grace

When you go to apply for a different job, the hiring manager will look for two things: the letters "CPA" and your work experience. You only need credits. If the cheaper online program will count for those credits, go for it. Check and see if there are other, cheaper in-state options online first.

<TEXT> Now that's an interesting point about how much they're willing to let the client know. Niantic seems very concerned with people's ability to know where Pokemon are with any certainty. Even the original tracking feature requires effort to wander around and narrow down the range until you find them. Given that they've suggested the current version of the game represents very little of the full vision for the game, I wonder if they have a preference for the server-side version of things in order to facilitate some future product or micro transaction functionality. 

If they had wanted to use a client-side approach, I can't imagine they wouldn't have been able to do so. I'm not a tech person and I can clearly understand the concept after reading the comments here. I feel like the choice of a server-side model was deliberate and chosen to avoid cheating.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A year or two ago, I caught six students plagiarizing with TurnItIn on a single take-home exam where I told them twice that I'd be electronically checking for plagiarism and explicitly told them they couldn't collaborate. 

Cut to me hearing a fourth student tell me the answers were exactly the same because they studied together and prepared answers for those questions before the exam (not possible given the specific nature of the questions), subsequently losing my mind, and telling her off for lying to me until she cried. Students five and six took their F's gracefully without even showing up to contest them.

<TEXT> I agree with everyone else here who is telling you to cooperate with your mother and go visit the psychiatrist for a bit. I'm going to take a more practical approach, however, and suggest an incentive for you to go to see the psychiatrist. 

You've been spending time checking out pictures of guys online...a perfectly natural thing for a gay person to do at your age. Have you ever given any thought about how to move from looking at pictures to actually going on dates with real guys? If you don't love yourself as you are, gayness and all, how will you be able to go out and feel comfortable going on a date?

I've been where you are. I was a young closeted gay guy who looked at pictures and dated girls to try and hide. It wasn't until I couldn't take the lack of fulfillment anymore and went to see a therapist that I got the answers I needed to move on. Years later, I have a partner and love my life (well, most of it). But none of it would have been possible without someone non-judgmental to talk to about my feelings. A stranger, you see, is exactly who you want to listen to the embarrassing and worrisome secrets you don't want to tell anyone else. After all...who gives a damn what a stranger thinks of you? Right? 

So, in conclusion...if you won't go for your Mom, go for the makeouts it will help you enjoy in the future! Also, good luck to you!

Edit: It's not clear what religion you are from your post. As someone who has spent a lot of time in Church, however, I can tell you that the parts of the Bible pertaining to homosexuality are...well, let's say open to interpretation. There's a three chapter section of Leviticus where we've basically just kept some of the rules and not others depending on whether or not the rules make sense to our modern understanding of things. Why we have rejected the prohibition on wearing mixed fabrics yet kept the prohibition on homosexuality is beyond me and many other people. When someone is telling you to hate yourself and promising you eternal damnation, you get to give their words extra special scrutiny. I encourage you to do some research on your own and see what conclusion you come to.  </TEXT>

That wouldn't sufficiently explain it to them despite the fact that a therapist would probably "get" the problem instantly.  

It's not that you aren't intelligent, it's that you aren't interested. Their badgering had made it almost a point of pride for you not to be proficient in coding. I get it. I have a similar block with a certain foreign language that my father speaks. Even if I were fluent, I'll be damned if I let him hear me speak it. 

I feel like this is something you should be talking to a therapist about. It sounds like there are some family and relationship dynamics here which aren't particularly helpful to your career development. I doubt they're trying to be mean or anything...they sound like they want the best for you and are trying to achieve that with their suggestions.

With that said, it sounds as if you have a bit of a phobia surrounding your use of computers and coding at this point. That's not surprising given all the pressure you've received to engage with those things. Nevertheless, it's going to be a hindrance to you in the future of you don't find a way to open yourself up more to specific kinds of computer-based experiences.

<TEXT> I really don't see a problem here, though certainly not for lack of effort in trying to find one. 

It seems like he took care to acknowledge the numerous people who provided input into the paper. It could be that one of the acknowledged provided enough of a contribution that they'd receive a co-authorship credit. However, by signing off on the publication of the paper as required by JAMA, those people have essentially stated that wasn't the case. Even if you think the President used the power of his position to bully one or more of the acknowledged into forgoing a co-authorship claim...well, that sort of thing happens in academia too. This doesn't make it right, of course, but it does mean that the President isn't necessarily a special case. I have no trouble believing that a Constitutional Law professor with an Ivy League background could, with assistance in gathering facts, write an article of this caliber. 

Additionally, as a special communication, it seems clear that JAMA is conceding that this is more of a position paper rather than original research. The conflict of interest here isn't of the typical variety where there is some financial benefit to be gained. Instead, it's of the very common variety where his legacy and reputation stands to benefit from publication. That's true for every academic. Of course, if you think he didn't write it the perhaps you think he doesn't deserve the reputational benefits of the article. But to suggest he should disclaim a conflict of interest in a law that everyone knows he pushed for because he wants it to succeed seems to be holding the President to a higher publication standard than we hold ourselves to. We all want our work to succeed!

I'm going to go out in a limb and make a generalization. I think a certain type of academic, generally an early career one, will look at this article and say "they wouldn't have published that if I had written it." That's likely true. We see many instances of senior people in our respective fields getting away with the kind of normative, rather than positivist, writing which the President submitted for publication. This is perhaps best used as evidence of a lack of equity in academia. This isn't new, however, and it isn't isolated to the President. It's merely another piece of evidence in support of the idea that academia ain't fair.

<TEXT> I was always taught to look for ways to extend the conversation based on what the other person said. People usually don't reveal everything at once. For the party example you provide, for instance, you could have asked her how she was enjoying the party. You could have complimented her on something or thanked her for the invitation. You could have asked her about what it takes to plan a party like the one she had - "this must have been a lot of work!" 

Basically, the first step to good conversation is listening to the other person. Once you hear what they have to say, you can find something that interests you the most about what they said and use it to continue the conversation. 

Another thing you can do to make people feel more at ease in your presence is to reveal things about yourself. Given that you have been bullied, you clearly want to be careful about what you reveal. I keep some basic bits of information handy that I can reveal without feeling too exposed (I'm a private person). If they're talking about music, share what your favorite band is. If someone is talking about having a hard time with school work, commiserate with them by sharing an anecdote about your school work.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your ability to admit that tells me that you're going to get through this alright, sir. 

With that said, I think you've gotten some good advice here. The most important thing is to find ways to meet other people within your comfort zone. A shared hobby, for example, can provide an excellent opportunity for conversation without all the stress of having to come up with what to say. As an introvert who recently moved somewhere new and had to rebuild a social network (albeit a small one), I know it doesn't have to be as excruciating as it seems at first glance. 

More important than the how, however, is the when. Don't go rushing into anything. Work on yourself first because you're worth the time and effort. Time spent grieving, truly grieving, a loss is much more productive than time spent trying to ignore the loss.

<TEXT> I'm going to say something that isn't a direct answer to your question,  but is nonetheless something I think you need to hear...

There is no amount of money you can give your mother and family to make her give you the love and respect you crave from her. None!

The entire pattern of behavior you describe here is a familiar one to me as it mimics what I've seen my dad do with his mom. After 20 years of sending money home faithfully to support his mother and family, his siblings flat out told him he couldn't have anything of his mother's when she passed away two months ago. Not a picture, not a piece of jewelry, not a handmade shirt or scarf...nothing. In the end, nothing he did was appreciated by any of them. It was always "more, more, where's the money?" It was always about gifts and money and things, never about love. 

If you take a moment and look deep inside yourself, you will know that this is true. Cut your losses and try enjoying the fruits of your hard work for once in your life. You'll feel better because the search for validation from a bunch of people who couldn't care less about your well-being will be over. 

As an aside, your sister and her fianc are in Italy right now? Is that on vacation? Why should they get to vacation while you scrimp and save for them to get married?

<TEXT> Your post reveals a bit of an attribution error which I'm not sure you're quite aware of. You present Carly as rational and clear-headed when she was escalating your physical relationship. Now that she is giving in to social pressure and de-escalating the physical, however, she has become some sort of dupe who isn't thinking clearly anymore. This is a self-serving line of reasoning that doesn't give her the full agency she deserves. 

The fact here is that you dove into a relationship with a religious girl dick-first and are now experiencing just how hard that can be. College is a time of questioning and people from a sheltered  and religious background can go through these Yoyo phases where they go back and forth from more to less strict in their lifestyle choices. She is probably really and truly conflicted about he sex life and how it matches her upbringing. 

Whatever you do, don't treat this change of heart as if it is temporary. You can't "make her see reason" on this matter. Instead, you need to treat this as the new state of your relationship and make decisions for yourself accordingly. If you stay it should be with the understanding that there is no more sex for the foreseeable future.  </TEXT>

Seriously, though, OP needs to read this several times and let it sink in. Mom wants an even split and an even split she shall have. Everything else in the post is the OP's personal issue and beside the point. Whatever decision the OP makes going forward, they should do it knowing the inheritance is set. 

Edit: I'm just going to reiterate the word boorish here. I just re-read your post and need to say how distressed I am that you'd quibble with your mom about the inheritance while she is dying. I cry when I even think of my mom dying! Spend more time enjoying your mom while she is still around and less time counting her money! </TEXT>

<TEXT> You aren't answering the main question asked by the last commenter. Would you give up contact with your brother to continue no contact with your sister if it were your only choice?

This is a critical question here because it is the only choice you really face right now. Your brother has threatened to stop talking to you if you won't contact your sister. You may feel he is being unduly influenced, but, like your sister was then, he is old enough to make his own choices. He is choosing her over you in this moment. You need to decide what you are willing to sacrifice in order to maintain your no contact status with the sister. 

Dealing with your brother isn't something that we will really be able to help you with. Your post gives us no solid basis upon which to really understand why he's making the decision to cut you off. As such, we can't instruct you on how to change his mind. We can all agree or disagree with your choice in dealing with your sister (I agree with the no contact for what it's worth) but that really doesn't matter because it doesn't help you in deciding how to deal with your sister. 

If you think your brother is bluffing, call his bluff. If you don't think he's bluffing, however, you need to decide if he's worth giving up no contact with your sister for. That's totally on you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. As a professor who has been on the receiving end of such offers, I can say such offers are very awkward. It leaves me worried, in my mind, that a student might think there is some debt to be repaid in the future. There's a power differential in a student-professor relationship. The less powerful person shouldn't be phony, IMHO. 

I know there are some cultural differences in this regard, however. My Chinese students, for example, are significantly more likely to try and pay the bill for some reason that I haven't worked out yet. Thus, this advice is intended for a US audience. Your mileage may vary.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are several comments here encouraging you to create some drama here. This is very unusual for /r/relationships to suggest, but I'm going to hop on the bandwagon and suggest it to. 

Everyone else in this situation seems to be getting what they want. Biomom doesn't have to see you, adoptive parents avoid drama, and the rest of the family wins the argument. Meanwhile, you're left feeling like some sort of leftover. 

Well, you aren't a leftover. You are a perfectly worthy person who is entitled to their feelings and entitled to be heard. I'm not sure how forcefully you are putting the point to your moms, but you absolutely need to make it clear you aren't going to put up with it anymore. If they aren't going to do the right thing and take your side, you need to let them know in no uncertain terms that their decision is going to cost them. 

If it were me, I'd go home and date the party attendees to do something about it. That may not be something you're comfortable with, however. Letting other people in your family circle know that you're being treated this way, however, is another way of putting up a fight. Use a Facebook message announcing you've been asked to leave and tag the whole lot of these people so their friends see what they've done. 

Also, consider talking to a counselor to help work through your feelings on all this. You don't deserve this treatment! </TEXT>

<TEXT> When your future career prospects are determined in large part by your GPA, it makes sense to use every tool at your disposal to maximize your GPA. Doing everything you can to get ahead is exactly how real life works. It's true that you may not get accommodations like this in the working world, but work tasks also tend to be much more specialized than course work. The two task environments aren't directly comparable, in my view. The trick is to learn strategies to cope with each environment separately.

<TEXT> Nope, nope, nope...this comment shows no understanding of how college works these days. While resiliency is a good character trait to have (along with that whole grit thing they talk about), this isn't about resiliency. This is about a professor making you indirectly feel bad about needing a disability accommodation. 

As a university professor, I'm told that accommodations are sacrosanct. You can "suck it up" when you join the working world, but for now you have every right to get whatever accommodation you're entitled to. The professor is opening the university up to legal liability by not complying with the ADA and your legitimate accommodation. 

Standing up for yourself is as important a learning experience as resiliency is a character trait.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Doesn't it seem like the only real change is Callie's newfound single status? Before, Callie had her own husband and life. Now, Callie is a single woman who is seeking comfort from the wife's husband. It's not logical given the nature of the relationship between OP and Callie, but there isn't much mystery to it in my mind as to the "why."

With that said, I agree that giving in to ultimatums is never a good idea. It empowers the person giving the ultimatum and often emboldens them to make other ultimatums. If your wife has a problem with Callie, she should make that problem known and have a reasonable conversation about it rather than issuing demands and ultimatums.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok...perhaps this isn't the place for this comment, but I can't let it go unsaid just in case you aren't aware of it. How did you manage to get a job teaching history at any college? That job market is awful and I'm incredibly impressed that you're working in the field. It just makes your wife's treachery that much more obvious...she clearly doesn't appreciate that you could be an unemployed top-50 research university PhD these days. 

With that said, I'd also be remiss if I didn't chime in and say that you shouldn't get a PhD in history to spite your wife...that could literally be a ruinous decision. I like the public "calling out" route because, frankly, your wife is a jerk who is clearly jealous of you and who doesn't appreciate you. 

Edit: Holy hell - I just went back and read that you said salary. That implies that you're full time. You have a full time job as a history professor?!? You have nothing to be self-effacing about with respect to your job, man. Jesus, you're a full-fledged unicorn! No joke.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll piggyback off the top comment and give an example of this in my own work. I'm an academic and I go to conferences several times a year. The actual conference stuff consists of various sessions which I may or may not have an interest in. I attend all the sessions in my sub area and use the rest of the time for fun. At each conference, my friends and I go and do some fun things after the sessions of the day are done. I was in Minneapolis last year and went for a drive to see the house they used in Mary Tyler Moore. Go to Chicago? Shop on the Magnificent Mile. I have tickets for the theatre in NYC when I go to a conference there in a few months. 

If he's a doctor, he might be doing actual business on the golf course - meeting with pharmaceutical reps, for example.

<TEXT> I'm not from the UK...I'm a business professor in the US who is scouring these pages to get some insight into how people on the ground in the UK feel about the vote. 

With that disclaimer, reading your comment gives me some insight into the disconnect between various classes (for lack of a better word) of people in society. What you say on its face is true - a 10% correction in an overinflated housing market isn't going to shatter the world in the long run, although it is likely to come along with (or directly cause) a recession in the short-to-medium term. 

For people who are actually affected by those market losses, however, those losses represent life changing amounts of money. A house loses 10% of its equity and the owner can potentially no longer sell it because they are upside-down on their mortgage. Builders lay off workers because they built houses expecting one profit margin and got another one. Retirement savings drop right as some people retire. These aren't academic issues for people...they are important personal finance issues which negatively impact their lives. 

When you minimize these issues, you minimize the lives of the people impacted by them. I'm certain you aren't trying to do this, but that's how it seems to them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I am playing through the game and I realize that I made a mistake in Bevelle Temple. I clearly used the destruction sphere, but I neglected to take the treasure on my way out. Now I'm thinking ahead to getting Anima. Am I screwed, or do I only have to use the destruction sphere and not take the treasure to fulfill the Baaj Temple requirements?

Thanks for your help! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would like to point out that OP has no responsibility for her sister's recovery. Her sister has to want to recover for herself. If her recovery is contingent upon forgiveness, it's going to be quickly derailed by those who refuse to forgive. Making amends is something her sister needs to do because it's right and not solely for forgiveness. 

Forgive or don't, OP, but don't let anyone guilt you into forgiveness you don't actually feel! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure what you're going to be able to find using the m-score and stock market reactions because the stock market effect will be directional while the m-score is not. You can probably expect companies to have different reactions to managing earnings up versus down. Additionally, beta is tricky since companies with earnings manipulation also tend to have smoother earnings and, by extension, less volatility in the marketplace. 

I wish I had a better suggestion for you, but tying it to something audit related isn't a bad idea. I hope it works out! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think some directness is called for here. I'd say your husband should handle things because it's his friend, but it sounds like you're comfortable talking to him too. Whoever does it, it's a matter of telling him that he has to move out. Give him a hard deadline and do it in writing just to make sure there isn't a problem from a legal standpoint (since he's living there, you'd basically be evicting him). 

I know you feel bad, but you shouldn't. He's taking advantage of you and your generosity here. Lying about how much he makes, eating you out of house and home, and butting into your conversations isn't what good house guests do.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The relationship you have with your current GF sounds really bad. First off, your GF shows very little trust in you by demanding to scour your internet activity in the first place. Second, the conversations you are having after the post was discovered are all about saying mean things to each other? That's really worrisome. The details of who lied when and about what are secondary to what is essentially a very unhealthy relationship. 

I'd accept that this relationship isn't meant to be and break things off. If you feel compelled to respond to the texts, simply say "I'm not going to engage in this fighting any more" before cutting off contact. Otherwise, just go no contact.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you're not wrong to be upset about this. There were many other ways for him to avoid speaking Korean (as seems to be his goal) without lying about understanding it. It's hard not to wonder if there wasn't some ulterior motive to him not telling you. I would be upset in this situation. 

The real question here is what this means for your relationship. His having lied to you clearly has some impact on the trust you place in him, at least in the short term. Do you think you can get past it? I think that's where you should be focusing your attention. It sounds like you're otherwise very happy with him. To some extent, his graciousness in the face of other people's rudeness is a credit to him. What really matters is whether you feel like this breach of trust is something you can get over. 

At the very least, I think you need to tell him exactly how you're feeling and make sure that he takes it seriously. This isn't a small issue even if you eventually decide to try and let it go.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember getting the NES version of FFI when it first came to the US. I loved movies about typical fantasy things - wizards and fighters - and couldn't wait to get my hands on the game so I could play it. As an 8 year-old, however, I really couldn't get too far into it as I didn't have much in the way of strategic thinking and found it too hard to play. By the time FF2 came along for SNES in the US (FF IV in the full progression) I was ready and waiting for a comeback.  That was the first RPG game I ever beat totally on my own. 

Nearly 25 years later, I've played them all and can't wait for the next iteration in the series! They're about the only games I play. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While the stuff about his privilege and argumentative personality is concerning, I'd like to take a different tack and point out his statement about "making small talk." Clearly, he finds a great deal of meaning and fulfillment in debating these topics however misguided he may be in his opinions. I know many couples who thrive on this sort of constant debating of topics. 

I think this point has implications for your relationship in that he's unlikely to ever be satisfied without the debates. It sounds like he already has outlets for debating with his colleagues and other friends. Despite this, he's still coming home and debating with you. This is clearly an important form of interaction to him within the context of your relationship.  

I don't say this to suggest you should indulge hm. Frankly, I want to toss myself down the stairs just from reading about these debates. Instead, I'd simply suggest you start thinking about how likely it that you'll be able to reduce these debates to a manageable number. While I like the suggestions of pointing him to other outlets, I get the sense that he sincerely wants to debate with you in addition to other people. Think about how you can find out if that's true and, if it is, how to manage that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry that you are in this situation and have to deal with his betrayal. I use that word because that's what he has done to you, regardless of what reason he may give for it. Alcohol, depression, loneliness - these are all just excuses, not reasons for you to overlook his behavior. Not only has he cheated on you, but he's done so on multiple occasions over an extended period of time. To me, that's a signal that no matter how much he may clean up his act in the short term, he'd be hard to trust in the long term. I think it's clear to all of us that you deserve and should seek out a man you can trust and seems on. 

As regards your family - if you don't tell them what happened, they are likely to draw their own conclusions once the break up becomes public. As hurt and sad as they may be, I think you should tell them the truth when you feel up to it.  What little you shared about them makes them sound like the sort of people who will have your back once they know what has happened. 

Also, remember that you have done nothing wrong here. You did your job...it was your boyfriend who did you wrong! You deserve the love and support of your family at a difficult time like this.

<TEXT> I assumed that had happened to you based on your reaction to things, though I didn't want to interject my assumptions into my initial response to you. With that said, you need to give some serious thought as to how you have dealt with past betrayals as I feel they may be coloring your current relationship and how you view yourself within it. 

I don't want to downplay your concerns about his relationship with this woman...it could be nothing, but it also could (as it always could) be something to worry about. There just has to be a better way to deal with his behavior (i.e. abandoning you without warning to spend an entire day drinking with this girl) than stewing and snooping. At the very least, he has been disrespectful and needed to (or needs to) apologize and make amends. After he does so, however, it's incumbent upon you to accept that and move past it. Wherever things have gone wrong, either with him showing sincere remorse or with you moving on, what matters now is that you focus on dealing with it in a way that leaves you satisfied. That may be a "you" issue or a "we" issue (I don't think it's a "him" issue, but perhaps I'm wrong there), but it's clearly some sort of issue.

<TEXT> There no need to apologize...you're entitled to focus on whichever replies you find helpful, though I'm glad you're reviewing them all just the same. 

It sounds like this might be an escalating pattern of behavior with him that helps explain your "overreaction" (I use quotes because I'm less convinced that it's an overreaction after reading your reply). It sounds like he occasionally does stupid things and refuses to take responsibility for them. Granted, it'd be pretty easy for someone to simply forget about the implications of having powered through all the hot dogs after a night of drinking. It's also be pretty easy for him, when confronted with his behavior, to say "I'm hung over and was drunk and forgot about the hot dogs. I'm sorry. I'll get more." 

Without passing judgment on your 
reaction, I'd simply suggest that you consider the broader implications of his behavior and whether there's anything for you to be concerned with going forward. It sounds like you're coming around to letting this go, but don't be so quick to think that there's nothing wrong here just because you may be overreacting. I hope that makes sense to you.  </TEXT>

It seemed to me like he was handing over the letter as if to say "Here it is regardless of what you say next" rather than trying to leverage the letter into a date. He probably should have waited a bit longer, but once the letter is written I don't see a problem with him asking for the date. There's basically nothing else he can do for her in a professional capacity at that point.  </TEXT>

Knowing that Gateway Drugs has sitar in their music, my best guess is that it's an electric sitar. They look a lot like guitars (some of them) but sound completely different. 

It would have sounded very...twangy, for lack of a better description. Does that sound like a possibility to you?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know how I've gotten to this point in my life. I'm dealing with the underlying emotional issues that have interfered with my efforts at weight loss for the last decade. I feel ready, finally, to tackle my weight once and for all. Thankfully, my general health is good and I have no mobility issues...I'm just morbidly obese and I can't go on this way. It's going to get worse if I don't heal myself here and now. I feel constantly tired and embarrassed about my appearance.

I can do this. I'm cutting out sugared beverages and focusing on tracking everything I eat using MFP.  I'm making sure I drink enough water. I'm working my way up from 20 minutes of walking per day to 60 in 5-minute increments over the next 8-12 weeks. I have my support system in place with friends, family, and partner. I'm here to add some accountability to my life and seek support. Thanks for listening and sharing your stories, Reddit. I'm reading them all! Let's do this!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why does being capable of taking on a challenge mean that challenge has to be financial? Frankly, taking up your parents on their offer could be viewed as a challenge because it gives you no excuse not to do your very best in your new job. Why don't you try redefining what it means to be independent in your own mind. Did you get your trainee position yourself? Did you pass through school yourself? Will you succeed professionally on your own merit? If these things are true, aren't you independently successful?

It sounds to me that you feel guilty about being privileged. This makes some sense, though not everyone feels this way about privilege. I agree with others who suggest you save your money and do something meaningful with it. I bet that would make you feel better than handing money over to some faceless landlord who is probably privileged too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our sex education class taught men about men's bodies and women about women's bodies. No overlap because it was a Catholic school. 

The first and only time I had sex with a woman (I'm gay), I tried sticking my penis in the wrong hole...had literally no clue there was a second, pee-dedicated hole down there. :-/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure what others will say, but this doesn't sound like an uncommon occurrence among PhD students in STEM fields. I've heard plenty of stories of doctoral students working crazy hours trying to get their work done. 60 hours was common in my own PhD program and mine is in Business, not a field where you work in a lab. My friends in physics and chemistry worked crazier hours than me, that's for sure. 

He's also working for an untenured researcher, which means that she is going to be riding him extra hard because her future literally depends on his success. The best bet here might be to inquire with other professors to see if he can find a new lab. As a second year student, he's probably doing coursework (if it's in the US) and he might be able to find someone in his area who can take him on and provide a more nurturing environment. If that's not a possibility, there probably isn't much to be done. Reporting her to a higher up is likely to backfire on some level - less attention could be just as deadly as more attention, frankly.  

The important thing to remember here is that PhD's are conferred, not earned. If she is going to supervise his dissertation, he needs her to be on his side. This means tolerating much more Crap than we might otherwise prefer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as I can tell, it's the 0 or 00 on Roulette. As each number has a 1/38 chance of being hit, you'll hit one 2.63% of the time. For standard baccarat with 8 decks, the possible combinations to win the Dragon 7 are around 112.6 trillion against 5.00 quadrillion total possible combinations. That means you can expect to hit the Dragon 7 2.25% of the time. 

You can determine the relative likelihood more easily, however, by simply looking at the payouts. A single number hit pays 35-1 at roulette versus 40-1 for the Dragon 7 bet. Based on that information alone, it's reasonable to conclude that the Dragon 7 has longer odds to occur relative to a single roulette number.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off...living with each other after so short a time dating? I know you used to see each other...how long have you been going out between the two periods of dating? 

I wouldn't usually condone looking at other people's text messages, but if it was really open and in plain sight then I don't see it as a violation for you to have looked at it and confronted him about it. 

Having confronted him and received what is essentially a deflecting non-response, it's difficult to see how you have much choice but to suspect the worst. If it was innocent, I would think he'd simply say so.  He's going to have to give you something to work with if there is any chance of salvaging things. Otherwise, you won't be able to trust him since you'll be suspecting the worst. 

I'd suggest talking to him again to try and get a real explanation out of him. If he's unwilling to talk or explain things, I'd take that as a sign that your relationship won't work out and act accordingly.  </TEXT>
