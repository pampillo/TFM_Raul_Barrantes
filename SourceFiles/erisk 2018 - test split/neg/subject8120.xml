You should also double check and make sure there are no underlying DNS issues, and quite possible have to recreate the DFS root. Like I said though, I just completely did away with DFS b/c it wasnt needed. That may not look to be plausible for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a Sophos UTM 9.411-3

I was going through firewall logs yesterday and noticed that traffic was still passing on a firewall entry I had disabled. I opened up the live log and it says its passing with a NAT rule. I was under the impression that you have to have the NAT rule plus firewall rule in place for traffic to pass. Is this not the case with Sophos?

edit1- So there has to be something somewhere other than the firewall rules allowing these NAT rules, as i've tested other rules and they look to be blocking fine when the rule is turned off. Any idea as to what else could allow traffic for https/http other than the firewall rule? </TEXT>

<TEXT> forwarders may be the same, but what about your forward lookup zones in DNS? Have you made sure that there is not a static zone for that website above that is pointing it to a certain IP? It's a reach, especially if this is all on the same domain...but worth looking at nonetheless.

Also, does this mean you cannot even resolve an IP whatsoever in your main location when using nslookup to these sites? The only other thing is maybe your public IP was blacklisted for some reason? </TEXT>

If i had to guess, its related to log files based on just a quick search of the error (MapiExceptionDatabaseError: Unable to mount database. (hr=0x80004005, ec=1108)

this article is for 2013 but has the same error https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/lync/en-US/6a30ff6d-9f7f-41c0-936b-6ac332cb9f8e/database-offline-unable-to-remount-exchange-2013?forum=exchangesvrgeneral

<TEXT> Unfortunately i cannot share the config.

This is a fairly simple setup as this is just a branch office. I have one netgear switch that has two ports VLAN 20. One port is going to a separate interface at 10.10.x.1/24 on the Fortigate, the other untagged port is going to a PC on the network. VLAN1 works fine at 10.20.x.1/24. I've done a flow diagnose and can see it reaching the firewall, but it does nothing with the packets. I can ping the gateway of VLAN1 and VLAN20 from the PC

These are the only things that come out of the fortigate diagnose

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello,

I've got a very weird issue that i'm wondering if someone could be of assistance. FGT60E

VLAN1 Primary 

VLAN20 

I have tried tagging the interface off of the internal interface as well as separating a different interface and having the interfaces untagged on the switch with PVID 20
I can get a DHCP from the firewall but cannot access the internet/primary VLAN (I have the policies in place where this should be allowed) Unless I create a policy based route to the internet for this interface it will not go to the internet. Even when i make a policy based route for VLAN20 I still cannot access VLAN1.

Also i can ping the gateway of the fortigate on both interfaces. It looks like something is just silently blocking all traffic from this interface I've tried turning on Asymetric routing as well to no avail. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Been dealing with WiFi issues for the past week. (I just implemented a  new fortigate solution) I had put together a Wifi Schedule so that the SSID would only broadcast from 730am to 5pm. Had complaints every morning and every after noon that the wifi was down. I had scoured all of the event logs, opened up a ticket with Fortigate tech support, and could not figure this out. I come in this morning and have an epiphany.... I look at the time zone of my Fortigate... Its 2 hours off due to the time zone.... So the SSID was not broadcasting until 930am and then disabling itself at 3pm... Needless to say, multiple facepalms occurred this morning... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Title,

Anyone else find that their web-filter has reclassified playboy.com to entertainment or something other than porn? I was testing my web-filter (and playboy is my goto to make sure its working) I assume since they no longer have photos up, its being reclassified. I did a manual reclassification, but just curious if any other web filters are doing the same. </TEXT>

Just a quick update in case anyone else reads this and doesn't want to go through the disabling SMB2 route.
adding/setting this registry edit on the clients fixed the issue for us

I've tried turning off hardware acceleration via GPO with no success. Much appreciated if anyone has any ideas since i've been pounding my head on this since Monday.

EDIT: if anyone runs into this thread while searching for an answer, Looks like one of the April 2016 updates to Office nuked Outlook and Lync on Remote Desktop. I've uninstalled Office and Reinstalled but am holding off on patching office for awhile. My issues are fixed. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ran into this today. Got fix from Microsoft. Could be affecting alot of networks.

Hi Everyone,

Recently weve received several reports on two related issues for Office 2013 apps. If your Office installation is MSI-based version 15.0.4787.1001, or Click-to-Run version 15.0.4787.1002, you may get the errors below.  
1. System Error - The program cant start because davclnt.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem. - Primary thread
2. "Sorry, something went wrong while trying to obtain a shared computer license for XXX, Error Code: 0xc004f014 "  Primary thread
  
We are working on a fix for the issue (No ETA on this). Before the fix is ready, please install the Desktop Experience feature as a workaround. See this article for information about installing the Desktop Experience.We will provide an update at the primary threads above once the fix is released. You can subscribed to the threads to get the most recent information.

If you are experiencing a similar issue with a different error message, please let us know by starting a new thread as this may indicate either a scoping issue or an independent problem.

<TEXT> I'm about to restore this server from backup, but just curious if anyone else has seen this. 

Basically I have a server that is in VMware. From the console of this server I can ping external and internal devices. No problem. However I can't seem to accept connections to this server. Ex ping and RDP don't work. ( Windows firewall is definitely turned off)

I've tried recreating the nic in VMware. Resetting the ip stack as well as changing the ip itself on the server.  
I've never seen anything like it. Google searches all say it's Windows firewall related but I've triple checked this. All zones are turned off. I also do not have any 3rd party software firewalls installed. I'd also like to note that this server was working fine a week ago with no changes. ( it is running Forefront in a dmz) I've checked the settings there as well nothing has changed. I've even tried putting the server on the local lan and turning off all forefront services to no avail. 

Tldr: server can access all things but all things can't access server.  </TEXT>

Defense has more swagger so far ( not been trashed on yet) mariota hasn't thrown pick but also has not been perfect sailing some balls only a matter of time until first int comes. Going to be a rough year running the ball it looks like. Sankey pulling ahead as lead back through 6 days of training camp. WR corps are huge. Now if only they can catch the ball. Green-Beckham looks like a beast but probably won't contribute much for at least until last half of season.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey all,

I was having a hard time getting the X1 controller to recognize in a windows 10 VM

Error message i would get would say there was not a Xbox controller connected on trying to stream even though the controller was showing in device manager...

the fix is to go into the VM settings and change the usb controller operation from USB 3.0 to 2.0

<TEXT> NFL.com Standard scoring 12 Team

After initial waivers cleared this week Percy Harvin and Jonathan Stewart were dropped..

Which one should have higher waiver priority for me? I'm sure i'll get sniped out of one of them since i'm pretty low on the waiver chain but you never know..

Rest of Roster:

* QB: Nick Foles/Tom Brady
* RB: Matt Forte/LeSean McCoy/Brandon Oliver/CJ Spiller/James White
* WR: Dez/Kelvin/Justin Hunter/Gordon
* TE: Cameron

Note: Planning on dropping James White after NE game if I don't see any usage from him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah you'll be hurting at WR. Patterson has fell off the fantasy radar without AP. I'd look at grabbing a WR off waivers today as a result of this trade. Malcolm Floyd, Jordan Matthews, Brian quick, and either Allen hurns or Allen Robinson are some names that should be available in most leagues. The good thing is that WR is the easiest position to replace :) </TEXT>

Little incentive for commissioners is that you get a 25 dollar gift card in addition to the room for your league. 

They just opened up sign ups for dates last week and I've scheduled mine already.. Hope this helps someone.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dmz is not a great idea... You need to set your xbox to a static IP. Then port forward the ports in this link http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/network-ports-used-xbox-live to the IP that you set. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would talk to campus IT for sure... it sucks b/c you will probably never have an "open NAT" for xbox live.

Probably not possible since they have it locked down but these ports should be opened as well.
Xbox Live requires the following ports to be open:

Port 88 (UDP)
Port 3074 (UDP and TCP)
Port 53 (UDP and TCP)
Port 80 (TCP)
Port 500 (UDP)
UDP Port 3544 (UDP)
UDP Port 4500 (UDP) </TEXT>

Not bad, I would of taken a few players before Rice. WR is fine. RB is fine. QB is fine. You will most likely make the playoffs as long as something doesn't go wrong. </TEXT>

I ended up going to see a therapist and havent had one since. He taught me some breathing techniques.. But i'm not sure that you are having panic attacks right?

anyway here is a link to some breathing techniques that he gave me. (it's acutally him doing this) http://www.hillcounseling.com/DeepBreathing.mp3

(im 27/male/6'2/192 pounds) btw so you are not alone. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is this anxiety causing this? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I haven't posted in awhile here, mainly because i've stopped having my panic attacks that I used to. I just wanted some opinions on something though. I have had a chronic shoulder pain for over a year now. Some background (i play softball and through with this arm too.) The pain/tension that i have radiates from the back of my shoulder blade to under my armpit to my collar bone. Sometimes I do not notice these pains. If I run or exercise I feel good for awhile but it always comes back. I still have a higher level of stress but i'm haven't had a full blown panic attack in almost 4 months now. (I have had xray's done on my shoulder and found nothing) I think the biggest concern is that i have some sort of cancer there (i don't know why)

In short... Could this pain in my shoulder be caused by anxiety or should I get this checked out by a doctor and go get an MRI?

I just want the opinions of others on this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ativan will only help with the short term effects (panic attack) it's not to be used for daily medication, in fact doctors will not let you stay on it because of the addicting affect it has on people. Not saying this won't help but it's not a long term solution. Antidepressants will probably be more effective in the long term if you are intent on taking drugs.

<TEXT> This guy has the right answer. Also running eases stress too. I have the same issues always worried about my shoulder and if I have cancer in it when in all likelyhood ive just hurt it playing baseball with a rotator cuff injury. But ive came to the realization that my shoulder doesnt hurt when I dont think about it and when I exercise I feel great.. ive been on the fence for awhile about going to the doctor to get a mri or something on it for over a year now. But keep having these moments where it just goes away for awhile and then I change my mind.. I can say that ive been without a panic attack for over 4 months now. I always felt crappy on meds and decoded I didnt want to be dependent on a substance. </TEXT>

My take on the consoles is this. (in a very brief format)

* If you only play single player get a PS4 </TEXT>

I hope thats right... It takes it there for me..

You can also find it under the draft central tab when logged in.

Edit.. that link probably will not work since it's tied to my league number.... But you should still be able to get to it from the Draft Central tab. (you will see mock drafts under it.) </TEXT>

When the league starts the person with the 12th pick has #1 waiver and so on..

<TEXT> Also, When you have a panic attack, your body sends all of your blood away from your extremities and into your core. My therapist told me it's because of the fight of flight symptom and when it does that it's bracing for an injury and most of your major organs are in your core area and your body wants to protect these at all costs thus the feeling of cold extremities and sometimes numbness while this is happening. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had the same symptoms...

Make sure you cut out caffeine and limit your sugar intake... especially before bed.

When you wake up like that.. don't just lay there. Get up and do something for a few minutes... I know from experience that if you just lay there it will get worse. 

Try some breathing exercises next time you feel your heart pounding like that.... Breathe from your stomach and take deep breaths.. also through in one or two breaths where you hold your breath for a couple of seconds and slowly exhale.. It has a really great calming effect. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel i need to share this...

I found the panic away pdf from here http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/10y4nt/panic_away_program/ that was posted awhiile ago...

I'm not sure what happened but as soon as I read this and followed what it said (Basically letting the panic attack happen and not fighting it, observe and tell it you want more)

I was having attacks almost everyday.. Now with not being afraid.. (and I've started exercising..) I haven't had one in almost a month now...

I highly recommend everyone read that or buy the actual program.. Just by reading this for 10 min it has saved me from what was becoming a debilitating ordeal.

Thanks for everyone that supports people on this subbreddit as well it really is a great therapy. </TEXT>

It's already hard enough to make it across the maps to even pick up the flag, now it's almost impossible to capture once taken b/c of this BS

<TEXT> So doctors tell me that I have general anxiety... But mainly its hypochondria I have started having tightness in my left side of my chest up near my collar bone and shoulder plus in my back I have popping with pain whenever I move in certain positions. Would anxiety cause this by tensing of muscles in these areas? Basically my worst fear is I have some sort of tumor etc.. But I've had multiple X-rays and nothing shows up... So now I've been having panic attacks more frequently bc I cannot stop thinking about my issues... Can anyone relate to this? </TEXT>
