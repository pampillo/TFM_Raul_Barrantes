<TEXT> Hmm well everything was kind of made separately. I gave the seasonings for the potatoes in another response but for everything else: The beans were just seasoned with some onion powder, garlic powder, and some lime juice. The salsa (tomatoes, green onions, cilantro) had a jalapeo, a clove or two of garlic (minced), some cayenne pepper, salt, cumin, black pepper, and lime juice. The rice was a bit more complicated. I sauted a couple cloves of garlic and 2 jalapeos that had both been minced and then added a mixture of 2-3 tomatoes and one onion that had both been pured together, and then 2 cups of veggie stock (however chicken stock is more traditional and if you don't have any dietary restrictions, you would probably get a more authentic flavor with chicken stock). I seasoned the liquid mixture with salt and pepper to taste, and then, in a separate pan, added about 4 tablespoons of canola oil and added 2 cups of white rice that I rinsed for a couple minutes (til the water run clears to get rid of the starch so the rice doesn't clump up while cooking). I fried the rice for about 5 to 7 minutes and then added the liquids to it, brought it to a boil, and then turned down the heat to let it simmer. I let it sit until the rice had taken in all of the liquid which was about 30 minutes. Then I added some chopped cilantro and another diced jalapeo and mixed it all together! And that's about it. Please feel free to let me know if any of that needs clarification!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> No problem! I'm kind of in the same boat haha. I decided to go vegan a couple months ago (from being an omni) and that was fine and easy while I was living on campus and eating whatever veggies the caf was serving and so coming back home has meant trying to diversify my palate, which has been a bit of a challenge, but a very fun one! It definitely helps that I'm 17 and jobless and thus have a ton of free time on my hands though. Good luck with your future dishes!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Haha I just tossed in a ton of stuff that was in my cupboard. From what I can remember there was: paprika, lemon pepper, garlic salt, onion powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and some sriracha seasoning. And I had tossed them in olive oil beforehand. I also read somewhere that letting the potatoes sit in water for an hour to two before baking them helps remove some starch and makes for crispier potatoes so that's always worth a try! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was going for more of a "well shoot, but on the bright side..!" kind of tone. Definitely did not mean to come off as butt hurt at all. Also I meant that I've ordered pho cooked with specifically seafood stock at Vietnamese restaurants. Not arguing that traditional pho isn't made with beef stock but I have gotten some made without beef that was still labeled as pho </TEXT>

<TEXT> Guess it's not technically pho then since I used veggie stock but that's cool cuz it was still delicious \_()_/ I see pho made with seafood stock all the time though so I'm not sure how well that logic holds  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually went around online and combined different things to make something suitable to my preference!   

For the broth, I used a couple star anises, a few whole cloves, a bay leaf, a couple sticks of cinnamon (which may be overpowering if you're not a fan of cinnamon, it miiight be better to stick to one), a big ol' onion which I charred beforehand, a small piece of ginger which was also charred, a clove or two of sliced garlic a couple tablespoons of soy sauce, some crushed red pepper, 4 cups of water, and 4 cups of stock (vegetable stock was used in my case). I toasted the cloves, anise, cinnamon, and bay leaf in the soup pot for a few minutes before tossing in everything else, and then I just brought everything to a boil and then reduced the heat to let them simmer for a couple of hours (you probably don't need more than an hour but I was keeping myself busy and wasn't in a rush so I was fine with letting them sit). Then just add salt or some more soy sauce to taste afterwards if you feel it's necessary! 

Edit: Removed link, listed the ingredients that I used. Feel free to PM me for the original reference!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> quick follow up question! have you ever tried using chia eggs for baking? from what i've seen online, they seem to be pretty interchangeable and chia seeds seem to have more uses and can be bought and stored while ground so i'm kinda leaning towards chia seeds but again, i'm not sure exactly how that'd work out in baked goods. especially since all the comments have been choosing flax eggs over chia seed ones </TEXT>
