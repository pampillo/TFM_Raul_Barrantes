<TEXT> Sorry to be that guy, but this is improper use of the word "deadly," which is used to describe something capable of inflicting damage. Weapons are deadly. Venom is deadly. A martial artist can be described as deadly.  Calling Mexico deadly makes it sound like it has a powerful military.  The word they are looking for is "dangerous" or "perilous" </TEXT>

<TEXT> "The comments seem to be posted by different people, with their addresses attached. But people contacted by The Verge said they did not write the comments and have no idea where the posts came from.

That doesnt even sound like verbiage I would use, says Nancy Colombo of Connecticut, whose name and address appeared alongside the comment.

I have no idea where that came from, says Lynn Vesely, whose Indiana address also appeared, and who was surprised to hear about the comment." </TEXT>

<TEXT> My departmental focus is actually on gene editing, and I'd have to disagree with you. My current research is focused on using CRISPR to correct congenital diseases in dogs. Previously I worked with engineering mouse disease models. To me, genetic engineering is a great benefit to humanity.  I just think a lot of the fear comes from laypeople not understanding the science.  </TEXT>

I once thought Wikileaks was a neutral party, but it now it smells like even they have their own agenda.  It's enough to make me throw my hands in the air and want to give up.  Where do we turn to for the truth?  Or does it not exist anymore in this day and age?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Chinese speaker here.  There are many ways to alter spoken inflection without altering tone, such as rhythm, volume, consonant vs vowel emphasis, etc.  Also, in Chinese, tones are relative to the beginning and end of a syllable, not absolute.  For example, "second tone" is where the syllable starts low and ends high.  If I raise the entire syllable higher, it is still "second tone" because the relative position of the beginning and end of the syllable are maintained. In this manner, I can make a particular word higher in pitch relative to other words, but that word itself still carries the same relative tone when comparing the beginning and end of the syllable.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> This guy is right to be skeptical of these claims.  Going from 20% degradation to 5% degradation is a huge leap.  I've worked in materials science, advancement doesn't usually happen that fast.  There is a legit argument though that the technology was already available, and it was more of a cost/benefit issue for putting it into cell phones.   </TEXT>

Exhibit C: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8bfBlxVnPU feature=youtu.be t=33s

What's going on here? Is this something every character has and I've just never noticed?  I've already figured out it's not due to air vs ground, as you can clearly hear the same inflection used for both air and ground versions.  I actually think it's a stage-specific thing, because the way she says "tatami gaeshi" sounds the same for the entire duration of a match, but it sounds different across different matches.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I preordered the galaxy s8. However, I changed my mind and want the S8+ instead.  AT T won't let me cancel the order, but they'll let me bring it back for a refund and then I can get an S8+.  What I'm worried about is, since my S8+ isn't technically a preorder then, will I lose my free samsung VR?  Is there a way I can redeem the gift using my original order? What do I have to actually do to redeem the gift?  Do I have to cut out and send a UPC or something like that?    </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-04-01 21:57:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> On one hand, you have super hard materials like diamond that are unscratchable, but would probably make a brittle phone screen.  On the other hand, you have materials like plastic that basically can't shatter, but scratch easily.  Nowadays we have materials like gorilla glass that try to find a good middle ground.  My question: is it theoretically possible to have the best of both worlds, given unlimited budget?  A material as scratch-proof as diamond, but as shatter-proof as plastic? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am deeply sorry about your situation, but at least you can take some comfort knowing that you are teaching a valuable lesson to all closet atheists.  The message is clear: DO NOT COME OUT until you are financially independent.  DO NOT let emotions get the better of you.  No matter how much it pains you, keep up the act, pretend to be the good Muslim/Christian or whatever, do anything to appear religious.  Patience patience patience.  One day, you will be freed from these shackles, but the path to freedom takes discipline, planning, and courage.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hair grows from hair follicles. Repeated plucking can damage or kill the follicle, thus stopping hair growth. However, these cells can be repopulated from stem cells that reside in the hair follicle niche.   

This is speculation, but the hair follicles in the middle of your forehead could have more of these stem cells.  One type of stem cell in the hair follicle is derived from a cell population called the Neural Crest.  During embryonic development, these cells migrate from your spinal area and wrap around you until they meet at the front of your body.  The area where these cells converge could have a higher density of these special stem cells.  This might explain why the center of your face is more resilient to plucking.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think you are addressing my question, as I already understand what all the conjugations mean.

But I never hear



This is strange to me because I would think that grammatically both can be used for first and second person.  Why is there a bias for  to be used more frequently in second person?  I would prefer if a native speaker could comment on this. 

Edit: modified for clarity. I am not asking for a lesson explaining the difference between  form and  form, I already know this.  This is a question about speaking idioms, not grammar.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> He says it's illegal to possess technically.  But I decided to read up on this, and I'll concede the point that the legality of possessing these documents is still unclear, based on this: http://lawnewz.com/high-profile/law-prof-smacks-down-cnn-chris-cuomos-claim-that-its-illegal-to-possess-wikileaks-emails/

So in fact CNN might have messed up here, but it is also a matter of debate. They may have overstepped the line by being so confident with that statement.  But I really don't think this is at all equivalent to "fake news" which is literally making up an event to fool everyone.

Remember that story about hundreds of thousands of hillary votes found in a dumpster? Made up by one guy who ran a fake news website to make money.

Coca Cola, for example. Do you think the guys who created Coke and did all the heavy lifting with marketing and distribution back in the day would agree with the SJW Coke commercials for a moment?
Hell no, they wouldn't. But the Left gets its tentacles over a product and then uses it to shove their shitty agenda down our throats.
It's really starting to get to me.

Or maybe people smart enough to run tech companies are just usually liberal </TEXT>

<TEXT> The free market is great for many things, but if there's something it's TERRIBLE at is serving the minority.  If you are one of only a few vegetarians in your town, good luck waiting for the free market to produce a vegetarian restaurant in that town.  It's the same for sexual orientation.  If you live in San Francisco where there is a large gay population, you might be fine.  But if you live in a small, conservative, highly religious rural town?  If not for laws against discrimination, you'd probably have to move out. 

You say that my hypothetical situation is unlikely, but for a large part of American history it was the reality.  Prior to the civil rights movement, in many states, black people were treated as second class citizens. Where was the free market to come along and help them?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> But a bakery doesn't have the right to refuse whoever they want; by law they cannot discriminate on the basis of race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation.  Imagine if everyone were allowed to do this.  Imagine being gay and no wedding venues being willing to host you.  Imagine taxi drivers refusing service to black people.  Imagine restaurants that said "No catholics allowed." Is that the world you want to live in?  Maybe you'd say yes, you wouldn't mind that kind of world because then business owners would be "free." But that sort of freedom comes at a heavy cost, creating a hostile environment where the minority will always suffer at the hands of the majority.  

I guess it comes down to this: what is worse to you?  People being forced to provide goods and services to those they hate?  Or people not being able to obtain goods and services from those they are hated by? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Blitz Attack, Guilty Gears version of the Focus Attack, has also been significantly changed. It allows players to go into a stance that allows them to soak up one hit before attacking. Unfortunately, Guilty Gear is a very offensive game and there was little use for this defensive maneuver. So Rev2 is going to change it to be a more offensive tool.
While originally players could only use this technique while in neutral, now they can cancel into it from normals. The first thing this change does is create new combo paths into characters Blitz Attacks. But the more significant thing this change does is turn the Blitz Attack into a sort of counter breaker. Now, if you think the opponent is going to somehow punish you from a defensive stance, you can use the Blitz Attack to bait it.

Very interesting </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sure some of you have experienced this.  Microsoft IME has had this annoying bug for more than a decade.  It won't let you make hiragana the default input method when you switch to Japanese.  It always starts as romaji, and then you have to hit alt+tilde to make it type hiragana.  That means every time I wanna type Japanese, I gotta press windows + spacebar to swap to Japanese language, and then alt+tilde to go to hiragana.  Very annoying and inefficient.  Is there an alternative less annoying way to go about this? </TEXT>

According to Daniel Bloodworth from Easy Allies, although Nintendo let people try out various game demos, nobody got to see the actual system UI. This leads me to believe that the UI is not yet in a presentable state, which may be why they haven't shown anything related to the touchscreen.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dear Arc System Works,

In Revelator, why is it not possible to map player 2 buttons on keyboard, without using a third-party button remapper and gamepad emulator? Why can't I play using keyboard for one player and stick for the other? Why am I forced to use buggy third-party workarounds so I can play the way I like?  It was fine in SIGN, so why can't they get it right with Revelator?  Please, PLEASE fix this issue in Rev 2!  

Sincerely,

<TITLE> CMV: Animated and illustrated child pornography should be legal </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-13 02:57:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I believe that animated and illustrated depictions of underage sex (i.e. hentai) should be legal. My reasons are as follows:

1. Unlike real child porn, animated child porn is a victim-less crime. No real children are harmed in its creation or consumption.

2.  There is no academically-accepted evidence that the viewing of animated child porn increases sexual deviancy or other criminal tendencies. 

3.  It provides an outlet for pedophiles, preventing would-be predators from committing sexual acts on real children.  

4.  It is often difficult to ascertain the age of drawn characters like those in anime or manga. They may possess child-like features such as big eyes or flat chest, while being actually over 18 years of age.

5.  Prohibiting the drawing of taboo subjects is tantamount to censorship.

Give me your best reasons why illustrated or drawn child pornography should be prohibited.  

Edit: To those threatening me or calling me disgusting: grow up.  I'm not personally interested in child porn, animated or otherwise.  I just think it should be legal.

I do think that if there was sufficient competition from various ISPs, zero-rating could be a good thing, because then the customer has the choice to use the ISP with the best zero-rated content.

<DATE> 2017-01-12 02:12:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just one year ago, it seemed like net neutrality scored a serious win when the FCC redefined ISPs as common carriers and imposed new rules to safeguard the open internet. Fast forward to today, and net neutrality is in dire straits.  The Trump administration will likely kill the neutrality rules, Tom Wheeler is going to step down, Ajit Pai will be in charge, and it seems to me like the open internet as we know it will all but evaporate.  Many ISPs now engage in zero-rating schemes, creating an unfair advantage by making their own content free. Worsening the situation, the deployment of meaningful competition has been obstructed time and time again, with AT T and Comcast threatening to sue townships that try to build out their own municipal broadband ISPs or introduce Google Fiber. In short, the internet is going to hell, big ISPs are having a field day, and I feel utterly powerless to stop it.  Are companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT T truly this.evil?  Can someone please change my view so that I can have at least a glimmer of hope for the next four years?  

Edit:
Thanks for the responses.  I'm not really asking for an explanation of how companies have a right to make money; I fully understand the concept of fiduciary duty.  What I'm asking for is an explanation of how this action might not be as anti-consumer as I believe.  Tell me how the actions of these companies could actually BENEFIT consumers, like they've claimed countless times in press releases.  Convince me that I should be supportive of AT T, Verizon, and Comcast instead of reviling them    </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am trying raise awareness of maphacking and expose these guys who are ruining the game for the rest of us. Though it isn't as rampant as the hots days, maphacking is still alive and well; there are still forums of people sharing private and for-pay maphacks on sites like this:  

http://www.d3scene.com/forum/starcraft-2-hacks/

Here is one guy who claims to have a working one:
http://www.d3scene.com/forum/starcraft-2-hacks/113289-warning-i-am-trying-make-sc2-map-hack.html

I don't know if there is any legal recourse for Blizzard to shut this down.  But at least these guys should be exposed and Blizzard needs to be aware of the situation.

<TEXT> The idea is to completely remove the delay between blinking and attacking, so that the DT instantly blinks and deals damage without waiting for the attack animation.  It's essentially the same as the LOTV chargelot buff, which made the charge itself deal some damage.  The high damage is so this can be used to assassinate high HP units quickly, sort of like a snipe.  Finally, this is balanced by the requirement of a target unit to blink to, which further serves to differentiate this ability from stalker blink.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's my idea.  Replace Shadow Stride with Shadow Strike.  5 range cast on a single enemy unit.  DT then blinks to the unit and deals 90 damage.  This can be utilized to negate the range advantage after DTs get scanned, or can be used to quickly assassinate high priority targets in large battles.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reading the first link you posted, I found this argument very dubious:
Technology has advanced to the point that photographs of real children being abused can
be manipulated into cartoons or other depictions. Possession of these images is not caught
under existing legislation because they do not appear to be photographs, nor can the police
forfeit them and take them out of circulation. But nevertheless they are often graphic and
explicit depictions of the sexual abuse of children. 

It sounds like they are saying that cartoons can be derived from modified real images, which to me just sounds utterly ridiculous

<TEXT> I've played fighting games casually for a long time, but never got particularly good at them.  Whether it be SF4, UMVC3, or KOF13, I always get my butt handed to me online. I'm looking to play a more modern fighting game now, and guilty gear is by far the most impressive current generation game.  I love the idea of the roman cancel system and the graphics are absolutely stunning.  However, it seems to have a steep learning curve, and I unfortunately do not have as much time any more to commit.  Is it worth buying this game if I don't have the time to train consistently?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like the void ray reversion. I think prismatic beams in WoL was one of the most interesting game mechanics, and it's sad it was replaced with something as simple as "press button, lazers stronger!" If protoss players are concerned with the damage output, they could add an upgrade that increases the void ray chargeup speed by like 30% or something.  Seems perfectly reasonable with the proper tweaking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are couple ways to address burrowfestors without outright reverting:

1. Greatly reduce vision while burrowed.  Zerg players would need to utilize spotters to optimally land fungals, or unburrow temporarily for better vision.  

2. Reduce movement speed even more while burrowed. This is the simpler nerf, as infestors right now may be too mobile even when burrowed.   

Either of these would be more interesting IMO than reverting the changes.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Cyclone Anti-Air Redesign </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-12 20:46:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The current cyclone is in an awkward position right now, possessing a decent anti-armor ground attack but a laughably weak anti-air attack, possible the weakest anti-air in the game. However, straight buffing the AA would make the cyclone too well-rounded off the bat. To make the unit more mechanically and aesthetically unified, I suggest the following:

1.  Make Lock-on use the same weapon as the ground attack, just shoot up. This would be more aesthetically consistent with the concept of the cyclone (think WWII-era AA flak cannons).  
2.  Cyclone can move while locked-on, but movement speed is reduced. This is to prevent the cyclone from being overly powerful against air offensively, while keeping it strong defensively.    
3.  Lock-on requires a research upgrade called "Advanced Targeting."  The tier that unlocks this upgrade can be arbitrarily adjusted to balance.  

This way, cyclone starts off as a limited ground attack unit, but can be upgraded to have decent AA.  I also personally think cyclone shouldn't be an anti-armor specialist, but should do the same damage across the board (something like 4 dmg).

<TEXT> While I acknowledge that many media outlets have a strong liberal bias in their reporting, they are a far cry from outright "fake" news.  Fake news refers to fabrications and hoaxes created solely to deceive readers. These are completely made-up stories with no grounding in reality whatsoever. Examples include specific anecdotes of rape perpetrated by Muslims that actually never happened, just to stir up anti-Muslim sentiment. To conflate these sorts of hoaxes with what the mainstream media engages in--which admittedly can be very biased at times--only further obscures the truth and sets a very dangerous precedent for objective journalism.  I'm not saying that the mainstream media is infallible, but there is a big difference between selective reporting and outright lies.    </TEXT>

But seriously, when you are in the lower middle class working long hours and barely eeking out a living, unable to pay for a good education, unable to afford the prescription drugs you need, the last thing you are concerned about is race politics.

<TEXT> The unit certainly has issues, but the new high ROF archetype fulfills a fantasy not seen in any other unit in SC2.  Balance and mechanics are important, but aesthetics and "feel" are also essential to creating an iconic unit. The old cyclone fired missiles that are basically indistinguishable from any number of other terran projectiles: marauder, viking, thor AA, widow mine, etc.  At least VISUALLY the new cyclone is very distinctive and exciting to look at, if not to use. This alone makes me hesitate from scrapping the design.  

I just think they could tweak the numbers a bit, and let the unit fire while moving to help with kiting. Think rapid-fire, ground-based Phoenix that could dance around slower armored units.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Battlecruiser energy suggestion </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-26 22:03:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I like the intention behind putting tactical jump and yamato cannon on independent timers, which allows the abilities to be used in quick succession.  However, once terran has 3-4 battlecruisers, he can essentially just scan and snipe down any building at will every 71 seconds, with zero risk or chance of counter play.  

Instead of the two timers, can we revert back to energy, but have both abilities cost 100 energy?  That way, a battlecruiser at full 200 energy can still perform both abilities consecutively, but at least it can be countered by EMP or feedback.  Additionally, it provides more flexibility, since the player can choose between double yamato cannon, double tactical jump, or a combination of the two. I think this is a more elegant implementation with the same benefits, but offers some chance of counter play.    </TEXT>

<TITLE> Ravens in 3.8 are simply too strong </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-26 21:54:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yes, Ravens have been seeing less play since the release of LOTV. But in the attempt to bring them back into meta, patch 3.8 takes things way too far.  In its current form, massing ravens and pushing out with autoturret spam is way more efficient and versatile than it should be. Maybe you could argue that one should never allow terran to amass that many ravens, but with the siege tank buffs, terran has an easier time turtling than before.  

I'm not arguing for weakening the raven. I believe units must be effective to be worthwhile at all. But the energy cost of the abilities should be increased so that it cannot be spammed as easily.  Seeker missile should cost 100 energy instead of 75, and turrets should cost 75 energy instead of 50.  What do you guys think about the current Raven? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Witcher 3 PC: can you bind the same key to multiple actions? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-16 22:19:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In the default key bindings, left shift is context sensitive--it is used for both sprinting and for modifying attacks.  However, I cannot remap both of these actions to a different key.  For example, if I try to bind sprint to Alt, and then try to bind modify attack also to the Alt key, it will clear the sprint key binding.  It seems as though only the default key bindings allow for multiple actions to be bound to the same key.  Is there any way around this? Any insight would be appreciated.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys.  So I played the Witcher 3 for about a month when it first came out on PC.  Now I am considering getting back into it.  I've heard that with all the patches, the game has changed considerably, including things like the user interface, sign balancing, and quests. For example, I heard the Igni sign was heavily nerfed. It is nearly impossible for me to dig through the patch notes of all the updates, each with hundreds of bullet points.  Would you guys be able to explain some of the biggest differences between the game when it was originally released, versus the game in its current state? Would very much appreciate it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I implore you all: no matter how cool a trailer looks, no matter how promising previews and demos appear, please, PLEASE do not preorder games. Preordering rewards publishers that overhype games, leading to situations like No Man's Sky selling millions despite terrible reviews from both players and critics. Publishers are actively discouraging players from making informed purchases--more and more publishers refuse to send early reviewer copies, for fear that negative press will kill early sales.  Don't let these companies prey on consumer impatience. Wait for the game to release, see if it's any good, and THEN make an informed choice to buy the game. What's the harm?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Past performance doesn't always ensure quality.  Square Enix has made divisive games before. And FFXV being in development longer than NMS doesn't mean much, when you consider games like Duke Nukem Forever being in development for 15 years and still being terrible. Really, the only point of preordering is to get the game slightly earlier than others. I just feel waiting that extra couple days  to evaluate a game's quality is more valuable than being among the first to play.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> there are no reviews out. some outlets were permitted to play the first five chapters, on the condition that they explicitly can't call it a "review" and to only give rough impressions.  previews are always more positive than reviews, so we will see what the final verdict looks like upon release.

Edit: I don't see why I'm being downvoted for stating an objective fact </TEXT>

<TEXT> nothing personal, but could I kindly persuade you not to preorder?  Preordering is encouraging game developers to churn out mediocre games and diverting development resources into marketing and hype. No Man's Sky sold millions of units through preorders before everyone realized it was essentially a scam.  Wait for the game to come out, see if it is any good, and THEN buy it.  What do you have to lose?

Edit: really? downvotes?  I'm making a perfectly reasonable and sound argument... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think total annihilation was a fantastic game that really nailed physics-based large scale RTS.  It was way ahead of its time, and it  still impresses me today. Yes, it sacrificed precise micromanagement for slower-paced overall strategy, but I just feel Blizzard has the capability of defining a new kind of RTS that marries elements of both sides.  Let's not be so defeatist.  

I actually think Supreme Commander 2 already achieved great strides in streamlining gameplay while maintaining it's sense of scale.  IMO, the main issues with the Supreme Commander series are storytelling and developer commitment to competitive play. And these are precisely the two components Blizzard excels at.  Think of the possibilities.

Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You're a plague and we are the cure.

<TEXT> In 1980, the IHR promised a $50,000 reward to anyone who could prove that Jews were gassed at Auschwitz. Mel Mermelstein wrote a letter to the editors of the LA Times and others including The Jerusalem Post. The IHR wrote back, offering him $50,000 for proof that Jews were, in fact, gassed in the gas chambers at Auschwitz. Mermelstein, in turn, submitted a notarized account of his internment at Auschwitz and how he witnessed Nazi guards ushering his mother and two sisters and others towards (as he learned later) gas chamber number five. Despite this, the IHR refused to pay the reward. Represented by public interest attorney William John Cox, Mermelstein subsequently sued the IHR in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County for breach of contract, anticipatory repudiation, libel, injurious denial of established fact, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and declaratory relief (see case no. C 356 542). On October 9, 1981, both parties in the Mermelstein case filed motions for summary judgment in consideration of which Judge Thomas T. Johnson of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County took "judicial notice of the fact that Jews were gassed to death at the Auschwitz Concentration Camp in Poland during the summer of 1944,"[49][50] judicial notice meaning that the court treated the gas chambers as common knowledge, and therefore did not require evidence that the gas chambers existed. On August 5, 1985, Judge Robert A. Wenke entered a judgment based upon the Stipulation for Entry of Judgment agreed upon by the parties on July 22, 1985. The judgment required IHR and other defendants to pay $90,000 to Mermelstein and to issue a letter of apology to "Mr. Mel Mermelstein, a survivor of Auschwitz-Birkenau and Buchenwald, and all other survivors of Auschwitz" for "pain, anguish and suffering" caused to them.[50] </TEXT>

<TITLE> Balance map suggestion: remove MSC, make all protoss buildings (including photon cannons and pylons) chronoboostable </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-21 08:09:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know it sounds drastic, but please bear with me.  Since David Kim is entertaining the idea of radical changes, I thought I'd throw out an idea I've been toying with for a while.  A lot of players dislike the MSC and pylon overcharge.  But if MSC is removed, there needs to be a compensatory buff, or else Protoss cannot survive the early game.  

What if instead of MSC, chronoboost had a lot more utility than just an economic boost?  What if it could be applied to photon cannons to increase its rate of fire, or applied to pylons to increase the speed of warp-ins?  Yes, there is potential for cannon rush abuse, but expending the chronoboost on cannons necessarily comes at the expense of one's economy, such that I think it could be balanced.  Also, the cooldown of switching the chronoboosted building could be adjusted to further tweak the balance.  For example, if you devote your chronoboost for cannon cheese, but your cannon gets taken out, then the chronoboost becomes unavailable to switch to another building for a time. 

I think this change could potentially add a lot of strategic depth to Protoss play. Any thoughts?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The ground attack is only 5 damage stronger than the air attack, and given its slow rate of fire, this buff is basically meaningless.  Also, Queens' and Thors' attacks look visually distinct, and neither have a range discrepancy of 9! That's just ridiculous to me

<TITLE> I find the new tempest really confusing? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-16 22:08:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I love most of the changes, and I understand the intent behind the new tempest, but the huge discrepancy in range between the air and ground attack is really aesthetically uncomfortable.  Air attack is 15 range, but ground attack is 6?  That's an entire thermal lance difference in range!  For two attacks that are visually identical, this just feels really awkward and unintuitive.  

I'd rather remove the ground attack entirely than have a 6 range attack that does nearly no damage. The ground attack is basically like the sentinel at this point--while it technically can attack, it is totally irrelevant.  

Shouldn't the two attacks be the same range, and the new ability have the short range?  If we're worried about tempests being OP, you can make both air and ground attacks have slightly shorter range, like 11-13, and still have it accomplish the role of long-range siege. That would make a lot more sense to me... am I the only one who feels this way?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really like most of the changes but I agree the tempest ability needs tweaking.  I propose that they keep the ground attack range the same as the air range, and instead make the disruption sphere 6 range.  This way, the tempest still has a consistent role as long-range siege, but it can also be used to deal AOE to small units in a pinch if it needs to.  The reduced range would keep it from being an abusable harassment ability. </TEXT>

<TITLE> /Starcraft Balance Map Organization Suggestions </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-20 00:13:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm really looking forward to the balance testing from the Reddit community: https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/4o73w4/rstarcraft_balance_test_map_balance_change/  

I do have one small suggestion for organizing feedback to make it easier for people to participate.  Right now, all the responses are put into the same thread, making it difficult to sort through duplicate suggestions and to determine what people care the most about. You can try searching, but it is often difficult to formulate a search term that accurately reflects what you are suggesting.  

Instead, I would like to suggest that a moderator organizes the suggestions thread like this:  

1.  Under the main posts are 3 master responses, titled Terran, Protoss, Zerg. These will be used as the 3 race subthreads.  
   
2.  Under each race subthread are several additional response subthreads, one for each unit in that race.  So under the Terran subthread, would be Marine, Marauder, Reaper, Hellbat, etc.  

3.  Also under each race subthread is an additional response called "Other."  This is for all suggestions that don't directly pertain to units.  


People would then put in their suggestions by responding to the individual unit subthreads or to the "other" subthread for each race.  This way, it will be easy to tell if your idea has already been suggested--simply go to the appropriate subthread and see what has been written.  This also helps the map creators easily see what are the most requested changes, since they can see how many responses there are under each category, how many upvotes under each category, etc.

<TITLE> Fixing the liberator in TvZ </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-17 23:40:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> From its inception, the liberator has been a tricky unit to balance.  Due to their versatility against both air and ground, they have become a mainstay of most terran compositions.  According to David Kims most recent community feedback, many Korean pros specifically point out that Zerg has a hard time dealing with liberator harassment: http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/forum/topic/20745116041  

David Kim's proposed changes include decreasing spore crawler root time or increasing Queen AA range, but both of these changes can have far reaching consequences outside of the ZvT liberator dynamic.  The spore crawler change would impact all forms of air harassment, and Queen's already have 7 AA range.  Thus, I am personally against both of the proposed changes.   
 
As an alternative, I would like to propose an increase in the transformation time of the liberator when switching attack modes.
 
Benefits:

-Allows the defending opponent to react to liberator harassment with a bit more lenience

-Forces the Terran player to commit when transforming, rather than doing so willy-nilly. It becomes a more meaningful risk-reward decision.  

-Would minimally affect the defensive role of the liberator

If this change is in the right direction, we can perhaps even un-nerf the ground attack radius.  The goal is to keep the liberator as a potent unit, but make its usage a more conscious choice, rather than something always used by default.  Would like to hear your thoughts on this. 

Edit: edited for clarity.

<TITLE> Mirror's Edge and motion sickness </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-06 23:31:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Saw this article today about one reviewer who basically couldn't complete his review due to the intense motion sickness he experienced playing Mirror's Edge catalyst.  
http://www.polygon.com/2016/6/6/11871262/mirrors-edge-catalyst-made-me-hella-motion-sick

The author states that he is an avid FPS fan, and that no other game gives him motion sickness like Mirror's edge.  Are other players experiencing similar sickness from playing Catalyst?  

P.S. 

In the article, he summarizes a theory of motion sickness from the Guardian: 

"The TL;DR is that the brain is often convinced by the motion in a game, but the inner ear is like, Nah bro, youre just sitting on your couch. This disagreement convinces the brain that you must be hallucinating, perhaps due to a poison you ingested. Therefore the brain sends alarm bells to your stomach to puke up the non-existent poison. Poof: motion sickness."

I've suffered from motion sickness for many years.  I basically cannot play any FPS for more than 30 minutes without puking.  But I'm pretty skeptical about this theory about the mind thinking you have been poisoned.  I mean, I can actually take hallucinogenic mushrooms and get crazy visual hallucinations, and yet feel no need to puke.  So it seems like this theory doesn't apply to me?  Hmm... </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why are LOTV new units mostly low tech? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-05 18:19:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Specifically the ravager, the liberator, and the adept.  These units have unique active abilities and are extremely powerful, to the point that all of them have been nerfed since release.  My question is this: why did blizzard decide to make these units so low tech, when their effectiveness, appearance, and lore make them seem more like high tech units?  Why is ravager the only zerg morph that doesn't require a prerequisite building?  Why don't liberators require tech labs, when they definitely look and operate like high tech units? And shouldn't the adept, with its fancy psionic transfer ability, be unlocked by cybernetics core or templar archives? 

Forcing these units to be low tech severely limits how strong/cool they can be, since early all-ins and timing attacks would be overpowered. Initially these units were way too good for the early game; consequently, they all were gimped in weird ways in the name of balance. Ravagers are unarmored and have less health than roaches, despite appearing more beefy and tough.  Adepts were nerfed by 1 damage against light units to prevent early game abuse--a pretty contrived adjustment that some people claim is still not enough.  Liberators had their AA attack nerfed recently, yet some are clamoring for a nerf to their ground attack as well. 

Wouldn't it make more sense for these strong units to appear mid or late game? Wouldn't a lot of these issues be solved if these units were high-cost, high-power tech units that require a significant time and financial commitment?  Am I alone in feeling this way? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Buff Photon Cannon Against Air : the Answer to PvZ </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-15 22:30:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Edit: Looks like a version of this suggestion will be in the next test map!  Thanks DK!  Thanks for all the feedback guys!

There seems to be a general consensus that Protoss struggles against Zerg early-mid game.  Particularly, Protoss has a hard time dealing with Overlord drops and Mutalisk harass, forcing them to always go PICA, resulting in a dearth of viable Protoss builds against Zerg. Unfortunately, the proposed nerfs to Zerg have not been widely embraced, as many players were hoping for a Protoss buff instead. David Kim has expressed that he wants simple changes that affect the least number of variables, so complete redesigns are off the table.  

I propose a simple change that may address all these issues:

-Buff photon cannon damage against air

This can be coded by making the Photon Cannon have separate ground and air attacks, both with the same animation, and then independently buffing the air damage.  

Potential benefits

-Help defend against Mutalisks

-Help defend against Overlord drops

-Provide a stronger role for the currently underused photon cannon

-Does not affect photon cannon cheese, since it is only buffed against air

-Barely affects PvT (Vikings cant shoot down; Liberators already cant attack buildings; would only affect banshee harass)


I believe this will greatly benefit Protoss defense in PvZ, providing some much needed breathing room without the potential side effect of being abusable offensively.  I would love to hear Reddits thoughts on this proposal.    





EDIT 1:  Got some great feedback.  Some people are suggesting to make this more specific by buffing damage only against light air or biological air.  I think these are both great ideas, especially if we don't want it to affect medivacs.

EDIT 2: I want to clarify that the idea is not to make Protoss impregnable from muta harass. I would only want to marginally buff the damage to the extent that it is slightly easier to defend multiple bases, buying time for stalkers and other anti-air units if you don't already have a cohort of Phoenixes on standby. Furthermore, with the right adjustment, I don't think this will encourage too much turtle style play, as Protoss remains just as vulnerable to ground-based harassment (zergling run-bys, roach/ravager timing attacks, lurkers)

<TITLE> Huawei product quality and customer service </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-28 21:04:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone!  Recently I saw Huawei unveil their new matebook tablet.  I've been looking for a windows tablet that's lighter than the surface pro, and this seems perfect!  But I've never owned Huawei products before.  I was hoping people here could help fill me in.

1. Do they make high quality products?  
2. Are their products durable/long-lasting?
3. Is their software generally robust and bug-free? 
4. When bugs are present, do they do a good job fixing them down the line?     
4. If I have any issues with my product, is their customer support good?  

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Suggestion: air units can block corrosive bile from hitting ground units under them </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-23 08:34:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I thought of this after reading about the proposed removal of tankivac.  A lot of people were concerned that this would make tanks far too vulnerable to corrosive bile, and that this would remove a degree of micro that made games more exciting.  While I am personally against tankivac, I do agree that it allows for micro and helps tank survival.  

I instead propose another way to utilize micro to help tanks survive against corrosive bile. What if corrosive bile, upon hitting an air unit, didn't continue passing to the ground?  The bile effectively stops after hitting the first unit in a vertical line.  This way, you could "shield" tanks with air units.  With proper micro, you can even swap between multiple air units hovering over the ground unit, in order to spread out the damage so that no individual unit is destroyed (think blink stalker micro). This way, tanks are no longer completely at the mercy of corrosive bile, without becoming a flying harassment tool. It also allows for a new defensive micro mechanic that is less inane than flying tanks.   

This change could have positive impacts on other aspects of the game as well.  For example, in ZvZ, corruptors, which are often useless when there are no air units, can protect lurkers by soaking up corrosive shots.  

I think this is an aesthetically intuitive behavior to implement. You would naturally expect that a projectile would stop if a physical object is in the way.  This change "feels" right.  And I hope others agree : )

<TITLE> Blizzard Staff to Korean Pros: "Think SC2 isn't fun? Play something else!" </TITLE>

<TEXT> It's making big news in Naver games section. Here is the original link:
http://sports.news.naver.com/esports/news/read.nhn?oid=347 aid=0000082270

SKT coach claims that the Blizz Korea staff told pro players "You don't think SC2 is fun?  Go play something else."

So far, no official comment from Blizzard regarding these statements yet.  Personally, I think stuff like this is unacceptable, and it will further damage the already deteriorating SC2 community.
