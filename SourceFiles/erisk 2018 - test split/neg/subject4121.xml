"2012 Hillary Clinton Supplied Weapons from Benghazi to Al-Qaeda in Syria

I am not sure if people here know what really is going on with Hillarie's investigation and i thought everyone knew about it but it seems a lot of people are still in the dark. So i will go ahead and refresh everyones memory with a short description. 

I am not sure if you know what really is going on but the real issue are not the emails and having a private server with confidential documents (which is also serious). The real issue is what the emails uncovered about Benghazi. Hillary and the Obama administration supplied weapons from Benghazi to Al-Qaeda in Syria. The weapons shipped during late-August 2012 were Sniper rifles, RPGs, and 125 mm and 155mm howitzers missiles pdf. Then those missiles were used against US soldiers. Upon investigating the situation the congress found the serial numbers of the missiles and they tracked them coming from a CIA banker in Qatar. Then Hillary and Obama tried to retrieve the evidence and the other missiles but the terrorists blackmailed them. So they paid the blackmail and send ambassador Steven to retrieve the missiles, then i am not sure what went down (assume the terrorists were greedy) but Stevens got killed. 

The rest you know... Hillary blamed a video and Obama used his power to cover up the rest. Congress knows what happened, and they fought hard to get the evidence (or whatever Comey did not destroy so far) but they came short when it came for the other gov branches to do their job and take them to court. 

And Hillary also got paid to help some businesses receive contracts and benefits in Libya. This was discovered in the emails by that reporter (forgot name) that exchanged a lot of emails with Hillary. 

The media knew about this stuff, which makes sense why they went all in on this election. There's a video that Gowdy Trey basically shit on the media and letting it assume that its their fault for having the job to reveal this to the people but failed to do so. Trey Gowdy On Media

Also they paid the blackmail with taxpayer money ( i think its the first blackmail ever payed by the USA, the one that supposedly was paid on exchange for US citizens captured by the terrorists which i think we never got) - this is my personal opinion. U.S. Concedes $400 Million Payment to Iran Was Delayed as Prisoner Leverage 

Edit: i forgot to mention what was the piece that put everything together and let to this truth. It turns out that a stupid monkey terrorist did not know how to use the missile (i think he insert it backwards - don't remember) and he left the half blown pieces on the ground and thankfully the serial number was not destroyed. 

Clinton - the Saudis have exported more extreme ideology than any other place on earth"
October 2013 WS speech in which Clinton acknowledged that the Saudis have exported more extreme ideology than any other place on earth over the course of the last 30 years. 

Clinton - Trying To Vet, Identify, Train And Arm Cadres Of Rebels
In that same speech, Clinton noted that she wanted to pursue a more robust, covert action trying to vet, identify, train and arm cadres of rebels in Syria, that would have fought both the government of President Bashar al-Assad and the Al-Qaeda-related jihadist groups that have, unfortunately, been attracted to Syria. 

Benghazi - Security Support Team reduction
State Department officials in Libya apparently understood the dangers. As noted in the Interim Progress Report, on several occasions in 2012 Ambassador Stevens and others at the U.S. embassy stressed within the Department of State the inadequacy of security in Libya and outlined the need for additional personnel.39 In fact, however, in the weeks before the attack there was a decrease in the modest U.S. military presence there. For many months, there was a sixteen-person Special Forces unit, known as the Security Support Team or the Site Security Team (SST), at the embassy in Tripoli. This unit was involved with protecting the U.S. compound. In August 2012, however, DOD briefed that at the request of the Department of 40 State, this unit was reduced to four personnel and their focus changed to training Libyan forces. General Ham told the committee that this reduction and transition was done despite his offer to retain the larger number. 

Benghazi - President was informed of the "Terrorist Attack"
Defense Department officials believed nearly from the outset of violence in Benghazi that it was a terrorist attack rather than a protest gone awry, and the President subsequently permitted the military to respond with minimal direction. 

Clinton/Podesta - U.S. saw the rise of the genocidal Islamic State as an opportunity
Responding to the strategy outlined in the notes, Podesta said, I think we are headed down this path in Iraq. But Syria elements are vexing, he added. 

Agree but there may be opportunities as the Iraqi piece improves, Clinton wrote back.

The message also reveals that the U.S. saw the rise of the genocidal Islamic State as an opportunity. With all of its tragic aspects, the advance of ISIL through Iraq gives the U.S. Government an opportunity to change the way it deals with the chaotic security situation in North Africa and the Middle East, the document says, adding, The most important factor in this matter is to make use of intelligence resources and Special Operations troops in an aggressive manner. 

Report by the Citizens Commission On Benghazi 

The war in Libya was unnecessary, served no articulable U.S. national security objective, and led to preventable chaos region-wide. 

Muammar Qaddafi was an ally of the United States in the Global War on Terror. 

The U.S. facilitated the delivery of weapons and military support to al Qaeda- linked rebels in Libya. 

The Citizens Commission on Benghazi (CCB) has discovered, that the ensuing civil war may well have been avoided, had the U.S. chosen to permit it. 

Qaddafi expressed interest in a truce, and possible abdication and exile out of Libya. He even pulled his forces back from several Libyan cities as a sign of good faith. 

No positive affirmation of consent from Washington, D.C. to pursue Qaddafis offer. The war continued and ultimately cost tens of thousands of lives. The U.S. failure to even consider Qaddafis request for talks, and its determination to enter and pursue this war in support of al-Qaeda-linked rebels, presents the appearance of a policy intent upon empowering Islamic forces with no measurable benefit to U.S. national security. 

The White House campaign appears to have been well-coordinated with U.S. Muslim Brotherhood organizations as well as Islamic state members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), who all joined in condemnation of the video, and, even more troubling, issued calls for restrictions on Americans free speech rights. 

On the day of the attacks in Benghazi, whether or not there was an official order to stand down, the result was the same. There were military assets, for example, at the U.S. base in Sigonella, in Sicily, Italy that could have been brought to bear, and perhaps could have saved the lives of the two men killed at the CIA Annex, the scene of the second attack that night. The failure to attempt to rescue these Americans amounts to a dereliction of duty. 

The U.S. was fully aware of and facilitating the delivery of weapons to the al-Qaeda-dominated rebel militias throughout the 2011 rebellion. The jihadist agenda of AQIM, the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), and other Islamic terror groups represented among the rebel forces was well known to U.S. officials responsible for Libya policy. 

The White House and senior Congressional members deliberately and knowingly pursued a policy that provided material support to terrorist organizations in order to topple a ruler who had been working closely with the West actively to suppress al-Qaeda. The result in Libya, across much of North Africa, and beyond has been utter chaos, disruption of Libyas oil industry, the spread of dangerous weapons (including surface-to-air missiles), and the empowerment of jihadist organizations like al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood. 

After Qaddafis regime had been ousted, a delegation from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) traveled to Libya to collect payment for the weapons the UAE had financed and Qatar had delivered to the Transitional National Council (TNC) during the war. The UAE delegation was seeking $1 billion it claimed was owed. During their visit to Tripoli, the UAE officials discovered that half of the $1 billion worth of weapons it had financed for the rebels had, in fact, been diverted by Mustafa Abdul Jalil, the Muslim Brotherhood head of the Libyan TNC, and sold to Qaddafi. 

Clinton - Benghazi Emails 

Clinton to Blumenthal - Fyi. The idea of using private security experts to arm the opposition should be considered. 

June 10-August 8, 2011Time period where Secretary Clinton was heavily involved in Libya policy 

Daniel Nasaw - The former secretary of state has maintained that the real-time operational details of diplomatic security were handled below her level. But information on the logistics around a 2011 visit to Benghazi were forwarded to Mrs. Clinton, according to emails released Friday. 

Schwerin to Pedestal - The documents released by the New York Times also show that Clinton received numerous briefing memos about Libya from Blumenthal, a longtime friend of the Clintons who was not employed by the State Department. The New York Times reported earlier this week that Blumenthal was also involved with a possible business venture in the country at the time.

Then I would awkwardly have to explain in 3 seconds that even though I look like a person who would steal your pizza, I am only trying to help. I would stumble on my words and say something like "I'm trying to help your pizza up". Then I'd spend the rest of the time thinking that she thinks I was stealing her pizza. That would make me feel anxious until the point I have to bring it back up in order to smooth it over but by the time I do this I have missed my stop and now I'm gonna be late to get my daughter for the weekend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Johnson's death was officially ruled a suicide by the Department of Defense. However, her father became suspicious when he saw her body in the funeral home and decided to investigate. The Army initially refused to release information, but did so under the Freedom of Information Act after Representative William Lacy Clay, Jr. raised questions about it at the congressional hearings over Pat Tillman's death.

The autopsy report and photographs revealed Johnson had a broken nose, black eye, loose teeth, burns from a corrosive chemical on her genitals, and a gunshot wound that seemed inconsistent with suicide. Several reporters have suspected that the chemical burns were to destroy DNA evidence of a rape." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was responding to why people aren't getting upset enough to protest gerrymandering. The fact there are more important issues is one of the reasons in my opinion. 
I never said it shouldn't be discussed or discredited the importance in talking about it.  I'm saying that our country is kinda fucked at the moment and there is bigger shit to protest than gerrymandering that isn't happening. So because protesting(actual protesting not gathering for a couple days then going home) isn't happening with the bigger shit it's not going to happen with gerrymandering. 
As for the lame stream media...yeah it's fucking dumb. Whether it's Fox, CNN or MSNBC, etc...it's all shit. They just push agendas and try to divide us even more than we are and unfortunately it shapes the opinions of millions if americans. Journalism is dead and it's only getting worse. 

Also, I bet you automatically making assumptions about people then making the wrong read on them has caused problems for you. I bet not a lot of people like being around you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not divisive or "sexy" enough of an issue for the lame stream media to report on. It doesn't evoke enough rage. It doesn't involve Trump or the Russians or gorillas so all the millions of mouth breathers don't hear about it since most let the tv tell them how they should think. So there is little to know buzz on the subject. 

Or maybe people just don't give a shit since America has become the public laughing stock along with the rest of the developed world's reality show. We have a lot worse issue to deal with that aren't getting protested over. Our whole system is broken and it goes a lot deeper than gerrymandering.

That being said more white people have been killed by cops than black people. The media doesn't talk about or show it because they want to keep us divided. There are a lot black people who have been killed by cops because the color of their skin but that's not all who are being killed. It's just the only thing being shown because its something else to make people pick sides and be divided. Either you're on the side of the cops or you are aren't. It's,all utter bullshit.

<TEXT> It's only coded language because you're making it that way. I understand  that some people do use the word thug as a way to be racist in more of "socially accepted" manner but to assume every white person does is what pisses people off thus widening the divide. Words only have the power that you give it.
You said people called them criminals. Nobody said they were "criminals". They said they were thugs because they were acting thuggish. If they were white I'd say they were thugs. I damn well wouldn't put it off as "just some dumbasses". I would call them thugs. Same with a Mexican soccer team if that happened, or an Indian cricket match, or a Norwegian whatever the fuck they do. You get my point. I know it's tough to let your guard down but not every white person is a racist who uses the word thug when referring to a black person. And you assuming that is what continues this bullshit mobius strip we're in as a society. </TEXT>

The thing is that as long as there are different races there's going to be racism. It's not going away no matter how many social justice warriors there are. The key is to understand that we don't have to accept people, just respect them as a fellow human. Then we can get along. Instead we just spin our wheels wasting time fighting the wrong enemy. My point is that this divisive shit has to stop. When we are divided we are easier to conquer and you are just widening the divide.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My grandpa is definitely still able to yell that.

p.s. I know this might come as a shock to you but you're the reason Trump is in office. You're "everything is racist", safe space, divisive bullshit rhetoric is what put him there. You can blame "white people" or the "spooky" Russians all you want but that isn't the reason why. You. You are the reason why. I know you won't understand why what I'm saying is true but that's just because you're a racist ;) Happy Inauguration Day  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't agree its gossip but, I mean, they're kinda right. It just feels like we are spinning our wheels. Of course the gov't is saturated with corruption and fucked up shit.  We know that. They need to be hanged from the gallows. We know that. It just gets very frustrating because it seems like the same shit we know keeps getting circulated and it lulls us to sleep. When are we going to get to the point where we start doing shit about it or at least really start talking about action? I know the roadblocks that are in the way...Gestapo police force, apathy, social media making people lazy, gadgets making us too comfortable, no individual power, hard to mobilize and plan without being spied on, etc.
But there has to be a way. Corruption, murder, money laundering, and pedophilia are happening at the highest levels and it seems like all we do is talk about it, flip the page to read about the next thing, get angry about how fucked up it is, and then roll our eyes and go on to the next fucked up thing to be angry about(rightfully so). 
I don't know the answers to what we can do (trying to open people's eyes is valiant but just doesn't produce the results we need) I'm just overly frustrated. It seems like we just constantly spin our wheels and wait for shit to come out so we can "see, I told you so" then rinse, wash and repeat. I am guilty of this as well. Maybe it's just time to stay in my bubble I created and shut out everything and everyone not in it. I know that's counterproductive and it makes me feel like I've given up but maybe I'll be happier. Anyways, sorry for frustrated rant. Carry on.

This is not a partisan issue. We have to stop this divisive bullshit and stop looking to these crooks like they have the answers and our best interest in mind. We have to get back to knowing our neighbors, properly utilizing our land and focusing on who we put in local office. The soap opera, tv politicians have nothing for us.

That being said, there are still massive amounts of pedophilia happening in our gov't that is being covered up. Pizzagate is there to make it ALL seem crazy meanwhile it's happening right under our noses and is being covered up just like the Lawrence King thing in Nebraska and countless others. To make the rape of children into a political thing is sickening. It's happening across the board, both sides. So fuck all this republican and democrat shit and focus on the children.

<TEXT> Just a quick thought. Trying to get other people's opinions on it.
I'm starting to get this sinking feeling that Hillary is going to be president.
It just seems "they" are putting the pieces in place to be able to perform a coup.
Whether it's pushing the popular vote thing, some electors saying they won't put Trump in, now saying the Russians hacked shit to win election for orange julius, and so on and so forth...
With all these corporate douchebags that Trump is putting in his cabinet and "transition team", like the ceo of Exxon, it seems to me like he knows he isn't going to be president and is just making more super elite buddies in order to help his businesses when he goes back to that shit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "On November 13, a Swedish prosecutor agreed to interrogate Julian Assange at the embassy of Ecuador.The interrogation took place six years after the Swedish prosecutor issued an arrest warrant and extradition against the founder of Wikileaks, to respond to allegations of rape and assault two women whom he met in Stockholm, AA and SW Three weeks after that interview, Assange has decided to publish its full declaration, eldiario.es offers exclusive and serves as a chronology of his case.

In the first part of the document, Julian Assange describes the climate of persecution and harassment that precedes and surrounds your trip to Stockholm.Two weeks earlier, Wikileaks had published thediaries of the war in Afghanistan, some 75,000 classified Pentagon documents with information about the death of tens of thousands of people.Assange documents the escalation of threats articles media like The New York Times, The Washington Post and Harper's magazine, where Pentagon statements and the Ministry of Defense posed drastic and even illegal measures to capture the Australian.

Harassment extends to other members of Wikileaks, which are repeatedly detained at airports and other countries.Washington warns Switzerland to "carefully consider offering asylum to someone who is fleeing from the law", and Iceland that could be a review of its relations with theUS because of thenewspapers.Arriving in Sweden, Assange finds that Wikileaks accounts and cards have been canceled."Because of this (...) I had to rely on others, not just to have a roof but for food and money."This is where the two women who accused him of sexual assault, harassment and rape fall.

"SW knew an unusual amount of things about me"

During the first days, Assange had stayed home from AA, members of the Swedish Social Democratic Party, AA, with whom he had relations.SW Meet in a chat and a later meal, which they leave together.The woman makes it clear he wants to have sex with him and the two go by train to his home in Enkoping, west of the city.

According to the Australian, W. behaves flamboyant and intensely, asking if stays home and getting angry A. when looking at his mobile instead of paying full attention."SW knew an unusual amount of things about me."Assange feels that "risked reveal my location and could behave unpredictably if I thought that was rejecting".Later he discovers that his Flickr account was full of pictures of him.Despite his intuition, they sleep together "four or five times" between night and the next morning.She accompanies him to the train, where goodbye with a kiss and remain on call.She does it the next day but he is so busy that he does not until a week later, when someone warns that W. is in the hospital."At first I was afraid I had hurt herself to get my attention."He is wrong: the girl is being done tests can rule out STDs and he also wants to do.Julian can not go that day and left for Saturday.The next day Assange learns from the international press has been arrested "in absentia" for rape.

"The police had invented the charges"

To support their claimthat sex was agreed at all times, Assange appointment W. messages sent during those days from your mobile and that the police seized.There heshares with someone his desire for Assange ( "I want him. I want him") and later says all is well between them, except for STD testing.More relevant to thecase, he writes that "did not want toaccuse Julian Assange of nothing" and that "the police wanted tocatch him" and that was a shock hearing the accusation of rape.He also said that "the police had invented the charges" and that she only wanted the test was done.Later in several exchanges of messages with AA, the two women talk to tell their story to the press in exchange for money.Assange believes that these "speak for themselves".

On the main charge, that she was asleep when he entered and did not consent to maintain without acondom, Assange says, "is false. I was sure that SW was not asleep. I was also sure that he had given his consent to have unprotected sex before having sex. "In their messages the night of their first meeting and says "JA (Assange) willnot use condoms."That morning, moments after the alleged rape, W. wrote that " Iwas half asleep."

A pattern of illegal conduct

Assange says in his statement voluntarily spent five weeks in Sweden to answer all police questions and only left when I got permission from the prosecutor to return to London and the case was closed.

Shortly later, on November 29, Wikileaks Cablegate begins publication.251,287 diplomatic cables of the US State Department come to light with the help of a consortium of media including The New York Times, The Guardian, Le Monde, Der Spiegel and El Pais.

"The cables revealed that Swedish intelligence services had a pattern of illegal behavior when they were at stake the interests of the US government," says Assange, including cases of torture linked to the CIA.

Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements" of Assange.The case reopens.

Assange explained in a letter published this document because "I want people to know what abuse has been this process", which has not been entitled to the presence of his Swedish lawyer Per E. Samuelsson, or access to documents handled the prosecution.He also reiterated that the refusal of the Swedish prosecutor to conduct interrogation in the last six years is illegal and unacceptable.

Some preliminary that stretch six years

From the outset, the prosecutor who reopened the case, Marianne Ny,told the mediathat the Swedish law and the British did not contemplate the possibility that Julian Assange could offer testimony electronically, or anywhere that does not outside Sweden, including the Swedish embassy in London itself.Two years later, Ny admitted thatthere was a mutual legal assistance treatythat allowed that kind of arrangement, but it was not appropriate because itneeded toquestion himin person.

The agreement, however, provides the ability to interrogate Assange by telephone, video or in person, accompanied by British police, with the permission of the Ecuadorian embassy.During all this time, Assange has maintained at all times." that the accusation is a pretext to extradite him to the US, where he could face the death penalty because of the leak of secret US documents by Wikileaks."

Then it shows the letter he sent from "December 7th, 2016".

<TEXT> It was a false flag. He is a crisis actor that did this to escape jail time for hitting the teen with his car.  He has an imdb page, ties to the owner of Comet Pong Pong,  he hit a teenager and fucked them up permanently with his car a month ago and facing charges, THE WASHINGTONIAN WROTE ABOUT IT BEFORE IT HAPPENED, traffic cameras were taken down and moved hours before the incident, and his dad has a film studio and ties to correct the record. 

It was set up to make it seem like this "fake news" stuff is gone too far and it's creating "crazy conspiracy theorists" so it must be stopped. They are trying to discredit everything without addressing the evidence and connections. All mainstream media on tv and internet is scrambling to try and supress it. Once you lift the vail over your eyes it's easy to see what they are doing.

Like this whole pizzagate thing. They are saying it's fake news without explaining what it even is or discussing the connections to Podesta and everybody else. You have to admit he is sick. Who has art like that in their house? The pedo rings are being run by the likes of people like Jeffery Epstein and company. Blackmail is a powerful tool. He has dirt on many people. Isn't it worth it to the kids to at least have a real investigation into this? I guess not.  </TEXT>

This has been a huge problem for a long time, not only in our country but all over the globe all the way back to ancient Greece. Hell, up till 1880 you could marry a 7 year old in Delaware. All the details and to what extent this is happening we don't know yet but it's happening and right under our noses at that. People are starting to wake up though. The ball is now rolling and one day these fucks will be exposed as long as we keep fighting for the truth.

I have looked into it a bunch and how nazi "doctor" Josef Mengel experimented with it during MKUltra shit. After looking into it, my OPINION is that mind control drugs are used to make the victim look cognizant while doing fucked up shit, whether it's kids or doing false/red flag attacks. 
So no, of course I don't have a video of Podesta fucking Barney Frank and his conveyor of young lads or whatever. I guess that means it doesn't happen.

<TEXT> It's because Trump's only reason for being in this divisive, dog and pony show presidential race is to ensure Hillary wins. He has no desire to be president. He only wants his own news network and he'll get it. Get ready for the Trump News Network because it's gonna happen. Bill and Hillary are his friends. Not only has he donated to the Clinton Foundation slush fund but they were at his wedding, they've flown together on Jeffrey Epstein's pedophile plane to kiddie fuck island, and right before Trump declared he was running for president he had a nice long talk with Bill on the phone. Wonder what that was all about? We need to realize we're all just pawns in a game we're not even playing. Until people turn off the tv and get just as excited about who we put into local office as we do the oval one, then nothing changes. Our only other option is to physically take our country back. That, unfortunately, won't happen either since people are able to just bitch online, buy the new iphone, catch pokemons, and get drunk on the weekends to forget the shit we are living in. Or we get our heads bashed in by our Gestapo/militarized police force before we even get to D.C.  So what can we do other than create and stay in our own little bubble of carefully selected loved ones and try not to worry as our country is being meticulously taken away from us and the dollar crashes, making us dive headfirst into WWIII?

<TEXT> This is only to make people feel better so they forget about it even though nothing is really being done. This is only on the federal level and not the State/local level where a little over 80% of people are incarcerated. The feds dont care about incarceration rates but the states sure the fuck do since they make tons of money off of cheap prison labor and fines off of things like possession of a plant. 
Look for private prisons to expand now at the state and local level. This is still a huge issue that should not be considered anywhere close to being fixed. It's symbolic gesture at best in order for get people to forget about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a stagehand. We always eat and/or split up what the band doesn't eat or drink when they are gone. Well, a couple of us went back to the green room and started chowing down because we thought they were all gone. Turns out they were not. They all walked in to us scarfing down their food. Our collective heads slowly looked up at once like a deer looking up from it's salt lick. We just kinda stared at each other for about 8 seconds. We then just nodded at 'em, mouth full of their tuna/burgers and walked passed them not making eye contact. 
The best part of this story is that one of them still ate half their burger that I didn't finish. So just for a little bit I felt the roles were reversed and it was glorious.

He made a shit load of money doing that. Then all of a sudden he disappeared for a few years only to come back and find Ruthless Records.  Then all of these rappers who turned out to be amazing and extremely influential joined his label and it was history. Makes me wonder if he wasn't helping the C.I.A. sell cocaine first.

<TEXT> Most in this sub know that the gov't used gangster rap as a weapon but nobody really discusses the players in the scheme.

Rock/Grunge were going to be the staple of modern music in the mid 80's to mid 90's until they saw an opportunity to make white people scared of black youth, which were made angry and aggressive through gangster rap and living conditions in their forced and designated sections of cities, in order to divide us even more than we already are. It's the same time as the L.A. riots was going on as well.

Well, during this time Ice T(Body Count/Cop Killer), Ice Cube (N.W.A./Fuck the Police) and Courtney Love (Kurt Cobain) were all players in the game, in my opinion.

I was sitting around thinking about how Ice T went from clean cut, to 4 yrs in Army, to robbing, to famous rapper, to famous actor, and so on and so forth. Then I started thinking about how Ice Cube sold his first song to Ice T at 16 like he was being groomed or something. I mean, hell, his first rap group was even called C.I.A. ha. Anyways, he went from groomed by Ice T, to famous gangster rapper, to famous movie star and so on and so forth. Now, this is where Courtney comes in. She is the child of Linda, a renowned psychotherapist from San Francisco and Hank Harrison, who was the road manager and publicist of the C.I.A. project The Grateful Dead. She went from orphan, to stripper, to jailed for theft, to a musician/actress, to dating (Corgan) and marrying (Cobain) famous rock stars, then famous musician and famous actress. 

Obviously this is all speculation and me not being able to sleep but it seems that the gov't groomed Ice T and Ice Cube. They played ball and came out with a genre of music that would anger black youth and make them think it's cool to sell the drugs the C.I.A. was bringing in, as well as dividing the country w/ race. By doing this they were promised they'd be set for life. Millions of dollars, acting fame, musical fame, etc. Same for Courtney. They promised her millions of dollars, acting/musical fame and relevance. All she had to do was kill grunge...which she did when she had Kurt murdered. 

Anybody else out there ever think about this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree and without needlessly going on and on, I'll just say that I do all of that and more. However, it still isn't enough. We can't get enough numbers to do anything.  As long as people continue to be a slave to technology and apathetic instead of angry it will continue. As long as the under qualified, trigger happy, militarized police force have their boots to our necks, most people aren't willing to risk getting their ass beat, losing their jobs, going to jail, etc for a war they think isn't winnable. Enough people don't realize their will to fight is being snuffed out by social media and technology. I mean, how bad does it have to get until people put down their laptops and pick up their "pitchforks"? Unfortunately, I believe we are going to find out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No you are not. They want us to be distracted by this divisive dog and pony show that is the presidential race. The president is picked for us and our votes don't matter. Trump is only here to make sure The Dark Queen wins and Bernie is just here to give the illusion of hope and give the sjw's more migro-aggressions to waste their energy on. Unless we all start ignoring this pander pageant and get as passionate with who we put in local office as who we do in the oval one, then nothing will change. Personally, I don't think people are all of a sudden going to stop voting against their own self interest and just start educating themselves using the right avenues. We need to get out into the streets and I'm not talking about this Occupy bullshit where people just sing kumbaya and make people late for work. In order to make real change anger must replace apathy and convenience. I'm not very optimistic but I have a lot of popcorn and people in my bubble. Time to sit back, relax and watch the show. But make no mistake, in the rare instance that we actually do get fed up enough to take our country back then you'll be able to find me on the front lines. Change starts from the ground up not the top down.

Edit: Words and such

<TEXT> I see everyone is giving into this divisive dog and pony show. The presidency was decided in 2008. Trump is here to ensure the Dark Queen gets the White House and Bernie is just here to give the illusion of hope. The whole system is broken and rigged against us yet we waste energy and time fighting against ourselves. That is what they want us to do. If we really want change it has to start from the ground up not from the top down. We have to get as riled up and excited about who we put in local office as we do who we put in the Oval Office. We are too distracted by surface and non-issues and our freedoms and voices are being suppressed as we sit idly by. Our responsibility doesn't end at the voting booth. That's where it begins. How bad does it have to get until anger finally replaces apathy and we decide to take OUR country back? If we ALL don't do some quick growing up and come together we will soon find out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The current Democratic Party needs to be dead to us. They only speak for their own corrupt agenda. We must look past the tribalism and break our ties to it.  We need a true Democratic Party, or 5, that doesn't try by any means possible to silence the voices of their own party.
It started way back in 1776, with the Constitution, when James Madison felt the country should be designed, and with his initiative, was designed for the power and control of America to be in the hands of the wealthy. He did this because he thought the wealthy were the more responsible citizen. So he ended up giving the power to the Senate, which at that time wasn't voted on but picked from the wealthiest of men. The system has been stacked against us since the beginning. I hate to say it but your vote doesn't matter right now. If voting mattered they wouldn't let us do it. The people that count the votes elect the politicians not the people who cast them. The change that you want to see happen won't happen until we stop being apathetic and scared and get out into the streets...And I'm not talking about this Occupy Wall St. shit where we all just sing Kumbaya and make it more difficult for our fellow man/woman to get to work. We have to stop being too apathetic and scared to try and take the power back from the ones who get ahead by making us powerless. Our freedoms are being taken away right in front of us and yet we sit and do nothing while the ones who destroy our country laugh at us with impunity. We are on the verge of losing OUR country and if we don't fight to get it back now then we might not have the chance again in our lifetimes. How bad is it going to have to get before we say "enough is enough"?

Too many people get left out that way.....and it makes no sense when you think about it.

<TEXT> Ah, I see. That was because I made those comments before knowing the conditions. I was going off just a picture that basically just said "Look at this frostbite shit that took 6 hours. There is no way I would be able to make a shelter and do all that in those conditions. On the other hand, I would've never put myself in that position to start with. If being smart enough to not put oneself in those positions comes off to some people as arrogant then maybe that just proves my point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure what the Man V. Wild thing is but can tell you that your vast and generalized statements are as ever accurate as you think they are. As a former paralegal in the Marine Corps, I can honestly tell you that I couldn't hack it in those conditions without the proper equipment either. So my point is whether you're a Marine or someone who sits behind a computer all day is irrelevant. You wouldn't be able to "hack" it no matter what who you are if you don't have the necessary provisions. However, if you read my first post, my awe was in the fact that it got that severe in such a "short" amount of time. So your attempt to macho up over the internet by assuming I'm weak is falling on dead ears my fellow human. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, but in only 6 hours? I mean make a snow shelter, hide behind rocks/trees or something. I'd have to know the details but it seems like the will for self preservation would stave off that level of frostbite for at least 6 hours in a Canadian blizzard. Also, did he not see it coming? How does a blizzard just sneak up on someone? Was he incapacitated in some level before the blizzard? 

Edit: Easy there internet, I posted this before I knew what the conditions were. Obviously 6 hours is no small amount of time in those conditions and would fuck your shit up. Maybe one shouldn't go out alone, or ever, in conditions like those. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been wondering if the tea party was started just to get religious nuts into office so the powers that be can use them as a front, to make sure as many babies are born and birth certificates made, in order for tax and permanent debt purpose?

 It would be an excellent smokescreen. Everybody, including the pulpit politicians, thinking it's a moral argument when it's just a cover for as many people to be born into debt as possible.

 I've been thinking about this lately and wanted to get other people's perspectives on it. Thank you very much for any response. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd rather vote for the evil idiot than the evil genius and here's why. I hate Trump as much as the next person but Hillary is evil on a whole other level that vastly overshadows Trump. 
Trump just says "politically incorrect" shit that a lot of people find offensive. Well, what the hell do you expect an old, white billionaire that lives on top of a tower to say? He has more moderate stances(for planned parenthood, gay marriage, no Iraq war, auditing the fed, against the TPP and other free trade,etc) than any of the Republicans still in the race.
Again, let me reiterate, I think Trump is a piece of shit but let's have some FUCKING PERSPECTIVE. Hillary would be waaay worse for this country and if anyone has their head in the sand and doesn't understand why I would say that, please do your research on it.  I'm not giving people shit for protesting him. Do your thing. Have fun, protest him, get mad and pretend you're doing something that matters so you feel better. That's fine and dandy. However, be honest with yourselves and realize that you're just protesting and getting riled up for PC culture and IT ACCOMPLISHES NOTHING, except feels.  
    Trump will destroy the broken republican party(the fringe right), as we know it. He is the monster on the loose that they created and if elected, it will lead to the dissolvement of the fringe republican right(neo-Libertarians) and make the party more centrist, which means no more candidates like Trump, Cruz, Fiorina, Huckabee, Carson, etc. That alone, along with multitudes of other reasons(in pocket of big banks/fossil fuels, Mena, Whitewater, 4 current Federal investigations, Clinton Foundation, Libya, Kissinger, intimidating rape victims, grabbing a staffers arm and making her cry, Chinese backers, free trade, Syria, etc, etc) are why 4 years of Trump would be better than 8 years of Hillary. Trump is a huge asshole but Hillary is a murderer and should be treated as such.

That being said...Go Bernie!

<TEXT> You are part of the problem then, congrats.
Hillary is way worse. I understand you don't like how Trump says offensive things but that's all he does. He is more to the middle than any other republican left. That being said, I am a Bernie supporter as well as someone who thinks Trump is a piece if shit. However, 8 years of Hillary would be waaaay worse than 4 years of Trump and here is why. If elected, Trump would destroy and dissolve what we know of the Republican party today. It would force the fringe right to make their own party (Neo-Libertarians) that would just be mostly ignored instead of running the party like today. The republican party would have to come back to the center a good amount and that is what this country needs. If Hitlery was president it would decimate this country even more. With all her flip flopping on important issues in order to pander as well as being in the pockets of big banks and and big oil/fossil fuels, do you really think for a second that she wouldn't expedite the destruction of our country? Just think how bad a second term Hillary, that doesn't have to worry about being re-elected, would be. By the way, I didn't even mention how she is on trades (she'll support the TPP) or how she's a warhawk and a sociopathic, power hungry murderer. You think that's far fetched then I implore you to do some research on your own about it. Listen, I get that you think Trump is worse but please have some perspective. Trump panders to his base and says stupid shit but that's all it is. His supporters should be hated more than him even though I understand his rhetoric causes them to get riled up. But believe me when I tell you that if he is elected he will be more socially center (he's for marriage equality, planned parenthood, etc) than you think and that will lose him that redneck, racist fan base. 

That said, hopefully, it won't come to that and Bernie escapes the inevitable assassination attempt and becomes president but I fobt think it will happen. Anyways, if this is the scenario please vote with your brain and not with your emotions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's amazing that people are so willing to look the other way and still support her. I guess that's what happens when brand name is more important than substance. No wonder corporations hype up product wars. It's starts at home then the next thing you know people instinctively apply the same process to who they blindly vote for. It's all a game that we aren't really a part of. Oh well, our president is chosen for us anyways so it doesn't matter. But buck up buckaroo, you have 76 different types of shampoo you can choose from. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did you even read my post? I think Trump is a fucking piece of shit and hope Bernie pulls a miracle and wins. I just don't think its going to happen because the powers that be want Hillary in the oval office. My point is that there is a bigger game at play with more at stake but you can't see that from within your tiny box, apparently. I don't watch the news, unless it's to make fun of it, because it's full of propaganda and lies. You have no fucking clue what you're talking about or who I am. Look at my post history before making baseless assumptions. You are a dullard and a sheep.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why voting for Trump's jackass would be better than voting for Hillary.

 "She is a proven hawk. She has only made this more explicit by her recent praise for Henry Kissinger, a war criminal and zealous militant who is probably responsible for nearly four million deaths.

 2. If elected Clinton would taint the reputation of the Democratic Party with her corruption and dishonesty. This impact could last decades. (Long enough for seven Supreme Court justices to be appointed by Republicans, in a worst case scenario.)

 3. She is so conservative that it would shift the entire national spectrum rightward for her to represent Democrats. If we accept that Hillary's position on the spectrum is the left, we will have allowed the right wing to pull the entire national conversation drastically to the right. A Hillary Clinton Presidency would be a huge win for the right wing, despite all of the kicking and screaming they might perform.

 4. If America wants neoliberalism, I prefer it be under Trump, because then when we learn our lesson about how damaging this economic policy is to our very sovreignty, we will have somewhere to turn to correct our course. If we do allow Hillary to drag the national spectrum to the right there will be nowhere left to turn when we are ready to grow up and stop acting like the Somalia of the west.

 5. Thomas Jefferson wrote that a well-informed electorate is a prerequisite to democracy. To reward the unethical style of campaigning that Hillary has used both in the 2008 primaries and now in the 2016 primaries by allowing it to be a path to the White House would lead to more of the same. Candidates from then on would know that unscrupulous and devious campaigning is how to win. For Clinton's tactics to be rewarded, especially by Democrats, would undermine our very democracy.

 6. Hillary has shown herself to be corruptible. Trump would not be susceptible to the types of monetary incentives that Hillary has shown herself to be.

 7. Hillary Clinton's Presidency, and the corrupt means by which she achieved the office, would be taken by many to be emblematic of what we might expect should we elect a woman President. The sentiment that Hillary's presidency could be held to be indicative of what we can expect as a result of electing a woman to the highest office would work in direct opposition to the pursuit of true gender equality. This thinking may be wrong, but it would be common. The damage to the viability of the Presidential candidacies of honorable women who have the potential to be great leaders, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, would be significant and long-lasting. Repercussions of the backlash which would result from this symbolic first being a monumental disaster would be felt in all areas of public life. Contrary to what Hillary might have you believe, her election would be huge step backward for egalitarianism.

 8. There is far too much disloyalty to the electorate inside the beltway. Bernie Sanders might have said this best when he said "Sometimes I think that the people in this institution and the White House are really losing contact in not knowing whats going on with the American people,...[The American people] hold this institution in contempt, they hold the Republican Party in contempt, they hold the Democratic Party in contempt. Hillary Clinton is not a variation from this theme. She does not represent the people. She has been an insider in the corrupt game we call "politics" for a long time now, as her surname can attest to. A second President Clinton would quintessentially embody the perpetuation of a dynasty of indifference to the will of the people.

 9. Her election would be deeply demoralizing for those who have a vision of a future for this country that transcends what focus groups and polls tell them. Visionaries are the architects of the future. We can do better than to darken their visions with Hillary's unique brand of dreamless cynicism.

 10. The Democratic party seems to be drifting ever toward the right. It's time for Democratic voters to wake up. If losing an election is what it takes to makes that happen, it will be worth it. I hope it doesn't come to that but it would be far more preferable than a gradual unrecognized slip toward conservatism.

 11. Because if the way she panders to demographics Hillary Clinton is a divisive figure; The opposite of what a leader must be. Leaders must bring unity to those they lead, they must find what is common and shared among the citizens, or they cannot lead effectively and risk deepening the fissures which make life more difficult for all decent people. Despite my opinions on his positions on most issues it is clear to me that even a nation unified under Donald Trump may have more potential to advance toward the goals we all share than a nation divided under Hillary Clinton would.

 12. Finally, and probably least compelling: For all of these reasons I've discussed, because she constantly underestimates the intelligence of the American people in her transparent dishonesty in its myriad forms, because she stands for so little but makes such a loud noise about it, because she is so remorseless for the many mistakes she has made, I find her to be deeply, grindingly, vexatious in a way a blockhead like Trump could never be."

<TEXT> If the situation were reversed we wouldn't even be hearing about this. This is such a desperate, sad and transparent attempt from a campaign who is worried that they'll lose another shoe-in presidential nomination. Our two party system doesn't work and we are the laughing stock of the world. Taking just a second to really think about what this country has become is too depressing to do anymore. Maybe it's just time to bury my head in the sand only to be woken if/when the revolution takes place and we take the people who think they can't be touched and drag them out into the streets.

<TEXT> Not really. It plays a part but more the fact that due to economic factors, lack of opportunities and other reasons, a lot of ass holes join the military. Now you give them a rifle and tell them it's fine to kill the brown skin people overseas.. and then they do with impunity. They cause even more hell there on top of what's already going on with the war. Then they come back home and cause shit here and can't get any help from the joke of a VA. That, combined with our horrible overall mental healthcare system and the crippling of the middle class, is going to ensure the cycle continues. I obviously know that there are a lot of good people in the military but a higher percentage are pieces of shit. People just blindly treat all of them like they are heros and it's bullshit.

<TEXT> Absolutely.  I was flipping through the MSM "news" outlets and HOLY FUCK, the fear mongering strong with these ones.
      Nothing but "ISIS is going to attack D.C. and the rest of america"  and "We need more boots on the ground" and all the military "experts" saying our military is only 30% ready to go to battle because they need more money for training and that the military is being severely underfunded.
  It was hilarious. TPTB don't even have to try anymore. It's right in front of our face yet nothing will or can be done. The masses have spoken. Convenience over confrontation. 

America is a joke, filled with people whose anger and empathy reaches only as far as their ethernet cables.

<TEXT> There's a lot of underlying shit going on with this "terrorist" attack. This is to see who all is on the "I fucking hate brown people" team in order to see who our allies potentially are when we go up against China and Russia and the ME. This is just the start of what's gonna be a loooong, bloody(ier) ordeal in my opinion.
We will get into a small Vietnam in the middle east as the crude barons try one last time to take control of the oil while our dependence on it gets less and less. That will upset china. They will hit the button and tank the dollar. America will have no choice but to show its military might because it's all they have. Russia will join China and the ME because they are just looking for the right opportunity to kick America in the dick. America will have the "I hate brown people" countries and all will go to war. Japan is on our side so we can use them logistically to fight China and Turkey is too for the same reasons.  Just my ramblings. Any thoughts? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why is everyone angry Bevin won? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-04 22:02:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> To all the people who are all riled up about Bevin winning....Why get mad now? Of course he was going to fucking win! Seriously think about it. Do you recall any social media posts about how important it is to keep Bevin out of office prior to like 5 days ago? No. To the people who blame voter turn out for this, you are WRONG. How can someone buy something they have no idea is for sale? How can people vote if they don't know there's an election? You can't. There was an independent study done at the campus of U of L and only 12% of the student body even knew there was an election. The blame lies in the horribly run campaigns and most importantly the blame falls on US. Where we're all the anti-Bevin posts a week ago, a month ago or 4 months ago?! How many of you canvassed the streets w/ the message "Keep Bevin Out" and told everyone there was an election coming up and if you're poor this Bevin guy will let you die in order to line his master's pockets? And how many of you just watched a John Oliver segment and decided to get angry when it was too late? People vote just so they can feel like they aren't part of the problem when shit hits the fan. Well you ARE part of the problem. You have to get out there and evoke real change instead of just sitting behind a computer talking to like minded individuals about how liberal you are. This Bevin is a real piece of shit...and right now we ALL deserve every year of him.

      But don't worry, none of this really matters. Soon China will finally collapse the U.S. dollar and we will head into a second Vietnam in the middle east to make up for it. And all that should eat up enough time and resources to be weak when China decides it wants to go to war, with the whole support of the world behind them. So cheer up, and forget about Bevin because things will get a lot worse. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Who gives a flying fuck about some Kathy Bates in Misery, outfit wearing bigot from Kentucky! I wish people got as mad at the real issues like the TPP, extension of the Patriot Act, the fact an evil man is buying the water in California for $524 just to sell it back to people in bottle form, etc etc, as they do with some dime a dozen bigot. Where was all the angry posts then? Everybody gets so worked up about micro-aggressors and divisive issues that they are blind to the actual fucked up shit that's happening right under their nose. Assholes like this woman aren't going away no matter what anyone does. All you do by posting shit about her is add fuel to the fire and increase her popularity. If you want people like that to stop having an effect on people and to go away then stop posting shit about her. Ignore people like that and it takes away their influence. This is why nothing gets done in this country. People are too worried about the color of dresses, Caitlyn Jenner's dick, a murdered Lion, a racist flag, some homophobic bitch in KY, Ashley Madison and whatever other bullshit the media decides they want you to get mad at. Wake the fuck up people.....or don't. This country is probably fucked beyond repair, anyways. And it's been a collective effort to make it this way. We are all at fault. </TEXT>

There is no evidence he got them illegally but they can't determine or won't determine how he acquired all of it.

<TEXT> I agree and disagree. You see the current brand of the far right. I do think it would get bad enough that people would be forced to finally get their head out of the sand.  You see everyone in the streets protesting about racism and inequality. Just image if people realized the government is puppeteering this in order to divide and concur the masses, thus making us easier to control. They are having us fight amongst ourselves about race in-between stories of people changing genders and articles about what celebrity looks fat in a bikini in order to distract us from the fact that laws are being pushed through that continues the destruction of our country. I think people would wake up and start going after the real criminals. I would hope so anyways. If not.....I heard New Zealand is nice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I respectfully disagree but I understand where you're coming from. The little remaining anarchist in me though would vote far right in that scenario just so it would get so bad the people will revolt and force actual change. By selecting evil, on any scale, it only perpetuates more evil. So I would just write in Bernie in the general if it came down to it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Libertarians aren't libertarians anymore though. Now a days they're just re-branded Tea Partiers. Real libertarians acknowledge the usefulness of government as long as it stays small and not intrusive. Libertarians now just wanna overthrow the government because a half-black man is in office. So if you vote down the line libertarian, just for lack of a better option, it could produce some pretty shitty results. So get to know your local independent candidates. You might have a lot in common with some of them. Either way, this starts local. Know your local politicians personally and what they stand for in order to get the right people in office. That's how you get your vote to count. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am an individual that is not affiliated with any party. I say far left because it's easier for people to understand what I mean when I say that, having never met someone. I am obviously against all the NSA bullshit. I am for universal healthcare, marriage equality, tax hikes for the wealthy and most other things on a "socialists" agenda. I am simply stating that even though I hate what our government is, I understand that aspects of government are essential for the population. And that there is no-one that I would cast a vote for other than Bernie because everyone else is just evil like always. I'm also not naive to think the Bernie would have a huge impact as president since the problem starts locally. We need to get the right people in office at the local level to change anything but at least it would be a start in a positive direction. Basically, I hate Obama a lot but not because he is black like some redneck asshole. I hate him because of all the fucked up deals he has made while people's backs were turned, worrying about Jenner's dick or what not, i.e. making Monsanto infallible, trying to push TPP forward, extending the patriot act, drones, defender of troops staying in the middle east to secure the opium trade, etc etc etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, I don't fully understand your question. Are you saying that because things have been shitty for the last 20 years how can I still be to the left since there's been a "democrat" in office the last 7 years? If so, if you didn't realize, Obama is a conservative (w/ moderate capabilities) republican. The right has become so far out there that moderate ones are misdiagnosed as a democrat. Don't get me wrong, I hate democrats and republicans alike but I also realize that some government(not the current one for sure) is necessary, just as long as the boundaries aren't crossed(as we are way past that).  We are screwed until corporate money is gone from elections and we do away with the two party system. I don't know if this answers your question or not and if it didn't then simply put.... It's extremely easy to keep a far left stance at 33. And to answer the last question you had...my vote is with Bernie Sanders or no one. </TEXT>

My gf has always said that the rest of Arizona gives Tucson a bad name and after reading what all has taken place over the last decade or more, I can see why she says that. I am an avid fan of the outdoors and have been up Mt. Lemon once before. It is beautiful. What is the music scene here like? Is it like most southwestern cities or is there more of a independent feel here because of the college demographic?  I would guess scuz rock, people who used to love Sublime and still do, and the rest like Los Lobos. Hopefully I am wrong. Ha </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get that but if our country is to have any chance of being unfucked then we have to do away with the 2 party system. My point was that the republican brand name isn't what it used to be. It is now just a group of redness trying to out douche each other for profits. The democrats aren't much better. The government does nothing but throw polarizing issues at the masses in order to keep them arguing and distracted while the government slips out the back door and accepts deals that are detrimental to this country. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get in fight with my girlfriend all the time about this and it drives me crazy. She received the MMR vaccine in the Army then developed Chron's disease. The Army subsequently kicked her out for it. So she very adamant that vaccines fucked her up. I have argued the normal talking points as to why vaccines are essential but I am at a loss for words now. How do I explain better or have her come away from the dark side? It is very difficult to talk to her about this because it is something that will always negatively affect her and she sees it as the vaccine having a direct correlation between her and Chron's disease. </TEXT>
