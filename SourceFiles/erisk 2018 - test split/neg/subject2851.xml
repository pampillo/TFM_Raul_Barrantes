<TITLE> I Heard My Neighbour Talking </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 02:12:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know what you're all thinking "whoopie doodle, I hear my neighbours talking all the time"
but are there other people around when you hear them talking?    if there aren't, do you hear the other party responding?

I was home alone, it was a quiet tuesday evening.  I was killing time by playing stupid cell phone games.  Y'know, just a normal night.  But I was startled by a voice in the hallway, it was my neighbor across the hall talking to someone.

Now, my first thought was 'well, at least it's not me'.  Don't get me wrong, he's a nice guy, friendly, but oh my god can he talk your ear off!    being the anti-social introvert that I am, I tend to just keep to myself   try to avoid human contact whenever possible

But the more I thought about it, the weirder it got.  Cuntzilla upstairs was away on vacation,   the lady who lived above him worked until midnight.  I knew for a fact that we were the only 2 people currently in the building (it's a small, high security building)

I thought maybe the landlord was here, but a glance into the apartment told me that no, we really were the only people in this building.

Curiosity got the better of me, so I ninja'd my way to the door, a move I've perfected whenever I hear him   Cuntzilla talking (no, I'm not one of those old busybodies who has their nose in everyone's business - first off, I'm only 36.  Secondly, I just want to keep on top of what rumours she's spreading about me.  But that's not important right now)

Through my peephole, I have a perfect view of the foyer I share with him.  I saw him, facing one of the 2 exit doors,   talking to someone.  But the door was closed   no one was on this side of it.
Then I heard another voice, another male voice, reply to him.  The only men who live in this apartment building are my neighbour   my husband, so I KNOW it wasn't either of them.  

'They' continued to chat for another 5ish minutes about nothing overly important; weather, cars, the sort of thing you chat with an acquaintance with, before my neighbour says goodbye   heads out the other exit door.  I stand at my door, listening.  I hear my neighbour go up the stairs   leave, but I never hear anything from the other side of the door that he was talking to. 

I decide to grow some balls   investigate under the guise of doing laundry.  I grab my ever-present laundry basket full of dirty clothes   walk out the door, through the closed door,   into....
nothing.  Just the stairwell   laundry room.  I look under the stairs, glance into corners,   even go into the laundry room, but there is no one anywhere to be seen.  If he had left, I would have heard him.

I know this isn't that scary, but I'm pretty high strung   can usually tell just by sound alone what's going on in my building (it's not that there's thin walls, just that I'm hyper-aware of sounds   what they mean, annoyingly so) so as it gets darker   I'm home alone, I'm left wondering: who was that man?    where did he go? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This actually happened to me.  I still have the ring,   I wore it in the beginning,  long enough to have a reason to complain about something other than the appearance - it was a wide ring   I have sensitive skin, it was trapping sweat   other moisture   irritating my skin.

Luckily it was cheap (my husband knows not to buy me expensive things)   one day while we were browsing a pawn shop, a ring caught my eye   I told him that was the one I wanted.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I lost my virginity by rape when I was 14.  I think under different conditions it would have been LESS traumatic,  but it would still be traumatizing. 
It took me almost 20 years to deal with it   come to terms with what it,   the fallout from it did to me.
People didn't believe me, I didn't fully understand what had happened,    it did nothing to help my already-low self-esteem.  I spiraled downwards, having sex with guys who didn't care about me as a way to make myself feel wanted.   It didn't work.  For most of my life, sex had no intimacy for me, it was just another activity that I did with my SO, like bowling or watching a movie.

I don't know how to answer your question,  but I hope this gives you some insight.   If you have any questions,  feel free to ask, I'm surprisingly comfortable talking about this. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Dumpster Diving - A How To </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Originally posted on /r/frugal, it seems there's enough interest for me to post here as well  :D

I wrote this years ago, but it's still as useful now as it was then   it's getting to be that time of year, where it's cold enough to help keep the smells down :D

This is an awesome resource for all sorts of things   can be a fun hobby

I live in a small-ish town, so I'm not lucky enough to have very many dumpsters to dig through, but the ones I've found are practical goldmines. At one point, I was spending $50 a month to feed 3 adults because of the food I was finding

My main problem in my town is that all the big grocery stores have compactors. But there's other places that sell groceries

Although a lot of what I find is food, it's because I don't have a good selection of stores. I've been doing it for a few years,   thought I'd share some of the tips I've learned


Bring a flashlight. Seriously, as well-lit as some dumpsters are, you'll want a flashlight to shine around inside the dumpster. Along with this one, go at night. I usually don't go out until after midnight,   I try for Sunday nights, or weekdays, so there's less people to see me. I'm not ashamed, I just don't want other people catching on to the awesome hauls :D

The very best time to dumpster dive for food is the night before a holiday. If stores will be closed on Monday, they'll throw out anything that would go bad on Sunday.

Wear clothes you don't care about. They'll probably get dirty/rusty. They may get torn.

You really shouldn't get in the dumpsters. I've been known to break this rule, but it was a special circumstance (the dumpster was emptied daily,   I could see the bottom of the dumpster, so I knew I wouldn't step on something   break an ankle or any other surprises. I also took along a small stepstool so I could get in   out without hurting myself,   a friend to help in case I got into something I couldn't get out of). There are a lot of reasons to not get into a dumpster though,   the one I'm most concerned about is the fact that a half full dumpster is half full of unknown things - you put your foot down   you don't know what's under it. As soon as you put some weight on it, you could sink straight down to the bottom, scraping your leg against broken glass, or landing wrong   spraining your ankle. Most of the time, it's not worth it.

Don't act like you're doing something wrong. If someone sees you, don't worry about it. Know the laws in your area. In my area, if it's in a dumpster, it's considered no one's property   is free game. Police or security guards can ask me to leave the property, as technically I'm trespassing because the dumpster is on private property, but they can't do anything more provided I comply. I've only been approached by the cops once, I was behind a building, they saw me drive in,   when I said I was looking for boxes, they told me to be careful   left me alone.

Keep a log. I make a note of what days I go to each dumpster, how full each one is,   if I get anything out of it. The days   fullness give me a decent idea of when the dumpsters are emptied out, so I can plan my route without wasting time. The loot log is more for my own interest, but if I've been going to a dumpster for a few months   it NEVER pays out, I won't go out of my way to go to it on any sort of regular basis, although I never fully cut a dumpster out because you never know when you'll get an awesome haul

If it's locked, leave it. Check every so often, as sometimes someone will leave it unlocked, or sometimes they just stop locking it all together. If it looks locked (chain   a locked lock), double check - a lot of dumpsters I've thought were locked actually weren't. If there's a sign nearby that says 'no tresspassing', then that's your warning that the person who owns the property doesn't want people on it. It's probably not worth it

If you're looking for food, cold nights   winter nights are the best times. I've gotten ice cream out of a dumpster,   it was still fully frozen (  not melted   refrozen). That is why I have no problems eating other perishable foods I find, as long as the temperature has been fridge-cold (at least) for the last little while (the dumpster I actually get in is the one I like getting food out of, as I know it hasn't been in there for more than 24 hours) Non-perishable food is good any time of the year, provided the packaging hasn't been damaged in a way that would harm the food inside. Expiry dates on canned goods   whatnot... this will probably bring up some debate. Personally, I'd eat them, as long as they weren't well past their date (I got a LOT of pop out of one dumpster recently,   I can taste the difference between the expired stuff   the non expired stuff, but there's really nothing wrong with it). Hell, when I was younger   poorer, I had canned goods that were probably older than the stuff I was pulling out of the dumpster. But with food, use your own discretion. I realize not everyone is going to be comfortable eating food that was in a dumpster,   that's okay. I don't have a problem with it though,   I just want to share what I know :)

Don't look at dumpster diving as something you HAVE to do because you don't have money. Have fun with it! To me, it's like a treasure hunt. When I was young, I always wanted to be an archaeologist,   now I'm digging through the rubble to find the awesome stuff underneath that no one knows about! it's also helping the planet, as this stuff isn't going to the dump (the pop bottles are now going to get recycled instead of just thrown in the dumpster). It may not be much, but every little bit helps


Other things I've found in dumpsters: Webcams, clothing, hair products, printers/scanners, pens, post it notes, cash register, plastic storage containers, plates, books </TEXT>

<TEXT> Never asked permission, the laws where I live make it so i can help myself until asked to leave (provided there's no sign)
I would think that most businesses would frown on people digging around in their dumpsters,   probably lock them if they knew.  A lot of people aren't that courteous,   will leave a giant mess, plus there's the whole liability thing I imagine

I have anxiety, so I've never asked about unsellable goods, although I know some places that do that sort of thing, it's usually smaller stores (locally owned chain stores seem to be best)

Not as important as you'd think.  There were 3 good dumpsters within a 20 minute walk of my place,   I had a wheelie cart that I used for groceries,   I'd just drag it along with me on some nights.  Depends on where you live/what's near you </TEXT>

my bf   I went together, it's more fun with a friend, plus it's a peace of mind thing as well (personally, I wouldn't go alone, but I'm a 5'3" female, so it's not like I could even see into most dumpsters *LOL*)
It depends on where the dumpster is, but usually I'd park in front of the business I'm diving at,   just cart the stuff over (or if it's a large haul/something heavy, I'd put it to the side of the dumpster   just pull up to put it in the car, then leave)

Most dumpsters I only spent about 10 minutes at, but there was one (for an office supply store) that I'd crawl up on the side of it   dig for anywhere up to an hour.  As long as no one seems to be giving me the stink eye, I'd stay there rooting around  :D
There was no other business or residence facing it, so I felt comfortable hanging out there while I poked around. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I feel like I have no real reason to keep living.  Everything I've ever tried to do, I've failed at

I tried to be an artist.  I tried for over a decade,   I just couldn't hack it, I was never good enough to do anything with it
before that I tried to be a functioning adult with a 'real' job.  I was having nervous breakdowns   panic attacks

my panic attacks just got worse as I got older.  I'm on meds for anxiety but they only take the edge off, they don't help me function in the way I need to.

I've been in a number of relationships, that all are basically variants of the same relationship over   over. 
I got married in 2013, for probably the least romantic reason ever - basically to make sure that if anything happened, we'd be each other's proxy for emergencies

I live with my husband,   he supports me, but all we ever do is fight anymore   he doesn't love me (this isn't speculation, he actually told me this, he doesn't feel love)
the only time he ever wants me in his life is when things are going well, which they haven't been for a while as I'm not getting the emotional intimacy that I need,   I feel so very alone

we moved 1500km away from our hometown 2 years ago,   not like it would have mattered, as I didn't have any friends there   I don't have any friends here.  I'm anti-social   an introvert, so it's not like anyone would miss me if I was to kill myself

I'm not close to my parents, I'm an only child,   it'd probably be at least 6 months before anyone realized I was gone (I honestly doubt they'd ever find out, I talk to them MAYBE 3 times a year,   that was when my mom wasn't dying)

I just feel like I have nothing left to live for.  I'm a failure as a person, I can't be independent,   I can't depend on anyone to take care of me.  I don't see the point of going on


Although I'm also a chickenshit, so it's not like I'm in any danger of actually going through with anything.  I'll just cry   mope   do nothing, just like I've been doing for the past year. </TEXT>

THIS IS FUCKING NEWS TO ME, BECAUSE THE LAST THING YOU TOLD ME EARLIER WAS THAT IT WAS OVER

Also, you had 3 days off last week.  You still did nothing.

I. AM. DEPRESSED.  Some days are better than others, some days are worse.  Shit like this, or you not resolving anything or communicating with me, makes things worse.  Which means I barely have the motivation to get out of bed   cooking dinner means having to try to find space to work in the kitchen more often than not.


I WOULD be making more money, but seeing that I had to support us for an entire year just off of my art, I am still suffering burn out   had to switch what I was doing just to continue wanting to draw, I am not making nearly as much as I used to.

<TEXT> I don't care how long the argument lasts, it'd be nice to actually get one resolved
Technically, we've still got an unresolved one from about 3 days ago (I don't even remember what anymore, but I'm left with the feeling of something being unresolved because of it) </TEXT>

<TEXT> You had 4 glasses, 2 plates,   a bowl sitting in the living room yesterday.  I commented on it,   had to yell at you a couple hours later to get you to take them into the kitchen

How deluded do you have to be in order to think you're pretty good about cleaning up after yourself? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So you go out of your way to make me completely dependent on you, tell me you don't want me working outside the home, tell me you don't even want me making any decisions on my own, then decide to just dump me because you can't talk to me?

real fucking nice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You don't see how the depression could fit in.

REALLY???

Despite the fact that I tell you I'm depressed at least once a week?  Despite the fact that I'm unhappy with our relationship   the communication   your motivation?  Despite the fact that I'm still fighting a burn-out from the year we lived in a van   I had to do EVERYTHING?

YOU DON'T SEE HOW DEPRESSION COULD FIT IN???? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wifey dearest here.  I'd just like to clarify a few points that my husband seems to have overlooked

Before I even start: when we got together, I was very up front   clear about the fact that I didn't want children, I'm an artist,   I want to be a housewife.  I didn't lie, mislead, or anything,   he was okay with that.
Now, onto the actual issues:

One: I don't expect the house to be spotless.  I want him to do the dishes (he brings home containers with food   leaves them random non-sink places, so they stink to high heaven by the time they're found).  I used to do dishes, but I started making it his job as punishment because I shouldn't have to deal with this.

Two: The only other chores I expect him to do are laundry, empty out the garbage,   clean up after himself.  I shouldn't have to pick his clothes   anything he's gotten out in the last month up off the floor just so I can sweep (which i would do if there wasn't shit all over the floor)

Three: I'm not a neat freak.  I'd like it if our flat surfaces weren't totally cluttered with random crap,   I get pissed off at him because he just moves piles of junk from one flat surface to another.

Four: He has NEVER brought up 90% of this with me, despite me telling him that he needs to communicate with me   tell me what's wrong.  Apparently he'd rather share it with a million strangers on the internet than the woman he supposedly 'loves'.

Five: My husband neglected to mention that for a year, my art was the only real income we had, while he worked MAYBE 20 hours a MONTH.  His excuse?  "Depression"
Apparently this excuse is good enough for him but not good enough for me to not put dishes away a couple times a week.

Also, while he was only working 20 hours a month, he didn't chip in   help out extra around the 'house' (we were living in a camper van at the time), so I was still expected to do all my domestic duties on top of churning out as much art as I was physically capable of, just to keep us afloat.

Six:
He lost his credit card a couple weeks ago,   tore the house apart looking for it.  Bedroom is still in disarray.  Apparently it's my job to clean up the mess he makes whenever he's looking for something he lost.  I didn't sign up to be a fucking maid.


As for the online game, I wish I HAD done that since I'm being blamed anyway, but no, the internet just went slow last night.  Apparently I'm responsible for shitty bandwidth, not sure how useful a super power that's going to be, but whatever, better than nothing

Also, funny how he noticed me getting drunk but not me crying myself to sleep BEFORE getting drunk.  I'm quite sure I was equally loud both times.

Why did I go to LCBO?  Because he told me that the relationship was over   crying myself to sleep doesn't work, yet getting drunk   passing out works amazingly. (Also, he's either bullshitting about me not saying anything, or he just doesn't listen to me enough to remember, but I said a LOT to him after he broke it off.  I told him I was tired of feeling depressed, I was tired of how I was the one holding the relationship together,   how I just wanted to be happy.  Apparently that's not a word)

Where we're going?  I asked him why he doesn't care about me.  He also said he had 10 minutes before work.
Maybe if he'd actually TALK TO ME I wouldn't have to do this out of the blue when he has things to do.



I won't be checking back here.  The comments are much too hateful from people who only know my husband's misrepresented side of the story, but I figured I'd at least try to point out that no, this is not an accurate representation of what is actually going down.  Just an accurate representation of the problems he's created in his head to make it look like he's not responsible.


Also, I had a job for 2 months.  I was still expected to do everything I'm already expected to do around the house.    he didn't want me having the job. </TEXT>
