<TEXT> Hi guys! I have a friend visiting Oregon in a few weeks and I wanted to take him on a few hikes near Portland or on the coast. I know of the multnomah falls hike and plan to take him there but just wanted to know if there are any other hikes along the way. We're both in decent shape and can handle hikes that are more than 3 miles. We'd love to see nice falls and walk in a creek if need be. Thanks in advance for the suggestions!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The prescription has to be typed first, then processed through insurance, then checked for interactions/dose appropriateness/etc. by the pharmacist, then counted, then checked again by the pharmacist. 
Sometimes phone calls to the doctor's office or insurance company have to be made. Oh and this is on top of at least dozens of other prescriptions that are constantly coming in on the voicemail, fax machine, and electronically. If the medication is a C2, it gets pampered with an additional step or two.
So there you have it really.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on how shy he is on the spectrum of being shy. If a guy is too shy to approach me but will open up and tease me a little once we get a conversation going then that's fine. But if he still can't make eye contact or flirt back after we've been conversing for hours then that's no Bueno. Guys, We have to somehow get an idea that you're interested. what's the worst thing that could happen if you ask a girl out? She says no and you learn how to tweak your strategy attack next time.

On a side note, being slightly awkward is also very endearing, to me at least.  </TEXT>

So I got the locksmith to meet me at my place (dumb I know, but I was desperate at this point). Long story short, he started texting and harassing me afterwards (he got my number from the company he worked for) about going on a date with him and having movie nights. I still have uneasy thoughts going to bed every night.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get my schedule a week at a time, but it is scheduled out 2 weeks out. There are alost always last minute emergency shifts that they text/call me about (they're totally optional and usually overtime though). If I have any preferences, I let the scheduler know. For example, I don't really care about getting Saturday's and Sunday's off since I don't have a spouse or kids to spend time with. But I do like having at least 2 days off in a row so I can go somewhere if I want to  and he's been really good with accommodating so far. Hope this helps!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Totally! I think most people equate JCP with clothes for your mom or grandma but I don't think that's true at all. I think the quality isn't on par with Nordstrom or anything like that, but for the price, you can find some pretty nice things in my opinion. I get asked where I get my clothes and people are so surprised when I say JCP.
I like the Liz Claiborne and Worthington lines for business casual/conservative attire. I do like Joe Fresh and MNG too!

They also have *really* good clearance deals all the time. I've gotten some silk Joe Fresh blouses for $2 each, a few dresses for 97 cents (yeah, I know), and so many nice pencil skirts for $5 or so. And lastly, they always have the $10 off of $25 dollars (this weekend included) coupons, that's basically getting an extra 30-40% off your purchase if you try to buy $25-30.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You sir, deserve a husband of the year award! Please tell her a stranger thinks she looks awesome and she needs to flaunt what she's got!
I know you noted some of the stores she likes, but when I think conservative yet classy, I usually go to JCPenney's to be honest (I usually buy my pencil skirts and dresses here for school/work). Here are a few of my suggestions:

<TEXT> Hi everyone,
As the title indicates, I am planning to spend a few days in Denver and Rocky Mountains National Park during my roadtrip from Texas to Oregon.[route](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Amarillo,+TX/Rocky+Mountain+National+Park,+Colorado/Yellowstone+National+Park/Grand+Teton+National+Park,+Teton+County,+WY/Eugene,+OR/@39.4423258,-121.9369639,5z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m32!4m31!1m5!1m1!1s0x870148d4b245cf03:0xd0f3d11c6836d2af!2m2!1d-101.8312969!2d35.2219971!1m5!1m1!1s0x876979e4455903e9:0xfa27ee43a78e8217!2m2!1d-105.683639!2d40.342793!1m5!1m1!1s0x5351e55555555555:0xaca8f930348fe1bb!2m2!1d-110.588455!2d44.427963!1m5!1m1!1s0x5352519ec95d1ba9:0xa5a0b88ecc91a337!2m2!1d-110.681763!2d43.790428!1m5!1m1!1s0x54c119b0ac501919:0x57ec61894a43894d!2m2!1d-123.0867536!2d44.0520691!3e0)
I've done some reading on the world wide web but wanted to post here for additional insight on the following: weather and driving conditions in Denver and RMNP during this time, absolutely must dos in Denver (I'm a young professional in my mid 20s), camping tips in RMNP, trails to definitely hit up in the park, food recommendations, and anything else you want to mention to a visitor of the city and park.
Any information you can provide will be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance kind stranger! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally, I think taking practice PCAT tests and reading the prep book helped more than most of my classes did. That said, I would just take classes that are suggested in your degree audit as a sophomore (Microbiology, Genetics, Gen Chem, and basic Bio were all helpful for the test in my opionion).

In terms of GPA, it's really hard to say since admission is based on a number of factors: GPA, interview, extra curricular activities, etc.
Personally, I think anything under 3.0 or so is when you should start really worrying. As someone mentioned earlier, the PCAT does test your knowledge of the material somewhat, but it assesses your ability to take standardized tests more. So I would just try to do well in school of course, but also find a good prep book to review with and take as many practice tests as time allows.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I highly recommend waiting until the spring semester of your P4 year to buy a book. New drugs (and sometimes guidelines) come out all the time so if you buy one now, you probably won't have the latest information for the NAPLEX after you graduate and will have to buy a new one at that time or resort to your class notes. 

If you're asking about a book to help you focus on the important stuff in school, I still think it's overkill. I would just focus on what you're taught in your classes and that should be sufficient. I think most schools teach you stuff that they know will be on the NAPLEX exam with a fluff class every now and then.

<TEXT> Hi everyone,


As the title indicates, I am planning to spend a few days in Yellowstone during my solo roadtrip from Texas to Oregon [route](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Amarillo,+TX/Rocky+Mountain+National+Park,+Colorado/Yellowstone+National+Park/Grand+Teton+National+Park,+Teton+County,+WY/Eugene,+OR/@39.4423258,-121.9369639,5z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m32!4m31!1m5!1m1!1s0x870148d4b245cf03:0xd0f3d11c6836d2af!2m2!1d-101.8312969!2d35.2219971!1m5!1m1!1s0x876979e4455903e9:0xfa27ee43a78e8217!2m2!1d-105.683639!2d40.342793!1m5!1m1!1s0x5351e55555555555:0xaca8f930348fe1bb!2m2!1d-110.588455!2d44.427963!1m5!1m1!1s0x5352519ec95d1ba9:0xa5a0b88ecc91a337!2m2!1d-110.681763!2d43.790428!1m5!1m1!1s0x54c119b0ac501919:0x57ec61894a43894d!2m2!1d-123.0867536!2d44.0520691!3e0). 

I am writing to see if anyone can give me tips on where to camp, road conditions during this time, what to watch out for, things to definitely see, safety issues one might encounter while camping alone, and anything else you can think of. I'm also planning to do 2-3 nights in Grand Tetons as well, so anything you can tell me about that will be fabulous!

I've been camping before, but not alone and it was at campsites. I know the basics of camping but I'm in no means a true backpacker of any sort. I'm in shape, but probably can't run a half marathon at this given moment.

Any information you can provide will be greatly appreciated! :)
I'm super stoked for this trip!

-Try not to think about how stressed you are or everything on your to do list for the next day. Think relaxing thoughts, like dark chocolate covered almonds.

<TEXT> Hi guys and gals,

I'm moving to Eugene in June! I've done some combing through city-data and thought I would also give Reddit a try. I'm looking for either a studio or 1 bedroom apartment to rent for 1 person, preferably under $800/month. 

I'm not really picky in terms of the condition of the place as long as it's clean and safe (ie. no mold, no sketchy neighborhood, etc.). If you could point me in the direction of town I should avoid, that would be also great. Any information you can provide is greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

<TEXT> Same here, I've noticed that Target definitely favors newer talents. I know a PIC that was reprimanded for the pharmacy not doing well (it's not really hear fault though, lots of CVS's and Walgreens's around). She ended up quitting and they had to hire someone else, fresh out of school to be the PIC. 

I think for the most part, Target treats you better than Walgreens or CVS though. As for the interview, they really like to hear about teamwork, fun, fast, friendly, leadership, etc. They really like enthusiasm and perky people are definitely who they look for.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't really say how it will be in 4 years or so, but I'm guessing it will be more competitive. I think as long as you're willing to move just about anywhere, you'll be able to find a job. If you're hoping to get a job in a big city (ie. Boston, Seattle, etc.), then the chances are pretty slim. 

Most retail companies secure their employees in the fall semester. The undesirable locations will have openings year round though. In terms of hospital, it looks like they like interns who did rotations with them, you know someone who works there, or just get lucky and get your application in at the right time with the right people. This is what I've seen at least.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For retail, I think the best time was in October or November of last year. Our school had a career fair and a lot of my classmates got their offers that way or they were already in the system and just accepted offers from the companies they're already working for. I did have a friend who didn't match for a residency and scrambled for a job in April and May last year. He was able to get a job, but in a very undesirable area. 

As for hospital, I'm really not sure. I talked to some pharmacists who work at a hospital and they all say to apply as soon possible. But from what I've observed, most hospital openings aren't really open, they're hiring internally or students who are graduating in the area. Other hospitals are looking to fill the position ASAP so I'm not even sure if they consider P4's applications. I applied for a few hospital positions and got the same message, "we're looking for someone with experience". Oh and it seems everyone prefers a residency now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Greetings /r/hiking!

I will be moving to Oregon from Texas in May. I'm planning to squeeze in some camping and hiking along the way, with an estimate of 10-14 days for the entire trip. 
[Map!] (https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Dallas,+TX/Rocky+Mountain+National+Park/Yellowstone+National+Park,+WY/Grand+Teton+National+Park,+Teton+County,+WY/Portland,+OR/@38.9173664,-119.2393563,5z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m32!4m31!1m5!1m1!1s0x864c19f77b45974b:0xb9ec9ba4f647678f!2m2!1d-96.7969879!2d32.7766642!1m5!1m1!1s0x876979e4455903e9:0xfa27ee43a78e8217!2m2!1d-105.683639!2d40.342793!1m5!1m1!1s0x5351e55555555555:0xaca8f930348fe1bb!2m2!1d-110.588455!2d44.427963!1m5!1m1!1s0x5352519ec95d1ba9:0xa5a0b88ecc91a337!2m2!1d-110.681763!2d43.790428!1m5!1m1!1s0x54950b0b7da97427:0x1c36b9e6f6d18591!2m2!1d-122.6764816!2d45.5230622!3e0)

I have a few national parks I want to go to along the way, but welcome any suggestions on other places I need to stop at. I would also love to hear any tips you may have for solo hiking and camping (I'll be camping at campsites to ease the anxiety of my parents), especially food suggestions. My car will probably be stuffed so I will not be cooking anything while camping, just looking for quick things to put together to replenish the burned calories. 

A little more information about me: 24 year old in decent shape, I probably can't run a marathon, but have no trouble hiking a few miles uphill. I will be driving a Toyota Camry loaded with my life belongings so any insight regarding being me being able to make it through certain areas will be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance guys!

<TEXT> I camped at Elkmont campsite in GSMNP in May, you could hear the fast creek in the morning. I went in May and the water was cold, but still bearable for a short dip.

There's Kisatchie National Forest in central LA (might not be on the way though) that was decent to camp in. Not too many scenic hikes in my opinion, but it's not crowded and a nice place to get away to for a few days. 

Most of Louisiana itself will not be cold during that time of year, so pack shorts and tshirts to roam about in.

<TEXT> I've been to the park to hike, but never camped (live about 2 hours away). A few of my friends have camped at one of the campsites and really enjoyed it, they're both pretty inexperienced. There's also Palo Duro Canyon State Park that might be a bit more of a drive but has better landscape views in my opinion. 

Out in the canyon, the stars are pretty amazing. It's a nice park with buffalos and a pond, but in terms of hiking trails, there wasn't much. I think 1-2 nights will be sufficient. Just remember to wash your shoes off after you get back because if you don't, the red dirt stains. Hope that helps! </TEXT>

<TEXT> No problem at all! I do mean couchsurfing like the website (there are a couple of websites with the same concept, but I think couchsurfing has the most users as of now)! Couchsurfing has quite a few differences from staying in a hostel, some of which are: 
1) couchsurfing is free, although surfers will usually bring a present or treat their hosts to a meal or drinks)
2) couchsurfing is essentially crashing on a stranger's couch, which has a higher likelihood of being sketchy versus a hostel
3) You'll meet more tourists like yourself at a hostel versus meeting more locals (friends of the host) when you're couchsurfing. I've been to 2 house parties while couchsurfing.  

Since I'm still in school, I haven't had the funds to really do international traveling unfortunately. Most of my traveling has been in the states and Canada. 

I've never tried booking a tour, I guess I don't see the appeal in having a whole vacation planned out for me. Part of the fun is planning what you want to do and things you want to see in my opinion. My itineraries are usually pretty loose, meaning I don't have a whole day planned out by the hour. I usually plan out 1-2 places to eat and 1-2 things to see that I actually follow, the rest of the time I set out for interesting things that I come across. Everyone is different though, if you like being prepared with expert guidance, then booking a tour might be the way to go (will have to factor that into your budget though). If you are a person who likes to have a plan and follow through with it, then you can use different apps to plan out your day, complete with directions!

If you're looking to go on your first solo trip, I would suggest going in the states because you already know the language and if anything happens, contacting family and friends will be easier. I'm not an expert obviously, but if you have other questions, fire away and I'll see if I can answer them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey! I felt the same way when I started traveling on my own after I finished college (most of my friends were still in college or had other obligations). Although I'm not Matt, I thought I would tell you about my experiece.

I think as long as you are open to talking to locals and other travelers, you'll have a great time! I've found cheap transportation options, local hole-in-the-wall eestablishments, etc. just by talking to locals and fellow travelers. From my experience, the vast majority of people are open to talking to other people and are willing to help you out if you appear a bit lost. Besides being used to find lodging for the night, couchsurfing can also be used to ask locals for local places to hit up or to meet up with hosts in the area for a drink or a meal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah, I see that on flights all the time, a lot of people pull out their phones or laptop to avoid talking to the person sitting next to them. 

I recently took a flight back home to visit family, also flying on Southwest. I like to sit in the front so I stopped at the first partly filled row and asked a guy sitting near the aisle if I could sit by the window. I thanked him and would have striked up a conversation with him, however, his fixation on his iPad and phone made me decide to keep my mouth shut. Another guy came and sat between us. After he got situated, I made small talk and asked him why he was heading to New Orleans. We ended up talking for the duration of the flight (not too long, ~1.33 hours) about everything from food to social media. The time passed very quickly! We used our phones... to show each other pictures and to exchange phone numbers as we were leaving. 

TLDR: Don't let your technology devices hold you back from interacting with people.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get my clothes from a number of sources, depending on the occasion:
1) For business casual clothes, I usually go to Gap or Ann Taylor The Loft and shop their sale and clearance items. Gap oftentimes has things for an additional 50% off and The Loft has pieces for $2.88 or $4.88. I'm ~5'0 and petite, there's a brand at JCP that has a petite line that fits me well. I'll typically get pencil skirts and dressy tops from there, they have $10 off of $25 coupons all the time so each piece comes out to be like $5. 

2) For shoes, I'll go to Dillards and shop their really good sales (75% off, then an additional 40-50% off). 

3) For formals or special occasions, I'll head to Dillards or Dillards outlet center. There's not an outlet center near me, but I visit a city that has 2 locations so whenever I go there, I'll buy a couple of nice dresses that I know I will wear for a wedding or formal event. You can typically get dresses for $20, you just have to have time to sort through everything. It's sorted by size, not style. Ross, TJ Maxx, etc. also offer casual dresses that I'll buy once in a while. 

4) I buy undergarments from Victoria's Secret during their semi annual sales. PJs from Victoria's Secret, Dillards, and JCP. PJs are almost always on super sale for some reason.

Lastly, I've gotten a few random things at the thrift stores and yard sales. From my limited experience, I've noticed yard sales and thrift stores typically offer the same things. Things I've bought at thrift stores are: cardigans, sweaters, tshirts, and purses. I rarely see pants, skirts, dresses, shoes, and active wear that fit me so I get these items at normal stores.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I currently work at Target as an intern, I started in the summer of 2013 as part of their internship program. Their internship program (40 hours/week) is terrific, it incorporates a lot of leadership building days and there's actually an agenda for every week. I talked to my friends who interned for CVS and Walgreens and they said it was just like working as a tech 32-40 hours a week.

As for working as an intern during the school year (which I think is what you're referring to), it is just like working as a technician. The main difference I think between CVS, etc. and Target is that interns (as far as I know) cannot give vaccinations. In terms of customers, Target's customers are usually less demanding about their medications because they can go and look around (dangerous for them but profitable for the company). 

Target takes good care of their interns and reach out to them regarding placement after graduation. However, if you want to move to a desirable area (major cities such as Boston, Portland, etc.), you still have to interview and compete against many applicants and there is a decent chance you might not get that location. Basically, if you're willing to relocate, you pretty much will have an offer from them before graduation. I hope this helps! Feel free to send me an orange envelope if you have more questions about interviews or other questions about working conditions. 


Edit: Target feeds you often, so if food is a deciding factor, Target is the way to go!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello! 

We're not big party animals, but I personally like dancing and getting to know people (can't drink because I get hives afterwards that last for a few days, not a good idea if you're beaching during most days). 

I've read about the bus that goes from San Jose to PV, looks inexpensive and works with our schedule. I do have a question about seating area though, if you don't buy your tickets early enough, does that mean you're stuck standing for the rest of the trip? 

There was a rafting company that will pick you up from San Jose, take you rafting, then drop you at your place in Puerto Vierjo, have you heard anything about that?

If I were going by myself or with 1 other person, I would definitely stay at a hostels, they're so much fun and you get to meet all types of cool people! With a decent number of us going, we agreed it would just be just as economical to rent a house. Thank you for your input!

I'm super excited to walk and bike everywhere. The things you mentioned are things I was thinking of adding to our schedule, great minds think alike! Thanks man! </TEXT>

So my dad let the hamster out, confining her to the area of a hula hoop. He leaves to go cook something and comes back to no hamster inside the hula hoop circle, shrugs it off and said she'll come crawling out sooner or later. A few weeks later, I found a dead hamster under my bed while looking for the remote control.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No problem, I've toyed with the idea myself. Our school has a very clinical curriculum and strongly encourages everyone to pursue a residency after graduation. I considered it during my first 2 years, then decided during clerkships that if I do a residency and want to do clinical things, I would just go to medical school. Why waste time doing a residency if I ultimately want to be a doctor?

But honestly man, I would just float retail while applying for medical school. I don't think being in a PGY1 residency will help you that much in medical school. Don't add to the stress of applying to medical school by doing it while completing a residency, it doesn't make much sense in my opinion.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like everyone else already commented on, I think it is different for everyone. Some of my classmates have a background in business, engineering, or even art. They had to spend a lot more time studying the first few semesters to soak up all the basic sciences knowledge the majority of us learned while in undergrad. At our school, Biochemistry was the big bad wolf to defeat. During my first year, I had to study to get the grades that I wanted. However, I still had time to go on trips and surf the web a ton (look for jobs, internet shopping, signed up for sweepstakes) only because I got my BS in biochemistry so it was mostly a review. The second and third year were more challenging because it was more unfamiliar territory. In short, depends on your boyfriend's background and if he's good at memorizing. Most of pharmacy school requires you to memorize a ton of information. If you've had exposure to it before, then it will take less time to memorize it the second time. If it's your first time coming across the material, it might take more time to cram it in. 

It also depends on how much of a gunner your bf is. My classmates who have a spouse and kids really aren't looking to do a residency nor do they obsess about grades. So while they study while they are at school (usually until their kids get home or until labs end), they usually don't pull all nighters like their younger classmates who want to be in the top 5%. 


Personally, I still had a social life in Pharmacy school (except for a 1-2 blocks where I had a rotation in the ICU), but that's because I a) don't obsess about grades like I did in undergrad, A-B average is good enough for me b) I have a fairly decent background in the basic sciences c) I enjoy sleep, hanging out with friends, and traveling too much to give it up for an A+ D) I didn't have a boyfriend to set aside time for while in school so tons of time was saved there. I do have a sister who requires as much if not more time though so I guess it evens out, haha. Just keep in mind everyone is different and handles stress differently. I hope this helps! </TEXT>
