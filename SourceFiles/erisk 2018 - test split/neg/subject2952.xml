<TEXT> I believe this is about a British unit?

If that's the case then I would say no as I'm pretty sure it was an American unit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah its definitely not Zulu but I can see how you'd get there.

I'm almost certain it was an American unit holding the hill, so English voice acting. 

IIRC the enemies had a desert yellow uniform and I vaguely remember an emblem or a star on their helmets/hats.

I don't remember a great deal, hence why its so hard to find. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Can anyone help me find this movie? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been trying to find this movie for a while now but I can't remember what its called for the life of me.


What I know/think;

- War movie (Unsure of whether WW2, Vietnam or Korea)
- Produced in the US
- American Army in the pacific theater (Unsure if the adversaries are Vietnamese/Chinese/Japanese/Korean)
- They spend a lot of the movie holding a hill against the enemy
- I remember them blowing up some bridges also
- A relatively old film - I would say made between the 50'   70's
- I remember the landscape in the movie being quite sparse
- IIRC it was a color movie 


Any help appreciated! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've noticed a few times that some of the enemies mainly in the Giants husk are completely immune to damage.

This morning I found a Fallen Walker PE in Giants Husk, ran over to complete it to find that the Walkers legs were immune to damage. Not the whole Walker, just the legs. 

In the 4 minutes I had on the timer I managed to take off about 1/5th of its health.

Anyone else getting this?

<TEXT> It will make infusion quicker, but not that much quicker in reality considering you get 3-5 drops in a raid. Having to then infuse them into different pieces of gear will take a significant amount of time IMO.

Say you buy a 280/290 Zhalo Supercell from Xur, I dont know the maths but if you were to infuse a 320 primary into it you would need 2 or 3 to get it to max LL. Considering you may get 2-3 of these per week it would take a fair amount of time to fully infuse all the exotics/legendaries that you wanted to keep. Depending, of course, on how many you want. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Grimoire card for WoD states:

"Open a pocket in the universe, an impregnable fortress for you and your allies. The mighty Ward allows Guardians to hold key points and gather their strength in the face of overwhelming opposition."

I cannot count the amount of times I have used it in Crucible to be instantly broken by a Nova bomb or Golden Gun which then leads to a few of us being slaughtered. 

Then there is being killed by the blade dancers Psion-like arc wave through it. Not to mention the Psion's themselves! (Prison of Elders in particular)

Bungie can we please make WoD what it should always have been? Impregnable.

It wouldn't be OP IMO as we still cannot shoot out of it and it ultimately restricts the players inside it to the location it is placed meaning the opposition can wait for it to run out or run into it shotguns blazing still. 

Yes it would give those players a chance to cap an objective with very little chance of you taking it back straight away but this leaves you open to go and take another.

Thoughts? </TEXT>

<TEXT> allegedly they are going to make the TTK collectors edition extras (3x Exotic class items, 3x shaders, emotes etc.) available to people who have the original game, TDB   HOW. I read somewhere about it being a $20/20 fee to get the extras. Sounds like it was just digital items though, nothing physical. 

Assuming this is correct that would mean you can get the normal TTK and this package for a total of $60/60 minus the physical items.

I'll see if I can find the article I read and link it.

<TEXT> I've been thinking this for a while, almost all other games have something else to do besides just shooting/killing things EDIT - this includes punching/palming/knifing. I want some Destiny vices (EDIT I know these aren't all vices). For example;

- Casinos with common games we have today as well as new destiny gambling games - Bungie would probably need to increase glimmer cap for this - but you could have a new currency, casino tokens or something, which you could trade for varying levels of gear. e.g. 100 for a rare weapon, 1000 for a legendary, 10000 for an exotic.

- Sparrow racing, with betting on these races included.

- an exotic dancing club, showcasing all the best that the different races of exo/awoken/human have to offer - every guardian needs to unwind right? - maybe add a bar too with all the finest intergalactic beverages.
- A museum or something similar where you can get to grips with the lore of the destiny world without having to go on your laptop to read Grimoire cards
- a shooting range where you can go to test out all weapons and see what you think of them, perhaps whilst you are there all the perks for that weapon are activated temporarily to allow you to get a feel for what they will be like when upgraded or if you need to re-roll them.

Personally I would envisage these things to be in the city rather than the tower to try and give us a little more to explore as well other things to do. I'm sure we all have many more ideas than I have listed but it would be nice to do something else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In FFXIV: ARR (I know its completely different) they have a free company (clan) system which is great, you can rank up the clan to get perks such as bonus xp for doing day-to-day actions such as dungeons and raids. You can also set a clan emblem.

There is also clan housing where you build and customise your own house. Why not have something similar where you can purchase an area of the tower to customise yourself or have a clan ship that you can customise. If all six of your fireteam are clan members you can travel together in this "mother ship" in the loading screens. </TEXT>
