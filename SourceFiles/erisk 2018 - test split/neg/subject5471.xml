<TITLE> A few questions about reading "The Life of Samuel Johnson" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-08 07:12:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am going to start reading it this week and I had a few questions for those who have read it. 1. Does it require a lot of background information/notes to be understood or does Boswell assume the reader knows nothing in advance? 2. Is there a better unabridged version than the Penguin Classics and Everyman's Library versions? The Penguin copy has too small print but has notes and the Everyman's has good print size but no notes (from what I can tell). 3. Any tips for reading it? 

Thanks ahead of time  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I read Generation of Swine and Better than Sex (his 80's and 90's book respectively). They are good and I recommend reading them with the following things in mind. At that point in his life all the alcohol and drugs were starting to get to him, he began losing faith in politics, and he had problems with Rolling Stone.

<TEXT> I want to read The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge by Rilke but there are so many translations that and no good articles (besides one comparing Mitchell's and Pike's translations). I am wondering if anyone has read the new translations (Michael Hulse- Penguin Classics and Robert Vilain- Oxford World Classics) or the old ones (Mitchell- Vintage and Pike- Dalkey Archive) and can tell me which one is best. All I have heard is that Pike's is more accurate to the German but Mitchell's is more readable. Thanks ahead of time

<TEXT> I am currently reading P+V's The Brothers Karamazov. I am finding it a little daunting not so much because of the subject matter but more of the translation. The language seems beautiful in some parts and awkward in others. 
I have been reading a few subreddit posts about P+V and people seem to be split over them. Are they good translators? I know that is a vague question because translations are judged by accuracy to the original language, readability, etc. But I am curious if anyone else feels this way about them. Side Question: Are their translations of The Idiot and The Demons good?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't seen the movie but I have read the story. The story offers both an argument for determinism and free will when it comes to time. The aliens think in a way in which they know everything that will happen (maybe a nonlinear look at time). While the humans think in a linear way of looking at time. I guess you could say the aliens are determinists. But the story is more about how you think about life. It asks the question is it better to know what will happen in the future or rather to let time take its course and let the answers come gradually. If you think that life is determined than you might not act out of line. But if you believe in free will exists then you think you  are free and there is no scripted version of life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "I know myself but that is all"- from the end of TSOP. I still think about that quote a lot. I was reading TBAD when I visited Fitzgerald's grave. It is a bit boring compared to his other books. As I have said in another fitzgerald post, he is better to read in publication order. You can better see his growth as a writer if you read in order. Also the books are largely autobiographical so they are a nice timeline in his and Zelda's life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> With Non-fiction, if it is a book with an argument (like a philosophy treatise) then I do a lot of research on the book and its author before jumping in. I also take notes while reading. A side note on philosophy- it is better to start from the beginning (Plato and Aristotle) before trying to read the new guys. Often the new guys reference works from the past. If it is a general nonfiction book then I usually just read it normally.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the big lessons are (in no specific order) 1. You need to listen to both sides of a debate before picking a side. Even when you pick a side you need to not be dogmatic. 2. Pay attention to current events and don't think you are protected from everything because you are financially secure. 3. Time doesn't care about you. It continues on whether you like it or not. 4. Death is inevitable and sometimes it takes you almost dying (or being sick)to really appreciate life. Also one thing I liked was that Mann didn't pick a side when it comes to whether you should care more about the material world or the spiritual world- you have to make your own decision.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury
The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury
J.D. Salinger's are great (I think they should be read once and then read again after reading all 3 story books)
The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien (not exactly a short story collection, more of a novel comprised of individual stories)
Will You Please be Quiet, Please? By Raymond Carver (he is a god of short stories)
Flannery O'Connor is good from what I hear

I would not recommend David Foster Wallace's short stories (his essays are better)

Maybe even Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. You need to read The Odyssey and The Iliad to understand The Aeneid. And you need to read The Aeneid and The Bible to understand The Divine Comedy. You could also just dive in. The footnotes for Paradise Lost should help explain the influences.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel you struggle man. I have ADHD as well. Reading actually calms me down and allows me to not zone out as much. But what I would say helps (besides medicine) is reading for 30 minutes and every time you think a thought that you know you are going to zone out on, write it down and get back to reading. After the 30 minutes, look up or do what is on that list for 10 minutes. Then go back to reading. It works with the ADHD instead of against it. Hope this helps </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been reading the Barnes and Noble Classics Editions of different classics for my whole life. I started getting them as Christmas presents and now buy them because they are cheaper, have wonderful introductions, footnotes, and end notes. They also are aesthetically pleasing for the cover art is usually a beautiful painting. However, I have heard noticed while searching through "the best translation" discussions that a lot of the translations offered by the BN Classic Editions are either bad translations or are from centuries ago in which the text becomes more pretentious or clunky then it really is. Another thing I've noticed is the varying print sizes. This is weirdly important to me. I like normal to large size font which some of the editions offer while others have almost microscopic fonts. My final problem with the Editions Series as a whole is that they are inconsistent with author's work (probably because of copyright and publishing rights) or just do not have some wonderful authors. I'll continue buying them for the editions of English novels and stories but I'm wary for the translated texts. So what do you guys think about the BN Classics Editions?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Discussion: Short Books vs Long Books </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-30 03:54:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Over my reading career I have found that I have a preference for reading short books. But recently I have found myself reading longer books. There are perks to each. Short books are easier to read (and re-read) in terms of time spent, often pack a lot of emotion, plot development, etc in less pages, and feel better to finish more of them. However, longer books I feel are able to expand on themes, characters, etc, they also feel like a commitment, and also can pack a lot more in their pages by their lack of brevity. So what is subreddit community what do you think? What are your preferences and why? I'm looking forward to hearing the responses.   </TEXT>

Before I get hate, not everyone is a book buff like all of us so people do actually get surprised when there is a lesser known book that preceded a blockbuster movie.

<DATE> 2016-10-28 04:27:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This week, for some strange reason, I have become increasingly interested in postmodernist literature. I have heard the greats are Gaddis, Pynchon, Delilo, DFW, Gass, Eco, etc. I have read a bit of DFW's work (mainly his nonfiction; opinion- his nonfiction is much more interesting than his short fiction). I need help finding a starting place. Do any of you wonderful people know a good video series, lectures, or introductory books that help explain postmodernist literature? I also would love it if someone could recommend a good starting place with actual author's works. The authors I am interested in are mainly Pynchon and Gaddis (because I can not find a clear starting point for either). But I am also interested in other authors. I know the big red box staring at me is saying I can't ask for recommendations but have mercy upon me Reddit moderators. Thanks ahead of time all commenters.  </TEXT>

 Almost done with Swann's Way. I read 50 pages a day for the last week. I recommend the Lydia Davis Translation.

<TEXT> I agree with the Fagles translation advice. However I would recommend before reading to do a little research on The Odyssey. It is a "sequel" to the Iliad and there are a ton of references to events or characters in the Iliad. I would also recommend the Crash Course videos on The Odyssey. John Green is bae.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Up until this year I never reread a book. I felt that I understood a book enough the first time reading it, thus it would be pointless to waste the time reading it again. Then I decided to reread a few of the books I "read" for class in high school. I reread Catcher in the Rye and The Great Gatsby. Catcher in the Rye was a nice reread but because it had been 4 years since I was 15, relating to the "teen angst" was not there. I did feel the isolation feeling. The Great Gatsby was a huge disappointment. I had spent the year reading Fitzgerald's other novels. When I reread Gatsby the novel did not stand up to his other novels. It is a very overrated novel but is worth reading. I recommend everyone rereads their high school reading list. Your favorite or least favorite books may have a new effect on you the second time around.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just finished Lolita by Nabokov 10 minutes ago. As I read the 307th and final page I felt incredibly disappointed. I was bored throughout the whole book. The plot was kinda interesting mainly because the subject matter is insane. The prose was beautiful but it felt repetitive. The puns and witticism were nice but only a few managed to make me laugh as I did while reading Pnin. The French was nice at first but got annoying as it went on. Has anyone felt this way after finishing a book (maybe one that is "rated" so highly)?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hardcovers last longer but paperbacks will take a beating and are easier to carry around. I personally think paperbacks are easier to read from but hardcovers look cooler on a bookshelf. In the end, it's up to what you think looks nicer. I personally think some older paperbacks have much nicer cover and spine designs (especially the Bantem Books ones that made their cover art look like an old movie poster) than the hardcovers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My favorite is a tie between "Looking for Alaska" by John Green and "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" by Stephen Chbosky. I think both novels perfectly capture what it is like being a teenager and high school and the corresponding emotional roller coaster ride that is growing up. I have always felt that good young adult novels can make you feel the sublime ecstasy of being a highschooler again.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I printed out a few lists of the best books of all time/20th century/etc, compared them all, and marked which books were on multiple lists. But besides choosing from these lists, I usually just ask the nice people that work at bookstores. Most of the people that work in bookstores are well-read and can probably recommend something if you describe a type of book you want to read. The recommendations/lists on Goodreads.com also are pretty good for finding what you want to read.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Certain Book Binding/Print Preferences? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I am wondering if I am alone in my certain preferences when it comes to book bindings and print types. I really like when books are the white Bantam Book binding (for example https://www.google.com/search?q=bantam+book+paperback rlz=1CAACAG_enUS691US691 espv=2 biw=1366 bih=631 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ved=0ahUKEwi94OXHm9HOAhUDox4KHboeDMEQ_AUIBygC#tbm=isch q=bantam+book+paperback+hesse imgrc=E7PKy8KSm02BpM%3A). I also really like it when the print is larger and there are fewer words on a page. Also the Library of America hardcover editions are amazing. So, before I embarrass myself anymore... does anyone have these preferences and if so what are they?  </TEXT>

I used to lend any book I had to my friends.

Now I only lend books that I have already read to my friends.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read the book while going to school in DC. I agree with the mindblowing history of what DC used to be. For example, the area where his "rundown" apartment was is now an incredibly expensive area. I have read almost everything HST wrote and if you enjoy '72 then you will love The Gonzo Papers series. I just finished Better Than Sex (Gonzo Papers 4) and loved it. He talks a lot about the Clintons and gives his "interesting" opinion on Hillary. Stick with '72. It gets a little boring towards the end but the ending made me smile. It was also fitting that when I looked up from the last page, I saw the Washington Monument.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Over the last few months I have found myself becoming more and more interested in studying philosophy. I have run into some roadblocks of where to start. I have heard three ways of starting. 1. Start at the very beginning with the Greek Philosophers (i.e. Plato, Aristotle). 2. Start with the most accessible/most readable philosophy books. 3. Start with the most interesting philosophy books. I am wondering which of these paths I should follow. I am also curious as to which books are the easiest to start out with. Thank you for your suggestions ahead of time.

<TEXT> I will admit being an atheist used to make me sad. For most of my life I selfishly believed in an afterlife that would preserve my mind after death. Even when I was an agnostic, I still held onto this notion of the afterlife. But after doing some deep thinking and reading some books on atheism (notably "The God Delusion" and "God is not Great") I realized that the afterlife is a myth but that is not exactly as bad a thing as I thought it would be. I feel now that I have been lucky enough to be born and given a chance to experience life. While the ending is not pleasant, I know every moment leading up to it I will celebrating and enjoying life. Sometimes the end makes you enjoy the journey more.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> During my freshman year of college I re-read The Great Gatsby and The Catcher in the Rye. I have a good memory so I thought I was not going to enjoy them as well as I did when I was a sophomore in high school reading them. Upon re-reading I was shocked by how "different" they were from how I remembered them. I think everyone has this revelation of how much they have grown up when they re-do something they did years ago. Back to the books. The Great Gatsby fell in comparison to the other Fitzgerald novels I had read earlier in the year (namely This Side of Paradise). The Catcher in the Rye was interesting because its feelings of social isolation were still there but its general feel did not strike me as much as it used to.  </TEXT>
