<TEXT> The top is pepperoni and the bottom is turkey italian sausage and green peppers.

Backstory: I went gluten-free for a couple of months to find out if I had a sensitivity (sadly, I do). Pizza is my favourite food group so I was craving it constantly. I found a recipe for a crust made of just three types of cheese, eggs, and optional italian seasoning. It definitely hit the spot!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> After some advice from my last post and poking around old posts here, I invested in 2 StarBonds based on the info on Kaigee. I chose HMIRR and JSTAT, both adjusting on Tuesday and with DROI of 2.16 and 1.22 respectively. Their changes are green so I bought, not shorted.

I invested earlier in the week and if I'm understanding currently, I should have made some money off each daily. Instead, I'm at 0.00 net gain with HMIRR and I've lost $700 with JSTAT. 

Did I mess up my understanding of how SBs work?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I was viewing warrants incorrectly. I didn't quite know what the value was all about. For example, in my post, I mentioned I bought in at $17.xx. Now I am understanding that it means the movie had already made $17M over the strike price and finished at $19M over. There is no separate payout for "the warrant part" as I put it. The value will just keep gradually increasing until the 12 weeks is up.

I know that's old information and probably really obvious but I'm outting my dumb-dumb moment in case it helps another newbie!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Help understanding warrants </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-02 02:03:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm really new to HSX and I was advised to look into blockbuster warrants to make some free money. I bought 10,000 shares of Lego Batman at $17.59 and it just delisted at $19.69. Yay! 

But I'm wondering when the warrant part comes into play. I was paid for the system selling my stock for me, but when does the warrant cash out happen? Do they need to wait for official weekend numbers? Box Office Mojo said it made over $300M and with a strike price of $155M, that should mean each share earns $145, right? 

Or am I completely misunderstanding warrants? 

*Update:* It would have helped if I had read Mojo correctly. The film made $174M, not $300M. If I had realized this earlier, the numbers would have made sense much earlier! 174 - 155 = 19. And the light bulb turns on. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I use IT Cosmetics CC cream and the primers I've tried are Monistat anti-chafing gel and The Ordinary's High-Adherence primer. All of these items are silicone based. Does anyone know why the primers would be causing the CC cream to separate on my chin after about 3 hours? They also cause it to cake/crust in areas I usually don't have any issues. My makeup looks SO much better without primer.

I haven't tried a water based primer because I wanted the silicone to help fill in pores and acne-related texture issues.

ETA: Both primers also make me super shiny. Blotting papers can't keep up!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pigs in a blanket, crockpot sausages in bbq sauce, pizza dip, pizza pinwheels, etc.

But my ultimate suggestion is you take Club crackers, put a tsp of brown sugar on each one, and then wrap with a half slice of bacon. Bake them on low heat for an hour and they are like crack! You can put parmesan cheese instead of the sugar, but the sugar ones always disappear first when I make these. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I took physics in high school and we had to build a machine that could launch a squash ball a specific distance. It was a 2-day competition and your score would be averaged. You basically had to use your machine to throw the ball across a football field. You'd move the machine to where the ball landed and throw again. And again until your ball finally got to the finish line.

I had already been kicked out of my house and was living on my own with little funds to build anything substantial. Meanwhile, several of my classmates got together with at least one father who was an engineer and built several identical machines for the group.

After the first day of competition (where I did so very poorly), I asked the teacher what grade I would get if I sat out on the second day. He told me I'd get a 51%. I decided to compete on the second day despite being absolutely mortified at how awful it was going (it took me at least 5x as long to complete it). When our grades were posted, I ended up with a 49% ... LOWER than I would have gotten if I just sat out the second day completely!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The eyebrow cake powder duo. I love that it comes in grey/black which you don't see too often in western cosmetics, especially drugstore brands.

I also like the waterproof mascara top coat. When combined with an eyelid primer, it helps keep my mascara from smudging which I had a huge problem with before. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting! I hadn't heard of using that as a primer before. I'll definitely read more about it. Thanks! 

The trick is simply to use a light dusting of loose powder all over after you prime, and then apply your foundation as normal. It helps keep you matte for a lot longer. You can also use a bit of powder to set afterwards too. I usually just do a bit on my t-zone. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Drugstore pore filling primer </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-13 01:07:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm looking for a drugstore pore filling primer. It doesn't have to be mattefying as the Wayne Goss powder before foundation trick is working wonders. I just have large pores and also some cracks/lines on my chin that I think are caused by past acne.

I have sensitive, combo, acne-prone skin and I think I read that pore fillers tend to lead to breakouts? 

The only "primer" I have used in the past is the Monistat gel which made my t-zone very shiny in just an hour or two. I am much more matte without it.

Hoping someone has a suggestion for me!  </TEXT>

Also, I use twice the amount of moisturizer I would normally use before I do my makeup. So on a non-makeup day, I use 1 pump. On makeup days, I use 2 and let it set while I dry my hair. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Looking for a dupe of Maybelline One By One mascara </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-04 21:26:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> One By One was my HG mascara until it got discontinued a couple of years ago. I've been jumping around to different Maybelline formulas (this brand works the best for my lashes) but have yet to find a mascara + brush combo that even compares.

I'm looking for a dupe, preferably drugstore brand that has a waterproof version. I have the typical Asian lashes: straight, short, points down, hard to curl, sparse, light, blah. 

Right now I'm using Maybelline Lash Sensational (original pink tube) which is wet and goopy, despite being a few months old, but I can manage it decently by running an old One By One brush through it. I also use the Rocket one because I like that type of brush but I have to use like 5+ coats to get the coverage I want.

Hoping someone has a suggestion for me!  </TEXT>
