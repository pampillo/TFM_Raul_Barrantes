<TEXT> The problem is that theory can't in any way be construed as some kind of positive political programme. Theory starting with the frankfurt school takes some kind of aporia or fundamental negativity as the basis for social relations. I found the article humorous because it basically showed the disconnect between theory and every day life, and that's great because everything that matters is impractical.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  No. The idea that responsibility for smashing the Kyriarchy is one sided simply because the phrase toxic feminity doesn't exist is poor reasoning.

I'm not saying that, I'm talking about this particular domain and I'd replace the phrase 'toxic feminity' in place of 'heteronormativity'. I do think though that the phenomenon of toxic femininity - fetishising gendered lifestyle choices based ultimate in some kind of biological definition of sex - would be particularly useful. Even if as you say, SAHMs are setting boundaries within their relationships, surely this is a facade that gives the illusion of independence in what is ultimately a one-sided role? The success of Sex and the City, Desperate Housewives etc surely shows that a significant number of women aspire to this kind of lifestyle. I don't see many active attempt to by feminists to stigmatize what is clearly an anti-feminist lifestyle choice itself. Indeed, it seems to me that attempts to glamorize 'sex work' may in some ways be a false negation that provides the veneer of professionality to what is clearly a patriarchial role.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can't find a thing on Stoltenberg sorry. 

As for toxic femininity, I don't think it should be posited as somehow 'opposite' or obverse to masculinity. Doing this misses the whole queer dimensionality of gender and misrecognizes the essential nature of masculinity and femininity (I understand that this is up for debate but I'm a Lacanian and essentially see these two poles of gender as complementary rather than antithetical). I think though that women have to be the primary agents of feminist social change and to that extent there *should be* a disproportionate emphasis on toxic femininity which is something women can actually undo themselves. To that extent we should be asking people of all genders whether they're perpetuating hetronormativity in their behavior, not *just* sexism. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is using the phrase 'toxic masculinity' to describe a certain set of behaviours problematic? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-08 00:31:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The term 'toxic masculinity' is only ever really applied to men. It therefore casts men as active and women as passive in maintaining and dismantling kyriarchy when of cours women can also be complicit in encouraging these behaviors.  'Toxic masculinity' implies that such a thing as 'healthy masculinity' exists and is to be encouraged. Of course, such a thing is impossible because at its core, all masculinity is premised on the idea that men have an essential gender-based superiority to protect. It seems from my experience that toxic masculinity is enacted by men so that certain gender norms can be enforced against other men - it's about maintaining and purifying a certain idea of masculinity in a group and the negative effects against women are purely a side effect. In this way, whatever the social impact of toxic masculinity, Queer men are always direct losers, being forced to perform a certain role and erase their identity to maintain 'in group' status. The term 'heteronormativity' can be a bit academic, but why isn't an equivalent word should be used by feminists in order to actually unpack the performative aspects of violent gender based behaviour? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Indeed. I think there is though there can be an unneccessary level of abstraction to someone like Derrida. Dropping a word like 'differance' or 'always-already' can function as a sort of linguistic in-group signifier in the way that 'synergy' functions in corporate discourse or 'IED' functions in military discourse.  When we don't have any common cannon to identify ourselves by, I think theory can be a tempting way for academics to establish in-group out-group status. Obviously the term 'accessibility' is loathed by academics who tend to see it most urgently used by grant-making bodies, but I think there is a danger of chasing obscurantism for its own sake.  I was writing a paper on history and atheism and I felt writing about post-modernity was much easier addressing historically specific intellectual developments. I found it much easier using a language shared by pretty much all humanities departments than by independently learning to 'think with' unique historical discourse.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok so the problem with this idea that all that was once lived becomes mere representation is the fact that it misses a large performative component of late capitalism. Check out this [Jucero press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N51oiMv3IJw) which I think anyone would identity with the latest manifestation of silicon valley futurism. What seems to be up for sale are some very specific performative actions. The point isn't to conveniently taste some orange juice, it's to go through the japanese tea room-like motions - scanning the opening the box, scanning the QR, sending back the packaging - that the simple inscribe act of drinking juice as a revolutionary gesture toward toward the future. 

This proves to me that there can't be a spectacle without a supplement based in some kind of signified lived experience. After some kind of zero-point, people will start to realise that empty advertisements do not speak to them and they *must* return to a clearly identifiable physical  reality.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah but this is where things get confused. There's postmodern art and postmodern thought, which are critical responses to a form of late capitalism which I would describe "postmodernity" and then there's the cultural products that came from this regime without challenging it. More and more I see comment pieces in national papers blaming "postmodernism" for Trump/Brexit/the GFC. They would be correct if they identified say the Kendall Jenner Pepsi ad or the Emoji movie as manifestations of a larger ideological state apparatus which can in various ways be linked to these calamities. Yet it seems to me names like Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault and Judith Butler get thrown under the bus instead. It's similar to how Nietzsche didn't kill god, but gets blamed for secular relativism it in popular culture anyway.  </TEXT>

Feminism is for me fundamentally about re-imagining the very notion of Cartesian subjectivity. Through the Eucharist, the church offers to absolve us from our flesh and to become one in the body of Christ. It's a deeply deeply sexual act, which entails reimagining the very notion of capitalist/patriarchical desire.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not at all. Freud said that inhibition is the price of civilisation. To be a proper member of civic society in a liberal democracy, you have to be understand why your its wrong to call your neighbours 'thieving gypos' in public, you have to restrain yourself through education so that certain things become unthinkable and people from different backgrounds can coexist. Fascism is an incredibly permissive ideology, its about allow people to indulge themselves and to not have to think through their actions and their worldview. The price of course is a country where people lose their humanity and ability to collectively understand themselves, they define themselves entirely in terms of these negative individual freedoms.  There's no space for expression or creation, its a society held together by destructive hateful impulses that seeks to tear down everything with it and eventually itself. What we've effectively seen is the aestheticism of fascism itself - we've externalised this inner evil impulse that we all have to contend with, so that its come to bring about very specific mustache and swastika connotation wrapped in our own memories of WWII. </TEXT>

Genealogy is a pretty well established technique to do so. Passion still means an almost divine devotion to something - if you have a passion for say, pottery then you're willing to in some sense go beyond what would be expected of you and suffer your comforts for it. To be passionate, especially in the realm of interpersonal relationships is to be willing to suffer for another person. You have to let someone know if you're feel passionately about them, otherwise it becomes a gift that you desperately want to give but they don't want to receive and it blurs the entire relationship. In any case, it's not possible to maintain an honest relationship if you keep it under wraps.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah but if you're identifying the problem at that level, you have to problematize the idea of consent - can a man that strikes a woman be held totally liable if the entire interaction happened within the context of a society that promotes violence as a means to self-realization? If we're going to be deconstructionists we can't simply say 'no means no', we have to look at how 'no' pre-supposes that a 'yes' exists which can be taken to mean any number of things not necessarily in opposition to 'no' and the 'meaning' is a problematic concept in itself which entirely depends on the existence of certain truth regimes... It's ridiculous and inhumane to even start getting academic like this in the face of an obvious instance of injustice, we necessarily have to make some kind of affirmative statement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd largely agree with what you said but I'd have to contest this:

Calling gender a social construct is not a simplification, and its not unimportant. Its still epicly complicated and nuanced. I agree that gender is a huge part of how many people define themselves, but not everyone, and its not necessary. I cant define myself by my gender because it would do my head in, and I was only able to find peace once i stopped trying. 

The point of a social construct, I think isn't only about how people define themselves but it's also about how *we* define *each other*. If I know absolutely nothing about somebody then their gender-presentation is one of the only ways to be able to instantly relate with their life experience and recognize them as fully human. To say 'I don't see gender' is to be as obtuse as to say 'I don't see race'. Obviously there are plenty of other ways of identifying how to relate to someone but in a world set on tearing social life apart - it's one of the few ways for people to establish themselves as a member of society. For this reason, we need a *clear idea* of what gender actually is, so people can see beyond themselves and recognize the how we are all indeed inter-reliant on one another. Increasingly, at least in the petty-bourgeois circles I travel in, it seems that women are encouraged to have this conversation about what it means to be female whereas men are almost mostly excluded and thus turn to hateful spaces that will negatively engage with masculinity. This sub, and films like Moonlight are a good start  but we need to be way more expansive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The answer I think simply boils down to the profit incentive. 

I don't believe in drug legalisation because, subjected only to the market forces companies will find the crudest possible way to make money without any regard for the consequences. Regulating the market is about what defining what kinds of behaviours are socially permissible. If people have to 'go underground' to get substances then they are forced to consciously reject social teachings if they want to get high. If people are actively making the choice to degenerate like this then we can ask ourselves introspective questions about why we live in such a society that its own members would reject it and get enslaved by some substance.

<TEXT> Problem comes when we actually try and define love, language just doesn't capture it. It's much easier to talk about pain and suffering because it's something we have all felt whereas love is totally evasive. 

Indeed I think it's true to say that he only way to access love is through pain. There's almost a biological component to pain, it's satisfying to watch say a horror movie because it reduces someone to a mere body. Indeed I think part of the appeal of Christianity is the comedy of worshipping a pathetic man-god suffering in infinite pain. Have you ever had the experience of cringing at something so hard you have to hit yourself to take the mental anguish away? That's the Christian experience for me at least - seeing the pain of the world and knowing that it's all ephemera compared to the infinity of love. Love is something that's really quite irrational, its when the barrier between giving and receiving breaks down. If you've ever had a partner ask 'why do you love me?' You'll know it's a question that can never be fully answered - if I were to say 'your hair' or 'your laughter' it would never properly satisfy. The figure of Jesus is to me the only adequate way to reconcile love and language because his experience on the cross resonates with the absurdity of love and being alive. Because of this I think it's dangerous to simply say 'love is god' - as we're just conflated anything that can't be immediately explained with holiness, when the reality is that what we once thought was love wasn't actually true love. </TEXT>

It's not exactly like playing Pachelbel's Canon in D or beating an orangutan in a cage fight, its a fluid attribute rooted in choice and will. To say that someone is incapable of something like this is to suggest that they're not fully human. Granted, what something like courage might look like depends entirely on the situation and I'd deter people making negative judgements - but if every man knows that what takes guts and sacrifice to do is usually the right thing  then I can only see the world getting better. 

 And just because someone is trans doesn't mean they have to uphold standards of the gender they identify with.

How can they identify with that gender if they don't feel compelled to uphold any values that define that gender? The only way I can this working out is by reducing the entire concept of gender to see aesthetic or biological preference, that I think is innately anti-LGBT.

 I don't think trans people need these ideological objective ideals of gender in order to pass or to know how to live their life. They are just like cis people in that we all have to figure out what our gender means for us and having some ideal forced upon us is unhealthy for everyone but the lucky few where that cookie cutter mold already fits perfectly.

Just as a technical point of clarification, these aren't objective ideals, they're intersubjective ideals rooted in an aporia of essential manliness. The cyncic in me says that this idea that people know who they really are deep down is rooted in a innately modernist/cartestian bias that fits deeply into neoliberal behaviourist choice theory. Ask any trans person and they'll tell you that they didn't choose to be trans, a gender that exists in this realm of the imaginary ideals chose them. What I'm saying here is that it's not enough to simply write off things like this as a being  'social constructs' and thus unimportant, we literally have nothing else to define ourselves by. The point isn't to destroy masculinity, it's to define consciously work to define masculinity in a positive way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If my neighbour bought a knife from a supermarket, would Sainsburys be held accountable if he stabbed me? Headshop owners knew they were selling a highly addictive substance and they had the cover of a big warning on the packet saying 'not for human consumption'. There's no way they were accountable before the psychoactive substances bill. 

Sorry but there's no way on earth that publicly stigmatising it and forcing people to go underground to get it directly caused an uptick in usage. Heck I'm in Manchester city centre right now and I'm pretty sure the problem is rooted in larger social issues. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok I have to out myself as a doubting Thomas. I've accepted that God exists in my spiritual journey, I've accepted major social teachings from the bible, I go to church and try to meet with the local priest every week, I've accepted the necessity of the figure of Christ so that man can live in the image of God and I do indeed try to address Jesus when I'm praying. I *want* to believe but in the deepest part of my heart I can't bring myself to accept miracles at face value. I'm probably with [Zizek](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=video cd=1 cad=rja uact=8 ved=0ahUKEwjC75uljpjTAhWKCcAKHeApAb4QtwIIGjAA url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DtABnznhzdIY usg=AFQjCNHgmUJTKp9hLk54sw3T3tlQ_DVywA sig2=Jmq2JG8SJZYu5evxCLeGLw) at the moment in believing that, Christ stopped believing in the Father on the cross and the people that 'saw' Jesus during the resurrection merely experienced some kind of intense hallucinatory fidelity to truth-event of the crucifixion. I know that faith isn't something I can intellectualize but without being convinced that Jesus literally rose from the dead my prayers just don't work. Any help would be appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd compare it to a set of competencies - there's no single way to show you're a 'team player' or you're 'courageous' or 'assertive' but these are pretty distinct traits even if the precise way they have are articulated is culturally influenced. Modern feminism seems to refuse to engage with the idea that such a thing a model for bare subjectivity exists - there is no such thing as a 'man', there are only 'black men', 'queer men', 'disabled men' and those subcategories can further be divided so that everyone simply exists in their individuation. This might make sense when you're defining a concept through language but it does not accord with real people's experience of being in the world. For this reason it's important that clear ideals are upheld and maintained - so that men/women/trans people have some kind of reference point when discussing how one should live life. By extension, this means that to say that some trans men might be incapable of a trait like courage would mean that we'd have to fall back on a strictly biological definition of gender.
It seems to me that women are able to maintain positive-sum relationships in a way that men aren't precisely because a feminine-ideal exists harmonious to social order which is constantly being curated through womens magazines, movies, instagram etc. A masculine ideal of this sort is desperately needed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree. Gender is vital to self-conception and your experience of the world. If you don't believe me, ask any trans person how important 'passing' as their non-assigned gender is to them. The task is to construct a form of distinctly positive masculinity that puts typical virtues like courage, loyalty and leadership while deconstructing some of the more negative traits--allowing space for men to be vulnerable and talking about their experience of manhood. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Under neoliberalism, we've witnessed a rise of what Tariq Ali calls the 'extreme centre' - massive cross-party convergence of over first principles political/economic issues. 'The left' (in as far as it's possible to put mass movements fighting for social justice together) has really been relegated to the role of the church in early modern societies ie a voice of moral authority in the public domain. Since the left is infinitely split and can't really agree over first principles (ie questions like 'is there such a thing as universal subjectivity?') it really does make sense to me for the Church to play a more active role in politics. I think the idea of 'wokeness' (ie being aware of insurmountable suffering in the world) is a key starting block to bringing the left and the church under the same banner but obviously there's a lot of points of divergence the left will have to work through.  </TEXT>

Are you kidding? Books like Beyond the Double blackmail are 150 pages, double spaced and extremely light on theory. Look at his public appearances and even his cultural references! He's clearly trying to make psychoanalysis and german idealism publicly accessible. To start philosophy by reading Greek texts seems plainly ridiculous to me. For me, I caught a few of Zizek's interviews then watched his lectures, read his articles, eventually his books - realised he was drawing from Lacan so picked up some Fink, took a class on Freud, Bought Ecrits, Read a few seminars that interested me, listened to a bunch of audiobooks on Hegel, took a general philosophy course and now I'm relatively confident that I understand the theoretical premise that Zizek is conveying through plastic terminology.  </TEXT>

I'm sure I've read it in some theoretical texts before: I think Zizek genders 'western'and the 'eastern' subjectivity along Lacanian lines but the implication here is that autheoritarian capitalism will always remain an irreconcilable fantasy for liberal policy makers that would require a complete overhaul in the religio-social historical sense of subjectivity in the West.

<TEXT> Because Utopian ideals have also lead to terrible crimes and dystopias. All the biggest crimes were committed for "worthy" reasons. I'm not against a degree of idealism but it needs to acknowledge how and why things as they are.

Isn't our current political configuration a utopian ideal? If you look at the images about the future presented to us by advertising firms, silicon valley, political parties then we seem resolutely attached to the notion that things will only get better; when the reality is that we're fully aware how [we're heading for environmental crises.](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v39/n05/benjamin-kunkel/the-capitalocene)

You don't think there is a thing called British culture? I don't think it's possible to be a socially functioning person and not have a culture.

I don't think it's possible to isolate 'British' culture as unique. It's a bit tedious but I remember when people used to have posters that said "Being British is about driving a German car to an Irish pub for a Belgian beer, then traveling home, grabbing an Indian curry or a Turkish kebab on the way, to sit on Swedish furniture and watch American shows on a Japanese TV" before the internet and the form of hyper-globalisation we have now. 

 Which is a modern Western liberal notion, right?

Western, I'd even venture to say *Christian* but not specifically British.

 Do you mean if a British culture exists it is actually magically in everyone in the world? Where are you going with this?

I don't think that culture is oriented around an arbitrary conception of space confined to"the British Isles". Peter Sloterdijk compares it to a translucent dome where some people are inside (most of Europe, most of America, upper-middle classes in the developing world) and some people are outside (refugees, most of the global south, people in extreme poverty). It's possible to see the inside from the outside but we on the inside compartmentalise the outsiders imagine that fictional communities like borders are really what divide us.

<TEXT>  That sounds a bit naive Utopian no?

Yes but what's wrong with trying to live up to utopian ideals? We've done so for most of our history.

 I just think we could emphasis materialism less. All this self made man idolatry seems like Ayn Rand myth making. Even a myth of self made culture. People come from a community not out of the ground. They all have specific cultures. Humans are social animals not single cell creatures.

It's not even about materialism any more though. In 10 years most of our interaction with capitalism will come through buying 'experiences', renting through airbnb, uber etc and desperately trying to gain reputation and influence ala the Nosedive episode of Black Mirror. It's an economy for sure but it cuts beneath the material into our deepest sense of desperation. 

 People come from a community not out of the ground

Yes but what community exists anymore in these post-industrial towns? Churches are crumbling, public space is being sold off, schools are becoming academies, councils are losing power, pubs are going bankrupt, jobs are becoming more insecure. There just isn't a sense of history in these places or collective belonging in the affirmative. If any sense of solidarity exists its a sense of interpassivity, based entirely on mutual rejection of the foreign other. That's an objectively pathetic way of organizing a community.

 Nationalism as a term here is just a stand in for ethnocentrism. I think saying any distinct ethnic group is held together by fear and hatred is inaccurate. All cultures have traditions, politics and norms. It's just part of how humans function as animals. That isn't distinct to British people. A person cannot be universal.

And what exactly would "british culture" be? Michael Gove's idea that we can instill British values in schools proved to be extremely pithy. Ask your average Brexit voter what year the magna carta was signed or what our most common tree is and they'd have no idea.  That plus the fact that historically we've been subjugated under divine rule - I study history and believe me there's nothing to be proud of looking backward. Fact is that if a culture exists today its global culture - go to hackney and you'll see people from all around living together under a sort of all encompassing natural religion. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  You shouldn't judge people by their ethnicity you should judge them by which university they went to, what house they live in and how much they earn. Globalist libertarian consumerist materialism?

Maybe we shouldn't judge people at all? If the only choice is either a) judge someone on something they could have said to have 'earned' if we're going to accept that at least some meritocracy exists (a good degree, a nice house etc) b) judge people based on something they were clearly born with and did nothing to earn - then I know what I'd prefer. 


 A sense of community, belonging and a group identity leads to more empathy and compassion. Outsiders help each other less. That's a pretty reliable rule.
 
That's not true. I think nationalist communities are tied together by fear and hatred, particularly the relationship of the nation to other nations. Native Brits need foreigners to build their own sense of identity, yet if we're going to forge a community based on excluding foreigners, any sense of solidarity we build is not actually about *us*, its about not being *them*.  </TEXT>

Yes. That's how politics is meant to work. Almost everyone that voted for her selectively consumed media of her public appearances and almost everyone that voted for her never actually met her. 

All we have are the words and images that we're presented with - and those words didn't seem to be rooted in any notion of reality as understood by ordinary americans. 

 The time to take serious stock was BEFORE we elected someone who is categorically worse than Hillary unless your assumptions about her include the aforementioned "shes a witch" conspiracy theory.

Reagan was a ridiculous charactuer of a man. So was Bush. I really just think Trump is the latest in a line of parochial fuck-you politicians. He's the physical embodiment of a society that's reached beyond itself, first as tragedy and now as farce. Yet the Clintons and the Democratic establishment that Hillary represented was willing to accompany the Republicans all along the way. Obama symbolised hope and optimisim - the notion that things can improve - but its not enough to be a symbol, a *fundamental* reconfiguration of the way politics is done had needed to take place. If Trump came after Obama then I'm sorry but should I don't even want to suggest who might have came after Hillary had she won.  </TEXT>

The way the word 'free speech' is constantly banded as a pejorative around seems extremely suspicious to me, as does the way the word 'fascist' is over-used to the extent that it loses any possible corollary with reality. I'm all in favor of 'decolonize campus' movements problematising the parts of Kant, Hegel, Freud etc that highlight the imperalism implicit in the parts logic of modern philosophy but only to the extent that the rest of these key works aren't also thrown out.

I don't think it's right to compare a substance that really helps groups of people alleviate social awkwardness in controllable dosages with other drugs. The study you cited is based on data almost 100 years old and in America; its not indicative of much and I think banning something is completely different to legalising something. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think we have to ask the question why would someone take  drugs?

The answer I think has to do with escaping reality - either the reality of their depressing lives or the reality of a repressive society. In either case, its a quick substitute, not an answer to their problems. 

Will education help them? I think most people are pretty educated about the fact that drugs are bad. I think part of the urge to use comes from a desire to subvert a society that constantly tells us to keep our minds and bodies healthy. Education in this way isn't going to help unless scare tactics are used, which could easily be proven wrong through google etc. Non-legality is the only moral arbiter we have in a post-religious society, it functions so people know either "I'm wrong for taking this substance" or "society is wrong to make it illegal". When you make drugs legal, you take away their right to choose whether to do something bad or not, thus defeating the entire point of drugs in the first place.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok so you're assuming:
 
1) That the money would be spent on the NHS.

2) Legalising drugs won't increase drug use. Right now it's pretty hard to get heroin etc if you don't already travel in circles where drug use is common. Make drugs publicly available and I'm sure we'll have plenty more of irresponsible idiots who taking too much and getting sent to hospital. 

3) There won't be a black market. If the government are going to put a tax drugs, why would users stop going to their cheaper old dealers?

<TEXT>  The sorts of people that will take drugs in excess following legalisation are either already binge drinking or already taking the same drugs illegally

Yes well isn't it worse that people who have been already been made vulnerable by substances will be hurt even more? Often these people come from already marginal groups homeless/trans/poor/mentally ill/ethnic minorities etc

 If anything people might move from alcohol to less harmful drugs and reduce the NHS strain

Which drugs would these be? 

Regardless, if legalised drugs are taxed properly then drug users can effectively pay for their own treatment.

Is that how it works? How much tax revenue comes would come from an individual meth user vs the cost of surgery, therapy etc? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look mate this is actually the subject of my MA thesis. Looking at your post history, most leftists wouldn't give you the time of day let alone an explanation into something that cuts across personal lines like this but I'll try and hash it out for you again anyway. 

Germany was the quintessential modern state. In the same way that Henry Ford used the production line to make cars, Himmler used the production line as an instrument of murder. *Gasenwagens*, mobile killing units involved widespread cooperation from industrialists, town planners, workers, all members of society. 

This is just one example of the innumerable horrors of holocaust to show hegemonic western capitalism that moral/social progress does not follow scientific progress in what was supposedly one of the most advanced countries in the world deemed to be beyond this. This was attested to at Nuremburg and has become the basis of international order, philosophy and art since the WWII. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The historical particulars of the Event itself are irrelevant. We agree here that modernity is not antithetical to barbarism as pre-holocaust thinkers Marx, Freud, Hegel etc supposed. Modernity, instrumental reason convert physical violence into structural violence through bureaucracy, medicalisation and whatnot. This is the truth, *the Real* of our society and its important that we're cognisant of it if we are to maintain our humanity and not descend into totalitarianism. 

The Holocaust acted as what Lacan would call *le point du capiton*, it came to symbolically manifest the rupture of this violence in the public conscience. Yes, under communism we will be able to realise the incontingency of these events and ascribe no deeper meaning to material events like this. But as it stands, the Holocaust is one of the only incontrovertible reminders of horrors we can unleash upon ourselves in a way the Armenian Genocide or Soviet Internments cannot. Spencer wants to delegitimise the primacy of the Holocaust in the pubic mind because he has at least some sympathy with the Nazis. For this reason, we should save Holocaust memory from people like him.  </TEXT>

Regardless, the Holocaust has taken the symbolic role of demonstrating a fundamental truth. It's important that we accept this because if we argue whether the Holocaust was indeed this tipping point what we're actually doing is masking the truth of modernity.  </TEXT>

That is to say that the Holocaust represented the eclipse of modernity as Adorno, Agamben, Ardent etc have shown. It showed us that technological progress does not go hand in hand with moral progress. It showed us that we are imperfect, we are not gods, we need moral limits.

<TEXT>  You might be right but I assume Uber drivers could form their own union as well. I honestly haven't thought about it.

I would be extremely interested in this. Under normal circumstances, an employer would provide the capital (cars) and workers would provide labor (car driving) but in this instance the only capital that Uber provides is a web platform that's costs very little to maintain. I'd like to city cities like New York legislate to kick out these types of private services and run their own version of Uber instead. Profits would go to the city itself and data could be used to improve the running of running of public services. Paul Mason talks about this in his book [Post Capitalism](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/PostCapitalism-Guide-Future-Paul-Mason/1846147387). 

 The Taxi Unions tell their drivers to strike and then they have to strike. If Taxi drivers don't strike, they get pressured by the union and potentially kicked out. It's not a free choice of individuals. 

Yeah but they can still continue to work for Taxi companies.  </TEXT>

No I want to destroy Uber, as you said their entire business model prevents workers from standing up for their interests. They are effectively modern day purveyors of slave labor. 


 The Taxi Unions didn't say lets do this out of "love, feels, etc", they did it because the president's policy is a threat to their organisation / workers.

Not all taxi drivers are immigrants yet they collectively decided to take a stand against Trump, so you can't just go on about rational choice theory. The entire ethos of the union movement is love "an injury to one is an injury to all".  </TEXT>

Companies like Starbucks and RED have even made our guilt about these issues a commodity by 'donating $1 to congolese women' or whatever for every x products sold. 

The good news is that capitalism HAS to collapse unless it destroys every living being on earth first. If alienation is a commodity in itself, we will eventually come to a point where people will just stop participating.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He put her in a hard spot, but here's what she should have said:

Comedy is inter-subjective, it's a social reflex, it stops us from taking ourselves too serious, it's a collective sight of relief at the banality of every day life. Comedians have an important public role in this way, people look towards them to see what kind of behavior is normal and what isn't. To be able to laugh with someone is to recognize them as a person like you. Jerry Seinfield should have been more aware of the fact that his work is going to have social consequences. To sit back and say 'what's funny is funny' isn't enough, he doesn't fully own his material - it depends on some shared understanding with the audience and when you're filming a TV series you have to have be aware of who you are unconsciously projecting your audience as. Women and black people have different life experiences to white men and so by making some effort to include these people as your guests, you open yourself and your audience up to humor in different life experiences.  </TEXT>

In any libidinal economy, there's always a redoubling--male peacocks have famously beautiful feathers so as to show a mate "I'm so healthy, I can 'spend' my energy on something so pointless". While this is a mating ritual for animals, the place of the symbolic realm in humans makes this notion of excess an end in itself rather than a means to something greater: take for instance our fixation with diamonds, which are completely pointless but still seen as a desirable end in themselves. The pursuit of this empty signifies is really the pursuit of the death drive in itself which links to what /u/Tsui_pen said </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure. The fact it's been adopted by the culture industry is indicative of an under underlying ethic that, followed to its conclusions would not lead to any kind of real social critique. 

And yes that's my point exactly. Let me use an example from Walter Benjamin's [Thesis on the Philosophy of History](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/benjamin/1940/history.htm) to illustrate it:

 It is well-known that an automaton once existed, which was so constructed that it could counter any move of a chess-player with a counter-move, and thereby assure itself of victory in the match. A puppet in Turkish attire, water-pipe in mouth, sat before the chessboard, which rested on a broad table. Through a system of mirrors, the illusion was created that this table was transparent from all sides. In truth, a hunchbacked dwarf who was a master chess-player sat inside, controlling the hands of the puppet with strings. One can envision a corresponding object to this apparatus in philosophy. The puppet called historical materialism is always supposed to win. It can do this with no further ado against any opponent, so long as it employs the services of theology, which as everyone knows is small and ugly and must be kept out of sight.

Under secular post-modernity, we should swap "Historical materialism"  and "theology". [Dupuy explains](http://msupress.org/books/book/?id=50-1D0-3448#.WHEG8ly33IU) that late-capitalism effectively takes the role of an unchangeable Absolute (ie theology), it's hidden away yet fundamentally constitutive of our society - so much so that it's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of Capitalism. Theology - the puppet could be conceived of as received social doctrine - ie patriarchy/kierarchy. Yes these things are bad but they're merely a symptom of a category of material life that needs to create *Others* in order to function. 

So what I'm saying is that so-called 'Liberal Feminism' is an attempt to dismantle the Master's house with the Master's tools. All we get is more atomisation and alienation as we reify the neo-liberal subject as default.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't think of any two figures more at odds than Zizek and Sam Harris. He's said before that he [hates Sam Harris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObnBHMzIQ_A). Even at his very best, his neurological understanding of the mind resists the idea that an unconsciousness exists which is the key insight of psychoanalysis. In terms of religion, Zizek identifies as a Christian-Atheist, whereas I'd say that Sam Harris is an Atheist-Christian in the sense that he's imbibed Christian doctrine and to an extent believes in the Absolute but refuses to label it god. 

The problem with Zizek is that he's always addressing two different sets of people as he speaks. To your average viewer, he seems to spit firing nonsense, dirty jokes etc paired with the occasional counter intuitive insight. To people who have read Marx/Hegel/Freud/Althusser/Lacan he's doing something much more sophisticated. 

If he were to comment on Joe Rogan, I think he'd make a point about how liberal permissiveness is really a form of internalised discipline. He claims to be a hedonist and have a sort of legalise pot/anti-dogmatic politics but he's also goes to obsessive lengths in his fitness/dietary routine. As for psychedelics, I think he'd say that they faciliate an encounter with the Real (that is reality unconstituted by language or the imagination) but the doctrine of 'look into yourself to find the truth' which its attached to is bogus neoliberal ideology - we should be trying to experiencing ourselves as truly passive beings, by looking to the way Others see the world.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The 'real problem here' clearly has to do with how some people are clearly still confused about the status of homosexuality in our society. The shooter had visited Pulse at least a dozen times and had downloaded the Jack'd app on his phone. His father hated homosexuality but he was extremely confused as he was gay himself. It seems to me he displaced this confusion as hatred by targeting a gay night club  so as to show the world his inner conflict as dramatically as possible and then claimed to be acting on behalf of ISIS for maximum shock value.

How do we stop this from ever happening again? Accept LBTQ+ people as ordinary citizens, repudiate this discourse that holds terrorism to be the worst possible evil yet at the same time sacralising any form of attention grabbing and then ban assault rifles. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, so here's a bit of context: 

1) The Fabian society is a think tank in Labour. It publishes all kinds of literature applying a certain tradition of British socialism to contemporary issues. The point is to flout ideas that nobody reads anyway, not to lobby for any serious change.

2) Britain is a massive proponent of EU expansion. Our own PM, David Cameron lobbied for Turkish to enter the EU. In 2012 (when this was published), Turkey was a candidate country - a somewhat successful model of a primarily Muslim country modelled on liberal reformism with a promising economic future. 

3) Guido Fawkes and the rest of the London Tories are working extremely hard to try and implicate Sadiq Khan with extremism. They haven't been too successful so far, but they're still playing with that idea that Muslims are untrustworthy, unbritish backstabbers.

So basically what we have here is an out of date and out of context headline that doesn't mean anything for the mayoral race. if you want to see the subtext, look at the comments on that page - quite disguising indeed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree--but would add that there's nothing inherently wrong with Sanders/Star Wars/Tinder/Dan Carlin, the problem is the way that reddit pesters on about these kinds of things in a way that's uncritical, unproductive and therefore boring. 

I love the *idea* of reddit - organic, indepth, wide-ranging discussions from internet users. If I'm looking for lifehacks or guitar tips or product reviews or something practical, I'll come here because I know that it's entirely organic. The problem is that after browsing for about five minutes, I'll see something stupid or hateful that gets me angry and sends me here. 

Heck, I'm only on CB right now because I was on a thread on /r/unitedkingdom thread about the new Top Gear line up

In short, there is something here and I think reddit could work as a decent website if major changes were made in terms of strictly moderating the site and enforcing basic standards including being vigilant towards hate speech. Unfortunately, Reddit is made up of internet idealists who don't really understand what things like free speech mean in practice and it is run by silicon valley types that are slightly less nave about this but have a vested interest in maintaining the lowest common denominator to maximise profits. </TEXT>

I'm also mature enough to understand that when cars are made obsolete (as guns are today) that ownership should be curtailed.

You want examples of non-violence being a force for political change? Look at *everything achieved in the confines of liberal democracy* from women rights to European unification to decolonisation to social legislation. Outside the confines of democracy we also have the Carnation revolution, the shouting revolution, the Tunisian revolution and pretty much every other peaceful revolution in history?

Also I'd like to see some other historical examples of mass-violence being a force for good, because everything from the French Revolution to the Haitian Revolution, to the Russian Revolution to the Syrian Revolution failed because of people tend to y'know stop thinking rationally and fairly when their families lives are at risk and lose themselves in a needless and unstoppable bloodbath. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Armed resistance groups like the marquis or the free French weren't nearly as effective as De Gaulle made them out to be in reconstructing the French state. Once the Vichy authorities or the Nazis captured one member, they could infiltrate the entire organisational structures of these groups. Much more effective in halting the Nazi regime was small acts of defiance - using the black market, hiding 'undesirable' jews etc that was difficult to stop at the source. 

Non-violence as a means for political change is pretty much always more effective eye for an eye approaches. Compare Mandela to Mugabe, Martin Luther to Malcolm X, Ghandi to Che Guevara. Even George Washington knew he was fighting a limited conflict and sought to normalise relations with Britain after the revolution. I wish more Americans would realise this   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a slightly phallic thing though, isn't it? An emotional attachment towards an object is called a fetish - the object compensates for something that someone is missing in either their personal lives or their relationships. A gun is unique in that its clearly designed to kill or wound. If someone told me they're obsessed with guns, I would think that they feel unreasonably insecure about other people and their environment in needing this object that they're more likely to kill themselves with than anything else. I'd probably avoid that person because they're irrational, insecure and have a dangerous weapon for my own safety. Then again, america is a military democracy so I guess the self worth of many of its citizens is vested in their capacity to be violent.

<TEXT> The difference is that Trump channels an inner despair of the American populace in a way that Boris doesn't. America's political system stops people's concerns from being heard and these concerns have created massive racial and economic inequality. If you're American, you're taught that your country and your systems of government is absolutely imperative to your freedom and there can literally be no other way. Meanwhile, most Americans realise that have no opportunity to find fulfilment because economic inequality is so acute. How do you deal with this sense of cognitive dissonance? While lots of Americans are supporting Sanders to change this very system, others are taking this pain out on those who they already feel superior to: black people, foreigners, immigrants.

The reason why people in Europe tend to view America unfavourably is that its wears its obvious and acute problems proudly and then with no sense of irony tells us we should follow their lead. What makes this all worse in the case of Trump is that he's emulating the very fascist politics that Europe resigned its world power to America over and there's nothing we can do about it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) Cogito ergo sum - the only thing we can authoritatively say that we know is what it is like to perceive the universe as ourselves. No amount of science will be able to tell us the exact nature of consciousness - it is impossible for us to distinguish a series of electrical currents from an actual being with its own subjective sense of awareness. It's impossible to explain certain existential things in scientific terms without saying "you're not actually alone in the universe; certain impulses or perhaps evolution makes you feel as if you are alone but you are really present right here", effectively dismissing the very things we live for. 

In other words, its impossible to reconcile subjectivity with one objective view of the world: if you were to say to someone who recently broke "love is just a bunch of chemicals that came from evolution - your relationship means absolutely nothing because its just a bunch of chemicals really" you would probably get punched because from their perspective, those chemicals are just a byproduct of something with meaning that only they can understand. 

2) It's impossible to know if one individual component part of a larger whole or not. We study humans on several different levels - society is studied through sociology, political science etc; thought patterns are studied through psychology, individual organisms are studied through biology and the forces that connect it all together are studied through physics. 

It would be stupid to attempt to explain, say cognitive dissonance on a chemical scale or biological processes on the scale of individual currents - cells are ultimately just a bunch of chemical elements arranged in a certain way, that doesn't mean we shouldn't study them on a biological level. Likewise, at some level humans are just cells and physical processes - that doesn't mean we should discount psychology, sociology, history etc when studying ourselves.

3) If indeed there are several different levels of existence that things can be studied at, how are we to know that we are the final, highest level of existence and we aren't just some component of some greater being?

I think it was Samuel L Jackson that used the word "chiraq" to charactirise south Chicago - firearm violence is just so commonplace that it's not even newsworthy. Thus people get the mistaken impression that mass shootings are the big problem with firearms.

The reason why this is still good even though it's ineffectual is that it's an example of the the federal government making a foothold in a previously untouchable part of America's racial inequality. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It has been said before that sport is the outdoor cousin of business. I don't think America's fetishism of enterprise would be possible without its obsession with sport. Major us sports leagues are a symbolic representation of the very concept of imperialism. Corporate sponsorship and racial aspects  aside, violence and competition at all costs in glorified, fans are meaninglessly turned on each other and the language of business is used to describe statistics and transfers. European fascist movements were at least honest about sport being a vessel for the construct of a 'new man', but this is only implied by capitalist society.

Fitness and exercise are natural phenomenon - a health body leads to a healthy intellect which is required if socialism is to ever be built. How can we we feed the pursuit of fitness into some kind of recreational exercise that does not reinforce patriarchal norms and is built on mututal cooperation, a desire to see everyone do better  rather than raw competition? Sport is one of the greatest joys of life and it would be fantastic if we could practice it without latently creating the conditions for capitalism, imperialism and patriarchy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was a big supporter of Yvette at the time, but I've not resigned to the position of so many non-corbynites that don't even want to give him a chance. I understand the 'lesser evil' argument for backing whatever gets us elected but the fact is that in supporting neoliberalism so many members have forgotten that its evil at all. Blairism has very little to say about the errosive effects of neoliberalism and indeed propagates it in many instances. 

Some might call Corbyn a utopian, but I think it's utopian to think that the current economic order built on finance debt and house prices can last. I think it's utopian to suggest that international institutions like the EU will last. I think it's utopian to believe that we can carry on consuming our way to growth when global warming and resource scarcity hit. I think its utopian to think we can indefininely wage a global war on terror, and beat terrorism with surveillance. 

These things didn't seem utopian around 97, but the past 20 years have shown that some problems aren't utopian and the future will not be bright at all. Blairites don't seem to have moved on since then (which is at least better than the many tories who haven't moved on economically since the late 1800s).  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [TOOL] Instead of setting a new year's resolution, you should reflect on how far you've come </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-30 04:51:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>  It's great to have goals, but you shouldn't be waiting for some arbitrary date or pressure from other people to set them. New Year resolutions reinforces the idea that you can only change yourself with some external cue. What this means is that when you say, eventually start smoking again you'll have no reason to get back on track. If you really *want* to get fit or learn a language or spend more time with your family, you shouldn't be waiting for the new year to do so. 

Instead, what I like to do is to look through everything I've done that year--all the places I've been to, all the things I've learned, what I'm grateful for, all the friends I've made, basically how I've become a better person than I was the year before. I also like to imagine where I want to be in 5 years, 10 years, 20 years and to try and track where my money went, all my journal entries, how much time I spend online, how anything I recorded or have data for changed in the year.  I try and be as realistic and as honest with myself as possible--and the truth is that 9 times out of 10 I will have made real improvements and become a better person that I was the year before. 

Once I've figured all this out, I'll type it up and put it on futureme.org and email it to myself for 1st January 2017. I'm excited for the new year because I'll get an email from myself that will remind me of where I was the year before, all the awesome stuff I did and get the chance to write the history of my own life. 

I find this is a more effective way of improving my life than setting arbitrary goals. I'm motivated to do it because everyone else is motivated by the new year, I get a sense of accomplishment and I get to stand back and think about where I'm *taking* my life rather than where its *going*. Had a shitty year and don't want to reflect on it? Not to worry, this system allows you to put all that stuff behind you and think about positive improvements you can make. Next year you'll look back at how bad it was and think about how far you've come!

It's such an easy thing to do that I think has lasting consequences and allows you to see the reason why you're doing certain things so that you don't have to wait for some random date to set your goals and really get whatever you want out of your life.

<TEXT> Woah woah woah, I thought reddit hated pseudo-science? Medical professionals aren't recommending mdma for people with mental health issues. All too often people with mental health issues can fall into the trap of thinking that there's a magic pill that they can take that will make them 'better'. It's so easy to think that the answer to your problems lies without and they won't have to undergo difficult therapy to change the way they think within. imo addiction is entirely caused by depression and nobody in a healthy state of mind gets into alcohol/heroin etc

Having said that, depression is an absence of feeling and sometimes being able to remember what feeling great  is like can help. I would not recommend self-prescribed drugs though. You would be far better advised to get that feeling of accomplishment from organizing your life/exercising, taking up a hobby or practicing mindfulness/self-love. 

I'm sure I'll be downvoted, but if you want a more objective opinion, ask people in /r/depression not people who are rolling and want everyone to feel the same way they feel.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have to understand though that technological 'advancement' doesn't always accompany human progress. In the interwar years, the Dutch pioneered in a national identification system to help redistribute goods and empower minorities. This was later used by the Nazis to identify and execute 'undesirable elements' of society. 

When we make these sorts of advances, we have to ask ourselves who controls them and who will benefit. The internet was a promised land back of self-expression and political engagement in the early 2000s and websites like Wikipedia were held up as examples for a future of participation and tolerance. Nowadays Tech is designed to discourage people from having to grapple with the grammar of its inner-workings, 90% of traffic is directed to about 10 different mega-corporations and regimes like china and isis use the internet to actively oppress peoples. Late modernity, has proven to be a period of political and social polarization where active learning and understanding is discouraged. If it weren't for the internet, we would have been able to correct reddity white males in public--nowadays they find e-silos where everyone shares their understanding of the world and their views are validated. Don't get me wrong, this has been great for groups like trans* people who have been able to find groups that accept them, but so long as the internet divides us it will entrench the dominant narrative--white male supremacy. 

Moral progress may be difficult to quantify, but this doesn't mean it should be ignored. Only when people have proven themselves responsible enough should they be given power and it would be inhuman to try and quantify this. Techno-capitalism cares only about short-term desire, it doesn't stop to ask whether things should be done only whether they can be done. 

You're right to say that this is pessimistic, but not unnecessarily so. It's a meta-narrative that helps us understand that social progress is not inevitable, that its never handed down from the top and it must be fought for.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a reddity meliorist liberal idea. America was built on enlightenment myths of continual progress, which were in turn derived from the Judeo-Christian belief in redemption (see "Al-Queda and what it means to be modern" by John Gray). The reality is that we're living in times of accelerated economic and technological growth. These changes aren't being accompanied by moral growth and so economics and technology is entrenching existing problems and magnifying them beyond their own size. This has been fine for the past 20 years because we have been able to make progress at the expense only of future generations by abusing natural resources. When these resources start to run out, we will start to see that further progress will be impossible, yet we will be rendered completely useless without it so will start to eat into ourselves as a planet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love this question, it's what I spent my time in America trying to figure out. I have several loosely connected ideas about America and why islamophobia is uniquely pervasive:

1) Americans no real understanding of 'social class', people are as self-conscious about being white in the US as they are about being middle-class in the UK.

2) The USA has an extremely simple history and would simply have not been possible without repression against Catholics, white genocide against Cherokees and other Indians, enslavement and then discrimination against blacks, internment of Asian Americans and Neo-Colonial wars. This is ironic, considering that the US's best cultural exports are jazz and hip hop which were musical responses to this kind of exploitation.

3) Americans are ridiculously patriotic - this doesn't mesh well when you're forced to confront the fact that none of your country's history would have been possible without racial oppression.

4) Being the 'great' is part of the American psyche. World police status and the desire to be number 1 in absolutely everything is absolutely essential to US self-image. This is reflected in everything from competitive US sports to the way kids are assessed in school to the uniquely oedipal foreign policy. 

5) The cold war is over, America has no simple enemy to prove itself against. 9/11 gave the US that enemy. The Islamist terrorist is almost too perfect to be true: its an ideological 'enemy within' that must always be beaten down like communism during the red scare whilst being physical targeted like certain states were during the cold war. 

6) America doesn't have a large Muslim population. Just as places in the UK that don't have many foreigners tend to vote UKIP, America is particularly Islamophobic because the 'Muslim threat' is entirely imaginary yet also impersonal. 

7) Facts don't matter in American politics. It's a criminal offense for a UK politician to knowingly lie, yet the practice is routine in America - especially in the GOP where people like Trump and Fiorina have built their candidacies on obvious lies.

8) America fetishises the individual. In the US, everyone is 'entitled to their opinion' while we tend to discern between 'good opinions and bad opinions' in the UK. We know implicitly that the BBC is a generally a truthful source of news in the UK, while all sources of the nearly 100% privately-owned media in the US are seen as being equally valid. This means that people on the right tend to get their news from idiot sources like theblaze, breitbart, talk radio or fox news and they're never forced to think critically about the news they consume or what they take away from it.

In some combination, these factors cultivate a non-culture of pig ignorant buffoons that ruin everything for everyone. I spent ages in the actual states thinking 'there must be something more to it than this' - but the reality of it was so unchallenging that it was almost challenging to come to terms with.  </TEXT>

There is no far left in America. Even by the standards of Britain, which is one of the most right-wing countries in the west, politics seems crazyly right-wing.

Warren is probably similar to conservative Angela Merkel in her political outlook.

<TEXT> I think the parallel has more to do with Paul/Sanders supporters being hysterically detached from the real world. 

I'd love this guy to be president, but lets be clear about this: he's unelectable and the best he can do is push Hillary to the left. The problem with fringe political activists is that they believe that everyone is *really* on their side and that the media/government/corporations are to blame for creating some sort of false consciousness. Paulites had the Nolan chart, I can see /r/politics banding around statistics about how everyone believes what they believe. People don't think in rational terms, they can't be won over with reason alone. We've got a grey haired old man running here that doesn't have a typical backstory, inexperienced, Jewish (sorry but its true) from a precocious New England state. That's enough to put off the majority of Americans, Democratic Americans even who have a family and real responsibilities that 20-odd year old reddits can't understand -- they value stability and they're not overly political. The Democrats have nominated left-wing candidates before, look at Addle Stevenson, Michael Dukakis and they lost spectacularly. At the same time and under similar pretenses, Britain's Labour party nominated an actual Marxist called Michael Foot and he lost spectacularly. There was one-thousand times more excitement and ten times the appeal of Bobby Kennedy and he didn't even get the ticket!

If you want to talk about the media, its not that there's some government/corporate conspiracy against libertarians and social democrats its that Sanders is just not media friendly. The media are biased but only towards ratings - they love visceral sensationalism (look the the unworthy coverage rick perry/ted cruz gets!) paul/sanders just can't convey themselves in an exciting, ratings-grabbing manner. But the fact is that even if you had 90% of all political coverage dedicated to paul/sanders he'd still lose because most people don't really consume politics news and get their information from ads that Sanders will never ever be able to buy. 


Sorry that this is uncomfortable reading. This isn't a 'not with that attitude' thing, but so many people here are going to be analyzing every component of the entire campaign trail thinking he actually has a chance and then realize that they wasted a year of their life on this. I'm not saying don't try and I think its great what you're doing but be aware that this guy just won't win no matter what and that's not why he's in the race. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You raise some good points and it is startling that someone who did go out of their way to cover their tracks can still be traced online. However, I don't think that personal security is the responsibility of children themselves. The pace of technology is so great that its impossible to be keep track of. There's no way you can blend into society without having social media in some capacity nowadays and all the pace at which detection technology is advancing just incredible. 

In 30 seconds I have know from your reddit account alone that you're a Scottish SNP supporter, you love football (arsenal), you play video games and especially the colin mcrae series. You probably work in the private sector, you're interested in world politics, scottish politics, european politics and british politics. I'm guess you're in your late 20s/early 30s. 

This is all on snoopsnoo.com and its all impossible to take off the internet. I know you're tech-savy and this is a site as innocuous and irrelevant as reddit - imagine what someone that knows what they're doing could find from across multiple websites... </TEXT>

Apart from Israel (which tends to vindicate stupid neocon ideas) we're the only major power that America listens to - we *could* for instance have actually hampered Iraq if Blair wasn't such a tool while the best France could do was to change the menu around at the white-house cafeteria. Other European countries even less so, Gerhard Schroder was vociferously against Iraq but America paid no attention. 

Sorry to go off topic and dig around a bit but this is what really confuses me about Scottish Nationalist Opinion. If we were to split the country in two and lose Trident then our place as the only sensible member of the UN P5 would be contested and America would probably just ignore everything the UN says and do whatever the fuck it wants *unilaterally*. Isn't this frightening, especially if you come from an internationalist/leftist persuasion?   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  He also used public funds for a series of repairs to the picturesque cottage including the removal of wisteria from a chimney. For most of the past five years, Mr Cameron has claimed only for mortgage interest and utility bills on his designated second home.
But he deviated from his straightforward claiming habits in November 2006 when he billed the public purse 680 for repairs to the cottage, including clearing wisteria and vines from a chimney, replacing outside lights and resealing his conservatory roof. He repaid the claim last month. Though his claims are among the simplest of any senior political figure, he has faced criticism from Labour politicians for the large amounts of public money claimed for the mortgage on his constituency home.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/shadow-cabinet-expenses/5633166/David-Camerons-expenses.html

Yep money to repair his cottage - that's so worth the sleepless nights on the campaign trail, the constant pressure to make life or death decisions every day, the slaughtering from the media, the jeering from MPs, the hatred of the country. As a Labour voter you've just sealed my deal - totally viable that a man as capable, knowing and talented as David Cameron (don't tell me he's a moron, he gets grilled *every single week* on national television about the most obscure issues in random parts of the country) totally went for the job so he could claim expenses (which he then called to abolish).  </TEXT>

Right but Farage has gotten lots of coverage, especially on question time. Jean Claude Junker isn't pulling the BBC's strings. 

 They aren't above skewing peoples statements either. The BBC reported HSBC saying it was the prospect of the UK leaving the EU that was prompting it to consider moving when they said nothing of the sort.

Yes, human error. Way better than The Telegraph who had their news bought out to favour HSBC. 

  Their reasons were due to regulation and ringfencing.

<TEXT>  We're talking about political issues here.

Yep, it's reporting is terrible. The way it frames anything about Ed Miliband is bloody ridiculous. It has also publish several articles about how global warming don't real. 

 So people who just read the Mail don't have jobs or run businesses or have children or watch the news. They're retarded because you disagree with the newspaper that they read. Right.

No I'm talking about someone who just reads the Daily Mail. I want them to get on with their lives with an accurate view of the world. If they use the Daily Mail as their source of news they will be wrong about what's happening in the world. 

 Who decides this? You, Winston, with your little jar of tip-ex? 

It's pretty well established. As it stands, the Guardian website has more stories about something that did not happen at a university in america (UVA rape) than it does about something real and important and disturbing in our country (rotherham). There are plenty of other ways I could show it's biased as I could with any other obviously biased newspaper.  </TEXT>

It's factually wrong, there is no relativism when it comes to truth. If that's your main source of information, then yes you will be voting for the wrong reason. 

 Are they somehow lesser beings because they don't have the same opinions as you, they don't buy the same newspaper as you, because they don't vote the same way as you? 

Yes, I have a better world view than people who just read the Daily Mail. Not saying they're bad people, but their opinions are unsubstantiated. 

 What if I went around talking about the guardian's lies about zero hours contracts and food banks and stoking up class tension, and demanded their abolition on the basis that it persuaded people to vote left-wing?

Yep The Guardian has an obvious left wing bias and we should make it neutral along with all the other papers. 

 There is- let people make their own mind up and mind your own fucking business. 

That's exactly what I'm saying - people should be able to form their own opinion without being filtered through the warped perspective of about 5 or 6 media barons.

<TEXT>  Why do you think that this opinion of yours is so right and proper that you want to physically force it upon every single person in this country?  


I'm not physically forcing anything, you can *choose* not to consume media if you want. My opinion is that everyone should be able to make their own minds up about things without being deceived. Barely Stalinistic. Under the current system people are beholden to the opinions of  5 or 6 millionaire media barons who don't think people should make up their own minds. 

 Do you not hold open the possibility that people who complain about BBC bias and who object to state control of the press may have a point, and that this conflict is best resolved by allowing people to make their own minds up, and allowed to produce or purchase such journalism that they see fit?

I've encountered a lot of those sorts and none have so far provided any evidence to substantiate their claims, so no I don't think they have a point. 

 Allow people to make their own minds up, and allowed to produce or purchase such journalism that they see fit

That's literally what I'm suggesting. Journalism is sacristan, I don't want it colonized, cheapened, americanized by market forces -- it's the fourth estate, the aim of all journalists should be to report *news*, not to sell papers. </TEXT>

The Liberal Party is probably more akin to New Labour--does whatever it can to get the vote, turning its back on climate change just because its electorally popular. The NDP seem to be close to the bleeding heart of Labour: big on public services, hates right-wing politics with a vengence, willing to make a principled stand.

<TEXT>  Far less money spent on the police, prison and legal system

Probably cancelled out by AandE admissions, therapy and addiction seminars. There could also be regulatory disputes depending on how its implemented: is someone carrying more coke than they would need to in public

 Greatly reduced levels of crime especially organised crime

Seems to be happening anyway. There 

http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21582041-rich-world-seeing-less-and-less-crime-even-face-high-unemployment-and-economic

 economic growth from a new industry and subsequent taxation 

The only way that this would be important enough to impact the debate would be if exise duties were placed on all drugs similar to alcohol. In that case you admit that we should discourage people from using drugs and they are bad.

 Reduction in accidental deaths due to improved drug quality and transparency of substances  

Mmh not necessarily. Colorado has seen a massive proliferation of weed because the government legitimised it and because all sorts of new users were trying it. There were then more vehicle accidents, children taking the drug and people just freaking out because they took too much. If we suddenly unleashed harder drugs on the public then we would certainly see more deaths because nobody would understand how to use them properly and they wouldn't know social conventions. 

 Drug addicts receive treatment instead of a sentence that makes finding work extremely hard making them a burden to society

Lots of needle exchange programmes, drug treatment programmes, amnesty programs. If you get caught for possession, you're not really going get a fine and a policie caution, not a jail sentence. 

 Reduction in prescription overdoses

Where did this come from? 

 The availability of drugs other than alcohol will lead to a reduction in alcohol related crime and accidents (IMO) 

And just subsitute it for another kind of crime? Acid is a different beast to weed, which is different to stims, which are different to alcohol. You use them for different purposes and the liklihood is that people will mix them with alcohol. 

 Decreases the availability of these drugs for children  

No way, edibles might even get banned in Colorado! I seriously doubt that an average 15 year old could get his hands on MDMA easily as it is right now. If it was legalised, he could just take some from daddy's cabinet. 


Some other problems: 

- Big drug companies akin to big tobacco 

Tobacco and alcohol companies make most of their money off frequent users. Drug companies would try and do the same, addiction would be in their every interest. 

- Drug tourism 

The Dutch hate us. Can you imagine people across Europe coming to your town for stag doos? You might say it brings in money but I don't think that measures with the shame that comes with being a drug haven. 

- People are stupid 

Out of the people I know, loads would get PTSD from bad trips. It's easy to die from plenty of other drugs too and it would be hard to caution them 

- Public nuisances 

I get freaked out by meth-heads and people on coke. Day time users would make things more dangerous as oppose to drunks that are mostly confined 

- Dependency 

It's absolutely awful to see people get hooked on drugs. As it is, drug use is falling so why take the risk?

- Drugs will affect the poorest the most 

You would only resort to drugs if your life was so stressful you needed to escape. Cigs are smoked by poor people and their health and income are taxed because of it. Drug legalisation would increase drug usage and thus entrench itself in certain communities. Working-class mothers would be more likely to, say smoke weed during pregnancy thus genetically altering the lives of kids. This would clearly exasperate inequality.

<TEXT>  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child defines a child as everyone under 18 unless, "under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier" (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 1989). The UK has ratified this convention.

Take a look at article 12. Nothing in there says human beings in this arbitrary and dependent category human maturity should not be able to vote.

If we're going to lower it to when you gain responsibilities, perhaps it should be lowered to the age of 10, that's the age of criminal responsibility (8 in Scotland though).

Just because something has an arbitrary, socially constructed approximate cut-off line doesn't mean it does not exist. There is a debate about maturity to be had in the UK and the fact that it's ambiguous does not make it less valid a debate. 

 Woah, when did the UK Government policy become affiliated with the American company LinkedIn.

It's a broader observation about childhood maturity 


I have no idea what criteria you think makes someone eligible to take part in the political process, but I suggest you look into the arguments made about how the vote was won and extended. All the arguments about why propertied men, women, disabled persons sounded extremely similar to the arguments you are raising.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get your first point, but even now Milliband seems to have a prospectus that is very similar to what Warren has been talking about for a long time. It should be exciting to see this I think.


 I also think you need to very careful not to fool yourself into thinking that /r/politics and /r/ukpolitics are in anyway representative of the real world. They represent a infinitesimally small sample of very young, tech savvy, left leaning idealists.

Maybe my point was broader: if you compare Cameron vs Obama's approval ratings you get very similar numbers. If you compare voter turnout, you get similar number. If you compare the number of people who think their country is in decline you get similar numbers. 

Yes reddit may be a small sample of the population, but I think its politics are representative of how people think in general. Everything is always shite wherever you are (in the west) and whoever comes first in the election, the government will always win. It disturbs me that such low esteem exists right now: what will we think if we ever get the US standards?

<TEXT> Fair enough. I have a leftish bent as well, not Scottish so I can't say what I'd think of the SNP. I wonder though why people on the liberal-left tend to be the most cynical about politics. If there isn't any trust in the government, there won't be enough public confidence in the government to do positive things like nationalise the north sea oil supply or expand the NHS and  the people mostly likely to change things in a progressive direction and won't vote or get involved in the political process at all. 

Labour have decisively moved to the left as well, I'm not sure why the Greens and Scottish Nationalists are taking off now Labour is talking about things like inequality. They're moving to the left but they don't seem to be winning back any voters. Why is it that the SNP are taking off now, not during the Blair Premiership (when the two parties were legitimately very similar and westminster-centric)? </TEXT>

How would anything even remotely close to that be achievable when Republicans scream about the constitution as soon as something as trivial as gun laws are change? 

The other thing is that the people themselves aren't going to get any smarter by changing the way capitol hill works. Australia have a similar system to what you're proposing and, well you can head over to /r/australia to see that they're suffering the equivalent of an unchecked GOP government going wild with climate legislation, patronage, spending cuts etc. North of the border, Stephen Harper is fucking over Canada in a parliamentary system too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seriously, we're talking about two Harvard former professors running on an anti-corruption populist-progressive platform. Their policies are almost exactly alike: act on inequality, lower student debt, break up the banks and seriously crack down on corruption. 

[Search through /r/politics](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/search?q=Warren restrict_sr=on sort=relevance t=all) and Warren is held up as the champion of ordinary people every single day. I've read dozens of times today that she should be running against Hillary for the presidency. 

Yet when I come to /r/ukpolitics, I see an equally ambitious politician that  is willing to talk about things most others don't (taking on Murdoch, Palestinian Statehood) with a very real chance of becoming our next Prime Minister. 

More broadly might point is that  that we have a political system American redditors dream of: Conservative party that accepts climate change and isn't ideologically obsessed, campaign spending limits and actual independent minded MPs that don't consult their donors before every single decision, multiple parties , no bullshit deadlock and legislation that actually passes, the chance to grill politicians in person etc yet nobody seems to be saying how great we have it. 


Maybe that was an incoherent ramble, but the point I'm trying to make is that we talk about politics in the most despairing terms possible when really we have it very very good.  </TEXT>

The beauty of congress is that 535-party system. A Georgia Democrat is going to be very different from a California Democrat, a Maine Republican is going to be very different from an Alabama Republican. We're living through pretty partisan times, but for the most part America has one of the least whipped, most accountable systems going. 

I don't know how having a third party would help anything anyway. It would just add confusion to the law making process and we'd see even less legislation. Similarly, if we saw Gary Johnson or Jill Stein win the presidency they wouldn't be able to set  a workable legislative agenda and they would have to act in the national interest abroad (basically carrying the same policies out as a republican/dem might). There would be nobody to defend them in congress any people wouldn't be able to rally around them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Libertarian solution to climate change is to stop socializing the environment (as all government environmental protection organizations do), and to allow individuals to properly punish polluters through a justice system.

Question is how do you stake a sufficient claim to part of the environment? Nobody can own a common asset that everyone depends on. How would we divy up the sea and how who could justifiably stake a claim that, say a natural resource company has made an infraction on their stake in the sea? How about space, are we to distribute specfic parts of the near-universe to specific people? How about air - are we to make oxygen a buy able asset?


 Pollution is a violation of the NAP; it is therefore legitimate to punish polluters. Alternatively, you can change the behavior of polluters by refusing to purchase their products. Many corporations have 'gone green' due to consumer demand. Intel, Apple, Google, Starbucks, etc.

Lots of these companies greenwash. They may make their internal opperations more environmentally friendly, but still buy from third party distributors that cause actually contribute the most to climate change. As a consumer, I have no stake in knowing how anything I own has changed hands and where it has originally come from. A company could install a solar panel on its roof and change their distribution contract to an extremely environmentally unfriendly firm and still claim that they are doing a good thing for the environment. 

There are so many contradictions with consumer power; Bill Gates might be known for being a superb guy with his charitable foundation, but most people don't know that he has lots of dodgy investments in fossil fuel companies that go some way to causing the problems he talks about. 

Ultimately, the burden should not be on the consumer to check up on the bad behavior of the firm. Boycotts rarely work and it would be impossible for me to spend all my time researching whether or not a firm is ethical before deciding to buy things as basic as sugar and flour. </TEXT>

I think a lib-lab coalition is the most likely scenario. Labour could threaten the Lib Dems with a left-wing SNP coalition and the lib dems would be forced to move the government to the center. If the Lib Dems stayed with the Tories, then they'd essentially be saying that they are Tory light and they don't care about the fact that the majority of people are more left wing than right wing but get screwed over by FPTP. Also, it's probably the best way to get a government that supports civil liberties--this is one of the selling points of the Lib Dems and Ed Miliband was an opponent of ID cards at the time.

<TEXT> "One man will not satisfy every person in the country--impossible." 

The problem is that outside of Reddit, Libertarianism is not a popular idea. Libertarianism does not transcend left-right politics, it does not combine the most popular parts of social liberalism and economic conservertism. I think this is the biggest falling point here and it's something Libertarians need to realize. Lets take the world's smallest quiz: 

"Government should not censor speech, press, media, or internet."  That sounds nice but the implication is "Government should not restrict the distribution of indecent pornography nor remove radicalizing and terror influences from circulation"

"Military service should be voluntary. There should be no draft."  Means that there should be no draft in total war 

"There should be no laws regarding sex for consenting adults." Legalize Prostitution without any regulation

"Repeal laws prohibiting adult possession and use of drugs." Legalize Meth and remove all regulations

"There should be no National ID card." Do not enforce everify, no background checks for migrant workers, no real check for terrorists entering the country

See it's nice to phrase things a certain way - thats how politics works but those things in combination only appeal to a few lets face it younger, wealthy white men without any obligations. 

On the point about the media blackout, I'm not sure what role the *state* has in stopping private companies doing what they want (which by the way is favoring sensationalist telegenic candidates). 

Ted Cruz upsets the status-quo, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren upsets the status quo and they get lots and lots of attention. Still, being generous to the blackout argument, if Paul got 1% of the coverage of the entire primary season he got hundreds of hours of coverage on our 24/7 news-media. I didn't see Romney become more libertarian because of Paul and I don't see our country getting more libertarian as a result of this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly man you've got to take a step back and look at this from the perspective of the average voter and the GOP. Here we have a crusty old man that has a tendency to speak incoherent in a whiny sort of voice. His ideas are extreme, he looks to his ideology before he looks at the actual situation. The answer in absolutely to absolutely every single conceivable scenario is 'this is an issue for the private sector to think about'. If you're a pensioner relying on social security you're not going to take well to a man that wants to get rid of medicare and senior benefits. If you're a bleeding heart evangelical conservative you're not going to be happy when the guy says Israel is a war criminal. If you're a GOP donor you're not going to be happy with a man that wants to reduce capital investment. Most people look at the guy as if he's a crank who would go to the whitehouse, find out that the world is a complicated chessboard that could explode with any single move and have no idea what to do because he's blocked out every idea that uses the government instrument his entire life.

<TITLE> Am I physiologically 'feeling' depression in my body not just my mind? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-27 03:00:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have had depression for 3 years now - my peak in the first two years was when I was diagnosed as 'moderately' depressed and prescribed a high dosage of sertraline. I eventually self-medicated and stopped taking them because I was secure, fulfilled and enjoying life for a long while. Since studying abroad, the depression came back and I'm now 'severely' depressed. I am on 300mg of Wellbutrine but it's gotten to the point where I have to garner the energy to even schedule another checkup with my doctor. I can't go through with therapy - last time (around December) I missed so many appointments and felt bad about it, I didn't do the exercises the therapist set and I didn't feel like it was very beneficial. 

My typical day looks like this: sleep in until the afternoon, go to class, come back a sleep a bit more, go to the library at around 6-7, procrastinate until around 11 then rush off whatever school work I have to do for tomorrow. I care deeply about my studies - I really want to do well, I love the stuff I'm learning but I pathologically procrastinate to the point where it's not even procrastination but self-sabotage. I then might go back and stay up until 2-4am, maybe smoke a joint and just waste more time on my computer. 

I think I understand depression - it's brought on by a dislocation of the self, it's bad because you have no agency or control over your life. The solution is simple: force yourself to do things you don't want to, be productive, fight back again your short-term impulses. It's no permanent solution, but it alleviates depression in the short-term. Your body tells you to take the path of least resistance - some days you can fight back but the black dog will always eventually be able to take you down after a while. I'm considering not even trying anymore and just doing everything I need to do while on vyvanse every other week. 

Anyway what I'm trying to ask is does the tiredness, the inertia, the lack of drive feel, the general fatigue feel like it's coming from the body rather than the mind for anyone else? It feels as I'm physically ill just as much as I am mentally ill. 

I don't know this post was too non-sequitur sorry I might go back and make it more logical in a bit. I normally make a shadow account for these posts but I can't be bothered.  I'm looking for any kind of insight, feel free to give advice, call me out, relate, whatever I won't be offended and honest opinions . cheers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi it's currently 2.22 and I have to get a bus to DC for spring break at 6.30 tomorrow. I stupidly left my 300mg wellbutrine prescription at college and now I'm feeling everything from zero motivation to back pain to insomnia. 

This might be a more practical question than this sub normally gets but has anyone been through this? I'll be unable to get this for a week and last time I forgot to take pills for more than one day I fell asleep in public randomly and got shocks. It wasn't at all pleasant - I have a tonne of homework that I know needs to be done and I have motivation issues as it is! I'm 6000miles away from home, I'll be in a foreign city without any of my freinds for the next week and I'm freaking out as to how I'll be able to survive this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry Farage was a commodities trader. Same difference - his job was to nefariously trade other people's stuff about, without actually creating anything real. Like his father, he didn't dedicate his life to public service, he dedicated his career purely to his own self-interest. It clearly says that his dad was an alcoholic that abandoned his children. Maybe corrupt wasn't the best way of phrasing it and maybe I was being insensitive to the struggles of growing up with a single parent - I will retract that tiny detail from my argument if you want me to. Still though, OP was pretty insensitive  in mentioning how Miliband's dad was a Marxist and in neglecting the more pertinent fact that has actually impacted Ed's perspective more that both his parents were holocaust survivors. James O'Brein dug into the dodgy deals Farage did on that car-crash interview on LBC. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Who would you prefer? Nigel Farage - public school educated, followed his daddies footsteps as a corrupt stockbroker? David Cameron - I don't even think I have to go there, he's descended from royalty. Natalie Bennett - Australian journalist, never had a real job outside of journalism and politics?

Maybe you'd like some perfect rags to riches type to be contending, whose perspective is so distorted because he just presumes that everyone has the capability of him. He'd big up his background so much that he'd refuse to see any of his own flaws. He'd have no guilt-induced moral duty to be in politics - having not benefited from a system that privileges the already privileged. He would have no impulse to keep up with the changing dynamic of British society. He would be way more out of touch than the people we have already got. Moreso to be as exceptional as he is and to be able to enter a very closed, nepotistic political circle he would literally have to be a psychopath - completely unrepresentative of the British public at large. 

Maybe you'd like to survey all 60million of us and find the most average person out there - lets say he earns 27,000 as an IT consultant, he went to a polytechnic and comes from Birmingham. Would he be able to speak on behalf of a Pakistani cleaner from Leeds or a nurse in London or a business owner in Glasgow? One of the beauties of British society is that there is no 'average', we will never have a Hugo Chavez type that unites absolutely all of us. More so, would he have any idea about how to understand all the people around him that came from or climbed up a closed net of politicos? Would he have to capacity deal with any of the stresses or tasks of being in charge of one of the most powerful countries in the world?  I live in the states at the moment and I can see these types in congress, they have no idea how anything works so they delegate most of their decisions to advisers that aren't accountable to the public and are trying to climb the greasy pole without a sense of public duty.

I think being snarky about where our leaders came from is pointless. I'm a Labourite but I think my fellow party members are making a cheap jibe by criticizing Cameron for being born into wealth - he didn't choose his circumstances of his birth. Yes, there's a structural problem in parliament - it's too white, too male, too middle-class, too many people that have only worked in politics before and too many people that only got there through connections. We need to make some structural changes that might be painful in the short term - including all women/bme/working class shortlists. You're not going to change the essential reality of our system by electing a leader that defies the norm. If anything, you're going to obscure the fact that Cameron, Miliband, Clegg, Farage, Bennett ARE representative of the majority of our elites and we have a problem that needs to be changed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on the issue - if there were problems with a local school I may visit the school governers - if they couldn't help because there was some kind of external problem I'd go to my council. Where I'm from, we have a unitary authority meaning that all local power is vested in a single body; when I lived down south there was a city council and a county council and nobody could tell you which had which powers. In some places there are parish councils that deal with micro issues. 

If the issue was larger, I'd go to my MP at his surgery - he's a feckless idiot though - which means a petition is probably the best thing. Some schools exist outside of the control of the local authority, in which case I'd have to contact the national government minister for education directly. Some issues pertaining, for example to regulations can only be sorted out at a supranational level so I spose Id have to go to my MEP (whose name I don't even know).

<TEXT> The FT, the Times of London, Reuters and the Economist are just as top notch in terms of news sources. Edit: I think The Private Eye is fantastic for investigative journalism too and The Spectator is a magazine favorite on the centre-right



 It's worth noting as well how people actually consume news.  

[This](http://www.gallup.com/poll/163412/americans-main-source-news.aspx) gallup poll gives a pretty good picture of national news consumption in the US. Television accounts for 55% of news consumptions over there; they don't have the same broadcasting regulations that we do so national news comes through sensationalists like CNN or unashamedly partisan channels like MSNBC and Fox. Internet sites comes next - which is obviously far more advertising driven and entirely unregulated; judging from the stuff my freinds post on facebook these are sites like the drugde report and breitbart that make Guido Fawkes look liberal. A bulk of this will be tweets sumarising stories or comments on the page rather than the stories themselves too. Print comes next - and, aside from the new york times, the publications you mentioned aren't even there - the bulk of consumption will come from gossip magazines and tabloids. Finally - talk radio makes up 5% of consumption and in the states this is basically right-wing crap that truckers listen to like  - Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh and even Alex Jones.

In the UK things are on the decline and we have some big popular outlets like the Daily Mail and the Sun and some people even get their news from things like the Lad Bible on Facebook. Still though, the BBC makes up for the vast majority on news consumption over here - and although it has its flaws, you only need look at the way american redditors talk about it to see how much better it is than 99% of what you get in the states.

This is the general public that wants lower taxes and higher spending - drug legalization and the death penalty - Britain to be a 'great power' on the international stage without getting involved with foreign aid, humanitarian intervention or European alliances. If there was a major demand for an economic revolution, there would be a mass exodus right now - but political involvement has barely changed in England at least. If anything, the political spectrum has shifted way to the right - Enoch Powell is no longer toxic, the issue of the day isn't whether we should enter the Euro but whether we should leave the EU and the public are set to vote for a kind of austerity we've never seen before. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was expecting an argument, but that was one of the best responses I've ever had on reddit. 

If this particular group is neglected - why is it that every speech on the economy or benefits has men at work in a construction factory in the background? Why is it that the Cameron's entire programme is about drastic action on complicated social and diplomatic issues - EU referendum, benefit cap, tougher on criminals, action to stop terrorism etc? Why is it that Miliband is forced to match Cameron on all of this, posing with The Sun and emphasising   perfunctory bullshit about soldiers or football clubs? Why is it that so much column space has been dedicated to 'white van conservatism', 'blue collar labour', 'working-class UKIP' etc?


The same thing happens in the states - stars and stripes covered truckers and farmers are given top spot in political adverts and every politician has a backstory about castrating hogs or working as a mechanic. 

It's stupid - these people don't claim a monopoly on the salt of the earth; IT consultants, window cleaners and quantitative surveyors play a big role but scarcely get mentioned. Nor do immigrants that actually do crappy graft work get much of a say in the political process. 

I think the concerns that you mentioned tend to be based on emotive reflects - daily mail headlines rather than actual knowhow. There's no way to argue with these positions - they have everything to do with individual identity and nothing to do with that's best for society. I'm sick of all this pandering; the world has changed are there's nothing you can do about it apart from suck it up.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The difference in planned spending between Labour and the Tories is the biggest it has been since 1992. The Conservatives want to cut capital spending and Labour don't. The Conservatives want to cut the schools budget and Labour don't. The Conservatives are hand tied in that they can't raise taxes, while Labour are proposing a whole bunch of populist measures to make up for the deficit. 

The only conceivable way you could say that the two main parties are the same is by pulling out some situtationist arguments about how everything in society is merely a representation about what has been or something. This is literally the biggest election since the Thatcher years - and it's likely that we will see more than one party in power this may anyway... </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi there, I've been studying in New England since August last year and it seems like every single conversation I have is about being British. We all know how obsessed yanks get "oh my gaawd your accent is so sophisticated [even though I'm a manc with a mr beanish twang]" "have you seen Dr Who before - I have a scalf!" and it's easy to take well to the attention. Our frames of reference are completely different - I have absolutely no interest in any american sport and congressional politics seems to bore. So there's little you can actually talk about apart from how different America is to the UK. Without being a lapdog, it's easy to take to the very positive archetypes they have for us. They're absolutely obsessed with us and its pretty hard to avoid the conversation. Literally every conversation starts with "where are you from" and a brief explanation of how Britain is different to America. 

All this forced introspection - and the fact that it's so easy to fall back talking about what it's like to be British makes me feel as if I'm become more myopic, self-obsessed, narcissistic. I'm hoping I won't be an absolute backwards baseball cap-wearing prick when I come back that has literally nothing to talk about. Do any expats feel like this is the case? </TEXT>

Maybe for micro economics, but at the end of the day you can can make statistics about anything - but the number of extraneous variables in the entire global economy (varying from the voting behaviour of cypriots to the weather in new hampshire) just make things too complicate to calculate. 

 mathematical models that are empirically testable

No they aren't. Academics can't just, say stimulate the construction industry on demand, you need politicians to do that. Sure, you can make models that looks very similar to economies, but ultimately thats like creating a 3D simulation of a rat to conduct lab tests - completely pointless and unnatural. As much as you want to dress up economics with statistics, it's catagorically a  *social science* and that means it's about human motivation and behaviour, which is impossible to fully understand no matter how advanced human technology becomes. 

 Non-state-socialist academics actually know that they cannot predict the market (otherwise there'd be no need for a market). I don't expect them to predict how the markets go. I expect them to make predictions from models that simplify markets. The map is not the territory, and their models of markets are not the market.

Right - so you're saying we actually can predict markets. Why then has nobody found a model to completely rig the stock market with 99.99999% certainty? Why are economies so sensistive to external shocks if governments could hire people to tell them exactly the way things are going? Why is it that several completely opposing schools exist and nobody can say with certainty which is the 'correct' school. 

Honestly, it seems like you're pretending to be 'above' non-mainstream ideas by dismissing any kind of unauthodoxy and asks us to listen to 'the experts' instead. Well listen - they're just as flawed, just as corrupt and need just as much scrutiny as the rest of us. Dressing someone up in a labcoat and telling everyone that they know more about the public than the public themselves and that they have somehow found a monopoly on meaning is a totalitarian idea.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They said that Steve Keen has written extensively about it - and he has. Economics is known as the 'dysmal science'; to expect academics to predict how the markets go would be like asking historians to predict the future. I recommend you watch the Matt Damon documentary 'Inside Job', it shows how senior figures in the monetarist world were paid off in the pre-crises years to support failing policies and institutions. The facade that economics is a science leads us to trust charlatans that, against the grandiosity of the world finanical system know as little as we do about how everything works. 

Besides all this, it's a CIF video - its not meant to be dry, it's meant to inform and provoke. Expecting the guy to cite everything would be like expecting a regular CIF article to come with MLA-style references at the bottom.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The literal translation of democracy is people-power. The queen has no real power to do anything constructive - instead she ties us as a nation and as people. Her office acts an anchor - without a popular and traditional head of state, we would lose a sense of who we are and why we  should sacrafice for greater good of the British state. 


I'd also like to contribute a thought I've had: the queen gifts us with knowing that no, not everyone has a fair chance of making it to the top of society. While Americans pride themselves and define themselves by their republicanism, they're blind to the lack of opportunity that exists in their country. Having a monarchy led to class-conciousness in britian, which is turn led to an innate distrust of power (look at prime ministers questions or the way business leaders are grilled in select committees) and a polity willing fight for its own interests. By contrast, Americans became so welded to the idea of the 'american dream', leaders were able to manipulate this naivety to crush socialist movements and push for the interests of a wealthy elite. </TEXT>

I live in America and people regularly tell me how the BBC is the most accurate source of information - more so than the NYT with its political neutrality and more than NPR with its international perspective. I have had communications directors on Capitol Hill tell me the BBC is the first place they go to. Fox News is infotainment, CNN is so heavily slanted to conflict and sensationalism it's just hard to discern anything while the Pravda was literally state propaganda in a backwards, totalitarian regime.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not necessarily - some taxes, like the VAT are downright regressive and likely to hit the poorest members of society the most. Taxes on the minimum wage can actually incentivise people to stay on benefits. Extremely high income taxes bring in less revenue - compare tax returns under Callaghan vs the later years if Thatcher - and this means less money for hospitals, schools etc. Right now taxes are chronically low and reductions aren't going to help the poor/middle class as much as other interventions, but theoretically there can be moral arguments for lower taxes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a good idea - revolutionary even, just imagine how capitalism would change if people didn't have to go to shitty jobs at poverty pay to live. 

I think the biggest thing that people neglect is that welfare only works if there's a good amount of public support for it. The changes to the tax code and the benefits system this government have made are among their most popular policies. Brits see social security in a very negative way 'how's it fair that some layabout can take MY hard-earned money'. Nobody political party can change that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, the defend budget is miniscule and the reality of the situation is that governments always cock projects up (see universal credit under IDS). The money that's being added to the deficit now is coming from a shortfall in taxes and destructive, yet electorally salient projects like help to buy.

Also Britain actually grew through brown's last budget, when the spending cuts kicked in, the economy shrank and around the time Osborne started spending again we started to see growth. What brown did in his last years in office - sway fiscally conservative bush to adopt an expansive TARP recovery programme, lead the G20 through one of the greatest disasters of all time and save an economy largely dependent on financial services from collapse was a masterclass class in leadership.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember seeing Ed Milliband making a "speech" in the centre of town on a scruffy wooden pallet. Of course he was surrounded by advisers and guards and personal army I reporters and cameras to show everybody how working class Ed is!

Ever seen David Cameron do that? Nah probably not, doubt you'd feel the need to brand him out of touch though. Even if security guards weren't guarding one of the most powerful men in britain like that, you'd probably laugh at him for being egged or beaten up.

Do you remember that Emily Thornburry twitter incident? I think that brings home my point more than anything. An experienced MP representing the working class baffled as to why anybody would fly the Saint George's flag. Just completely disconnected from real people. Like I said, so are the Conservatives but they don't pretend to be like that.

It was literally a picture of a house with the caption 'image from #rochester' from a politician that is known to tweet inane pictures from doorknocking - quite an abstraction you've made there. Oh and how does that somehow represent the entirety of the 100,000+ member labour movement, especially when party officially quickly denounced and fired her? 

On a more trivial note I can take barely any of the labour leadership seriously. Every time they speak I cringe. The only one I can take seriously is Chuka Umunna, at least he seems to believe what he is saying and backs himself a bit

Yeah that's a substantiated point. Thanks for contributing to the discussion with your enlightened observations! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The outgoing Chancellor leaving a note on the desk for Osborne saying "Sorry, the money's all gone - best of luck" would be funny if it weren't true.

Actually it was Liam Byrne who was a treasury minister. In spite of that, this government has still managed to borrow more in 5 years than labour did in 13 http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2014/12/in-graphs-george-osborne-fought-the-debt-and-the-debt-won/ funny eh?

I know small business owners who were forced out of business as a direct result of Labour policies, and lets not forget the heavy erosion in civil liberties that was ushered in under the "something must be done" mantra of Anti-Terror Laws, etc.

Which policies? New Labour was desperate to do everything possible for business, it facilitated employment, lowered the corporate tax bill and prevented the entire economy from diving in 2008. Anyway, you're probably talking about the global recession that hit literally every country in the west - would we have avoided it if we had George Osborne "I'll match Gordon Brown's budget pound-for-pound" or "we need to encourage risk taking" michael howard or the plethora of Tory MPs that were lobbying for less financial oversight from the FSA? Doubt it. 

As for Civil Liberties - the tories voted those anti-terror laws in opposition (Ed Miliband didn't) and this government has only gone on to nstitute secret courts, internet surveillance, gag charities and threaten to scrap the human rights act.

Can't comment on your Local MP because you didn't mention him by name. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the point is the world we see on Facebook is an entirely fabricated reality where only a certain version of ourselves is presented. Yes, you can choose what you put on there (providing it can be expressed in the form of a status, a picture or a video that meets certain social expectations) but facebook chooses the way that data is presented back to us. The aim of this is to fit us into a catagory that allows marketers to target us as neatly as possible. The 'year in review' app is a way of reaffirming that catagory and saying 'these are  the important things that happened to you this year', 'this is who you are'. The more we technology advances and the more we put on social media, the more companies like Facebook will convincingly be able to own us and prod us like voodoo dolls. When the algorithm that determines all of this goes wrong and presents sensitive memories as 'highlights', the spectacle is ruined and the morbid reality - that we are slowly sacraficing our very essence to companies like Facebook and there's nothing that we can do about it is revealed. That's what makes this morbid, and I think seeing this as a 'free app' just like Facebook want us to is extremely dangerous and we owe it to ourselves to keep them to account. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think he framed his point badly, but it still stands. People always wants to have their cake and eat it too. In this case, they begged for the movie to get released and when Sony had the guts to heed to those demands, reddit still managed to distribute it illegally and thus deny even basic respect to Sony for its decision to put their asses on the line. People begged for marijuana to get legalized and when it finally was, they still bought illegally at street prices. People complained about newspapers putting up paywalls but didn't make adblock exceptions for newspapers that made ran on losses to get keep their content free.

Reddit complains about the public being solipsistic and self-sabataging, when the public decide to sacrafice basic liberties for counter-terrorism controls or 'boomers' voting for pension rises  without proportionally contributing back to society or middle-aged people who benefited from government grants not willing to pay taxes to keep college affordable. What redditors doesn't realize is that they exhibit a turbo-charged form of this kind of egoism when it it comes to the basic indecencies I mentioned above. 

The idea that companies will just let consumers buy whatever the hell they want AND set the price (a model being vigorously advocated on this reddit) looks ridiculous when you see the kind of mass-indulgence you get here. Sure, a few media outlets have been successful using this model while it's still a novelty but if this became an industry standard, you can be sure as hell it wouldn't work.

Obviously businesses have to stay financially viable, so when they manipulate reddit's voting system or covertly hide advertisements inside articles or abuse product placement reddit sure as hell can't complain over at places like /r/hailcorporate </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nowhere does it say activists should 'ignore' immigration, just acknowledge their concerns, maybe mention that [Labour will go further than the coalition on immigration](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/23/labour-immigration-reform-bill-voter-concerns) and then talk about other issues UKIP rather wouldn't. Worries over 'social cohesion' ARE irrational - remember that fact that white voters in diverse communities tend to agree with UKIP less than white voters in non-immigrant communities? remember how immigrants [objectively contribute way more than non-immigrants to society](http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21631076-rather-lot-according-new-piece-research-what-have-immigrants-ever-done-us) (before you dispute this, remember that [farage himself agrees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWeL5hLKO0k)). These are objective, logical facts, but voters don't care if you mention them because they can't be persuaded on the basis of facts. If you can get a copy of it, Satre's 'Anti-Semite and Jew' explains this and I believe that the sentiments propelling UKIP are the exact same sentiments that propelled populist/fascist parties across Europe. That's not to say that the concern about immigration isn't valid, but its not something you can argue with or change people's mind on. Stop being so paranoid and susceptible to slippery slopes - levelling this minor document that against the very concept of democracy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think it says candidates should ignore people's concerns about immigration. It just seems to be politely saying that fears about immigration can't be argued with rationally. If your job is to win votes over, mention that Labour have acknowledges these fears but emphasise Labour's policies on the NHS and Housing - two areas, by the way that UKIP don't have a coherent stance on.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's exactly what the document says - you can't out-ukip UKIP on immigration so listen to voters concerns and make sure they know about Labour's policies on housing and the NHS. Blindly pushing out party dogma without actually listening to people's concerns is anti-democratic. This is the party that expects to govern the entire country; its policies have to broadly represent the national mood - that isn't complete nationalisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange without compensation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah thats another thing, Brits don't want coalition government. When the houses of parliament were rebuilt after being bombed in WW2, planners were instructed to rebuilt it in a government/opposition bench confrontational way - even though Labour, Independents etc made the UK a multiparty democracy. We want strength, not compromise - so the coalition could never work in a conventional way. The Conservatives haven't given an inch on any points of principle to the Liberal party - I do not see why it should have been the reverse. 

I don't even know why people seem to think that the Liberals were forced into accepting tuition fees - senior figures have repeatedly made clear that they regret promising to lower tuition fees but they do not regret voting for higher tuition fees. This just shows them as a bunch of middle-class tory-lite compromise merchants that would do anything to get elected. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nobody voted for the lib dems because of their policies on working hours or child tax credits - they were seen as an alternative to the hollow spin machines Labour and Tory. Instead of using all their political capital to challenge the two-party consensus on things like civil liberties, drug laws and tuition fees they claimed credit for a few nice things that Tory sadomonetarists don't care about like cracking down on homophobia or lowering taxes for the low paid. The reason everyone hates them now is that they are literally a caricature of everything wrong with politics: corrupt, spineless, deceptive, spinsters  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bankers, Oligarchs, Shareholders, Tax dodgers, Globalised Capitalism, The European Commission etc are all potential scapegoats for left-of-centre parties. 

Podemos in Spain and Syriza and Greece are running populist platforms that basically blames all of the above. </TEXT>

<TEXT> UKIP are edging that way - they're now against the TIIP and they want to re-nationalize parts of the NHS, Farage said he sees neither left nor right but right and wrong. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not like they have a rational or coherent programme of policies. The only reason to vote to vote for them is because of who they are -- and because UKIP have set the bar so low, this is the only way to talk about them. Who they are is constituted by the people that vote for them. If the most successful leader of British fascism in the past 50 years is voting for them, it certainly is grounds to dismiss them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 20 years ago we didn't have rolling news and social media. With the demand for so much news so much of the time obviously the quality had to drop.

<TEXT> I've seen very clever people on the left and on the right post it on facebook. People on this subreddit naturally have an anti-politician bias too and I can see it getting upvoted here just as easily. Don't pretend it's "those people" that are susceptible to this kind of behavior.

<TITLE> [Political Economy] How has Sweden managed to create a sustainable social democracy, while France's social model seemingly teeters from crises to crises? </TITLE>

<TEXT> With the concessions Manuel Vall is being forced to make to big business, it's pretty clear that France will *have* to make reforms to its corporatism social model if it is to remain competitive. Pretty much everything I read about France's economic woes recommends either this or unrealistic structural changes to the EU or international capitalism. 

Meanwhile, Sweden seems to have fared better than others from the great recession and meager neo-liberal reforms of the Moderate party have been rejected during the recent elections. Sweden's social model seems structurally sustainable and its position on the ease of doing business index, its credit rating reflect this. 

What's going on here - it seems to me that people in these two countries have pretty similar attitudes to society and the state. The Government has a large stake in industries in both countries and the left can claim a pretty large stake in elections? </TEXT>
