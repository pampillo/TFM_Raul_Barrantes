<TEXT> I'm 25 and me and my boyfriend just switched to a  diet together 6 months ago. I've never been a huge meat eater, my mum is veggie so I grew up around a lot of vegetarian cooking and while I was studying and on a limited income I hardly ate any meat either. I think I just finally came to the realisation that I can have a perfectly healthy and balanced diet without meat - and eating it started to seem more and more immoral. Doing it with my bf on board too had been really helpful - especially when eating out and stuff. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The issue with the analogy, and your interpretation of it is that women as 'locks' are the keepers of sexual activity and have to be 'opened' by being persuaded into having sex by men or 'keys'. You state that your understanding of the analogy is based on the relative 'difficulty' for men and women to engage in sexual acts. I think that this 'difficultly' you purport to be interested in is really a reflection of what you imagine male and female sexual roles should be. The key/lock only works if the average man is always looking for sex with as many partners as possible and the average woman is not so driven by sex and is instead always defending their virginity or monogamous relationship. If you take those gendered sexual roles as a given, the sure a cock is to a key as a pussy is to a lock. 
However, I'd argue that women's sexual desires have historically been routinely misrepresented, controlled and denied acknowledgment which have shaped cultural attitudes towards gendered sexual roles (and produced analogies such as this one). It's only relatively recently that science accepted that women could experience sexual pleasure! 

However, there is now more than ample evidence to show that women are just as much sexual beings as men, who enjoy, want and look for sex, and if you can accept that then this analogy makes no sense. Because as equally sexually interested partners suddenly the keys aren't trying to unlock those usually tricky locks who are so uptight and not driven by sex unless 'unlocked' by the right key which makes him so impressive if he manages to unlock a lot of them (maybe having a lot of sexual partners just isn't impressive for any gender!) And equally it's no longer slutty for a woman to have multiple partners because the gendered norm isn't that women don't really enjoy sex and therefore shouldn't seek it out.

<TEXT> I take your point but don't think it couldn't have been resolved any other way. It's clear when the dying woman tries to get into the bunker that something is going on - alien or otherwise, so he's partially vindicated at that point. 
And as for the Michelle's story arc, I wasn't necessarily saying that the film should have just ended when she escaped, just that it didn't need the cg. I like that the ending is clearly an alien invasion, but it's too long and for me didn't work. </TEXT>

They were a bit of an experiment, pastry is standard shortcrust 2:1 flour to butter and filling was a mish mash of veg I had around, squash, butter beans, carrots, mushrooms, peas, celery, and red lentils to thicken, added to a creamy curry sauce of onion, garlic, coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala, stock, passata and creme fraiche. The key I think was letting the filling cool totally and then leaving the filled pies in muffin tins to rest in the fridge for 30 mins before cooking   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey I just started making cp soap recently too. My most christmassy one so far is chocolate orange with cinnamon which was 10 fold orange essential oil, cocoa powder and cinnamon powder(although maybe cinnamon leaf essential oil would be better) in base oils of
40% coconut oil 
30% shea butter
30% olive oil
And super fat at 5%
It's a great chocolatey colour and the cinnamon and orange has a real festive smell, So everyone's getting a bar of that for Christmas!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of the items you listed the ones I use most frequently (apart from the French press which I only use for coffee so not sure I could add anything) are the food processor and ice cream maker. So here are my tips:
Food processor - I love to use mine for curry bases/pastes, pesto, bean or chickpea hummus, mayonnaise, falafel, quickly shredding carrots for all kinds of things, with a blender too you can have fun with different soups - I made a lovely spicy pumpkin and coriander over Halloween 
Ice cream maker - you can experiment with all kinds of flavours and types, Italian gelato, sorbets, there are tonnes of recipes online I find ice cream really satisfying to make!

<TEXT> It's context specific, and a tame example of the things that will get said to make a point. The OP had mentioned travelling Morocco which was where I was thinking of from personal experience, although it happens in most countries in differing degrees of regularity. Especially in the cities, men will sit on the side of the street and yell things at women, often lewd things, and make disconcerting eye contact with you. In that situation it doesn't really matter what is being said, it's harassing because it's humiliating to be shouted at walking down the street. As I said, the man making the comments doesn't seem to expect or want a verbal response in my experience, so what is the purpose of the comment in the first place if not to harass?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As annoying or unpleasant an experience it might be to have a confrontation over what is essentially your right to travel without harassment as a female alone it's the method I've found that works. Just tell them straight to leave you alone, if that doesn't work just repeat no - learn a couple of choice phrases in the language of the country you are travelling to as well. 

In my experience there are two types of harassment that you will experience as a female traveller. Street harassment where as much as he might tell you how good you look he doesn't really want or expect a response from you . And secondly, opportunistic men who think that a female travelling alone might be a good sexual target (these men exist everywhere but often target drunk women). In either situation showing that you are in control and assertive is the best approach. And being verbally aggressive if necessary.

As other commenters have pointed out, if you want to go out drinking then it doesn't hurt to find a couple of friendly fellow travellers from your hostel to go with.

Best of luck, it's an annoying part of travelling alone as a female, but I don't think it should put people off the many benefits and wonderful things you can learn and experience travelling alone. I think sharing experiences and strategies are a great step towards making solo travel as safe and a accessible for women as it is for men. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I applied a tool I learnt at work to my happiness, outcomes based accountability. Where you figure out some broad, generic outcomes that you want to achieve: to be more healthy, happy and productive in my case. And then work back to what you should do to achieve these: exercising for at least 200minutes a week, seeing friends regularly, setting aside time for hobbies etc etc.. And then defining how you will know if you have achieved these (measurable indicators, so easy for minutes of exercise, a bit vaguer for social and happiness indicators but you can get quite good proxies) it's pretty dry, but it really helped me focus on the steps I needed to take to get to my broader outcomes. There's more you can do with the tool over time - after building a solid baseline you can be more reflexive for example about habits / patterns </TEXT>

<TEXT> For casual sex they don't need it any more than men - that being said, in western culture in general men and women see an emotional connection as important for a long term relationship, so depending on what someone is looking for it is more or less important. I guess it's about context  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first house I remember living in with my family was a rented 1 bed room back to back flat in a shitty neighbourhood where we all slept in 1 room and got burgled on a semi-regular basis. At this time my dad ran his business out of a garage, had no employees and my mum had to work nights to make ends meet. By the time I was 12 they owned a 4 bed semi detached house in a desirable location, and my dads business had relocated to a large showroom and workshop space and had 5 permanent members of staff. Really quite impressive when I think about it, makes me grateful to have seen both sides.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like the theme coming out in a lot of these comments, of a kind of rebelliousness that the customer will probably not notice, but allows the server to feel they've got a little one up on them without doing anything that could risk their job - reminds me of studying Scott in anthropology, acts of everyday resistance </TEXT>

<TEXT> Worked in a few hospitality roles, would never spit in someone's food! But the coffee shop I worked in I'd sometimes deliberately make a rude customers order wrong - not so they'd notice necessarily but so I'd feel a bit better after they'd been super rude. Like using full fat milk for the skinny latte of the woman who would come in talking on her phone, not properly look at me and always make me wait for ages with her change in my hand, or swapping out decaf for caffeinated, that kind of thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd mostly agree with the comments here - I solo travelled and travelled with another female friend in Morocco a few years back. Food is amazing, people are on the whole friendly and very welcoming to tourists. A couple of the places I really enjoyed visiting were fez and chefchouen up in the north of the country. And spending a night in the desert with the bedouins is really worth it if you have the time, there are a few package-type trips you can book through agents in Marrakesh. 
On the whole buses are cheap and pretty reliable way to get around, there isn't much of a train network so unless you can drive or find some other travellers to split a taxi with it's also your only option.
I wouldn't be too nervous about booking places before you go - definitely preferable to have somewhere lined up at least for your first few days rather than finding somewhere when you arrive. There isn't really a hostel culture like in Europe, but you can find cheap places to stay that are pretty basic amenity-wise.
Like has already been mentioned you will be asked for money a lot - haggling is part of the culture and you have to stand your ground about what you're willing to pay/ agree prices before any services are provided. 
The only other thing to be aware of is that I dressed very modesty, trousers and long sleeved shirts, and I still found that I attracted a lot of male attention, some of it very unpleasant. I'm not really sure what the best advice about this is, it is obviously just a small minority of men but I was cat called, followed and groped, in broad daylight in busy touristy areas in Marrakesh and elsewhere. I don't want to sound scaremongery, but just have your wits about you, and if you need directions or help try to approach women or families.

<TEXT> As a renter it's the little details that suggest a poor level of upkeep or a landlord/agency that won't fix things that really put me off. If you can't be bothered to repaint a dirty wall or repair a kitchen cabinet before looking for new renters then my confidence is lost. Similarly, there are certain agencies in my city that I would just never rent through no matter how nice the apartment due to personal experience and other word of mouth reviews about their total lack of regard for tenants. </TEXT>
