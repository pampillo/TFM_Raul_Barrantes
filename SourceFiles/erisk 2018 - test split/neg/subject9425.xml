<TEXT> Well, listening to it. Personally I find it easier to digest and get involved when listening to the book rather than read it myself.

My god this book was fantastic. The twists and turns had me on edge, and the characters were all unique in their own way. The development of each character was superb, from the people to the companies.

The plot was fantastic, and all in all, would rate it 10/10.
It probably did help that I was already into sci fi, aliens and space. But this book put the idea of ET life existing

If there are any similar books like this one, please do share. I was thinking of Contact by Carl Sagan, but I'll get your input first </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, i struggle to stick to a schedule. I am supposed to be studying 20 hours a week for my maths, but i work nights on a flexible contract, this basically means they can just say i need you to work this night.

The work i do prevents me from going regularly to the gym, and i just want to relax and sleep whenever i get in.
On days off i have to rearrange my sleep pattern to cater to be awake throughout the day, this in itself is a challenge.

What pro tips do you have that will help me stick to a schedule? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys, this was my first attempt at prepping. It will last me 3 days.

Chicken Meal

* **Sliced Chicken** *(Frozen, Pre Cooked)* - 166g
* **Green beans** - 125g
* **Cherry Tomatoes** - 5 (I didnt weigh it, I just added a number)
* **Green Pesto** - 40g

This is my favourite meal, inspired by the gif (will link) recipe. Super delicious, super cheap.

Steak Meal

* **Sliced Steak** - 80-100g (got a pack of four at 365g)
* **Asparagus Spears** - 4-6 Spears
* **Cherry Tomatoes** - 5

If you guys have any advice with this meal I'd really love it, it was quite a boring one, so anything will help.

All in all, it will last me 3 days. Ill have the Chicken for lunches, and the Steak for dinner.

All cooked in one pan :) (Yes i washed it)

I began by focusing on my back and cervical spine more, as well as doing 'back to wall arm raises'. I also really wanted to do handstands and I couldn't with the back i had. So shoulder strengthening and trapezius strengthening helped massively.

All in all i owe it to the /r/bodyweightfitness community as they have a TON of help on this sort of stuff </TEXT>

<TEXT> What's up MPS. I'm in a bit of a predicament at the moment, I'm living at home with my parents and am very involved in fitness, absolutely love it, however my diet hasn't always been the best.

Last week i asked my mum and dad if we could actually start eating cleanly as i want to gain weight, I'm 75kg at the moment aiming for 85kg. Long story short i got told "no."

Now the only way to help keep my diet in check is to cook for myself which means buying everything of course.

Now i live in the UK and i have a budget of about 60 a week as I'm saving up to go to college. I have pretty much all the equipment to cook with at home, but i want to know;

What cheap and healthy plates can you prepare with a low budget, and what would the shopping list look like?

Many thanks. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A small guide for people starting UVHM as Gunzerker </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Before beginning UVHM continue to play through PT 2.5 by farming Boll and Savage Lee for the fastball and the Unkempt Harold. Try get a corrosive shock and fire version of the Fastball.

Start UVHM and immediately start the Tiny Tina DLC. Progress to get the mission The Beard Makes The Man for the Grog Nozzle.

You may be about level 53 by now but don't worry.

Make sure you're specced into:

  Down not out

  Yippee ki yay

  Double your fun

  I'm ready already

  Got some

  Money shot

The Grog Nozzle will scale to your level so all you have to do is farm a new UH and FastBall whenever they become obsolete.

A sham shield will help sponge some damage but it isn't too important as you'll be getting tonnes of heals from the Grog Nozzle.

Hope this helps :)

Edit:

<TITLE> I spoke to 8 random people today... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-20 12:53:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> ... well, partially random... Let me explain

So I am involved in a multi level marketing business, and part of that involves talking to people, but I'm not good at that. Been in the business 5 months have made 0 progress. Today I decided to take a step forward.

Okay so here's what I did. I went to my local town centre, went into random shops and stopped people while they were working.

Now you might say what if they had a lot of stuff to do? Well here's the thing, people on shop floors are very much there to help!

Here was my script "hi, can I just stop you for a minute" now usually they'll say - sure! Or "How can I help?"

I always respond with "I know it's very random, but I'm trying to talk to 10 people today." Now it is important to stop and listen to them too as a conversation takes two people. Stopping there will prompt them to respond with something. Usually they'll ask why you want to talk to ten people - fantastic!

"I'm just doing some hands in personal development to help me talk to people and come out of my shell." Now I'm being very honest here, I am doing exactly that. And you would be surprised what could spark from that little answer.

Now it is important to always wish them a good day, you want them to feel good too! The first person I spoke to looked very happy after I said "have a fantastic day!".

So that's 8 people today, not quite ten, but it's 8 more than I would've thought I could've spoken to. You just got to say "Fuck it" really.

If the formatting is a bit awkward, apologies, I'm on mobile.

Have an amazing day everyone! </TEXT>

<TITLE> How to install lots of mods very quick! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-03 11:55:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey everyone,

So the point of this guide is for those who want to play with lots of mods but your computer is too old/slow for Curse client to run.

What you will need:

* **Curse Client**
* **Minecraft Mods Folder** 
* **Mods** (Downloaded through Curse)


Okay.



1. Open Curse and navigate to MInecraft

2. Click Create modpack (Name it whatever, and use the version you want to install your mods to.) The client will automatically install forge, but you may need to install it on your original.

3. Click the image to view the profile

4. In the top right corner it says **"GET MORE CONTENT"**, click that and search for mods you want. If the mod requires a core, it will automatically be downloaded

5. Go back to the overview of the profile you just created.

6. Next to where it says **"GET MORE CONTENT"** there is an ellipses button, click that then click **Open Folder**

7. Have the created modpack folder and your original minecraft folder open.

8. Drag all the mods from curse folder into your original

9. Enjoy :)

**NOTE:** Curse does not have Optifine, so it will have to be installed normally.

Done. </TEXT>

A couple weeks back i got a message from my mate telling me my steam account got hacked. This was my fault as i didnt have Steam Guard. I have it back, and have reenabled steam guard.

Now weird stuff is happening to my email. Im receiving emails with message undelivered, but nothing has been sent from my email. I Have liked the imgur posts to see what im on about. I didnt block the other email addresses simply because they dont exist. [Album](http://imgur.com/a/fLwwn)

I have logged every other computer out from my account, and changed all my passwords. What should I do?

Thank you </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay I think I fucked up. About a month a go I tried rooting my P9. Now to root it, we have to unlock bootloader and use an external program outside of supersu and kingroot. So I unlocked bootloader installed the recovery mode, then I went to install xposed. Softbricked the phone.

I restored the phone but bootloader is unlocked still and apparently I'm still rooted.

Features I can't do: remove system administrator, use Snapchat (having to use Casper), change background images, install customer recovery. Those are what I've found so far.

I've tried to relock bootloader, but to no avail. So I looked up a factory version of the phone but I don't know how to install it. Or if it would even work.

Is there anything I can do to get my phone back to what it was, or am I screwed?

<TEXT> Hey everyone I don't know if this is the correct sub for this but I need some help.

For a good year now, we've been planning a holiday to Croatia and my ex is there too. Now me and my ex have been on good terms since we broke up about 9 months ago.
Recently I've been really missing what we had, I walked her home plenty of times in the 9 months, and we always have a laugh.
Anyway I told a friend that I miss her and that even though we're going on holiday together in July.
Now a rumour is going around saying that I'm going to "get her alone and do something to her"
I only found out about this because my ex confronted me.
All I want to know is who said it; I don't want to do anything to them, I just want to stay away from them, but if I don't find out who it is, then my whole holiday is going to be awkward as fuck.
I need some advice on what to do :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, so 2 minutes ago I walked out of the gym in a really shitty way. I was doing the RR and I thought, instead of a wall plank, I'll do a stomach-to-wall handstand. Got in the position but after about 15-20 seconds I began to feel weak in the shoulders so I tried to dismount. Instead of elegantly twisting to a sit down, I shuffled forward and my right shoulder twisted and crunched. It hurt for a good 2-3 minutes but then I said sod it and went to do the dip bar balance, where I had to stop.

I feel bad because I didn't finish my workout and I feel worse because my fucking shoulder kills </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today was the first time doing a completely bodyweight workout. I have to admit I feel achy but I feel amazing, which I haven't felt coming out from the gym in a long time. I did the recommended routine using the app. The reason I done it? Well I'm 18 years old and have been hitting the gym 4 times a week, but haven't noticed any improvements. I am on /r/fitness quite a bit mainly lurking, and have always known about this sub but was too eh to give it a go. But yesterday I was looking on YouTube at calisthenics routines, and found a lot of success stories, more than any other routine or method; also a few that I saw were younger than me!

<TEXT> Okay so I'm not fussed about a meaning of a tattoo, but I really like the idea of adding colour to my full white skin.

Now I've never had a tattoo and I am young (turned 18 in October) but do you guys have a really cool concept of a first tattoo?

I was going to go with something with things I like (tardis; space; avatar TLA; gym; etc) but I can't seem to think of something good.

I have been thinking about getting a tattoo for well over a year now and I genuinely feel as if I should; it's just a matter of what and where I guess.

So what are your tips, and thank you for your help! Cheers! </TEXT>

Since Christmas I've been hitting the gym at least 3 days a week where I do only upper body as I cycle 5 days a week. During this time I was just winging it with the weight as I didn't know how to find my 1RM because I don't know what my potential is.
So how would I find my 1RM? Would I get help? Would I just say "try 100kg bench"? How would I go about doing it?

Cheers </TEXT>

I usually climb my hills on a high gear (I don't know which) because it's easier for me than climbing on a low one, but after the hill, I go much slower and my legs get tired quicker.
Is this normal/does it happen to you? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, I just want to share with you a little story

So about a year ago I was "going" to a gym where I live. There was always 4 people doing weights and the rest of the resistance was just machines. A lot of them. I was always put off by the people who would use the gym as an ego test, which was very common; while people were exercising, there were the others walking about with their snapbacks on and their super tight track suits wearing white Nike air max. This was a very toxic environment to me, and the problem was is that it was all people my age at the time 16-18. So after only going about 5 times in a month I decided to just not go to that gym.
I read a lot of stories on /r/fitness and every time I do, it makes me want to go to the gym. I have a very friendly gym environment now, the instructors aren't egotists, and the facilities as a whole are a lot better. It's a 15 minute walk, 3 minute drive, or 5 minute cycle, easily accessible on the way home from work. People who go to this gym are middle aged people, super friendly, super healthy, and super fit.
So I started going properly again at the end of December, hitting about 4-5 times a week on average, sometimes 7 times a week, and even if the workouts that I am doing aren't making an impact (which they are), it just feels good to be in a good environment.
So the start of January I weighed in at 81kg, 17.1% BF. I am now 76kg and 16% BF. And my general build is better. 
So the things that had a positive effect were
Changing gyms to a more local, friendly one

Its not far 11km, but as someone who isnt speciallised in cardio, its super tough. Last week was my first week, and on wednesday i was a little late because i wasnt prepared for the fatigue, and got so much shit for it. Also they knew i was supposed to be eating high amounts of protein, now i get shit for eating carbs and less protein.
Point is, I'm the healthiest person where I work, and everyone else is trying to determine how I eat, and give me shit for trying to cycle in and get to work early. Pisses me off </TEXT>

<TITLE> Need advice on cycling everyday </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-04 01:18:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi there; firstly I'd like to start by saying I know it isn't healthy to exercise everyday, but hear me out.
So for the pas couple months I've been getting the bus to work, doing so is very unreliable as I've been late a solid 80% of the time. So this week I said no, I'm going to cycle because I can get to work quicker; and it's true, it takes about 20 minutes less. Anyway, I don't have too far to travel; only 10-12 km depending on the route I take; but to work it's about 35% downhill to 50% uphill and 15% flat. Even then, the hills aren't massive, but they are unavoidable.
So this morning when I cycled to work, it took about 15 minutes longer as my quads were exhausted. What techniques do you have to overcome this?
I'm using a road bike, nothing special, but it's about 3-4kg I think, so it's not much to push. I have to carry extra work clothes and showering stuff so it's about an extra 10kg on my back.
Thank you </TEXT>

<TITLE> What is a good workout routine to become a mesomorph? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-25 20:58:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, so I'm an 18 year old male; I did sport studies at GCSE and began to do A level sport studies. During my A Levels I stopped exercising and lost what could be described as the ectomorph/mesomorph build. I wasn't ripped or anything like that.
 Anyway, I don't know what I did to get there, but whatever I did I enjoyed it. I used to workout with my mate, and us being 15/16 was focused on lifting, which, yeah it helped, but we had a routine. In the end I lost that routine and began to decline in fitness.
 I've been watching a lot of Joe Weller (British youtuber) and he has the type of build that I'm aiming for. I know it's not an overnight thing and it may take a good year before seeing some results.
These are some rough numbers
  6"0 tall
  85 kg
  15% body fat
  Can run at 13 kmh for about 5 minutes
  Can lift about 9 kg Dumbbells and do a fair amount of exercise
  Can bench about 35kg
  Can't row
  Can cycle

I also have asthma which is why my long distance running is not so good. I am earning, but after payouts I only get about 200 of which I'm going to start using on a healthy diet, as I currently just eat anything. I will buy a kg of whey protein to repair the muscles after a good workout
 I absolutely love going to the gym, every time I'm there I try my hardest to the point of nearly being sick.
What is a good workout routine and eating routine for the goals that I want to get. I know I wasn't very specific about what I want to achieve.
Will post pictures if needed
Thank you

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, I live in the UK and am looking for a new computer, so i thought, why not build one. I dont earn a lot of money, currently 660 per month, since I'm only an apprentice. So what I'm looking for is a build that costs around 200 - 250. I dont *need* any keyboard or mouse, but it would be nice.
What im looking for is a computer that can run a game like BL2 on the normal settings, without dropping below 30 fps.
Im currently on an HP 2022UK and it is just awful when it comes to games.
Im not planning on buying every component right away, because i simply cant afford it, but my next payday is on christmas eve, so hopefully i can get the more expensive parts around then.
So Im just looking for a build that costs around 250, and can run games such as Borderlands 2 smoothly, on regular settings. Thank you </TEXT>

Fucking bastards kept me working for another hour and a half whilst I was in serious fucking pain. I had to go to A E and get the blisters popped, the doctor said they were second degree. During the time after the accident I was the only one on the tills, and we had a fuck tonne of customers come in, and I couldn't do shit. I just waited until everyone came off their breaks. Thank fuck I left. </TEXT>

Rotm = glacors, dbane. World wakes (full) = 6th ac, automatons, bunch of free exp, new abilities. Fotg = nihils, t75 div, muspahs. Even the easier quests can give great rewards, such as the replayables (dod, haunted house quest) dark light upgrade ( granted not as good as before)  and surgeon ring, t85 power ring, great for bossing.

<TEXT> There isn't really much, and I don't want to be the guy to say it, bust it has to be slayer. Armadyl God wars is a fantastic way, since legs and chest are hitting ~4m. Unfortunately most end game content is what brings in the cash. Automatons are nice, 67 slayer requirement except all those quests. If you have a legendary pet, set scavenge on, arm them until you get a drop, gloves are about 7m which is nice. I'm not a very efficient money maker, can stay stable at around 7m. Just kill things that have an expensive drop or slayer really </TEXT>

<TITLE> Drifting away... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-24 00:31:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So as people in Britain who are doing A Levels know, public exams start in about 9 days. I have my first exam on the 5th, and I'm not sure what for, hopefully C1 maths... Anyway, so at the start of the year, actually on the 31st of December, I bought a year membership.
 Now at first I was like yeah this is a great idea, but then as it came closer to exam season I began to realise what I'd done. 
Now don't get me wrong, I love the game, I really do, but I have seen myself just logging in, using keys, logging out. The game isn't getting boring, I'm just getting bored, I'm focussed on levelling stuff up and not actually enjoying the game. In all fairness a lot of the enjoyment was from quests, and after achieving QP Cape, I felt like a weight was off my shoulders, because I enjoyed it, but I wanted it done.
 Now what I'm trying to say is, don't think you HAVE to play the game. Runescape doesn't have to be a commitment, and if you see it that way, fair enough, but if you have other things that are more important, don't choose runescape over that.
 Tomorrow my Sport Studies course work gets sent off to moderation. I left 3 essays to the last minute. I had to complete 3 essays in these last two days, and get them marked, and from what I know, only one of them is good. If I hadn't prioritised runescape, I would've done excellent. 
Despite this, I'm not quitting runescape, I'm letting it dissipate for until I want to play it again, and it feels good.
For anyone about to sit public exams, I hope you haven't been as stupid as I have. Runescape is fun and all, but you need to prioritise.
Also as a side note; go to the gym, exercising will release a hormone called serotonin, which is known as the feel good hormone. His is similar to what is released playing games. Go to the gym, because you never know, you might get addicted :3
Thank you to the rs3 community for being so good, I'm always on this sub reddit browsing, and I can't wait to see the legacy mashup arrive, but as for now, I'll see you when I see you </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I started playing nearly 8 years ago, and if you do the math, that was in 2007, but the problem is, I forgot what I'd done. I began training slayer, and I'm hitting nothing on monkeys. So I need help, I'm willing to train any combat skill but preferably range (I prefer it over melee and Mage)
 The reason I'm training slayer is to make money, it's what I done on rs3 and i was able to buy 92 herb and 95 prayer. Will this work on 07 because I know it's a lot harder to make money
 I don't want to get into questing yet as I'm too low level, but if there is any that are a necessity, I'll do it
Thanks for your help </TEXT>

<TEXT> okay then, so what are we left with? Bossing? QBD for instance. ~200k per kill. Without t70 armour, super antifire, you'll be averaging about 4 minutes a kill. and you might be able to squeeze two kills in/trip. that'll cut down your profits by ~30-40k/invent. Assuming constant 165k/kill, about 5 minutes with banking youll be getting 1,980,000gp/hr. Then add in the deaths. W/o all that youll be getting maybe 700k, because unless you're a pro, you're going to die a lot.
Now lets assume that you had done slayer, you'd be able to afford t70 armour, and 85 herb. You'd be averaging 2:10 maybe 2:20/kill off task. thats ~23-26 kills per hour w/o banking. put banking in there, youd be able to get about 5/6 kills per trip, thats about 4 banks per hour. assuming banking takes a minute. 4/6=1/3, 20 seconds per kill per bank. That is still a maximum of 24 kills per hour. and because of longer trips, you'd be using less supplies so each kill you'll profit about ~190k. Assuming 22 kills/hour that's 4,180,000gp/hr.
So just by training slayer you are able to afford T70 armour and 85 herb, which made it possible for you to earn 2 more million per hour just at QBD. Thats a 1:2 nonslayer:slayer ratio. So yeah you could say that slayer is useless, but you'd just be wrong. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you don't like meleeing a task, but it's a demon task, use a darklight, and if you haven't done so already, upgrade it. The upgrade makes tasks so much quicker, and much more fun imo. You can even use the darklight at waterfiends!

<TEXT> So after being someone who does use portables often, its a common occurrence that people come over and just place a Marker Plant. Its all fine if there are few people there, but when there's a butt-load, it becomes a nuisance having to go all the way down.
 What could be done is remove the left click option for the person who **DIDNT** put the plant down, and have it show for the person who did. 
 Thank you  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-03-06 15:47:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey everyone;
 So I've had a gym membership for two months now, and have only been four times, in the first week.
 I had lost the motivation to go to the gym, and really need to get it back
 In the summer two years ago I bulked up a bit, gained about 10 kg in muscle, and maintained that up until recently.
 I usually have a high metabolism and recently I've notice that declining.
 I'm 17 years old and currently doing my A Levels in PE, ICT, and Maths, so I'm quite knowledgable on how to train
 I just can't seem to be motivated to go to the gym, and it's on my way down from school everyday.
 Another thing is work, I haven't had any work for 6 weeks because of McDonald's are toxic as hell, even though I seemed to be more active then, going to the gym at around that point. I have my first shift again on Sunday.
 I need to be able to show that I can do a 100m sprint, and have an 8 week report ( which I'll probably only do 4 and double it ) so I know what to train, it's just motivation
 As well as this, I have become addicted to playing runescape again and can't seem to put it down
Can I please have your hints on motivation, because right now I feel like shit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So for those who have done the quest, you'll know you'll have to kill Arrav. At this point Arrav came invulnerable to me, and I lured him to the Rock and he was still invulnerable. Is this a glitch? Or do I have to wait it out? I teleported out and I'm going back tomorrow (only computer is occupied(#expwaste))
 Also, this doesn't bother me now since it's over, but after I kill two ice demons, the rest were invulnerable to me but not to sir tiffy and whoever else, so I waited it out? Is this supposed to happen?

 So I have done nearly all the quests I need to start while guthix sleeps, only a few short ones, but the requirement is 65 farming, and as I'm Aware it can be boosted, according to the wikia anyway.
 So currently I'm at 54 farming and I need ~200k farming exp.
 I look at the guides on YouTube and don't understand them, so what I'm asking is, how do you guys level up farming at around my level, and what are your techniques; farm runs, times to do a run, and the fastest possible exp. Thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm no pro myself but the way I get by, I trained slayer, picking up every drop with a value of at least 1k. Drops like this are extremely common in slayer. With this your level will increase and you'll be able to kill things that are greater xp AND gp an hour. With your already amassed amount of cash I'd highly recommend making investments into t70 gwd armour, so combat is a lot easier. If you get to 81 slayer, you'll have access to Rorarri, which you'll earn anywhere between 300k-5m doing.
 From 1-81 slayer you'll have amassed well over 20m and can afford higher tier weaponry. Now you can skill and get money, 85 mining for rune ore, 10k per ore
There are plenty of methods but I recommend doing slayer, it'll be your best bet.
 If you want to know other money making methods, try looking at the runescape wikia
Sorry for long post
TL;Dr; slayer and wikia and skill </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's mainly lore and rewards orientated.
In some quests, not going to name them, dungeoneering is required and you explore a dungeon during it, but it's still minor
If you're looking at it at a what's the point in it, then just fun, I mean what's the point in smithing or fletching, they basically have a few quests and allow you to make stuff. I know those two are more rewarding in some aspects however
But if you do look at dungeoneering from a rewards point of view, it's one of the most useful skills in the game, with resource dungeons and high level weaponry for f2p and p2p.
If you're asking why you should train it, it's fun, don't set yourself a goal though, it'll only become a grind </TEXT>

<TEXT> When you say you're fit, you're fit for one particular activity, and, in no offence, probably isn't running, and that's probably why you hit around 90% HR. however if you're doing 90% then you're working anaerobically, so what I suggest, is to train running.
 Source: currently studying a level pe, the definition of fit is to meet the demands of the environment without  undue fatigue.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but in one of the rooms during the world wakes; might be the first; there's a sword which is said to be a guthixian godsword; so perhaps we could get one, but I don't think so considering guthix is dead

<TEXT> Okay I'd just like to clarify, I have used avast for years now, there's never been anything wrong with it, so I see no reason to switch, however we do use norton antivirus as well. I've been playing runescape on client for quite a while now, and this Trojan warning only popped up yesterday, now I don't know why it happened, but I reinstalled the client completely, uninstalled it from the system, reinstalled it from website. Now it still doesn't work, so my conclusion is now to play on the browser, but I'm going to see if I can fix the problem, and allow the antivirus to let it run.
 TL;DR got two antivirus', avast only recognised it, reinstalled the game, still happened, going to block it on avast </TEXT>

Step 1; kill cows, chickens(bones), mining, woodcutting upto 150k or so, enough to buy full rune

Step 2; kill cockroach soldiers upto 1m or so

Step 3; buy clean harralander and some vials of water, before you ask, this is possible as herblore can be train to level 5. This technique can sometimes double or triple your money, I did this upto my first bond </TEXT>

56 Axton

I have numerous under levelled characters but I'd like to restart my Gaige from level 1

I know all legendary drops so if you advise legendaries, I can farm for them. I also have all DLC except the creature slaughter dome. </TEXT>
