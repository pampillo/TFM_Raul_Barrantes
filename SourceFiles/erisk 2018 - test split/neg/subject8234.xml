<TEXT> I took a look, and the statistics they ran on the responses to this question really looked like it was a decent measure, with a Cronbach's alpha of .85. I understand your frustration, but I think it's still an interesting study- this study could be picking up on an effect from confidence; men who are more confident and are feeling more masculine might just be better partners. I agree that this study is by no means conclusive, but I think it's a good start with some merits to its method.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Grad student in cognitive neuroscience here. This title is misleading- they did not find that damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex or the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was linked to an increase in religious fundamentalism. Actually, they found that regardless of whether patients had damage to the vmPFC or the dlPFC, they still exhibited religious fundamentalism. Instead, the takeaway from this article is that the vmPFC may contribute to fundamentalist beliefs via cognitive flexibility. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This study is a meta analysis that set out to clarify causal directions of the analgesic effects of alcohol, as previous literature had been divided. This meta-analysis identified 18 previous studies to include in analysis. Studies included met five different criteria: (1) adults given a controlled dose of alcohol, (2) a comparative no-alcohol group/condition, (3) medically and neurologically healthy participants, (4) an experimental pain stimulus, and (5) were published in international peer-reviewed journals or conference abstracts. Studies with patients with a history of alcohol abuse were excluded. Pain threshold and intensity were utilized in various paradigms by all included studies. The results of this meta analysis showed overall pain threshold was elevated following alcohol administration, although this was a small effect. There was a much larger effect of reduction of pain intensity. Additionally, every .02% increment in blood alcohol content was associated with heightened analgesia for both pain thresholds and intensity. Authors note that the heightened reductions in pain intensity following alcohol administration likely explain why people with chronic pain abuse alcohol.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They note in a comment at the bottom of the page that doing this didn't change the results of any of the studies they reported. I'm guessing that they excluded these people for missing data, as missing data is often a problem with online studies, where people start a survey and don't ever finish it. Sometimes, there's reason to believe that a bot completed the questionnaire, which has been a problem on M-Turk, so that may be another reason why.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that there is still some debate on how to use M-Turk samples. Most people advocate caution with M-Turk samples, because data from M-Turk isn't always reliable. [Here's](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Steven_Rouse/publication/268803960_A_reliability_analysis_of_Mechanical_Turk_data/links/54ecbd330cf27fbfd7717b49.pdf) a study detailing some of the issues with M-Turk data. I think we might want to be more careful about generalizing results from this study, but I don't think using M-Turk is a "deal breaker" or anything. It is pretty widely used in social science research, from what I can tell. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This study concerned the *perceptions* of black men vs. white men. While we might see differences in actual physical ability, that's beside the point. The authors wanted to see if there were differences in perceptions, in large part due to police violence. I'm not sure if you can see this, but [here's](http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspi0000092.pdf) a PDF of the full article. The cultural values I was referencing were noted by the authors as a possible reason for this disparity in perceptions of whites and blacks. Hope that helps! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This study was conducted by researchers who hypothesized that a person's race would influence perceptions of his physical size. This study was conducted in a number of sub-parts. In the first part, participants were given 200 photographs of male faces (100 white and 100 black) and were asked to estimate the height and weight of each person. They found that black males were consistently rated as being significantly taller and heavier than white males. In another part, participants were given faces of white and black males, and asked to choose a body that would match each face. They found that black males were consistently given more muscular bodies than white males were. In a final part, participants were shown white and black male faces, and asked to rate how strong they thought each person was, on a scale from 0-7. They found that participants, on average, rated black males as being stronger than white males. The authors noted in their discussion of results that even black participants showed this bias, although to a lesser degree than white participants did. They suggest this may be due to a partial internalization of cultural values.

<TEXT> Hello- thanks for doing this AMA!
I'm interested in the pathophysiology behind spatial disorientation, and whether multiple types of dementia present with this problem. I've read that spatial disorientation is not a memory problem, which would rule out medial temporal lobe atrophy. Do you normally see patients with spatial disorientation that have frontal lobe atrophy? I'm also wondering whether certain types of dementia are more likely to involve spatial disorientation. Are there any treatments that help with this issue? 

Thanks for your time! </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a psychology graduate student, I hear about the replication crisis a lot. Most I've talked to feel like the replication problems come from smaller-than-ideal sample sizes. One thing I've been trying to push in my own research is a priori power analyses. My current project is a neuroimaging project, so we did a g*power analysis and came up with a sample size large enough to have sufficient statistical power. I really hope this sort of thing becomes more common in the future. I think most of the problems with sample size and selection could be helped by doing these types of power analyses.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Overwatch is SO much better than IW. Essentially, as you level up, you get loot boxes with random skins/customizations and coins to buy the ones you want. Competitive is really fun, you work your way through the ranks and are given points for each game you finish. Using these points you can buy special golden weapons for your favorite heroes. There are lots of game modes and they just added custom servers so you can really play how you want to. Blizzard is constantly adding content, rumors are that a new hero is coming pretty soon. I feel like there's enough heroes that I don't get bored and if I ever do, I switch to another hero I'm not as good at to practice and freshen things up. I'm about 100 hours in now and i'm still not bored with things. COD pales in comparison IMO. Overwatch is 100% worth the money </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys,

I posted here a while back. I'm a grad student at BYU who isn't mormon. The culture here is kind of driving me crazy. I know coming to BYU as a non-mormon probably wasn't the greatest idea, but I didn't know any better at the time. Are there any ex/non-mormons on here who'd want to meet up sometime? I really want to meet some normal people again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi all, 

Thanks for doing this AMA! I'm a graduate student in psychology and have been studying some replication studies of classic psychology experiments. Although this is not your field, I wanted to ask your opinion on how much you think replication problems in science, not purely psychology or social sciences, relates to lack of understanding of methodologies/statistical tests. How can we educate researchers to conduct better/more robust studies? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nope. I didn't play either 1 or 2 and I still loved it. There are some videos online that summarize the events in 1 and 2 if you're interested in the lore.

<TEXT> Okay, let's be real here. Skyrim is great. It's fun. But IMO there's not much substance. Plus, the game has been out for five years so chances are you've played it already. 

Witcher 3 is quite possibly the best RPG I've ever played. Everything is so intertwined. Even the side quests have ties into other side quests and the main storyline. The characters are so developed you feel sort of empty when they disappear post game. The blood and wine DLC adds 40 hours of gameplay and is actually better than the main game in my opinion. If you haven't played witcher, you need to.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Ira! Thanks for doing this AMA. 

I'm a graduate student in psychology- lately I've been concerned about the anti science rhetoric in our government, especially coming from President-Elect Trump. He has mentioned that he'd like to stop funding things like social science research. As someone who works to bridge the gap between the public and science, do you have any thoughts on what we as researchers can do to combat this anti-science attitude among not only our government officials, but the public? How can we make our work more accessible and help others realize its importance?

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello,

Thanks for doing this AMA! 

I have a family friend who was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme last year. In the course of his treatment, he was given a new therapy technique that involves the use of a skull-cap with electrodes that emit a static electric field, combined with a new drug, to try and halt tumor growth. This technique was written about in this paper: 

http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2475463?resultClick=3

So far, it looks like the therapy has stopped (for the most part) the growth of the tumor. I'm wondering what your thoughts are on new treatments like these- are there any other promising treatments for cancer on the horizon? How seriously should we take these kinds of treatment? 

Thanks for your time! </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the things I've faced most often in my education is the idea from other people that psychology isn't a science. I think this is hard to stamp out because lay people generally don't/can't hypothesize/make conclusions about the properties of an atom, or quantum forces- psychology is a field that is accessible enough to the lay person that people make assumptions about the field, and subsequently what is/isn't true about people, and this causes other scientists to conclude that because of this science/public interaction, all psychologists really do is guesswork, because(in their view) the entire field is based off of subjective self-reports. I think this actually puts psychologists in a unique position, though- because psychology is somewhat accessible to the public, public outreach might actually do something to quell common myths and stereotypes (like the 10% brain myth). With other fields, like medicine, the processes underlying certain practices (like vaccines) are so mysterious that people automatically assume something nefarious is going on, and because people aren't physicians, they don't truly understand why this isn't the case. I think if psychologists focused more on public education, we might actually be able to gain some respect among other scientists and combat this idea of psychology being a pseudo-science.

<TEXT> This study examined activation of the anterior cingulate gyrus and the orbitofrontal cortex, before and after injection of a common method of birth control, Depo (or Depo Medroxyprogesterone Acetate). Using a 3-T MRI scanner, participants brain activity was examined in response to high-calorie, low-calorie, and neutral stimuli. These scans were performed before injection of Depo and 8 weeks after a 150mg dose of Depo. Researchers noted that there was increased activation in the orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus, areas associated with reward and food motivation. While no fat mass increase was noted post-injection, this study could be important because it links injection of Depo to increased activation in food motivation and reward areas. This could be a mechanism in which subjects find themselves more prone to eating more after a Depo injection.

<TEXT> Sure, but I don't think that's what the study is suggesting. Its been found that certain birth control medications can be associated with weight gain- this study just demonstrates that this particular method of birth control may be partially responsible for weight gain by increasing the activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, an area commonly associated with food motivation. Of course eating is the cause of weight gain, but change in eating habits may be linked to birth control.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A quick literature search didn't show many studies investigating specifically TBI and Domestic Violence. From what I can tell, it seems that most studies in the past have listed TBI as a potential health consequence of DV, but have not specifically investigated TBIs sustained as a result of DV. Here's one of the few papers on this topic i could find: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937803003582

It seems as though DV wasn't even considered as a public health problem until about 10 years ago- I think OP's study is important because it establishes a firm connection between DV and TBI, and it provides future policy makers and researchers in the field a foundation to build on. If research finds that TBI is often caused by DV, we may be able to better help women (and men) who are victims of DV by screening them for TBI, and giving them treatment for that in addition to what treatments are already provided. Also, considering that TBI is often comorbid with other disorders, such as PTSD, realizing that DV victims may have TBI could allow professionals a new perspective on how to treat the mental health symptoms that often accompany DV. 

Here's a paper that talks about the convergence of PTSD and TBI:

My advice is to apply to graduate programs near where you're interested by the deadlines this fall (usually Dec). If that means retaking the GRE, allow yourself enough time to do that. Finish the school year where you're at, and if you still aren't happy and get an offer from somewhere you'd like to go more, then accept it and leave.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It really depends on where you're applying. A lot of graduate programs list some classes/work/experience they'd like their applicants to have. For psychology, mostly everyone was looking for research experience. I would start looking at the programs you want to apply to, and see if you would benefit from having the extra experience. I don't think it could hurt if you got the extra experience, and if you could get involved working with some faculty members in that quarter, I'd recommend it even more. If you're applying to Economics grad programs, being able to say on your application that you were an Economics major would probably help. I recommend you look at both the pros and cons of both, and consider which one would benefit you more. Also, try and talk to some faculty at your university about this! I'm sure they would have some more practical advice for you. </TEXT>

I don't give a shit about Primal's story, where in 4 I played through twice, one for each storyline. Everything is subbed in primal so half the time I just skip the cutscenes because I can't see the screen to read the subs. It's more challenging than 4 but I'm not immersed by it like I was in 4.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been doing research for a class and found some really interesting stuff. For instance, the amygdala (usually associated with emotion and fight/flight response) shows heightened activity and the medial prefrontal cortex (associated with executive control) shows diminished activity in people with PTSD. Researchers think that there is an "alarm" system that activates in the presence of non-consciously attended fear, and that as a result of trauma, the amygdala is over active and isn't being inhibited by the medial prefrontal cortex. They think this is why people with PTSD tend to have violent fear responses all of the sudden- they're actually developing drugs and therapies to try and combat this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Start studying for the GRE now. Learn vocabulary, and review math. There's tons of guides and helpful websites. It's a tough one. I'm gonna have to retake it here pretty soon. 

Applications are good for me because I went through this process trying to apply for internships. Get with faculty you know and ask them for letters of recommendation. You've got a year, if you don't know them get to. Do some research. Shit is so competitive. You need a good CV and cover letter.

Also, save money now. GRE is 199$ here and each application costs anywhere from 50-100$. I'm applying to about 10 programs, so that's gonna cost me a good bit. 

Also, do some research into who you want to work with at universities you want to apply to. I made a table of professors I want to work with, their area of research, application deadlines and fees. Read their stuff and email them and ask them about their research and if they're accepting grad students. I did this with a guy out at Brigham Young, we're skyping this week and it's looking good so far. 

Honestly I would just say to prepare as much as you can. Don't slack off like I did.  </TEXT>

1. Fitting in movie theater seats without being uncomfortable. Before my belly would hang over the arm rests and it would annoy the fuck out of me to where i couldn't use them. I went the other day and discovered i no longer have that problem.

2. I've got a lot more confidence. I finally got around to asking out this waitress at this local cafe where I've been a regular for 7 years. Felt great.

3. I'm starting to notice little things, like walking up a long flight of stairs, isn't so difficult anymore.

4. I can see my biceps becoming more defined, and it feels great.

5. I've been getting less self-conscious, and other people have been making fat jokes a lot less.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So here's what a recent study into little Albert found, according to numerous professors I've discussed this with. 

Little Albert was videoed, and some medical experts analyzed his behavior and noticed that he most likely was nearly blind and deaf. This is troubling, because in their paper, researchers say in the last paragraph that Albert was selected for the experiment because he was a normal, average child to which a population of children could be compared to. If he truly was blind and deaf, they knowingly lied about it. The head researcher, at the time, worked on the staff of a journal being published by the university he worked at- Watson and colleagues (2007) found some documents suggesting that he pushed the paper through without going through a peer-review process.

He was born by a single mother who was a wet nurse, which was typically not very high on the food chain, and was pressured into giving Albert to researchers for this experiment. If I recall correctly, she ended up taking him out of the experiment and moving, where he eventually died around age 6.  </TEXT>

It's like skyrim, but better. Every side quest is unique, ties into the main story, and you can feel the amount of time put into the game. Not to mention they have something like 16 free DLCs coming out and a paid expansion that adds 30-40 hours of gameplay.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm currently working under the department chair as his RA and TA. I am lead author on a paper, with two other professors as coauthors, that I submitted to a journal for publication. Got another paper I'm about to submit, and I've presented at ~5 conferences so far. I actually taught two or three classes for my advisor when he was out for a week with the flu, and he told me he would be sure to include that in a letter for me. 

I guess I'm just wondering if this experience is enough to make me competitive enough to have a shot of getting in. I've got a 3.85 GPA and I'm taking the GRE in August.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically, they're asking if differences in socioeconomic status is a significant catalyst for change in the novel. Think of it this way: in Hinduism, you have a caste system:
1. Brahmans- top class, priests and teachers
2. Kshatriyas- under brahmans, nobles and warriors
3. Vaishya- merchant class 
4. Shudras- bottom class

That is a class difference. So, is the difference between the bottom class and the top class causing a movement for change? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So i just made these for lunch and i loved them. I'm calling them Mediterranean.. 

Wraps- just take any wrap (I used a low carb tortilla) and fill it with cucumber, tomato, and onion slices. I put a tablespoon of hummus and homemade cucumber sauce. Homemade hummus are even better. You can find that recipe [here](http://www.inspiredtaste.net/15938/easy-and-smooth-hummus-recipe/)

Cucumber sauce: take a cucumber and skin it. Depending on how much you want, use either half or the whole cucumber. Put it in a blender/food processor. Take plain greek yogurt and mix it with the processed cucumber. Mix in a pinch of dill and some salt, to taste. 

I did this for lunch and MFP said I was around 400 calories for two wraps. 

If that doesn't appeal to you, try doing a greek salad (I use a lemon juice/olive oil mixture for dressing), hummus, tabouli, or even stuffed grape leaves. All pretty easy and straightforward.

Basically, it's a theory that there's a bottleneck to the amount of information you can handle at once- a lot of the research I've read has to do with task switching. Not once have I ever read mention of any negative impacts on brain physiology by frequent task switching. I have zero idea where OP is getting this from.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not all IPAs are as strong as each other, but they are mainly citrusy because of the hops. Do you like hoppy beers or malty better? Because honestly there's so many out there it's hard to narrow down..  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That was my favorite at first but after I started tasting more and figured out that I love hops, i branched out and found stuff that makes that Amber pale in comparison. Bells has some killer brews, like Best Brown, but I've found that I really like Founders nowadays. Their Big Luscious and Black Rye are some of the best brews I've ever had. I also really love Shorts and their Wowee Zowee. There's this brewery near me called Tapistry Brewing that has a delicious double IPA called the Heart Full of Napalm, which is probably my favorite right now. 

TL;DR- get out there and try some more Michigan brews!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi OP,

Junior year psychology undergrad here. Considering going into cognitive neuropsychology or a similar field. Any advice on applying to graduate programs? I've already got a lot of research in (presenting at 3+ conferences this year, paper submitted for peer review), so I'm hoping that will help my chances.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just started my beer journey last year. My advice is to try as much as you can- you'll get an idea of whether or not you like IPAs, Amber or Pale Ales, hoppy vs malty.. Once you figure that out, do some research and find the best of those categories. Here's my favorites so far:

Founders Black Rye
Founders All Day IPA
Founders Big Luscious 
Bells Amber Ale
Bells Christmas Ale
Frankenmuth Christmas town
Tapistry Brewing's Heart Full of Napalm
Dark Horse Scotty Karate
Shorts Wowee Zowee
New Belgium Fat Tire

Hope this helps!

<TEXT> I assume you're pulling the intrinsic/extrinsic motivation definitions from Allport and Ross. If that's the case, I don't really agree. Allport and Ross basically assumed that intrinsic and extrinsic motivations determined human behavior without taking into account any other extraneous variables. Human motivation is so much more complex than this theory allows. Imo, it pretty much limits motivations to intrinsic or extrinsic causes. I just cannot see how that's all there is to it. 

I recently did a study on the relationship between religiosity and perceived levels of stress. I used an intrinsic/extrinsic religiosity scale but none of the subscales explained any of the variance for the stress scores. I used an internalization scale instead, which predicted somewhere around 30-40% of the variance. Internalization basically means that you move a belief or view from the external, to the internal, where you truly believe it. It's like comparing following Christ because you believe in him to following him out of peer pressure or guilt. 

Anyway, I just think that internalization of beliefs are waay more important than extrinsic/intrinsic values when discussing human motivation. As far as the purposes of serotonin and dopamine go, I don't really know the answer to that- it would be really interesting to see if there were any correlations. Have you done a literature search? That might hold some answers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Native Louisianaian here. 
Let's be honest- Cafe Du Monde coffee comes in pre-packaged cans. I've been places that served it, but nothing even comes close to the original. 

My Etouffee usually comes out in a darker brown color. I've never had anything really pink.. maybe with a pink hue, but not really overtly pink. The only place I've ever been to outside of Louisiana that did Cajun food well was this place called Yatz in Indianapolis, and the owners there were from New Orleans. The etouffee I like is usually really bold flavor-wise- heavy on seasonings, and more like a thick sauce than a curry or soup. I've had etouffee that had the consistency of gumbo, and was extremely disappointed.. My best advice? Keep your expectations low for quality of food when you're looking at Cajun outside of Louisiana- I currently live in Michigan, and anything labelled Cajun here usually only has some sort of seasoning akin to Tony's (although not nearly as good).

<TEXT> I'd recommend buying some American DJ PAR24s or PAR56's with gel and just plugging them into static power. Dmx is going to be too much of a hassle if you don't know how to control it and if you don't have a guy to run it for you. Buy some of those pars and do uplights/washes with them. You'll have to buy gel frames and gels but it shouldn't set you back too much. Look for a tech dealer/rental company in your area to determine what gels you want. I'd recommend Rosco or Apollo. 

You could also go LED- Monoprice has LEDs for around 100$ a fixture. I've used them a lot, they're surprisingly good! You could use them as uplights or something but you'd have to set them to standalone mode. LEDs don't have a bulb to burn out or gels to ruin so that might be a better option for you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm kind of a statistics nut- I took two semesters of psychology stats and loved it. I'm currently an undergraduate psychology major. 

I would recommend roughing it out. Sure, your GPA will look better- but colleges want you to take hard classes. The thing I regret most about high school is not challenging myself. I'm not saying you aren't, but by dropping out I think you're underestimating yourself. Statistics is more about logic than math. Get a tutor. Go to a local university and get some help. Google homework problems and do them. Look up YouTube videos and try to understand the overall picture. Don't give up just because it's hard- buckle down and finish it! Don't sell yourself short- if you really tried you could probably pull off a C+ or a B- by the end of the semester. 

Also, what field are you interested in? If it's anything science related, especially psych, you'll need statistics anyway. 

If you'd like any more advice, feel free to pm me.  </TEXT>

This suggests language affects the way people perceive color: http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/13/3/95.short

This is more of a neuroscience based article on brain activation in an MRI while people are looking at colors in their right and left visual fields: http://www.pnas.org/content/106/20/8140.full

<TEXT> Suicide is not the answer. Things WILL get better. 

I was suicidal for a few years. Then, my grandpa killed himself in my driveway. Blew his brain all over the pavement. after going through that.. Enduring that pain, constantly replaying that day in my mind, wishing I could've changed things.. I could never put my loved ones in that situation. 

Life is a bitch. It sucks. There's going to be bad days. But OP, I promise it will get better. It took me a long time to get better.. But now I've found a girl I love and I'm now in a place where I'm happy. It'll happen for you too. 


If you're really suicidal, try /r/offmychest or /r/suicidewatch. There are people out there willing to help. You just have to reach out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Undergrad psych major here. Going to grad school in two years. 

Here's how I look at it: sure, phd is more school, but I don't want to look back 20 years from now and wish I would've done it. I'm a huge advocate of continuing education- PhD programs are worth it simply because a lot of them will give you a masters along the way if you enroll straight from undergrad. In addition to the financial benefits, she'll be much better equipped to be competitive in research as well. Plus she'll be taken more seriously by juries with a phd than a MA in court settings 

The GRE is a glorified ACT. just get some study guides, like the one that has the 500 most commonly used words on the GRE, and study for it. Most psych majors make a 300 on it, and grad schools like 310-320 I believe, so after retaking it a few times she'll be fine

Speaking from experience here, find a grad school that does research she's interested in. I just looked at the Johns Hopkins cog sci department and realized it wasn't for me merely because all of their research is in linguistics and I'm just not interested in that. Chances are once she enrolls in a program she'll be doing the same project for the length of the program, so she needs to find a school with professors that do research she's interested in. Once she does, have her email them and find out more.. Ask for their articles, ask questions.. Eventually when she applies they'll want her because of that interest she has. IMO most of what grad schools look for are 1). Research experience 2). Letters of recommendation. If she has either of those, she'll be able to find a school that fits her 

Sorry for the lengthy post. If you have any questions feel free to PM me or have her PM me </TEXT>

<TEXT> I own a '97 TJ currently so I know a bit about older vehicles. 

From those pics, looks like he babied the hell out of it. Definitely looks promising. Word of advice: drop 100$ or so and get it checked out by a good mechanic just to be sure that he's not trying gyp you. 

As far as owning an older jeep: jeep ownership is amazing. I love the freedom- taking the doors and top off is fantastic in my area during the summer. Also, I love being able to do my own mechanic work. Because there's hardly any electronics, besides the obvious, it's super simple to work on. I just replaced all four of my brake lines in an afternoon. That kind of freedom IMO isn't found too often with newer cars. Mine tends to have problems now and again but all of it is so simple that I don't mind. Plus, I'm in love with mine- might be a bit of a rust bucket but I love the thing. 

Look for rust on the under carriage and frame. Also, pay attention to the age of the wiring under the hood- it'll be a good indicator of whether you'll have issues in the future. Check out all the hoses and lines (brake, fuel, ect) to make sure that they're not too rusted out. Even if they are, I'd still invest in it and try and get the price down due to the rust. Check the differentials, brakes, and engine bay for wetness or moist areas. Might be an indicator of a bad gasket, radiator, hose, ect. start it up first before checking. 

Above all, test drive it. Get a feel for the transmission, how it shifts, how the brakes are (spongy, solid, ect), how acceleration is, any weird noises. Driving it will give you more information than anything else will. 

Owning an older vehicle is definitely a bit different but it's rewarding nonetheless. I wouldn't pass this one up just for it's age- from the pictures and price, if everything checks out, it's a steal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not OP but I'm currently pursuing a bachelors in Psychology with a pre-professional emphasis. I'm involved heavily in research- I'm currently working with my department chair doing a few projects. By the time I graduate in 2016, I'll have at least 2-3 papers published that I'm either sole or coauthor on. I've never had this much fun learning and working before. Research is amazing, as long as you know what you're doing and know your way around statistics and SPSS or R. 

If you have a passion for research, it's great. There's tons of people wanting research done and if you can design a pilot study that has promising results it's fairly easy to find money (at least around here). As far as getting into the field, I've talked to numerous researchers at conferences about this topic. As long as you've got a solid research background and a good degree, the field is hiring a lot. The stuff you hear on reddit is mainly pertaining to a BS in psychology, where it's fairly difficult to get a decent job with only a BS. 

If you're considering going into Masters- do it. This is the one piece of advice I'll always stick by- if you want more education there is no reason you shouldn't pursue it. You don't want to look back, 20 years from now, and wish you would've gone for that degree or that certification.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a guy and I relate to Ted a lot. I'm a romantic, and I've fallen for girls who didn't care about me.. I've seen myself in Ted when he does ridiculous stuff like stealing the blue horn. While I don't think this season is the best, I've invested myself into the show so much that I've got to hold out long enough to see Ted finally find his other half.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had been talking to this amazing girl for about a year. We met at a birthday party of a mutual friend and really hit it off. She and I had attended high school together but never really bonded. 

Following summer she went to brazil(apparently to a clinic there to get help for mental problems, found this out later) and we kept in touch, got really close. She comes back, we get closer, she starts dropping hints like talking about her sex drive in front of me, and telling me that my "voice is so sexy, I need some chocolate or something to calm myself down after hearing you on the phone".  I even asked other girls about it, to make sure that I wasn't reading into it too much, and they said it definitely seemed like flirting to them too. 

So I obviously went for it.. She acts like she has no idea what happened, denies it all. I keep trying and stay friends with her.. She keeps flirting but denying it all. 

One of my best friends gf talks to her and asks wtf is going on, she denies it, then yells at me for "spreading rumors" about us being together. Truly WTF moment right there. 

Anyway, confronted her and told her that she had been flirting whether she realized it or not and that if she didn't want anything, I needed time away to get my shit straight. She then starts telling me how she's battling with suicidal thoughts and mental disorders and how a relationship is the last thing on her mind.. Ends off by saying she hopes I'm not mad. Haven't talked to her in months. Talked to her ex and he said that she went full crazy on him too. 

Come to find out, now my best friend is going after her even though he knows how crazy she is.. Jesus H. Christ.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> John Watson worked at John Hopkins at the time of the experiment. No one ever had records from him because before he died, he burned all of his records and said that "when a person dies, all of them should die." That was weird but no one really knew anything else. 

Anyway, back in 2010, I believe, a group of undergrad students in a class taught by Hall Beck asked him what happened to little Albert- he told them no one knew, but if they wanted, he could help them find out. 

The students did research and found out what happened. 

When Watson was at John Hopkins, there was a wet nurse(nurse who breastfed infants) working there, the mother of little Albert. She had her child out of wedlock and was a wet nurse- she would've had a low social status, enough that Watson easily could've goaded her into letting him experiment on Albert. 

 Turns out his name wasn't Albert. It was Douglas Merritte. (I forget his mothers name) Turns out, Douglas died at the age of 6 from hydrocephalus, caused by meningitis. They suspect that Douglas, early on, had been intentionally infected via spinal taps by researchers. At the time of the experiments by Watson, he was nearly blind and deaf, and had major problems with his learning capabilities. This child must've had a horrible childhood. 

In the original paper by Watson, he says that "they chose the child because he was a completely normal, healthy, happy child." At the end of the paper, he explains that they did not extinguish the conditioning in Douglas because his mother stopped their experiments. Watson basically intended on molesting the boy to extinguish the behaviors. If you don't believe me, look in the paper. It's there. Last paragraph. 

There's one other thing. Watson knew a publisher. He wanted his work published, so he lied about his work being peer reviewed and edited. He did it all himself, without any help from anyone else. This is why peer review is so important today. 

The IRB and ethics boards today were formed to keep this kind of unethical study from ever happening.  It kills me to know that something like this was allowed to happen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Talk with people in the field. Go to your professors, find out about their research. Go to professional conferences. Find out what you're passionate about and whether you're actually into the field or not. 

I was where you are three years ago. I'm in college now as a psychology major and I love it. I'm the happiest I ever have been in school. I went to the Midwestern psychological association meeting in Chicago recently and found out what topics I'm passionate about and those topics have spurred me into research projects that will probably carry me through until I graduate. 

The one thing you need to be certain of is your passion for the field. This is your career- if you're not happy now, you probably won't be later on.  It's a long, tough road but if you have a passion for the work you'll make it. 

I hope I'm not coming off as condescending- if I am, that is not my intention. I just had someone tell me this in the past- I just wanted to do the same thing and I'm hoping it'll help you like it helped me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My uncle got into a bar fight with a couple of guys while drunk. From what he says, a guy was threatening him and beating him pretty badly so he ran to his car to get his gun, there was a scuffle, and the other guy died. He said the other guy had a gun and pulled it, so he shot first. He's in for life without parole in the state pen because they couldn't find the gun he said the other guy had. 

Family reacted badly. For months things were in chaos. 

Still pisses me off that he did that and left his wife and kids on the outside. 

On the upside, he's not an alcoholic anymore. 

Now, it's sad, but we go and see him every chance we get. The prison he's at is really good about visitation. Rest of the family has accepted it as best they can, I suppose. 

We never saw it coming.  </TEXT>

Then I realized that I have had no relationship with a deity of any kind ever. 

I stopped trying. I'm ok with risking going to hell for not going to church. 

I only hope that I'm judged, if I am, based on the merits of my actions rather than church attendance. 

Life is much easier now that I don't have to deal with crazy religious drama.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was friends with this kid, lets call him Dave. 

Dave and I were fairly close in 4th grade, along with a few other guys. He had a rough home life, moved off for a few years. 

Fast forward to 8th grade- he's back, and doesn't care that I was his friend back in the day. He made it his personal mission to torment me by pushing me down, spitting in my face, and swearing at me nearly every day. He had changed completely, it was like he was another person. 

My dad, a homicide cop with the county, came in and intervened after a few weeks, against my will. Dave never messed with me again. 

Few months later, news report comes on about Dave and his tragic death- he had been  cleaning a gun when it fired, hitting him in the head and killing him instantly. Everyone thinks it was a cover up of a suicide. 

Always felt bad for Dave. He just had a shitty family and got dealt a bad hand.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, OP. I know what you're going through. I'm a guy. Had a girl lead me on for an upwards of two years. We were great friends, she was older, and didn't want anything. However, she dropped hints all the time that kept me around.. Right when I thought I'd be able to move on, she had me hooked again. 

All of my friends would tell me to leave her be, because there were better girls out there. I didn't want anyone else though. I did everything I could to win her- she had this kind of "come and get me attitude". I don't know why I stayed so long.. 

I would lay awake at night, wondering why she did this to me.. I don't even believe in God, and yet, I still prayed. I was more depressed than I had ever been. 

I realized one day that I wanted to be happy, but couldn't with her in my life. So I deleted her number, deleted her off of Facebook, completely had no contact with her for months. 

For the first time in a long time, I can say I'm happy. We talk from time to time, but I realized that it was all a game to her- I was her toy, and she had no intention of ever being with me. 

What I'm trying to say here, OP, is that you need to cut yourself off- it'll be the only thing that helps. It'll be tough, but you'll make it through just like I did.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> These tend to come out of your ears easier because they're listening headphones rather than actual sport earbuds- I have a job outside where I do a lot of walking and lifting and they occasionally come out but if you don't mind that, they're fine. You literally won't be able to hear anything outside if you have music playing so be careful if you're in an urban area. As far as the cord making sound, it does some, but it's not really noticeable if you're playing something.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Definitely. The sound isolation is fantastic- they make a seal with your ear, and, in my opinion, rival Bose on noise reduction. 

Fairly good on lows, great on mids and highs. 

The X10's rival any IEM or over the ear in sound quality- you'd have to go audiophile, and spend around 1000$ or more to get better. 

For the price, they're definitely the best you'll get without having to spend outrageous money. 

If you end up getting them, let me know what you think.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My grandfather committed suicide a few years ago. I didn't show any emotion for months. It hit me eventually- really hard. I'm still trying to get over it. The pain is as real as it was the day he did it. 

All I can tell you is to be happy he's still here. Everyone has their own way of coping and grieving. You will too, eventually. Suicide is one of the worst emotional traumas someone can go through IMO. 

The most important thing is to treat him like he's your brother- let him know how much you love and appreciate him. It'll be a long road from here, but if he knows that he has support it'll make his life a lot better and give him some hope. 

Trust me. I've been there.  </TEXT>

The problem here is that you're trying to prove that these games reduce pro social behaviors in regular players. Is 20 minutes, and one session, really reliable? 

To do this better, you really need to do multiple sessions for extended amounts of time. In my mind, all they've proven with this is that violent media doesn't have an immediate effect on prosocial behavior.  </TEXT>

Look, if you want a bike, no one is going to stop you. You just have to be prepared to get hurt, break bones, get bruises, and put your life in the hands of other drivers. You can be the best motorcycle driver on the planet, but all it takes is someone running a red light or not seeing you to hurt or kill you. You just have to ask yourself if you're willing to take that risk. A lot of people drive them for years and never have anything happen. But a lot of people aren't that lucky.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was around Christmas last year. It was around midnight. A buddy and I were in the city doing a night photoshoot when a homeless man came up. I usually ignore people like that because they reek of alcohol and I'm not going to give money to someone so they can get wasted. Anyway, he started talking to us and, with tears in his eyes, explained that he had just lost his job and had been living on the streets, and hadn't eaten for days. He had a McDonald's buy-one -get-one coupon and asked if we could help him out. I took him to a restaurant nearby and intended on buying him a hot drink and a meal, only to have the staff there give him one for free. We talked, and come to find out, he was from Louisiana, and had moved up north after Katrina to find a better life, since he had lost everything there. When we were done, I wished him a Merry Christmas, and left.  I often think about him, and how he's doing. He was one of the most genuine people I've ever met. People like that deserve better.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wrote a paper on this song. 

Here's my opinion:

On one side, they're taking liberties by essentially saying they are representative of each side of the argument and "forgiving" each other for their actions and by representing their ancestors.  

On the other, it starts an important conversation between the two sides of the argument. Most southerners(I fall into this category) use terms like redneck and rebel(evidenced by country music songs) and rally behind the rebel flag without intending to portray the original meaning. These things have taken a new meaning- they don't represent racism to the people who use them, they represent pride in their upbringing and their heritage. 

Even though the song, musically and lyrically, sucks ass, I think Paisley and LL Cool J did what they intended by starting conversation about the topic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 
Suicide is a terrible ordeal to have to live through- my grandfather committed suicide two years ago and still hurts as much today as it did then. I have a passion to help people like this, just because I have been through it before with others. 

What people contemplating suicide can't imagine is the sheer force it has on the surviving family members. It's a terrible mental process- something I would never wish on anyone else. 

Sorry to hear about your friend. Were you two close OP? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have had an on/off relationship with a girl for about five years. 

In the beginning, she was really fucked up. She had been raped, she was on meth, and was suicidal. After a few months, I talked her into getting help and she got better. A lot better. She was in and out of relationships and would crash every time one would end, and I would be there for her. 

I was there for her when her friend got killed in a wreck. I was there when she was struggling with addiction. I was there when she was suicidal and depressed- sometimes I'd get calls at 3 am and would spend all night talking to her.  I gave her all I had in order to try and help her. Seemed to work. 

Recently, about a year ago, she told me she had shot up again. You have to understand, I knew this girl like no one else had. I had helped her through things you can't even imagine. I had been so invested that I myself had become depressed, to the point of being suicidal and apathetic because of what I saw and went through with her. Never abandoned her, even at the low points like that. It had been five years.

When she told me she took meth again, I snapped. Told her I couldn't handle that again, and that she needed to go to rehab and that I wasn't going to talk to her until she was clean again. She begged me not to go, played every card she could. Didn't care.  She got clean because of that, and is in college and doing well. I'd do it again in a split second. 

TL;DR- helped a girl get off of drugs by looking out for myself  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's a list of MUST try foods and restaurants. As a Louisiana native, I go to all of these places when I visit. 

Caf Du Monde- Caf Au Lait and beignets. 

Mother's Restaurant- Roast Beef Po-Boy with Debris or the fried shrimp Po-Boy. 

Middendorf's- little ways out of Nola but well worth it. The catfish is legendary, and so is the shrimp Po-Boy. 

VooDoo Barbecue- amazing barbecue. The brisket is great and so is the Cajun sausage there.

<TEXT> I got called a few months ago by my buddy. Apparently his muffler on his 198(ish) MR2 had fallen off. Long story short, we used a clothes hanger to keep the damn thing on.

Another time, same guy, was having engine problems and couldn't start up. So we grabbed some plywood from the back of my truck, put it in between my grille guard and his back bumper(he had a RX8 at the time) and I pushed him so he could pop the clutch and get going. Dented the fuck out of that bumper, but oh well. Car was a piece of shit anyway.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd like the following:

Some sort of upgrade so I can run/jump. Preferably, I'd like to be able to jump on to  various rooftops from ground level. 

A jet pack/flight suit mod so I can just fly wherever the fuck I want. 

Super strength so I can move the cars of asshole drivers who park like shit and ruin it for people looking for a spot. Of course, if I had the previous modification I wouldn't need a car, but I'd still do it out of spite. 

A HUD for my eyes. So I can be redditing during class and for watching porn at home. No one would be the wiser. 

The equivalent of a utility knife in my fingers, but better. Say you need to weld something right quick, you think, and bam, there's a MOTHER FUCKING WELDER COMING OUT OF YOUR FINGER. Say you need to open a package- bam, there's a knife coming OUT OF YOUR HAND. It would be awesome. 

Finally, upgrade to my brain so my cognitive abilities could rival a computer. Studying is a drag. It'd be nice to be able to know everything about everything ever.  </TEXT>

Other than level of excitement, not really. Had some good conversation. She's going back home for the summer and we hinted at the idea of meeting up. 

We really seemed to click. I really liked her, and I'm hoping it was a date. I paid, she seemed resistant but I insisted and paid anyway.

I really want to tell my parents and friends, but most of them are hardcore.. You know how it is. I have a hard time even acting Adventist at this point, pretty much go along with the wishes for a "happy sabbath" and numerous prayer periods in classes.. During the Chapels and Vespers I'm either working doing sound at PMC or on my phone just to get credit.. I'm not entirely against religion at this point, but I do oppose the Adventists for a number of reasons. I'm just afraid that if I do leave, I'll lose my job and the next few years here won't be pretty. Any advice? </TEXT>

Had a girl at a Krispy Kreme flirt with me like she wanted me right there. Went back and asked her out and she turned me down because she had a boyfriend of "almost three years". 

After that I pretty much flirt with girls everywhere hoping one day I can get one drunk enough to agree to go out with me. 

I'm 20 and I've never even been on a date. Pretty pitiful state of affairs.

<TEXT> Sorry I didn't clarify. 

We sold the diesel because we were paying 200/mo for fuel and 500/mo for the note. 

We have a 32ft camper that we used to haul but we rent out a campsite for it year round now so the diesel outlived its practicality. 

Looking for something around $6k, that won't be too bad on fuel, but can still haul stuff around. I do a lot of tech work so I move heavy equipment a lot. 

I was thinking about an older (as in 1995-2004 ) silverado or dodge ram.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's what you'll be causing those who love you. 

I had to endure the suicide of a close family member two years ago. It was easily the most  difficult thing I've ever had to endure. Up until that point, I had contemplated suicide myself. After having someone else close to me do it first, I'm happy I never did. 

When a loved one commits suicide, a couple of things happen. 

First, the immediate shock sent me into a blind rage. My grandfather had shot himself in front of my grandmother, fifteen minutes after I had driven home from school to bring them both lunch. She begged him not to do it. He responded by blowing his brains across the room. 

After the shock subsided, pain set in. Not your average pain. This was different. I walked into the room where he did it and still, to this day, I feel a physical pain in my gut thinking about it. You wonder what you could have done to prevent it.. You ask questions, like why he did it, why didn't he explain, why didn't he let us know he was in pain, and, what now? The pain I endured after his suicide has lasted until today. He died two years ago and the pain is as real as it was then. I don't ever think it will go away. Those questions still persist and probably will still be there until I die. 

Then, during this intense psychological pain, the loved ones have to pick themselves up and pack away your things. This is perhaps the most painful part. The memories were too much for me to handle. It took me about a year to be able to look at his stuff again. Took me a year to visit his grave. 

After this, the family has to go through the funeral. This is another bad part. People send flowers, cards, food- it's all nice, but it doesn't help in the slightest. You put on a good face, tell everyone it's okay, and pretend like the pain is gone when it is really gnawing your soul into oblivion. 

For me, it took a solid year for me to cry about it, and to visit his grave. I look at pictures and still burst into tears, even though its been so long. He was my hero. Perhaps the most knowledgable, most loving and kindhearted man I will ever meet. He will never see my future wife or kids, meet his grandchildren, be able to see me graduate from college.. All because of his decision. I wonder if he would be proud of the path I am taking.. But most of all, I wonder why he killed himself when he was surrounded by people who loved him. 

I don't know you, and I don't know what you're going through. But please, do not commit suicide. You have people who love you. Not only that, but the pain you will cause others is a kind of pain that I have dealt with. It is the most painful experience someone could endure- the worst part is that the pain never leaves. The pain suicide causes is always fresh and ready to bear itself at a whim. 

Life has so much potential. You were put here for a reason. Find that reason and live it. Overcome your problems and show life that you're tougher than what it can throw at you.

<TEXT> Season 8 of 24. 

Spoiler Alert: When Renee gets killed, I was devastated. Jack had been after her for so long, and I was hoping that he would finally get her, but in the end, he never does. 

How I Met Your Mother- Pretty much all of the earlier seasons. Hilarious but somehow still somber- I could relate to Ted and his search for love so much. Later seasons haven't been as good but I'm happy with how things are turning out. 

Seinfeld- the Soup Nazi or the Butter Shave. 

Frasier- the entire series was fantastic. The series finale hit me hard.  </TEXT>

I've come close to being in relationships.. Seems like I always get the girls who tease but don't want any semblance of a relationship. Oh well. Bitches will be bitches. I'm willing to wait around for a nice girl who isn't going to cause me heartache and needless drama. I might be naive for believing there's such a thing as soul mates- but I do, and until I find mine, I'm willing to wait. 

I'm not too worried about it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Couldn't post so had to reply.. Sorry about that. 

Lost my grandfather to suicide two years ago. 

Lost my mentor of over ten years to cancer six months ago. 

Lost my uncle to cancer six months ago. 

Haven't told anyone this, but these are slowly eating away at me. I regret things I could've said or done. Every day and every night. It's like a living hell sometimes. Even though its been so long, the pain is like new every day. 

Not to mention, I'm a borderline atheist who comes from a family of staunch, bible thumping Christians called Seventh-Day Adventists. 

Can't tell anyone about any of this.. Mainly because I'm too proud. Glad I have Reddit though. Even if this gets buried in the deepest corners of Reddit, it feels good to talk about it.

<TEXT> 20 year old virgin here too. 

Dude, don't do it. My grandfather killed himself two years ago. It is hands down the most painful thing I've ever had to go through. I run through the day he killed himself every day in my mind. Had I shown up earlier, I could've stopped him. Had I said something to him, been better to him, maybe it would've changed things.. It hurts so much, even now.  Two years later and it still hurts like it was yesterday. I was suicidal before his suicide- when I realized how much pain it could cause others, particularly my family. In retrospect, I'm glad I didn't. 

I was wrapped around this girls finger once. Slightest hint and I'd be enthralled. She led me on for years. Four to be exact. She destroyed me. That is the lowest I've ever been or ever will go. I finally realized, amidst the heavy rock music and depression, that I was worth more than that. 

Ever since, I've gained confidence in who I am and that slutty, controlling bitch can go fuck herself for all I care. I won't ever let that happen again. 


Long story short, women aren't everything. When you're meant to find a woman, you will buddy. Just gotta wait. Being single is better- no drama, no bullshit, nothing to worry about.  Plus, if you're wrapped around some woman's finger you might miss the one you're meant to find. 

 I know how it is. I've been there.  But you have to remember that there are people who love you and who wouldn't know what to do without you. Suicide is not the answer. If you get close again, make sure to talk to your friends about it. Let them know. See your doctor. You can get out of this. I did. I'm glad I let people in so I could.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Where do I start...
Smoking, have tattoos, incessantly swear, flirt with other guys.

Other things that piss me off: 
Slang. Be classy. Show that you're going to college by speaking/texting intelligently and classily. Don't try to be "cool" and swear all the time and degrade other racial ethnicities/minorities. That's no bueno. 

A side note: have an opinion. Don't be one of those girls who will agree to whatever the guy suggests. Sometimes, we want to do what you like. You incessantly saying "whatever you want/like" isn't helping our cause and is really annoying. 

Also have an opinion on things like politics, religion, world issues. Even if you disagree with the guy, I personally like a girl who has an opinion different than mine and can back it up. Ignorance of these things isn't helping you any. 

Clothing wise, I hate skateboarding shoes/outfits. Also, hipster outfits. You're not impressing anyone. Big hoop earrings are fucking weird. Don't do it. 

Dress to impress. Sweats and no makeup is okay sometimes, but if you're trying to impress a guy, looking like you just rolled out of bed doesn't help your game any. I'm sure you ladies would appreciate a guy dressing nice to impress you- we appreciate the same. 

Oh, and for God's sake, don't freak out if a guy doesn't text back immediately. I've been with women before who incessantly text you, which is nice sometimes, but when you're at work/in class/at home beating the buffalo, it can get tedious. Have enough confidence to wait. Some guys aren't big into texting in the first place.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Imagine you're in a sinkhole. There is no light, no visible way out, and darkness is closing in. That's what depression is like. 

I've struggled with it most of my life. Past few years have been happy though. 

My grandfather committed suicide a year ago. 

My mentor died of cancer two months ago. 

I have never contemplated suicide because of what my grandfather put me through. Needless to say, it is not something you can snap out of. It is a disease, and only a doctor can help. People's view of depression could not be more skewed. I'm happy I'm done with it. 

I live every day in constant battle with my depression. The threat of relapse hangs over my head daily. It is a daily struggle, one that I could not get through without my family and friends.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually used to have this nice-guy-itis and didn't know how to get rid of it. So my sophomore year of high school, I made up a creative way of asking this girl I liked to prom. I went to a Chinese restaurant and got a fortune cookie, heated it up, opened it, and left a note inside asking her to prom and letting her know who it was from. Resealed the package and paid off the office staff to put it in her locker for me. She turned me down, but it was a big boost to my self confidence. Do something risky and step out of your comfort zone. It helps a lot. Once you're out of your zone, you get used to being outside of it and that sets you up so you can start being more confident. 

    Number one rule- don't constantly text a girl. Chances are, if she doesn't text you first she probably isn't into you and constantly texting doesn't help. Also, let conversations breathe. If she doesn't respond right away, just wait. Apologizing for bothering her screams insecurity. 

TL;DR- asked a girl out and got self confidence.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off, stay away from Chauvet. They're notorious for breaking and not lasting long. A fairly cheap solution would be to get Luminair for iOS and hook your lights up via art net to Ethernet so you can control your lights via iOS. Luminair is incredibly easy to use. Try out controlbooth.com for a forum on lighting and sound. Those guys are awesome. I've been doing lighting for a while but I don't know a simple controller for that cheap. Maybe the guys at CB will have a suggestion. Best of luck.  </TEXT>
