<TEXT> How limited will Yates be?
Democrats have pinned a lot of hopes on Yates, privately promising blockbuster testimony from the former Obama administration official. But a key question is how much she will be limited in public, either through questions regarding classified material, promises of attorney-client privilege or claims of executive privilege from either Trump or Obama.
Yates' first public hearing was scheduled for six weeks ago, but it was canceled at the last minute by Trump ally and House intelligence committee Chairman Devin Nunes. Reports later emerged that the White House blocked her testimony, which press secretary Spicer vehemently denied.
Monday's hearing comes a week after FBI Director James Comey spoke to the full Judiciary Committee as well as House investigators. Comey, too, was limited in what he could say, citing an active investigation. As senators tried to pry any bit of information out of him, Comey beat back questions about the continuing federal probe into Russian interference in the US elections, and he likewise revealed few new details to the House intelligence committee. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. What was the extent of Yates' warning?
Yates told White House staff and other top officials that Flynn could be a security risk after he discussed Russia sanctions with Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak, CNN reported last week. That testimony is expected to contradict the White House's description of her warning, framed by press secretary Sean Spicer as "a 'heads-up' to us on some comments that may have seemed in conflict with what he (Flynn) had sent the vice president."
Trump on Twitter Monday blamed the Obama administration for giving Flynn, who briefly led the Defense Intelligence Agency during the 44th president's tenure, "the highest security clearance." </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is surprisingly difficult to estimate levels of voter turnout by race. Unlike the forthcoming report from the Current Population Survey, Catalists estimates are based not on self reports but on actual turnout records. Since most states do not ask voters about their racial/ethnic background, Catalist usually estimates this information from the voters name and neighborhood.

According to recent research, Catalist correctly predicts race/ethnicity about 91 percent of the time. Further, we use Catalists estimates of voter race for both 2012 and 2016. If Catalists estimates are wrong, theyre likely wrong in a consistent way  and so any differences we find in the electorates racial composition are accurate.

The denominator we use to calculate turnout rates is an estimate of the citizen voting-age population (CVAP) by race in November 2012 and November 2016, respectively. To construct this estimate, we use the Census Bureaus Population Estimates Program data to calculate the voting-age population in each state by race, and then use American Communities Survey information on citizenship rates to remove the (often substantial) noncitizen population for each racial/ethnic group. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The House narrowly passed legislation, known as the American Health Care Act,  in a 217-213 vote, fulfilling a years-long campaign pledge and sending the bill to the Senate.

Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of GOP leadership, also signaled that Republicans are focused on getting a deal that can pass rather than sticking to a specific timeline.
I cant imagine there will be a rush to take up the bill as much as a real concentrated effort to find where the 51 votes might be if the 51 votes are still available, he told reporters.  

The House GOP bill is expected to have to undergo significant changes in the upper chamber to meet budgetary rules that would allow it to block a Democratic filibuster. </TEXT>

For example, saying that you will lose your internet access. Thats simply absurd, Pai told Recodes Decode podcast on Wednesday.

"Anyone who had internet access before these rules in 2015 knows that thats not the case. We werent living in a dystopia before the FCC delivered these Depression-era rules to save us, he added.
In the interview, Pai defended his plan to end net neutrality, arguing it would help foster competition in the telecommunications industry by making it easier for smaller broadband providers to grow and gain market share. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Comey has become an almost equally divisive figure for Republicans and Democrats for his impact on the 2016 elections. His revelation that the FBI was examining additional emails from Hillary Clinton that were discovered on disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner's computer, has led Democrats -- including Clinton herself -- to say it cost them the White House.
"I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off," the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee said Tuesday in an interview conducted by CNN's Christiane Amanpour at the Women for Women International summit in New York.
Senate Democrats say the plan to grill the FBI chief about his decision and his timing.
"The most important investigation the FBI is currently conducting is into Russia's interference in our last presidential election," Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat on the Senate judiciary committee, told CNN Tuesday. "This isn't just about understanding Russian interference and potential coordination of some kind with the Trump campaign. This is about defending our next election as well."
But Comey's public announcement during the March House Intelligence Committee hearing that the FBI has been investigating possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives since last July sparked the anger of Trump and his allies.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat on the judiciary committee, said he and others also plan to grill Comey on why he announced that the FBI was looking again at Clinton's emails -- just days before the election.
"The American people really deserve answers about why he did release his comments and letter, and I think he may want to be more forthcoming and he may want to use this forum as an opportunity to tell the American people his side of the story."
Meanwhile, Sen. Lindsey Graham, who is leading his own investigation into Russia's interference in the election, said he still wants Comey to answer whether the FBI issued any warrants against the Trump campaign -- a question he asked months ago. </TEXT>

<TEXT> FBI Director James Comey will testify today on Capitol Hill in a Senate oversight committee hearing on what the FBI knows about a 2015 terrorist attack in Garland, Texas. However, the hearing is expected to turn to the topic of Russia's involvement in the 2016 election and Hillary Clinton.

Comey has become an almost equally divisive figure for Republicans and Democrats for his impact on the 2016 elections
Clinton yesterday blamed Comey's letter on Oct. 28 about her emails for her loss in the 2016 election, saying "If the election had been on Oct. 27, I would be your president."
Senate Democrats say the plan to grill the FBI chief about his decision and his timing of that letter.
GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham said he still wants Comey to answer whether the FBI issued any warrants against the Trump campaign.
And don't forget: Last time Comey was on the stand, he revealed big news. </TEXT>

Haber added, "After reviewing the video, I dont believe that [the shooting] met our core values."

In an updated press release this evening, police clarified that the vehicle was initially backing down the street, "and despite multiple verbal commands from the officer, the vehicle continued to reverse, backing into the main roadway."

The press release continued: "The vehicle then pulled forward as the officer continued to approach the vehicle giving verbal commands. The vehicle continued on the main roadway driving away from the officer." </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the video, an unmasked young militant warns that the Hisba will punish dissenters according to its interpretation of Islam. Enforcers are shown hitting one man with plastic tubing and beheading two elderly adherents of Sufi Islam, accusing them of sorcery and apostasy. Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the video, which has since been removed from the internet.

Egypts military spokesman declined to comment on the incidents in North Sinai, the thinly populated but strategic peninsula between the Suez Canal, Israel and Gaza where a legacy of government neglect has created fertile ground for radicalisation among disenfranchised locals. A security source downplayed concerns that the militants were capable of spreading the kind of sectarian violence that has torn apart Iraq.

They are trying to have an impact, and we are not saying we have completely eradicated them, but they are weak, he said. </TEXT>

It remains unclear whether the document replaces or changes in any way Hamas's 1988 charter, which calls for Israels destruction and is the Islamist group's covenant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has criticized President Hassan Rouhani for saying his detente policy with the West had caused the threat of war to fade as tensions intensify in Tehran before May election.

Rouhani, a pragmatist whose election in 2013 led to a diplomatic thaw between Iran and the West, championed in 2015 a landmark deal in which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear activities in return for lifting of international sanctions.

A standoff between Rouhani, who is seeking a second term, and Khamenei's allies, who opposed the nuclear deal, has intensified in recent months ahead of the May 19 vote.

"Some say since we took office the shadow of war has been faded away. This is not correct," Khamenei was quoted as saying by the state media on Sunday. </TEXT>

Tom Perriello says this isnt a real job, read the sign, which bore a photo of a man working on a pipeline. Northam has not come out against the pipelines  which McAuliffe backs as a big source of jobs  but says they must be subjected to strict environmental review.

Asked who he supports in the GOPs three-way primary, Gaines drew a blank. I dont even know whos in it to tell you the truth, he said. On the Republican side, Gillespie, Prince William County Supervisors Chairman Corey Stewart and state Sen. Frank Wagner (Virginia Beach) are vying for their partys nomination.

Democrats in Congress have not hesitated to attack the administration for what many have deemed a blatant disregard for climate science and environmental regulations aimed at stemming the effects of global warming and climate change.

But the rally on Saturday, marked by potentially record-setting high temperatures in the nation's capital, offered Democrats an opportunity once again to take aim at President Trump. 

"It shows you that we have a mobilized and organized effort to push back and fight President Trump's really hardline, extremist agenda," Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) said on CNN.


The march came a day after the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it would pull the plug on its websites containing information on climate change, in order to "reflect the views of the leadership of the agency."

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has voiced skepticism that human activity has caused shifts in the earth's climate, despite arguments to the contrary by an overwhelming majority of climate scientists.

Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) on Saturday denounced the EPA's decision to remove the climate change sites, calling it "a slap in the face to the world."

<TEXT> The motivation for the current climate march is clear: The young Trump administration already has moved to roll back former president Barack Obamas signature climate initiative, the Clean Power Plan, and Trump and his team have taken many other actions to weaken environmental protections of air and water, and to enable fossil fuel exploitation on public lands and waters.

The administration is grappling with a major climate policy decision: whether to remain in the Paris climate agreement. Several of Trumps Cabinet picks are advising against following through on his campaign pledge to cancel the accord. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many of the signs at Saturdays climate march were dark and ominous, warning of climate catastrophe, dying oceans, crop destruction and planet degradation. But the mood of the marchers was anything but somber. Tens of thousands gathered all morning in the lush green National Mall in front of the US Capitol carrying signs, singing and chanting as they prepared to march to the White House. It was a racially diverse crowd with marchers of all ages.

The marchers came prepared with water bottles, hats and sun screen. They also arrived with sunny dispositions. Its beautiful, said Allison Dale, a geologist from Conshohocken, Pa. its so well organized and everyone is really friendly and in a really good mood. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The government of Turkey is blocking access to Wikipedia under a law that allows it to restrict access to material that is considered to be a threat to national security.

"After technical analysis and legal consideration ... an administrative measure has been taken for this website (Wikipedia.Org)," a telecom watchdog said in a statement, according to Reuters.


Turkish law allows authorities to ban entire websites if the content is deemed obscene or poses a threat to national security or the well-being of the public. </TEXT>

Although Macron held his ground during Wednesday showdown over Whirlpool and the tension eventually eased, television channels repeatedly broadcast footage of the candidate being heckled, marking a stark contrast with coverage of Le Pen posing for photographs with workers.

She said in a statement on Wednesday evening that, if elected, she would not let the factory be shut down as planned in 2018 and she would bring it under state control for a time if necessary to secure its future.

"Marine Le Pen has said that, if need be, she could temporarily nationalize the factory to save the plant," the candidate's niece, Marion Marechal-Le Pen, also a National Front member and member of France's parliament, told RTL radio. </TEXT>

<TEXT> PARIS French intelligence has concluded that forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad carried out a sarin nerve gas attack on April 4 in northern Syria and that Assad or members of his inner circle ordered the strike, a declassified report showed.
Assad has said in two media interviews since April 4 that the evidence of a poison gas attack was false and denied his government had ever used chemical weapons.
It said the findings matched the results of samples obtained by French intelligence, including an unexploded grenade, from an attack in Saraqib on April 29, 2013, which Western powers have accused the Assad government of carrying out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ubers Jeff Holden said that these kinds of flying taxis represent the pinnacle of urban mobility  the reduction of congestion and pollution from transportation, giving people their time back, freeing up real estate dedicated to parking and providing access to mobility in all corners of a city.

Those are just the two most recent examples of a dramatic transformation in how we move ourselves and our stuff around. Were also seeing rapid progress on delivery drones, self-driving trucks, supersonic airplanes, and even rockets. In all, there are major transportation breakthroughs being developed today. Almost all of these technologies already have working prototypes. And all of them have well-funded companies aiming to bring them to market by the early 2020s.

Not only will these transportation revolutions make our lives safer and more convenient, they could also change how people feel about the economy and technological progress more generally. Seeing cars drive themselves and drones and flying cars zip over their heads could give people a palpable sense of progress  one thats been missing in recent decades </TEXT>

<TEXT> "You cannot thicken this border without hurting people on both sides of it," Trudeau said. "Any two countries are going to have issues that will be irritants to the relationship. Having a good constructive working relationship allows us to work through those irritants.

Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr echoed Trudeau's sentiment, saying that the tariff hurts people in both countries, including American homebuyers, who will now pay more for wood.

The U.S. and Canada typically enjoy a friendly trading relationship, but things have soured in recent months.

Trump has been railing against Canada's decision to change its policy on pricing domestic milk to cover more dairy ingredients, leading to lower prices for products, including ultra-filtered milk. Trump has called the move "a disgrace" that hurts U.S. producers in dairy states like Wisconsin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> France voted on Sunday in the first round of a bitterly fought presidential election that could define the future of the European Union, and is sure to be seen as a gauge of the anti-establishment anger that has brought upsets in Western politics.

Over 50,000 police and 7,000 soldiers backed by rapid response units patrolled streets three days after a suspected Islamist gunman shot dead a policeman and wounded two others in the heart of the capital, Paris.

Voters will decide whether to back a pro-EU centrist newcomer, a scandal-ridden veteran conservative who wants to slash public expenditure, a far-left eurosceptic admirer of Fidel Castro, or a far-right nationalist who, as France's first woman president, would shut borders and ditch the euro.

The outcome will show whether the populist tide that saw Britain vote to leave the EU and Donald Trump elected president of the United States is still rising, or starting to ebb.

But it also provides a choice between radically different recipes for reviving a listless economy that lags its neighbors, and where almost a quarter of under-25s have no job.

A high level of indecision added to the nervousness.

Hanan Fanidi, a 33-year-old financial project manager, was still unsure as she arrived at a polling station in Paris's 18th arrondissement.

"I don't believe in anyone, actually. I haven't arrived at any candidate in particular who could advance things," she said. "I'm very, very pessimistic."

Despite fears that broad disillusionment with politics could keep voters away, the early turnout, in fair weather nationwide, was marginally up on the last election, in 2012.

Emmanuel Macron, 39, a centrist ex-banker who set up his party just a year ago, is the opinion polls' favorite to win the first round and then beat far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen in the two-person runoff on May 7. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A specter is haunting Republican candidates: The specter of Nancy Pelosi. Six-and-a-half years after the party wiped out the Democrats House majority, the 77-year old Californian has become the only constant in Republican campaign ads. Last week, in Kansas, Democrats fell seven points short of an upset in a House race; this week, in Georgia, Democrats won the first round of a congressional race that they hoped to win outright.

In both cases, Republican voters were woken up with images of Pelosi the way a hero in a B-movie is woken up by a bucket of water being thrown at his face. The National Republican Congressional Committees ads in Kansas tied Democrat James Thompson to Pelosis agenda of higher taxes and Obamacare. The Congressional Leadership Funds ads in Georgia painted Democrat Jon Ossoff as a Pelosi enabler, too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Delvonn Heckard, 46, filed a lawsuit against Murray this month under the pseudonym "D.H."
In the lawsuit, he said the mayor "repeatedly raped" him when he was a 15-year-old boy and the mayor was 32 at the time. Heckard said Murray also paid him for sexual acts.
Heckard's attorney, Lincoln Beauregard, sent a letter to Murray's attorney this week revealing his client's full name. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure, they avoided the calamity of an outright loss in Tuesdays special election in Georgia, advancing to a runoff race in two months to replace the new health secretary, Tom Price. And when lawmakers return next week, House Speaker Paul D. Ryans first order of business will be to swear in the newest House Republican, Ron Estes, after his special election win in Kansas last week.

But both races gave Republicans a scare they never would have anticipated six months ago  and demonstrated that Democrats have galvanized the anti-Trump activism of the past three months into votes at the ballot box. Even though Democrats came up short in each race, these were seats way down the list of top Democratic targets. This was particularly true of the Estes race, in a district where Trump won by an overwhelming margin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One source may be the statistic popularized a few years ago, most prominently by GOP Presidential candidate Mitt Romney, that 47 percent of tax-filing households have no net federal income tax liability. While accurate, this is often misremembered as applying to taxes in general, implying that there is a substantial non-taxpaying class.

In my survey research, I have found that Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to estimate the taxpaying population at around 50 percent. A third of Republicans pick an estimate between 40 and 60 percent, compared to only a fifth of Democrats. On average, Republicans thought about 62 percent of the U.S. adult population pays taxes  but even among Democratic respondents, the average estimate of the taxpaying population was 71 percent of U.S. adults. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Russia arrests two suspected 'terrorist' recruiters
Two suspected recruiters of "terrorists" from Central Asia were arrested in Saint Petersburg, justice authorities said on Saturday, in connection with a deadly bomb attack on the Russian city's metro. One suspect, aged 32, is accused of recruiting for the Islamic State group, while the other, aged 39, faces allegations of being a recruiter for "terrorist organisations in Syria". One of the two is from the Osh region of Kyrgyzstan, an area known for the number of recruits it has provided for Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Fourteen people died and dozens were injured in the April 3 blast which has been blamed on 22-year-old Akbarjon Djalilov, thought to be a Russian national born in Kyrgyzstan, who died in the blast. There has been no claim of responsibility for the attack but investigators say they are probing possible links to Islamic State jihadists. Eight people -- all from mainly Muslim Central Asia -- have been detained in Moscow and Saint Petersburg over alleged involvement in the attack. As of the beginning of April, police in St Petersburg had arrested seven nationals of Central Asian countries on suspicion of being "terrorist" recruiters. (AFP) </TEXT>

Wilson voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act in 2013. </TEXT>

The US and Britain are part of the so-called "Five Eyes" agreement (along with Canada, Australia and New Zealand), which calls for open sharing among member nations of a broad range of intelligence.
The communications are likely to be scrutinized as part of the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russia's efforts to meddle in the 2016 presidential election. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Guardian has been told the FBI and the CIA were slow to appreciate the extensive nature of contacts between Trumps team and Moscow ahead of the US election. This was in part due to US law that prohibits US agencies from examining the private communications of American citizens without warrants. They are trained not to do this, the source stressed.

It looks like the [US] agencies were asleep, the source added. They [the European agencies] were saying: There are contacts going on between people close to Mr Trump and people we believe are Russian intelligence agents. You should be wary of this.

The message was: Watch out. Theres something not right here.

According to one account, GCHQs then head, Robert Hannigan, passed material in summer 2016 to the CIA chief, John Brennan. The matter was deemed so sensitive it was handled at director level. After an initially slow start, Brennan used GCHQ information and intelligence from other partners to launch a major inter-agency investigation.

In late August and September Brennan gave a series of classified briefings to the Gang of Eight, the top-ranking Democratic and Republican leaders in the House and Senate. He told them the agency had evidence the Kremlin might be trying to help Trump to win the presidency, the New York Times reported.

One person familiar with the matter said Brennan did not reveal sources but made reference to the fact that Americas intelligence allies had provided information. Trump subsequently learned of GCHQs role, the person said. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Later, Trump said he asked Stoltenberg to look into collecting back-dues from countries, something that Stoltenberg did not verbally agree to do. Trump has consistently misrepresented the financial obligations of NATO members, saying they owe vast sums in dues and the situation is unfair to the United States. NATO members do not owe dues or back payments.

Trump also thanked NATO members for condemning Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons and the barbaric killing of small and helpless children and babies. At one point, Trump referred to the Syrian leader as a butcher.

On Wednesday, Trump backed away from several other firm positions that he had held for months on the campaign trail. Early in the day, the government ended a federal government hiring freeze that Trump had promised to institute, although departments have been told to find other ways to shrink staff sizes. Then, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, the president announced he no longer considers China a currency manipulator, he now supports lower interest rates and the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and he would consider renominating Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen when her tenure is up next year, despite saying on the campaign trail he would most likely not reappoint her.

Last week, Trump abandoned his longtime stance that the United States should not get involved with Syria when he approved a strike on an airbase there.

I felt we had to do something about it, Trump said Wednesday of the Syria bombing. I have absolutely no doubt we did the right thing. And it was very, very successfully done, as you well know. </TEXT>

How Trump came to love NATO
In another reversal, Trump praised Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, whom he had previously pledged to replace when her term expires, and once accused of holding interest rates low as a political boost for former President Barack Obama.
It was not clear whether Trump's sudden policy flips were the product of a new outlook and worldview. But previous presidents have often remarked that the world looks a lot different from the Oval Office than from a campaign rally. </TEXT>

Lavrov, in turn, gave a similar answer, saying he doesn't want Russian citizens to become victims of cybercrime.

Putin has said that the claims that Russia meddled in US election are "lies." However, the FBI and intelligence committees from both the House and Senate in the US investigate the alleged interference in the US election, including possible ties between Russian officials and members of Trump's campaign team. </TEXT>

Putin has traditionally met with the US Secretary of State on their visits to Moscow. And Tillerson and Putin are no strangers -- Putin in 2013 awarded the Order of Friendship to Tillerson when he was CEO of ExxonMobil, the highest honor Russia gives to foreigners. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "..coordinated with the Russian government to swing the election in Trumps favor." 
The cunning of Trump and the Trumpettes is that the only real evidence that can be held against their campaign is recorded phone conversations, emails   other electronic means. It seems that they knew that conversations are 'mere hearsay'.  
 
Since the FBI was investigating various people, well before Comey revealed a renewed investigation resulting from Weiner's computer, it's rather obvious that that revelation was to allay the rebels in the FBI who wanted Trump. 
It's also obvious that paid Russian regime internet activity, aimed at destroying Clinton, gained a lot of traction because of Comey's political gambit. 
Since Trump is a minority president it's always going to be a wonder by how much more he would have lost the popular vote, and perhaps the electoral college, if there was no paid, Russian government lies and obfuscation. 
It's now a delicate matter of the FBI wanting to deal with this embarrassing situation. I wonder how many discussions people there will be having about how to limit their culpability.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Swedish police have brought in seven people for questioning over an apparent terror attack in which a hijacked delivery truck mowed down pedestrians in Stockholm, killing four people, authorities said on Sunday.

A 39-year-old Uzbek man was arrested earlier as the suspected driver of the truck that rammed into crowds in the Swedish capital on Friday. The man had been known to Swedish security services but had no clear links to militant groups.

A further 15 people were injured when the beer delivery truck barrelled down a busy shopping street before crashing into a department store and catching fire.

"Seven people have been brought in for questioning as a result of these events," Jonas Hysing, national head of police operations, told public broadcaster SVT, after several raids on addresses around Stockholm over the weekend.

Hysing declined to give further information about the raids, but said "the evidence looks very strong" that the Uzbek man was the driver of the hijacked truck.

Vehicles have also been used as weapons in Nice and Berlin in the past year in attacks claimed by Islamic State militants.

Stockholm was returning to normality on a bright Sunday morning with police barricades taken down along the Drottninggatan street where the attack took place.

Hundreds of flower bouquets covered steps leading down to the square next to where the truck ploughed into the Ahlens department store, with more piled up under boarded-up windows. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Norwegian police set off a controlled explosion of a "bomb-like device" in central Oslo early on Sunday and were holding a suspect in custody in an investigation led by security police.

A Reuters reporter described a loud bang shortly after Oslo's bomb squad arrived with a remote-controlled robot once the area was cordoned off by police late on Saturday night.

"The noise from the blast was louder than our explosives themselves would cause," a police spokesman said, adding that further investigation was needed to find out if the device had contained explosives.

The device, about 30 cm (1 ft) across, had appeared to be capable of causing only a limited amount of damage. Forensics experts will examine fragments to figure out what it was. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No one from the administration has yet articulated what they want the end game to be. Just last week, Tillerson said the Syrian people would decide the fate of Assad. U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said removing Assad from power was no longer a priority. White House press secretary Sean Spicer earlier this week defended that position by saying its necessary to accept the political reality on the ground.  
 
At his briefing last night (after the attack), Tillerson confusingly warned against reading too much into the bombings. This clearly indicates the president is willing to take decisive action when called for, the secretary said. I would not in any way attempt to extrapolate that to a change in our policy or posture relative to our military activities in Syria today. There has been no change in that status. What exactly does he mean by that? Is it still not a U.S. priority to take out Assad? Spicer cut off questioning before anyone could follow up.  
 
Nothing has changed! 
 
There is no follow up policy! </TEXT>

House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called on the House to return from its two-week break in order to debate whether to authorize military action against Syria.

The Presidents action and any response demands that we immediately do our duty. Congress must live up to its Constitutional responsibility to debate an Authorization of the Use of Military Force against a sovereign nation, Pelosi wrote in a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan, Friday, just 12 hours after US forces launched a missile strike on a Syrian airbase.

"Rather than meet violence with violence in an ever-escalating descent into chaos, the U.S. will respond to the chemical attack on Syrian civilians by immediately inviting the refugees already vetted into our country and making preparations to increase the number of refugees we admit tenfold. We also will make a major increase in our support of humanitarian work within Syria and Turkey and Jordan to support the hundreds of thousands of innocent people who have been displaced by this senseless civil war. This is how a 'great' nation stands with the victims of an illegal attack by an illegitimate regime on the citizens of its own country."

<TEXT> Dog and pony show. This is just a coordinated distraction. Everybody knew. The Russian were notified. Syria knew well in advance the strike was coming (wonder how they knew) and they removed all sensitive and vital information plus people. Pointless waste of money and all it will do is escalate the situation.  
 
Now it should be pointed out that this illegal airstrike was not authorized by congress and republicans AGAIN are giving cover to Duh Con. When President Obama "REQUESTED AUTHORIZATION" to do this the REPUBLICAN Congress of "NO" said, NO. Why? Because they are WPOS! Now those same morons say this: 
-Trump: The President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syria-big mistake if he does not! Duh Con didn't get approval.  
-Paul Ryan: gave Trump approval for Thursday nights airstrikes, in 2013 he said that Obamas proposed military strike cannot achieve its stated objectives and could make things worse. 
-Marco Rubio: Rubio has been blanketing the airwaves praising Trumps airstrikes, in 2013 he said that I have long argued forcefully for engagement in empowering the Syrian people, I have never supported the use of U.S. military force in the conflict. 
-Jason Chaffetz: sent out a tweet that read, God bless the USA! But in 2013, he said he would oppose the use of force in Syria on the grounds that he saw no clear and present danger to the United States that would justify using force. 
 
However it's jake with Duh Con. Anything to help distract from Trump/Russia Gate.

<TEXT> Before further unilateral military action from Trump, we have to know: Did Trump just happen to risk war or terrorist attacks against the US in order to create a yuge distraction from the news that Sunny Boy Jared did not disclose on his national security clearance form his multiple meetings with Russians during the transition, before being cleared for access to top-secret info on foreign countries? Jared's lawyer now says not reporting these multiple meetings were an "oversight" - this so Jared is not declared a felon and end up where his daddy is. Is this timing really just a coincidence, or did the master showman figure that the best way to cover Jared's lies was to make a big show of attacking the friend of his friend Putin? Remember, Russia was informed of the attack before it occurred. I can just hear the conversation--Trump will attack Syria (whose refugees Trump won't allow into the US), but not destroy Assad's chemical weapons, as a show that he can stand up to Bully Assad and Bully Putin, as a cover to prove that he and his favored son-in-law are not really in bed with the Russians. </TEXT>

However, autopsies conducted by Turkish doctors on Thursday have confirmed that chemical weapons were used in the attack. The autopsies were conducted under the supervision of the World Health Organization. Doctors Without Borders have said that the victims showed symptoms that were consistent with exposure to a nerve agent.

<TEXT> From the mouth of Rachel Maddow over at DNCTV after Reid nuked the Senate in 2013 
 
Wonder how she will "report" the events of today??? 
 
And you know what? Democrats just decided they had had enough. After years of fighting about this and pleading and promising and fuming and plotting and threatening over and over and over again, that they would do something about this if Republicans kept it up, today, Democrats finally actually did something. You could have knocked me over with a feather. They called for an appeal of a parliamentary ruling on the floor of the Senate by a majority vote, they overturned the parliamentarian`s ruling. It seemed like kind of a quiet exchange, but in doing that, they changed the rules of the United States Senate, so Republicans cant just block judges anymore. Judges can be blocked on an up or down vote, on a majority vote, like always, but they cannot be blocked anymore with just a minority of votes. Republicans cannot force that anymore. And I know, as Im hearing myself saying it, I know that it sounds like its not that much of a change, but this is a huge freaking deal. This is like 3-inch headlines. This is like people who dont even care about politics really ought to care about this.

<TEXT> Aside from the Russian scandal growing day by day, piece by piece- the most newsworthy thing in the last few days was not the Comrade trying to slander Susan Rice, act like he was disempowering Baby face Bannon, nor empowering his sneaky daughter- but rather, his Secretary of State- Rex Tillerson- a man who just last week said that he really didn't want to take the job, but his wife talked him into it- after North Korea fires off another test missile on Tuesday, said that he "has no more talking to do about North Korea". Really Rex? Isn't that all a Secretary of State does, is talk? Disturbing. We need to get rid of this entire lot of amateurs ASAP. The world's future depends upon it. </TEXT>

The Washington Post reported last week that three officials from the NSC collected and distributed documents to House Permanent Select Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who is investigating contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials during the election. Nunes held a news conference and briefed the president on those documents, which he said suggested that Trump associates were the subjects of incidental and legal surveillance by the Obama administration. </TEXT>

Trump's mention of wiretapping drew attention away from U.S. intelligence agencies having said that Russia tried to help Trump in the election against Democrat Hillary Clinton by hacking leading Democrats and spreading disinformation.

Moscow denies any such activities. Trump has also dismissed them.

Nunes told reporters on Wednesday that he had briefed Trump "on the concerns I had about incidental collection and how it relates to President-elect Trump and his transition team and the concerns that I have." </TEXT>

Without citing any names, FBI Director James Comey confirmed at the committee's public hearing last week that the FBI was investigating possible Russian ties to Trump's campaign as Moscow sought to influence the 2016 election. Stone said he was anxious to testify in public. </TEXT>

At least one person could be seen prone on the ground, tended do by ambulance staff. An air ambulance landed on the grass of Parliament Square, and medical crews rushed in. However, they soon stepped back, and there was no sign of anyone being taken away.

While police looked clam, dozens of armed officers could be seen in the area. At one point, a group of about a dozen officers armed with guns arrived, some also carrying shields. They marched into parliament. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Minutes after the incident, an emergency services helicopter landed in Parliament Square, as sirens were heard outside.

Air ambulance medics came from the helicopter to assist the casualties.

Two people lay on the ground in the yard. One of them appeared to have had clothes removed as emergency workers attempted to resuscitate the pair.

Parliament Square was closed to traffic.

An ambulance entered the gates to New Palace Yard.

Witness Don Brind told the Press Association he heard shots being fired and saw two people apparently injured on the ground.

Brind, a researcher for MPs, said: I heard some shouting and saw some running out of the corner of my eye and then a short time after that there was a shot. I looked and I saw a civilian on the ground, with somebody standing over him with what I assumed to be a gun.

Then I looked and about 10 yards away, there was a yellow jacketed person on the ground, who appeared to be alive and talking.

He said he assumed the person in the high-visibility jacket was a police officer.

Pictures emerged of a car having crashed into the railings of Parliament at the end of Westminster Bridge

Press Association reporter Laura Harding, who was in Westminster at the time of the incident, said: Everyone has been evacuated into Central Lobby, including a group of schoolchildren and kitchen staff.

Around 15 schoolchildren aged around 10, with armed police coming through the lobby now.

The children are really calm, the teachers are comforting them.

Everyone is standing around on their phones.

There are also a bunch of young people from the Hammersmith Boxing Club in their tracksuits and the British Lionhearts boxing group.

Dennis Burns, who was just entering Parliament for a meeting when the security alert happened, told the Press Association: As I was coming through the doors at Portcullis House, a policeman grabbed someone who was coming in and threw him out.

As we were coming though the glass doors I was told by one security guard to get out while another one told me to get in.

As I walked in I heard a security guard get a radio message saying a policeman has been stabbed.

Then I walked in as police officers and security start rushing out of the front doors on to the street.

When I got inside I was wondering what the hell was going on and I saw dozens of panicked people running down the street. The first stream was around 30 people and the second stream was 70 people.
It looked like they were running for their lives. </TEXT>

German media have reported that Erdogan plans to visit Germany this month to rally the estimated 1.4 eligible Turkish voters living here to support a package of new presidential powers in an April 16 referendum.
Erdogan repeated his criticism of Germany and other European countries on Tuesday, saying today's "Fascist and cruel" Europe resembled the pre-World War Two era. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The rebuke from Volker Bouffier, vice chairman of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, reflects growing exasperation over Erdogan's assertions that Germany and other European powers were using Nazi tactics by banning Turkish political rallies in their territories.
"Enough is enough," said Bouffier, who is also premier of Hesse state where the financial capital Frankfurt is located. "Mr. Erdogan and his government are not welcome in our country, and that must be now be understood," he told DLF radio.
German media have reported that Erdogan plans to visit Germany this month to rally the estimated 1.4 eligible Turkish voters living here to support a package of new presidential powers in an April 16 referendum. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A hospitality tent has been erected just inside the gates of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant near Pripyat in Ukraine. The tent has many windows, to ensure everyone gets a good view of whats about to happen.
These guests are here to witness the final stage of a 30-year clean-up job that has been underway, on and off, since one of the plants reactors exploded in 1986. The Chernobyl disaster still casts a pall over nuclear power. And other serious accidents, such as that at Fukushima in Japan in 2011  the only other incident to be classified a maximum Level 7 in the seven-point International Nuclear Event Scale  are weighed against it.
It also set in train a series of measures to ensure nuclear safety around the world. Now the whole site is about to be encased inside a vast structure known as the sarcophagus, sealing in some of the most dangerous waste material in the world for at least 100 years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was quoted as saying on Sunday that his ZANU-PF party and the people saw no viable successor to him for general elections in 2018.
"They want me to stand for elections, they want me to stand for elections everywhere in the party ... The majority of the people feel that there is no replacement, successor who to them is acceptable, as acceptable as I am," he said in comments to state media ahead of his 93rd birthday this coming week.

<TEXT> Hours after Trump fired acting attorney general Sally Yates for refusing to defend his executive order banning certain immigrants and refugees, Democrats lashed out during a hearing held to approve his choice to lead the Justice Department. Amid concerns with information provided by his picks to lead the departments of Health and Human Services and Treasury, Democrats did not show up at another Senate committee at all.

The theatrics drew more attention to Trumps recent decisions and the growing bipartisan concern with his executive order Friday to implement a travel ban with virtually no consultation of top government officials or senior lawmakers.

But it also allowed Republicans to attack Democrats for holding up the formation of Trumps government. Ultimately, Democrats alone lack the votes needed to block any of Trumps nominees from eventually taking office  and there are no signs of Republican opposition to any of his picks.

During a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democrats criticized Trump for firing Yates and said that they would not support his nominee for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), because they do not believe he would ever stand up to Trump in a similar fashion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> EXECUTIVE ORDER
PROTECTING THE NATION FROM FOREIGN TERRORIST ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:Section 1. Purpose. The visa-issuance process plays a crucial role in detecting individuals with terrorist ties and stopping them from entering the United States. Perhaps in no instance was that more apparent than the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when State Department policy prevented consular officers from properly scrutinizing the visa applications of several of the 19 foreign nationals who went on to murder nearly 3,000 Americans. And while the visa-issuance process was reviewed and amended after the September 11 attacks to better detect would-be terrorists from receiving visas, these measures did not stop attacks by foreign nationals who were admitted to the United States.
Numerous foreign-born individuals have been convicted or implicated in terrorism-related crimes since September 11, 2001, including foreign nationals who entered the United States after receiving visitor, student, or employment visas, or who entered through the United States refugee resettlement program. Deteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter the United States. The United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism.
In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including honor killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.
Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes. Sec. 3. Suspension of Issuance of Visas and Other Immigration Benefits to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall immediately conduct a review to determine the information needed from any country to adjudicate any visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual seeking the benefit is who the individual claims to be and is not a security or public-safety threat.
(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President a report on the results of the review described in subsection (a) of this section, including the Secretary of Homeland Securitys determination of the information needed for adjudications and a list of countries that do not provide adequate information, within 30 days of the date of this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the report to the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence.
(c) To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening of foreign nationals, and to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists or criminals, pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas).
(d) Immediately upon receipt of the report described in subsection (b) of this section regarding the information needed for adjudications, the Secretary of State shall request all foreign governments that do not supply such information to start providing such information regarding their nationals within 60 days of notification.
(e) After the 60-day period described in subsection (d) of this section expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion on a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of foreign nationals (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas) from countries that do not provide the information requested pursuant to subsection (d) of this section until compliance occurs.
(f) At any point after submitting the list described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security may submit to the President the names of any additional countries recommended for similar treatment.
(g) Notwithstanding a suspension pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or pursuant to a Presidential proclamation described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked.
(h) The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall submit to the President a joint report on the progress in implementing this order within 30 days of the date of this order, a second report within 60 days of the date of this order, a third report within 90 days of the date of this order, and a fourth report within 120 days of the date of this order. </TEXT>

<TEXT> EXECUTIVE ORDER
Sec. 7. Expedited Completion of the Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall expedite the completion and implementation of a biometric entry-exit tracking system for all travelers to the United States, as recommended by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.

(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President periodic reports on the progress of the directive contained in subsection (a) of this section. The initial report shall be submitted within 100 days of the date of this order, a second report shall be submitted within 200 days of the date of this order, and a third report shall be submitted within 365 days of the date of this order. Further, the Secretary shall submit a report every 180 days thereafter until the system is fully deployed and operational.

Sec. 8. Visa Interview Security. (a) The Secretary of State shall immediately suspend the Visa Interview Waiver Program and ensure compliance with section 222 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1222, which requires that all individuals seeking a nonimmigrant visa undergo an in-person interview, subject to specific statutory exceptions.

(b) To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of State shall immediately expand the Consular Fellows Program, including by substantially increasing the number of Fellows, lengthening or making permanent the period of service, and making language training at the Foreign Service Institute available to Fellows for assignment to posts outside of their area of core linguistic ability, to ensure that non-immigrant visa-interview wait times are not unduly affected.

Sec. 9. Visa Validity Reciprocity. The Secretary of State shall review all nonimmigrant visa reciprocity agreements to ensure that they are, with respect to each visa classification, truly reciprocal insofar as practicable with respect to validity period and fees, as required by sections 221(c) and 281 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1201(c) and 1351, and other treatment. If a country does not treat United States nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas in a reciprocal manner, the Secretary of State shall adjust the visa validity period, fee schedule, or other treatment to match the treatment of United States nationals by the foreign country, to the extent practicable.

Sec. 10. Transparency and Data Collection. (a) To be more transparent with the American people, and to more effectively implement policies and practices that serve the national interest, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall, consistent with applicable law and national security, collect and make publicly available within 180 days, and every 180 days thereafter:

(i) information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been charged with terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; convicted of terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; or removed from the United States based on terrorism-related activity, affiliation, or material support to a terrorism-related organization, or any other national security reasons since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later;

(ii) information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been radicalized after entry into the United States and engaged in terrorism-related acts, or who have provided material support to terrorism-related organizations in countries that pose a threat to the United States, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and

(iii) information regarding the number and types of acts of gender-based violence against women, including honor killings, in the United States by foreign nationals, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and

(iv) any other information relevant to public safety and security as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, including information on the immigration status of foreign nationals charged with major offenses.

(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

Sec. 4. Implementing Uniform Screening Standards for All Immigration Programs. (a) The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall implement a program, as part of the adjudication process for immigration benefits, to identify individuals seeking to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis with the intent to cause harm, or who are at risk of causing harm subsequent to their admission. This program will include the development of a uniform screening standard and procedure, such as in-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that the applicant is who the applicant claims to be; a process to evaluate the applicants likelihood of becoming a positively contributing member of society and the applicants ability to make contributions to the national interest; and a mechanism to assess whether or not the applicant has the intent to commit criminal or terrorist acts after entering the United States.

(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of this directive within 60 days of the date of this order, a second report within 100 days of the date of this order, and a third report within 200 days of the date of this order.

Sec. 5. Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for Fiscal Year 2017. (a) The Secretary of State shall suspend the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days. During the 120-day period, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the USRAP application and adjudication process to determine what additional procedures should be taken to ensure that those approved for refugee admission do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States, and shall implement such additional procedures. Refugee applicants who are already in the USRAP process may be admitted upon the initiation and completion of these revised procedures. Upon the date that is 120 days after the date of this order, the Secretary of State shall resume USRAP admissions only for nationals of countries for which the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence have jointly determined that such additional procedures are adequate to ensure the security and welfare of the United States.

(b) Upon the resumption of USRAP admissions, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, is further directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individuals country of nationality. Where necessary and appropriate, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall recommend legislation to the President that would assist with such prioritization.

(c) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I have determined that sufficient changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest.

(d) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I determine that additional admissions would be in the national interest.

(e) Notwithstanding the temporary suspension imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the admission of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest -- including when the person is a religious minority in his country of nationality facing religious persecution, when admitting the person would enable the United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement, or when the person is already in transit and denying admission would cause undue hardship -- and it would not pose a risk to the security or welfare of the United States.

(f) The Secretary of State shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of the directive in subsection (b) of this section regarding prioritization of claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution within 100 days of the date of this order and shall submit a second report within 200 days of the date of this order.

(g) It is the policy of the executive branch that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees. To that end, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement.

Sec. 6. Rescission of Exercise of Authority Relating to the Terrorism Grounds of Inadmissibility. The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, consider rescinding the exercises of authority in section 212 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182, relating to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, as well as any related implementing memoranda. </TEXT>

<TEXT> PROTECTING THE NATION FROM FOREIGN TERRORIST ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:Section 1. Purpose. The visa-issuance process plays a crucial role in detecting individuals with terrorist ties and stopping them from entering the United States. Perhaps in no instance was that more apparent than the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when State Department policy prevented consular officers from properly scrutinizing the visa applications of several of the 19 foreign nationals who went on to murder nearly 3,000 Americans. And while the visa-issuance process was reviewed and amended after the September 11 attacks to better detect would-be terrorists from receiving visas, these measures did not stop attacks by foreign nationals who were admitted to the United States.

Numerous foreign-born individuals have been convicted or implicated in terrorism-related crimes since September 11, 2001, including foreign nationals who entered the United States after receiving visitor, student, or employment visas, or who entered through the United States refugee resettlement program. Deteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter the United States. The United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism.

In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including honor killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.

Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.
Sec. 3. Suspension of Issuance of Visas and Other Immigration Benefits to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall immediately conduct a review to determine the information needed from any country to adjudicate any visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual seeking the benefit is who the individual claims to be and is not a security or public-safety threat.

(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President a report on the results of the review described in subsection (a) of this section, including the Secretary of Homeland Securitys determination of the information needed for adjudications and a list of countries that do not provide adequate information, within 30 days of the date of this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the report to the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence.

(c) To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening of foreign nationals, and to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists or criminals, pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas).

(d) Immediately upon receipt of the report described in subsection (b) of this section regarding the information needed for adjudications, the Secretary of State shall request all foreign governments that do not supply such information to start providing such information regarding their nationals within 60 days of notification.

(e) After the 60-day period described in subsection (d) of this section expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion on a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of foreign nationals (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas) from countries that do not provide the information requested pursuant to subsection (d) of this section until compliance occurs.

(f) At any point after submitting the list described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security may submit to the President the names of any additional countries recommended for similar treatment.

(g) Notwithstanding a suspension pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or pursuant to a Presidential proclamation described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked.

(h) The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall submit to the President a joint report on the progress in implementing this order within 30 days of the date of this order, a second report within 60 days of the date of this order, a third report within 90 days of the date of this order, and a fourth report within 120 days of the date of this order. </TEXT>

He added: "Withdrawal effects a fundamental change by cutting off the source of EU law, as well as changing legal rights.
"The UK's constitutional arrangements require such changes to be clearly authorised by Parliament."
The court also rejected, unanimously, arguments that the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly should get to vote on Article 50 before it is triggered.

<TEXT> Excess fluid that has accumulated in the body during the day makes its way from your cells into the bloodstream. From the bloodstream it then moves into the kidneys. When you wake up in the morning, you go to the bathroom and urinate this extra fluid away. When you weigh yourself after visiting the bathroom, you are usually at your lowest weight of the day.
Usually the more sleep you get the more weight you lose. Some lose more than others. I sleep 7 hours per night and lose approximately 1kg each night after urinating once during the night and again in the morning before weighing. </TEXT>

Oh that's right out of the two which were actually elected - one was backed by the Vatican and was the first to recognise its former wartime friend Croatia's independence - and the second a member of NATO.
And was it not another Pope who visited Croatia in the 1990s and honoured a WW11 Catholic bishop convicted of forced conversions and war crimes?

<TEXT> His reference is to Marine Le Pen - France's greatest threat.
Regarding Trump : he hasn't dropped a bomb or murdered anyone [yet] whilst Barack Obomber dropped 26,000 bombs last year.  That criminal should be behind bars, awaiting trial for War Crimes, as should Bush, Blair, Rice, Rumsfeld, Cheney, Powell, Clinton (personally responsible for the murder of Americans in Benghazi) and all those involved with the arms industrial complex and the PNAC.
Yet the morons are out on the streets protesting against Trump : where were you when Obomber was murdering across the Middle East ?  It is thanks to Obomber that Europe is now flooded with refugees.
Your double-standards are nauseating !
The wilfully ignorant are a truly dangerous gang of mobsters - Obomber has brought us into War and has destroyed utterly countries such as Libya!  
In fact, he has bombed 7 countries during his reign of terror.
Where were your protests during this Terrorist's murder raids each day, each 20 minutes of every day, for the past year ? Dropping bombs on homes, hospitals, on land, obliterating cities and infrastructure...Where were you ?

<TEXT> The unrest was the latest in a spate of violence in the country's penitentiaries, in which at least 126 people have been killed since the beginning of the year. The fighting is typically between members of rival gangs that compete for control of drug trafficking routes outside prison walls. 

A week after inmates first rioted at Alcacuz prison, riot police and other forces moved into the complex outside the city of Natal on Saturday. As a helicopter flew overhead, an armoured vehicle also entered the complex and later construction equipment was brought in.
