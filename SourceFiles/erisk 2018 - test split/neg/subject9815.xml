I don't need to hear that Madeleine is insecure about Abigail loving the young and effervescent Bonnie over her as often as Moriarty share; I don't need Jane's pained ruminations on Ziggy being genetically evil, which by the end is he or isn't he predisposed to evil based off his father?, but I can see how the constant and repetitive inner monologue and torture helped accurately portray a Survivor of Intimate Partner Violence like Celeste and her decision to stay with Perry. 

At the end of the book I couldn't decide if it was about the survival and resilience of women despite the disruptive and violent behavior of men, or just a conclusion that men suck? 

What did others think?

<TEXT> That's what I was thinking you were saying. I just wasn't sure because at least his outcomes have been almost across the board above career numbers. 

I actually found CRPerry13's most compelling argument not in the article but in the comments 

This season his FB/LD average exit velocity is 96.8 mph, which is right between Freddie Freeman and Bryce Harper, somewhere around 30th in MLB. In 2015 his same exit velocity was 93.0 mph, right betrween Jon Singleton and Wellington Castillo. His barrels per batted ball event was 3.6% in 2015. Now it is 12.2%.

Hopefully Marwin a) just keeps hitting dingers or b) becomes a contact hitter when we need him in that role.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wanted to do a year of bad presidents for uh obvious reasons. so I've only done Jackson of the three, because I'm a dumby like a lot of people and assumed he was the one impeached, he wasn't, and he was super popular. I can highly recommend the [HW Brands](http://www.audible.com/pd/Bios-Memoirs/Andrew-Jackson-Audiobook/B002V8KJ0K) biography. It's lengthy, but extremely thorough. 

The others I haven't read yet, but I am absolutely digging Robert Caro's LBJ series. LBJ is like what Trump wishes he was.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think now is a generally bad time for newbies to come just because you have some of us who like questions contained to daily stickied, highly visible threads, and some others who think that individual posts foster conversation. I came in as a newbie and am in no way affiliated with mods or the cliquey runners here, am fairly slow and an amateur runner, and have asked stupid questions, most of which were answered. 

What I think sucks is that sometimes people come here looking for validation (Do you guys think I could spontaneously run a marathon?) and don't respond to or contribute to constructive conversation. Imo that kind of newbie runner is shunned because they aren't here to genuinely participate in the discussion.  </TEXT>

Working my way through **Responsibility and Judgement by Hannah Arendt** I love the way Arendt thinks. I'm taking it slow, taking copious notes. 

Just started **Audacity of Hope by Jonathan Chait** half because I like Chait, and half because my presidential kick is getting a little ancient feeling. 

My half marathon this weekend helped me eat up hours in **Path to Power by Robert Caro** and I'll probably finish it today during my run commute. LBJ was something else.

### Training

Best described as everything that can go wrong will go wrong. I ran my first half marathon in November and finished really really poorly. 2:37. I attributed that to 1) not getting enough water during the race because I figured I was super human and wouldn't dehydrate and 2) under training. I set out a goal to stick with Hal Higdon's Intermediate HM 1 plan (I think), realized I was less than 13 weeks out already and just loosely followed it. At week 6 (or so) I signed up for a 15k as a tune up 4 weeks before the race. [Side note: for whatever reason April is consistently my worst running month, all the other months kick April's ass in terms of mileage total.] A week before my 15k I had flu like symptoms, may have fainted at work, and missed a whole week of training (and my race per the advice of my wife and doctor) and just felt bad about my chances going into the HM. I slowly got back on track, started foam rolling to deal with what I think might be ITBS and not just *general soreness* as I kept fooling myself into believing. 

But of course I felt like I had undertrained. My longest run before the HM was 8 miles, which I think shows a little bit in my splits miles 11-13. 

### Mile [1]

Probably my least favorite part of the race. The race was organized as both a 5k and a half marathon, and for some reason they started them both at the exact same time. My usual strategy is to start at the back because I figure a) I'm slow and b) it's more fun passing people than being passed. The race started in a parking lot before winding down to the bike path around Rockland Lake and my strategy of starting in the back just led to a frustrated and slow beginning. The path bottlenecked and people did not seem to be aware of how much space they were taking. Running passing lanes should be a thing. 

### Miles [2] to [6]
I was finally able to break away from the pack. My initial strategy was going to be slow first 5k, fast 10k, and then just finish as strong as possible. The slow first mile threw me for a loop and I had to adapt a little bit. I was able to get in with a good paced group of three other people I didn't know and I drafted behind them until around mile 4 when they started to slow down. I am extremely grateful to one bald runner who was just at the right pace for me, but who I suspected was just really great at pacing himself and would pass me later. 

### Mile [10]
[Note: At about mile 7 I got passed by my early pacing buddy. He kicked it into a pace I would not have been able to maintain]

Dreaded mile 10. The hook half marathon ran one loop around Rockland Lake, turned out into the streets of Valley Cottage/Nyack and then ran over to Nyack beach. The beach is located at an elevation dip and runs flat for about 1.5 miles. The course ran down one entrance, to the other, and then back. 

Just at the end of mile 10 is a steep incline that runs for about 1/4 to 1/3 of a mile. Strava says 227 ft, and I'm guessing it's all in that final hill. An award was given to the fastest female and male runners up the hill. That was not me. 

One of my implicit goals of any race I do is to finish running. This hill tried that goal, but I was able to get it done. My time shot up, my energy reserves felt depleted, but I made it up the damn hill. 

(Thank also here to my wife for recommending routes to run during my training in her hometown that were very steep, very demanding.)

### Miles [11] to [13.1]
After the hook mountain hill I was beat and back to my *why do I sign up for these things, why would I want to run anything longer than a 10k, please just end me now* mindset. But I also had two personal and vindictive goals to reach. 1) I want to be the fastest member of my wife's family. Her extended family has some marathon runners, but we're talking 5 hour marathon runners, and I felt with enough training and consistency I could accomplish my goal. (I just barely edged her cousin who just completed the United NYC Half at 2:17:19. Per Strava I finished 2:16:33) The second was something my wife told me just before the race. She said "I don't think it's possible to shave off 20 minutes since your last half in November."

I'm sometimes a petty runner, using any negative energy, not that hers was overly negative, to get things going. It helps that the last 2 miles were relatively flat around the lake. So with all that I came in at 2:16:33! A new PR and shaving 20 minutes off my half time. 

### What's next?

Queens half marathon in November. This will be a re-race for me and hopefully I can get my time down to below 2:10. I'm also really pumped for this because they redrew the course and are running through the park that I got my start running in.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Based off the life changing experience reading Born to Run by Christopher McDougall, I knew that in addition to training for my next marathon I needed to make a change in my diet. 

Persistence Hunting! What was it? Was it for me? Could I successfully change my diet and lifestyle by spending hours stalking my prey until they finally died? What would that look like? 

As I live in Brooklyn, this proved challenging. To simulate the deer/antelope stalking experience, I began to spend my Saturdays on stalking missions. Each week my goal was different.  I would jog a considerable distance and then pop into a bodega. In the first one I would find my target: strawberry frosted poptarts. I allowed myself the briefest look, just close enough to motivate me to continue on, then I would extricate myself and continue my stalking mission. 

The next bodega I allowed myself a touch. 

Until finally I collapsed next to the friendly bodega cat, feeling their dry tongue licking up my perspiration, and I would cave and buy the pop tarts. 

Someday: real antelopes.  </TEXT>

I know it says that it doesn't include xenophobia et al but I want to know how it responds to varying culture? Does it incorporate it under a civic relativity?

<TEXT> Except in the article where they point out that there is some contention among legal scholars over whether or not it is possible. 

In fact, the Antiquities Act does not address whether presidents even have the power to rescind national monument status, and legal scholars disagree on this point.

And both their sources surprisingly fall on the [conservative](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865676704/Conservative-think-tank-concludes-Trump-can-rescind-Bears-Ears-Monument.html) side or the [liberal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/no-president-trump-cant-revoke-national-monuments/2017/03/29/35e53336-10cd-11e7-ab07-07d9f521f6b5_story.html?utm_term=.8a37eb26bc17) side.

**Complaint:** Not that it matters, but I didn't notice before and  I don't think the race has medals. Just a t shirt. 

**Confession:** I missed a week of training and don't feel ready, but I'm going to leave it all out there. I feel better about this one than about my first.  </TEXT>

I read *Evicted by Matthew Desmond* which just won the Pulitzer unless I misremember. It's about the housing crisis in Minneapolis. Great read. 

In the last couple years I think *The Spirit Catches You And You Fall Down by Anne Fadiman* was the best I read. It's about the social service response to a Hmong child dealing with epilepsy and the clash between Western and Eastern cultural practices. Highly recommend.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Discussion] Maria Semple's "Today Will Be Different" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-25 15:29:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This was my fiction buffer. I've read *Where'd You Go Bernadette?* as well, so I was familiar with Semple's style. 

*Today Will Be Different* is a one day sampling of the life of a former cartoon animator as she struggles to deal with her missing husband, her Seattle suburban/white bread life, and her strained relationship with her sister. 

On the level of language, even the choice of the slightly disturbing-sounding steakfish creates a sense of uneasiness and absurdity.

From [NY Times Review](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/books/review/maria-semple-today-will-be-different.html)

I felt the beginning was too quirky and too manic. Which I know was the point, but reading Semple is like a rom-com about a manic pixie dream girl but from the MPDG's perspective. It's refreshing while at the same time there are moments of absurdity where I had to stop myself and really think it was over the top or not. (I mean she hires an adjunct professor to be her existential guide nee poet.) 

The book was exactly what I needed though after slogging through some heavy non fiction. It's light, funny, and has the occasional deep moment of bitter self loathing. The self loathing and pity of course always wrapped up in some caustic humor. 

Did anyone find the book too unbearably quirky to continue? There were so many details I could see it as extraneous and off-putting. 

The ending too was both neat and dangling. One relationship arc gets resolved (which in hindsight I like because marriages should be more about compromise and continued work rather than drama and blow up) and another just gets a one line put off. 

What did others think of the book?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Was reading Seattle native Maria Semples new book. When she was describing some scenario involving her husband she included, "It's October so the Mariners are playing playoff baseball." It totally took me out of the story and made it unbelievable to me. Only then in the next paragraph she pointed out her made up scenario and concluded "the Mariners would never be in the playoffs."  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This has absolutely not happened just this one time. Arguably this was why Buchanan won in 1856. Republicans were a relatively new party and split the vote with Know-Nothings. It seems like a lot of those early 1800s presidency's got thrown to the house to make the decision as well. Quincy Adams over Jackson was another one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you have any specific examples? I actually really liked their Le Pen article from today, and it makes more sense. I give credit to Nate for mostly focusing on the statistical aspect of things. I'm not pro-Trump though so I can see how that can be frustrating because they're definitely more on the negative side, but I think just journalistically there is a lot to cover negatively about Trump.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-takeaways-from-the-georgia-6-special-election-results/) sums it up really nicely. I think the biggest takeaway is the nationwide pro-Democrat environment. Ossoff wasn't necessarily supposed to win, that would have been the icing on the cake, he was supposed to outperform, which he did. 

From here it's going to be about controlling the narrative, don't let it become subverted to Democrat loss after loss and instead talk about gains versus traditionally deep Republican seats.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Kim Stanley Robinson's - 2140 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-18 15:22:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I picked this up because the concept of a submerged NYC fascinated me, and as a NYC resident I felt an even deeper need to read it. 

I appreciate that Robinson is able to do what John Dos Passos accomplished with his Manhattan Trilogy, making NYC into a fully developed character in the story. In some ways 2140 is a love letter to the city, digging up old history, famous residents, changing neighborhoods, community resilience, all while discussing rising tides and water levels. 

The book is basically about climate change and the way it will redesign or coastlines, and possibly our living habits, but towards the end (and with a tease in the beginning) Robinson injects political intrigue around financial speculation and bailouts. 

The book felt a little long, a little thin in places, but overall it was a great read. What did others think? Was anyone put off by the conclusion and the political leaning?

<TEXT> https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/64s17z/wp_after_many_years_of_a_friendship_that_has/dg4rq99/

I cease to exist. Intermittently. When Imle leaves the room, I am no longer in existence. They're quite like gaps in my memory, little fractures that interrupt whatever we are doing.

Imle went to the bathroom. I poofed out of existence. And then he was instantaneously back, because I don't register time. A wonderful thing as the anxieties that I assume were implanted into my brain now seem so inconsequential.

Imle says he didn't know that I was a figment of his imagination. He seems unconcerned that we both have a memory lapse between my initial non-existence to my current.

"I was probably lonely," he says to me, before dipping out of the bedroom.

Now that Imle understands the scope of our relationship he's been avoiding me. I can of course come out of my own volition if Imle's guard is down, but I can't simply follow him around. 
There are rules that I don't fully understand, or even understand who made the rules.

The worst part is my implanted hobby is reading. How am I supposed to read books if I have no corporeal form? If I am merely the whimsical manifestation of some dropout college student.

I appear in a club. Imle has other friends, all the more reason my existence is baffling to the both of us. He nods his head at me and then moves from the small circular table to the dancefloor. I don't poof out of existence even though he becomes obscured by ecstatic bodies brushing against him. I reach out for his leftover drink and for a second my brain tingles, a short electrical sensation that sends little tingles up and down my arm, and then I'm holding onto the cold perspiring glass.

I lift it to my mouth and then drink the dregs. It's refreshing, and I'm lightheaded, but I know these are all just manifestations to seal the deal. I dash the glass onto the ground and a loud shatter startles me. I turn back to the table and Imle's glass is back where I left it.

Imle is dancing on the dancefloor, enjoying himself, and disregarding me. I clinch my fist and reach for his glass again. How many of us were there? I remembered interacting with others? I had real memories, not just the minutiae left behind by Imle to sell my existence to the both of us. Where were they?

And how could we take down Imle? </TEXT>

Imle says he didn't know that I was a figment of his imagination. He seems unconcerned that we both have a memory lapse between my initial non-existence to my current.  

"I was probably lonely," he says to me, before dipping out of the bedroom.  

Now that Imle understands the scope of our relationship he's been avoiding me. I can of course come out of my own volition if Imle's guard is down, but I can't simply follow him around. There are rules that I don't fully understand, or even understand who made the rules.  

The worst part is my implanted hobby is reading. How am I supposed to read books if I have no corporeal form? If I am merely the whimsical manifestation of some dropout college student.  

I appear in a club. Imle has other friends, all the more reason my existence is baffling to the both of us. He nods his head at me and then moves from the small circular table to the dancefloor. I don't poof out of existence even though he becomes obscured by ecstatic bodies brushing against him. I reach out for his leftover drink and for a second my brain tingles, a short electrical sensation that sends little tingles up and down my arm, and then I'm holding onto the cold perspiring glass.  
I lift it to my mouth and then drink the dregs. It's refreshing, and I'm lightheaded, but I know these are all just manifestations to seal the deal. I dash the glass onto the ground and a loud shatter startles me. I turn back to the table and Imle's glass is back where I left it.  

Imle is dancing on the dancefloor, enjoying himself, and disregarding me. I clinch my fist and reach for his glass again. How many of us were there? I remembered interacting with others? I had real memories, not just the minutiae left behind by Imle to sell my existence to the both of us. Where were they?  

And how could we take down Imle?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think we will more so see social media continue to operate the way that Obama utilized it ie indirectly and with an emphasis on photography. If you contrast what Trump accomplishes with twitter, rile up the base at the expense of the larger audience, and contrast it with Obama sneaking up on a kid who fell asleep waiting to meet him, they both set tones that are completely useless to their policy making. Social media doesn't have significant enough of an impact to overcome bias, it usually only reinforces it. 

Honestly I think most people who aspire to be president do so with some intention of maintaining their private person. At best social media use seems contrived and at worse it reveals to much and infantilizes our leaders. Where is the benefit to nation leading and policy making? </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I see happening  is that people who have a moral opposition to homosexuality are going to cry "judicial activism" in order to suggest that all laws are a) meant to be upheld despite their constitutionality/unconstitutionality because the legislature has never been fallible and should self correct and b) original intent excludes interpretation from the decision. 

To the second point I'd like to implore people to read Circuit Judge Posner's first 4 paragraphs on page 24 of the actual [decision](http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display Path=Y2017/D04-04/C:15-1720:J:Wood:aut:T:fnOp:N:1942256:S:0)

<TEXT> The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. 

Also means the above, the 9th amendment, is a contradiction in a contradiction. How does anyone reconcile the fact that Constitution literally contains an ambiguous statement that there are things not in the Constitution still protected/available to the citizenry.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I downvoted you because judicial activism is hyperbole to prevent judges from doing their job. Judges do not assess moral or immoral dilemmas, they determine whether or not a law is constitutional or unconstitutional within the scope of the text presented AND modern interpretations and applications of that text. The conservative leaning justice in this decision gave a reasonable argument that not only speaks to the Civil Rights Act but also provides multiple other lines of reasoning. 

I personally hate that Trump is president because it will be easier to gloss over Obama's faults because of Trump's incompetence. Trump is making Obama look better than he should look.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nobody is entitled to a job but you should have the same entitlement to a job as someone of equal qualifications. Hence when the system (and the free market) continue to exacerbate socioeconomic difference based off x, y, z protected characteristic, then it's discriminatory behavior, and we expect our government to protect us equally from said behavior. 

Your example is weird because I imagine it would depend on the scope, so first of all she can not hire whomever she wants as long as it doesn't appear to be a pattern. And no lawyer would ever be able to prove that eye color was part of a pattern of discrimination. And then she was raped by an individual so she's allowed her prejudice? We protect her sensibilities towards non-actors because why? In the case where she was in a position to practice discriminatory hiring practices, I would imagine she should just seek mental health counseling to deal with her issues.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recently discovered [Pankaj Mishra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankaj_Mishra) who I've been diving into. He provides a non-western overview of the west. Most recently he published a book called Age of Anger about the rise of nationalism/populism in Europe and America. 

I would also recommend Eduardo Galeano's Las Venas Abiertas de Latina America. He's a fiction writer primarily, but came up as a journalist and all of his works focus around a rewriting of American history that decentralizes it from the United States. Hugo Chavez famously gave this book to Obama stating something to the effect of "if you want to understand Latin America, you have to read this" 

Edit: I'm going to also plug a professor I had in college [Andrew Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ross_(sociologist\)) He focuses more on the global cost of labor, but he's an extremely passionate and smart dude. His most recent books discusses defaulting on debt. He also was fairly instrumental in Occupy Wall Street, and was denied entry to the UAE because he was trying to expose bad labor practices.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> ~~I assumed the first blob was Sonny Gray, who I know is injured but he's the only possible option for second best in the AL West.~~ Misread your point. This is saying the #2 and #3 pitchers are relatively equal, hence  the bigger blob. and then the #4 is the big gap.  I'm not suggesting the A's rotation is bad, just questioning whether they're better than Cole Hamels, Shoemaker, Keuchel, and Felix Hernandez. Which I don't think they are. Especially when Cotton, Alcantara, and Triggs are in their first full season right? 

Also I knew I was going to screw up Manaea's name. I even had a tab open with a search for him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> obviously just dots on the line graph there but I assume that Graverman and Manea are the slightly bigger blob. This graph puts them slightly behind Keuchel and Shoemaker, and ahead of every single other pitcher in the West. The A's are obviously not garbage and I'm not suggesting they can't have the best rotation, but comparing to all other divisions they're the only one predicted to finish near the bottom of the division but with best rotation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> they result in different outcomes because percentages do not adequately represent what is actually occurring. And yes I do think there is a culturally and societal interest in not having 80% white doctors etc 

Show me the research for same sex education because what I've seen shows that girls do better in integrated classrooms but boys do worse but both of them suffer from segregation. 

Also the discrimination is what contributes to continued inequality of population in terms of representation. I didn't get into every single school I applied to, for whatever reason. Nor was I given a justification. Whites aren't owed a justification when they are knowingly applying to a field and school that they are over-represented in.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure what you're saying. OP's statement was using percentage of groups that presented with the same test grades and scores. Where this obfuscates actual number of accepted students. Surprisingly that's still extremely low for Black and Latino applicants. Hence the compelling need to accept a hire proportion of students with the exact same test grades and gpa as their peers. 

Affirmative action is not allowed in admission practices but diversity is a compelling interest. And yeah studies have increasingly shown that a diverse student body promotes a greater diversity of ideas, and elevates grades. etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> you could admit 68.7% of all Hispanic applicants and that would still equal 9 compared to 35.9% of all White applicants but that being equal to 25. The percentages don't reveal the disparity, but give people an out to argue against affirmative action which is constitutionally disallowed by the Supreme Court anyway. Why wouldn't you want a more diverse pool of students if they all present with the same grades and test scores as OP is suggesting.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure okay I get that on Jim Crow, but they didn't just spring up from a small collective of individuals going against trends. They had support by the electorate, and were enforced by individuals. I'm not sure how you conclude that this faceless entity of the government was the evil in that situation. 

People at the time didn't think it was reprehensible. Abraham Lincoln wasn't even sure if the Emancipation Proclamation was a legitimate use of government power. Much like people disagree on abortion, and people disagree on refugees. Each side will attempt to argue it. So my question again is, do Republicans believe it will work itself out organically? Because I'm not sure any situation supports that in the history of the United States.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is such a great nuanced answer that I appreciate but I'm struggling with understanding what Arlie Russell Hochschild calls "The Great Paradox" in reference to deregulation and less government intervention. Jim Crow also refers to the general attitude of discrimination that existed in the South right? Ie shop owners discriminating based off race, bus requirements, water fountains, schools etc. Is the Republican principle that it works itself out organically? Slash how does limited government respond to great moral issues like slavery? And most recently Hochschild talks about the environmental degradation in Southern states due to corporate overreach and the inability of the government to sanction or regulate. Do you agree that industry will regulate itself because it doesn't want BP oil spill like situations to occur? How does that respond to corporations that are only interested in the bottom line and will cut corners and skirt safety regulations to maximize profit?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I searched for DNC Mission statement and got this page here:

https://www.democrats.org/about/our-party

Which pretty much just says that everyone should get a fair shot regardless of x, y, z. Bit vague in my opinion, but I guess a mission statement isn't a place to get overly specific. ([this](http://www.christianpost.com/news/god-absent-from-democratic-conventions-mission-statement-81095/) is the second hit when you search DNC Mission statement, which is funny/great) 

Here is the RNC version: https://gop.com/platform/preamble/

So much longer and fleshed out here. There's more of an emphasis on government ("We believe the Constitution was written not as a flexible document, but as our enduring covenant." ie individualism and interpretation are not allowed here, laws should be rigid and enforced etc), some references to the general strong military lean ("As Americans and as Republicans we wish for peace  so we insist on strength. ") and references to a shared but exclusive culture and us vs them rhetoric ("They refuse to control our borders but try to control our schools, farms, businesses, and even our religious institutions."   "Every time we sing, God Bless America, we are asking for help.")

The parties also put out their platforms ahead of the RNC/DNC so those would be good places to look

Edit: Linking the preamble for the DNC to be fair https://www.democrats.org/party-platform#preamble

I find the actual construction of the two documents interesting. The RNC seems to be going for the old school mantra building (We believe, we believe, ad infinitum) whereas the DNC just straight up wrote an essay.

<TEXT> I went into this fairly apprehensive. I read and loved White Teeth, but then completely zoned out through On Beauty. 

While I did end up liking the story, for the first half of the book I kept asking myself "why is this happening now? what is the purpose in me reading about this person's life in such detail?" This was mostly resolved by the end but I feel that Zadie sometimes offers up too much detail. 

Do others think she was successful in exploring the dichotomy between discussing and studying black bodies in space/motion versus attempting to make a life out of it? (which seemed to be at least the alluded to theme with the narrator and Tracey.)

What was up with the weird Lamin, Ferm, narrator, and Aimee romance? 

How do others feel about the ending?

I get in three miles after my bus let's me off though because that's the distance from the stop to my home. If I didn't run from the bus I'd probably run to the bus in the morning to just get those 30 minutes in. And if that wasn't possible I'd probably try to squeeze in some time at lunch time. Usually running for about 20-30 minutes gives you more energy, makes you feel better all round, I'd say just find some time in your day where you can sneak it in, and see how it makes you feel.  </TEXT>

I know that you added the bit at the end about Federal versus state level politics, but isn't this still an issue on the Federal level? I'm thinking the crack down of farmers who are making opium/marijuana, the conversation around legalizing the production of substances per Calderon's comment to Obama about ending the drug war and legalizing to take the power away from cartel's (this may have been Fox). I agree to some extent that Trump will take have an impact, but wouldn't the failed/mixed success against demilitarizing towns in the North also play into the conversation? I know Pena Nieto eventually brought back the more militant approach to the cartels, so I'm not sure which party has the better solution here.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was insane. I knew this. Not in the classic situation of if you know there's a problem, then you can fix that problem. I had lost my mind. Understandably I thought.

After discovering I was the last person in my town of McAllen, Texas, I took a road trip around the United States and Mexico looking for others. Five years of dusty broken down towns, dwindling food supplies, and the transition of diarrhea to solid waste as my body adjusted to each town's water supply, and I was back in my hometown. Alone, and crazy.

Naturally I filled that void talking to myself and the inanimate objects that were all that was left behind of any other humans. 
Everything had something to say. I discovered that even in my garden the fruit and vegetables would chat loudly and without end. Sometimes about me. Often about me.

I needed reinforcements against the others, those not privy to arms and legs, so I began stealing mannequins from storefronts. My theft didn't go unnoticed, but I had the best lawyer in town who was able to argue before the judge that I was mentally incompetent, and so everyone just looked the other way as I went about my harmless crime spree.

My vegetable garden was still fiercely judgmental of my lifestyle, but I suspected it was a demoralizing effort to get me to stop eating them and their families. I didn't stop; I was a monster.

In the winter my mannequin compadres would bear the brunt of the elements due to my laziness in bringing them inside. Their voices grew harsh and scolding.

"You'll never amount to anything," One said.

"You have been a disappointment to us," Ten chimed in.

I ignored them and began to suspect that I might have self esteem issues that were exacerbated by the friends that I chose to surround myself with. I called my parole officer to discuss adding mental health services to my service plan but he was unavailable and I didn't have the persistence to try more than once.

Limbs quickly lost their cohesion, and my army of friends began to look like refugees of war. Eleven began to scream wordlessly and I had to take his head off and bury it in the yard.

It was then that I lost the trust of the rest of them.

I would watch them from my sliding glass doors and wonder at what they were plotting. How would they attempt to be rid of me?

I kept this vigilance up until I began to hear the quiet whisperings as they carried into my home.

It was inaudible and would stop when I slid the door open. In order to protect myself I snuck up behind the clique, now happily talking about the change in weather, the flowers blooming, and their growing friendship with the vegetables, and placed a battery powered recorder in the tall grass.

The next day I retrieved my device.

Hours of silence spun from the tiny micro-cassette with the occasional exaggerated shout, my voice, coming from the home, or directed at the clique of mannequins. My voice was varied, playing games to fill in all of the voices of my garden, and to hide the deep loneliness that was rubbing the veneer off my protective insanity.

Then as the tears slipped down my face, a daily occurrence, I heard the faint outline of "Help me."

It was a woman's voice. Not mine. I curled up under the table and rewound the tape.

"Help me," I said along with the recording. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is the Ultralight. I can't speak to that one specifically but the brand has been good to me. Depending on your need though it looks like the Ultralight doesn't have a chest   waist strap in the front like the Daylite does, and the Daylite also has snaps that compress the pockets and keep your items snug. I would just be worried about possibly overpacking the Ultralight.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recommend the Osprey Daylite but it might be a little out of your range. I've had only positive experiences with the bag. The zippers did pop out once when I overfilled it, but I discovered it was my fault for not clipping the sides in. They also have a cheaper bag without the internal laptop pocket the Osprey Ultralight. (I don't know why one is lite and one is light.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know how far you got, but definitely keep reading. The book excerpts about Lincoln are weird and off putting in the beginning in my opinion. (Heck the entire book might be in the beginning.) It takes awhile for the main characters to really get into a groove, and for the William Lincoln story to take off. But once I really dipped into the world I loved it. It's charming without getting too moralistic. 

I read a review where they described Saunders as being able to evoke compassion for the most degenerate and forgotten of people, and by the end of Lincoln in the Bardo he accomplished that for me.  </TEXT>

The former sharecropper/free black/slave walking with Lincoln out of the graveyard was a little too on the nose for me though.") </TEXT>

I'd really like to hit the bad presidents.

<TEXT> While I think it started out slow I very much liked it and when I think back on it, it ages well. It reminded me of The Semtex Girls and almost all of CivilWarLand, just truly bizarre scenarios looking at the human condition and response go tragedy. Etc. While the scenario could have used some flushing out it was the sharpness of the four main characters, the Reverend, and then the two boys/men who accompanied him, and Lincoln that really sold me on the book. I got a little emotional towards the end with the climax for the Reverend. 

But im also reading a Lincoln biography so I might have been more inclined to this personal and weird view of a big event in his life. 

Edit: On the back of my book jacket, Zadie Smith said Saunders was the funniest satirist since Mark Twain and tbh I'm not sure I see how that applies to this particular novel. So that bugs me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just to quibble this isn't really 2nd person point of view though right? Because we have a first person narrator in the story who is communicating to someone else also in the story. In my opinion a true 2nd person point of view operates as if the narrator is using the singular 2nd person and the reader is the intended target of the pronoun. "You went to the shopping mall so you could buy some oranges." 

I think the usage here is great though because it has the ominous first person, interrogating or cajoling some unseen off-screen individual. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There were whispers that marriage was initially servitude for women. Of course people are decent and love is not a modern invention, so not all marriages subjugated women, if they ever did. My parents married out of love. I married with what was possibly a combination of love and being tired of guarding the secret.  

I am a person who is easy to make intimate relationships with, and therefore subject to painful attacks of guilt when asked about my favorite color. I cannot share it with everyone, but I can easily feel bad for keeping it to myself. There have been friendships lost because I've lied about it, and in the subsequent moment when the other individual attempted to use that knowledge, and it did nothing; they became upset about my betrayel, I became upset about their coercion, and the whole thing fell apart.  

Marriage, at 35, was my escape from that. Nobody would think to steal away the control that my wife had over me. There are unwritten societal rules, and manipulating a spouse is one that few people are willing to break. There is no real adultery since one spouse holds absolute control, or in most cases both spouses go through a period of exerting control over the other and then get tired of the manipulation.  

In my case I haven't told my wife my favorite color in the 20 years since we got married. We are locked in battle. At first it was easy, thinking that we would reveal our favorite color to the other in the natural course of things. We were married now, and it was a sign of trust to reveal to the other your control word. It just never happened with us.  

The last five years my wife has been passive aggressively hinting that she'd like to take control. There are the constant comments about our failing marriage, the thinly veiled eyebrow raising at the overall blue of my wardrobe and any purchase which further color codes me, and the whispers in my ear when she thinks I'm sleeping.  

We have been through them all. A steady torrent of the color spectrum runs through my head as I drift off to sleep.  

My chest has grown heavier and my heart beats when I'm around her. I don't know how to tell her now that we've become locked in this war of attrition.  

I don't know how my preference will affect our marriage, or if she'd even believe me.  

I don't have a favorite color.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Might I recommend the works of [Pankaj Mishra](http://www.pankajmishra.com/) who admittedly does not write from a Western perspective but offers up a history of how Western democracy was formed and influential thinkers (such as Rousseau. whom he disagrees with). What I like is that if you come up in the Western system there is a certain level of exceptionalism that gets bred into you, and Mishra is helping me see American liberty and exceptionalism with a little bit more of an outside perspective. 

Otherwise I would recommend any of the classics: "Common Sense" by Thomas Paine, "On Liberty" by John Stuart Mill, "The Four Freedoms" by Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  </TEXT>

[Politico](http://www.politico.com/2016-election/results/map/president) has 3 mil for CA voting for Trump and 3.8 mil in Texas voting for Clinton. The Texas argument is probably better here too because Clinton was mocked for suggesting that Texas could be in play, and yet the margin was only about 800k.

[A Legend of the Future](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22067547-a-legend-of-the-future) by [Agustin de Rojas](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agust%C3%ADn_de_Rojas)   

Agustin de Rojas is considered Cubas Father of Science Fiction. His works are just now slowly getting translated into English with this one and The Year 200 happening in the last 3 years. 

[Los Angeles Review of Books Review](https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/between-saturn-and-havana/)

Additionally after the fall of the Soviet Union de Rojas was convinced-- and tried to convince others-- that Castro did not exist. Interesting guy who plays with form and offers up works that often times include self criticism within.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> At what point does an action of Trump affect his voter and support base in such a way that we start to see a more universal outcry against his Presidency? He has what like 80% approval rating with Republicans right? I feel like the most ardent Trump supporters are the ones who have yet to be affected by any of his actions, or feel somehow buy into the "Trump knows what he's doing" argument and believe that things will get better with continued faith.  </TEXT>

But I'm looking for a crowd sourced site so that when I plan out my runs I can know to expect a small shoulder/no shoulder on the road, sidewalks, something that's actually a highway or off ramp, etc. I kind of just look at a map right now and figure, I can probably do this.

Board of Education stated the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect a wall of separation between Church and State.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dale-hansen/yes-there-is-a-constituti_b_8171550.html) Mostly meaning to me that the Constitution isn't so rigid that you can apply it only to one specific instance, the Creation of a Christian State.

<TEXT> Our Constitution also compels individuals to practice a separation of church and state. It's undue burden because the state cannot create such laws that produce an undue burden for its citizenry, much like adapting or changing the law to accommodate one person's belief when there is a reasonable alternative to that solution. Ie just put her somewhere else. It's not persecution if you don't do your job especially when at will employment is essentially a thing. 

The second part you'll have to expand upon. Sharia Law I mean as in the religious belief of adherence to strict Quranic laws. So how would that not fall under free exercise of religion according to your proposition in the first part?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seems like undue burden to me? On the one hand (and keeping in mind I'm not as conversant in other protected classes outside of race) it sounds like it would create an unequal standard for marriage wherein another state could recognize the documents as not valid. Though this may have already come up in the Supreme Court. And on the other hand it seems foolish to adopt your laws to the whims of the personal beliefs of your employees who are merely refusing to follow the law/their job. In the extreme example and borrowing from the right here, this would pose problems for fundamentalist Muslims trying to invoke Sharia Law or some incorporate that into their work. It shouldn't become the expectation. If you can't do your job, no one can compel you and you should move on. This isn't an Eichmann scenario.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The GOP should reintroduce Comprehensive Immigration Reform. While this might seem contrary to the current political climate, I think a lot of what happens in Immigration is confusing and can be manipulated based on how you present information. The Border Wall is not popular, and even if it holds 50% support now, a huge tossing of capital at a useless project that will not see a reduction in drug violence or product will turn public opinion of all those but the most fervent. 

The GOP should sell tough on immigration while revamping the system so they can appeal both to the "they broke the law" group and to "the system is broken" group. Promote an increase in BPA, electronic surveillance, and fence improvements. Promote the dramatic decrease in border crossing because of Trump's rhetoric (40% I think), continue to inflate the number of deportations like under Obama but say it's a good thing, and while all that is happening push legislation to reform the system.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You keep using empathy as if it should be a thing in our political climate but I think everyone in this thread and subreddit knows that doesn't hold any water. Try arguing from empathy about undocumented immigrants in the United States and you'll get a response of "they broke the law. period." 

Religious beliefs trump political feelings... unless it overrides your ability to do your job. Is generally how I think that sentence ends on both sides. What I'm drawn to is Salmon Chase's opinion on slavery ie No law is just that deprives another man of life, liberty, etc. (paraphrase). I think on both sides to override a law from personal beliefs you'd have to argue with some certainty that you believed it to be completely immoral and damaging to the fabric of humanity as Chase did AND also realize that persecution is going to be expected. 

Again I think this is extremely complicated. Creating a third way of restructuring the law to accommodate one person's beliefs is not a good use of State power. She should've been fired or reassigned where she didn't have that power. (Which is maybe what happened eventually?)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that's where we encounter problems of actual utilization. Clearly Kim Davis was in the wrong by not issuing licenses to same sex couples professionally. But she probably should have been just quickly fired or reassigned instead of it becoming a public spectacle. This is where I think you have the confrontation of what is universally right comes in. 

Christians probably "persecute" the LGBTQ community as much as they are being persecuted in this instance. Because people feel so strongly about it. I don't know what the correct answer is for bakers and photographers here, because truly a member of the LGBTQ community probably won't willingly use someone who they know does not support their choices. (Why would you there's no way to compel them to even do a good job.) But a situation could arise in which they are faced with the only photographer or baker or etc. At that point do you defend the right to discriminate based off a characteristic you disagree with or use the state to compel that person to act against their moral beliefs? There clearly isn't an easy answer. Which is why I think the rhetoric gets so heated and divisive.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think part of the problem is a lack of vocabulary to address the issue. Democrats (I assume) believe in systemic oppression of historically marginalized groups. So everyone is in agreement that ideas are considered on their universal merits, but systemic oppression would have to be erased first, including the disproportionate representation of blacks and Hispanics in regards to poverty, imprisonment, participation in governmental institutions like Child Protective Services etc. In my opinion that's why when you are confronted with someone who willfully ignores your argument about a system of oppression, or runs campaigns focused on the scapegoating of cultures, races, genders, or uses pointless catchphrase terms like "political correctness" or "boys will be boys" (a tautology that means nothing btw) you can draw conclusions of racism, sexism, xenophobia. 

I'd also like to point out that that is mostly on the lower level, wherein Clinton ran a campaign that only highlighted Trump's actions and words and implied they might be inappropriate. But I'm not sure she ever described him as such.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  literally ones of eternity for these groups is a big problem.

I think that's the problem. We are dealing with opposing views on what universal rights should be. A defense of marriage / attack on gay marriage is strange because a) state marriage is not religious marriage and therefore is not an attack on Christians. Anything else presupposes that Christians want their view points applied to everyone within the state regardless of belief. Which is why that gets dismissed a lot. Same with  contraception and abortion tbh except contraception begins a conversation over a universal right to healthcare. So then we enter into the contradiction of beliefs, where one group thinks one thing should be/is universal and the other thinks the opposite. 

I don't know that I would call this persecution so much as political and cultural discourse over values and beliefs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In terms of historical examples of Trump, I think the best comparison is likely James Buchanan for his plurality victory, denouncement of the opposition party stating the Republicans were dangerous and geographical with bias against the South, and general political attitude. He was President prior to the Civil War but also represented views that were increasingly seen as out of date and challenged by more progressive parts of the country (slavery, Fugitive Slave Act, Dred Scott happened during his term as well). I've only encountered him peripherally in my reading so far (through biographies of Jackson and Lincoln, and White Rage by Professor Carol Anderson) but a lot of it seems to fit the Trump model </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I misremembered the details but it allows me to logically work through this. The Executive Memo specifically mentioned harboring in cases where USCIS is not aware of the immigrants presence, so Anne Frank not church sanctuaries known to the media et al. And I imagine providing services to persons without status isn't illegal because status isn't a requirement for receiving status ie federal law does not require La Raza to ask or provide documentation status when they do health services or general service. And someone can correct me here but I believe Immigration Law is Administrative Law and thus subject to the Executive Branch's enforcement. So would probably not have been illegal at the time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What exactly does La Raza do that constitutes illegal activity. Here's my guess: It sounds like the NCLR does similar work as to what my organization does ie provide immigration relief to immigrants in removal or deportation proceedings. During our staff meeting we had a segment about the legality of providing services to undocumented immigrants because apparently immigration law suggests that any service provided that allows the undocumented immigrant to remain in the United States is in violation of the law unless USCIS knows about the immigrant. It's still being discussed how this will be implemented.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This seems like a weird and unique occurrence. Some clarification I'd like

* It sounds like other presidents have done this in the past. To what extent did Obama expand the power? 
* If corporations were given incentive to donate the money to non-profit organizations rather than to the DOJ and consumers, how is this different than tax breaks? 

* What exactly is the uproar, that the DOJ was used to direct corporations to give to specific non-profits that may or may not have had left leaning progressive policies? Is this a problem if the money is distributed equitably? 
* Ie is this largely political or should we be concerned about this money going to non-profits versus going to the Treasury? 

Additionally this is my big take away here:
 Both the Government Accountability Office and Congressional Research Service have concluded that the settlement agreements do not violate Congress power of the purse. But others disagree.

At least at the moment this isn't seen as an illegal procedure and any controversy that erupts can only result in future thinking legislation or judicial action to rule on the constitutionality </TEXT>

<TEXT> An opinion piece. Which means that at least currently what was being done was within the accepted legal framework of our nation and if it isn't it needs to be sent to the judicial branch. I get that this might be an important issue to be outraged about, but it looks like Executive Overreach which a) hasn't been legislated and b) has not been thus far taken to court. So how is this at all relevant to Trump's empty talk and Democrats pushing back against his suspect appointments as political posturing or actual concern?

Edit: Would also like to point out that I'm not calling the Wall Street Journal fake news as I am re appropriating the term as used by Trump to discuss an opinion piece that you posted. I can recognize that opinion pieces support viewpoints which I might disagree with but aren't necessarily fact. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was more so going for reductio ad absurdem there since it sounds like you're discussing the Pell Grant program which supports low income students who are not financially able to attend university? Because otherwise student loans are largely private loans. And by that extension that you are referring to government-subsidized education for low income individuals removing that assistance will result in a reduction of low income participants in university settings. 

So I think civics might be a semantic or generational term because I did not learn civics in high school but I did take Government in high school. But it seems that the denotation of civics is the participation and rights of citizens within a governmental entity. Unless I'm mistaken the United States government is a representative democracy in which policy is created according to the mandate of the people. But also who cares about any of that, you stated that my opinion was irrelevant and I explained the meta aspects of debate, I don't think I have to mention that I could easily run for office and if a representative sample of people agree with my opinions I could make them into law. And even that is irrelevant because we are discussing from a layman's perspective the effectiveness of immigration policy and the morality of accepting refugees. If you wanted to offer a counter argument we could keep going, but it seems like you ran out of things to say and resorted to personal criticism. Which is fine. But it's boring.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Laws are the codified personal beliefs of a large group of people. People enter into debates based off their personal belief system, so mine and yours are as equally irrelevant and relevant in any conversation unless one of us is an expert and it refers to non-ethical/moral questions. 

What even are you talking about with the student loan program? Are you suggesting only higher income individuals should have access to university education? 

You don't believe that someone doesn't want to spend 20 some billion dollars on an ecological disaster that will prove relatively ineffective while ignoring the fact that Drug violence and economic instability is driven by American demand for illicit substances? Sounds like something the MSM is ignoring.

<TEXT> so yeah I'm also for Comprehensive Immigration Reform because our current immigration system is extremely backlogged and gives incentive to illegal immigration. The pathway to legal immigration includes provisions for self supportive immigrants and sponsors to vouch for the financial stability of immigrants. We were arguing about the merit of accepting low income immigrants or refugees. 

"victimizes our people" is hyperbolic nonsense. The presence of Trump supporters post them shooting those Indian Men in the face victimizing me, please deport Trump supporters preemptively and without further investigation or discrepancy.  </TEXT>

Here's a couple: [HuffPost](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/28/food-stamp-demographics_n_6771938.html) and then here is [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethhoffman/2013/09/23/who-receives-food-stamps-and-why-it-is-critical-to-continue-their-support/#2612d5ec5e49)

I said Trump's merit based immigration reform is stupid because we already have merit based immigration reform to a large extent and he's using America's ignorance of the process to demonize or scapegoat a particular group. Which is rather xenophobic (not rayciss) policy imo. 

Care to share with me how Mexico is raising ideological purists hell bent on destroying American values? Or Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua? Yeah you can't. And in reference to our the destabilized Middle East, that the Obama administration helped to further unrest after the Bush administration decided to try its hand at nation building, does personal responsibility only apply to people you don't like or is it actually part of your moral code and you're just ignoring it because these refugees from Syria are a little too brown?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trump's merit based immigration reform is entirely code for reduction of refugees, asylum cases, and anyone with a humanitarian interest in immigrating and anyone who makes the "not immediately on the dole" argument is ignoring the fact that our current immigration model requires you to pledge that you will not become a burden to the state and be financially sponsored by a US citizen who becomes responsible for you. 

Additionally the white American born demographic disproportionately benefits from and takes advantage of welfare services relative to overall population breakdown. So I'm not sure why this welfare queen myth keeps chugging. 

And again low income, or financially insecure immigrants, do not de facto become a burden or provide zero contributions. If you, and Trump, want to frame the conversation as ending humanitarian reasons for immigration, then go ahead, but pretending that it's because these people are useless is deflecting the responsibility.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I recall correctly this is still being litigated as in whether or not you can be deported without due process or if legal proceedings need to occur. I think that's the maelstrom we are building up to, explicitly defining what is guaranteed to non-citizens in the United States. 

Supreme Court has also created a test for free speech in which they can determine what is harmful and inciteful (shouting fire in a movie theater is always the example) and what isn't. But that doesn't really apply to political parties or presidents. 

The obvious solution would have been to change our sodomy laws long ago. But some would rather kick the can. Now Trump wants to enforce laws and is called a homophobe. That's the entire debate, our immigration laws have always been somewhat xenophobic and wax and wane depending on the economic climate to scapegoat the low-skilled labor force (c.f. The Chinese Exclusion Act). Which Mark Twain felt was racist despite it being current law. The point is I don't think, well it's established law, should free us from criticism.

Additionally if you try to do independent research yourself (cross the border illegally) you will probably be raped, taking advantage of, and there's a chance you'll die.

<TEXT> Diversity introduces differing perspective and challenges people to work harder to both meet a unique perspective/argument and respond to it. The SA article pointed out that if you prep a Democrat by saying heres a Democrat who disagrees with you vs heres a Republican who disagrees with you, the Dem will prep harder to work with against the Republican. Its in the links, its the rationale the Supreme Court uses to determine affirmative action cases with higher education like Grutter v Bollinger, UT Austin v. Fisher.  </TEXT>

Reynosa, Mexico

Israel stares out into the new ocean. Rio Bravo to Mar Bravo. A tempestuous monster that taunted those brave enough to attempt the crossing, the whispers of better wages, a better life. His mother had been lucky, receiving a visa to do low skilled labor, but what else did she know, traveling across the Rio every day and coming home with a little extra money. American dollars, green and crumpled with her sweat. 
Papa woke from his bed, hungover, drinking since the disappearance. His voice croaked and he beckoned Israel closer. 

Israel, dame agua, he wants water. Israel pours some from the faucet wondering now what will happen to their water supply. Millions of gallons of fresh water consumed by the Atlantic and Pacific oceans as they mingled violently in the Mar Bravo. 

The news went from bewilderment to passive acceptance. If an entire nation had disappeared, overnight, in the middle of the day, whenever, there would have been a large wave accompanying the loss of mass, a rushing of water to fill the void. Reynosa would have been destroyed, flooded by a tidal wave too high to understand, they would have disappeared with the United States. Instead a beach formed where people started getting used to the loss of the silt rich river water, for the stinging salt water. 

Nadia cambio? his father asked. Has anything changed. 
Israel and his father avoided their neighbors after the empty stares, those who knew what it was like to lose a family member, and those who wanted to offer their condolences without understanding the weight of it. 

Israel of course had the messages in his bottle. Three had come since the disappearance. Three letters that held his mother in an imagined land, each day forgotten by those in the world who wanted to pretend that there never had been an America, just the drifting peninsula of Mexico, and the cold island of Canada. 

But what about Alaska? Israel wondered. 

But what about my mother? </TEXT>

"What the fuck is your deal," she said, full of anger and resentment.

Flustered, "Excuse me? I just, what are you getting at?"

"What do you do," she continued.

Before I answer that there are some things I've discovered while living amongst the children. I'm not Jane Goodall observing these children recreate society, and frankly I don't want to know very much about how things are going. What I do know isfrightening to the only adult survivor of the over 10 disease. I said that I didn't want to think about pregnant children, but really it happens. You see some 6 year old waddling around and you think about how she's going to spend 10 months of her short life carrying another children, and you get depressed, and then you run to chase away that depression with endorphins. As a result of the disease, which I can speculate affected the DNA of everyone alive, as in your cells telomeres get long enough and then just give out. That's a speculation based off high school AP Biology, so that probably means nothing. Gestation periods seem to have shortened from 10 months to 3 months, and that's all I know based off observations and guesses. The other obvious question is how do children that are less than 10 years old maintain the utilities of society? Electricity, running water, reddit? Yeah I've been on reddit, that's the Jane Goodall part I was referring to. I'm not smart enough to know anything about this new society I just stole it off some public post on the reddit front page before deciding the internet wasn't for me anymore. Somehow in a process I'll never be able to explain, knowledge is passed on from generation to generation, and there is a boost to learning ability. 
What is not passed on is emotional maturity or any kind of physical development that allows these post disease children to be miniature adults. So I live with extremely knowledgeable but vindictive and bratty children, who know to keep me at a distance until they've decided if looking into the adult-ing process is worth investigating. 

So this productive member of society, without a grasp on her volatile emotions, was getting in my face, about what I did, "I'm chief counsel." 

"You run around town," she said.

"I'm training for a marathon," I responded quickly.

Because of the lack of physical development, they didn't place any importance on exercise, much less endurance training. 

"That's not conducive to our society," she said. "I've been your neighbor for a quarter of my life, and I've seen you waste hours running from your home to who knows where. I think it's time Town Leader reevaluates your importance to us." 

Punishment in town didn't really exist because of the short lifespan. Yes some people did get put away in prison for extended periods of time, but sentences were whimsical and soon forgotten. I could not imagine what her threat was, this miniscule matron. 

"I've had some talks with Chuck," she started, "and it he's thinking about how best to approach your unique situation. But, because he likes meand I shouldn't tell you this but I may be next in linehe's leaving the decision up to me."

She paused and tied her hair up with a hair tie from her wrist. 
Her eyes squinted and she scrutinized me before emitting a low chuckle that was mostly exhaled air. I wished, seeing these short humans dominating the world, that I had a background in sociology or a science. 

"I am willing to let these idolatry slide," she said, "if you'll do something for me." </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just finished this memoir by Hemon yesterday. Hemon is so adept at driving emotional daggers into reader's hearts, and concludes with the previously published [The Aquarium](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/06/13/the-aquarium) in which he details the hospitalization of his 9 month old for a tumor. 

While I bookmarked many many pages, it's this paragraph that I keep thinking about today

Much like Ella, Id found myself with an excess of words, the wealth of which far exceeded the pathetic limits of my own biography. Id needed narrative space to extend myself into; Id needed more lives. I, too, had needed another set of parents, and someone other than myself to throw my metaphysical tantrums. Id cooked up those avatars in the soup of my ever-changing self, but they were not methey did what I wouldnt, or couldnt, do. Listening to Ella furiously and endlessly unfurl the Mingus tales, I understood that the need to tell stories was deeply embedded in our minds and inseparably entangled with the mechanisms that generate and absorb language. Narrative imaginationand therefore fictionwas a basic evolutionary tool of survival. We processed the world by telling stories, produced human knowledge through our engagement with imagined selves.

<TITLE> Will Jennings v. Rodriguez shape Trump's Immigration Policy? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-01 16:05:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The Supreme Court began hearing arguments in [Jennings v. Rodriguez](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/jennings-v-rodriguez/?wpmp_switcher=desktop) which will primarily determine if detained unauthorized immigrants are apply to apply for individual bonds. Per [NPR](http://www.npr.org/2016/11/30/503902528/supreme-court-tests-whether-detained-immigrants-have-right-to-hearing) the court is divided along ideological lines. 

Does a ruling in favor of bond hearings, and therefore potential release of unauthorized immigrants awaiting trial rile up the anti-immigration feelings? Or does Trump avoid talking about it unless the outcome is in his favor?

Additionally what are the repercussions of detention without hearing for non-citizens? </TEXT>

Chao has experience both in presidential cabinets and in the department of transportation.  How will she help implement Trump's infrastructure plans?

<TEXT> Per the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/2016/11/18/9da9c572-ad18-11e6-977a-1030f822fc35_story.html) foreign diplomats are rushing to book stays in Trump hotels in the off chance of currying favor in the Trump administration while Trump hotels held raffles to other properties and encouraged diplomats to see what his business had to offer.  Earlier Clinton was criticized for her use of the Clinton Foundation  as a means for foreign operatives to gain access to the State Department.  Is this an established and acceptable norm of operating the federal government?  Ie were Trumps claims of impropriety against Clinton political posturing?  Or will we see an increased exposure and vigilance by the press and an anti establishment populace? </TEXT>

<TITLE> (spoilers) A Little Life, Jude St. Francis   Jude the Obscure </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-26 20:43:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just finished A Little Life and was pretty devastated. The ending was probably only the third time I've teared up over a book, and while I guess I could have seen it coming it was still pretty awful. What's worse was the death of Wilhem and Malcom. 

What kept reoccurring to me though, was just how awful Jude's life was and the obvious (I think) reference to Jude the Obscure. Now I haven't had the pleasure of reading Jude the Obscure (though I have read Tess of the d'Ubbervilles so I feel like I have some context) but I kept coming back to a quote by Stephen King in which he describes situations where the characters are so down trodden, so maligned, and abused by the writer that his situation becomes almost comical. While I'm not suggesting that I laughed at Jude's misfortune in A Little Life, it did begin to feel a little absurd when after being mistreated by Brother Luke, he was then placed in a group home where he was abused, ran away, and ended up with a doctor who continued to abuse him. 

In such a heart wrenching book in which the character was constantly in some place of misfortune how does Yanagahira avoid making Jude's life absurd with tragedy? 

I'm still digesting but I'm really interested in what everyone else thought of the book. 

EDIT: [Interview](http://www.liljas-library.com/showinterview.php?id=34) where King mentions: "every now and then I think of what Oscar Wilde said about The Little Match Girl. He said that its impossible to read about the little match girl without weeping tears of laughter and...you know something that is so sad its actually funny." I know he better discuss it in the introduction to *Blaze* but I can't find that online.  </TEXT>

Now I'm debating whether or not I should just finish it normally or save 2 - 3 hours for my HM in November. Any thoughts on running with audiobooks in general? Or suggestions on finishing it in training or during the race?  </TEXT>

Prospect Report: http://www.todaysknuckleball.com/al/houston-astros/astros-prospects-ramon-laureano-garrett-stubbs-earn-promotions/

I was talking with an Astros prospect guru the other day, and he asked me for a comp to Laureano. Because of their similar builds, my mind immediately went to the Astros superstar second baseman, Jose Altuve. But looking past the statistics and surface-level stuff, Laureano is that type of player. Hes involved in everything on the field, hes an aggressive, scrappy, smaller guy, and he has a surprising amount of pop despite his unassuming stature.

Astros seem to be stocking up on Jose Altuve type players.

Just watched the press conference. It didn't really seem to come to much in terms of what their meeting was about and Pea-Nieto reiterated that he has the interest of Mexicans living anywhere as his priority. I thought was interesting that Nieto stated he invited both candidates to discuss inter-nation relations, and Trump was the only one who responded.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Running with my Mutt </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-22 17:24:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Any advice for training my mutt to run with me? He's a 40lb pretty low to the ground possible pit bull mix. We put him in training for petsmart for all the basic essentials so he's pretty good at commands (especially when treated). When running though he has started tugging at the leash during the first steps or he'll shoot out in front and then get distracted and start veering not paying attention. Any advice for the leash tugging? </TEXT>
