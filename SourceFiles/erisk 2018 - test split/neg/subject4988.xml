<TEXT> Good question, since it looks like you might be in for quite a bit of sleet (and therefore less snow). According to the [scientific forecaster's discussion](http://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=NWS issuedby=LWX product=AFD format=CI version=1 glossary=1 highlight=off):

| As it currently stands...for DC/Balt...10th percentile is 1-4 [inches]...50th percentile is 4-8...and 90th percentile is 10-16. 

So it looks like there's a lot of variance in the forecast. South of DC probably means that you'll be in the 1-3" range if there's significant wintry mix. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sounds like you're absolutely on the right track since you've already got some research experience under your belt. Physics REUs are extremely competitive and many qualified students don't get accepted; I know that my school's REU acceptance rate is in the single digit percentages, and that we prioritize exceptional students who also attend a liberal arts college or a school with no research opportunities. Try chatting with (aka emailing) professors who work on topics that interest you and ask about any informal research opportunities. Start reading some of their papers. If nothing comes to fruition, ask around your own school for research projects. Continue honing your skill set -- depending on which field of research you want to do, that might mean going through some textbooks (especially if you want to do theory), or familiarizing yourself with commonly used software or programming (root if you want to do high energy experimental physics or astrophysics), or being comfortable in a machine shop or lab environment (maybe if you want to do condensed matter experiments). Also don't be afraid of applying for an internship that's outside your intended field of research -- so long as you find it interesting, it can be of huge benefit to you!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the 1920s, astronomers discovered that the universe is [expanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law). Imagine two dots sharpie-d onto the surface of a balloon as the balloon as it is being inflated: at any point in time, the two dots are growing farther apart from each other. This same effect occurs for two galaxies in our expanding universe; the distance between the two is growing, so that from the perspective of one galaxy (i.e., the Milky Way), the other (NGC 1332) is moving away at some velocity.

We can measure the velocity that a galaxy is receding from our view in the same way that you can hear the siren of an ambulance dropping in pitch (frequency) as it travels away from you. In both cases (of the ambulance siren and of the galaxy light), we know the frequency of the (sound and light) waves emitted. This [Doppler shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect) of frequencies allows us to know how fast the galaxy is moving away from us, which in turn, lets us know its distance precisely.

Finally, we can turn to a bit of [elementary physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation#Modern_form) in order to estimate the mass of the black hole. By measuring the speed of the swirling gas around the black hole (again, by the aforementioned method), scientists can estimate the mass of the central black hole. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're absolutely correct in saying that the space between stars is vast, and that the likelihood of any two stars colliding is quite low. The interactions become substantial when we focus on the gas and dust content-- although they have far lower densities than the density of Earth or the Sun, they pervade the interstellar medium. So when the Smith Cloud barrels through the Milky Way disk, its gas content will indeed be colliding with the Milky Way's gas and dust. You might interested in checking some of the state-of-the-art [simulations](http://www.space.com/28119-new-universe-evolution-simulation-is-most-realistic-yet-video.html) that keep track of dark matter, stars, and gas properties. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Do supernovae eject matter that far?

Yep, and in galaxies less massive than the Milky Way, supernova can eject *most* of the gas from the galactic disk.

 How would individual ejections gather separately from the milky way and then later collide?

Supernovae tend to affect their surroundings in three phases: 

1. The free expansion phase, in which the ejected mass (1-5 solar masses) expands in a blastwave shock.
2. The Sedov-Taylor phase, in which gas from the ambient interstellar medium is swept up. About 1000 solar masses of material can pile up, much of which gets propelled along the low-density channels up- and down-wards out of the galactic plane.
3. The radiative expansion phase, in which the gas cools in its new environment.

Multiple supernovae can eject lots of material out into the gaseous halo of the Milky Way. This small cloud can continue to gravitationally attract infalling gas outside of the galaxy, such that it grows substantially before falling back into the disk.

 I would think jets from quasar or possibly from the milky way during an active phase was more likely.

That wouldn't be a bad idea, except that the [phase space information](http://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/29/10/smithcloudtrajectory.jpg) (and sulfur-derived metal content) of the Smith Cloud suggests that it originated from the outer disk. </TEXT>

The solar system takes about [250 million years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_year) to around the Milky Way center, so it will only have completed 12% of a full rotation in 30 million years when the Smith Cloud reunites the Milky Way disk.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This title is not correct. The article states that the gas cloud could trigger the formation of **two** million new stars, not 200 million. 

Also, the [journal article](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04957) states that the cloud itself is two million times the mass of our sun, and composed of the raw material necessary to form stars. Of course, not all of it will actually be converted into stars, but a significant fraction will remain as interstellar gas after it collides with the disk of the Milky Way.

EDIT: Since this comment appears to be gaining traction, I figured I should say a little more about the [original scientific paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04957) rather than the press release because it's way more interesting (to me)! The Smith Cloud is a massive high-velocity cloud (HVC) that appears to be in a collision course with the Milky Way. 

One question that astronomers tend to ask about an HVC such as the Smith Cloud is: Did it originate from outside of our Milky Way, or was it launched from the disk of our Milky Way and is now falling back into it? If the former scenario is correct, the Smith Cloud could be a parcel of pristine gas that has been hanging around since the beginning of the universe, and only now is encountering a galaxy (aka, our Milky Way) for the first time. Or it could be a very small dwarf galaxy with an unnoticeably small stellar population. In the latter scenario, the Smith Cloud would have formed from gas expelled from the Milky Way's disk by supernovae (exploding stars); the gas then regroups outside of the galaxy via gravitational forces, accretes mass, and finally begins its return journey back into the Milky Way.

The authors of this paper believe that the latter scenario is what created this massive gas cloud. Because supernovae events change the chemical composition of the gas by increasing the abundance of heavy elements, these astronomers report measurements of the Smith Cloud's ionized sulfur content. They believe that its relatively high abundance of sulfur supports their claim that the cloud originated from gas within the Milky Way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No worries, and I hope my last comment didn't come across in any sort of a presumptuous tone! Anyway, to answer your original question, it seems like the current quasar host galaxy is still detectable and I imagine that it would be interesting to compile radio, infrared, and X-ray photometry of whatever is still emitting. Sometimes there are lags in the light curves at different wavelengths because the photons trace different media or radiative processes. </TEXT>

Also, /u/NeuralLotus, the quasar hasn't "died" but rather lost access to its inflow of accreting material. This could be due to quasar-driven outflows or feedback, or because it simply exhausted all of its accretion disk, or perhaps because of some cataclysmic event. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I study astrophysics, not particle physics. That being said, I share an office with a high energy theorist (grand unified theories/string theories) and a high energy experimentalist (CMS at CERN), and I once was interested in doing particle physics. What you'll want to do depends on whether you wish to study theory or experiment.

It also depends on what year of school you're in. By the end of your third year of undergrad, you'll want to have a solid understanding of linear algebra, classical mechanics (*Mechanics* by Landau   Lifshitz) and quantum mechanics (Sakurai). Statistical mechanics can also be helpful for learning quantum field theory, and I'd recommend checking out Griffith's *Introduction to Elementary Particles*, as /u/counterfriction mentioned, as a good "for dummies" book. I'd also recommend *Quantum Field Theory for the Gifted Amateur* by Lancaster   Blundell as a very approachable introduction to QFT. It is far easier to understand than Peskin   Schroeder or Zee, and is written by experimentalists who are very careful to explain and motivate everything they say--nothing is to be inferred in the first few chapters (and then they wean you off). *QFT for the Gifted Amateur* is probably worth self-studying your 4th year of undergrad or first year of grad, and then you'll probably spend another two semesters learning out of Peskin   Schroeder or Srednicki in graduate school. </TEXT>

Actually, now that I think about it, the top and bottom faces are each parametrized by one variable--the twist angle (which determines how far they are from the center). But... I guess this cubic structure has more symmetry and a more complex set of interactions than the double pendulum. </TEXT>

<TEXT> (Astro)physically, this picture is very interesting! Usually, globular clusters have populations of old, red stars. Blue stars are generally more massive and short lived, and a globular cluster like M5, which is 10 billion years old, should not have many blue stars. However, the oldest stars in this group have evolved to the [horizontal branch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_branch) and are quite blue indeed!

Although it's not uncommon for blue horizontal branch stars to be found in globular clusters, I didn't know this ten minutes ago (even though I'm an astrophysicist) so I wanted to share! I had thought all stars in globular clusters to be fairly red. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can try--however, I'm an astrophysicist, and not an instrumentalist, so I don't know exactly how the detectors work!

Our eyes are basically detectors. Very, very complex detectors. When we see stuff, we're just detecting intensities of light at different wavelengths. By comparing those intensities at different wavelengths, our brains can construct colors from them. So, if my eyes detect a lot of light at the blue wavelength, and detect less light at the red wavelength, I'll see blue. If my eyes detect a lot of light at the red wavelength but not at the blue wavelength, then I'll see the color red. If I see a lot of light at all wavelengths, I see white!

Okay, onto the ultraviolet (UV). Our eyes can only detect the [visible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum) part of the electromagnetic spectrum of light, but redder than red lies the infrared (IR), and more violet than violet is the UV. The Hubble Space Telescope has detectors that can measure the intensity of light in the UV, beyond what we see. In fact, it's just comparing the intensities of light at different UV wavelengths ([six different ones, in fact](http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2003/23/fastfacts/)), to create a false-color image! Since what I've called "color" is effectively a difference in intensities of light at different wavelengths, the same can be done with UV light intensities, and that's what you're seeing here.

Since people seem to want to see the highest-resolution version of the image, [here it is](http://www.spacetelescope.org/static/archives/images/screen/opo0323b.jpg). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that the article is only saying that the cosmological constant accurately describes the effects of dark energy. For example, in equation 3.39 [here](http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Peacock/Peacock3_2.html), we can see that as we approach z=0, the other density parameters have less and less of an effect (because they're inversely coupled to the scale factor). Therefore, dark energy dominates more and more, even though it is described as a constant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went into graduate school, but I've heard that undergraduate astrophysics majors can venture into software engineering, if they've learned at least some formal CS and have proved themselves versatile with programming for research, schoolwork, etc. My friend's girlfriend who studied undergraduate astrophysics also recently got a job doing freelance web design, so that path could be viable. 

If she's more interested in hands-on stuff like instrumentation, perhaps she could try applying for engineering or technician jobs. However, there don't seem to be many observatories in Washington. </TEXT>

<TEXT> LPT: Each customer in line takes as much time as 17 items (generally spent while paying).  So if you see an express register with 15 people and 10 items each, it's roughly equivalent to 405 "items" (since (17 + 10) x 15 = 405).  Therefore if there's another line with only 5 people but with 75 items each, that's about 375 "items" and you should take it.  Obviously this breaks down when people are buying big bulky items, or have a million coupons, etc.

So if you have to go through the line multiple times, it might not really be that time efficient (though I guess your anecdote suggests it worked out well). </TEXT>

In my opinion, the subjective decision to give them names is going to cause just as much confusion as the fact that some news networks will be using them, and that some won't.  

It's not a terrible idea to name them, I just wish everybody was on board in making the decision, and that there was an absolute definition to what they consider to be a "winter storm". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting, I'm pursuing particle physics but am currently in the field of astrophysics.  As you mentioned, the egregious generalizations made while doing cosmological theories are painful, especially to me, but it simply cannot be done another way.  I wish I could bust out thousands of data points--but if you've ever tried you know how hard it is to get telescope time.  So we simply work with what we have.

To address your last point: I do think that we need to carefully poke around and question everything.  But that doesn't mean that a less rigorous science isn't a science!  It may simply be that it's a more chaotic science, or a science with limited data, or anything else that we still call science.  But yes, we should be hesitant to jump onto any theory/model until it has fairly definitive results going for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Totally agree with you on (2).  

I feel like (4) is a little iffy, considering how many physicists [ignore](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2675) the formalities of math.  But I don't think any other science goes nearly as in depth in mathematics as physics does. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In fact, a slap of caffeine is what truly defines a power nap.  It does work well, but make sure you don't oversleep!  Also, I'd recommend either chugging at least 4 cups of coffee or drinking an energy drink instead of just drinking one cup of coffee.  You'll want 200mg of caffeine (or more, if you're fairly tolerant to it like me), and all the fluids + diuretics will make you really want to get up and pee when your alarm goes off--as was mentioned [before](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/xz7uy/when_you_have_to_get_up_early_in_addition_to/).

<TEXT> I've taken a basic linear algebra and self-studied matrix algebra before that. I understand the importance of linear algebra and quantum mechanics--but what about the fundamental theorem? I recall that it was extremely *elegant* and such, but I could never quite grasp the beauty of it.

If it is important, anybody care to give an explanation of why, and how it is applicable to physics?  Thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> For example, I went up to two girls to chat with them about their choice of Starbucks drinks a few days ago.

I told them, Hey I really think youre the two most interesting looking people here. I mean you even have an interesting choice of drinks there.

At this point, I ran out of things to say. I could feel that this was going to be uncomfortable but I presented an aura of calmness in my lack of certainty. I decided to tell them, See, awkwardness isnt so bad when you allow it to happen as it is without judging it as awkward. They smiled and nodded. I basked in the awkwardness comfortably and told them that it was nice meeting them. I had to get going.

I'm not really sure if I would label this "conversation" a success. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This will probably get buried, but I woke up inside a U-Haul with two passed out friends.  When I asked what was going on, he lifted an eye, muttered, "We're going to Mars," and promptly passed out again.

It turns out that while drunk, I had agreed to go help my friends buy and move a piano the next morning.  I live in Pittsburgh, PA, and we were picking up the piano in Mars, PA (about an hour away).  The piano was only $20, and we bought it from an old couple so I think they were simply trying to get rid of it without having to pay for transportation costs. </TEXT>
