<TEXT> I don't think it's that simple. The project to restore the city and the temple has already took a lot of flack from the academics. The proper excavation of the palace ruins hasn't even started, and a haphazard and rushed excavation and restoration can be a disaster that damages the integrity and authenticity of the ruins. The gigantic 19th century Gyeongbok Palace reconstruction only took 3 years to complete. The restoration of that same palace has been going on for almost three decades, and it's far from finished. There will be a lot of controversies even after the restoration regarding the accuracy of the architecture. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are a lot of interesting stories in the history, but I think the average public aren't really aware of that stuff minus a few crucial moments taught in history class. And the fact that a lot of the sites are now in ruins doesn't help. But the most critical factor that deters the average person from enjoying history is the lack of traditional culture integrated into modern life. There are some aspects of tradition, but it's hard to see that in the urban population, especially in comparison to the neighboring nations. Thankfully, I think this is changing, albeit slowly. Archaeological discoveries and restorations are being done. More pop culture works with historic backgrounds are coming out, and more people are appreciating traditional culture and embracing it in various ways. And I think Koreans who are interested in history could be found in major museums. Iksan is kinda in the boonies to be frank. Of course, this can all be just a giant speculation since I haven't asked Koreans about their opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Britain turns to South Korea to salvage Moorside nuclear project

Future of new reactor thrown in doubt by financial crisis at Toshiba
  
YESTERDAY by: Andrew Ward, Energy Editor
Greg Clark, UK business secretary, will visit Seoul this week in a bid to salvage the multibillion pound Moorside nuclear power project in Cumbria.


Moorside is an important part of Britains plans for a new generation of nuclear reactors to maintain energy security but its future has been thrown into doubt by the financial crisis at Toshiba, the Japanese group leading the Cumbrian project.

Mr Clark will meet senior South Korean government officials and nuclear industry executives to discuss potential investment in Moorside by Kepco, the state-controlled utility.


Toshiba is keen to sell its majority stake in NuGen, the consortium planning to build the Moorside power station, and Kepco is widely considered the most plausible buyer.

Saving Moorside is key not only to Britains energy policy but also to safeguard the future of nuclear power in west Cumbria, where the industry has been a big employer since the worlds first commercial reactor opened at Calder Hall in 1956.

As well as the nuclear issue, Mr Clark will use his visit to discuss trade ties with South Korea  one of Asias biggest economies  after the UK leaves the EU. In a statement confirming his trip, Mr Clark said the partnership with South Korea was a clear example of how strategic international relationships can power...a global Britain.

He highlighted biotechnology and manufacturing among other areas he would be discussing with South Korea but nuclear power is expected to top the agenda because of the urgency of attracting investors to help replace several old nuclear plants and coal-fired power stations due to be decommissioned in coming years.

Kepco confirmed last month that it was interested in joining the Moorside project as part of its efforts to become a force in the global nuclear industry. The company is building several reactors in South Korea and the United Arab Emirates but Britain would provide a bridgehead into more developed markets.

Big questions remain over the terms of potential Korean participation in Moorside  particularly whether the British government would be willing to contribute towards the estimated 10bn-15bn needed to build the plant, or at least provide credit guarantees.

Mixed signals have emerged from the Treasury and Mr Clarks Department for Business, Energy   Industrial Strategy about whether the government is willing to drop its longstanding resistance to committing public money to the expensive and risky business of building nuclear reactors.

 Another focus of discussion with Mr Clark will be whether Kepco would stick with the Westinghouse AP1000 reactors planned for Moorside or substitute its own APR1400 technology. Westinghouse, a subsidiary of Toshiba, last week filed for bankruptcy protection in the US after big cost overruns at nuclear power projects in South Carolina and Georgia.

The Koreans will want to do very thorough due diligence on what has gone wrong in the US before committing to using the AP1000, said a senior figure in the nuclear industry.

The AP1000 was last week approved for use at Moorside by the UK nuclear regulator after a decade-long review and any attempt by Kepco to replace the technology with its own APR1400 would set the project back several years. It would take NuGen back to the drawing board because all the permitting and licensing so far has been based on use of the AP1000, said an industry figure.

NuGen already has ties to Kepco through its chief executive, Tom Samson, who previously worked on the South Korean nuclear project in Abu Dhabi, which, unlike most new reactors around the world, has proceeded on time and on budget.

It is hoped that Korean involvement would help deliver a significantly lower price of electricity from Moorside than from Hinkley Point, the 18bn nuclear plant in Somerset under construction by EDF of France, which has stirred controversy for its high cost. Hinkley Point, due to open in 2025, is on course to be the first new nuclear power station in Britain since the 1990s.

South Korea's permit program swells ranks of foreign workers

Percentage of guest talent far outpaces Japan's

TOKYO -- In the competition to recruit much-needed foreign talent, South Korea's work permit program is beating that of Japan's system.

In raw numbers, Japan's 1.08 million foreign workers edge out South Korea's 960,000. But South Korea's population of 50 million is less than half of Japan's, making its proportion of foreign workers more than double that of its neighbor.

Foreign workers had entered through the Industrial Training System, which was similar to Japan's current Technical Intern Training Program. But Seoul replaced the framework with a broader Employment Permit System in 2004, which let in 480,000 nonprofessional workers.

Among that number, South Korea granted regular work permits to 260,000 people from Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, the Philippines, Indonesia and 11 other nations under bilateral agreements. They generally work in agriculture and at small to midsized manufacturers. In contrast, Japan is taking in only 210,000 technical trainees.

"The number of nonprofessional workers accepted accelerated after the introduction of the Employment Permit System," said Koji Sano, a professor at Fukushima University who is an expert on South Korean labor policy.

What sets apart foreigners working in South Korea is the sheer number who can speak the language. Some 220,000 people were recruited through the special work permit system -- among them ethnic Koreans from China as well as other foreign nationals of Korean heritage. They are found in service sectors, such as restaurants and nursing care.

Meanwhile, the language barrier prevents Japan from recruiting and retaining a significant number of talented foreigners.

On the other hand, the 210,000 foreign students in Japan who are working dwarf the 13,000 in South Korea. Furthermore, 80% of these students have joined the labor force in Japan while the same can be said for only 10% in South Korea. The 46,000 foreign-born specialists in South Korea also trail those in Japan.

<TEXT> I read a similar story regarding the Russo-Japanese War. One of the reasons the Imperial Russian Navy lost was because they lacked certain nutrients due to the months of battle far away from the European Russia. The Japanese found out that they had stocks of beans, which they could've used to solve the nutrient deficiency by cultivating bean sprouts. This could all be bullshit, but that was what I read. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 	Fake China data: was it just one province?

Revelations Liaoning fabricated statistics raise questions over rest of rust belt

Women ride past oil wells in northern China's Hebei province  AFP

4 HOURS AGO by: Lucy Hornby and Archie Zhang in Beijing and Jane Pong in Hong Kong
Sceptics about Chinaseconomic statistics have taken a special pleasure in revelations offaked data in the north-eastern province of Liaoning dating at least to 2011. Along with an officially reported contraction in its economy last year, they have given the impression that Liaonings economy is unusually troubled. That impression may be unfair to Liaoning.


In 2007 when he was party secretary of Liaoning, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang made waves when he declared Chinas gross domestic productfigures man-made.

Even president Xi Jinping weighed in on Liaonings data-faking last week, telling the provinces delegation to Chinas annual legislative meeting that the practice must be stopped.


But is Liaoning the only province to have doctored its statistics? The map below shows the share of metals and mining (a category that includes crude oil output) in the nominal gross domestic product of Chinese provinces in 2011. China stopped publishing this data in 2012, the same year the commodity cycle turned sour.


The FT examined four provinces that are more reliant than Liaoning on the coal, steel and oil industries. Shanxi, Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia comprise Chinas coal heartland; Liaoning and Hebei together account for almost one-third of Chinas steel output.

In regions where resources or steel dominate, the commodity cycle is more extreme. Booms inflate the service sector, consumer spending and property prices; busts have an outsized effect on employment and government finances. China has a rust belt just like the US or UK, says Andy Rothman, investment strategist at Matthews Asia.

Here is a look at coal, oil and steel prices since 2012.


These benchmarks were multiplied by each provinces reported output of coal, oil and steel, and charted against the reported growth in GDP. Here is Liaoning. Strangely, when it admitted to a contraction in 2016, steel, coal and oil were already recovering.


The other provinces show a similar pattern in the three key industries. Output values weakened in 2012, briefly recovered in the second half of 2013 and then took a deep dive. Here is Hebei, home to one-quarter of Chinese steel production:


The worse period was the winter of 2015-2016, followed by a recovery in 2016, as we can see in Shaanxi...


...and Inner Mongolia...


This pattern diverges from reported GDP figures, which show growth speeding up from early 2015. Heres Shanxi, the most mining-dependent of all Chinese provinces. Metals and mining (mostly coal) made up 62 per cent of its industrial output in 2011, and 37 per cent of GDP.


Did Liaoning actually underperform last year, or were its reported data suddenly brought back in line with reality? And what does that imply about the other rust-belt provinces?


 Liaoning is the most developed and diversified of the three north-eastern provinces, therefore it should have been performing better, not worse, says Andrew Batson, economist at research group Gavekal Dragonomics who keeps a close eye on the economy in Chinas beleaguerednorth-eastern provinces.

In 2013 the Communist party pledged to implement a unified system for compiling provincial GDP. Rather than relying on provincial agencies to produce GDP figures in parallel with the national survey, the pledge called for the National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing to take charge of the process.

The goal was to avoid the perennial problem of provincial GDPs summing up to a higher number than the national figure. NBS circulated a draft plan for the unified system in late 2014. Ning Jizhe, director of NBS, told official media on Sunday that phase-in will begin in 2017 and be complete by 2020.

Observers must await the release of four years of corrected data from Liaoning  if indeed the true numbers are ever divulged  if they are to find out what really happened to northern Chinas economy when the economic books were being cooked. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  When the majority of population is dumb enough to pick Park Geun He

Um. No. This come off as pretentious. I really hate this recent surge of people who are like "Man, how the fuck did we/other people elect this nutcase as a president." Situations were different back then in 2012. Park was a somewhat established figure in her party and won many elections. It is undeniable that the old voters were thinking about her father's legacy when they voted for her, but saying that she wasn't qualified whatsoever is also not true. And nobody sans a few people were aware of the shady relationship between her and the Chois. Moon wasn't an attractive candidate, too. And the margin was not big, it was 51.6% and 48.0% respectively. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  When asked Friday whether Bharara was also being asked for a resignation letter, one White House official not authorized to speak publicly said, Everybodys gone, and would not engage further on the issue. Two people close to the president said the presidents chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and Attorney General Jeff Sessions want a clean slate of federal prosecutors and are unconcerned about any perception that the White House appears to have changed its mind about Bharara. The ouster of former president Barack Obamas federal prosecutors is about asserting whos in power, these people said.

It was President Bannon's decision, what's done is done. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And of the three cultures, I'd say that the Koreans were the most keen on keeping things natural. They didn't built moats around these dwellings, and their landscape architecture and gardens received minimal intervention and maintenance. This probably has something to do with the Joeseon Dynasty, the last dynasty of the peninsula, basing their social and cultural values around Confucianism and embracing frugality. </TEXT>

This is a [folding screen] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding_screen), and although I can't say anything about the contents, the letters are highly stylized Chinese characters. Are the letters sewn into the screen, or are they handwritten? If it's the latter, then it has some resemblance to the [Buddhist sutras from Goryeo] (http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1994.207/) which also has golden letters written on indigo paper. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure about what you're talking about, but if you're talking about the dish, won't they eat it afterwards? Gotgam is a traditional snack, and this is no different from an ordinary one. But what do I know. Maybe they dump it afterwards because it was meant to be an ornament. But this is unlikely seeing as how preparing for the dish is a complicated process. Sorry for not being of any help. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I didn't think there was any part considered "downtown" in Seoul. 

What do you mean by that? Are you implying that cities outside NA and Europe don't have a downtown equivalent due to the way how they were developed differently? Or are you saying that it doesn't have the same kind of density or size found in the downtowns of NA European cities? I'm generally curious. </TEXT>

In a court filing objecting to Green Party candidate Jill Stein's Michigan recount petition, lawyers for the president wrote, "All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake."

And the current world order was made by the US. It's a intricate machine only the US can operate, and it has 70 years of experience. And the current administration will only last a maximum 8 years. Overall, the notion that China could overtake the US as the sole superpower is absurd, at least for the foreseeable future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Probably [Mt Maebong] (https://rjkoehler.smugmug.com/Travel/Maebongsan-2017/). But it's confusing as hell, because it seems like there are multiple mountains with the same name. Looks like this particular one is on the border between three districts, Seongdong, Yongsan and Jung(City Hall district) in central Seoul. To make matters worse, the alternate name of the mountain is Mt Eungbong, which happens to be the name of another mountain in Seongdong district that is lower than the aforementioned one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, because obviously your criteria for a karma whore is universally applicable. I would repost popular submissions from the past in /r/pics or /r/funny, or maybe post in nsfw subs if I was really a karma whore.  Nobody knows if their link or post will generate a lot of viewers before they actually post it. And this is not /r/politics, so the 'circlejerk' you speak of is less applicable here. Feel free to submit your own article that tells you your acceptable version of the story.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  You've either got a lot of time to waste or you're in the employ of a clikbait farm or you're mentally ill. Which is it and why? 

I can think of a billion reasons other than the ones you suggested, but for starters, maybe it was because I found an article I thought was interesting and wanted to share it with others and watch the discussion unfold. And may ask you the reason why you wish to continue this argument? Let me guess, you've either got a lot of time to waste or you're mentally ill or you're just being obnoxious. </TEXT>

Nearly 40% of Japan business chiefs down on Trump: poll

Worries over trade deals, dollar and immigration

TOKYO -- Some 37% of Japanese corporate leaders in a recent Nikkei Inc. survey said U.S. President-elect Donald Trump would have a negative impact on their business, citing uncertainty over policy under the new administration.

Just 24.7% said Trump would be a positive force. Those seeing him as bad for business were asked to choose up to three reasons. The most popular, at 72.2%, was withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership regional trade agreement.

Trump has vowed to pull the U.S. out of the TPP upon taking office, effectively scuttling the deal. Companies already making moves with the TPP in mind would be forced to rethink strategies. The next-most-popular strikes against Trump were concern over a weakening by the dollar, at 42.6%, and an exclusionary immigration policy, at 22.2%.

Of the 106 respondents with operations in the U.S., 79.2% did not expect any change to their business there. Most explained that it was unclear whether Trump could keep his promises of massive job creation and stepped-up infrastructure investment. Some thought that the American economy could improve overall but were unsure whether their own companies would benefit.

Trump has also expressed a desire to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Although 73.8% of the 61 companies with operations in the popular auto production base of Mexico expected no changes there, 19.7% did foresee a negative impact.

Back home, 64.4% of all respondents expected the Japanese economy to stay flat -- down 14.5 points from the September survey. Sluggish consumption was the top reason for this cautious outlook.

"The Japanese people are still living very defensively," said Junji Ueda, president of FamilyMart Uny Holdings. "Unless we can dispel concerns over social welfare and other issues, we won't be able to revive the economy."

Respondents were also asked to look six months down the road. The most popular response, at 48.6%, was that the economy would be growing at a moderate pace. The recent softening of the yen could bolster exports, and some companies will likely benefit from OPEC's agreement to reduce output. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm all for traditional architectural elements in modern housing, but these aren't really aesthetically pleasing. And the remaining ones are getting too old since they weren't built to last. Thankfully, more of these are being renovated, and more private housings that integrate hanok elements are being built all over the country, although it's far from the majority. </TEXT>

I knew their would be a comment like this. XD This is a version of highly stylized calligraphy of Chinese character, which is quite hard to read and write if you're not properly trained in the art, so I doubt it'll look like a penis in its standard form.
Edit: It turns out the character is [] (https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%BF%83) (pronounced 'sim' in Korean), which means heart or mind. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Looks like you've just started using reddit. My advice is that you should look carefully into the rules of the sub before submitting anything. And every sub has a topic they're not very fond of, which could be heavily downvoted. Look at what others submit and try to do something similar. And including an emoji in the title of an article you're trying to submit is mostly not allowed, afaik. Do that in a self post or a non-article link. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For some context, this is the main gate of the Deoksu Palace, which is one of the 'Five Grand Palaces' built during the Joseon Dynasty. This gate is facing the Seoul Plaza and the City Hall. The gate is one of the structures that survived the destruction of the Palace during the Japanese occupation period when two thirds of it were destroyed, but it's original location was altered to make way for a road. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Chinese was the lingua franca of East Asia for centuries, and it still is to some extent. Korea is actually the country to use the least amount of Chinese characters among East Asian nations, thanks to the development of it's indigenous alphabet 'Hangul' in the 15th century. That neon sign in the background is in Hangul, too, although it might look like Chinese because its blurry. </TEXT>
