<TEXT> No I try to see both sides to any story in wrestling. Especially when it comes to overzealous internet fans. And I do agree, it is annoying the bias that comes with certain people.

<TEXT> Just from his perspective maybe he actually wanted to plan the match out in advance rather than call it on the fly. Or that he liked to talk things over before a match, regardless of how many times they'd done it. Hell, I can respect that mindset when it comes to giving a shit about your work. Look at his work at that time (Straigh Edge Society) compared to theirs (in a title feud that felt underwhelming). I give him all the credit if he was taking himself too seriously at the time because the proof was in the pudding. He just handled it the wrong way. And what else do we know about him having a high opinion of himself? So what? Tons of people in the wrestling industry have a high opinion of themselves. You have to be selfish to be successful. I don't really fault anyone for that </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's been very outspoken about the company and what he disagrees with. He even publicly urged his friend (Titus O'Neil) to quit when he was suspended. 

My point being is that he's now at a point where his film career is successful enough that he wouldn't need to wrestle ever again if he didn't want to. That was what the company thought would happen the first time in 2010, and again in 2014. Good for him </TEXT>

It's weird because his moveset during his match at Summerslam 2015 with Cena was incredible and it's the most babyface he's ever looked. He was doing multiple dives, The Phoenix Splash, a standing shooting star press. It was incredible. I miss that Seth Rollins </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like your thinking. I can see a Braun rematch. Hell, maybe they can do some shenanigans with their first match where Braun beats him but his foot was under the rope so they restart the match or the other way around for Braun except they don't restart. Give a good reason for a rematch

I can also see Jeff being a contender due to the rumors posted a couple weeks ago. That would be awesome. Brock could throw around like a frisbee and Hardy would be **MASSIVELY** over like he is in any underdog situation. 

Another theory I have it one that I don't really have faith in its more of just wishful thinking is Angle. He's said that he's looking to get cleared so who is someone he could face where it would make sense? I think of either Brock or Triple H

He wouldn't get a single cheer. I don't know if that will be the case in New Orleans but at least it buys them more time.

It wasn't no really dragged out because they got a good solid few months of her being a indecisive face between Punk and Bryan to being a RAW GM and some solid storyline with Cena and then she went on to have one of the most solid heel runs by a Diva at first valeting for Dolph and then her title reign. And there are tons of great promos besides her promos with the Bella's. Her promo with Kaitlyn was great during their contract signing. Her promos with Punk when he was heel were great. I can't believe you don't remember all her work with Bryan. It was gold

So that will be 2 months of promos from a guy who can't speak English very well and needs to establish his character with a larger audience. Not a good idea.

<TEXT> [This] (https://www.netflix.com/title/80103395?s=i) is the business strategy it's emulating. It's not the fucking standard. I'm not arguing that. Kevin also did it for Keith's special and Amy will also be doing it for Rachel Feinstein in the future. I'm not defending it if that's what you think. I'm just explaining the benefits of it. I'm sure Normand is completely aware of that and has weighed the pros and the cons, and if he's not I'm sure his agent sat him down and explained to him that the name Amy Schumer means more in the public eye than Mark Normand. More eyes on the special means more money in everyone's pocket and Mark Normand could have a huge upside by the end of the year. Look at Lil' Rel </TEXT>

<TEXT> I bought in with Guardians of the Galaxy and Jurassic World. But after seeing him in Passengers and Magnificent Seven and watching him be the fun loving goof on TV when he's on The Tonight Show or Good Morning America it just changed my opinion. Don't hate him but it's really evident nowadays that being likable trumps talent. He's not the only actor to get away with it  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As great as they are eventually they will get Big Fish-Small Pond syndrome in that they're more interesting than their division and it's no longer compelling and you want to see them break off and do more. Hell, if there's one thing that I could criticize Neville for (even though this isn't really a critique or even his fault) it's that. Especially because he's beaten everyone and has been given a lot more as far as character development goes. Sometimes I wonder if all he needed to rejuvenate his career was just a heel turn </TEXT>

Any comic says something slightly liberal? They're labeled unfunny and called a fag and people on here pretend they were never funny (Louie, Burr, it goes on and on)

Legion of Skanks, Bonfire and CumTown aren't nearly as bad as people on here make them out to be, it's just the unspoken rule that it's the cool thing to hate on everything around here and shit on anything new brought to the table or with even the the slightest liberal agenda. It's getting old. Funny how people give Anthony and Jim shit for the exact same thing </TEXT>

<TEXT> What he means is the pay should be based on performance, work rate, and tenure. It's a fair point. Look at it through his perspective, not only did he make less guaranteed money after getting shuffled down the card, he also made less merch money (because he wasn't as prominent in the storylines, and also heels sell less merch than faces.) That stuff is largely out of a guy's control - you do the jobs they tell you to do and then your paychecks shrink because of it.

He's elaborated this more on his podcast and subsequent interviews but people just cherry pick the clips from that and act as if all he does is bitch. He doesn't. He's actually a pretty good dude who loves his fans (talks about positive faninterractions al the time), tells old backstage and on the road stories, and gives his take on current events </TEXT>

He's a positive guy who really likes his fans and he puts on a good show every week. It's also a show that goes into details on how Indy wrestling works and how lucrative (or not) that it can be. You think people on here would love that, but no, let's hate it because it's Ryaback and we have to be cool.

<TEXT> Okay, I went through my notes in my phone and I forgot that I saved it so here you go:

[The spaceship Covenant is transporting frozen embryos to a human colony on a faraway planet when they receive a distress signal from Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace), from the Prometheus expedition, which disappeared 10 years prior. The crew is brought out of hypersleep to answer to the signal, which leads to the death of the Covenant's captain, Branson (James Franco). His wife, Daniels (Katherine Waterson), is deeply affected by the accident, while Branson's first officer Archer (Billy Crudup) is made captain. The Covenant is piloted by Daniels's friend Tennessee (Danny McBride) and the crew is aided by an android, Walter (Michael Fassbender).] (#spoiler)

[The Covenant follows Shaw's signal to Paradise, an uncharted forest planet and homeworld of the Engineers, the ancient extraterrestrials that seeded life on Earth and then sought to the destroy it. The Engineers' secret weapon, the black ooze, has spread through Paradise, turning it into a wasteland. The Covenant's crew ventures outside their ship and some of its members are exposed to spores released by plants infected by the ooze. It is determined they've contracted an alien pathogen and Archer has them quarantined aboard the Covenant.] (#spoiler)

[Monstrous creatures known as "Neomorphs" burst from the infected crewmen's bodies and begin slaughtering the crew, forcing the survivors to flee into the forest, where they are rescued from the Neomorphs by David (Michael Fassbender), the sole survivor of the Prometheus crew. He reveals that Shaw sacrificed herself to crash a spaceship against Paradise's surface, exposing the Engineers to the black ooze to prevent them from destroying Earth, leaving him stranded on Paradise.] (#spoiler)

[David leads the survivors back to the Engineers' derelict citadel, where he's been living ever since. Walter mistrusts David, who is not behaving in accordance with their programming, and finds out that David in fact murdered Shaw. David's mind has been warped by the numerous modifications that his creator, Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), made to his programming during the Prometheus's expedition, and is obsessed with creating the "perfect organism". He exposed numerous lifeforms on Paradise, including Shaw, to the black ooze and, after numerous failed attempts, has created an alien egg, which produces a facehugger that latches itself to Archer, leading to the birth of a Primal Xenomorph.] (#spoiler)

[Daniels and Tennessee realize David is controlling the Neomorphs and escape back to the Covenant with Walter in order to leave Paradise. Together, Daniels and Tennessee manage to kill the Primal Xenomorph and the Neomorphs and detonate explosives to destroy David's laboratory, with David himself apparently perishing in the explosion.] (#spoiler)

[After escaping, Daniels and Tennessee place themselves back in hypersleep to continue their voyage to the colony, unaware that David has killed Walter and stolen his identity to leave Paradise. David secretly plants two alien egg embryos among the human frozen embryos that the Covenant is transporting to proceed to the next phase of his experiment.] (#spoiler)

[Possibly the next movie will show how engineers were not THE benevolant higher power beings we wanted them to be,they were just a race being pawns of another higher race or higher power but stronger and a lot more advanced within the same race.The engineers we see in lv 223 and 426 are not the same we will see in covenant. The covenant ones are not as advanced...they are like a "primal indigenous" version of the true engineers who mastered the black goo chemical,this engineers are evil and the next sequels will cover more about them and what the black goo is trully capable of,i heard the idea we will follow is that the xenomorph as we know it was never the ultimate organism just one of the variations of the very first "creature" the chemical was made off, at this moment we see the xeno as the big bad beast(queen mostly) but i believe we will have another one to worship as the true perfect organisms.] (#spoiler)

<TEXT> I didn't mind it. The difference between Braun and Corbin is that they've given Corbin a few losses and he's bounced back. Not to say that Braun hasn't with his one against Roman but Barron they seem to give more nuance to his character with his losses. He's only lost to 3 top guys. One was clean (Cena), one was dirty (Orton, and I feel that that was done to protect a possible title feud down the line), and the latest one was clean (Dean), but this was more of a case of losing the battle but winning the war.

I also have a feeling that Corbin will be Cena's return feud.

As great as they've handled Braun, his purpose is to ultimately put over Roman. And the writing has been on the wall since the brand split. Whether he makes it or breaks it after that is comeplety on the writing team, but the guy has proved he had staying power over the past 6 months. I hope they don't give him the usual giant treatment </TEXT>

HBK could make a broom look good. The only one who I can say that I'm a fan of on the mic and in the ring and I do think has that spark that interests me and has put in work is Charlotte. But a lot of that is because she's been given the most and protected more than the other 3.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For me it's Wrestlemania 23. I think it has a great main event (Cena/HBK), but that's all the card really does for me. It's biggest praise is Taker vs Batista which many say stole the show but I disagree. Taker has had far better matches than that and Batista and him definitley had way better matches than the one in Detroit.

I also don't think the undercard is very good. The Money in the Bank match was fun and stacked with Main Event talent that deserved more for Mania than the Money in the Bank. Kane/Khali was a bore fest. Benoit and MVP had a good match but they had even better matches down the line. The ECW snooze fest

They had to take 40 minutes of the show to devote it to Trump/McMahon which was fine and all but so much more could be been done with other wrestlers (about 80% of the guys in Money in the Bank).

It just doesn't hold up to me. Not that good of a Mania </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not arguing the booking of the match. Or the match's purpose. It's piss poor, but I do believe what I've stated. Hunter needed the win more than Sting. And in today's day and age I need a better reason for a part timer to go over than "not lose his only WM match" as shitty as that sounds. It's a business, not a fairy tale. At least Hunter and Brock's wins seem to have purpose that serves the future

And I thought that the handshake was done purely so they could brag about a Wrestlemania moment. As in look as these two legends break kayfabe so they can put the past in the past. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because a match featuring two part time guys does nothing to establish future stars. All it does is cement two part-timers legacy. Making their appeal greater when facing younger guys so when they do and the younger guy goes over the younger guy also looks better. Hunter is on TV more and he's basically the WWE's number one bad guy. A win services him more because he can use it to look better and put over the younger talent </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hunter needs to get a win every once in awhile in order to make sure that when he loses it actually means something. I'll take him going over a 58 year-old legend who doesn't have a lot left to offer in the ring so that he can put over 3 younger guys (Bryan, Roman, Rollins) so he can establish the future. That's always been my view on him beating Sting. Didn't bother me in the least </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bobby is a nice guy. That's all I can say about it and defend what he does. He doesn't want to join in and gang up on someone he is friendly with despite what they're doing is shitty. Look at it like this, Bobby is the type of person who if you were his friend and were accused of something shitty he would be the only one defending you even if the verdict was pretty damning. He's a good dude. Don't judge him by this clip, because there's been countless other times that he's gone out on a limb to speak his mind on what everyone has been thinking but no one is saying. He's gone on Hillary rants, he's gone off on the female comic Facebook group, he was one of the first people who came forward and defended Anthony even though he had shit on the line with his pilot. He's a good guy and I'll always defend him. Fuck, he even had some asshole from here on the podcast so they could talk about what's wrong with the show and why people criticize it and he made sure that comics on the show didn't gang up on him. Who does that? Bobby's one of the most likable people associated with the show and I'll always defend him.

This blows me away about Christi. I liked her, but I never thought she was this malicious. The entitlement is insane

<TEXT> Look I try to defend this show as much as I can because I do enjoy it, but this past month has been unbearable with that shit. **EVERY FUCKING WEEK** we've gotten some MMA bore or some WWE star. Fighters are the most boring egotistical listens ever. It's the same shit. They can't laugh at themselves. They have no sense of humor. They stink. A good example is I can't stand Mickey Gall when he's on LOS. They basically lick his ass the whole hour and a half and he stinks for the same reasons I listed above.

WWE wrestlers could be interesting in some regards because they can be entertaining, but everyone in that fucking company is so beaten to death with media training and everything they say publicly is so managed and contrived that it's just all terrible. I don't get it.

They're being dishonest when they say they aren't trying to appeal to a niche with their respective podcasts. I wish they would just own up to that. I respect that they took the call and they (especially Jim) didn't talk over him. Good caller, too

Edit: Changed day to week because I'm an over-exaggerating coward </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember Meltzer reporting on this. Apparently he flipped a table backstage and almost hit Mark Carrano. You're right on the reasons he was pissed. I think this was also a way to protect their top guy (Cena) but they were also testing Lesnar to see if he'd walk early from his deal if he was truly upset. God knows he didn't need the money at that point. But he didn't  </TEXT>

I wonder in Mauro's case if it's 100% JBL. Could it also be Vince/Hunter/Dunn berating him on the headset every week? What goes down backstage? Mauro's take is what I'm most interest in because it's the most current. He probably isn't going to comment though </TEXT>

2009 had my favorite iteration of Smackdown ever (Jeff Hardy, Edge, CM Punk, Chris Jericho, Rey, Morrison, Shelton) just an incredible roster

2010 had a good feud with Batista/Cena, Orton was on fire as a babyface, The Nexus Angle, The Taker/HBK match

There are good points in every year </TEXT>

He squashed Ellsworth because Ellsworth is booked as a joke who got lucky for 2 months against AJ. It was how you vehemently put a period on the end of that feud. It maintained AJ's credibilty. He hasn't been booked as someone who fucks people up. He's booked as a fantastic performer. The only thing that could back up your claim would be him attacking Shane in the parking lot but in that he was made to look like a coward who had to jump Shane from behind </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Bill wakes up to his ceilling dripping and he then gets up to go get a bucket. While he's in the hallway he sees George's room is open with muddy footprints leading downstairs and into the cellar. After calling for his parents who don't answer he decides to go investigate. He slowly descends into the **slightly flooded** cellar not noticing the door shutting behind him by itself. He sees George who blames him for his death and invites him to "float too" (like the trailer). It is during this that you see Pennywise slink up from the water, revealing himself, and then you realize that his hand is behind George using him as a puppet. Really weird disturbing visual. Pennywise than chases Bill upstairs. Bill makes it to his room, locks the door and then lays in his bed terrified as his door jiggles, after awhile he goes to the door with his bat only to open it and fight out it's his father who heard him screaming. They investigate the basement but find out its no longer flooded and there is no trace of George or Pennywise.] (#spoiler) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's in my top 5 Mania matches of all time. The story is incredible. There is literally like 6 wrestling moves used the whole match but they told a tremendous story. And it has to be one of the best matches from a booking standpoint in a long time when you look at all who were involved (Roman, Brock, Seth) and where they went from that night.

I loved the build too. I remember Heyman said in an interview that they were going for an old school boxing feel to this whole match. I also loved the red lighting they used over the crowd

<TEXT> You're definitley right, but a good refreshening will only help it. The roster is small enough that a lot of guys were utilized well but a good chunk seem like they've done all they can do on that show (Becky and AJ are my examples). New people will be very welcome

A smaller roster means wrestlers will get more attention, but it also means that the show can't maintain original storylines for a year. This superstar shakeup is a great idea </TEXT>

<TEXT> Negate was a poor choice of word. I guess what I mean is that it don't see Goldberg's win as a definitive he's better than Brock, more of he got lucky. I think we'll see the ultimate sleighing of Brock when someone (most likely Roman) has a 20 minutes match with him and pins him clean. That will be decisive and is still thenulitlmate rub here </TEXT>

<TEXT> The way I took the Rumble spot was that Goldberg was in Brock's head and had the mental edge over him. There's continuity there. At Survivor Series, Brock strong-armed Goldberg into the counter (his only offense) only to have Goldberg completely surprise him with a vicious shove, flooring him. 

At the Rumble, Brock just abandons all thought and mindlessly goes after Goldberg and gets speared and dumped out of the ring.

<TEXT> - They take him serious because he's a very good wrestler who also is a bad guy. Look at how he won the title the first time. 

- You're saying he didn't take Taker to the limit by kicking out of Taker's offense and using weapon shots and low blows in a **Hell in a Cell** match?

- How is it disgusting? They're both part time authority figures/wrestlers who come back to put talent over? That's my comparison. Not their wrestling

- You're criticism of him the Survivor Series is also the same point I'm making in how he'll look strong

This is all my opinion. It's okay to have different opinions

<TEXT> Because he's someone who took the Undertaker to his limits last year so much that they had Undertaker show him respect on Smackdown back in November. That shows a little investment by them in that they'd have Taker put him over. He's someone they can pull out every now and then to build a solid feud with someone. Very much like Triple H. They book him strongly because his character is basically this resilient risk taker that will kill himself if it accomplishes his goal. Not saying I agree but look at the past year.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's my hope too that he can tough it out for one more year. But I think that that match was the plan for this year with Taker doing that Smackdown promo before Survivor Series saying that he was 'home'. I'm guessing at some point Taker realized that he just can't do it anymore and plans changed. They've never brought up the fact that he declared he'd stay on Smackdown. 

I'm guessing Vince weighed his options and was like two matches: Taker vs Cena and Taker vs Roman. And he went with the one that serves the future more. I can't argue with that </TEXT>

Yeah Roman will get booed, but he'll leave and Taker will have his moment with the fans to close the show. There's my optimism  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a miserable job. Ryback made a very good defense for them on his podcast by saying imagine if you were a painter and you spent God knows how long on your art. Day in day out you crafted what in your mind was a masterpiece and you went to you boss and he said "nah, I don't like that". So you went back and you made some adjustments and he still was unreceptive and wanted you to change it. Eventually after going back and forth so many times you would just start drawing stick figures and after awhile you would become complacent. Then add in the fact that you have to travel all the time, deal with wrestlers who can be difficult to work with, and then having to fly to Stanford to have meetings at 12 o'clock at night because Vince has to get a 4 hour workout in. And on top of everything be hated by 99% of wrestling fans and blamed for everything that's bad with the current product and never praised when something hits. Who wouldn't hate that? I don't know how people do it </TEXT>

<TEXT> Prediction: AJ will win this Sunday, but due to either a small package (to emphasize that he's a better wrestler) or by cheating and using a weapon against Shane. The AJ fans seem to forget that he's a heel whenever you discuss this match with them and don't want to accept that they need to find a way to keep heat on him going forward while still making Shane look strong.

Yes, believe it or not, they will want to keep the guy who is known as the ultimate risk taker and someone who took Taker to the limit last year (so much that Taker showed him respect, something he rarely does) looking strong for when they use him again </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do people actually believe that all seven members of The Nexus were destined for superstardom or something? Let's have a look at the group:

- Wade ended up doing pretty well for himself despite visa + injury issues plaguing his career; was a relevant player for a decent amount of time. He got to remain relevant after the supposed burial, going into a full-blown feud with Cena after Summerslam. He certainly wasn't ruined by the result of the Summerslam match, but rather he was 'ruined' by bad luck with timing and injuries that came long after The Nexus was dead.

- Heath Slater went from a ginger with long hair and nothing else particularly interesting about himself... to being repackaged in such a way that he was able to actually develop a personality as the OMB (after TMB, of course). Getting Heath away from Nexus was the best thing that could have happened to him.

- Skip Sheffield went from a mediocre power wrestler that didn't cut a particularly good promo and wasn't particularly exciting... to being repackaged as Ryback and having himself a pretty decent top level run. Getting Ryback away from Nexus was the best thing that could have happened to him.

- Justin Gabriel was a vanilla pretty boy that didn't have much more than a 450 splash going for him. In The Nexcus, Justin Gabriel was a guy that got his one cool spot per show, and that was about it. It's hard to argue that he had a superstar career ruined by the Summerslam result.

- Michael Tarver was legitimately a terrible worker and terrible promo, and should have been kept in developmental for a lot longer. His release was pretty unsurprising, as he wasn't particularly good at anything other than wearing a bandana over his face. Nexus was going to easily be the high point of his career... so you could probably argue that the Summerslam loss killed his otherwise-poor career.

- David Otunga was legitimately a terrible worker and marginal promo, and probably would have been released years ago if not for his relationship with Jennifer Hudson. Otunga actually got better after the Nexus loss at Summerslam, as he began to open up his personality (with some very erotic Cena segments...)

- Darren Young was just another guy in Nexus, and so Summerslam didn't really ruin his projected career path whatsoever.


What people don't remember about the Nexus is that it was essentially a vehicle for Wade Barrett to get a main event run; it wasn't about elevating seven guys at once. Wade was the only one that was supposed to get a rub out of the Nexus, and it allowed him to work a four-month program with the top star in the company.

In reality, The Nexus did exactly what The Nexus was supposed to do. If anything ruined The Nexus, it was when CM Punk took over the group and then Wade went to SmackDown for the shitty retread of The Corre. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Brock has sold the shit out of this feud with his facial expressions alone. That shove at Survivor Series and his 'what the fuck look' after was amazing and when he got eliminated from The Rumble and looked like he was going to cry, epic. He's really done an awesome job as the bully who's been on top for so long that they're in utter shock when someone bigger comes to the playground. I think he snaps Sunday and just destroys an old man who got lucky a couple of times </TEXT>

<TEXT> What he means is the pay should be based on performance, work rate, and tenure. It's a fair point. Look at it through his perspective, not only did he make less guaranteed money after getting shuffled down the card, he also made less merch money (because he wasn't as prominent in the storylines, and also heels sell less merch than faces.) That stuff is largely out of a guy's control - you do the jobs they tell you to do and then your paychecks shrink because of it.

He's elaborated this more on his podcast but people just cherry pick the clips from that and act as if all he does is bitch. He doesn't. He's actually a pretty good dude who loves his fans (talks about positive faninterractions al the time), tells old backstage and on the road stories, and gives his take on current events </TEXT>

<TEXT> My prediction: AJ will win this Sunday, but due to either a small package (to emphasize that he's a better wrestler) or by cheating and using a weapon against Shane. The AJ fans seem to forget that he's a heel whenever you discuss this match with them and don't want to accept that they need to find a way to keep heat on him going forward while still making Shane look strong. 

Yes, believe it or not, they will want to keep the guy who is known as the ultimate risk taker and someone who took Taker to the limit last year (so much that Taker showed him respect, something he rarely does) looking strong for when they use him again </TEXT>

<TEXT> To make a special attraction? Yeah. I get what you're saying. But I like that he wrestles sparingly. It feels like a big fight when he finally does. I don't want to see that end. It's what made this match so awesome 

He also wrestled a fair number of house shows. Definitley more than 3. During the lead up to Mania last year he was wrestling the League of Nations quite a bit every other weekend for a stretch  </TEXT>

He gets to do that as little as he wants for the most money he can get. Who wouldn't  want that? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Just rewatched One Night Stand 2008 and noticed a cool subtle detail during Batista and HBK's Stretcher Match </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-27 06:30:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> During the match whenever Batista looked like he had Shawn beat,  Jericho would come out and try to cheer on Shawn. And all it would do wasn't make Batista inflict more punishment on him. 

The first time he comes out was after Batista lays him out with a Batista Bomb. All this does is just make Batista hit him with another one.

The second time is when Batista all but has the match won as he's dragging a damn near lifeless HBK on the stretchers over the line, and Jericho come and out again only to stop Batista but more so cheer Shawn on again. This only pisses Dave off, who the new proceeds to grab the steel steps and proceed to spinebuster HBK on them, incapacitating him and winning the match.

When I was younger and watched this live I thought Jericho's role in this match was so awkward and weird as he didn't deliberately interfere. Now I realize that this match took place a week before the infamous heel turn when Jericho through Shawn through the Jeri-tron. **Jericho is passive-aggressively goading Batista into hurting Shawn a lot more than he needs too.** I don't know if I'm reading too much into this or just late to the party. But this is pretty masterful storytelling and a great and rare example of foreshadowing in wrestling </TEXT>

<TITLE> Kevin Owens on the ROH 'T-Shirt Incident' with CM Punk </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-06 03:36:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Kevin Steen**: In April, I wrestled Vordell Walker and that was the T-Shirt Incident night, so that night was terrifying. A week before the show I asked you, can I just wrestle in my t-shirt, I dont feel comfortable without it. People werent exactly blown away with my Ring of Honor run so far. [] This is where I suspect you had to [have told] CM Punk that I asked you about wrestling in a t-shirt.

That afternoon, as soon as I got there, Punk made a comment to me about wrestling in a t-shirt. I was like, well I guess that got back to him somehow. And then, I had a terrible match with Vordell Walker. Just fucking abysmal. I came to the back and I dont know, I made this snide comment to Punk about my t-shirt and he lost it on me. You didnt see any of this?

**Gabe Sapolsky**: I didnt see any of this.


**Kevin Steen**: Anyway, I came to the back and I was blown [up]. Punk was just there watching me. And I dont know why but [I was like] Are you happy now?, but I was just joking around with him. He did not take it as a joke. He just stood up and I remember this, I remember he stood up and he looked around and I knew what he was going to do. We had this weird momentI was like please dont do it and hes like 'no no, I have to. So it was like weird, like he was warning me. It was like he was telling me this is a show.

He goes, nope I have toWHO THE FUCK and he just starts screaming at me in the locker room and everybody turns to look at me. And I was like what do I do now? 


**Gabe Sapolsky**: You should have punched him in the face dude.

**Kevin Steen**: Dude, I thought about shoving him as hard as I could. [] But at that point I wanted to be [in Ring of Honor] so bad and hes really making me look like an asshole. I could see weight equipment all around us. I could see a bench press right behindif I had shoved him, he would have taken a bump. Thats the thing, I was like 'do I just fucking shove this guy? and I was like, I cant do that. Also I was friends with Colt [Cabana], kind of, at that point. Then I saw Homicide with his t-shirt [on] right there and I felt like going, 'yell at him too. Both choices would have been horrible.

So I just went, Ok. Youre right, Im sorry, and that was it. I completely bitched out. Completely.

<DATE> 2017-01-21 03:55:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For those who care this is a little trick I use to get a more authentic pinning animation for the Styles Clash. I hit the move but I don't use the pin combo. I use the Wrist Clutch Lever Pull pinning combo because it's an Grounded-Upper Body grapple and it looks a lot closer to the way he pins after using the Styles Clash in real life </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've listened to his podcast where he and his LA writing friend sit and talk about horror movies and you get a good senses of Joe's horrible taste 


- Thinks Batman vs Superman is the best version of Batman ever. Thinks the DC movies are all 10/10. Called Suicide Squad a "masterpiece"

- Hates The Sopranos.

- Can't finish the move 'Happiness' because Phillip Seymour Hoffman cums while talking to a chick on the phone. Is 'disgusted' by it and most of Todd Solondz work.

- Hates the movie Drive because it takes "All the likability away from Albert Brooks". Yes, you heard that right, he hates a movie because an actor did his job really well.

- Hates Terminator 2, for unspecified reasons.

- Thinks Kingpin is the "Greatest comedy of all time" I love Kingpin and think it's one of the most underrated comedies ever, but 'all time'?

- Enjoys Sex   The City.

- Thought The Nightmare on Elm Street remake was amazing.

- Thinks Mary Steenburgen is the hottest woman alive.

- Thinks Fargo is the worst Coen Brothers movie.

- Thinks the Star Wars prequels are just as good as the originals. Literally won't hear ANY criticism when it comes to Star Wars

- Halloween 2 is better than the original (John Carpenter).

- "My Blue Heaven is a wonderful movie."

- Hellraiser 2 is the greatest horror film of all time.

- Hates Dumb   Dumber.

- Sided with Jada Pinkett and the whole Oscar's controversy. 

- Thinks The Watch (2012) was a great comedy.

- Hates Aliens and thinks it's the most overrated movie of all time

He went on the say that Anthony is one of the funniest people on radio but he (Nick) always rolls his eyes whenever he's on Anthony's show riffing with him and how Anthony always has to pump the brakes on the humor with "but, folks" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry for such a selfish post, but after seeing Rogue One (which I loved) I'm excited to see where they go from here. Does anyone know or have there been any inside articles with the scoop? I've heard rumors about an Obi Wan movie where they bring back Ewan McGregor (best part of the prequels). Didn't the guy who directed Fantastic Four (2015) get fired from directing this one? I've also heard about it being a Boba Fett movie. 

This is wishful thinking but I think it would be cool to see a solo Vader movie in which you could bring back Ian McDiarmid (was really bummed that he wasn't in Rogue One). Anyone else? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A lot of the buildup was screwed because of Roman being suspended, basically making it Seth vs Dean for a month (because they didn't want to put any more attention on Reigns if they didn't have to). 

The match was fine, very fun. But it just seems it could have been more. Making it a brand rivalry feud with the GM's sitting ringside was very distracting. And I didn't like that it ended and then off to their respective shows they go. 

I hope they revisit it again in hen future. With better build </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm relistening to an old show where it's Jim's birthday so naturally he has celebrities that he's a fan of (Ozzy, Michael K Williams, Bob Saget) awkwardly call and wish him happy birthday while also conveniently having something to plug. It's fucking enraging. The only silver lining is that it's an episode Louie is on so he's just trashing Vos and Jim

Louie (2006 - 2011) was the greatest </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ever since Lesnar resigned, I've seen so many people on here put this as one of their dream matches. Hell, I remember being certain two years ago when Cena and Orton were feuding for a shot at Brock and the title that it would be Orton.

It just sucks. That segment where Orton hit the RKO on Lesnar and the place went INSANE. My favorite moment of this year. The whole feud basically seems like a dirty welcome mat for a Shane/Lesnar program. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Remember how awesome Summer 2013 was? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-15 18:20:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It is very rare that things work for WWE for a consistent amount of time, but can you guy think of anything that sucked that summer? I can think of so many programs that made tuning in every week fun.

- The Rise of Daniel Bryan: watching Daniel Bryan go on a quest to not be the "weak link" and prove everyone that he can win the big one to go on and beat Cena at Summerslam was awesome to be apart of.

- The Best vs The Beast: the feud between Heyman and Punk that lead to (in my opinion) the match of 2013 at Summerslam, Lesnar vs Punk.

- The Shield: Every week these 3 guys were putting on match of the night with a random threesome of main eventers. It was so awesome to watch these guys make names for themselves.

- Mark Henry's "Retirement": remember that amazing promo by Henry where he played us all for fools?

- Christian gets one more shot: Christian had a underrated title match at Summerslam with Del Rio. Given that his career seems to be over I look back fondly at this match because it was very underlooked on a stacked card and proved that despite how random it seemed it still stood out on a pretty stacked card.

- The Double Turn: that awesome match at Payback where a face Del Rio turned heel and Ziggler turned face.

- The Return of RVD

- AJ vs Kaitlyn: these two tore the house down for the divas division that summer, they even gahs a very good contract signing segment on Smackdown.

- The Wyatt Family: the debut of the mysterious Wyatt Family. The feud with a Kane may have been a little lackluster, but Bray's promos created enough mystique to keep me interested.


Did I miss anything? What do you guys think? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Ron. I think he's a great conversationalist, a tremendous interviewer and quick as a whip. I just get annoyed at the people who wash his balls and can't stand to hear any criticism of him. Him and Opie are very similar in certain ways. 

- Both are never the butt of the joke.
- They surround themselves with Yes men who rarely/almost never challenge them on anything. 
- Both believe and act like they are tougher than they actually are.
- Bobby gets shit on daily for his weight yet Ron is just as if not more obese and never gets anything.

Yes, I know Ron is funnier than Opie. It just annoys me that they are cut from the same "ship steerer should never look vulnerable" cloth </TEXT>

<TITLE> Car temperature gauge is fluctuating </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hello! I have a 2005 Chrysler Sebring and I just recently got the water pump replaced. I got it replaced because the temperature gauge had been fluctuating before and it's what my mechanic told me was the problem. After getting it fixed a couple of weeks ago I'm still noticing it fluctuating from under the middle line to the middle line and yesterday when I was sitting in my car after driving it for about a half hour and I was in traffic I noticed it starting to creep over the middle a little. Luckily, I was able to pull over and turn it off for awhile and it was fine, but it's still fluctuating when I drive. It never overheats though. So what exactly is the problem here?  </TEXT>

I just moved to a new city and am starting to hit up the bar scene, which for so long has been very foreign to me. I don't really know how to approach women and if they're into me and part of it is with being confused on how I look in terms of attractiveness and style. Any input would greatly be appreciated at this point. Thanks </TEXT>

I'm just wondering how I rate now compared to when I was overweight and what I can still change about myself.

Do women find weight loss attractive? Or off putting because of what the person used to be? How is my style now (fashion, haircut,etc.)

Thank you very much! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Someone on IMDB put it so well for people who are criticizing the film

Original thread: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4263482/board/thread/254016144
 
Here is the post in quotes 

"What does the title card say? "A New England Folktale". It's not meant to be ambiguous or complicated. Think of it like you're being told a story at bedtime or in a classroom. The movie has a very straightforward lesson. 

What's the first scene in the movie? William think he's better and more pious than the village counsel, and says he's happy to be banished. This leads directly to his baby being kidnapped. He ignores this and ignores that his wife is beside herself with misery because of his actions. 

The movie is mostly a catalogue of his lies and hypocrisy and how his poor example spreads to the rest of the family. He lies constantly, about the cup, about hunting, and encourages also his son to lie, even as he tells him to memorize how his soul is riven with sin. Even his baby is filled with sin, in his mind, yet the sin we witness is his constant hypocrisy. 

Things spiral out of control. The children accuse each other, but only because they've learned how to lie for their own safety when convenient, and out of a sense of real danger that their parents will harm them if they're found to be consorting with the devil. They're right to turn on each other! It's only natural in a house as mad as this. 

The father dies, killed by Black Phillip. Why does he accept his death? "Corruption, thou art my father". 

And so Thomasine, left with nothing, turns to the only source of authority and shelter left to her: the evil present in the house. But they had every chance to turn away from evil, to scorn hypocrisy. They didn't. 

So what's the moral of the story? False piety is no substitute for moral substance. Very straightforward, very unambiguous." </TEXT>

Not only physically but he taps into that insecurity with this addict/advice shit because he thinks it makes him come off wise an enlightened but I've only found it to make him more close minded and shallow. For all his self deprication, it's all bullshit. I think that's what having money and moderate success does to people who are able to bag women out of their league. It's not healthy.

I mean, he also believes that deep down people are exactly like him sexually. Just weird and fucking perverted to an almost perverted degree and that's what guise he takes as "real".

It's pitiable really. He's just an empty vessel walking around NYC and doing the road on the weekend. Never knowing what affection or happiness is but he LOATHES the mentally ill </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Before   After] (http://m.imgur.com/a/IgyTU)

I posted in r/loseit but I thought I would come here and share my story because I love hearing and seeing everyone's stories about being healthy and losing weight.

Mine basically started with the fact that I have depression. Which is something that I've always had to deal with and always will. But around the end of 2014 I had just turned 21 and I realized that I can't change the way that I feel but a lot of the reasons that I feel so shitty is because I'm overweight.

I hated how I couldn't fit into any stylish clothes, just sweats and 2xl t-shirts from Walmart. I know that that sounds vain and conceited but I literally have a closet full of shit that I couldn't fit into anymore. I hated how I couldn't go outside. One of those pics I'm in is when I was in Hawaii and I was MISERABLE the whole time and barely left the hotel room. I hated how food was my only comfort and realized that that's not a very healthy way to live life.

Around Christmans time I decide to change with baby steps. I cut out things in my diet that were unhealthy but I know I wouldn't miss. For instance I never had had much of a sweet tooth so sugar was the first thing to go. And then I cut out alcohol. Within the first month I lost 25-30 pounds right there. Then I cut out red meat, which did WONDERS for my energy. I also started walking EVERYWHERE. Work/school/shopping, and after I stereo losing weigh those walks turned into power walks which turned into jogs which turned into slow runs, you get the picture. After about half way through the year I started taking up a ton of combat sports such as boxing, kick boxing and jiu jitsu. I've always loved MMA and it's amazing what all of those (boxing especially) did for my muscle and weight loss. Really toned up my shoulders as well.

I started to use my NutriBullet and adding Kale to my diet. I hated it at first but when you blend it with fruit and other things you don't notice it and it's so good for you.

Just baby steps. Losing weight got really fun towards the end and it was nice to go outside with out a shirt on.

<TEXT> I'm listening to his podcast The Moment (the one where Jay cried) but he's such a pompous douchebag. He constantly has to interrupt Dan and Jay to correct the tiniest thing the day wrong. They talked about Jay's incident at the Comic Strip and he says that he didn't agree with William calling that drunk chick a cunt. He's one of those assholes who all the comics are nice to because they want a guest spot on Billions. What a pretentious dickhead </TEXT>

He's a very nice guy. Good to his fans. Funny. Takes his beatings well. I don't want the dude to die </TEXT>

<TITLE> Do we all agree that this has been a GREAT year for film???? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I just got back from seeing Room, and WOW. Amazing film. I haven't cried during a film for so long and I did it twice in this film within 5 minutes of each scene. And I'm walking back to my car and I realize that this has been such a good year for film. Some of my favorites that stand out:

1) Mad Max: Fury Road was a poweful movie and was just so beautiful film to look at. 

2) Sicario: amazing cinematography. And heart wrenching tension. Incredibly cynical and dark with a very realistic ending that stuck with me.

3) Steve Jobs: literally an action film with words. Great performances and it bums me out that it bombed at the box office. 

4) The Martian: A fun film that I enjoyed with my grandfather. It's fun to see a film and enjoy it because of someone else's experience.

5) Inside Out: like I said with my Grandpa, I saw this with my neices and it was fun to see it through their eyes. It's cool to see kids find a movie like Toy Story was to me.

6) Room: I know I praised it already but this film is incredible. It's a movie that I know I'll be thinking about in a week and it just touched me on another level. Brie Larson better win an Oscar. Go see it. It's my favorite film so far this year

Watching previews and it amazes me that with a month and a half left of the year we still have a TON of promosing films to be released or that I haven't seen yet (The Revenant, The H8teful Eight, Joy, Concussion, The Danish Girl). And of course probably the highlight for the world in terms of film and 2015.

Star Wars

What are your guys thoughts???

<TEXT> I'm listening to a Nopie show and the boys were discussing the Civil War/Lincoln and this hilarious quip was uttered.

Jim: "There were rumors that The Confederacy was sending delegates to meet with Lincoln to negotiate ending the war early so slavery could still stay intact, but because it took them so long to ride North, Lincoln had enough time to reconsider his decision and decided to initiate The Emancipation Proclamation before ending the war."

Anthony: "Really? If I had a time machine I'd go back with a Ferrari and pick them up." </TEXT>
