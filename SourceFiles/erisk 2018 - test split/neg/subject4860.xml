<TEXT> May not be exactly related to this case, but I hate those parents who blame their chidrens fault to Apple and Google. I remember reading about a parent who wanted a refund for the apps his or her child bought, and the child knew the password of the account.

So, the parent
1. Let the child use his or her phone
2. Did not warn about making purchases
3. Let the child know the password of his or her account
And then blamed Google or Apple for letting apps "luring" children to pay for apps.

Thanks to that kind of parents, now I have to type password often to buy something on a phone when I have no children at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> " Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is urging for companies to take a considerate approach. "

The job of companies is to make a profit. As long as that is tied to consumer service. I have no problem.
Chances are I'm not going to support and buy a lousy product just because the CEO wants to be nice to people.

ALL technology has replaced jobs (old technology) for others with a long term gain in jobs being a historical fact. The idea companies have to go around dedicating themseleves to keeping jobs that exist to implement technology is self-defeating and is not providing consumers who want that technology with their needs </TEXT>

<TEXT> China is illegally laying claim on a large part of North-Eastern state and along Northern border with India, which is conventionally and historically well demarcated. Significantly they are not ready to settle the border issue ever and keep it pending for so that land hungry China may lay claim on more areas in future, besides what they are occupying in PoK, gifted to them by their friend Pakistan. Ironically China don't recognize the Mc Mohan line of border demarcation settled by the British Indian government. But they recognize the dotted line of their border on the water bed of South China Sea. </TEXT>
