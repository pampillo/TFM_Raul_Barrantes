<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My grandfather framed and hung the first dollar he made as an air-condition repairman.  Hed spent days working at a paper processing plant and nights studying to become an air-condition repairman. Reflecting on my grandfathers dedication is what brought me to his old hunting camp down in the deep-south: I came with a stack of texts for my licensure exam and my hunting gear; I hoped that the memory of my grandfathers dedication to his dream would carry me through the rest of my prep for the exam.

I left the books at the desk beneath that framed bill and went to get my gear setup. On the way out I peeked into the old boathouse, recalling that one time Id seen a water moccasin slithering around the dock in there. A smile touched my face. Once Id crossed the last threshold  hows that for a nickname; the guys that had been through the exam called it the last threshold, but then again, Im the one whod had my practitioners gear etched with scripture speaking of truth and the way of things  Id be able to settle down, build a nice set of memories to serve as a shield against the unpleasant aspects of my career.

The old game trail snaking around the boathouse brought me into a tangled grove of oaks, cypresses, and cattails. Branches thick with moss and creepers fragmented the noon sun into diffuse lances of light. The scents of the marsh mingled with the croak of frogs, the hiss of something slithering in the underbrush to lull my mind into a state of relaxation. I flexed my fingers, limbering them up along the way to the deer stand.

My jitters worsened with each step toward the deerstand. I had to squint against the background to pick it out: draped with foliage that blended with its camouflaged pattern to conceal it from my nights game. I had hunted plenty of dangerous game in the past  the wild boar Id gone after with my uncle had been the worse; those ugly sons of bitches were mean as hell when you pissed them off.

I swallowed, stifled a bit of nervous laughter. Tonights game wasnt just mean as hell  there was a good chance it would start raising hell the moment it sensed me. That meant Id have a narrow window in which to wrap this up and get back to my books.

Whats the use in study without application? I muttered, wincing at the nervous squeak edging into my voice. I grumbled as I climbed into the stand and began setting up my equipment. Theres no point in going into the specifics  you use the best tools for the job, you take a rifle approach rather than the flashy, wasteful, expensive shotgun approach.

Leaning back against the little stands far wall, I dug out a beaten book describing trajectories and similarly hellish concepts. Mathematics are a bitch, but they come with the territory. A little review before the test never hurt  and as I watched the angles of the suns rays changing, I knew the test was fast approaching.

Soon enough I stopped bothering with the suns light closed the book and slipped it into my pack. There comes a time when youve studied about all that you can study. Instead I loaded a 15-round clip into my sleek M-4, my fingers tracing the scripture inscribed in its cool barrel. Moving slowly, quietly, I positioned myself for the nights hunt.

My ears turned down the sounds of night: the cicadas, frogs, crickets, the hiss of pine needles against the stands roof in the warm wind. Instead they sought unnatural sounds, and found them: the heavy hiss of fabric against the old game trail. From the black-and-white mass of the nighttime marsh forest they came: the gaudiness of their skimpy leather vestments clashed with their ample rolls of white skin and bizarre faces: it was as if something had hooked their mandibles, maxilla, and pulled both  gums, teeth, and all  forward into glistening pinkish-red snouts.

I shook my head against the reality of the situation. Even after all Id come across tracking down the church these things belonged to - the Ethertide Enclave; I'm currently a journeyman Tracker pursuing the rank of Huntmaster -, life was still full of surprises: these leather-bound things with the struggling prisoner a third of their ilk was dragging into my field of view, my bosss claims about himself and the rumors surrounding the guy that had put out the hit on this macabre trio. 

To call these brightly clad horrors demonic, or even draconic if you consider the fanglike protrusions of tooth and bone studding their snouts, would be a misnomer. A demon had taken out a contract on the nights prey; the old monk who called himself our boss, claiming to be a dragon in disguise, had judged it worthy of our time. And, he had judged me worthy of making the hit.

I listened to the malformed cultists words. Their speech was garbled by their snouts, but Im not wordsmith, so Ill give it to you straight: The Elders of this world have turned the engines of Industry into a black blade, and with this foul soul-stealing blade they unleash a storm of death, and violence, disguised as 

The monologue ended with the thunder of the M-4. I kept still, quiet as their would-be sacrifice darted off into the darkness. My superiors hadnt said anything about her. I waited in silence. The thump of a pinecone against my stands roof nearly made me start. I reigned in my nerves, and exited the stand to get evidence of my nights work.

The rotten odor hit me like a brick. Something was nearby. I knelt at the deformed cultists and did my work, keeping my eyes on the marshlands before me. Letting them adjust to the darkness, scanning and finding nothing. Strange thing was that the sounds of the night remained  whatever carried the stink of decay hadnt scared the swamp critters into silence.

Rising, I turned slowly and saw it crouched atop my deer stand. Large, three-taloned feet grasped the edges of the stands roof. They appeared to be rough, leathery and shifting from the shade of the tree behind my stand to that of the roof. Likewise the limber things quill-like mantle of fur  looking like pine needles, now that I think about it  was in mid change from the green of the foliage to the mottling of my stands camouflage patterns. Eyes set in a flat skull with a blunt snout glowed like coals in the dark. 

In a swift motion it sprang, landed before me with its two thickly muscled forelimbs supporting the bulk of its weight. Slender hindlegs, crooked like a frogs appeared tense with gathering energy. The sight of this thing obliterated my training.

I bolted, glanced back and saw it tending to the dead cultists. Almost lovingly, it gathered in their limbs, went about fixing the bodies. Soon enough I heard it loping after me. 

I made it to the hunting camp and set about securing the cabin against the creature. As I ran about bolting the doors, my mind wandered to the strange shapes Id seen carved and drilled into the panels about the hunting cabin. I had notice them a couple of times as a kid. Afterward they became a part of the background, hardly worth mentioning.

Now they were like neon signs proclaiming SAFETY against whatever that thing  maybe a bigfoot? Its feet were pretty big  was circling the cabin. Gun at the read, I kept low and listened for the things progress. I followed it, noticing that it seemed to stray further from the cabins exterior when it neared areas baring those sigils.

As the night dragged on, I settled down before one of the sigils with the stack of books Id brought to prep for my exam. M-4 at the ready, I reflected on something Id read: in states of panic, the mind is as a dehydrated man in a desert, drinking down whatever knowledge it can find.

Who knows.

Maybe theres something in these books that will give me an idea of how to take down the thing stalking around the cabin. Could be Ill need to get some of those sigils etched into my tools before I try, but I imagine youd get a nice jacket out of the things leathery hide. It'd be a fine uniform for a Huntmaster.

My mundane thoughts and ambitions were, and continue to be, a shield against the implications of the thing, the cultists, and their rant against the Elders of the world.

<TEXT> Thanks breh. Unless I misread your Ice and Fire lore, George has created a land, Valyria, in which the inheritors of the old 'tech' actually bring about further deterioration of their society rather than advance society? FWIW, your own lore sounds like a good way to explain societies that are seemingly in a time-period stasis (as the world of Ice and Fire seems to be).

In my OP I'm looking at a scenario in which the elder races are instrumental in the setting being able to reach a technological level akin to our own in the face of younger race(s) that would undo all of that progress. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is pretty much a staple of fantasy to some extent. You can substitute Old and New for Nature vs Technology if you're of the Tolkienian school. I was showering, thinking about finding a theme with which to knit my setting together - and I came up with a set-up where elder forces (Dragons, demons, angels, all that good stuff) are necessary for mankind's advancement in the face of some New Bizarre Race* that works to bring industrialization to a halt.

Have you see it done in fantasy lit, in particular, are there any big settings here in r/worldbuilding that play with this concept? I'd be interested in further research on this spin on the concept of "Old vs New."

*New Bizarre Race meaning something alien, recently emerged; not necessarily something you've never seen in the fantasy or SF genre.

<TEXT> For film purposes? I'd have a weakened King Piccolo appeal to the Red Ribbon Army leader's sense of ambition and use their resources to located the dragon balls. Then once he regains his youth, he creates a few of his signature spawn from the anime, leaving Goku and co to deal with RR and the spawn before they get to Piccolo himself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, with Malaz I didn't have any moments where I had to stop and ask myself why I was reading it.

Have you read Richard Morgan's A Land Fit For Heroes? That trilogy has a big war between humans and dragons/dragonfolk as the backdrop. There's even a repressive theocratic regime that took power in the aftermath by lending soldiers and funds to the kingdoms involved in the war.

That's Dragonlance, done right. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If they were high priority targets, you'd have a good point. The idea is that the pueblo PC and castle PC are at about the same educational level as the other villagers. As for the idea of a commando-type PC, they could go for ambiguity ie other soldiers intercept the PC at the end of the game and take 'em away.

Are they undercover US agents? Are they Saddler's goons? I'd leave it vague.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A little while ago I was talking with a couple of acquaintances. While I'm in the middle of a hunting story, one of them asks out of the blue, "are you seeing anyone?" I say that I'm not and keep going with my story.

Some weeks later the same girl comes up to me and asks how I'm doing, academically. I'm like, "yeah, I'm doing fine." She tells me where she and her friend like to go study. I reply with "yeah, I could use a white board at my place for studying." She breaks it off and walks off, I go back to studying.

Some weeks later, she stops by to tell me when she and her friend will be studying. Its brief, but she's kinda smiley through the whole exchange here about lab technique.

Now she's back to giving me funny, kinda perturbed looks. Did I accidentally come off as a jerkwad at some point here? </TEXT>

Something like

4 Death's Shadow

4 Tarmogoyf

2 Scavenging Ooze

4 Dark Confidant

2 Tireless Tracker

1 Pia and Kiran Nalaar

2 Huntmaster of the Fells

2 Thundermaw Hellkite

<TEXT> Bardoc the Magus of the Hidden Way

Bardoc believed that talents defined the individual, shaped the identity. The talents an individual developed were intimately tied to certain locations across the world, or certain objects, or certain events. So Bardoc started a rogue order of magi, called the Hidden Way, that took the Sajin teachings of balancing mind and body and went out on his own. The "Hidden Way" refers to the loci tied to the individual magi's talent.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is a spin on the "my elves/goblins/dragons" are different threads  - here we post a hilarious quirk of our races that distinguish them from what you'd expect.

Rule of Two in effect - you comment on two posts before posting your own, unless you are the first person to reply to my OP.

My Elves are hilariously different: in a primitive world populated by simians, goblins, and devils, the elves mostly keep to their unusually sturdy trees that spring up from the nightsoil. They gained a nasty reputation from their penchant for tossing their dung at one another during inter-tree warfare. From this the elves became unwitting masters of biological warfare. It built them a fierce reputation.

Reality is - they are slope-browed turd-tossers that got lucky. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Blood Magus, one of the Blood Magi. He entered into a covenant with a pride-driven dragon that required him to steal a magic chalice. Supposedly there was some magical property in this artifact that would allow an era of peace unending to sweep the world.

So the Blood Magus stole the chalice, used its magic to destroy the dragon with which he made the convenant. Now he roams the world doing heroic deeds - they were his bread and butter; with the chalice under his control, he need not worry about the threat of unending peace putting an end to his career. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My .02: of the recent villainous heroes, or heroic villains, whichever you like to call them, I found that I really enjoyed Will Smith's Deadshot - even more than Batman and Superman (in most any of the incarnations I've encountered, not strictly the ones we saw in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice). My initial attraction was entirely aesthetic - cool costume, nice guns. But seeing that this guy ended up saving the world simply so that his daughter would think he was an alright guy, it really adds a dimension of humanity that I can relate to.

To pull from Game of Thrones - take Stannis Baratheon. In the books, he's one man hellbent on doing the right thing. I found it refreshing given the series abundance of political subterfuge and betrayals. Stannis's use of shadow magic and blood magic via burning his prisoners - executing people that earned a death sentence, but getting a use out of the execution - added a touch of humanity. It made him interesting, slightly dangerous, and made him more fun to read about. But what makes draws me to Stannis is that he's using this blood magic and shadow magic against monsters far worse than he is.

An acquaintance of mine was writing a paper on Shakespeare or someone like that. She asked if I'd read him and liked the classics since I've got the highest GPA in our department. I laughed, told her I like Stephen King and Conan the Barbarian. She didn't care, thought it was funny.

<TEXT> I'd say Lorwyn is my least favorite, Flamekin aside. The art direction didn't really inspire or encourage me - and the switch to Shadowmoor didn't really give you any explanation as to where all these new and exciting beasties were coming from.

That said, the Flamekin and crazy elementals were the saving grace from LorTide Block.

Our Return blocks have also felt smaller than the originals, and thereby aren't as great. </TEXT>

I want Temur to get more too OP. Best art in Tarkir came from the Temur. They needed something more, though. I like the idea of Blue to protect your beasties, although stuff like [[Show and Tell]] that only lets you drop creatures and forces your critters to fight with your opponent's critters also feels Temur. </TEXT>

This is what I had in Standard - looking for advice on how to port it into Frontier:

2 [[Jace, Vryn's Prodigy]]

2 [[Soulfire Grand Master]]

4 [[Mantis Rider]]

4 [[Thunderbreak Regent]]

2 [[Dragonlord Ojutai]]

4 [[Wild Slash]]

2 [[Roast]]

1 [[Valorous Stance]]

4 [[Draconic Roar]]

4 [[Silumgar's Scorn]]

4 [[Jeskai Charm]]

3 [[Dig Through Time]]

4 [[Flooded Strand]]

4 [[Polluted Delta]]

2 [[Island]]

2 [[Mountain]]

1 [[Plains]]

1 [[Prairie Stream]]

4 [[Mystic Monastery]]

4 [[Spirebluff Canal]]

2 [[Wandering Fumarole]]

What should I do with my spell lineup?

I am assuming a Goodstuff.dec SB with [[Reflector Mage]] and [[Spell Queller]] alongside [[Radiant Flames]] and targeted counterspells would be worthwhile. </TEXT>

**Navajko** - The Navajko were initially concentrated along the equatorial archipelago called Chain of Fire. They worshiped tusked, trunked, maned Regent Dragons, for these creatures were sources of ivory, leather, furs and food. When the ice age hit the Regents, recognizing the Navajko as their successors, laid a spell on the Navajko. It gave the Navajko the ability to shift into tusked, trunked, fanged, manned, furred man-beasts whose magic would allow them to survive the ice age.

**Sajin** - The Sajin splintered from the Navajko, heading south to establish their first major holding on Eberrai. They retained the characteristics of mankind's common ancestor, the scaled ape - thick brow ridges, and serpentine scaling patterns along their extremities and trunk. From these patterns the Sajin developed a philosophy emphasizing the use of body-mind to tap into the world's magic.

**Krolithzu** - The Krolithzu remained on the northernmost continent, Meteorfall, while the Navajko ancestors set out to explore the southern realms before settling the Chain of Fire. Krolithzu retained quilllike growths, lichen patches in the skin folds, of mankind's common ancestor. They have since split into three other tribes - Geddlithi, Krolothrai, Azu.

<TEXT> My world is built around the concept of busting your ass to build something worthwhile, fulfilling. Dragonborn are the industrial extreme with strong sociopathic tendencies, while Naga are at the opposite end of that spectrum. Humans kind of shift along it. Djinn and Efreet are the extremes of human emotion - cold logic and deadly compassion - manifested; emotions that I feel would thrive in a setting based around self-actualization through self-sacrifice.

<TEXT> Dragonborn have spadelike skulls affixed to thick necks with a lengthy tail that provides a counterbalance to their bodymass. Folds in their skin are home to fungal growths once used by their ancestors to endure an ice age.

Naga have flat, triangular skulls with slim, soft bodies ending in a thick tail. Vestigial wings, stunted, attest to a shared ancestry with the Dragonborn.

Vaku are cloven-hooved quadrupeds with scales, quill manes and boarlike skulls ending in a long, tusked snout ideal for burrowing and goring. Their forelimbs end into jointed, hooflike digits that allow them to grasp and use tools.

Djinn are an ethereal folk with flat faces, beady black eyes and horns that curl down around their heads.

Efreet are a slender folk of brimstone, given life by magical fire and lightning. They share the flat faces of the Djinn, except their horns sweep back from their head.

<TEXT> I find a theme and application. Here's what I've got on the nonhumans for my world:

Dragonborn - Sociopathic ambition directed toward industry

Naga - Sociopathic ambition directed toward self-pity 

Vaku - Individual communities driven to competition against one another

Djinn - Communal desire to see balance brought amidst the chaos of the Naga, Dragonborn, and Efreet.

Efreet - Individualistic desire to help those victimized by the Dragonborn, Naga, Djinn and humans.

Stuff like catfolk and elephantfolk lurk in the background as demigod figures for various cultures. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If it fits the theme, I wouldn't take it off the table. Case in point, Steven Erikson has crafted an extremely egalitarian setting in his Malazan novels. Yet there's something incredibly brutal in the ninth book that reflects on the book's themes of empires in decay, peoples falling, cosmic acts of horror and greater cosmic acts of compassion.

I'm not gonna spoil it, you can google "Dust of Dreams controversy" and find it if you like. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **The Demon Wind** - Demon Wind is a tattooed mob boss that believes his past lives are etched upon his skin in his tattoos. According to Demon Wind, he was stranded on Flamedroi (my world) by one of his infernal peers. The past lives are the chains that keep him bound to Flamedroi.

To Demon Wind, the chains of mortality are a curse - so his best alchemists, pimps, smugglers and soldiers are gifted with supernatural forms and abilities. All of Demon Wind's schemes are directed at opening a portal to the infernal realm so that he might lure in, and murder, the demon that stranded him on Flamedroi.

Demon Wind's name reflects his nature - he is as unpredictable as the demon winds (hurricanes, in Eberraise speak). He might work to preserve the world upon which he is trapped, or carve swaths of pain and misery when triggered by his anger toward the demon that stranded him on Flamedroi. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Krolothrai** are humanoid in shape, but giantesque in that they grow to a height of nine to ten feet. Broad of shoulder, they are a bestial-looking people from the Frontier Bivouac of Meteor Fall (northernmost continent). Their usual attire consists of bones, leathers, scales, feathers, and quills. All taken from the reptiles, quilled/furred drakes, and wyverns native to Meteor Fall.

The Krolothrai see technology as a natural extension of human ingenuity. To them, the use of and development of technology, is an extension of Nature's Will. Krolothrai gather technology by departing Meteor Falls and wandering the world, serving in foreign armies, mercenary companies, mining companies.

Their spiritual focus is around gaining strength by devouring the fallen - the carnivore is nourished while the prey is returned to the earth. From this return, the prey may be reborn. Typically oozes native to Meteor Fall will scavenge the remains - these oozes are used to brew aphrodisiacs, so the belief is that the newborns of the Krolothrai are the fallen, reincarnated.  </TEXT>

It sounded like a strange question so I just kinda said "Uh, not at the moment," and went on with my story.

So my question is - is this one of them there things saying "ask me out for drinks?" I didn't know if it was that or just a shot at starting a new line of conversation while we killed time.  </TEXT>

I liked Majin Vegeta

I didn't like the fact that they were unclear about why Supreme Kai had to let Babidi's fighters steal Gohan's energy - I would've thrown in something about Babidi's magic preventing the Supreme Kai and Z Fighters from tracking him down - hence the need to let the lackeys lead them to the ship. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Avoiding the Noble Savage </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-10 05:16:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Something I'm aiming to do in my worldbuilding is avoid the noble savage with my more primitive-looking tribes. In looking for inspiration, I've turned to Steven Erikson's Barghast from the Malazan Book of the Fallen Series:

* Barghast initially presented as a broad-n-burly warrior bunch that're fighting for their beast gods.

* Barghast believe in a prophesied final battle against a great enemy.

* A queen takes a Barghast tribesman as a lover, gets kind of uppity; Barghast tribesman makes a joke about hobbling her for being uppity if she belonged to him (we later see a hobbling; its horrific, but its not done to the queen in my example).

Is this a good way of avoiding the noble savage? This tribe's got its warriorlike ways, driven by a warriorlike quest based in prophecy, but also possess some customs that we would see as savage and inhumane. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Myth**

Five Primeval Dragons crawled from the cold, dark depths of space - they were **Reshrith the White Wolf**, **Salaxlotl the Salamander**, **Hydrark the Serpent**, **Flydevi the Storm**, and **Axhru the Axe** - and fought with Primordial Elementals in vast cities built by the Primordials. Their battle was focused around the **Solar Heart** - a sun approaching a supernova.

At the battle's height the sun exploded, consuming Primeval and Primordial alike. Those that survived found themselves on a world birthed from the explosion.

**Reality**

There were five races of Primeval Dragon resembling the legendary Primevals - **Reshrith**, **Salaxlotl**, **Flydevi**, **Hydrark** and **Axhu**. Individual dragons from each of these races were drawn to a ring of ruined planets surrounding the sun. Across the ruins they found suitable prey, hunted it to extinction, and turned on one another. Their fighting released enough energy to trigger a Big Bang.

From the Big Bang came my world, where the offspring of these five Primeval races were left to contend with the new world's innate defense system: great elementals that have since been described as Primordials, for their size, power, and command of the planet's various defense mechanisms ie magic. 

Notably, the dragons didn't come from no where - they were descended from an older founding race called the Foreshi. The Foreshi, along with the Progenti, Engineers, and Shifters once inhabited the ring of ruined planets to which the Primeval Dragon races were drawn. An innate migratory instinct is likely what brought the Primevals back to the wrecked home of their ancestors. </TEXT>

Naga - you'll end up a sacrifice to the Bloodfolk if we're talking the naga from Shadow; or, you'll simply get thrown out of the mountain lair and left to fend for yourself if you're a naga from Eberrai.

Shifters - they care for their sick. If its terminal, the individual suffering is taken to the druids and used as a pharmacy guineapig for the druids' research. It is for the good of the tribe - and their beliefs in reincarnation say that death simply sows the soul, so that a new Shifter may grow from the forest's soil. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Meteorfall** - This claims that a red meteor - the hardened wings of Primeval Salaxlotl - crashed on barren strip of land floating in space. From this impact came waters that carved up the land, bringing with it the potential for new life. It is a creation myth from the northernmost continent, Meteor Fall.

**Sandstorm** - This legend is one that all the children from the continent Shadow are taught at a young age. It is said that Primeval Flydevi created an army of sand elementals, razing the magnificent temples of the Bloodfolk. After which, Flydevi used the winds to blow seeds and pollen from across the sea into the barren wastes of Shadow, creating a beautiful continent of temple gardens and ruined cities filled with a variety of vibrant flora.

<TEXT> The idea of the drow is intriguing - but much of what I've seen of the dark elves in Forgotten Realms' Menzoberranzan doesn't strike me as all that plausible.

Now, Jarlaxle's Bregan D'aethe is a bit more reasonable - they're still chaotic, but focused on making bank to keep their lifestyle going. Do you all have any other novels/quick-n-dirty writeups on how to make the drow a feasible foe, as opposed to chaotic "how are these things not dead yet?" </TEXT>

Historically, Tarkir could become Kami 2.0. Replace Kami vs Humans with Elementals vs Dragons...humans disgruntled with the dragons deify elementals, making them a threat to the dragons...let the other human societies develop more into a palatable version of Kamigawa. Complete with ninjas, rakshasa in place of oni and naga in place of the ogres that worshipped the oni etc.

<TEXT> For me, its when they act like whatever they resemble. If I have some lionfolk, then a male might regale his companions with the time he slaughtered a rival, the rival's offspring, and took the rival's mate as his own. The others would likely be aghast while the lionfolk doesn't think twice about it.

Aesthetically I change the bauplan ever so slightly - make 'em a bit strange looking. My dragonborn, for example (the D D things with scales and tits in the case of females from 4E), have a muscular tail that counterbalances their broad chests, thick necks and large, blunted snouts. The lionfolk I mentioned above might have broad shoulders, a large trunk tapering down to a narrow lower body and limber, muscular hindlegs.

Stuff like that OP. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I've drafted up about three different peoples. I'm not sure if they'd be better served as say...genasi, dwarves, and...trolls perhaps, or if they still work fine as human cultures.

Preface - I know there's genasi of differing elements and all, but the one I've got that most fits the genasi are a sea-based culture...

**Geddlith**  A limber, light-boned folk who owe their calcified skin to the balance struck by their God Primeval Reshrith and its sorcery of Armageddon (which burned out the veins of magic  within that neck of the world). The Geddlith are practitioners of lithomancy, crafting magic-resistant swords imbued with their own special sorcery. This is their primary source of income. The Geddlith are an industrious people that used their skills in lithomancy and wire-fighting to settle their region of Tundra. (or, should these be dwarves instead of calcified humans?)



**Zuhyd**  A stocky folk whose fish belly pale skins are marked from birth by seafoam glyphs resembling either a drake on wing, a storm of faeries, or a carplike elemental.  The glyph forms demarcate the Zuhyds role in their society, though their mind-rending magic gives them upward mobility despite their birth glyphs. Battles of the mind allow the victorious Zuhyd to take on the glyphs of the loser. Zuhyd make their way whaling, serpenting, and harvesting the seas; they are nonviolent in their captures, preferring to attack their preys mind rather than inflict physical violence on these great sea behemoths.

Their desire to make their earnings without spilling the blood of their targets is driven by a fear of their capricious God Primeval Hydrei. The Zuhyd believe that the blood would wake Hydrei; while the God Primevals central head encouraged the Zuhyd to abandon It in so that they may thrive, the other two heads cried out for blood. So, to avoid waking a God Primeval that would help as readily as it would hurt them, the Zuhyd make it a point to no spill the blood of their kill in the seas. (or, should these be genasi given the blue glyph thing that ties them to the sea?)


**Krolothra**  A tall folk whose society is built around the hunt. They wear the hides of their kills while the essence of the beasts live on in the hunters mindscape. The Krolothra believe themselves to be speakers for the beasts whose essence inhabits their mindscape. Krolothra ensure that no part of their kill goes to waste  the meat and organs are used for food. Hides are cured and stored until the Krolothra has taken down five different beasts  then the hides are used to create the Krolothras distinct armor.

Krolothra, once fully armored, then leave their treetop villages and hire on as mercenaries in foreign companies. They seek causes that they believe in and return with trophies of their service. These are the source of friendly competition between Krolothrai  the winner of such competitions usually claims the mate of the loser, then the loser and his or her offspring are killed and eaten. It is believed that the loser and his/her progeny will be reborn from the forest, after having sojourned through the victors mindscape and gained self-improvement from the victors life experiences.

The Krolothra trace this practice to their God Primeval Thragkhro  who, once fallen, beseeched the Navajko from which all humans of Flamedroi trace common ancestry, to partake of her flesh. From this the Navajko gained wisdom, and strength. This is the Krolothra justification for their savage treatment of the submissives. (Or, should they be trolls given their size and affinity for beasts?)

<TEXT> Banefire Berserkers - Banefire Berserkers is a mercenary army comprised of berserkers (fighters), artillery (mages and munitions), and dragonspeakers (shaman responsible for controlling the pit dragons).

Armageddon Dawning - An army comprised of Stonesplicers, hailing from the continent Jesojutei. On their own, the Stonesplicers aren't intimidating - tall, but lean and willowy with calcified-white skin brought on by the hardships of their homeland; they have survived literal armageddons caused by the wars between the efreet and djinn. Their talents are in their ability to craft magical blades on the spot. The army is comprised of mystics (the actual forgers), tabernacle magi (wizards whose enchantments can lock up an enemy's automatic weapons), and the exalted (can summon angels).

Wild Razers - The Wildrazers are a large, earthy folk that dress themselves in the hides and scales of their kills. Wildrazers are pure mercenaries, seeking coin for whatever cause they deem worth their while. Their records as mercenaries are discussed within their tribe, often as a source of competition among members of the tribe.

The Tide Sculptors - The Tide Sculptors are psionics often brought in to prevent conflict by scrambling the brains of warmongers. They are distinguished by their pallid complexions and vibrant blue tattoos mimicking the gyri and sulci of the human brain. Their mind-rending leads to further infighting among a given warmongers' lackeys. Thus Sculptors employ their talents to create conflicts that let them fully explore the human psyche by observing the actions of their target and the target's underlings.

**Frontierfolk** - Alloys of dragonscale and iron that form, keloid like, along appendages most often used in spellcasting.

**Tundrafolk** - Glyphs or upgraded epidermis reflecting magic use:

  *Mind Sculptors* - Glowing blue glyphs resembling the gyri and sulci of the brain.

  *Stoneforgers* - Calcified skin, giving them an alabaster or chalky white appearance with a lighter bone structure and longer limbs. 

  *Wildspeakers* - A more simian appearance with a rough, earthen cast to their skin.
  
  *Abyssal Veil* - Their blood is blackish in appearance, signifying the presence of a patron demon inhabiting their body. They have a greyish look and a more muscular build from the demon having consumed their fat for sustenance.

So really, that makes the elves, dwarves, and orcs superfluous. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Efreeti**: They're a monastic order of firefolk that temper their draconic gifts with cold logic. There are two denominations of efreet - the Oju and Tei.

*Tei* - To their mind, they must use their gifts of Primevals' fire to give lesser creatures hunted to extinction a last great hurrah. Thus, their magic, extremely destructive, uses Primeval fire to denature the fabric of reality. From these burning gashes come great old behemoths from the days of yore. The world corrects itself by dragging these creatures back to their proper time period, but not before they get to taste revenge against humankind.

*Oju* - Oppose the reckless destruction of the Tei efreet. They blend logic with compassion and chose to focus on what the Primevals did right: the angels and the sorceries of clear judgment employed by the Primevals near the time of their downfall. The Oju are a folk eager to employ their talents in angel-summoning and cleansing the present day evils that, flourishing, appear to them as monuments to the cruelty of the primevals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Primevals - the greatest of the great; they descended from a foundling race called the Foreshi. They possess all the viciousness of their ancestors, except on a grander scale. Their primary prey was the Primordials.


Regents - the progeny of the Primordials; these out-competed the Primevals, driving their ancestors into extinction. The Regents were brought down by idols of sticks and stones to which they were bound by their neanderthal servitors. There's magic that lets you summon Regents, though the sorcerous emanations that roll from them in waves warps, slashes, and crushes the surrounding environs, or may raise the dead or trigger religious frenzy.


Pit Dragons - the lesser of the dragons; these are manufactured by the shaman on the continent of Thundermaw in the Thunderbreak Clutch (one of the many countries on Thundermaw). Pit dragons were instrumental in the founding of Thundermaw - in the past there was a Dragon War in which Thunderbreak agents worked to acquire as many Regent Idols as possible; from these they learned how to create the pit dragons. </TEXT>

Ketzalku - Serpentine reptiles with atrophied wings that're born with an ingrained fear of dragons and the Vaik. They utilize their psychic venom to get the right blend of juices - guilt and fear - flowing through their prey so as to have a viable host for their eggs.

Efreet - Simianlike beings of fire and lavarock whose inhuman sense of compassion was forged by the fires of draconic tyranny. Their rebellious magic rips the very fabric of time, bringing forth behemoths they believe were unjustly extincted by the Primeval Dragons.

Engineers - Green-scaled apelike creatures that practice a bloody Children of the Corn sort of elemental worship. Seeing the horrors the dragons, angels, demons and humans, they believe elementals are the inheritors of the world.

Orochi are the end result of a human choosing to act as host for a naga hatchling. The hatchling - thrown off out of the naga's mountain nest for whatever reason - integrates with its human host, changing the host in order to survive. At the end of this process the host appears green-skinned with a reticulated pattern, red-eyed, and with an extra set of arms mimicking the vestigial wings common to all naga hatchlings. Most orochi, driven by the naga hatchling's desire to thrive, are single-minded in their pursuits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Savro

A shaman whose fragile self-image, despite his somewhat muscular physique, is rooted in a struggle with childhood obesity. He believes in taking care of oneself first - then you worry about everything else. Having been raised with the expectation that he would be used as fodder for the pit dragons, Savro neglected his body and focused solely on the mind.

As he neared adulthood, ramifications of Savro's decision hit him like a raging thraghorn...during an attack on his village by the vaku lizard-beasts, Savro saw his father, an accomplished shaman, drop dead from a heart attack. In the aftermath Savro came to accept that death is a natural part of the life cycle but that he had the power to mitigate that...by training the body as rigorously as he had trained the mind.

In finding his new path, Savro found the confidence to fully enjoy his passions while employing magic based around death and decay. His broad-framed build is muscular, though not unrealistic, and he wears the hides and skulls of the reptilian vaku whose attack triggered his father's heart attack. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sneak

Sneak's an ifrit that, like all ifrit, can burn through the aether with its magic, freeing monstrosities from the dawn of time - gargantuan wurms, demons of legend, even the Dragon Tyrants of yore; nothing is off the table where the ifrit style of magic is concerned. Only drawback is, these chaotically-conjured beasts are dragged back into the aether (part of the world's innate defense mechanisms) in the blink of an eye.

That's all right - the blink of an eye's all the time it takes for these displaced beasts to do some major damage.

<TEXT> The Ahriochi have jade hides patterned like a lizard's skin. They've developed the skill of empathomancy and used it to shape cities that match their emotional state. Within their cities the Ahriochi pursue vices - food, drink, or fighting. Their primary food source are the elementals drawn by the magical radiation coming from the Ahriochi use of emphathomancy.

He's driven toward achieving his goal. He's not letting anything get in his way. This makes him a bit unpredictable in the sense that he'll probably act predictably, even when the predictable choice may seem morally unlikely. Its a flaw of his character that I enjoy almost as much as his grit and determination to see his quest to its end. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know Hobb's a big name in dragon fantasy (I'll say no more, it would spoil too much for those who haven't read her), but it felt like she spent a good 300-ish pages per novel beating around the bush before getting to the meat of her plots (its the strength of those that helped me persevere through the opening fluff) - whereas with McCaffery, it seems like she gets right to it, based on Dragonflight.

I am excited about the SF touch - I love when it creeps into my fantasy. That's another part of my attraction...

...and since I'm speaking on dragon fantasy, I should also mention I've read Wizard of Earthsea...should I go on and finish out this series too? </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Cult of Entropy Inevitable** - A cult found in the coastal bayous of Eberrai that was founded by an Takejukai expat. The founder discovered shrines of petrified wood and stone dedicated to the Foreshi, a foundling race of the setting. The cult forged compacts with the Foreshi, gaining the creatures' assistance in exploiting the fossil fuel rich lands of Eberrai.

They figure that if the goods are there to be gotten, they may as well get 'em because someone will eventually.

**The Sajin Sages**

The Sajin is an order of mage-monks that used their clout to begin a worldwide enforcement of an edict that required magic users to hone body and mind in accordance with the Sajin scrolls. Scrolls given to them by the jackal-apes from which the Sajin claim humankind has descended.

The Sajin soon relaxed their edict when it left many urban regions unable to deal with gangsters that had made compacts with the oni, gaining the demons' magic and thus getting the upperhand on the various law enforcement agencies that would combat them.

Today the Sajin are focused on continuing education, a blending of science and holisticism in an attempt to open magic to all that wish to learn it without the need of demonic bargains, or hiring out various underworld groups.

**The Trepanation Triad**

The Trepanation Triad is an organization that rose when the Sajin began the worldwide enforcement of their edict. This organization harvested the CNS of skilled mage-monks for study, producing miraculous drugs that would allow almost anyone to access the world's magical veins.

For the most part, they have become defunct with the relaxation of the Sajin edicts.

My main critique is that this focused more on the undeath aspects of BG. When I look at BG, I see a color combination that understands the rules set forth by nature, understands the necessity of those rules and is willing to use all the tools available to accomplish its goals by either bending or warping the rules...but never outright breaking them.

It seems like TM's leaning more toward explaining the flavor of the guilds' mechanics - like he did with Dredge here. That might be a good starting point for the subsequent videos. Focus on the guild mechanic and how it ties into the guild colors.

In one of the Malazan novels, I think there was a line like "its fucking raining dragons," which I liked. I also remember that one from Reaper's Gale mentioned in this thread. Great scene, and the line didn't take me out of it anymore than their solution for the dragon problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the hierarchy of dragons, you have Primevals -- Regents -- Pit Dragons, with PDs being the bottom of the foodchain.

The Regents are unique in that, conjuring one, require an offering. Regents conjured through this method are somewhat translucent - you can see the silhouette of the offerings struggling against the dragon's inner flames.

It was a neat visual I stole from some Suicide Squad concept art for Incubus - in one the demon didn't have any armor/metal, so you could see the shadows of the people he had been feeding on within the flames. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My favorite training sequence would have to be Bruce's recovery in The Dark Knight Rises. We don't see much of it, but the stakes were what made it enjoyable - you get me invested in the threat posed by the antagonist and the training sequence will be much more enjoyable. I was practically cheering for Bruce's return to Gotham and subsequent thrashing of Bane.

I can't think of anything in the fantasy genre, written, that really stands out for me. Much of what I've read in terms of training tends to have just been the character going from lesson to lesson. I never felt like there was any sense of urgency or danger, so these I tended to put aside for longer stretches of time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think The Silent Blade is the strongest of Bob's Legend of Drizzt entries. I remember thinking it was a fairly deep look at the characters, in the context of the novels that had come before.

<TEXT> The Fellowship dynamic is what I enjoyed most, I think. It reminded me of Two Towers or Return of the King where you have the fellowship of heroes doing into the dark land to deal with the darklord. Its the earthier motives that worked for me - "no money, no honey," keeping Colonel Flag alive because if he died, then the squad would die - as opposed to standing up against a nebulous evil simply because its "what's right."

I did find Croc lacking in backstory - nothing there but a mobster that got run out of Gotham. I was hoping for a little more, maybe black market organ trade or something like that. Seems fitting for someone prone to cannibalism.

I do hope the sequel plays more geopolitics - the comic's strength is the way it interweaves stuff like metahuman teams with geopolitics. The Jihad is a group I'd like to see tackled in the sequel - they attack America for war crimes we comitted in Qurac (Iraq analogue) and have a nifty set of superpowers. 

On the Marvel end, how well received was Shane Black's Iron Man 3? Having seen most every MCU movie sans Dr Strange and Civil War, I would say that Marvel has yet to top IM3; I would've added this if Mandarin had his magic rings or we got a cool extremis dragon like the one from the comics. Fang, I think he's called there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, the only thing they left out of Boomerang's character in the movie is that he's a womanizer (though in the movie he helped them scout out Enchantress and Incubus's spell rig). In one of the comics he tried to trick some college coeds into doing a "model shoot" while the squad was trying to uncover some secret society hiding beneath the college.

I like beer, brawls, and women, so I found myself liking Boomer. Smith and Harley were the mains, though you can also throw in Diablo for his backstory as a gangbanger and Flag. Albeit with Flag his story is mostly told through the way he acts around the squad at the beginning vs the end.

<TEXT> "An individual is free to have whatever they want, provided they have the power to obtain and keep it"


"Everyone seems preoccupied with the meaning of life. Red's not, because red already knows the answer. You see, your heart tells you what it needs to be fulfilled. All you have to do is listen to it and act accordingly. It's not a mystery."

"Green is the one color that doesn't want to change the world because green is convinced that the world already got everything right. The natural order is a thing of beauty and has all the answers to life's problems. The key is learning to sit back and recognize what is right in front of you."

I tend to look at novels that use these kind of characters as case studies in abnormal psychology.

The world's expansion in Red Queen's War was equally great. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree - it gave us something that Goku couldn't beat on his own, no matter how strong he got via training. The biggest weakness is a lack of background for 17 and 18 that explains how they wound up with Gero. The second weak point is Cell's transformations; I preferred the first one over the other two, but liked how Perfect Cell didn't really feel a need to destroy for the sake of destroying. Perfect Cell knew he was the strongest guy around and just wanted to have some fun.

I didn't need anything deep for 17 or 18. We know Android Gero was probably upset about Goku breaking up the RR Army back in Dragonball, which was sufficient motivation for this series. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On a lark I decided to try drafting up some fantasy critters with a Lovecraftian feel. Old primal gods slumbering...waking...lost knowledge...intrigues...all that. The meat of his stuff rather than just the tentacles and fishiness. 

I could use your help in refining these ideas. If it helps, I listened to Pickman's Model, Unknown Kadath and The Haunter in the Dark on audiobook for inspiration.

*

**Dragons**  Frozen in the depths of space like the Ogdru-Jahad from Hellboy

**Angels**  Bound by prison seals in ruined temples scattered throughout the dark woods. Visually they resemble the angels of the Bible.

**Elementals**  Lurking in the wilds bound to groves by ape-magic.

**Leviathans**  Imprisoned in trench-bottom ammonite temples by the Salamanderfolk.

**Demons**  Doomed to haunt a magical pit found in one of the ratfolk  nests-turned-library.

*

**Lizardfolk**  In the entropic lands the Lizardfolk, driven to create in response to the destruction wrought by the Salamanderfolk, ratfolk and apes, eventually began warping the aether by blending homunculi, apes, and ratfolk to create a race possessing the hunger of the ratfolk, the ingenuity of the apes, and the resolve of the homunculi  they called the new race human.  

With their newly created race the Lizardfolk seek to create a folk that would survive the upheavals that could come from freeing the dragons frozen in the depths of space. If they are to continue creating, the Lizardfolk feel that a shakeup from the freeing of the dragons is necessary  without it, they believe their world will become barren, sterile, devoid of meaning.

**Apes**  In the entropic lands the apes took it upon themselves to tame the bizarre elementals that haunted their jungles. They believed it was the emanations of their patron elemental, a great bound thing, which drew the lesser elementals. And the apes welcomed the opportunity to test their strength against these wild mana-constructs.

Unbeknownst to the apes, their bound elemental played them against the lesser elementals. It sought strong servitors, knowing that soon the dragons would be freed  and that it would need strong acolytes to stand against the chaos to come.

**Salamanderfolk**  In the entropic lands the Salamanderfolk spent their time in the trench-bottom ammonite cities where they built undersea cities that tapped their bound leviathans for power. Within these cities the Salamanderfolk began building laboratories where they could bring specimens from the surface for further studies.

Salamanderfolk found themselves experimenting on the likes of Lizardfolk, apes, and the lesser elementals that stalked the lands. From this came their bizarre servitors; these servitors were deployed against the Ratfolk. While the Salamanderfolk respected the creative drive of the Lizardfolk and the shamanic bent of the apes, they hated the ratfolk proclivity to horde knowledge without finding ways to apply it.

**Ratfolk**  In the entropic lands the ratfolk inhabited the plateaus where they trafficked with the demons that had been cast from their place in the ashen skies by the magic that kept the dragons bound in the cosmos. Gaining knowledge, and being fearful of the other races they hid in their plateau rats nests, accumulating knowledge without any need to apply it.

A covenant between the demon and ratfolk  knowledge in exchange for the demons protection  provided the ratfolk with the opportunity to weasel their way out of their service to the demons. Fearing that the demons would turn on them, the ratfolk found a use for their knowledge  binding the demons to a great pit within their greatest rats nest upon one of the planes most desolate plateaus. 

**Homunculi**  In the entropic lands the angels required servitors from which they could arm themselves with the strength of faith. Only through blades forged by faith could the angels slaughter the great darkness, bringing dawn to a world of night. The homunculi are observers, philosophers, and advisors that served in the courts of the apes, Salamanderfolk, ratfolk and Lizardfolk. 

Homunculi are strengthened by the unified desire of the other races: finding a better world in which to shelter against the uncertainties of the ever-changing world and the capriciousness of bound dragons, demons, elementals, angels, and leviathans. From their strength the angels, in turn, gain strength. The homunculi, though weak on their own, are reservoirs of power from which the angels will draw on the power needed to bring an end to the instability that gives the entropic lands their name.

<TEXT> **Eyes of the Cleric**

The EC's are fallen and mortally wounded soldiers repurposed to resemble the native gods of the enemy. They are not armored; their creators turn the emotions of the soldiers used - these soldiers are effectively catatonic, preserving their sense of duty, rage at their superiors, horror at what happens in war - into psionic waves that compel the enemy to bow in submission.

**Crimson Company**

The primary military force of Kargathdra, the red hand of the Crimson Regent, and the scarlet sword with which Kargathdra's industrial lords maintain their power. They include berserkers, elementalists, munitions experts, and dragonspeakers that handle the pit-dragons.

**The Stoneforged**

These are ninjalike warriors from the southernmost continent Underworld. They use illusion, conjuration, and are concerned with the procurement and preservation of knowledge. While their illusions and conjured creatures wage war, the Stoneforged recover tomes of magic, history, economics, medicine, and the arts that are in danger of being destroyed.

<TEXT> OP, I came to Elric by way of the Del Rey reprints and just...really liked the character for some reason. Maybe it was that rock-and-roll antihero flair. I'm also a fan of the larger than life character I met in a bunch of Jim Morrison biographies, so that could have something to do with it.

It could also be because I found the books relatively fast-paced compared to much of what was on the shelves. That, the dragons, elementals and demons were elements I also enjoyed.

<TEXT> The Visang Primord are five Primeval Dragons that were disgusted by the warlike ways of their kin. They hatched a plan that allowed them to use the Ifriti (created as weapons by the Primevals, then thrown away) to construct a great rig of magical energy that would decay the personality, leaving anyone exposed to it a vicious, braindead husk. The Primord effectively genocided their kin by throwing them into the rig.

Joke was on the Primord - because they eventually got chucked into the rig and came out as the five-headed mutant monstrosity that passes for my world's Tiamat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **The Crimson Company**

A mercenary unit from the jungle-continent Kargathdra, they are identified by their crimson uniforms with the slashed-eye sigil of Thunderbreak the Crimson Regent. They are split into different divisions based on speciality:

The Beast Kings - Ashen warriors trained in the art of berserking

The Space Kings - Elemental-slingers
 
The Star Kings - Mortar experts

The Demon Kings - They handle the pit dragons, including the breeding training and commanding of the pit dragons in the battlefield.

The use of "King" is in jest toward the rulers that would deploy the Crimson Company as expendable soldiers in order to maintain the rulers' reputation.

**The Sajin Monks**

The Sajin is an order of monks that hails from Eberrai, an equatorial continent serving as the heart of the Chain of Fire (lands near the equator). They're badasses because their order is known for binding the guardian spirits of the land's magical veins to themselves (in the form of intricate tattoo patterns).

The Sajin blend martial arts with magery, emphasizing mind and body existing in a state of harmony. They tend to find service the world over, using their experiences to better themselves as individuals. Continual education is their drive.

**The Reliquary Runebladers**

The Reliquary Runebladers hail from Jungko's contested interior where tribes old and new continually clash while enterprising individuals from the continent's coastal citadels attempt to manipulate the tribal warfare to their benefit.

The Runebladers are named from their runeblades - these come from the Plain of Rune where quills from a great white Primeval Dragon stand embedded in the hardpan. Within the runeblades they trap the souls of the land's deceased - turning them into pure energy, allowing the dead to have a bit of vengeance before being expended and moving on.

While the Runebladers attempt to remain neutral, they haven began to sway toward a rising ruler from the seaside citadels that promises stability and prosperity previously unrealized by the interior's folk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Orochi**

Orochi describes a human that has become host to a Yuan-Ti hatchling. Yuan-Ti have a brutish tradition where young that attempt to shed their vestigial wings are thrown out of the mountain nest. Some of these hatchlings were found by human monks and formed parasitic bonds with them, gifting them with magical strength in exchange for use of the host's physical and psychic capabilities.

With their hosts, the Orochi undertake endeavours mimicking those of the Yuan-Ti's progenitors the Primeval Dragons. Usually these blend the ambition of the great old dragons with the temperance of the Yuan-Ti.

You will know an Orochi by their outward appearance. The skin takes on a greenish coloration with bruiselike mottling. Up close you may notice something akin to psoriasis that leaves the host with diamondlike patterns across their skin. Despite their unique appearance the Orochi will usually don a cloak or robes that protect their parasitic Yuan-Ti hatchling until the point at which the hatchling integrates with the host's spinal cord. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Rig of Entropy -

A sprawling construction of igneous rock in the jungle-shrouded heart of my world's equatorial continent. Embedded in the Rig's base are fossils from the world's foundling races, which catalyzed the study of the Rig by the major monasteries and covens. 

The jungles surrounding the Rig are haunted. The ghosts of Engineers, Progenitors, and Shedders work to keep the Foreshi from mucking around with the Rig. Last time the Foreshi got access to the Rig's magical energy, it set off a big bang that accelerated evolution, turning the Foreshi into the Primevals and simultaneously giving rise to the Primordials. The ghosts remember and seek to prevent that from happening again.

The Foreshi initially fooled around with the Rig because they needed a new energy source. Their old ones had been co-opted by the Engineers and Shedders.  </TEXT>

The Dragonborn think the Yuan-Ti are spineless bitches.

The Vaku think that the Yuan-Ti and Dragonborn are extreme ends of the world's biorhythm and hire themselves out as mercenaries to both the Yuan-Ti and Dragonborn with the intent of maintaining that biorhythm.

The Yuan-Ti and Dragonborn both think the Vaku are the inbred hicks of the world.

The Ifrit believe that the Dragonborn are misguided, that the Yuan-Ti would make excellent tools, and that the Vaku are the real menace.

<TEXT> The Primeval Dragons and Primordials existed in a cosmic void after the big bang. 

Prior to the big bang, there's evidence for four Foundling species: the simian Progenitors, the amphibious Foreshi, the reptilian Shedders, and the synapsid Engineers. It is believed that the Shedders and Progenitors ganged up on the Foreshi while the Engineers attempted to remain neutral in the conflict. From this, a few esoteric religions believe, came the big bang that gave rise to the Primevals and Primordials. Similarities between the Foreshi and Primevals indicate that the Primevals arose from the Foreshi. The Primordials seem to be an amalgam of the Progenitors and Shedders achieved by the Engineers' skills in manipulating their primeval world's elements.

As the Primevals and Primordials slugged it out over territory and energy sources, the debris from their fights came together to form the actual world for my setting, Flamedroi where remnants of the Foundlings looked on at the great cosmic wars between the Primordials and Primevals.

From the Primevals came scales, shed, that gave rise to the Regents (a lesser race of dragons) with the intent that the Regents would keep watch over the surviving Foundlings. Cany Primevals feared that the Foundlings would find a way to help the Primordials put an end to them. 

A select few Primevals attempted to make peace with the Foundlings. Unfortunately, the vicious Foreshi tricked the peaceful Primevals into believing that they would need to brainwash the violence out of the warlike Primevals. This triggered further infighting among the surviving Foundlings. In the end, an Engineer stepped up to construct a massive rig that would harness the chaotic energy thrown off by the fighting between Primeval and Primordial. Into this rig the peaceful Primevals began casting their kin; from it emerged wingless Pit-Dragons (yet another race of dragons just beneath Regents) cursed with vicious, bestial temperaments. 

The Shedders, seeing themselves reflected in the Pit-Dragons, turned on the peaceful Primevals and began studying elementalism with the intent on beating the Primevals at their own game. A newly emerged race, the Yuan-Ti - terrified of the Primevals, convinced the peacelike Primevals to casting their warmaking kindred into the same rig as had birthed the Pit-Dragons. This didn't go as planned - from the rig came a viciously stupid five-headed draconic monstrosity known as Tiamat. A Shedder skilled in elementalism emerged to fight against Tiamat - this Shedder is known as Bahamut. So Tiamat and Bahamut fought and the world began developing its own magical defense mechanisms against the two factions.

In the end the Primevals were hunted to extinction by the Foreshi and the Yuan-Ti. During this time mankind's ancestors emerged as well from the Progenitor lineage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Yuan-Ti suffer from PTSD induced by the fighting between the Primevals and Primordials. It was made worse when the Yuan-Ti attempted to end the fighting, inadvertently created Tiamat, and kicked off a war between Tiamat and Bahamut. They've since sought isolation and would rather act in impish defiance of the Primeval Dragons, blaming them for their state of existence.

The various underworld elements are driven be a desire to not go back to the impoverished existence from which they came...or they despise the underhanded dealings of the industrial heights from which they fell and believe their mobster work is more honest.

<TEXT> It depends on your preference in terms of foreshadowing. I'm not a fan of foreshadowing with all the subtlety of a brick to the head. The books have given us evidence that Jon is a dragon/Targaryen. We have Dany Targaryen. Two dragons, with a prior event called the "Dance of Dragons." That's my kind of foreshadowing - its there, but without too much in the way of flashing neon lights telling you in all-caps what's going to happen.

I could be entirely wrong - we'll know when we have the book in our hands. I imagine Aegon will butt heads with Dany or Euron depending on how well he has consolidated his powerbase by the time these two become bigger threats. There's far more moving pieces in play that we must needs consider before writing off any of our theories as definitively wrong. Especially when these theories are taken from textual evidence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a couple of dreams in ADWD, one where Dany's fighting the Usurper's dogs at the Trident...except they're made of ice...and one where Jon dreams of beheading Rob, usurping him as Lord of Winterfell.

That's where I got the idea. Thematically speaking, I think it makes sense for Aegon to step up and clean up the debris from the Jon v Dany Dance of Dragons. Aegon, likely Faegon, is a bastard of no notable birth or heritage, yet could be the one to unite commoner and lord alike against a greater threat.

I feel that Dany vs Aegon is too blunt for GRRM. Too telegraphed, if you will, given the historical basis for the Dance of Dragons. Euron is the wild card, but then he may also ultimately end up on team Ice given the TWOW sample chapter "The Forsaken." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yuan-Ti, long ago, made it a tradition to remove their fireglands in defiance of the Primeval Dragons with whom they share a lineage. In place of these they developed psionic venom glands that amplify their prey's feelings of anxiety and guilt, rendering their prey a blubbering sack of bones and blood. 

Dragonborn, seeking to adapt to the shifting climates, developed a technique that allowed them to conceal themselves in loose folds of skin magicked to give them a humanlike appearance. It hid them from their natural predators, the Yuan-Ti. In general, dragonborn magic is more focused around seizing power through subtler means ie persuasion than their Primeval ancestors that used might alone.

Navajko, the ancestors of mankind, focused their magic around the natural world ie taking on the bestial characteristics of the furred dragons of the northern frontiers to survive the ice age. Along with this transformative skinshifting magic came an affinity for the natural world - not the ability to conjure elementals, but rather than ability to conjure beasts in the likeness of various mythical houndlike creatures.

Went to a chinese buffet with a lovely asian and her african american friend. Dude and his girl that looked like your textbook SJW had the booth near ours. We heard a noise from the kitchen that sounded like power tools.  Asian says she's kinda worried - and the aa chick says yeah, you know what they say about asian places. Both laughed.

<TEXT> Not IOIs. I don't think a lady would invite you into her apartment if she weren't interested on some level. Anywho, I ended up there to borrow something since she'd put that out a while back. She invites me in, chats me up a bit and is pretty open the whole time, keeps the convo going. Whole time it feels like she's eyeing me up and down. Its kind of awkward tbh.

<TEXT> Yep - Sundered Worlds was the first title; it was retitled later. Same happened with Phoenix in Obsidian - that one got reprinted later as "The Silver Warriors." I preferred PiO myself...if you want to continue with those edition, you'll want the Von Bek omnibus. The third novel in that one is TDITS. However, Titan Books has been reprinting most of Moorcock's Eternal Champion novels in the US. Del Rey did the Elric series for the US.

Cameron's Avatar kind of reminded me of The Eternal Champion, so you've got that at least. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Real world concept; the idea of I can take risks and push forward, or play it safe and let my failures define me.

In world:

Naga - the ultimate embodiment of stagnation; they'd rather rage at the Primeval Dragons for the Primevals' past transgressions (Very violent, but why get stuck in the past?) than push forward. Their rage, or stagnation, is manifest in their tradition of surgically crippling their hatchlings' vestigial wings, leaving those in place as a kind of taunt toward the Primevals. Hatchlings that fight against this get thrown off the mountain. Stagnation at its worst.

Dragonborn - the ultimate embodiment of generativity; they'd rather develop advanced camouflage systems that would let them experience the world and pursue their passions with an ends-justify-the-means fuck the methodology approach. This means that others, willingly or unwillingly, often get used by the Dragonborn in their pursuit of their passions. The ultimate extreme in generativity.

Humans - Cultural differences aside, tend to be united in the fact that they can strike a balance between the two extremes, or shift toward one or the other. Unlike the Naga and Dragonborn they use logic to justify or excuse their decisions. </TEXT>

Those aren't humans.

Those are dragonborn. The leathers aren't clothes - those are folds of skin adapted to help them retain the sun's heat. The humanlike appearance? Come on now, you've seen anoles change from green to brown haven't you? Yeah, its something like that.

Why are they hiding?

Well, if your natural predators preferred to hide in the jungle-mountains but could control thralls via psionic parasites, you'd want the camouflage too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Untitled

Once the Navajko beastfolk, pushed into a corner by the Sajin monks, retreated to a ziggurat wherein they found a legendary jitte. With the jitte and a bit of magic they created a ninety-nine headed hydra. The hydra became the Navajko weapon against the Sajin monks.

The hydra rampaged and the Sajin killed it. Unbeknownst to the Sajin the hydra was a dirty bomb - it released a combination of chemicals that exploded the Sajin monks' lungs, turning their corpses into cultures for fungi and bacteria that, together, created an atmosphere hostile to human lungs but perfect for the Navajko lungs.

And so from this came the Green Inferno, a realm now broken, which is said to pass through the realm of the living every full moon. </TEXT>

Rough List

**Pokemon**

3 Charizard Ex

1 M Charizard Ex (Generations) - I don't intend on going further than locals, so I threw this in for Jolteon Exs.

4 Entei (Ancient Origins)

1 Druddigon (Flashfire)

2 Shaymin Ex (Roaring Skies)

**Supporters:**

4 Blacksmith

2 Lysandre

1 Giovanni's Scheme

3 Professor Juniper

**Stadium:**

3 Scorched Earth

**Items:**

4 Ultra Ball

4 VS Seeker

4 Trainer's Mail

2 Fighting Fury Belt

3 Muscle Band

3 Battle Compressor

1 Float Stone

1 Scramble Switch

1 Professor's Letter

**Energy:**

4 DCE

9 Fire Energy

*

I was thinking Druddigon might be good tech vs EXs.

My Trainers are focused around supporting CHEX as the main attacker, though there's plenty of versatility here that Entei can easily come in and start wrecking it.

The Supporters are where I think I need the most help. Maximizing the tools available and all.  </TEXT>

Seriously.

200X, I was at a brick and mortar in Panama City Beach and saw a copy of Del Rey's Elric: The Stealer of Souls. Gorgeous Picacio cover. The back blurb was just as intriguing as the cover art. Boom, purchased.

These volumes are some of the most dog-eared books on my shelf. </TEXT>

I really enjoyed both the Suicide Squad movie and the John Ostrander comics from the 80's-90's. Are there any fantasy series that have a similar feel or concept?

I've read the Black Company, R.A. Salvatore's Sellswords Trilogy (Jarlaxle and Entreri-centric trilogy, fantastic if you've ever been curious about Salvatore) and Malazan, which are the only ones I'm aware of. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I heard this from a girl's friend last weekend. We were out on the town with a group to celebrate something or another. The girl was our designated driver. Her friend was shitfaced drunk and blurted this out while I was with the friend and her S.O. (if you're curious, the shitfaced friend wanted to hit some local burger joint later that night)

My question for the women of reddit - is would you show this kind of...deference, respect or what have you, to someone that you simply considered a friend? The fact that it came from the girl's friend - while said friend was drunk - kind of got me wondering about that.

I wanted to ask because, anytime you hear something from guys with girl friends (as opposed to girlfriends) there's a touch of the friendzone salt there...I wasn't sure if a girl that simply considered you a friend would show that sort of deference or agreeability.

TL;DR:

One of her drunk girlfriends said that she likes me and would do anything I asked - what's that mean? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A few months ago I found out by way of this girl's friend that the girl likes me ("ask her if we can go to Chipotle, she'll do whatever you say!"). I'm not sure just what that entails, but she'd always be down to let me borrow odds/ends and was usually happy to drive me to the bar for parties and stuff. In return I did a bit of housesitting for her, but that's it.


Career stuff kept me occupied for a couple of months. Here recently she showed up at my place to get me to help her with her truck (saying she didn't know anyone else in our apartments). We shot the breeze afterward - it was a bit awkward; I eventually ended the convo with "well, I've gotta go get some work done," to which she replies: "Well, hey, it seems like I'm always coming over here to get your help. If you need anything just come on up. My door's always open."

I'm not sure if there's anything in here to say she's interested in anyway other than purely platonic. Your thoughts, vet sedditors? </TEXT>

She likes you, she'll do whatever you ask!" So I did, and over the course of the night [30/f] kinda hung all over me/got a little touch (nothing inappropriate).

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm aware of the Entei / Charizard Ex deck. It seems like the engine of Blacksmith + Battle Compressor would be a good foundation around which to build. Going by the Primer at the top of the page, I'll be using Tiernos in lieu of Shaymin Ex, recognizing that I'm not getting the best draw power that I could.

However

It also seems like building an Expanded Format deck with the Mega Charizard Ex box Promo Charizard might be better. You're doing 150 a turn at the cost of discarding a single energy. Thoughts on the staples I should include in an Expanded deck focusing around a Charizard requiring 5 energy for 150 damage?

I realize that Charizard Ex is a better deck, but I wanted to build something more traditional. </TEXT>

To my surprise, she goes for the seat next to me rather than the empty one on the end of the row...

There's been a couple of times when she'll ask me about something from the lecture, or if I've done ____ yet. Strange, because there's plenty of people seated to either side that she could ask instead of me.

Being that I'm not used to girls that act nervous, I'm not exactly sure how to read them. Is this the norm for nervous girls that you might have a shot with? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Your Prehistoric Races? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-24 03:44:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Let's post our prehistoric races. Maybe yours are entirely extinct, maybe they're in hiding...either way, post em here.

Mine existed amidst the great struggle between the Primordials and Primevals in a realm whose name translates to "Chance." They were mostly neglected by these two great forces of chaos - left to their own devices, mostly, except for the Forerunners - for it was the Forerunners from which the first Primevals came...

Chance is a land without rules where might makes right. Much of the sky is covered by ashes spewed from the multitude of volcanoes while steaming jungles dominate a savage land populated by four foundling races and a variety of deadly wildlife, including elementals of fire, stone, tar, moss and fungi, the fiery magliz, the reptilian insectoid scydon, crocodiles, the hybrid reptilian/mammalian kangi, and the sabretoothed stormbreakers. 


**The Progenitors**  A race of great apes from which mankind is descended. They are tall, with broad frames and a lean, muscular build. Life in the darklands of Chance has given them a vicious temperament and a pale complexion beneath their coverings of matted brown fur. While the shaman of the race study the entropic magic of the realm, the warriors of the race use the violent nature of the realm to their advantage through necromancy; the warriors also strengthen themselves against the planes microscopic predators by indulging in the blood of those they best in battle  they believe that this practice will bolster their immune system against the diseases one may encounter in the dark, swampy regions of the realm.

The Progenitors were born from the burnwillow groves early in the planes history; they consider themselves the planes response to the Forerunners and their dragon descendants that dominated the plane.


**The Forerunners**  A race of reptilian creatures that emerged from the tar-filled bayous of Chance. They are stocky with long, thick necks ending into tusked snouts filled with lamprey-like teeth; their pale flesh is protected by a natural bonelike armor that develops when they reach maturity. The Forerunners are an atavistic race united in their three-pronged attack style: strip their prey of defenses magical and mundane, engage in magical battle where necessary, and then go for the kill after the opponent has been left vulnerable.

Forerunners are the first sentient, sapient species to emerge on Chance; they crawled out of the rivers of burning tar found in the more mountainous regions. The first dragons emerged from the Forerunners that went into the mountains and cast themselves into the Entropy Storms encircling the ranges at the heart of Chance. Where the Entropy Storms decayed the Forerunners, the extreme heat in the fiery calderas triggered explosive events from which the scattered subatomic particles of the Forerunners were reconfigured into the form of massive winged and scaled reptilians  the hellkites.

**The Engineers**  A race of squat, broad-shouldered green-scaled humanoids related to the Progenitors; whereas the Progenitors are more militant in nature, the Engineers have embraced a life of asceticism in the less volatile bayous of Chance. As the Progenitors become more militarized, the Engineers have sent their oozes to scavenge the battlefields for Progenitors  warriors and shaman alike  lingering at deaths doorstep; from these broken Progenitors the Engineers create legions of half-Progenitor half-fungi Entromancers that harness the natural forces of decay rather than the magical forces of decay used by the Progenitor shaman.

The Engineers were born from the mossy boulders of the ravines that they call home. They thus have an inborn talent for elementalism, often waking elementals from the magically-charged boulders of the ravine in defense of their homes.

**The Splitters** - A race of orange-scaled lizards that live exclusively in the Entropy Storms. They attract the broken, scattered particles of sacrifices made to the volcanoes in the Entropy Storm and recombine the particles in the hornlike fireglands that sweep back from their elongated skulls. From there the fragments experience a final breakdown before being spat out as fire in duels between rival Splitters; this releases the decayed remains of the sacrifices to the fires smoldering beneath the Entropy Storms. From these come reconfigured lifeforms based on the initial sacrifice.

Splitters resemble dragons, but lack the ability to control the thunder and lightning of Chances thunderheads. Whereas dragons are more biological in nature, the Splitters are more elemental in nature, beings of pure fire wrapped in a scaly hide. While dragons tend toward intelligent yet feral, the Splitters are more relaxed, often becoming agitated only in the most extreme of circumstances. Their relaxed nature prevents the Splitters from drawing the attention of the dragons  because the dragons are one of the few creatures to prey on mature Splitters. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started reading these things in undergrad. They were quick, mostly enjoyable breaks from the rigors of chemistry. I've come across a few really good ones and a load of really bad ones. Let's focus on the positives and list our favorites, be they series or individual books.

The Brotherhood of the Griffin books one through three by Richard Lee Byers

I loved the concept of a mercenary battlemage, so Aoth Fezim quickly became one of my favorite DnD characters. These first three explored a region in the Forgotten Realms called Chessenta and dealt heavily with the Cult of the Dragon. In particular, I especially liked the scene where Chessenta's ruler, a Red Dragon, demanded that a priest of Lathander keep the sun from setting. It was hilariously absurd, yet also slightly terrifying because the Red Dragon had been doing a bad job of keeping his Shade-induced PTSD in check.

<TITLE> Dragonborn as a Species </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-20 15:21:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My goal in designing the Dragonborn is to present my players with a species that is a touch alien, yet still somewhat understandable. 

**The Dragonborn**

The Dragonborn believe that they came about to serve the cause of Entropy. Their earliest records reveal a chaotic world in which Primordials forever warred with one another over petty differences, likely their peers criticism of their geographic creations, while Primevals seemingly mirrored them, albeit in the cosmic expanses above the fledgling world. Amid the chaos is a distinct lack of decay necessary to maintain the worlds stability  without the threat of Entropy, the dragonborn are left without their most essential source of sustenance: emotions.

**Physiology**

Dragonborn history teaches that they sprang from the scales of Primevals, shed, that took over elementals of fire, nature, and rot.  These scales redirected their hosts magical machinery to the development of the fledgling dragonborn. At maturation the dragonborn emerge from their hosts, consuming the remains of the elementals. From these the dragonborn derive the nutrients needed to activate nodes throughout their bodies that contribute to their affinity for magic.

Dragonborn are best described as empathetic vampires that gain sustenance from the emotions of other sentient beings in their vicinity. 

Dragonborn are comprised of three races based on their fire glands and nutritional needs: Rot, Blood, Vital.

*Purger Dragonborn* possess a breath weapon that exerts a subtle influence, cutting through the psychic shields of their prey to exploit the preys fears and deep, unspoken desires. These Dragonborn believe that their ability to bring these less wholesome qualities to the surface in their prey is ultimately holistic, purging their beings of things that would eventually poison them if left to fester.

*Ignite Dragonborn* possess a breath weapon that ignites the harmless, if slightly hedonistic, passions of their prey: be it artistry magical, martial, painting or sculpting.

*Awakener Dragonborn* possess a breath weapon that triggers genotypic and phenotypic changes in their prey; from the abundance of new life that these changes bring about in the prey the Vital Dragonborn derive their sustenance. 

Dragonborn reproduction is violent by human standards. During the height of the Blood Moon the Dragonborn migrate to a particular island inhabited almost exclusively by primordial elementals. Here they select a primordial elemental and engage it in mixed magical martial arts combat. There are two outcomes to the combat ritual:

The Dragonborn may lose, in which case the primordial elemental leaves a fragment of itself in the dragonborns corpse. From this fragment hatches a new primordial elemental that gains sustenance from the Dragonborn corpses vitals.

The Dragonborn may win, in which case they shed scales into the primordial elementals wounds. While all of the scales reach the fetal stage, only the most dominant will emerge from the host as a fully developed Dragonborn. As such, the Dragonborn have no concept of family.

**Personality**

The Dragonborn are the consummate hedonists that travel the world in pursuit of their pleasures. On their own the Dragonborn are impersonal and dont tend to form relationships beyond that of predator to prey. As a chameleon may change colors to blend in with its background the Dragonborn may feign sympathy and empathy in order to remain close to their prey or to gain access to whatever has become the object of their desire. These desires can run the gamut from warlord to mercenary to political advisor to assassin to honorable champion to shaman or to druid.

At the core of the Dragonborn philosophy of hedonism is a belief that the Dragonborn of the ages after the death of the Primevals by their offspring are reincarnations of those slain Primevals. In keeping with their belief that the world exists within a system of thermodynamics, they are the Primevals reincarnated for a new age.

While they possess breath weapons, the Dragonborn primarily rely on physical prowess and their ability to create tools from the world metals. It isnt uncommon to find a Dragonborn that specializes in the production of bullets, firearms, shriekblades, swords, or defensive weapons such as jittes. In the case of non-automatic weapons, the Dragonborn will imbue the metal with the essence of a slain elemental. This lends the weapon magical properties without requiring the Dragonborn to use magic directly. A few Dragonborn even imbue their bullets with elemental magic, effectively creating firearms that allow them to mimic the breath weapons of the Primevals.

<TITLE> Base Set - Rocket League Deck - Charizard and Friends </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys and gals. My friends and I are gonna run a funsies league that simulates the pokemon league we used to play in. We're using Base Set to Team Rocket as our cardpool. Since this simulates WOTC's run of the TCG, Bill and Comp Search are not counted as Supporters.

I'm trying to put together the best Charizard-themed deck that I can with these rules. Charmeleon was a really good attacker back then, so I'm not running any Pokemon Breeders. Otherwise...here's what I have:

Pokemon - 18

4 Charmander - Base Set

3 Charmeleon - Base Set

3 Charizard - Base Set

4 Magmar - Fossil

3 Electabuzz - Base Set

1 Scyther - Jungle

Trainers - 22

4 Bill

3 Professor Oak

3 Computer Search

2 Item Finder

2 Lass

3 Plus Power

2 Gust of Wind

2 Switch

1 Energy Retrieval


Energy: 20

10 Fire Energy

6 Electric Energy

4 Double Colorless Energy

Back in my league days I was playing the boring old Haymaker deck. For this league, I decided to do something a little more fun than the same old. Charizard was my MVP as a kid, so I wanted a nostalgic build that uses him in as competitive a way as is possible. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Cook's Dread Empire or Barclay's Chronicles of the Raven </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-11 04:18:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm looking for something quick and enjoyable. I've read Malaz and the Black Company. I loved both of them, so now I'm looking at either the Dread Empire reprints or the Chronicles of the Raven by Barclay.

Some fantasies I've read and enjoyed are Dark Tower, Vlad Taltos, A Land Fit for Heroes, Twilight Reign, Elric Saga, Dusk/Dawn, Broken Empire/Red Queen's War, First Law and its standalones.

I've read the first novels from Farseer, Stormlight Archives, Dragonlance Chronicles/Legends, Kingkiller Chronicles and Death Gate and didn't find myself compelled to continue with these series.

I figured this brief look at what I liked vs didn't like would help you in pointing me toward one of these two series. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey peeps. So I'm calling this impromptu because I didn't intend to actually do any pickup tonight. It just sorta happened.

Long and short of it is, went to get some Deathstroke comics, wearing a Suicide Skwad tee, go to pay for them. There's no other customers up there. Cashier asks if I've seen the movie. We start chatting about it, the comics, Dawn of Justice. I close it off with a "Hey - love to continue this conversation; we should get a drink sometime."

And got the legit digits. Easy peasy. </TEXT>

4 Simian Spirit Guide

4 Goblin Rabblemaster

3 Hanweir Garrison

1 Rakka Mar

<TITLE> A Successful Close? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'll be frank here - I hit the local lounges looking for a side chick. Hit it off pretty good with a couple, quite a few rejections but hey - ya live and learn there. One of my closes ended with the potential side chick giving me her # (double checked, its legit), telling me to hit her up if I ever wanted to grab a drink.

Would you say that was a close I could chalk up as a success? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Shards of Modern </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We know the players like to name their 3-color decks after the shards. Of all the shard decks in the Modern format, which is the weakest?

I'd say Bant. It has the trick with Knight of the Reliquary and Coralhelm whatsitsname that lets you scry and give a creature flying. Otherwise, Naya and Jund do it better. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Interpreting Textgame in Context </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-03 02:26:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Context: I think there might be something worth exploring with this girl I know. A while back after I met her, I'd plan stuff with her via text. Mine were pretty barebones; her replies were a bit lengthier than my texts. A couple of times, she'd contact me out of the blue to tell me about a social event and ask if I'd be there.

At the time I was pretty focused on my career/work, so I'd say "yeah, I'll be there," and leave it at that. I'd go, have fun, she once invited me out to a local nightclub with her. Laughed at some jokes and even excused me for being kind of an ass to this one guy that, well, everyone in our circle's kinda been an ass to.

Couple of weeks later there's a major shakeup in my personal life related to my career. We were out, she comes up chats a bit, says she's glad for the changes I'm making to work around this shakeup and tells me it all happens for a reason.

Month ago I shot her text - "Hey, let's get drinks on ____" to which she replied, "We're going to New York this weekend!" When I got the reply, I figured "oh well, ya tried," and went on about my business. 

Next day I saw in snapchat where she and her crew actually did go to New York, so it didn't seem like a white lie intended as a friendly letdown.

This brings me to the present day - about a month since I invited her to grab drinks. I was thinking about shooting her a text to see if she'd wanna catch a movie. Something like, "Hey, I'm gonna catch suicide squad on ______ - care to come?"

Based on the context given, would you say this is an appropriate, simple and open form of textgame to start a bit of pickup?

<TITLE> Applied Innuendos </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm the guy that called himself lunkheaded. Scored a date, here's the gist:

So we went bowling.

-Talked about plans for Fall; said she decided to do classes in my current city rather than back in hers

-Asked about where I'm staying; kinda got wide-eyed when I gave her the figures on rent. She said something like "Geez, you really slapped me in the face with that one!" Laughed afterwards.

-We grabbed coffee at the alley's cafe; noticed she was rubbing her neck/clavicle/collar bone area while we chatted.

Whatcha think Master PUAs - safe to do some risque flirting/innuendo?

<TEXT> So offsite I've made my way into the ranks of the Hillary shills. In discussing Hillary with the shills and her supporters, I refer to her as Hilldog and my posts about Hillary are loaded with emphasis on her negatives, albeit disguised JUST enough to fool the shills.

Am I doing this nimble navigation thing right? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Kinda Lunkheaded, Need Advice </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-29 06:15:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So in the past I've been pretty dense. In retrospect I've known at least a couple of girls that were interested. At the time I was so focused on getting my career/lifegoals in order that I completely missed their signs.

Anyway, I've noticed that this woman I'm currently talking to:

Cracks grins and laughs at my jokes/remarks (nothing overly loud, more like chuckles I guess)
Touches me on the leg to get my attention
Always calls instead of texts; even for really simple things like setting up meetings.
Usually sits with her body kinda open to me.

So, I was wondering if these little things might mean there's something worth looking into.
