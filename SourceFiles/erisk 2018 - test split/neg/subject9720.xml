<TEXT> I married my husband exactly one week after my nineteenth birthday.  Marcus was, as my step-father Jedidiah Bell had repeatedly told me, a good match for me.  He was a member of the same congregation that my Step-father was pastor of.  His most defining qualities were that he was near my age and unmarried.  Jedidiah made it very clear that, as the head of the household, he was perfectly capable of finding me a God fearing husband.

My stepfather had married my widowed mother when I was fourteen.  He came into our life like a showman; Jedidiah was larger than life in almost every way.  Large stomach, large smile; and large beliefs about how wives and stepdaughters should treat the new man of the house.  

Please Greta, just make sure you do as he says, he means everything to me, my mother pleaded with me.  The pain and desperation in her face was enough to convince me. Just to see her happy again was enough. At least it had been.

I had not interacted much with Marcus before our fast engagement and hasty church wedding on a sweltering day in May.  He was always in khakis or faded blue jeans, complete with a button down shirt every Sunday morning, sandwiched between his parents and siblings.  I had known that he was a mechanic and despite what I had assume were frequent showers the smell of machine oil always lingered.  He never smiled.  His eyes had always seemed cold to me despite the warm shade of blue they contained.  

Shortly after we were married, he took a job as a mechanic at a shop that was an hour away from where we were currently living, which was in my old bedroom while we looked for a home.  I was actually happy to be leaving my stepfather and mother behind.  I loved my mother, but she had become a timid and quiet thing. Not like the mother I remembered from when my father was still alive.  As Jedidiah would say with his wide toothed smile, a wife had to do what was best for her husband, which meant obeying without question. 

My own job was simple, I was a receptionist at a dentist office, but I loved it there.  I had no other education besides my high school diploma and started my job right after school. My co-workers were so kind.  I cried as I turned in my two weeks notice.  They gave me a small farewell party complete with cake and wine and told me to keep in touch.

The move was fast since I had very little to move to our new home.  I could fit all of my clothes in a small and battered suitcase that was older than I was.  The rest of my possessions fit into a cardboard box.  I loaded up my car with my things and set out for what I hoped was a brighter future.  I stopped only once to gather groceries, as I knew it would be up to me to make lunch and dinner that night.

The home that we were renting was an old one.  When I first lay eyes on it, my heart sank.  I could already envision the old Formica counters and thread bare carpets.  It looked like it was barely hanging together.  Marcus was silent with me as we moved in our things, though he did make conversation with his brothers and relatives who had come to haul in the heavier furniture. 
 
I busied myself with unpacking the kitchen as quickly as I could so that I could start making lunch for everyone.  I approached Marcus as he was carrying a box into the master bedroom.

What would you like to eat for lunch sweetheart?  That term of endearment sounded so false on my tongue I nearly choked.  He was my husband, not my sweetheart.

Marcus paused long enough to give me a harsh glare. I withered under that gaze and looked down.

Just make some fried chicken, youre good at that. And mashed potatoes, He said gruffly as he turned away to store the box in the bedroom.

I hurried to make the requested fried chicken and mashed potatoes.  I was thankful that I had stopped at the grocery store to gather supplies.  Fried chicken would be easy to make and fulling for the men as they fixed up the house.  

The lunch was ready just as the last cardboard box found its way into the house.  I served everyone at the table while Marcus led us in prayer.  My step-father and my mother were not present.  As my Step-father did not like to travel and my mother was rarely able to go anywhere without her husband.

It was up to Marcus to say the blessings before we could begin to eat our meal.  I had also misjudged how hungry everyone would be, the men devoured chicken as fast as I set it on the table.  By the time I was able to sit down and join everyone there was only a small piece left.  One of Marcuss brothers saw that I had nothing for myself and insisted that I take the last bit of meat.  I ate it happily, though I saw Marcus glaring at me out of the corner of my eye and I wondered with a jolt of fear what I had done wrong.

After everyone had left I found out why Marcus had glared at me. While I was cleaning up the table he grabbed my forearm roughly and squeezed it hard, digging in his nail which were crusted with dirt.

I whimpered slightly but stopped myself from jerking away as I knew it would only make it worse.

He looked into my eyes and spoke in a low and angry voice.  Why didnt you make sure that you had enough food for everyone? You humiliated me. My brother shouldnt have to give up food so that you can stuff yourself. You did nothing all day while we all worked.

I stuttered, biting back a retort, realizing it would not do any good.  Im so sorry Marcus, this Sunday Ill make everyone lunch. I can make enough for everyone to make up for today.

I grimaced as his grip on my arm increased, and I was sure that his dirty nails would were breaking the skin.  With one last hard squeeze he let me go and set back in his chair.

I think that would make up for it. But make sure you ask proper forgiveness from my brother and everyone else that helped with today.

I nodded numbly, not yet daring to move away from him.  He gave me one last withering glare and set off to the garage.  Most likely to arrange his tools in the small space.  After he was out of sight I gingerly rubbed my forearm

A nasty bruise was already starting to form.  There were little half-moon marks where his nails had dug into my arm.  I wasnt sure how I would hide my bruises as I had a job interview tomorrow.  It was for another receptionist job.  It would not be much but it would grant me at least some autonomy away from my husband. 
 
I wrapped my arm in a dish towel that I had dipped in cold water.  After that I took extra care to wash the dishes and make sure that the kitchen was as clean as possible.  I winced when I heard Marcus come in from the garage a few hours later.  I was still straightening up the bedroom and putting clothes away when he came to bed.  He didnt say anything to me, or even look at me. He turned on our bedroom TV and watched the local television until he fell asleep.  

It was only after he had fallen asleep that I felt safe enough to lay down next to him and fall asleep.  I stayed there, as quiet as possible while he snored beside me and waited for sleep to take me.  

The interview the next morning went incredibly well.  I had opted to wear a long sleeve silk blouse to cover my bruised arm.  I was hired on the spot as they had been desperate for a new receptionist with previous experience.  Plus I had nothing but glowing reviews from my previous job.  I was excited.  This job gave me time away from home and my own money, plus benefits. 

I went home after the interview feeling optimistic.  I would have called and told Marcus and my mother about the new job but I didnt have a cell phone.  My husband would hear about the job once he got home that night.

For dinner I made meatloaf and arranged the table as nicely as possible.  There was still a knot of fear in my stomach as I lay out the food for our meal.  If something was not to Marcuss liking I didnt want to risk getting another bruise.

He arrived just as I set the meatloaf on the table, I looked up at him as he entered and tried to force a smile.  He didnt look at me but headed straight to the kitchen to wash his hands of their persistent grease.

After the blessing he ate in silence, wolfing down his food and going in for seconds.  I took the opportunity to try and start a conversation.

How was your job today? I asked, trying to keep my tone light and pleasant.  I was rewarded with a glare.

I dont want to talk while Im eating, he said as he swallowed another bite.  I nodded and looked down, not wanting to do anything to provoke him

After dinner he went into the garage and stayed there until bedtime, never even bothering to say another word to me. I preferred it that way. 

While we lay down for bed I finally told him that I had gotten the job.  He rolled over and gave me what probably amounted to a pleased look.  

Its good that you got the job. Make sure you deposit everything in the joint account. As the man of the house I will make sure to give you an allowance to cover gas.  And with that he rolled over and went straight to sleep.

I said nothing but I let a few silent tears roll down my cheek in the dark.  Any autonomy I had hoped to have would be gone now.  I should just run away, I told myself in a brief spark of defiance.  I could pack everything in my truck and just drive as far as I could.  But how far would I get with no money?  My truck needed gas and I would need food. There were no friends I could turn to, and my own mother was out of the question.  I was alone.

The next say was a Saturday and Marcus was off work.  Marcus pinched me awake at dawn to go make breakfast.  I rushed to make it, anything to get away from those bruising pinches.  
Since it was a Saturday I knew he might work on his own truck today or mow the lawn.  It would give me time to myself and decorate the inside of the house.  While I was making a list of groceries to get while I was out later that day, I saw Marcus coming out of our room with a handful of my clothes.

Marcus, what are you doing with my clothes?  He stopped and looked at me, fixing me with those cold eyes.

These shirts arent decent, you should only be wearing long sleeved shirts or dresses.  He held up the few t-shirts that I actually owned.  Some of them were plain cotton Ts, the others were nice ones that I wore to work when it was hot.

Im going to turn these into rags. I could use some for my garage.  He glared at me again almost daring me to fight him. I shrunk back from his gaze.

But, if you take those shirts I wont have much to wear for work.  Ill have to go buy some long sleeved tops somewhere.  I said pleadingly.

I hated myself in that moment.  I should have slapped him then, taken my things and run away.  Money and marriage be damned.  Sleeping on the street would be better than this.

But I didnt move, I stayed glued to the spot staring at the floor because I was too afraid to make eye contact with the man I married.

Marcus sighed and threw my clothes to the ground, pulled out his wallet and handed me a creased 20 dollar bill.  I took it with trembling fingers.

There is probably a Goodwill somewhere in this town. You can get yourself some clothes there, and give me back the change.
I nodded and stuffed the bill into my purse while he took my clothes into the garage.  I left as soon as the door closed behind him, grabbing the grocery list as I went.  I did not want to be around him while he destroyed my things.  

Once I was on the road I started crying.  I wiped my face angrily, tears werent going to be doing me any good.  Instead I set out trying to find a Goodwill or some other kind of thrift shop.  It turned out my new town had none of these things and I was starting to give up hope of finding any cheap clothing.  I would have to settle for the local Target and hope for a sale.

As I was thinking this I saw on side of the road a small yellow sign proudly proclaiming Yard Sale! On 505 Turner Street! someone had even tied a pink balloon to it to attract attention. I smiled, I had forgotten about yard sales.  It was a warm Saturday and there would probably be a ton of them.  I might be able to find some clothes.

I turned into the side street and it didnt take me long to find the yard sale.  It looked like a large one.  There were at eight cars lined up on the side of the street, and at least a dozen people were examining tables filled with second hand goods.

It had to have been one of the bigger yard sales I had seen, it looked like they were clearing out the entire house.  I spotted what I had been hoping to find, clothes were carefully arranged on a pole suspended between two trees.

I parked my truck and walked over, happy to see that the clothes were womens clothing.  I browsed through the shirts and pants. I could tell they had belonged to an older woman, but they were all in great shape and some things still had tags on them.  I settled on five new tops.  They were all long sleeved and looked conservative enough for both work and my husbands tastes.
I tucked my finds under my arm and fished out the 20 dollars Marcus had given me.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a box that had been placed under the clothes titled Miscellaneous with a tiny doll poking out of it.  

It was entirely nondescript and devoid of features, like a rag doll.  It had tiny red stitches for eyes and a mouth. The fabric looked like some kind of faded linen.  I squished its belly hoping to find out what was stuffed with, and whatever its insides were composed of rolled around.  Maybe it was filled with dried beans?  The tiny doll looked at me in what I thought was an expression of curiosity, which was not possible as it hardly any features at all.  In some ways it reminded me of Oogie Boogie from my favorite child hood film. 

I held on to the tiny doll, it wouldnt hurt to ask how much it was.  The woman who was running the yard sale was sitting at a small table under the shade of a large tree.  She was dressed in a sleeveless bright pink top with white shorts, all of which complemented her dark colored skin.

When she looked up she smiled warmly and gestured to what I was holding.  Is that all for you honey? She asked with a pleasant voice.

I nodded and lay the shirts down on the table so she could count them.  Its gonna be 10 bucks for all the shirts honey, do you need a bag to carry them?

Yes, thank you, I answered.  I held up the tiny doll for her to see.  How much would you like for this little doll?

She reached for it and I let her take it, she gave it a small squeeze and let out a tiny laugh.
  I remember this little thing! My mom bought it when we took a trip down to New Orleans, about, oh20 years ago?  She always said she wanted an authentic voodoo doll  

I looked at the doll in surprise.  So this little doll, its really a voodoo doll?  I had never seen one in real life before.  If Marcus found out that I had even touched it he would be upset.

She set it down with the clothes and gave it a thoughtful look.  Oh yes, my mom was adamant that she get a real one. She didnt want any fake tourist souvenir.  That was the last trip we all took together as a family. It wasnt long afterwards that my father passed away from a heart attack.  She sighed and made a sweeping motion with her hand to encompass the yard sale.  All of this is because my mom died last month.  Its up to me to make sure everything gets sold off.

 Im so sorry to hear that, I trailed off suddenly, not sure what else to say.  Anything that anyone could say about the death of a loved one seemed hollow.

She shook her head.  Its alright sweetie, death is just a natural part of living after all.   

She poked the doll one more time with finality, Ill sell it to you for a dollar. She said with a smile.

I thought for a moment.  I would get in trouble if my husband found that doll.  Of course he might not even know what it was if he did find it.  Buying it would be a risk, and an act of defiance. 

I think that sounds just fine. I handed over the money and she handed me back my change and stuffed everything in the bag for me.

I left the yard sale feeling accomplished.  I had gotten a good deal.  Even better than shopping at the thrift store.  I would have bought more but I was expected to be back in time to make lunch.
I dug around in the bag and set my little doll on the dashboard.  It almost felt like having a friend along for the ride.  Once I finished the rest of my errands I drove home, making sure to stuff the doll in my purse. I didnt want Marcus to know that I had spent money on something so frivolous.  

While I was putting the groceries away Marcus came in from the garage, I noted with a stab of anger that he was wiping his greasy hands on one of my old shirts.

Give me the change and show me what you bought.  If its not appropriate Im turning it into rags like I did the others.  

I pulled out the change from my billfold which he stuffed into his wallet while he waited for me to show him what I bought.  Each shirt was laid out on the table for his inspection, I was certain that they would be alright but I was still nervous.  

These are okay, you dont need to be showing any kind of skin anyway. Where did you buy them? He asked finally looking at me.
A yard sale, I figured that they would be cheaper.  I answered him daring to meet his eyes.

Good, this should be enough for you for now. I dont want any wife of mine spending money on clothes that she doesnt need.  Make some lunch now, Im hungry, And with that he walked back out to the garage.

 Gathering up the shirts I placed them neatly in my closet. My wardrobe was looking very sparse.  As for the doll I stuffed him under my pillow.  I knew I was risking Marcus finding it, but for some reason I was comforted by its presence and I wanted it close.  
The next few weeks passed in a kind of blur.  The only good thing was my new job.  I was really enjoying it, and I was getting along really well with my coworkers.  At home things were getting progressively worse.  

What had started out with pinches and grabs was evolving into punches.  The first time he ever hit my face was when I had asked if I could have a cell phone.  The force of the hit flung my head back and I hit the wall and I started to cry.  While I was slumped against the wall he punched me in the back, driving the breath from my body.  I fell to the floor and stayed there until Marcus went out into the garage.  My face, though swollen, didnt bruise so I didnt have to make up any excuses for my co-workers.  

The weekly gas allowance that Marcus had promised me was five dollars a week. I had nothing from which to save, which made the idea of running away even harder.  I was not allowed to buy my own lunch or go anywhere after work, even though several coworkers had invited me out.  

My only relief at home was my tiny doll.  Once Marcus was done with his abuse Id hug it to my chest and cry.  It was the only thing in the house that was truly mine.  I thought of my father, and how much I missed him.  I also thought about how much I wished hed lived and my mother died.  He would never have forced me to marry Marcus.  He would never have let Jedidiah into our lives.

As the months wore on I thought I was starting to go crazy
Perhaps the isolation and abuse were screwing with my brain.  Every time I looked at the doll it looked a little more like Marcus every day.  Its tiny stitch eyes and mouth, so devoid of expression now seemed to remind me of my husbands glare and perpetual scowl.

It was on a Saturday in September that I received the worst beating I had gotten so far.  I had been very tired that morning, and while Marcus had gone to meet some friends from our old town I lay down to take a nap.  I had been sleeping peacefully on the bed when suddenly I was thrown to the floor. I screamed as I opened my eyes and saw Marcus staring down at me.

Why are you sleeping? On a Saturday? Dont you have eyes to see that the house is a mess? What kind of wife cant even clean properly? He lifted his booted foot and brought it down hard on my stomach.

My breath left me in a painful oomph! I had no time to recover before be pulled his leg back and kicked me in the ribs, once, twice, then three times.  I was screaming and begging for him to stop.  All it got me was a slap to the face.

He knelt down beside me and held me by my hair forcing me to look in his eyes.  If this house isnt clean, and lunch on the table by the time I get back from the hardware store Ill do even worse to you. Do you understand? 

Yes, Marcus, I understand.  I stammered, holding his gaze until he let my hair go and my head hit the carpet with a thunk.

I stayed on the ground till I heard the front door slam behind him.  I felt my stomach and my ribs.  Was anything broken or bruised? I couldnt tell.  It hurt so bad, I couldnt sit up, but I made myself crawl to the bathroom.  When I was able to stand I swallowed some aspirin and stared at myself in the mirror.  My right eye cheek was starting to swell and bruise, there would be no way to hide these marks from my co-workers on Monday.  

My stomach burned as I went back into the bedroom, I took out my doll and sobbed into its fabric.  Now more than ever it reminded me of Marcus, his evil glare and twisted mouth were there, plainly on the dolls face.

I felt a surge of anger and hatred for him.  I had never in my life wanted anyone or anything to die as much as I wanted Marcus to die.  From under the bed I took my sewing box and grabbed the largest needle I could find.  With one last look at the doll I stabbed the needle right through its left eye piercing it completely.

The doll fell to the ground and I left it there.  I couldnt find the energy to pick it back up.  My mind was made up, I could call my old office and see if anyone could let me stay with them for a while.  They had always been kind to me, surely one of them would help me. I mentally chastised myself for not thinking of it earlier.
  
Instead of cleaning like Marcus had wanted, I started packing my suitcase.  I raided Marcuss bedside table for loose change and came up with a few crumbled bills and change that would give me enough gas to drive away.  I made a place for my doll on top of my clothes.  I pulled out the sewing needle feeling guilty for stabbing it in the eye.  Oddly enough it looked like its old self again.  All traces of Marcuss scowl were gone.

There was a knock at the door and my heart jumped into my throat.  It was Marcus, back to make good on his promise. But it couldnt be Marcus, if it was him he would have just opened the door and walked in.  

To be safe though I hid my suitcase in the closet and ran to answer the door.  It was not Marcus, but two police officers staring at me through the screen door.  My heart was pounding, maybe a neighbor had heard my screams and called the cops?  

Opening the door I forced a smile.  Hello officers, can I help you?

The male police officer took off his hat and gave me a sorrowful look.  His partner, a woman, took one look at my bruised and swollen face and gave me a very knowing look.

Maam, Im sorry to tell you this. But your husband has been in an accident.

The next few days were all a continual blur as I made arrangements for my husbands funeral.  Marcus had died while driving his truck.  The doctors told me after his autopsy that he had suffered from a massive brain aneurysm that had killed him instantly.  His car had rolled off into a ditch, the force of the impact had tossed his body through the windshield.  The ambulance had arrived in minutes but there was nothing anyone could have done.

His parents and siblings were beyond any consolation, and my heart went out to them.  Marcus might have been their kin, but they shared none of his temperament.  They were nothing but kind to me and I couldnt help but feel guilty for causing them any pain.

At the funeral I wore a new black dress with short sleeves.  Not caring whether anyone saw the bruises on my arm that had been Marcuss final parting gift.

Jedidiah took issue with it though.  He looked indifferently over my bruised arms. These things can happen in a marriage. He was a good husband to you Greta, at least cover up so no one can talk ill of the dead.  

With the funeral over I had freedom for the first time in my life.  It was a liberating feeling.  To have my own place, and my own money, and to do as I pleased.  I took perhaps too much pleasure in donating Marcuss possessions.  But I felt completely purged when the last reminder of him was gone from the house.  

The only problem was my mother and Jedidiah.  They were pressuring me to come back and live with them.  Despite my assurances that I was doing okay, and I was getting by with just my paycheck.

My step-father would call me on my new cell phone and lecture me about how an unmarried womans place was at home. And he would talk about how much my mother missed me.  His voice was sickeningly condescending as he talked to me like a child.  I listened politely while he told his peace over the phone.  All the while holding my doll to me chest.  And you know what?  It was starting to look a lot like Jedidiah.

<TEXT> Sadly yes. I think part of that is because the police didn't take it seriously at first. If they had maybe he'd have been caught. Even with the later postcard there was very little to go on. There's always a chance he might send another. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I'll Take Very Good Care of Her </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-07 22:28:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My sister Ashley had always been beautiful.  She was the first-born, my parents pride and joy.  No matter what grade she had been in she was always the most beautiful girl in the school.  I was several years younger than her, but I had always looked up to my sister with a kind of awed reverence.  When I was a child I had followed her everywhere, and for a long time we had been extremely close.  She was the one who was always willing to play hide and seek with me, and she would dress me up in her clothes when she had sleepovers with her friends.  Sometimes she would even let me stay up with them and chat about big girl stuff, which seemed so much more interesting than my world of Barbies and tea parties.

It all changed when she was around thirteen.  She was officially a teen, at least in her eyes, and she had begun to fill out into a womans body.  I was blissfully unaware that our relationship had changed.  However, she no longer let me follow her around, and her new favorite thing to call me was annoying.  

This had hurt me and I had retreated to my parents to tell them of how she had changed.  They laughed and said it was normal sister stuff and that I needed to leave her alone as she was getting older and did not have time to tolerate my childish attention.
Needless to say, she had always been the favorite child.  Not that my parents ever treated me badly.  In fact I had always considered them very good parents.  But with my sister they always had their blinders on, to them she could do no wrong.  When I realized that I did my best to avoid Ashley and give her the space she so desired.  It was almost like having a stranger living in the house with me.  As I got older I had hoped that we would be back to the close relationship we once shared.

Ashley kept herself busy, and my parents were always looking for things to add to her regimen.  They were obsessed with keeping her well rounded with extracurricular activities to make her eligible for scholarships.  Luckily she was naturally smart and athletic, and she fit right into gymnastics and always got her homework done on time.  Sometimes she would even find time to tutor other students who needed the help.  Between her homework, gymnastics, and her active social life she was always on the move. Even I was not immune, I was forced to join band and even take martial arts to pad out my high school resume.  

Boys suddenly became a huge part of her life.  From the age of thirteen to eighteen she always had a boyfriend somewhere, hanging around in the background. My parents were extremely strict though.  They were adamant that she not date anyone while she was in high school.  You got to focus on your grades, they would say, so she learned to be cautious and became a rather talented liar.  She mostly dated her friends brothers, so when she went to their houses to visit or study it did not raise my parents suspicions.  If they had known she had been having sex for years they would have blown a fuse that would have decimated at least a city block.

The only reason I had known about this was because I heard her giggling and telling her friends one day.  Yes, I was eavesdropping which I know was wrong, but I still did it.  Besides, they were in my house and they shouldnt have left the bedroom door wide open.  Luckily she didnt know that I had overheard her or I probably would have gotten a punch for being a snoop.
A few months before she was set to graduate high school the AP English teacher, Mrs. Bragg, had been diagnosed with cancer.  There was a huge outpouring of support for her as she was really loved.  Even though she was never my teacher I felt bad for her, as she was one of the few teachers that everyone liked and I had never heard a single bad thing about her.

With that news, and the fact that she would take a leave of absence, the school scrambled to find a substitute teacher to fill her place while she was gone.

They eventually found a substitute, and he sent the school into another uproar for an entirely different reason.  The new substitute teacher was gorgeous.  As in, he had to have been a model at some point in his life.  He looked like he should be sitting on a beach in LA rather than the halls of a high school.  Over six feet with brown hair, clear blue eyes, a perfect physique; it was not long before he had a legion of female admirers.  Before the end of the day every girl in the school had walked by the classroom trying to catch a glimpse of the new guy.  Even the female teachers were making their attention obvious.  

His name was Mr. Adam Ray, and he quickly became the most popular teacher in the entire school.  He even seemed to be really good at his job, I didnt hear anything bad about him at all.  And my sister quickly became his favorite pupil, for all the wrong reasons.

I had only seen him a few times around the school.  Since he was teaching the seniors there was never a reason to interact with him before.  There was something about him that always set me on edge.  It was the way he would interact with the students, especially the female ones.  The intensity in his eyes was unnerving, like a dog eyeing a piece of meat.  But since everyone else seemed to adore him I just thought I was crazy.  I was secretly glad I wouldnt have any classes with him.

Ashley started staying late after school not soon after Mr. Ray started teaching at the school, at first she said that she was staying late because she wanted to get extra help from her teachers.  Later she said she was staying late to help tutor other students who were struggling in English.  My parents nodded their approval and reminded her to put on her college applications that she was doing volunteer work.  She smiled at my parents and assured them that she would.

Months past, and my sister got accepted into college with a complete scholarship to her dream college in North Carolina.  We were all ecstatic for her.  She had worked hard and I remember both my mom and sister crying with happiness.  It was a month to graduation and my parents were already planning to throw a huge graduation party.  They were going to invite everyone they could think of and started sending out invitations.  Now, my parents are actually very wealthy so they treated this thing like it was a wedding.  They were spending enough that it might as well have been.

My sister had been getting more and more secretive though, the entire time her grades never slipped so it never registered with my parents.  In fact her English grades were fantastic, she had been getting straight As for months.  But since we shared a wall between our bedrooms I could hear her late at night talking on her phone, giggling, and even sometimes moaning which I didnt even want to think about too much.

I had my suspicions.  Her friends came over less and less and she started spending even more time away from home.  I assumed it was a new boy that had caught her attention, but I had no idea who it was.  She would frequently miss dinner and tell us that she had picked something up on the way home.  My parents started insisting that she come home for dinner on time every night, it was the first time I had ever seen them get even remotely stern with her.  She huffed and fumed but started coming home every night on time, but as soon as dinner was over she went into her room to study; but I could still hear the faint sounds of her talking on the phone with someone.

The day of the school graduation had arrived and my parents were prepared and beaming for the event.  My sister looked beautiful in her white dress that she wore under her robe, and my mom had taken her to the hair salon to get her hair done for the ceremony. Even I dressed up as I wanted to look nice for my sister on her big day.  She was getting ready to become an adult and go to her dream college.  She was even nice to me that day, which I relished.  I was hoping that while she was away at college I could come visit her, and maybe we could become close again like we had been as children.

At the school, we struggled to find a place to park and then shuffled awkwardly to find a place on the bleachers as every parent and extended family member seemed to come to these things.  When Ashelys name was called and there was huge cheer as she went to accept her diploma, she stopped and waved and my mom cried as she took her picture with the camera.  After her walk across the stage she stepped out into the hallway, to join her friends and the other students.  

My mom wanted to go and wait for my sister in the hallway, but we were boxed in and couldnt get out easily.  So we waited until the ceremony was over and everyone finally started filing out of the auditorium.  About thirty minutes had passed since we had seen Ashely walk off the stage and my parents were smiling ear to ear.  But we couldnt find her anywhere.  My dad even looked outside to see if she had given up on us and was waiting by the car.  She wasnt there.

My mom called her cell phone but all she got was voice mail.  By this time we had been looking for her for another thirty minutes and the hallway was mostly empty.  I spotted one of my sisters friends leaving and I ran over to her, asking her if she had seen my sister.  My sisters friend got this weird sort of smile on her face and laughed, telling me that she was sure that my sister had already left with someone.  I started getting worried, as I knew that she would have at least called us to let us know she had caught a ride with someone.

I ran back and told my parents and they just got even more upset, but they assumed that she caught a ride with a friend.  Perhaps she had been too excited about the graduation to call them.  Still, I knew she would be trouble for leaving like that.  We all just assumed that she was back at our house.  Thats where the graduation party was going to be so maybe she had wanted to get an early start.  We got back home in record time, hoping to see one of her friends cars parked there.  But we didnt see any of her friends cars there, which was weird since they were all invited.  The road was lined with lots of our friends and relatives cars, and I saw perhaps a dozen of my family members milling around in the back yard.

Once we parked my mom went into the house, and my dad walked towards the backyard.  I could tell by the way he moved that he was really angry.  I was certain that he would ground my sister from her own party at this point.  I stayed outside talking to my aunt and explaining the situation when my mom came running back out of the house.  She had a note in her hand and I had a sinking feeling in my stomach.  My mom was hysterical and couldnt speak so I gently took the note from her and read it to myself.

Dear mom and dad, 
By the time you read this I will be gone.  I know you wont understand this but I am in love.  Mr. Ray and I have been in love for several months and he has asked me to marry him. I said yes.  We are moving to North Carolina so I can attend college with my scholarship.  Mr. Ray already has a new job for the next school year and has promised to support me, so I will not ask you for money.  I knew you would try to stop us so I left in secret. Please dont be mad, Ill call you when I get to North Carolina.  Keep in mind Im eighteen and a legal adult so I can make my own decisions. I love you guys.

P.S. Youre really going to love Mr. Ray, hes the greatest guy in the world!

And under that note was another message, written in a fine cursive hand.  Dont worry, Ill take very good care of her.  

It was not my sisters handwriting, so I assumed it was Mr. Ray.
After reading this I handed it over to my dad who scanned the note and became completely red in the face.  He pulled out his phone and started calling the police.  My aunts consoled my mom and I ran upstairs to my sisters room. It was pristine, but I noticed that some things were missing from their usual spot. A framed photo of our grandmother was gone, along with a stuffed pink bunny that shes had for years.  I looked in the closet and her favorite clothes were missing. Not all of them but enough to show that a lot had been packed into a suitcase.  She was really gone.

The next few hours were a blur, the cops could do nothing as she was eighteen and not really a missing person until 24 hours had passed.  My parents and I called up all her friends, but they seemed to be deliberately unhelpful, and I suspected that they knew more than what they were telling us.  The food sat untouched until my parents insisted that people eat some so it wouldnt go to waste.  We even cut the cake that read Congratulations Ashley.  People ate and talked, no one had wanted to leave as they waited to see if there was any news about my sister.  Her graduation presents sat unopened on the counter until I moved them to the closet, they were too depressing to look at.

It was on the seventh day that we finally got some news.  Her suitcase had been found on the side of the road twenty miles from home.  It had been identified because her wallet and purse had been stuffed inside.  The news sent my mother into another fit of hysterics and she fainted.  

We also finally got one of her friends to talk to us when she came to our house in tears, saying that she had gotten a call from Ashley.  A phone number she did not recognize had called her but she ignored it thinking it was a wrong number.  When she saw they had left a voicemail she had listened to it.  It was a twenty second long message where my sisters voice could be clearly heard screaming for help.  A mans voice could be heard in the background and the call went silent.  My sisters friend was certain that it had been Mr. Rays voice.

After that her friends were a little more helpful with their information.  They told us that my sister and Mr. Ray had been having an affair from almost the very first day.  They thought it was romantic and helped her hide the relationship from everyone. It had been planned months in advance that they would run away together.

My father and mother did all they could to find my sister.  A private investigator was hired and it finally came out that Adam Ray was not who he said he was.  He had used a fake name and all his information was false. To give some context this all happened in the late 1990s, when smart phones were still years away and we still used dial up internet.  Looking someone up on the internet was not as simple as it is today.  Nowadays a quick google search would have revealed this guy had been a liar. His real name was Adam Raymond, but what made our blood run cold was that he had been in trouble with the law before.  In fact he had served time in jail for beating up a former girlfriend.  

Months went by and we had no idea what happened to my sister.  They never turned up in North Carolina.  They didnt turn up anywhere.  Adam Raymond had vanished from the earth and he had taken Ashley with him.  The investigation stalled for both the cops and the private investigator.  When that happened they hired other private investigators but they also turned up nothing.  My parents sued the school corporation for not running an adequate background check and letting a criminal into the school system.  They settled out of court for a substantial sum of money.

Years passed, all of my sisters friends went to college and graduated.  I graduated high school as well though it was a more subdued affair.  They even had a graduation party for me, but I could see it in their eyes that they were thinking of my sister the whole time.

I went to college, though I went to a nearby college so I could live at home.  My parents wouldnt say it but I knew they were relieved that I was close enough to them to keep an eye on me.  
I eventually graduated college, and I was getting ready to move out of my parents house to attend graduate school.  It was a happy and nervous time, as this would be my first time living on my own.  My parents even seemed proud of me.

I was sorting the mail one day in the few days before my college graduation.  There were a lot of cards for me, people sending congratulations through the postal service.  There was one card that stood out from the rest.  It was a postcard and it looked dirty and tattered, like it had sat on the ground before being put into the mail box.  I didnt think anything of it till I flipped it over and saw what was on the other side.  There was a Polaroid of a grimy and disheveled woman, wearing an oversized white T-shirt that looked just as dirty as the postcard.  I could easily make out her ribs and see the leanness of her legs, she reminded me of a holocaust survivor.  She wasnt wearing anything else. At that moment I froze, as I looked at the womans face I recognized her.  It was Ashley, emaciated and looking far older than a woman in her 20s should ever look.  Her gaze was vacant and empty, like a beaten dog, she didnt even seem aware that someone had taken her picture.  And beneath it was a short sentence.  Im taking really good care of her.
