<TEXT> I see what your saying, I'm just basing the roles now based on their type cast and applying it from old to current actors. Like "whose the ass kicking actress?" - Scarlett. "Whose the funny over the top black comedian?" - Kevin Hart </TEXT>

<TITLE> Significance of glass breaking </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-02 19:18:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So we've all talked about them being inside glass cages, aquariums etc. Between the cells they're being kept it, the aquarium Homer sees, and the high school cafeteria they're all built very similar. 

I'm the final moments of the last episode the bullet breaks through the glass and into OA. They film this very dramatically so we see the 5 pieces broken around her heart. 

Is the breaking through the glass significant here? Meaning its breaking through a dimension or reality etc. She's on the outside while the others remain inside.  Now that the glass is broken she's free.

<TEXT> Right, well continuing that. Can we infer that maybe the jumping off the bridge and waking up in the hospital we see are two separate events, not connected linearly? Maybe in the final moments of the final episode with her waking up , she's in a mental hospital perhaps weeks after she jumped.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first 30 seconds may be a key to the whole show.  OA is seen in a video filmed running across traffic ( on what some say are two different bridges in NYC or St.Louis ). The child filming says to his mother : "She's going to the otherside" and "She let go" right before OA jumps of the bridge. 

I feel like the phrase "She's going to the otherside" is profound here and opens up possibilities to new angles. 

What if the bridge jump scene and the waking up in the hospital scene didnt happen linearly. They're  two separate events.  I have a subreddit on this topic hitting other issues.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lol. I get what your saying. I was also trying to point out to us as the viewers hearing and seeing this story,  that saying " She's going to the otherside" may play as a key in understanding the narrative, and putting things together in a outer box perspective  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's one thing I feel like people don't mention or make theories for enough is what happens in the first 30 secs of the whole show.

Theres a kid filming a video in the back of their car, they see Prairie is running around (on what looks like a bridge in NYC.) 

The mother and kid have a dialogue that says:

Kid: "Mom, mom that lady"
Mom: "Shes fine, look shes ok"  
(Prarie runs to the edge)
Kid: "She's going to the otherside"
Mom: "NO NO. GOD! DON'T LOOK"
(Prarie jumps)
Kid: whispers "She let go"

To me there's a lot of questions here. 

- Did she die and wake up in another dimension / otherside? If so, are the new 5 the same as the old 5? 

- How was she rescued? Did she drown? Wouldn't she have broken limbs from a drop this high?

- If this is in NYC , how did she get to "Hospital in St. Louis" 

- If you were to jump off a bridge, wouldn't they surely take you to a mental hospital?

- Why did kid say "She's going to the otherside". Kids don't say that 

- Is the incident at the bridge and her waking up in the hospital two separate events. Maybe they didn't occur linearly.

<TEXT> Hmm, good thoughts there.
That concept may also flow along with parellels between OA and Steve:
OA is uncomfortable with people touching her and so is Steve is too, in the way of being vulnerable or being rejected. 
Referring to when he punched a hole in the wall in the 1st episode after he has sex with that girl and she said  "This is not a thing" like rejecting him. He felt vulnerable and punched a hole.

<TEXT> What if the place Homer is trying to escape is a real life Psychiatric Hospital? With the white walls and people trying to catch him and them telling him he isn't who he says, seems like maybe he's a mental patient. This could also explain where OA wakes up in the very last shot of the last scene. She's sitting in a bed with white walls and says Homer. Maybe they're both psyche patients and the fish tank is an inspiration turning into over exaggeration of being captive. Idk, just thoughts.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure if someones covered this, but haven't seen it mentioned. Why did Steve stab OA in the leg with a pencil? She's trying to hug and comfort him (even though she doesn't like people touching her) and he stabs her. What's up with that? She later has to remove the lead from her leg. Thoughts? </TEXT>

<TEXT> One thing I haven't seen many touch in on this topic is how is it that he hears the events of his NDE just prior to experiencing it? When he sneaks into HAPS office and listens to a cd labeled HOMER, he hears "Stop right there!" and the clanging noises of a chase just as it happens in the NDE. Has he been having this NDE over and over but forgetting it because of the gas each time?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a good insight. I wondered the same thing. I've thought myself that (like most real people who experience NDE or OBEs) that this is place is another Astral plane or dimension that parellels the one she exists in already. I've read a lot of books on OBEs and most always they mention Astral Projection. So traveling around Saturn is completely possible in an Astral projection experience. </TEXT>

1)She is a singer (like Rachel)
2) She/he sees an accident on the side of the road before meeting at the house the last time. There was a red backpack and road flares. Rachel also mentions a similar car accident for her NDE a few episodes earlier with a red backpack.  </TEXT>
