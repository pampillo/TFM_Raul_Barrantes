<TEXT> Do you have any particular occasion or event in mind? There is going to be a huge difference between, say, a birthday party with some friends and a formally planned massive white party with a pool and a DJ, for example.

How much room do you have? How many people would be there? Etc. I think that will help people contribute better.

Hot tubs and pools almost always make for a fun party, but that's not realistic for lots of folks. The kinds of decorations, food, and drinks I recommend will be totally different based on the occasion and the theme! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Any great ideas for a weirdly themed bridal shower? We're thinking about doing "Christmas in July"... </TITLE>

<TEXT> My sister is getting married this fall and we're planning to do a bridal shower with the extended family during our usual family reunion in July.

She doesn't want much in the way of gifts since the wedding is shortly after and she and her fiance already live together in a well-stocked tiny apartment, but she DID express some interest in having everyone bring a Christmas ornament as a gift, so that they'll be able to decorate their own Christmas tree.

So I was thinking of making the shower "Christmas in July" themed, but I don't want to go FULLY cheesy. Any thoughts on how to make that work? </TEXT>

<TEXT> LOVE THIS idea. I would definitely involve some Lisa Frank-inspired temporary tattoos and/or stickers, maybe scattered on some tables like confetti. And yes, I think an obnoxiously ranbowy cake or cupcakes is also a must.

I've also been shamelessly plugging the sub I just took over, /r/partyplanning. I would love to see posts/discussions like this happening over there too - maybe you can post some pics of the party afterwards to share with other people?? :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love making a big batch of cocktails for theme parties in particular! IMO beer and wine are great (and usually I have those too) but cocktails are fun and refreshing and can really add to the party theme.

The only downside/difficult part is usually finding recipes that make a full pitcher. So here's a list of a few. I've also made [these cranberry ginger cocktails](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/dave-lieberman/ginger-cranberry-cocktail-frozen-vodka-or-gin-recipe) for Friendsgiving and [these margaritas](http://cookieandkate.com/2012/fresh-margaritas/) for a summertime taco party.

I recommend making them the day of the party, not too far in advance, and then keeping them chilled right up until the party starts (or if possible, keep the pitcher on ice during the party). I've also read that it's a good idea to add a little bit of water to large batch cocktails to mimic the role of melted ice you'd normally get in individual cocktails. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sounds fantastic so far.

In college we had one of those spinning light up disco ball things... Not even sure what to call it but it made every party better. Seems like it would feel very Miami ([something like this?](https://www.amazon.com/GLISTENY-Changing-Rotating-Activated-Ballroom/dp/B01BBRB0KO/ref=zg_bs_5486431011_2?_encoding=UTF8 psc=1 refRID=0R1RMECGS2ENFCDMQS44)).

What about food and drinks? Can you make/have someone make little cuban sandwiches? Not sure about cocktails, but maybe something rum-based?

You could also get some of those plastic striped sunglasses and scatter them around to have people put on. 

And don't forget the Miami playlist, including plenty of Will Smith obviously... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not exactly, I make chili all the time so I just kind of make it up as I go, but it's really easy! 

I basically just throw an onion, a bell pepper, some jalepenos, and lean ground turkey into a pot and cook them. Then add some seasoning, tomato sauce, and diced tomatoes (different recipes use different tomato options, but I like a little texture, and I usually use Rotel to get some extra flavor). Let it simmer a bit and then add a can of beans. That's it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are surprisingly not too bad! Obviously not low carb if that's what you're going for, but Google says a "medium" one (173g) is 161 calories. You can weigh them for better accuracy, or I sometimes just guesstimate 200 calories to be safe.

I used to just assume potatoes were terrible too, but then I realized it's just because I associate them with mashed potatoes, french fries, tater tots, etc. You could also replace with a sweet potato or some mashed squash (I'm weird but that's actually my favorite).

It's honestly so filling that I can barely eat the whole bowl, which is perfect because I'm a notorious night snacker. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually do use greek yogurt, but I also add white vinegar (in addition to the seasoning packet). I find that it thins it out a bit and adds some tanginess so it tastes less like it's just flavored yogurt. I also recommend letting it sit in the fridge for a bit to let the flavors mingle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I'm eating this week:

* **Breakfast:** Oikos triple zero (I change it up, but banana creme is my favorite!) + half a scoop of vanilla protein powder + a small handful of blueberries. Also, tons of black coffee. **~228 calories**
* **Lunch:** Homemade "broccoli salad" (blanched broccoli topped with reduced-sugar craisins, sliced almonds, and homemade vinaigrette). **391 calories**
* **Snack:** Apple. **~80 calories**
* **Dinner:** Homemade turkey chili over a baked potato. **433 calories**
* **Dessert:** 2 caramel corn rice cakes, and usually some hot tea. **100 calories**
* **Total: 1232 calories**

I change my lunch salad and my dinner every week, but more or less my days always follow this kind of "template". Right now my struggle is to eat more protein without getting bored of my meals or eating too many calories...

<TEXT> Well depending on what you decide to cook, it's really not a lot of time or very complicated! You can still cook something really simple and just make several days worth - that's all I do. It actually saves more and is simpler compared to making 3 different dinners on 3 different nights!

I'm talking a big pot of chili, or baking 4 chicken breasts instead of 1-2 for example. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So that stressed/overwhelmed snacking you're doing when you can't figure out what to eat for dinner is *exactly why* I like to meal prep - that way I only have to think about it once per week, and every night my food is pre-made.

I don't go super crazy with it. I always have some sort of yogurt for breakfast, some sort of salad for lunch, and then dinner is different every week. For me, having a basic structure makes it easier to plan.

Throughout the week I'll use things like Tumblr or Pinterest or just google-searching things that sound tasty to me to find possible recipes. I save anything that looks good so that I always have a big stockpile of options.

Then on the weekend, I pick one salad and one entree from my stockpile, plug them in as recipes in MFP (it does most of the work for you) to make sure they fit in my calorie goals, and then use the recipes to build my grocery list. I only buy what I need at the grocery store, so that I don't have a bunch of extra food to use up or snack on.

I try to make my entree that weekend (usually something simple, like soup, or chicken and roast veggies). I divide it up into individual tupperwares so that when I get home for dinner, all I have to do is microwave it. I make my salads every day so that they're fresh and so I don't have to do a ton of meal prep up front.

That's it! Like anything, it takes time to make it a routine, but my life actually feels so much easier and less stressful overall when I do this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I actually had read that and bought a couple, but the openings on them are TINY. I tried using them but it was so hard to get the icing out that it hurt my hand more than using a bag... I think I might try cutting one of them to widen the opening and see if that works. Thanks!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you! I'll be trying again today and hopefully it goes better... I think part of my challenge was that I was experimenting with icing thickness and the size of the piping tip at the same time. Accidentally went too runny and too large which made for a big mess.

What size do you usually use (if you know)? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lemon curd usually doesn't make a great macaron filling on its own because it's a bit too soft and runny, I think, but for some reason I was *craving* these and had to try them.

Like I expected, pretty slippery off the bat, but after refrigerating for a day, enough of the liquid soaked into the shells that the macarons were plenty stable and they absolutely melted in your mouth! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm throwing my second annual (very cheesy) Galentine's Day party this weekend. This year's craft is cookie decorating, so I'm planning to bake and "flood" a bunch of cookies ahead of time so that everyone can decorate on top of that. 

This was test run #1... The icing was a bit too runny, and then I accidentally exploded some icing out the top of the piping bag, at which point I gave up! Going to need lots more practice this week...

Edit: really entertained that this has this many upvotes even though it's so ugly. That's why I love /r/Baking! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can also look for "merengue powder" - different name but it's just dried egg whites + a bit of cornstarch to prevent clumping. I've never used it in macarons but it's commonly used to make royal icing. I know you can buy it at Michael's.

Edit: PS These are BEAUTIFUL. I'm going to try heart macarons this weekend for a Galentines Day party... fingers crossed they turn out! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So true! On a smaller scale oven temp can determine whether your "feet" explode out sideways or rise straight up. It can take a lot of testing to pick the right temp for your specific finnicky oven (and/or just get an oven thermometer I suppose...).

<TEXT> Just to throw in my 2 cents, I'm not sure the hotel advice rings true during busy season. Hotels/hostels tend to book up way in advance and you run the risk of being left with nowhere to stay. It's quite different during winter months.

Also, I took a one day tour on a minibus before renting a car and doing my own travel, and I actually loved it and would highly recommend it. I did a Golden Circle tour with Iceland Horizon. The driver was an older Iceland native and gave tons and tons of interesting information and great stories during the tour. It was nice to learn a bit more before heading out on my own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a tendency to do the exact same thing so I always go a bit longer than I think I need to! But I totally agree, the mixing is way more important than sifting. I actually made my last batch without sifting at all, just to experiment, and it was not at all noticeable. Undermixing prevents them from getting nice and smooth, and adding a few strokes takes WAY less time than sifting flour, so I'd go with that. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> So cute, I'm loving the little rainbow sprinkles on the white macarons!! I may need to steal that idea. Did you sprinkle them on before baking, or somehow adhere them later?

And I agree, it looks like they may be just a bit undermixed (maybe just the chocolate, I can't tell) which can prevent them from smoothing out as much and make them look a bit lumpier - I have a tendency to undermix too so I always try to go a bit longer than I think I need to. But they look fantastic! </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the shells themselves, I use the Italian method - there are a ton of recipes that all slightly differ of course. The one I use is probably closest to [this one](http://loveandmacarons.blogspot.com/2013/01/macaron-recipe-italian-meringue-method.html). 

I didn't follow any particular recipe for the color and filling, I've just been experimenting, but getting a swirl like this is actually really easy. I just took a paintbrush and painted a few lines of food coloring gel down the insides of the piping bag before filling it up with the macaron batter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not vegan and have no experience doing any kind of vegan baking, but I have a vegan friend visiting and wanted to give this a shot.

It didn't go amazingly well - I think the temperature is partially to blame. Most recipes recommend cooking at a much lower temp than regular macarons, and for longer. I experimented a bit between two pans and not sure either way worked super well. Most of the batch looked [more like this](http://imgur.com/a/F2x3h), and a few of them cracked/were hollow inside. :)

However, I'm still impressed with how well aquafaba (the liquid in chickpea cans) whips up like egg whites!

They're filled with a thin layer of raspberry preserves, plus a vegan chocolate ganache. My ganache ratios were also a bit off (maybe just because almond milk is so thin) so that turned out a bit runny... Not my best work, but they taste fantastic! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure, we approximated a lot but I can do my best! According to the cookbook we used, mincemeat's original purpose was actually to preserve meat, so people would make and store huge amounts of it, and then just use some of it for pie, which is why most of the recipes are in large amounts.

The original recipe we referenced was [this one](http://www.bartleby.com/87/r1446.html) I believe (we had it in hard copy, but this looks right). Basically we then cross referenced with [this scaled down recipe](http://www.ourheritageofhealth.com/old-fashioned-mincemeat-pie-recipe-from-1798/) which calls for 1lb of beef instead of 4 - based on that, we mostly just divided everything by 4! Ours was a little overly spiced, so I might recommend bumping the nutmeg down a bit as well.

Edit: So I think what we ended up with was approximately:

- 1lb chopped beef
- 1/2lb beef suet
- 2 apples
- 1 cup dried fruits (we mixed a few we had on hand)
- 1/2 cup brandy
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup molasses
- 1/2 tsp each of the listed spices (we used more nutmeg based on the recipe but next time I'd use less) </TEXT>

<TEXT> A little backstory - mince pie has always been my dad's favorite, but we'd usually make it the lazy way, by buying the pre-made filling in a jar. This Thanksgiving, over a couple of slices of mince pie, we decided to try making the real deal - meat included! We used an old Fannie Farmer recipe and scaled it down to individual pie size (the original recipe calls for 4lbs of beef...).

It was actually good - tasted nothing like meat. The spices were a bit strong (apparently the mince is supposed to mellow with age, so next time we'd use less) so it could have used a little whipped cream to mellow it out. This is a new Christmas tradition for us - old-fashioned recipe suggestions welcome for next year! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I grew up eating making and eating anise cookies for Christmas! We called them Kris Kringles. Just emailed my mother asking for the family recipe... I know we only ever used anise extract, but we put it in both the cookie and the frosting. 

Edit: She finally got back to me. Here's the recipe with all her notes. I'm sure these are not exactly what you're looking for, but I can attest that they're delicious!

KRIS KRINGLE COOKIES

- 1 cup butter
- 2 cups sugar
- 3 eggs
- 1 1/2 tsp cream of tartar
- 1 1/2 tsp baking soda DISSOLVED IN --
- 2 Tbsp milk
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp anise (can use vanilla if not Xmas)
  --- anise oil will give stronger flavor, but anise flavor is fine.
- 4 1/2 cups flour

Cream butter and sugar together.  Add anise, milk w/ baking soda, and eggs.  Mix.
Then add salt and cream of tartar sifted with 3 cups of the flour (I don't usually sift).
Gradually add more flour to make a dough that may be rolled.  Chill overnight or for 
several hours.  

Preheat oVen to 400 degrees.  Roll on lightly floured surface to desired thickness
(I do about 1/4 inch).   Cut and bake on ungreased cookie sheet,  400 degrees for
8 - 15 minutes till lightly browned on edges. They will cool to very crunchy and the 
frosting makes them softer again if you frost.

FROSTING

- 4 egg whites
- 1/2 tsp cream of tartar
- 1/2 tsp anise
- 5 cups sifted confectioners sugar

Beat egg whites and cream of tartar in very clean bowl until foamy.
Add anise.  Gradually beat in confectioners sugar until it forms soft peaks.
This takes a while!  If desired, divide into bowls and cober.  Frost.  Add colored
sugar or toppings as desired.  Let dry thoroughly before storing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What? That's not even what I'm talking about.

I'm saying you can't claim that talking about Obama's race must be uncommon because you haven't personally seen it, but calling conservatives racist and sexist is super common because you see it on Facebook the time. The truth is that both of these things certainly happen, and like this election showed us, we live in bubbles and we see what we want to see. Your anecdotal evidence does not mean it's reality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 
 Well it happened to me many times on reddit and people are still saying it today, so to be fair I gotta question your honesty here. My Facebook feed is just a wall of my friends saying they "can't believe how sexist and racist this country is". 

and then 

 I personally have never met a single conservative who has mentioned Obama's race. I'm not saying they don't exist but I haven't seen it personally so I can't believe it's as common as you all pretend.

Do you not see a little bit of a conflict here? I mean come on, can't we all just admit that both of these things happen more than we'd all like to admit? There are people on both sides of the aisle who say dumb things like this.

<TEXT> Yes, I've read several of those. Like I said, I understand the mindset and wanting change - it's why so many of us voted Obama the first time around. My overwhelming reaction to this election is just... sadness, because regardless of who won the election I don't realistically think there's much we can do to bring back manufacturing jobs to rural areas, for example. That ship has sailed. In 8 years I foresee small dying towns to be in largely the same position but with fewer healthcare options. I didn't vote Trump but I hope he proves me wrong somehow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tbh I think it would be rude to not invite them at all.

If your MOH plains the party on the east coast because most girls are there, you could probably get away with inviting them but making it clear that they don't need to feel obligated to spend the money and travel that far, and maybe you can separately have a night out with them in the midwest somewhere. But you should still be prepared for the possibility that they might want to come.

If you really feel like you don't get along with them and they wouldn't gel with the group, I might reconsider asking them to be part of your bridal party (since you say you have't already asked). Integrating different groups of friends/family happens in most bridal parties and is expected, but you have to get along with everybody to make that work I think. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Disclaimer: I'm not Jewish so I don't actually know that much about Jewish weddings, but my sister converted and married a Jewish guy, so maybe I can give the good and bad from the non-Jewish guest perspective.

Things that went well:

- They were married outdoors under a beautiful chuppah! These make such a great backdrop for photos.
- They had baskets of white yarmulkes that male guests picked up on their way into the ceremony. These doubled as favors, and I believe they had the wedding date embroidered in them but it's been years so I don't fully remember. My family is Catholic but they all totally loved these and willingly put them on for the ceremony. Very cute.
- I think everybody gets a kick out of the glass stomp and hava nagila/chair dancing. Literally had family members say "ALL of our weddings should be Jewish weddings!"

The less good:

- The ceremony was mostly in Hebrew, so none of us had any idea what was going on. He would say some sentences in English but there was a LOT of Hebrew singing... Good call on planning for the whole ceremony to be in English.
- The rabbi insisted on a kosher reception. Not a major crisis, but the food had to be vegetarian because of the wedding cake. We had also already done a food sampling with the venue before we found this out from the rabbi, so we had to pick food without tasting it. It turned out really well (think super fancy ravioli, etc) but if going kosher is not important to you, check with your rabbi to make sure he's cool with that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I fond a lot of things google image searching for "blush eggplant and gold wedding" and "blush plum and gold wedding" - almost all the wedding inspo I see has very specific fancy color names so try things along those lines. :) I'm sure many of these are not what you're looking for, but you might be able to find some gems, or send to your florist to say "like this, but with less purple and more blush". Or try adding in some additional search terms about your wedding like "elegant" or "rustic".

My sister's wedding colors are dusty blue and cranberry with pops of light pink and gold, for an outdoor garden wedding next September. She started off with a few colors in mind that felt very garden-y (blush, dusty blue, and sage) and then eliminated blush because we're too pale to look good in it and sage because the whole garden will be green and she wanted some contrast. It was mostly pinterest-ing that led to the cranberry combo.

Some of her pins that give a good sense: [1](http://o.aolcdn.com/smp/is/submissions/uploads/91176/54a6da5a404d0$!x900.jpg) [2](http://o.aolcdn.com/smp/is/submissions/uploads/104524/54f8a1e551d0e$!x900.jpg) [3](https://agneswrightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/oct-22nd.jpg) [4](http://www.thebridelink.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Fall-wedding-colors.jpg) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do actually vote Naya! But you have to make sure you love it and feel comfortable in it.

For what it's worth, I went to a bunch of dress shopping appointments with my sister (she's the bride to be) and we're just definitely not the emotional crying types. I absolutely love the dress she chose, but no one in our family was going to cry about it. 

Also, I took tons of pictures each time we went dress shopping and she frequently would love dresses more/less after the fact based on the photos, which might be how you're feeling now. She thought she loved a particular dress, then didn't love the photos after the fact, but couldn't get over another dress she had tried on - she ended up going back for that one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you, this is so helpful! I'm in the process of planning my sister's destination bachelorette for next summer so it really helps to hear feedback from the other side of things.

I'm definitely worried about the Airbnb situation - I won't want to wait too long to book it because we need a pretty big house and I want to make sure we get something nice. If I only factor in the "definite yeses" I might end up with a house that's too small, whereas factoring in too many people could lead to exactly what you described... the things that keep me up at night!

Also totally struggling with the communication. I lean towards being an over-communicator, as does my sister, but some of the girls have been pretty silent so far - I'd be more worried except my sister tells me some of them are ALWAYS like this and apparently there are people in the world who don't really check email all the time?!?

Glad to hear pole dancing class was fun - that's on our itinerary as well! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm of the opinion that few people actually choose their careers (namely, people who go to medical/dental/law school, and then do that line of work forever) and most people just sort of accidentally fall into them - which isn't a bad thing. Choosing a job is not the same thing as choosing your career.

I was a psych major who had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. Through what I like to call "a series of fortunate events" I worked my way up from a temp IT employee to a software pre-sales consultant. I didn't even really know this was a career that existed, but I love it. I still don't necessarily consider it to be my "career" because I might decide to do something different 5 years from now.

My dad runs those inmate work programs (mostly overseeing them manufacturing furniture and such), and before that worked for a company that manufactured ingredients that go in things like salad dressing and dog food. I'm pretty positive he didn't grow up saying "I want to make salad dressing preservatives when I grow up", but he LOVED both of those jobs.

My advice is to talk to a doctor about getting your anxiety under control, and stop thinking about a job as your final destination. Instead think of it as a way to learn something, make some money, and be a stepping stone to another job.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The max speed limit in Iceland is approximately the same as many highway speed limits in the US (90kph is about 55mph) but you will definitely not have time to do the full ring road in 3 days. The things you mentioned wanting to see are honestly likely out of reach for a short trip. I'd recommend keeping to the south coast. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got all the basic insurances (don't remember exactly) except Sand and Ash. No hot spot, I did get a SIM card and had a signal at most places, plus wifi in hostels/guesthouses so that was fine.

Yeah I think hostels are really just in Reykjavik and Akureyri, but you should be able to find other "guest houses" in some of the larger towns. I also stayed in Hofn, there were several places there and it's not far from Jokulsarlon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah the rental service was nice, although I have no idea how they compare to others tbh. I imagine they're all pretty similar.

I'm from Boston so used to driving on weird roads and in weird weather, but I was in Iceland in summer (I actually just left) and found it SO easy to get around. The roads are easy to understand and navigate and it's pretty hard to get lost unless you're really going off the main road I think. At intersections, the road signs have the number of the highway (e.g. 1), the name of the city/town you're heading toward (so you might see Reykjavik pointing one way, Akureyri pointing the other), and maybe the number of km. 

Also my rental came with built-in GPS, but I just used Google when I needed to (only to get me to specific locations) and it worked fine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not very familiar with Blazent but it looks like they do different things.

Servicewatch does top-down application/service mapping, so it will enhance your CMDB by automatically mapping CI's to the business-related services/applications they support, and then you can use those relationships for change/event/incident, etc.

Blazent doesn't appear to actually discover anything (I could be wrong), but rather analyzes your CMDB to look for and fix duplicates, bad relationships, etc, mostly stemming from multiple discovery sources and/or manual entry.

CMDB reconciliation used to be a bigger issue in SN, but it's been improved in recent releases to help support multiple sources, and like /u/ieatpotatochips said, there's a new CMDB health dashboard in Helsinki that might help with some of this as well. Entirely possible Blazent adds more on top of that, but I've never worked with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So as you've figured out, changing the label in one view will change it everywhere - it's the same field, just a different view of the overall form.

You could use a client script to conditionally change the label: http://www.servicenowguru.com/system-ui/ui-scripts-system-ui/modifying-label-form-fields-client-scripts/

A UI Policy can change 3 things about a field: visibility, read-only, and whether it's mandatory. So your other option would be to create a separate field that you only use for standard changes, label it the way you want, and use a UI policy to show that field for standard changes while hiding "requested by".

Out of curiosity, why do you need to relabel it just for standard changes? </TEXT>

Did a little too much walking from place to place, but had more fun than anyone should have in an art museum. Great conversation, he's really funny and super smart. 

Unfortunately we're both being slightly shy and awkward... date ended awkwardly with a hug again, I think both of us thought about a kiss but didn't go for it because lack of balls. Walked home kicking myself for being so painfully awkward. But we've been texting since and are planning a date 3.

And honestly the rounded corners and edges were like that when I started (I possibly made them a bit worse because I'm not sure how to sand already round corners! Although I actually hand sanded the entire table, no power tools involved here.). 

It's definitely an old table and had a lot of wear when I got it. The edges were unevenly rounded in some places, I suspect from lots of feet being kicked up on the table with previous owners. I don't mind, though, kind of gives it character! </TEXT>

And maybe... I have absolutely no experience with this stuff so I just started reading up on options today. I sanded between the two coats but I was worried sanding at the end would ruin the nice glossy finish and/or remove too much of the polyurethane? Maybe I should sand again, do a third coat, and then sand with even finer grain? Either way, I need to let it dry for a bit longer I think. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Definitely take a break - sometimes I find myself really needing a break, so I take a week off of lifting, and then I seem to come back better and stronger after.

Five months in a row of bulking can be tough. Are you underweight right now, or just trying to add muscle mass? How large is your calorie surplus right now? I would take the week off of everything, but when you come back I might recommend dropping to maintenance for a few weeks as well to kind of reset. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Carb cycling doesn't directly cause weight gain or weight loss - only a calorie surplus/deficit will do that. Carb cycling typically just refers to the "timing" of when you consume your carbs. 

I do some amount of carb cycling - I tend to focus carbs around my workouts, and I eat lower carb on days I don't work out. The goal is really just to help me prepare and recover from lifting as much as possible, while also losing weight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would double check your macro calculations first. 224 g of protein is really really high, and right now your macros add up to 1792 calories unless I mathed wrong (224x4 + 134x4 + 40x9). (Edit: fixed formatting).

Your carbs look really reasonable to me. I would make sure you're actually eating 1500 calories, not 1800, and lower your protein target (and maybe up fat just a tad).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the biggest thing to keep in mind is that calculators are a starting point and you can and should adjust them to work better for you. You will lose weight as long as you are at a calorie deficit. Within your calorie target, you can shift the macros around to support your goals.

I think a lot of the macro calculators out there are designed to support athletic performance - carbs are important for that. I know personally if I go too low carb, my lifts start to suffer. Carbs will likely also make it easier for you to spend an hour on the treadmill.

Other people find it easier to eat at a deficit and avoid cravings if they eat low carb, higher fat. So YMMV. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wish I had any advice... Unfortunately I think this is a pretty common issue.

My dad is in awesome shape - he's never been particularly unhealthy, but a few years ago he suddenly decided he wanted to lose weight and get in better shape. He started eating less and eating better, had a trainer for a little while, and now hits the gym every morning and runs half marathons - he's probably in better shape than I am! Ha!

My mom on the other hand is overweight (probably technically obese) and has been for as long as I remember, but she's always got an excuse up her sleeve (usually some sort of mysterious "health issue"). She falls victim to the idea that she's eating well because *antioxidants* and *superfoods* and *yogurt* and *oatmeal* - if it's a fad diet food, she eats it, but she's still very overweight.

Any time I try to have a conversation with her, my ideas are dismissed because I'm only 25 and haven't had kids so I still have "good metabolism". </TEXT>

It's hard to start out, but once you get used to it and adjust your overall life routine and sleep schedule, it becomes much easier. I don't even think about it much anymore, and on the occasional extra tired morning I think about how bad I'll feel if I don't go, how busy the gym is in the afternoon, etc.

Other than that, I pack literally everything ahead of time (all my food for the day, my work outfit in my gym bag, and my gym clothes and shoes ready to be put on) so it requires minimal effort in the morning. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Supplements" or even "muscle building supplements" is such a ridiculously broad term. Plenty of supplements, including [Creatine](http://examine.com/supplements/Creatine), one of the examples they listed, have been well-studied and found to be safe and effective.

The other example they listed and linked out to appears to be a test booster, which, in my incredibly unscientific opinion, seems more likely to be related to testicular cancer. 

Saying "supplements are linked to cancer" is almost as broad as saying "food is linked to cancer" - too broad and unnecessarily scary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally I prefer to split everything into tupperwares right away. It makes it easier to make sure things are portioned correctly so my calorie counts are more or less accurate, and I also leave early in the morning to go to the gym, so it's much easier to just grab a bunch of tupperwares. I'm also gone for about 12 hours and have found it easy to manage.

I have a random collection of tupperware I've built up over time, so can't comment on the chinese take out ones. I have some that handle liquid better (twisting lids or locking lids) and others that were just cheap.

[Here's my fridge](http://i.imgur.com/TWSx8zZ.jpg) with 4 days of breakfast, lunch, and afternoon snack prepped and in tupperware, and I split my fridge with a roommate.

I used to had the same problem with any rep after my first one, and it was because I wasn't shoving my hips back on the way down, so even if my first setup was great, the rest of my reps weren't.

<TEXT> It's less exact, but I just weigh/measure things uncooked and calculate the total calories that way. Then I visually guesstimate when I'm splitting into tupperwares. 

E.g. If I'm cooking 8oz of meat to split into 4 meals, I might accidentally end up with 2.2oz in one and 1.8 in another but no biggie - it's still 8oz over the course of 4 days. Then I'd just count it as 2oz of meat when I'm tracking each meal.

<TEXT> I think you might be overthinking things (which is easy to do... there's a lot of crazy and sometimes conflicting fitness and nutrition info out there).

The girl you posted has an insanely low bodyfat. It takes years and lots of hard work to achieve that. It also sounds like you more or less understand what you need to do - you lost weight before but didn't have a lot of lean body mass, so you're working on it now. That's great! It'll take a lot longer than a few months, though.

To end up "shredded" you need to have a fair amount of muscle mass + low body fat. People get there in multiple different ways (different sports, different training programs, different diets) so there is no one right answer. Pick what works for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's odd... it might be because MFP calculates your macro breakdown with percentages and then rounds them, rather than letting you input an exact number. I just added up mine, though, and my macros total 1551 calories while my goal is 1550, so it's almost exactly correct, just a bit of rounding error.

Pfftwe is correct, macros are really just a specific breakdown of your calorie goal, and each gram of carbs/fat/protein is worth a certain number of calories (1g of carbs = 4 calories, 1g of protein = 4 calories, 1g of fat = 9 calories), so your macro goals should always add up to your calorie goal. 

If you just slightly don't make it (you go over calories a little, or you have a few too many carbs/too few grams of protein) I wouldn't sweat it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anytime you're eating at a deficit, it's probably gonna suck a little tbh. Things that help me:

Meal planning and food prepping is a big one. I plan out meals for the week (or at least the weekdays) that fit my calorie/macro goals and then usually pre-cook several days' worth. If my breakfast/lunch/snack is already prepared for me, it's a lot harder for me to find a reason to go get something else. This also means when I grocery shop I know exactly what I need and I don't keep anything around that I don't need. 

I also eat a bunch of smaller meals ~3 hours apart. This doesn't work for everyone, but personally if I start to get a bit hungry, it's really helpful to remember that I only have another hour or so until my next meal. Some other people prefer intermittent fasting.

Overall I try to eat filling foods that are tasty and keep a small-ish deficit so I'm not too hungry. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Chicken salad made with greek yogurt instead of mayo. Obviously we all sub greek yogurt for everything all over the place but mayo's really got its own thing going on, and I was incredibly skeptical that I could just replace it entirely.

It was so good that I made and ate it three times in one week.

[Here's the recipe](http://showmetheyummy.com/greek-yogurt-chicken-salad/) - sorry for the crazy long blog post, the actual recipe is near the bottom.

Edit/PS: although kinda "healthy" due to the mayo/yogurt substitution, watch it with the cashews and craisins because that shit adds up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah that makes sense, and really it's one reason why these calculators will never be 100% accurate. "Exercise" means a million different things at different intensities. I would input 4 days of exercise and eat at the recommended deficit for at least a couple of weeks and see how it goes. If you're not losing weight, adjust it a bit lower - you'll have to do that throughout weight loss anyway, since your TDEE will go down as your weight goes down.

I'm eating 120-130g protein, 50-60g fat, and the remainder in carbs, which is about what IIFYM recommends for my bodyweight. </TEXT>

- a little more food on workout days, like you mentioned - doesn't have to be complicated, it can be as simple as adding a dessert or protein shake or something
- focusing your carb intake around gym time (carbs before/during/after the gym, and then low carb the rest of the day)
- bump your calories back up to maintenance for a month, then continue cutting

<TEXT> Yeah, it'll work (you may have to adjust a bit the closer you get to your goal weight, since TDEE estimates are just estimates, of course). The reason it's not usually recommended is because you have less control over the speed of weight loss. You might start out with a huge deficit and be really hungry/not do well in the gym/whatever, and then end up with a tiny deficit and lose weight frustratingly slow. But with 40lbs to lose, your initial deficit might not be too enormous (disclaimer: I didn't calculate it) so if it seems easier to manage, go for it. </TEXT>

My calorie and protein goals right now are around yours - personally I find it easiest to split up my protein intake into smaller, frequent meals rather than trying to eat a pound of chicken at once. I have a scoop of protein first thing in the morning, a scoop before bed, and then a small amount of eggs or meat at each meal. It feels... almost too easy.

It's then generally a good idea to dry the noodles a bit, otherwise they'll release of water when you cook them - I put mine in a strainer and squeeze them a bit and then let salt them and let them sit while I prep other ingredients.

<TEXT> Dunno why people downvoted you, I agree that this is sometimes where the "muscle turns into fat if you stop working out" myth comes from. If you're an athlete and used to eating like an athlete, and then you stop being an athlete but keep eating the same way, you end up fat. 

Obviously we all know this is from eating at a surplus + not maintaining muscle mass, not from muscles magically turning into fluff.

I went to "deadlift day" this weekend and it was absolutely amazing. I was there for 2 hours getting 1-on-1 coaching from a dude who squatted 750 in his prime. I was actually sick as a dog but went anyway and pulled 275 (a 10-lb PR) and it felt great.

They apparently also have a small 531 "class" that meets 3 times a week at night and is similarly structured - lots of individual coaching attention for a lot less $$$ than actual individual coaching. I'm in love and I think I'm going to switch when the next 531 cycle starts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In addition to the advice others have given, I'm also really intrigued by the concept of [decision fatigue](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html?_r=0). 

This is essentially the concept that when you wake up each day, you have a limited amount of energy dedicated to self control/willpower/making good decisions. So the more decisions you have to make throughout the day (should I go out for lunch? where should I go? what should I wear? should I go to the gym today? etc), the more easily you'll give into temptation later. Your brain is basically tired of making those decisions.

I'm experimenting on myself right now by planning and preparing all of my meals in advance, so there's no decision making, I just grab some tupperware. I'm finding it oddly easy to say no to snacks and drinks at work. YMMV but it's interesting. There's a TED talk somewhere too, I think. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agree. In general if you're trying to end up "shredded" you'll want to work on growing muscle and losing body fat in separate phases. It's difficult/slow to do those at the same time. This is why most people bulk and then cut.

So you could do that program to gain some muscle (high volume will do that), but you'll want to eat at least at maintenance if not a bit over. Once you've gained some muscle mass, then you'll cut calories to lose body fat. While you're doing that, it will be difficult to hit as much volume when you work out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No problem! It may not be the case for you but when I've had trouble hitting depth on heavier sets, it was really because I was sort of stopping myself from going deeper because it was so heavy. Deloading and box squats helped. Not being afraid to fail also helps.

You might also try "squat negatives" where you lower the weight in a slow and controlled way, like you normally would, but then just go as deep as you can, and then bail out safely (lower the bar to the safeties). Can you get down to parallel or lower? Can you get back up? May just be too heavy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can you get to that depth at any weight? (Goblet squats? Empty bar? Bodyweight?) How wide is your stance? 

With long legs (I have ridiculously long femurs, I feel your pain) it usually takes a combination of ankle mobility (oly shoes help but it might still take some work) and playing around with your stance to get there.

How close are you to wanting to compete? It's likely something that will improve over time.

<TEXT> Well, inches lost is great, even if you feel like you can't see it (it's hard to see slow changes) so keep focusing on that. 

However, even while lifting, a caloric deficit should lead to weight loss, especially such a large deficit. Do you have a food scale? Do you measure everything, including oils you use to cook, salad dressings, small snacks, etc?

I would actually shoot for a higher calorie limit to make sure you're properly fueled to get the most out of your workouts, but then make sure to religiously measure and weigh everything for at least a little while. I know from experience, it's really easy to forget about that little pat of butter you used to grease a pan, or the oil you drizzled on the veggies, which can easily add hundreds of calories. </TEXT>

- 2 oz of meat at lunch, snacktime, and dinner (~10-15g X 3)
- another scoop of protein + a tablespoon of peanut butter before bed (24 + 4)

Luckily only the handle hit me so I didn't lose a toe, but I guess I have heavy knives because it cracked my toenail in half and starting bleeding like crazy.

<TEXT> Agree with the other poster - the more you measure at home, the better you'll be at estimating elsewhere. Make a salad sometime at home and measure the greens, cheese, and dressing to give you a general sense of what you're getting at work. If you're trying to lose weight, it's better to overestimate (e.g. if you're not sure if you're eating 3 or 4 oz of chicken, go with 4).

If you want to add more protein, you could bring a tupperware of your own shredded chicken and leave it in the work fridge to add on top of your salad, and/or make a protein shake, assuming that still fits within your calories. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Examine.com is my go-to for any supplement questions:

http://examine.com/supplements/White+Kidney+Bean+Extract/

It does appear to work, but its potency is quite unreliable and relatively subpar.

 Human studies all show benefit in supplementation with the highest starch containing meal, although the degree of benefit seems highly variable. It is not recommended as a first-line fat burner due to it's inability to induce fat loss, but can be used as a band-aid supplement to a subpar diet like most calorie blockers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had anoles when I was a kid and absolutely loved them. A tank around that size (or even a bit smaller) worked fine, but they do need stuff to climb on and hide under, plus a heat lamp. And you have to feed them crickets and mealworms, if that weirds you out. But I used to take mine out and let them chill on my shoulder sometimes. They're cute and I loved having them as pets. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Abs have nothing to do with how much you can eat - see bodybuilders, with great abs and huge appetites!

But anyway, it's fine as long as you feel fine, more or less. If your activity/energy levels aren't impacted and you're getting enough protein, don't overthink it. If you start to struggle (which I predict you will at some point), eat a bit more.

My point was, the calorie count is not coming out to a lot because you're not eating a lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't time it, just take it like I'd take any vitamin or supplement. It's stored in your body so timing shouldn't really matter. It does make you retain water, I gain a few lbs, but the water is retained in your muscle tissue. I don't notice a visual difference, some people say they feel more "pumped." I feel like it helps my strength increase faster/easier, but YMMV. Here's a good amount of research-based info:

<TEXT> Honestly, religiously eating every hour seems like way more effort to me than just eating reasonably-sized meals, but it's up to you. No harm in giving it a try.

I think there's a happy medium to be found, personally... you probably don't need to eat hourly to avoid getting hungry. I find some amount of snacking to be helpful to me. For example, I know if I let myself get too hungry in the afternoon, I might make bad dinner decisions (I always plan my dinner, but I'm more likely to go nuts and order pizza if I feel starving), so a planned snack helps. But I'm talking maybe 1 or 2 snacks a day, outside of normal meals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many boxes of rice will specifically say cooked/uncooked in the nutritional info (e.g. 1/2 cup uncooked or 2/3 cooked). When in doubt, it's uncooked. Just measure the rice before you cook it.

Nutritional info for meat is also for the raw meat before you cook it, unless otherwise specified. If you have a food scale, you should be able to weigh exactly how much raw meat before you cook it, and then you can reference calorie counts per ounce (lots of sources online, or many food scales come with a reference book). If you don't have a food scale, you at least have a label with the total weight for the package of meat - divide logically into servings. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whenever I re-start taking creatine (sometimes I just forget for long periods of time) I tend to get a bit of indigestion but otherwise no side effects. It is known to cause some water retention, which won't necessarily make you look bloated (I think water is actually retained within muscle tissue?), but will tend to make you weigh a few lbs more.

Just get normal unflavored creatine (I get ON) - no idea what difference there would be in a "women's" version.

If she is worried about taking it, she can also try other things instead to help get her through cardio sessions. My understanding of creatine as a complete non-scientist is that the benefits tend to relate more to muscle recovery/growth/strength than cardio endurance (though it certainly wouldn't hurt). Something like increasing her carb intake before cardio might help as well. </TEXT>
