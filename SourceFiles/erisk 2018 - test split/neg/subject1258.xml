<TEXT> Hey so I'll be using colorful sharpies to start out with and then  yes, using awesome filters when I book/cover reveal. Might experiment around with putting the quotes in different places, ie, on grass, on flower beds, on an antique chair, etc. (I just  put up the first quote) - If you wanna take a look and tell me if it looks terrible, I'd love your genuine opinion. I'm terrible at Insta so feedback is great! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Feedback: Would you find an instagram account that just features quotes from books with a book reveal at the end of the week interesting?? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hey Guys!! 
Asking for your actual opinions. I love reading and blogging. If you're like me and a total snob who judges books by the cover--I have an idea.  I started an instagram account where I'll be posting quotes through out the week from one book and then do a book reveal on Fridays. The idea is the cover may be ugly, but the writing may be good. 
 
As really big book fans here, I want to know your opinion. Would this actually be interesting or is this just really stupid? Don't be shy, tell me how you really feel!  If you're confused the Instagram account I'm experimentally trying this out with is @firesidecoffeebooks. This is NOT a promotion. Please do not follow if you don't want to. Genuinely just looking for feedback.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a 25 female minority in the United States, yes I cried when the election results came out. A man who is constantly threatening people like my Muslim roommate who is the sweetest person I have ever know is now president-elect.

I moped, I cried. I felt anger and fear for my future when I woke up this morning realizing my political nightmare was reality.

No more. I'm done moping. I'm going to fight. I'm going to fight as a highly educated woman finishing her Masters' degree at a top school. I'm going to put aside my anger at uneducated America. I'm going to put aside my apathy towards studying hard that has been slowly growing this past year. I'm going to study damn hard because I need to be there for my fellow americans. Because knowledge is power and that is what I can contribute to the fight.

<TEXT> When I was small I had a baby blanket. Now, my mother was a smart woman and prepared for rips and bought two extra blankets of the exact same kind. Eventually when the second one really broke down at 16, my mom thought I'd finally move on to real comforter sets...well yes I did but I sure as hell made her give me that third baby blankie. At 25 years old, I still sleep with it every night and have no regrets  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Starting my first big girl job and the anxiety is overwhelming </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-02 07:08:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Let me back up a little. A couple months back I got hired at fast paced start up. I'm a grad student, but for some reason they still hired me when everyone else on  the team had been graduated at a PhD level for quite some time. I was fired on the third day as I wasn't meeting training expectations on my first try. Okay, fluke. Everyone tells me it's a fluke and no normal jobs expects you to know the ins and outs of a job before training. 

I've now been hired by the company of my dreams and I am SOSO anxious I'm going to be fired at the drop of a hat for any small mistake I make during training. My last experience makes me feel like I have to be 110% perfection or I will get fired. I can't stand the fact that I have to go through the learning process and that they could find me not "up to expectations. I'm so scared. I can't sleep. I can't eat...

To make matters worse, I'm just getting over an asthma episode from last week and my new co workers and boss saw how much of a toll work was taking on me my first day. They sent me home eith instructions to rest and come back in two days when I feel better so I don't relapse. I'M SO MORTIFIED. I can't believe I was sent home on my first day. The anxiety of not performing up to perfect expectations is eating me up!! AHH </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Finally, something I can respond to! 4 years ago I believed there was a ghost in the corner of my room. My lights would flicker...But my parents said it was a loose wire. Ok, I can get behind that. Then one day I'm specially nervous and this corner is just giving me the heebie jeebies. I go in to tell my mom exactly what's up and in the middle of me talking about it, every picture of me hung up in the house came crashing down...at the same time. We went downstairs to broken glass everywhere. 

My mom chalked it up to chance on the first one falling that caused vibrations and made the rest fall. Though if that was the case why didn't the rest of the family pictures fall? Needless to say, we never decided to talk about said creepy corner and entity again. No problems since but said corner still creeps the living shit out of me (probably more so now.)  </TEXT>

People who live in poverty but became  cocaine transporters to earn a decent living. some of these people got 25 years in prison. This pedophile guy wanted by interpol...got 6ish years? Did I get that right? An international child abuser got almost 3x less  jail-time??

It just hurts so much to know that Op breaking her 7 year relationship off with the man she loves is EXACTLY what Sara wants so OP can suffer along side her. 

I feel the need to say this because even if it doesn't work out, it might give you some closure and understand what was happening: couples therapy.

  You guys should  go. Breaking off a 7 year relationship isn't something you can just do cold turkey. Sincerely wishing the best for you OP </TEXT>

<TEXT> You reallly need to have a conversation with your bf. Sit him the fuck down and have a serious conversation about how you can't be with someone who doesn't treat you like you're worth it. Tell him the wrongs he's done and ask him "I don't see you changing, do you?"  based on his response decide to make the break. It seems you're kind of in the middle because he's a "fantastic guy",  but these are relationship breakers and depending on the way he reacts, make your move. I only suggest doing this because at least then, you can say you tried everything and made the most informed decision possible when you decided to break up. Good luck and be strong!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 
 Mom was a homeopathic doctor in her early years. I don't know about America, but in Asia, homeopathy is really big when western medicines don't work. I was not a believe, still not positive if i would try it again to be honest, but when I was 16 I developed junior rheumatoid arthritis. Nothing was working to help alleviate the pain (I live in the US and went to some really great doctors.) My mom eventually took me to see a homeopathic doctor in India who had been known to work miracles. I took his homeopathic medication (hesitant as I was because it made my mom happy.)  3 months later, I was SO MUCH BETTER. I could sit through classes, sleep through the night, etc. 

At least in Asia, a lot of the way homeopathy works is that you believe in it. You have faith that it works. So yea, it might be a placebo I don't really know, but I believe it helped me that once. 

Edit: grammar

Neither are bad necessarily, just very different. I'm on your side though. No big wedding for me. Ever. No.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> OP,
I'm not going to say "dump his ass" straight away. You have feelings involved, and that means you can't just walk away like this is nothing. Here is my honest suggestion? After he cools down, bring it up again and have a serious discussion about where that all came from. Explain your side of the story. Remind him you're not in a good place financially to buy him expensive gifts, but the amount of time u put in is by no means lazy. Ask him if money is the only way to show love? And finally, ask him why he keeps on bringing up this other girl. Straight up ask him if there is anything going on between the two of them. Also explain to him how hurtful for you and out of character that was for him. Lay everything on the table because communication is key here.

IF things go down hill, make sure to remind him that it would be difficult to move out right now because it would difficult, financially. If he's still an asshole about it, see if you can get your parents, other relatives, anyone to help you get out of the situation on the promise that you will pay them back. 
Good luck. Hope you update to let us know how you're doing and if you're ok!

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I go to a prestigious college which is pretty tough. That being said, I've always been really stressed but developed an anxiety disorder during my junior year and failed out of my program. I transferred to another program in school and was doing well..till now. I tried to take on a heavy course load to make up for the time I've been out of school dealing with anxiety. I was supposed to graduate in 5 weeks. Once again, anxiety reared its ugly head and screwed things up for me. I'm going to probably get a C in a class (Probably) and my GPA just can't handle that. Everyone is telling me to drop it and retake it in summer when I have more time to dedicate to it and I'm not taking 20 credits. I could do that but I'm SO SO SO scared what grad schools are going to think of me. I already had a problem with anxiety once before and had to Withdraw from 2 classes, how will a 3rd W on my transcript look. PROBABLY TERRIBLE. I've been SO SO anxious all day. I need to make a decision by the end of tomorrow and I'm just FREAKING OUT. I can't concentrate on homework at all. Either risk it and possibly get a C or B. Or just withdraw and definitely get a B or higher in summer. 
I'm so bummed about not graduating in 5 weeks. I feel like I've come so far with my anxiety and now I'm being set back again. I literally feel like there is no grad school that will EVER accept me. I  am SO angry at myself right now. Why couldn't I just handle it???? ARGH. </TEXT>

I understand how you feel, but please just explain to her why you're doing it and talk with her one last time ( if you can bring yourself too.)

<TEXT> I've heard this at least once for 3 days in a row and it bothers me a lot. I ate a canoli, had 2 beers, and  yesterday I kept on pulling snacks out every hour. Someone who I'd just met yesterday got pretty upset when I said having a hugh metabolism was a pain (she was a little on the chubby side.) But it's like hey, don't get mad at me, being super skinny has it's own set of problems too. They're just different. For instance, I don't have weight to lose if im sick. I have to almost be always constantly eating to keep up with my metabolism, I'm always hungery, I have to make sure to eat healthy bc I have no outside signs that junk food is bad for me. All I know is that in the long run, I'll regret it. I can't donate blood to my brother if he ever gets in an accident even though we have the same blood type of O-, sitting on hard surfaces is really uncomfortable because my butt is all bone and it hurts, I have to sometimes sleep with a pillow between my knees since I can feel my shin bones and it's uncomfortable when they touch. In short, don't underestimate skinny people problems. They are real for us too. Just a different set of problems. -_-

<TEXT> So these were my top 10 thoughts regarding the Oscars. I really hope some of you were thinking the same things...

1. Lady gaga looks normal? WHAT IS HAPPENING??
2. Julie Andrews, I love you. So much.
3. NPH, imagine yourself giving a speech in front of a crowd who is in their underwear...oh wait, never mind then.
4. Emma Stone, YOU LOOK SO SEXY. Also she is a sly minx. She is sitting in the perfect seat where everyone on their way up to accept their Oscar hugs her. If there was such a thing, she would win the award for most hugged by Oscar winners.
5. How come I know more movie score artists than actual movie things? Alexander Desplat and Hans Zimmer, this is your fault.
6. I should be doing homework, but damn Idina Menzel look so good. Can Frozen win another Oscar just because.
7. Can Leonardo DiCaprio win an honorary Oscar? HE JUST NEEDS ONE. PLEASE.
8. Why are you telling me that "the Oscars will continue in a moment, here on ABC." I obviously know that since I'm watching these stupid ads on ABC.
9. I apparently really need to watch Interstellar, Boyhood, The Imitation Game, Theory of Everything, and American Sniper. These Bitches are winning everything up in here.
10. Graham Moore. "thank you Oparah, um I need to shower, um" AHAHA HE'S SO CUTE.

Edit: Must add an 11. Because Jesus, did someone just mention Kristen Stewart in a thank you speech? WHY???

<TEXT> People who don't pay attention in class and then ask you 1 million questions.

I came home so annoyed today. I'm a senior at a good university. My classes are pretty hard and everyone expects that you get things on the first or second try. A lot of questions aren't asked. Today I'm sitting in class as we're learning A new computer system (I'm not an tech person so this was hard.) The three girls next to me are just talking on and on about who's dating who, and what color nail polish looks good with their shirts, and who's gonna cheat first, etc. while the professor is demonstrating how to use this system. When they learn that we have to turn in a guide for what we learned they start bothering the shit out of me to teach them how to do it when the professor is STILL lecturing. Then I MISS THE LECTURE because they won't stop bothering me, and now I  don't know what I'm doing. I end up asking professor during lecture, and everyone gets annoyed while girls continue to gossip, and the vicious cycle continued for 3 hours. JUST PAY ATTENTION. DAMN. 
Edit: for grammar and stuff. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im going to give you some popular YA books that are used a lot for getting people into YA. I recommend them to everyone who is looking to get into YA. They also happen to be about magic. 

The Graceling Series- Kristin Cashore

Poison Study -Maria V Snyder

Cruel Beauty- Rosamund Hodge

The Burning sky (more YA fantasy) 

Snow Like Ashes -sarah raasch

Seraphina - Rachel Hartman 

Personally, I think Red Rising is a little too heavy for an intro YA book, and unless you really like YA you won't be too into it. It is very good though if YA is your cup of tea. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would bring him into one appointment and have a health care professional help him talk through his concerns about vaccination. Have the doctor present the facts. Oh and talk to your doctor before hand so he or she has time to prepare the educational material they need. Sometimes people need a push from authority to see the light. Your husband may be one of those cases. Good luck and thank you for standing up for your child. Do NOT give in on this matter. Vaccines are SO SO important, but you know that :) </TEXT>

As the oldest grandchild and being a girl, I was treated like shit whnever I went to visit. Fyi, buddy, I'm not your servent and don't deserve to be treated terribly because I was born a girl. My mother felt the same way and we both decided we would not be attending the cremation. 
My ony regret is that it wasn't my grandmother who kicked the bucket. She's even worse. 


Edit: just read your comments below. I don't get how you feel, but instead of saying I'm sorry, I'll say congratulations on getting your life together. Congratulations on your mother dying.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Goodness that is scary! 
Often times, with a mental illness, talking through those monsters with someone helps fight them off. There is no better answer than "get help" but if she's not at that stage, she needs to be able to talk to you or someone else when she hers these monsters. 

Tell her to call you or be near you every time she hears those monsters. Your presence can help. 

This helped someone I know, I can only hope it helps your girlfriend. 

Don't try to talk her into psychiatric help when she's in a mood or she hears those voices. That's another tip. It will probably just make her angry. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I cannot believe TwoXChromosomes victim blames. [Rant] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-23 19:37:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>  Sorry in advanced for upset slightly whiney ranting.

This was my post on TwoXChromosomes for reference:

http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2n4b2h/i_was_roofied_and_it_was_terrifying_ladies_please/

I went there to tell people, yes roofies do get slipped into your drink no matter HOW careful you are. It DOES happen and to be careful.

What everyone made it about was, you're a liar, it's your fault, you clearly drank too much, you have no idea what you are talking about.

Can we just talk about victim blaming for a second? IT'S WRONG. My story doesn't add up? I'M SORRY I WAS FU****G ROOFIED. I don't exactly remember everything. Actually no, I don't remember ANYTHING. I have a doctor's note stating what happened? Nope, OP is still lying. I state there have been rare cases of BAC raising with roofies? NOPE, who cares about the 2% that it happens to, she just drank too much. Stop lying OP. I state I don't EVER go above my limits. I DON'T get drunk. PERIOD. I am a responsible 23 old who wants to have a good time and not get drunk? Nope, I'm lying because I clearly don't know how I behave. I asked my friends how much I drank? Nope, they're lying to me too. Or the hospital is lying. I probably wasn't roofied. I'M JUST FLAT OUT LYING AND IT'S MY FAULT. 

Ok, back to talking about Victim Blaming. It's not right. It's just not.  Telling a girl it's her fault for getting roofied. She doesn't  know what she's talking about? That totally makes the experience... I can't even think of the word- not real? Derogatory? I don't even know right now. 

On that note, I didn't know where else I could possibly post to just let girls know that shit like that does happen. But I don't even feel like my message got across. And now I feel shittier than ever. I KNOW it wasn't my fault I got roofied. I KNOW I only had two drinks. I double, TRIPLE checked with the people I was with. I also KNOW myself better than anyone else. But you  know what, now I FEEL like it was my fault. I FEEL super guilty. I don't know where else to post or where else to get support. It's the worst feeling in the world not be believed about something like this. I feel like just screaming my lungs out. I KNOW ME. I KNOW I didn't over drink. SOMEONE PLEASE FUCKING BELIEVE ME. 

tldr; had two drinks, got roofied. Posted on TwoXChromosomes to let ladies know this shit does happen and asking them to be careful. Got Victim Blamed to hell- delegitimizing my experience and I feel like shit.

Edit: Yes, it's fine let the downvoting begin. They're just internet points for goodness sake. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ladies and gents. 
I honest don't care if you think I'm lying. If you think I drank more than I did. If you think this story isn't adding up. If you want to bash me, whatever. I know how much I drank. Telling me I'm lying, telling me I don't know what I'm talking about, it's rude. And I'm not going to victim blame myself or second guess myself. I didn't write this post to get into and argument with people about whether I'm lying or not. Frankly, I thought TwoXChromosomes would be a lot more supportive, but that's also okay. I also won't be bothering to pay attention to anymore posts that attempt to tell me I'm lying. I have enough of guilt on my shoulders that I let this happen in the first place. 

What I wanted to get across here was WATCH YOUR DRINKS. This shit happens in real life. It can literally happen to anyone in any situation. I thought I was a pretty careful person but this still happened. I don't want to hear it happen to other girls. Cover your drinks with your hand, don't put down your drinks, If you leave a drink unattended,don't finish it and get a new one. That is all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [23/F]
Ladies. It can happen to anyone. I am a responsible adult. Yes I drink, but I never go over my limit. Never get blacked out, never drink more than is dangerous, never got in trouble. I was/AM a good girl. I social drink and that's about it.
I went to ONE house party 2 nights ago. Just one. The first time I've gone to a house party all year. It was a friend of a friend's. I poured my own drinks, kept it in hand. I was being safe. When the host turned off the lights for 5 minuts, I thought nothing of it. I was just chilling with my glass in hand, people bumping into me occasionally. What no one knew was that I decided to leave the party early because I was tired and wanted to stop drinking. I left and went to a bar to just hang out and meet other chill friends. Next thing I know, I'm on the bathroom floor unresponsive. They took me to the hospital and said I was really lucky I left. They said I'd been roofied and that I had a bad response to the roofies mixed with alcohol. My Blood alcohol level (from just having two drinks) shot up to .28 I'm lucky I didn't finish that drink or I would have been even worse. That's pretty high and that's when they knew there was something wrong IF I was not lying about the two drinks (which I swear I wasn't.) 

Main points: it was terrifying, it was scary, I still have a headache two days later, and I am absolutely terrified to drink again, let alone go outside again. I know I was lucky. I don't even want to imagine what would have happened If I had stayed at that house party or if I had had a normal reaction to roofies. I could have been assaulted or raped. Thank god I wasn't.

My mother believes and supports me without question. She has been fantastic. My other relatives....they think I'm an alcoholic and a slut. I can't change that and it sucks.  They don't believe I was roofied. They think I drank too much and am lying about the drugs. I'm not. This shit happens in real life. 

The guilt sucks. You know it's not your fault, but someone you just feel like in some way it is. Why did I have that drink? How did I let myself get roofied? Was I really dressed in a way that made guys think I was easy? I know, it's not my fault, but the guilt doesn't go away so easily. 

Ladies, PLEASE be careful. I'm begging you.

EDIT: to normal BAC scale

EDIT 2: No, I won't be pressing charges, but I DID tell the police and local campus security exactly where it happened, and to deal with it as they saw appropriate. Why I'm not pressing charges was a decision I made myself. I want to remain annonymous and I want to put it behind me. I told the police because I didn't want it happening to other girls. Other than that, I want to put this behind me. Please respect my decision. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This contains major spoilers, so don't read this if you haven't read HoF.

Ok, please tell me some of you on reddit have read the third book in the series because I literally just finished it this morning and cannot concentrate in any of my classes. Oops. 

1. WHAT THE HEC CALAENA AND CHAOL? Mass basically uilds up their relationship from book one and we finally see them together in book two and everything is glorious. And at the end, you're like ok, he's mad, she's mad, they'll get over it. BECAUSE THEIR LOVE IS ETERNAL.  And then, without even meeting each other He knows it'll hurt but decides to get over her and she takes of her amethyst ring and feels a weight lifted of her shoulder.
No. NO NO NO NONONONO.  Stop it. Don't just build up their relationship and tear it down without them even meeting. One problem, and they call it quits. No working it out, nothing. STOP. MY SOUL IS CRYING. I CAN'T TAKE THIS.

2. Anyone else ticked that Sorscha was just used as a plot device to spur Dorian into action. After Sorscha came in, I just cannot see  Calaena and Dorian together ever again. WILL HE NEVER GET HIS HAPPY ENDING??

3. Chaol, why are you such a god damn Wimp. PULL IT TOGETHER  MAN. AHHH

4. Rowan. Rowan was such a great addition. The only way I will forgive Mass for breaking up Chaol and Calaena is if she get together with Rowan. God, they were such a dynamic duo.  The bantering, the love. STOP TELLING ME THEY ARE FRIENDS. YOU KNOW THEY AREN'T. 

5. Mannon. What a bad ass. I didn't like her stories at first,  but it grew on me.  And Abraxos. What a sweetheart. 3

HOW DO I CONTROL ALL THESE RAGEY FEELING!??! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Listen, it's better to do this when the kids are younger, after they're grown out of their baby stage and before teenage years. This gives them time to adapt while they're still young. It will be hard at any age, but I'm sure with your support after the divorce by showing them you still love them and can now concentrate on being an even better father versus worrying about your marriage...they'll appreciate it later on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was awesome.

After being in a two year relationship, I was really feeling down, sad, etc. You know the drill. My friend URGED me to get a vibrator. I was so hesitant at first. I just felt so embarrassed to use a sex toy. Was I really that needy/desperate??? Yes I was. And it was worth it.

So I bought one and...I LOVE IT. How did I live without one for so long!? Why did I depend on others to give me this feeling when I could do it on my own twice as fast!? I'm feeling so much sexual freedom right here you guys, ahhhh! 

I just had to share the story, and thought this was the best place to post :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> you are in the EXACT same situation I was in...exactly one month ago. Wow. I didn't even notice today was the day.  My ex-SO was really hurt and sad about it too and pretty much said the same things to me. I also cried and hurt so SO much. I still hurt. But listen. The first two weeks are definitely the hardest. I STRUGGLED to get through them. Let me tell you my do's and don'ts maybe they will help me.

DO
1. Spend every waking moment with friends possible. It helps keep your mind of things.

2. If you like exercise do that. WITH PEOPLE. I like dancing. So I went clubbing. A LOT. 

3. make a list of things you gave up that you enjoyed (maybe unintentionally) and will now strive to do those things. Make them short terms goals. Not oh, i'll do them soon. Say, I'll do them at THIS day with THIS person. Make the plans real.

5. Do eat healthy. it helps. really it does. Also fluids. You've been crying a lot.

6. DO let yourself mourn. Take some time off whatever you are doing. Relax in the evening. Don't try to do hw (if you're still in school) if you don't have to. Take time to rest and do other things. Forcing yourself to act like everything is normal doesn't work. It's not. You have to make a new normal routine and that's why you can work on.


~~DON'T~~
1.Don't let him define your life. He let you go. He let go of someone that would have never given up on him. You are letting someone go that was more than willing to give up on you. 

2. Don't sit in bed and think. You will just cry. I liked to get my mind of it and read. Unlike tv, reading takes actual concentration and you will soon find yourself taken by the plot. I can suggest you SO many books. Just tell me what you like if you are interested.

3. Don't talk yourself out of going out with other friends. You need this so much right now. Talk it out with them. Let your feelings go with them. Spend time with them when you were supposed to spend time with him. Soonish...the times you were supposed to be with him will be associated as time with your friends. I'm only one month into my break up and i'm telling you this helped me the most.

3. DON'T SLEEP. if you can't. 4 hours of good sleep is better than lying in bed for 9. It won't always be like this. Trust me. Get up, read, journal, color, watch tv, whatever. DO NOT just try to sleep with your  mind full. I just stayed up slept when i was sleepy. Like to the point i was so sleepy I couldn't think anymore. It's ok to let yourself do this for a while. It won't always be like this. You'll go back to getting normal sleep soon. It really did help for the first two weeks though.

Now...I have a lot of anxiety. And most people say DON'T do this...but it really helped ease my anxiety. 
My ex-SO and I decided to continue texting after our breakup. BUT ONLY to alleviate feelings. Like hey i REALLY miss you. IS this right? etc. I miss sleeping with you. I miss watching this show with you, i miss your smile, etc. He would in return usually say something along the long page. Because it's not like he didn't care. He missed me too and it hurt him to break up with me. BECAUSE OF THAT REASON, we were able to share the pain of the break up with each other and get over it together. Soon, the texting got less, and emotions are not as strong and I barely text him anymore. But it helped SO MUCH at first. Because you are in my same situation, I recommend you talk with your SO and see if this is an option for you. Rather than going cold turkey. That would have given me SO MUCH anxiety..

lastly, FEEL FREE to PM me. I will talk with you. I will support you. PLEASE. DO. THIS. 

Lots of love and positive vibes. You are strong girl. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If any of you haven't read it, I just finished Exquisite Captive by Heather Demetrios
[link]https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18106985-exquisite-captive

This book was just SO SO powerful. The characterization was complex, the world building was on spot. A few too many flashbacks and get this, the "villain" is part of the love triangle- which was written SO spectacularly. I hate love triangles, but gods, this one REALLY worked. It pulls at your heartstrings SO much. Every lover of YA lit Romance and fantasy needs to read it and fan girl with me here. My heart strings are still being tugged on from the aftershock of the ending. 
PLEASE READ IT. AND THEN MESSAGE ME SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT. I know you will want to. Trust me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just finished reading Exquisite Captive by Heather Demetrios.

The part at the end where [spoiler](/s Malek, the villain that he gave up his evil villainous ways because he knew he could either have ultimate power or Nalia's love. And he chose Nalia's love. AND THEN SHE BETRAYS HIM. And his heart breaks and he turns evil and cold again.) It just broke my heart SO MUCH. MY SOUL IS CRYING. BUT IN A GOOD WAY. FOR The characterization is so complex and real. My heart still hurts from the raw emotion of that scene. 
For anyone who wants a fantasty romance that leans towards a slightly more mature audience, this is for you. If you do happen to read it, please hit me up and mourn with  me. I'm dying a little on the inside. It was SUCH a powerful seen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys,
My friend does read, but not often. She is a very mature put together type of person and loves romance. Doesn't really read YA but I feel like she would enjoy some of the more mature ones. I'm deciding between three books right now:
1) Darkfever -Karen Marie  Moning
2) Dragonfly - Julie Golding
3) The Graceling - Kristin Cashore 

Votes? Any other opinions?

Another one that just popped to mind is Anna and The French Kiss </TEXT>

<TEXT> This literally JUST happened to me.

My boyfriend of almost 2 years just broke up with me overnight saying he was so stressed out with work and trying to find a job that he couldn't do this relationship anymore. It was just adding on  to the stress. I feel like my heart has been torn out. He was my best friend and made me laugh and smile like no one else could.
I've just been sitting her all morning eating chocolate. 

I just called up a bunch of  my friends and told them "hey, here's what's going on. Can we meet up. I don't want to be alone." They all readily agreed. The first week is always the worst, or so I've been told.

If you ever need someone to talk to, let me know. Maybe we can help each other out. Lots of love and support.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> lip blams in general are good moisturizers if used around 3 times a day or less.However, if used too much, they dry out your lips and your lips become dependent on them for moisture. Also, your lip skin cells have trouble regenerating. The progress becomes slow.  Right now I usually can't go more than half an hour without lip balm without my lips cracking, peeling etc. That is why i'm trying to get out of the addiction.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Day 6 of breaking my Chapstick addiction. IT HURTS. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-04 19:10:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> At first it started well. Everyone told me to use coconut oil and my lips felt so nice. Starting on day 5 they just started peeling and hurting like crazy. My lips feel so tight it's hard to smile. I want to give up and use chapstick. Will they ever be soft again!? Will they ever stop peeling? How much exfoliation till all this dead skin is gone! I know this all takes time, but it's driving me crazy. Ahh. End Rant. 

Edit: With a lot of the information you guys have given me, I guess my status has changed more to, how do I get my lips healthy enough to only be using lip balms only 3-5 times a day. I'm still going to try for this goal and stick with shea butters and oils. It just seems that this is so impossible with the way my lips are  now. I'm so afraid they'll bleed and crack forever! </TEXT>

Sperm have to swim quite a ways to even get to the egg after being inserted into the vagina. In addition, they are pretty weak in terms of temperature variation and die very quickly if outside the body. Hope that helps relieve your worries!  </TEXT>

my equation is:  (x) (.015 + x)/ (2.00-x)(2.00-x) = 10

Now I know I need to get this into quadratic equation form...but when I factor it out i get  .015x + x^2/ x^2 - 4x + 4

...so that being the case, I'm getting stuck on how to get it into the ax^2 + bx + c form with two x^2s that should (in my mind cancel out.) once ik what to do, then I can solve on my own! </TEXT>

At the same time I feel a little bad for the mother. Yes, the kid is a brat. But what if SHE was having a bad day, and just wanted her kid to shut up. You can't force your  kids to behave. You can try your damned hardest to discipline them and hope they learn, but sometimes there are just some honest to god annoying kids. Now she has to listen to this stupid kid wine his head of forever.

Despite me feeling a little bad for the mother, I'm still really happy the kid didn't get the pie. Fuck him. 

PS- i was a terrible kid and made my mother suffer humiliation and embarassment wherever she took me. I feel bad for her. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-07-08 02:57:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, gotta rant.
So, my parents usually pay my university fees. Ofc, I  offered to pay them here at school but they said no I wasn't responsible enough to pay  (all the while bitching about the credit card fee they have to pay b/c i "refuse" to pay at school.)

Times comes where I'm taking summer classes at a different university and I'm asked to pay the fees. I email the department and ask when they are due. They tell me the day classes start is the first day of fees.

So, I go to pay- and yet again my parents tell me I'm not allowed and they'll pay from home. So then they see a late fee of 2 months and start yelling at me about why i didn't know it was due at the beginning when I registered just like my primary university. I calmly explain that I wouldn't know since they deemed me to irresponsible to be worthy of that knowledge and they never let me pay. So, how would I know??

But no - i'm too irresponsible too pay and i'm also more irresponsible because I didn't know. 
Now they are checking my credit card statements EVERY DAY. And asked my why I had to buy a can of coke today when I had a late fee of 90 dollars. Don't I feel guilty? 

Edit: sorry, I spelt "you're" wrong in the title.  
And i'm not working for the next two months b/c my schedule can't fit it and the place is closed for renovations till fall.

tl;dr: I just want to learn to control my financial account; but I'm too irresponsible for that, and I'm even more irresponsible when I try for the first time because I don't know how. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [College- Gen Chem 2] - Mole Ratios   molality </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-07 00:23:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have two questions here that i'm just NOT getting the right answer to.

Edit: My work shown:
 
1. what is th emole ratio of benzene (C6H6) to n-octane in the vapor above a solution of 10% benzene and 90% n-octane by mass of 25 degrees C. Vapor pressure of n-octane and benzene at 25 degrees C. are 11 torr and 95 torr respectively.  The answer is supposed to be: 1.4

work: converted 10 g  -- mol:  10g x 1mol/78.11 = .128 mol C6H6
same thing for n-octane: 90 g x 1mol/114.23 = .7878

Then took .128/(.128 + .7878) = .1395
 and: .7878/(.128 +.7878) = .8602

.1395(11torr) + .8602(95 torr) = 22.739 torr.  ---- I thought that was the answer



2.  If the  boiling point of a sample of formation of H2O is 2.3 degrees C. above the boiling point of pure water, what is the molality of dissolved particles in the sample.
Answer is supposed to be 4.4 m.

Work:   2.3 degrees Celcius/m  x .52 m = 1.196 m.    -- what i thought the answer was

Thanks so much! </TEXT>

Mg (s) + 1/2 O2 = MgO (s) + light

The energy change that accompanies this reaction is -602 Kj/mol MgO. Calculate the lattice energy of MgO from the following energy changes. 

Given:
Mg (s) -- Mg (g) = enthalpy change of 150

O2 (g) -- O2 (g) = enthalpy change of 499

Mg(g) -- Mg2+ (g) + 2e- = enthalpy change of 2188

O(g) + 2e- -- O2- (g)

<TEXT> Hello,
This is the problem I have with lexapro as well. I've been taking it for...a year now and it has also done wonders for me in terms of anxiety and depression. I'm a pretty small person. Before lexapro I was a very small eater.  I weighed around...82 pounds (i'm 5'2" btw). But once i started taking lexapro and the pill combined, I suddenly got a huge appetite and I didn't know what to do. And i HATE being hungry.

My solution:
All foods don't have to be bad. I started eating smaller meals more frequently instead of 3 big meals through out the day, so I would stay full. If i wanted a snack between  my 4-5 meals a day I made SURE (on most days) that it is healthy and low calorie. Some of my favorite options:
1. pita chips   hummus
2. Frozen Blueberries (great in summer)
3. A hot pocket
4. salted edamame beans
5. half an avacado with sea salt and olive oil.

changing my diet stopped me from packing on pounds and having an increase of fatty foods. 

If you ever want to talk about other symptoms or have questions about lexapro, feel free to message me! </TEXT>

<TEXT> that's right on the mark. My mother is Indian and was always raised on the the perception that you are useless without your virginity. "he took it away from me." That's not true. We talked about it- no peer pressure at all- and I actively made the decision that this was something I wanted for myself. Also, I'm 22 and not getting any younger :p </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently had a talk with my mother, again. After deciding to have my first boyfriend, EVERY single time I go home, it's always: "Have you had sex yet?" I got fed up and told her it wasn't her business what I chose to do. Just that she should know that whatever I chose to do, she should trust me enough to know that I'll always take precautions and be safe. 
She responded with "That's bullshit. You're my daughter. I have a right to know whatever you are doing and goes on with your body. It came from me and if you are having sex, I need to know every detail of when you become unpure."
That really hurt. I thought my body was my own. 

Then, when my boyfriend and i got into a fight, all my mom cared about was whether I had sex. "I just need to know that your body is still pure." As long as it is pure, your father and I will be ok." What about me? What about my heartbreak? What about how I feel about my virginity? WHY DO YOU THINK YOU OWN MY BODY. WHY DO YOU THINK MY SEXUAL BUSINESS IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE RIGHTS TO? It's hurtful.

It should be that easy, but instead it's virgin men aren't real men. Virgin women, are prude. Non Virgin women are unpure. WHY IS THERE NO WINNING? Something that is a personal choice, no matter what your age, has become such a shameful and humiliating thing to so many in our societies. It's just sad.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> i think it really depends on how traditional of a family your parents came from.
For example: my father came from a pretty strict and traditional family. He can get seriously angry and violent. No funny business around him when I grew up. My dad always thought i should bow down and listen to my elders.

My mother on the other hand, came from a non traditional family who raised her with a lot of patience and love. All the funny business around her. My mom always  told me to respect my elders, but to stand up for myself and respect myself no matter what.

The two came together and my dad was always pretty angry and strict with us. Adhered to tough love. My  mother raised us with a  lot of unconditional love and forgiveness.

How on earth do i solve when there is an exponent such as 3x-2? How do i bring it down? Would someone take me step by step?
Solve for x. Find the exact solution to the equation below. (Do not give a decimal approximation

54e^(2x+3)=28.

#2: exact same instructions...how am i opening it out to solve for x? How am i getting x alone here?
log(2x)log(3+x)=2.

<TEXT> Books by Eva Ibbotson are great!

1. Which Witch
2. Island of the Aunts (my personal fave)
3. Journey to the River Sea

Almost Anything by Bruce Coville, but I highly recommend:

1. Jeremy Thatcher Dragon Hatcher
2. My Teacher is an Alien
3. Into the Land of the Unicorns (if you want a slightly girly book)


I also argue that the first 3 Harry Potter books are good for all ages.

1.Junie B Jones series
2.Captain Underpants series
3.The Boxcar kids series
4.Magic Tree House series
5.Chronicles of Narnia series
6. Encyclopedia Brown series

Stand alone books:

1.Where the wild things are
2.Frindle
3.The Doll People
4.Howliday Inn

I really like reading. </TEXT>

Bailaban b/c dancing is a continuous activity. It's not something *BAM* and done.

**Llevaban - b/c they didn't just put the clothes on and off right. Wearing the clothes was a continuous activity!!

Tomaron - taking a photo is a *BAM* action - it happens in like 5 seconds and it's done. 

Celebraban - celebrating is a continuous activity. 

** The key here when is remembering that that preterite is a *BAM* action. It happens very quickly: Ie, emotions, taking a photo, jumping, etc.

Imperfect are for continuous activities: celebrating a holiday, when you were a child, loving your parents, taking ballet lessons, etc.  </TEXT>

I just don't put on weight. At all. Like ever. In fact, if I'm not constantly eating and stuffing my face- I lose more weight. Most of my efforts go to at least maintaining my weight. And no, I don't have any parasitic worms. My doctors have checked multiple times. Also, I don't over exercise, hec, I've barely exercised at all this year. I am super healthy.  Yale needs to STFU.

(1.)  Suppose 33 g of water is irradiated with photons of wavelength 5.00E-4 m. Assume that the radiation is absorbed  and then converted to heat. How many photons will be required  to raise the temperature of 33.0 g of water by 13.1 degree C. 

My Answer:  4.55E24 photons
How I did it: Delta H of water (33 g) x 4.184 J/gc x 13. 1 C = 1808.7 J

Energy of photon: hc/ wavelength : 6.626e-34 x 3.00e8 / 5.0e-4 = 3.975ee-22 J

1808.7 x (1 photon/ 3.975e-22 J)  = ANSWER: 4.55e24 photons


(2. )The photoelectric work function ( energy threshold) for calcium is 4.34e-19 J. Light of wavelength 405 nm shines on a piece of calcium metal. If one photon can eject an electron, what is the speed of the electron? ( assume that the electron's mass is equal to its rest mass.) phi = work function

ANSWER: 6.51e-38 m/s

HOW
 V =c/wavelength    (1) 
E= hv - phi    (2)
Kinetic Energy= 1/2mv^2  (3)


V = 3.0e8 / 4.05e-7 m = 7.41e14 

E = 6.626e-34  x 7.41e14  minus 4.34e-19 = 5.70e-20 J

Kinetic energy = 1/2 (40.08 = calcium mass) x (5.70e-20)^2 = ANSWER: 6.51e-38 m/s


(3. )What color will this photon be?
ANSWER: Violet?????

(4.) What energy will the photon be? (wavelength =  405 nm -- 4.05e-7 m)
ANSWER: E = hc/wavelength = 4.91 J ?

(5. )What would teh energy of a moe of these photons be?

ANSWER 2.96e24 J

HOW: (6.022e23 photons/ 1 mole  of photons) x (4.91 J/photons) - 2.96e24 J

(6. )What is the wavelength of the emitted electron?

E = hv/ wavelength.      v = velocity

ANSWER:1.32E51 m

HOW:  5.70E-20 J / (6.626E-24 x 6.51e-38) = 1.32E51 m

<TITLE> Not sure how to do this type of problem with percentage yield. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-02-14 04:33:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ok, I know how to find a percentage yield when I have a certain amount of grams, with an excess of another,  and an actual yield given to me.

This problem has no excess but grams of 2 compounds and an actual yield...i'm not sure what to do with the second compound...
Here is the equation:

15.0 g methane and 10.0 g carbon monoxide were placed in a vessel. What is the theoretical yield of acetic acid if actual yield is 19.1? What is the percentage yield? 

CH3OH (l) + CO (g) -- HC2H3O2     (already balanced)

So if it was just 15.0 g of methan with excess CO, i would know what to do, but with two compounds, I don't know. Any help would be appreciated. thanks!!

<TEXT> dearest OP,
I currently am going through some tough times right now as well. While they aren't over, maybe it'll make you feel better to know you aren't alone. After being at the top of my class, in the honors program, and class president, I got discriminated by a teacher verbally and emotionally over and over again. Just brought my self confidence to an all time low. I developed panic disorder, lost my position on council, got kicked out of the program as senior in college, and now I have to start all over in another major when I thought I was going to graduate this year at the top of my grade.

Though I can't get over it,  learned to COPE. I talked to friends, I started to take life day by day and stopped planning into the future unless i really needed to. I tell myself I'm beautiful everyday, I tell myself I'm not worthless - even thought sometimes I don't believe it, but you know - sometimes I do. 
I don't know what kind of advice to give you, but you aren't alone in tough times :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, in general, I understand the concept of a net ionic equation, as well as, how to do them. I understand that you do not break up a solid, liquid, or gas.  What am i confused about, is that when trying to figure out if it's S, L, G, or Aq - I have no clue how. 
If all the reactants and products are Aqueous how am i supposed to know what breaks up and what doesn't to create your equation. 
Yes I can use a solubility chart, but I feel like i'm missing something.
1 examples
NaClO(aq) + HBr(aq) NaBr(aq) + HClO(aq)

These are all aqueous. What breaks apart on the product side.
I know the first side is Would NaBr stay as NaBr? Or would it be Na2+ and Br2- or would it be HClO- or H+ Cl+ O+ 

fjfkda; HAALP.

Well, my parents want me to get someone I don't know from India ( i live in the US) by the time I'm 26. Btw, I'm 22 right now (and so is my boyfriend.)  I'm not very happy with the idea, but they said that is IF i CAN'T find someone in the US who they approve of. My boyfriend and I are currently in a long-term relationship Looking to stay together. As for marriage, I honestly don't know and couldn't say because we're at the end of our college lives and that brings about soo many changes.
All I know is, I REALLY don't want to be in an arranged marriage. I'll fight it tooth and nail.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Indian girl here who grew up in the US. Listen, my parents want me to get an arranged marriage too. I don't know how I feel about that. I know where you are coming from.

ANYWAY, I entered my first relationship this year, and it embarrassed me a LOT that I didn't know the first thing about relationships and my BF had been in so many relationships before.
You know what changed me from being an insecure pathetic creature?
When my BF told me it's not a one way street. 

Basically, your happiness matters too. Yes, you want to make him happy, but STOP THINKING ABOUT HIM FOR A SECOND. If you can't be happy, how can you make someone else happy? 
Also, learn to accept a compliment, it makes life a lot easier. Trust me, I've been there. 

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> You aren't abnormal at all! It can take a lot more time than just 4 to loosen up. As everyone has said previously, a water-based lube really helps (it was a gift from the gods for me.) And just go slow, I found it pretty painful almost always and have to really slow at first, but after the first initial 5 minutes, I'm good! Also, if the problem is with how tight you are at first, try (or have your partner) finger you a lot. It can really help!
Remember,  your body is yours and unique. No one else can tell you exactly what will help, but I hope everyone's comments to give a good direction to go into! Good luck! Happy sex life! </TEXT>

Since i'm not a doctor and I've never met you- no one on reddit could accurately diagnose you, but i will say that Schizophrenia can come i many different forms, including being as "mild" as just a voice. Don't freak out though, it really  may just be stress. On another note, if you generally do not think these voices are yours, have you ever tried ignoring Flynn? Pretending he isn't there? What happens? 

2. Don't ever think you are crazy. Having a mental health problem never makes you crazy. Just like a physical illness doesn't make anyone a freak. Take care of your mental health, it's just as much a part of you as your physical body is. Ok? :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> First things first. If you don't have a support network, find one.
Your friends at school are a great one - if you have some good ones, I'm sure they'd be more than happy to help you cope and help around the house with things you don't know. Maybe they just don't know how to approach you right now. Ask and find them.

Second - relatives, they may be farther and harder to get a hold of, but can your grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins - anyone who you'd typically have over for chistmas -can they help you? Can you move in with someone? Can they  move in with you for a bit and help you get back on your feet?

Another point-  Did your parents have a lawyer? See what they left you? Life insurance?  Wills? etc. Did they leave any information on what to do as a landlord etc in case they ever passed?

fourth - what about school? I know this may not be the right time to think about it when you are grieving, but if you were in school, take a break but don't forget about it. It's important for your future. Don't get held down my these weights that have been forced on you. Keep going to school if you can afford to. 

If you ever need anyone to talk to, please PM me! Sending some more Michigan love to you. Be strong but not too strong. It's ok to ask for help. </TEXT>

Rape Insurance. This law sends the message that I should be anticipating rape. We are not being taught that rape is bad, we are now taught that we should anticipate it.
This will only bring about illegal abortions and harm to woman who can't afford them. 59 government officials and over 300,000 people voted for this to pass. I'd like to know how many of those people read the whole document and didn't just jump at the word "anti-abortion." </TEXT>

In my brain of  brains as a poor college student, I say this is ridiculous and unfair. Why should people who haven't even been educated get paid more than  some people who have taken the time to educate themselves. I mean a lot of entry level after college jobs don't 't even pay that much. You know what I'm saying? If they got paid that much without going to college, I feel like I'd start to think, why did i just waste all that money when I'm getting that kind of pay?

<TEXT> As a person who will TRY to see the best in this situation, I won't say dump his ass just yet. You guys have been together 4 years and if this is the first time he has been cruel, DO NOT forgive him, BUT DO find out why he acted like that once he has cooled off, DO MAKE SURE to get an sincere apology from him, and DO MAKE SURE he knows he can never ever treat you like that again, or make it VERY clear you will dump  his ass. 
I say give him a second chance, but that's it. No more if he does it again.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks, i'm really taking that with me. I've decided that no matter what, I don't need to add depression to the anxiety. Whatever happens, i've come a long way and learned a lot. I'll just start over in a place where people deal with anxiety and help students that have it. Maybe the University of Michigan just wasn't for me. Thanks for hearing my story and giving me some courage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> to me it sounds a lot like  shock actually, which is a little different than panic attack. Of course panic attacks treat everyone different, but when panic sets in, generally people get very hot, sweating, etc.
While, in shock, people tend to get more cold and start shivering. </TEXT>

<TEXT> yes, it definitely is. I wasn't depressed when my doctor prescribed prozac for me. I just had GAD and Panic disorder.  
Unfortunately Prozac didn't work for me because I had the SE Of losing a ton of weight (and i'm pretty tiny for my age) so he switched me to lexapro :p

Lexapro is an SSRI and it works really well for me. I went from having Panic attacks 4-5 times a week to maybe once a week or none at all. SSRI's are great! Let me know if you have any specific questions :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, first of, let me start by saying, it's nice to know that I'm not the only one here. Knowing you guys are facing your own battles AND WINNING, gives me strength. Let me share my story now.

I'm a nursing student and my clinical instructor saw I was having some anxiety and clinical. So she set up a 4 part plan to help me.  The last step was to go into a room that REALLY scares me...this is the the room where I started having panic attacks two years back. I agreed with 3 of the 4 step plan and told her that I was really uncomfortable with the 4th step. That it wouldn't help me and that anxiety doesn't just go away that easily. You can't just put someone in front of their stimulant and just expect things to get better, nevertheless, she did.

I went into that room today...and I was doing well until half way through. Then one word from an instructor on just turning an IV bag upside down and I froze. I was useless. I became excessively hot, sweating, shaking finger, heart palpitations, the works. 
I'm just so frustrated because I've done so well so far and this one thing brought me down. Just came for a little support and ranting here. Thanks guys. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys,

So I've just been put on clinical warning for my weakness in critical thinking? 
What will help me? In short, I usually go in in the  morning, hear patient report, and then start prioritizing. I then start to think
- what is the admitting diagnosis
-what needs to be done for this patient and why?
- Why are we giving these meds and what do they do?

What ELSE do I need to think about? I'm just so frustrated here.

Should i be looking at their history? What am I looking for?
What else should I worry about?
fjdklas AHHHH.

Edit: I'll be a senior in January, so I'm pretty high up here. </TEXT>

Suddenly and ikea representative comes in and puts her hand on the curtain and says "let me show you this particular  bath tub" and opens it half way and the couple says they dont' want to see it. So without looking at the bathtub, the representative closes the curtain and walks  out. Had she just turned around, she would have seen us.

<TEXT> Depending on where you live, LAYERS. One of you classes may be in a building that is stuffy and hot. Another may be in and ice box. Again, LAYERS.

Realize that everyone you meet during welcome week will most likely be your college friend group. If they are, great, but if not, join clubs that you are interested in and friendships will come easy

Don't drink if you don't want to - no matter what peer pressure you get. Remember you are not the only one not drinking. Chances are, at least 40% of the people around you aren't drinking either. 

Don't freak out if your GPA goes lower in college. IT HAPPENS and it's pretty much natural. Just try to get it as high as you can your freshman year, because things will get harder.

Force people to walk you home at night. Do NOT let them guilt you into walking home alone. 

You will have to work. HARD (most likely unless you are a super genius.) Get into the habit of not studying for tests the day before. It will kill you in college. 

ENJOY. Learn to be independent. RELAX, you'll do great!! GL. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Two tips:

1. find out what your one make-up vice is. What do you REALLY like and just makes you feel good and confident? Carry it around with you in your cute little purse, even if you don't use it a lot. Having it there just makes you feel feminine. (mine is lip gloss)

2. Lingerie. IT'S FOR YOURSELF. It'll make you feel feminine and sexy. Get something you feel comfortable and girly in. And if you want to show it off, go get em' girl! 

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> 21F So, I've been thinking about my options for birth control lately since I want to start having sex with my boyfriend. He's all for using a male condom, but I would like to be on sometime of birth control as well to make it safer.
I've looked at all the methods open to me on the planned parenthood site and done my research but now I'm just extremely anxious about what to do. To be honest, everything is scaring me now. 
I would really prefer something that doesn't mess with my hormones or decrease my period. Otherwise, I really liked the idea of Depo Provera or the Patch.
I thought about the sponge, or nuvaRing which really feels the best and most comfortable to me, but I'm just so terrified they'll get stuck up there and I won't know what to do. I mean what are the chances of that? What are other people's thoughts of them?
Another problem is I really don't want my parents to know, or they will kill me. ( I'm Indian- and it just wouldn't be a realm great joy to them if they knew I wanted to have sex.)   so please keep that in mind!

Anyway, a little anxious here and would really appreciate some advice

edit: I've also read that you can use spermicide on it's own (without the diaphragm) with a condom on. Would any one suggest that? </TEXT>

she said I had never written a good soap note (which is impossible -because I've been doing soap notes for two years and all the nurses say they are great and fix nothing.)
i didn't know where to put the 5   6 lead on a pt and asked my instructor and she called me incompetent and dragged me out of the room.
and when i was doing a pt assessment she also dragged me out of the room saying that i needed to let the pt eat his lunch when the pt clearly stated that he'd rather get the assessment over and eat in peace after that. Then my instructor documented that I had incompetent assessment skills. 
These are a couple of the things that went wrong.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 

Hmm, where do I start? I've finally found a place to tell my story and maybe encourage a few other nursing students while I'm at it.
In my 1st semester of Junior year, I was on a cardiac med surge floor. I loved it, at first. Love  reading EKGs, loved giving meds, and making connections to patients and setting up IVs, - I loved all of it. Then, my instructor started to get picky with me. She started to yell at me, ask me "what were you thinking!?", told me I'd never become a nurse, told me I was going to fail no matter what I did. I went in to my labs for extra practice because by this point  I was pretty scared. She sent me for senior year testing, and of course - I failed it because I had just started my junior year. I"m not up to end of year senior status as a nursing student. She called me incompetent and all.
When I confronted her and asked why she was allowing other students to learn  in a non-theatening manner and not myself - she said again, you are incompetent. And don't bother trying to tell anyone this because no one will believe you. I mean come on, who are they going to believe, a clinical instructor or a student who seems to be failing." After that, she failed me for the semester- I developed Panic disorder and depression.
The next semester where I was doing my OB rotation and Psych rotation were a mess. I froze up everytime my clinical instructor came to talk to me or see me do Ivs or exams. I started shaking, hyperventilitating. Things weren't going well. I went on panic disorder and depression medication...I was a mess, like I said. BUT, slowly, things started to get better. My instructor was kind, she understood, my psychiatrist was kind, and I started to believe in my self. Somehow- through some miracle I made it and passed through that semester. I lost a lot, but I gained a lot of strength. I am no longer student president of my class. I am barely hanging in the Honors program of my school, and any internship I could have wanted was out of my reach. BUT, like I said, I gained a lot of strength. Going back into medsurge this year is scary. I think about someone yelling at me everyday, but I know i can do it. Be confident, practice, and most of all, never believe anyone that says you can't be a nurse. You can and you will.

<TEXT> I really enjoyed this article! 
One of the things I had to argue about though is the line: 
"The ultimate goal of all feminists, male or female, is and rightly should be the welfare and social and political emancipation of women."

I wouldn't entirely agree with that. The more updated definition of feminism is the political, economical, and social equality of the sexes. Not just WOMEN. 

Because of the older definition of feminism, my boyfriend will NOT admit he is feminist even though he so clearly is. 

Anyway, good article overall, get's a good look into the male mind (I think.) </TEXT>
