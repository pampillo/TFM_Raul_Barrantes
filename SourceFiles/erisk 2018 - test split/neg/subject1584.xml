<TEXT> [Part 3 Here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/69tnen/i_wish_my_roommate_was_here_part_3/?st=J2H8GE8W sh=ce169111)

I had never been in a fight in my life, which is what made my body surprise me so much. I manage to sidestep my dads charge and place a hand on his back, shoving him into the wall of the building behind me. He manages to turn sideways a bit and save his face, but he still hits the wall with a loud smack. He turns back to face me and I can see the anger in his eyes. I turn towards the alley exit and take off at a full sprint again, hoping to put distance between us. It may seem cowardly to some of you, but my body was running on what felt like autopilot and apparently it thought that was the best option. I had never seen my dad run before so I had no idea how fast he could run. I check over my should and see that hes not too far behind me, gaining only a little at a time. I face forward again and give my body an extra push to run faster.

I dont really know where Im running to until I realize that Ive made it to the front of my dorm. Dorms on-campus have electronic locks that keep anyone who doesnt have a fob out. I begin to feel some hope again, until I reach into my pocket and realize my keys are gone. For the second time that night, I find myself wishing my roommate was there. My heart feels like it drops all the way down to my stomach. I look behind me, expecting my dad to grab me from behind. To my surprise, hes nowhere in sight.

I look around a couple times to be sure, but I never catch even a glimpse of him. At that moment, another guy from the dorm opens the door to leave and I dash in. I hurriedly walk to my room. I should tell someone, I think to myself. But what if you only imagined it, Erich? What if this is all just a really bad dream or something? I make it to my room and am happily surprised to find my door is unlocked. I open it door and step into the dark room, breathing a sigh of relief. I close the door behind me, locking it and switch on the light. As I turn around from the door, my eyes widen in horror and my stomach twists into an inconceivable loop. Standing against the far wall in my room is my dad, staring directly at me. In his hand are my keys.

I immediately fumble for the doorknob unlocking it, but he swoops across the room and grabs me from behind before I manage to open the door. He slams me down on the floor on my back and stands bent over me. Nice try, kiddo, he says with a slight rasp. He backs up to the door, keeping an eye on me the whole time. He reaches behind him and locks the door again.

In the split second that I have before he steps back to me from the door, a million thoughts race through my head. This is just a dream, loops through my head. For some reason, I am convinced it is a dream. All of sudden, an idea pops into my head. In dreams, people can take control, right? They can make the dream turn out how they want to, they just have to realize they have that power. It was at the exact moment my dad reached my body again that I decide, Im taking control of this dream.

I bring my foot up quicker than even I thought I could, slamming it deep into my dads stomach and knocking him backwards. As he staggers, I get back up to my feet. He recovers quickly and charges me again. I sidestep again, keeping my leg out to trip him but he avoids it. He swings at me wildly but I duck and his knuckles slam into my lofted bed frame instead. I drive my fist into the same area I kicked and quickly follow up with a punch to the side of his face. This dream seems to finally be going my way. I continue swinging, a punch here or there getting blocked but many of them hitting their mark. It was hard to tell who was more surprised, him or me. I finally sweep his legs out from under him with a kick and he topples to the floor. Unable to control myself, I kneel down on top of him and begin driving my fists into his face.

He manages to block the first few, but more and more begin to make it through and his face begins to turn bloody under my knuckles. I shout, This is my dream, you fucking dick, over and over again, with a punch in between every word. I dont stop when he stops squirming. I dont stop when he stops blocking. I dont stop when his nose squirts blood on me. I dont stop when I feel his jaw crack. I dont even stop when I feel my knuckles begin to crack from the trauma. In fact, I never stop, not willingly anyways.

My next door neighbors had heard the commotion and reported it to an RA on the floor. Apparently the RA had come in the room and shouted for me to stop as I sat on top of my father beating the shit out of him, but I never heard. The RA then ran to call 911 as people gathered into the hallway, looking into my room. About 5 minutes after he had initially come into the room, the RA came back to see me still swinging and shouting. He tackled me off of my dad and held me tightly as I resisted and continued swinging.

After a couple more minutes, I stopped resisting and shouting. I just feel deathly silent. The police arrived and were clearing everything up as my RA escorted me from the room. I was shaking violently from all that had happened while my RA gave me some water to drink and talked to me about the police needing to speak to me. I spoke to them and explained what happened. They escorted me to the station a few blocks away so I could give them more concrete answers. I told them everything, my childhood, the first time my dad sexually molested me, that it had carried on until my parents separated, the phone call I had with my mom, and all of the incidents of tonight. They were alarmed, asking me why Id never come forward before, but I didnt have an answer for them. One officer was assigned to put me in a holding cell for the night, since my dorm room was a crime scene.

The next morning, I woke up in the cell with an officer sitting directly outside. Whats going to happen? I ask. He tells ,e there will more than likely be a court case and hearing, but then reassured me everything would work out and be fine now. Am I going to have to see my dad? I ask him. His eyes immediately become filled with worry and sadness. Son, your fatherhes dead.

Honestly, the rest of the semester was a blur. I made it back to campus, moved to a different dorm. My old roommate and I still hang out weekly and things are actually going pretty well now. I have a girlfriend, am doing well in all of my classes, and even have an amazing internship opportunity lined up. Everything is going spectacularly. So why do I still feel terrified inside most of the time? 

Constant knots in my stomach, snapping awake in cold sweats, no longer being able to sleep, headaches, paranoia, everything. I couldnt figure it out for the longest time, but since Ive started sharing my story with the rest of you who, like me, can longer fall asleep because of the horrors that lurk in your mind, Ive discovered why Im still so afraid: when I was sitting on top of my dad, pounding his face in repeatedly, shouting at him, I didnt want it to be a dream. Im no longer afraid of the monster my dad was. Now Im afraid of the monster he made me.

<TEXT> [Part 2 Here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/69ga76/i_wish_my_roommate_was_here_part_2/?st=J2F58WVX sh=76333e8f)

With more context from my previous post, maybe you guys now understand why running into my dad was so terrifying to me. I wish I could say he talked to me and made amends and apologized and all that, but that most certainly did not happen (though thats what I told my mom). No, what happened was a lot worse

What are you doing here? I ask, short of breath. Is that any way to greet your father? He chuckles a little. I dont respond. Instead, I look around hoping people are still out and about. A sinking feeling takes over my stomach as I realize the campus has hit a dead period, where everyone is either in class, the library, or dorms. A person here or there crossed my eyeliner, but they were very far off. I look back at him and say, Sorry, I cant right now. Ive got studying and homework. I turn to walk away, but he grabs my arm  harshly and spins me back around. School can wait, he says, all grins and chuckles gone from his disposition. I pull my arm free. I have to work, I say with as much aggression as I can muster into my voice. His face twists slightly in anger. My dad always had an issue with people who refused to acknowledge him and what he wanted. I knew I was lighting a fuse as soon as I told him I wasnt going with him, but for once in my life I didnt care. 

Dont you fucking walk away from me, he said in a harsh whisper. I wish I had the courage to stand up to him, but I freeze. What do you want, Dad? I ask shakily. Ive protected you, kept you safe, done everything I could for you, and this is how you talk to me? He steps forward. I step backwards. Protected me? Protected me from what? I ask, anger flaring up inside of me. The fact that he not only saw nothing wrong with the way he treated me all those years, but that he actually thought he was helping me and being a good parent appalled me. The world, he says. All the shit in the world. I made sure you never once had to deal with any kind of  hardship in your life. You had it easy, he raises his voice. I cant believe what he is saying to me. My anger continues to boil. Easy? Easy?! You fucking raped and beat me! I exclaim. He grabs my arm again. All I ever did was show you I loved you. At this point, my anger gets the best of me. I shrug my arm out hot his grip, rear back, and punch him directly in the jaw.

I smirk a bit and turn around, heading towards my dorm. He cant do anything to me, Im on a college campus, I think to myself. Next thing I know, I hear him grunt with exertion and a crushing pain emanate from the back of my head, as if someone nailed me with a cinder block. Before I even have the opportunity to think I guess he can do something to me here, my world went black.

The next thing I remember, I open my eyes. They take some time to adjust, but I come to realize that Im in a car. Theres a terrible smell, as if every fast food restaurant in the US had stored food in this car and left it sitting out in the sun. At that point, the back of my head surges with pain, and I close my eyes again. Shouldve just fucking came with me, a voice calls out. I look again and discover Im in the back seat, my dads in the driver seat, and were moving. Where are you taking me? I try to sound assertive, but I fail to mask the tremble in my voice. I look out the window to see that were still on-campus, headed towards the main highway. Cut the shit, son. We both know youre not cut out for college. Youre not supposed to be here. Youre better off staying with me and helping me in the shop. I silently undo my seatbelt and reach towards the car door. Its locked, but I silently unlock it. I take a deep breath as the car picks up speed. We were hitting the main highway and I didnt have much time now. Yeah, fuck that, I respond to him. Simultaneously, I rip the door handle and shove the door open, leaping from the car onto the blacktop below.

The next 30 seconds or so are blurry to me. The car hadnt been going that fast, so I managed to jump out with minimal damage. The problem was, the other cars werent all exactly aware I was going to jump out of a moving vehicle in front of them and a chorus of honking horns ensued. Lights were flashing everywhere and I developed an overwhelming deer-in-the-headlights feeling. I ran back in the direction we had been driving from, passing the University sign at the very edge of campus. I never looked back to see what my dad had done, but I knew he wasnt going to just let me go. 

I sprint through the lower half of campus. Since there arent really any dorms or Greek life houses down here, I dont expect run in to anyone. I begin to wonder what I should do. Should I run to the upper part of campus and seek help, or should I continue searching the lower half for quicker help. Just then a thought occurred to me. My roommate worked down here in the football facility as an equipment manager. Its Friday, they should be practicing around this time. A small amount of hope glimmers in my heart.

I run to the building my roommate worked in and bang on the door. No one responded. I looked through the windows to see that all of the lights were off. At that moment I realized my roommate was gone for the weekend with his work. It was game weekend. Shit, I whisper to myself. You really shouldnt have done that, a voice echoes in the alley. Through the steam rising from the vents beside the building, a shadowy figure emerges. As the light hits him, I can see a massive sinister grin on my dads face. Thats okay though, I dont need you at home to have my way with you. Immediately after saying that, he charged at me.

<TEXT> I cannot even begin to explain this past year. Not fully anyways. Coming to college was a surreal experience to me. I mean, with my grades it was never in doubt, I just always felt like time would prevent me from ever getting there. Now I wish it had. 


The most exciting part of coming to college, at least in my head, was moving into the dorm. Co-ed, free Internet, restaurants on campus, with the potential for some of your future best friends to live just a few doors down? Yes, please! I was stoked. The biggest thing though was getting out of my house. My parents had spent the previous 2 years fighting and had finally decided to separate during my senior year. I hated my dad for cheating on my mom, I hated my mom for not leaving my dad sooner. Once my dad left, I thought that was it and that my life could roll on without him in it. Boy, was I wrong.


It all started about a month in to the semester. Classes were going well, I was enjoying my independence, and certainly enjoying the girls on campus (for those of you who dont know, there is a drastic difference between college girls and high school girls). Anyways, my mom called me one day to check up on me. We talked for about an hour and it was nice, until I was just about to hang up. Have you seen your dad at all recently? My mom asked. I attend college over 3 hours away from my hometown, so I was confused. No, should I have? I respond. My mom mentions that she and he had gotten into another argument in which she shouted at him that I wanted nothing to do with him, which was (and is) true. Apparently, he shouted back at her that he would come ask me that himself. Dread began to creep in my chest, that sort of heavy feeling falling over me. They were feelings I had not felt in a while. I dont want to see him, Mom. I try to sound as calm as possible, but a tremble snakes through my voice. I know hun, but I cant control what he does. If he comes up there and tries to get you to talk to him, just tell him you dont want to, my mom says. Yeah, that has worked so well in the past, I say immediately before hanging up with her. It was harsh, I know, but the dread that crept in had settled onto the top of my shoulders, sitting on my chest and weighing me down. It greeted me as if an old friend, which, I guess, is not entirely inaccurate. It was feeling I had never hoped to feel again. The rest of the night I was quiet. My roommate asked me what was wrong, but I simply told him I was just tired. The next day, things got exponentially worse.


I was walking from my first class to my second, when I had a disturbing feeling that someones eyes were following me across campus. I looked around and saw nothing but the hustle and bustle of students moving from building to building. As I re-focused my gaze forward, I saw a shadow dart behind a building. Its just a student getting to class, I mutter to myself. I worried that I was faking myself out, but I took another look at the building only to realize it was the building I was headed to. I shook myself of the worry because the shadow couldve been anyone, even though it moved suspiciously quickly. I walk into the building and make my way to my second lecture of the day.


As the day goes on, the dread lessens only slightly. I cannot shake the feeling that Im being watched. As I leave my final class for the day around 2 pm, I get another strong sense that Im being watched or followed as I walk across campus. I immediately stop and look around, startling classmates walking behind me but I dont care. As my eyes cross the iconic building of Old Main in the center of campus, my eyes latch onto something. There. By the fountain. A large figure, arguably masculine, stands shrouded in shadow by a tree. Hes too far away for me to see his face, but I can tell that hes facing me. I turn around, ducking my head and continue walking towards my dorm at a brisk pace. No, no, no, no, I whisper to myself. It cant be him, I think to myself. Why would it be him? Just because he and Mom got into a fight? My thoughts get cut short as I slam headfirst into someone. Oh, Im so sorry! I exclaim. As I look up though, my apologetic behavior is replaced with sheer terror. Thats okay. Its been a while, I was hoping to run into you anyway, the man smiles, but not a sincere smile. More of a wicked grin. The man I ran into was my dad.

I'll post more later, it's been a tremendously difficult time for me as of late. This story needs to get out there, but to do that I have to condition myself to tell it.

<TEXT> [Part 1 Here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/69ms9y/i_wish_my_roommate_was_here_part_1/?st=J2DM9JCT sh=e828831a)

Most of you are probably asking yourselves, "why the hell is this guy so frightened by his dad?" This is a fair question, one I will have to back up for. My mom was married to a man before she met my dad. They had apparently met in high school and married soon afterwards. They had my 3 older siblings together. My mom separated from him shortly after my older brother was born. I don't know all of the details, but supposedly he was abusive and an alcoholic. Anyways, after spending some time as a single parent, my mom met my dad through a mutual friend. Apparently, they hit it off pretty quickly. Before they got married, I was conceived. They married shortly after they learned of the pregnancy. I guess you could say I kinda drove them together. From what I've heard, there weren't really any issues or warning signs to be seen when they got together. My mom never had any idea what kind of man - or rather, monster - she was marrying.

I don't remember much from my childhood, but later in life my siblings reluctantly filled me in. I was my dad's first kid. I was born out of wedlock, to a woman that I would claim he never even really loved. Naturally, his anger at his situation was taken out on me. Like her first husband, my dad was an angry and violent alcoholic. Fights ensued almost daily at our house. Usually they were just shouting matches, but sometimes they turned physical. Sometimes, when things got really bad between him and my mom, he would hold me (as an infant, under the age of 3) hostage. He would lay down in bed holding me, the barrel of a pistol pressed against my temple. "Come to fucking bed woman, or I swear to God, I will reprint our bedroom before I pump another one in you," was just one of the many colorful phrases he liked to use. There were many incidents, as I have been told, from when I was little. However, to save time and space, I'll share the most distinct, most horrible memory I have of him.

I was 11 years old. I remember very distinctly, it was 3 days after my birthday. I came home from school one day, climbing off the bus. I see my dad's car in the driveway, which I find odd because he was usually at work. My older siblings had all left home (they were 18 or older), and on that particular day, my mom and little sister were at the hospital. My little sister was recovering from a very serious surgery. I walked in and find my dad on the couch, watching TV and drinking what was definitely not his first beer of the day. The floor in front of the couch was littered with crushed cans, the whole room was filled with the stench of beer. Before I could even say, "Hi Dad," he called out, "Get some fucking work clothes on. We have work to do." My dad was a mechanic for almost as long as he could remember. His actual job was as an aircraft painter for a private corporation, but he always did mechanic work on the side in our garage to make extra cash. I go upstairs and set my stuff down. I was used to his anger and, honestly, was usually just happy if he wasn't hitting me or throwing things at me. I change and run back downstairs, heading to the garage. "What took you so long?" He says, hunched under the hood of a car, beer in hand. "Sorry, sir," I reply.

We work silently on the car, him occasionally calling out the name of a tool and me retrieving it for him. It was a simple routine, one we'd repeated countless times from the time I was 8. After a couple hours or so, I attempt to break the silence. "So, did you get off work early today?" I inquire. From under the car, I hear a sort of angry snort. "The fuck did you just say?" He rolls out from under the car and I see his face twisted in an angry grimace. Fear washes over me like a tall wave knocking a swimmer off of their feet. He stands up, towering over me. He steps forwards me and I step backwards. "I..I..I..I just..." my voice breaks as I back into our stack toolbox. "Just what?" He yells. I find myself unable to speak, which appears to anger him even more. He takes the beer can sitting under the hood of the car and chunks it at me, sending a trail of beer flying through the air, nailing me right in the shoulder. I had closed my eyes and shielded my face when I saw him throw, and when I opened them back up I see him moving upon me. He seizes me by each of my arms and pulls me away from the toolbox. "I'll show you to ask fucking questions you have no business asking," he grunts as he walks me to the car.

He puts his hand square in between my shoulder blades and pushes my head and chest down on to the motor of the car forcefully. He uses the same hand to grab the hood and pull it down harshly, though not slamming it down as I had anticipated. With my arms spread out and the hood down on my back, he takes a smaller toolbox and drops it on the spot of the hood directly above me. I cannot even begin to explain how I feel at this point. My chest has tightened, my lungs feel as if they've both been pierced, my head is spinning, and my vocal chords seem to have seized. As much as I want to call out, scream, beg, or cry, I can't. I struggle, attempting to free myself, but the weight of the hood and the toolbox are simply too much for an 11 year old boy. It is at this second that the world itself changed for me. I feel my dad reach around my waist and begin removing my shorts. "You're just like your fucking whore mother so I'm going to treat you like her," he sinisterly whispers to me at the same time as my shorts and underwear are being dropped to my ankles. I hear his belt being removed and his zipper unzip. I feel a single tear push it's way out of my eye ad drip off of my cheek to the motor components underneath me. What came next was, well....

That part of the story is terribly difficult for me to even think about myself, let alone share with others. I'm sorry, I just can't do it. What I can say is that at that very moment, I died inside. And while I wish I could say this was only a single isolated incident, I cannot truthfully make that claim. Each time afterwards, I died a bit more.

<TEXT> I feel as if a group of my friends aren't actually my friends. We live in the same dorm and it feels like they just used me for my room and some of my stuff and that, once I outlived their purpose, they disregarded me. It's been about a month since they've asked me to hang out with them, yet they hang out together as a group. Anytime I ask to hang out, they usually will individually say they are busy, but I often know they're hanging out because, like I said, we live in the same dorm. None of them seem to even acknowledge my existence any more, unless we happen to bump into each other. It's a terrible feeling, one I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.  </TEXT>
