<TEXT> On break for a couple weeks and decided to watch the X-Men movies again starting with First Class, was prepared to skip through most of X3 because though I enjoyed it when ti came out (I was 9 I think) I knew its reputation hadn't aged well at all. But honestly after 1 and 2 I'm struggling to see what's so awful (shitty young Patrick Stewart CGI notwithstanding). Professor X's death was really emotional and well done imo, and the action and cinematography is top notch. It's definitely cheesy with the whole Iceman/Pyro faceoff sort of stuff throughout the movie, but everything else about it seems like it makes up a perfectly good conclusion to the original trilogy to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The opinion seems to be that he made a stupid mistake in November when he, like everyone else, probably thought Clinton would win and decided to release the letter to save his ass in case it came out he 'concealed' or whatever. But nevertheless it was known he was making efforts to investigate Trump and that Trump didn't like that. So this is no reason for Dems to be happy, unless you count the fact that it'll probably speed up the impeachment hearings tenfold. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is anyone else disappointed that the final episode portrayed Hannah at her most frustrating and insufferable, even if the idea was that she's be redeemed in the end? (just need to vent somewhere) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-18 02:09:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I love this show, and liked that the finale was different and understated. I really hoped I'd finish the series with a better opinion of Hannah and feeling like her good qualities would ultimately outweigh the flaws, but the flaws were pushed so far this episode that I finished the series just feeling angry at her and yet again frustrated that she can't see how awful she is, and that's disappointing.

I know that the point was to show that Hannah still has a lot of maturing to do, and the final scene to show that she's on her way to that, but how many times has this arc played out? Not on the scale of maturing into being a responsible mother, but generally maturing, realising that her problems aren't the end of the world. i.e. Becoming friendly with Mimi-Rose in the end after resenting her so much, or realising how narcissistic she really is and what she really wants in life after the two day escape with Joshua. After all these arcs play out she seems to never ultimately change in any meaningful way. I feel like the Hannah we saw tonight could have been the Hannah from season 1. If she'd gotten pregnant in episode 5 and this had been the first episode of Season 2, I don't think anyone would complain that her character has suddenly dramatically changed for no reason.

I don't think I've ever been more angry at Hannah before than when she was acting horrible to Marnie and her mother. Marnie was annoying as hell with the singing and condescending advice at times, but Hannah was acting more like a child than we've seen in a long time, and she should be willing to put up with Marnie's worst quirks considering she's basically provided her child with a second mother. Hannah telling Marnie "You're suck at this, you're doing a bad job" made me so genuinely annoyed and I hoped Marnie would push back more. Marnie's done incredibly self serving and selfish things in the past seasons but deciding to help raise Grover is not one of them, so it didn't feel good at all to see her be told off by an incredibly ungrateful Hannah here. When the three of them were sitting on the porch at the end, I felt like the idea was that the viewer would feel good that they're together again, and putting their spats behind them, but all I wanted was for Loreen and Marnie to tell Hannah off for her behaviour and how hurtful she was to the two of them. She shouldn't have been able to just sit there between them as if she didn't say those things, and letting her get away with it without any consequences will only perpetuate those sorts of hurtful outbursts in future. How many times is this show going to have the whole conversation of Hannah's false victim complex ultimately losing out to her good side, only to be reset again?

**Hannah**: I'm in pain! My life is so hard, can't you see?

**Other person (Adam, Noreen, Shosh)**: You're not the only one with problems, get out of your own head and into the real world where everyone's suffering!

How many times is a conversation like this going to play out only for Hannah to seemingly get worse a few episodes down the line?
Ultimately, the finale left me feeling like Hannah is at her core a selfish, nearly irredeemably narcissistic person who has shown good qualities coming through that personality at certain times throughout the series in spite of that, and not a good person who's shown narcissistic and unlikable qualities at certain times throughout the series, as I hoped she'd be. But I also know that I could be being unreasonable and missing the point, and maybe no one else left with this feeling, and that's ok too. I'll miss the show either way. </TEXT>

I just can't find a straight answer as to whether I need to buy an audio interface to put in between it or if it can work directly in from the keyboard. At the MIDI end of the lead  there's a split with one midi (male) marked MIDI IN and another marked MIDI OUT. Do I just plug the OUT one into the midi out socket on my keyboard? Or both in to the in and out?

<TEXT> I see what you're saying, but I don't understand how it's more accurate on a practical level to say it's in D minor if the scale of D minor, or that of its relative major F, won't work at all over the song. After hearing just one round of the progression, the D minor (if we're thinking in that key, I know the original is in a different key) always sounds like 2 to my ears, and never like 1, so I think that's enough reason to say it's A minor. 

But this is all open to interpretation I guess. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you! I should have thought of the running the F minor scale thing on the spot, could have clarified his stance a bit more. Like it seems crazy to me to label that song as F minor, because if someone's busking it, they'll think it's going 65 (if you're calling the chords as in the relative major Ab) rather than 21 for the verse and that's just disastrous. That's great feedback, thanks, I'm a bit confused now though since I just got another good answer claiming the bass player was totally right on /r/musictheory, but appreciate all the info nonetheless. music theory bein weird </TEXT>

Just thinking in terms of what would be most easily digestible for a musician seeing it at a gig for example. And if you were writing out the parts, would you place the key signature as F minor even though there would inevitably be more accidentals? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Today I was talking about a song with a band I'm playing with in college, and the song starts on Chord 2 (i.e. if we're in the key of Eb, it starts on F minor). [This is the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y6Nne8RvaA), the progression for the verses and choruses is mostly just 212121 etc. The bass player asked what key it was, and the guitarist told him it was F minor. I assumed he said that because it's the first chord and you'd instinctually think that'd be the key without putting much thought into it, but I mentioned that it was actually Eb or its relative C minor, since it starts on Chord 2 which isn't the root. I only corrected it because obviously F minor and C minor don't share the exact same notes so there'd inevitably be some weirdness going on if one or two of us were thinking in F minor and others in C minor. The bass player told me I was incorrect, and that the key isn't Eb or C minor, that I shouldn't base what I refer to as the key on what the key signature would be on paper. He said the 'key center' for most of the song was the F minor, so the key is F minor or 'F dorian'. Honestly I had never heard about this way of labeling (idk the proper word) a key before, I'm only in second year of my degree and gigging on a professional level for a few months, but this guy has had way more experience MDing in the past and knows his stuff so I didn't tell him he was wrong. Just wondered what others think, I could be very wrong but I just want to know.


Another example of a similar song whose key I thought was labelled incorrectly really often is Get Lucky. The progression is just 2465 i.e. DmFAmG if we're in C major. I would have said the key is C or A minor and it just starts on Dorian/2, but whenever I'd see the key next to the song name on a setlist it'd always just be down as the first chord in the song i.e. Dm and I'd feel the need to correct it.


**TL;DR**: if a song starts on and seems based around a chord that isn't the root or its relative minor, do you still call the root note the key, or do you go by the most frequent chord/'key centre'?

Id take a leap of faith, but Id lose my nerve. In the end, Ill get the hell that I deserve.

Im always gone with the wind, crawling in and out of my mind. God knows, I've lost all my faith.

Hope is a prison.

Of all the patterns that I could create, I built a labyrinth with no escape, to keep my self under lock and key. I am my own worst enemy.

But yeah, it wouldn't fully capture the magic of playing through the games. Would be awesome nonetheless. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [MGSV Spoilers] If having the game be linear like MGS4 and not open world meant more cutscenes and focus on story, do you think it would ultimately be better for it? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-01 08:59:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just been thinking about this since I finished it the other day (I was very late to the party, but wanted to wait until I had time to completely sink into the game). The gameplay was the best I've maybe ever played, all the complex systems were woven together amazingly, and the open world was a large part of it, but I think I would let that suffer if it meant more cutscenes and tighter story telling. 

Another idea could have been to just release Chapter 1: Revenge, and then a year or two later release a fully completed Chapter 2 (or 3, if there was ever an intention to make one, which evidence suggests there was).

(I'll just say my random thoughts on the game as a whole here in case anyone cares to read them as I have no one to discuss it with right now, ignore if you want). 

Overall it was a perfect **gaming** experience, and I truly think that in terms of pure gameplay (i.e. every part of MGS that isn't story), Kojima achieved everything he set out to when he made those claims early in development that this would be his masterpiece and the pinnacle of his career. I (like most it seems) felt differently about the story. I went in determined to finish the game adoring the story as much as I did that of 1, 3 and 4, and not agreeing with any of the criticisms I'd heard, but I just didn't feel that way when the final credits rolled (partially because I didn't even know if they were the final credits, and only realised when no Chapter 51 popped up). It had a few incredibly poignant and powerful moments, but it was overall sparse and disappointing in my opinion. It was bizarre, but not in a good MGS-bizarre way. Not Otacon peeing his pants in MGS1 bizarre, not Volgin's kink for General Raiden in MGS3, more just bizarre in that it kept trying to push Skull Face as something beyond a painfully shallow and cliche villain for an MGS game, whose big master weapon felt like a joke with no real weight to it. The parasites didn't feel any more threatening after listening to Code Talker ramble on the cassette tapes for two hours or so. It was heartbreaking to see how much the game fell apart after the end of Chapter 1. Seeing that of the 19 or so new missions that would come, only 6 were actually new kind of sucked. The recycled early missions with extra difficulty should be an extra option for those seeking an extra challenge, and not numbered chapters in the main story. I wish only the 6 new missions would have been left in, even if it left the game feeling shorter. Also, the way arguably the most important story mission (Escape the Hospital again) just sort of pops up without any fan fair felt weird, and the fact that when it's over there's nothing telling you that the game is definitely over felt weird too. I played for hours after beating the remaining recycled missions waiting for something more, some resolution to Eli's escape, some news on the real Big Boss, anything. 

For what it's worth though, I did like the twist after thinking about it, it was really the most powerful way to convey the message of Big Boss as a symbol and a meme, rather than a man. It's hinted at early on in Ocelot's conversations about how the story of Mother Base's destruction had gotten blown out of proportion, BB dying a martyr for a cause etc. The Phantom twist illustrated that point beautifully, and though it sucks to know that the whole time I wasn't playing as the Snake from MGS3 and Peace Walker, and just some random medic who had some hypnosis and some stunningly good plastic surgery for the early 70s (not to mention a luckily similar voice to BB), I feel like without it the story really would just have zero redeeming features. 

Some other random points;

- Ocelot doing literally nothing interesting other than the horse chase at the start was so disappointing. We didn't see him in action once, and that's one of the things I was looking forward to most. I wanted to see him kick ass on the field, not just bicker with Kaz back at base and show off his extensive knowledge of the plants of Afghanistan. 

- A deeper backstory on the "Medic" would have been nice and added a lot. Thought I like the twist, it's uncomfortable to know that the guy I've been playing as was probably some random that I fultoned during Peace Walker who just happened to be on the chopper with Paz and BB. In the cassette tape after the twist drops, BB asks the Phantom, "Do you remember now, who you really are? Your past?" I found it bizarre that this wasn't a cue for some backstory, but maybe that's asking for too much. It felt a bit like Darth Vader turning out to be Luke's uncle and not his father.  

- I think there should have been more about what the real BB had been up to since waking up, rather than a sentence or two alluding to him conducting a covert war on Cipher. How can they say that and then just leave us hanging? Of course we're going to want to know every detail about what he's been up to. 

- I know it's probably a bit immature to want it, but considering Liquid's presence in the game, seeing Solid Snake/ David would have added so much to the story for me. I know he got a mention in a couple of cassette tapes, but it's not the same, and I'm sure he could've been tied in somehow. Kojima's definitely no stranger to fan service so I don't know why he got no screen time. 

- There was so much buzz about Kojima wanting to explore taboo themes in this, and Ground Zeroes accomplished this with the child torture, the brutal stomach bomb removal from Paz, etc. Having played TPP, it feels very run of the mill and not as if it's breaking any new ground. It did in parts with the child soldiers, but there were scenes involving them in the trailers that weren't in the final game so I can only imagine many of those plot elements were cut (which would also help explain Chapter 2: Race barely exploring Race at all.)

- I really loved Kiefer as BB/ Venom Snake, if they were just looking for a less cartoonish David Hayter, they found the perfect guy. He sounded subdued and defeated but also strong with hints of the Snake we know. I didn't mind at all that Snake didn't talk much. I just think it was a missed opportunity to add to the big twist (obviously BB in Ground Zeroes being voiced by Kiefer nullifies this). Having Kiefer voice Venom the whole game, and then when the real BB is shown talking to Ocelot outside the hospital in the end, it's David Hayter. This could have maybe worked if he'd muffled his voice at the start, or the player's hearing was damaged so could only barely making out Ishmael's voice, etc. But I don't know, that's probably just me being too desperate to squeeze Hayter in somewhere.

- Huey was just bizarre in this game and had no character arc. The first thing we hear about him is "Huey popped up here, we think he was involved in the incident 9 years ago but he'll say he's not.". And that's Huey's entire storyline. And his cries of shame as Snake was forced to kill his men in the Quarantine lab were just irritating since it would've been blatantly obvious that Snake was doing it to save many more. Having Huey do that felt like a cheap and unnecessary way to make the player feel conflicted about BB's actions, when I already felt the emotional weight of it before it was dragged down a bit by Huey's cries. 

- Another couple of immature fan servicey things, but confirmation on The Third Boy being Psycho Mantis would've been nice (I know it's probably definite but I mean 100% confirmation), and Quiet turning out to be young Sniper Wolf would have been cool too.  </TEXT>

Is it until I can literally play it for minutes without stopping or making any mistakes at all? Or just very comfortable with it, still prone to the odd mistake here and there, but not quite having spent a ridiculous amount of time? I'd always thought it was the first one (get it perfect), but it's taking so much time. I'm still on the first exercise.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Excellent answer, thank you. I'll gladly use the sound guy's DI whenever they have one, but for certain gigs we have to do our own sound with our own PA so it'd just be for those situations. Not seeing a lot of options for Dual boxes online - the keyboard I'm using is a relatively new (last 5-10 years) Kawai MP4 Stage Piano, would you think a passive DI box would be alright? I wouldn't want to overload an active box. </TEXT>

I want to get one because it'll mean I can reliably go to the PA (with the box) without worrying about bringing a massive amp, but I still don't really know exactly what it does.

edit: One more thing; are certain DI boxes better for certain instruments, or would a good DI box be universally good for bass, keyboard etc.? </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I can usually run about 6k, but I find one day I can just make it to 3k but at the end still feel as (if not more) exhausted than if I had run 6k on a normal day, will I still only burn half the calories despite feeling like I've exerted myself just as much? Is the amount of calories burned more tied to pure distance or is it more the physical exertion itself? (also I know the distances aren't super impressive, just getting back into running after being out of it for about a year!) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, I didn't care at all for the whole Elektra/return of Stick/The Hand element of Season 2. It was just boring to me, and I didn't feel interested at any point, really. It was so detached from the Punisher plotline, which is what I expected to be front and centre the entire season. I was really disappointed that the last few episodes focused far more on the Hand stuff than the Punisher stuff. To me it felt like The Punisher was only really the complete focus in episodes 1-4. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm watching from the start (I'm very late to the party), and just finished Episode 3, The Locked Room, and that part where Hart learns of a key connection that might be a huge breakthrough on the Lange case, and the two are in the car and Hart's like "I gotta say, you were spot on on this one", and Cohle is like "Fuck yeah, Martin.", I honestly squealed with joy. And it's mostly because of all the tension and mistrust between them thus far, they hadn't had much of that. 

I don't know, just a random thought I thought I'd share because I usually never feel super pumped when two characters have sort of "bro-ish" moments because it might be in their nature anyway, but with these two you know they must be seriously happy with each other in this moment due to the previous tensions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get your point totally and there are tonnes of these sort of "technically impressive" scenes that I'd say that about, but honestly I feel that it adds to the quality of the film in this case, especially in the context of the rest of the film. There was very minimal dialogue previously, and nearly everything was told through angles, imagery, actions etc. Then we have this very long, dialogue heavy scene, and while the element that was previously basically absent (dialogue) comes in full force, the elements that were previously completely amped up come down to the bare minimum; a completely bare room, very basic wardrobe, and **one angle and take**. On top of that I sort of feel like it adds to the intensity of the scene, I think it'd feel weirdly 'safer' if there were traditional cuts as the scene went along. The single take keeps it on edge always. </TEXT>

The fact that there's a more impressive version of it in a different medium doesn't discount the power of this scene or the merit of it and the work the actors put in.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't say that the British authorities should have granted the demands. I was just uncertain and looking for clarity in the first comment I posted asking which group were being referred to. I learned about these times in history classes but I'm not going to pretend to know enough about this particular time and issue to write a big answer on it, or to have a very informed opinion, but I do know that the struggle for a United Ireland was something that'd been ongoing for long before these people, in a just way (Michael Collins, Anglo-Irish treaty), so please don't compare that to the RAF. But like I said, I don't really know too much in depth about the 70s and 80s and the struggles of the PIRA and IRA and Sands. The IRA were by and large not a good group of people and did a lot of horrific things, but it is different.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Completely different cases and it isn't that black and white, but I get your point. The film wasn't made to be an IRA propaganda piece, just a means to tell a story about this man who chose to suffer greatly for something he thought was greater. I think that the director would have chosen to make the film even if this person had been suffering for a different cause or organisation, McQueen isn't an IRA sympathiser as far as I know. The film is so focused on the character of Sands, and not the organisation as a whole, that there isn't even much room to "downplay what scum they were" anyway. It just shows what happened within the walls of the prison.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hate that it happened, but only because it hurt to watch. It was incredibly done, imo. The lighting, though not subtle at all, gave depth to the idea that this was the decisive moment in Kylo's complete fall to the Dark Side. I also loved the lack of music; there was pretty much no music going on during the scene, which made it completely tense. It was done beautifully imo and it was tragic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the main goal of this film was to introduce a new generation of characters, a new story, while also embracing the original trilogy's characters and themes. I think if they had put in too many characters from the original trilogy, there wouldn't have been that balance; it would have felt too much like part of the original trilogy, when it's the first in a new trilogy. I mean, Luke wasn't really even in TFA, and Leia only very briefly, and it definitely felt to me like the OT was given enough attention in this movie; I think if they'd put Lando in there it just would've been too much. I'm hopeful that Lando will have a part in future though! He's probably the biggest heroic character in the OT besides the main three anyway so I'd say it's probably inevitable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My drum teacher has been trying to drill into me that back fulcrum is the only proper technique, and if you watch videos of most pro drummers who hit at least moderately hard, they're using it. I think it mostly makes it easier to play generally in that it requires less energy if you have your back three fingers supporting the stick, and it makes finger control a lot easier. Honestly I don't see anything wrong with first finger and thumb and I've done it for years, but even already playing has gotten easier using back fulcrum. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Make sure your technique is solid from the start, or else you'll find out years later that you have to put in ridiculous amounts of work to fix it. The main thing is that you're gripping the stick right, not between your index and thumb, but mostly with your back three fingers. 

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm the exact same whenever I go on a five piece. Like, I'll go to try out a fill I like, and I'll completely freeze up - it's like my brain thinks there are two many options (though there's really only one more than usual) and doesn't know what to do. 

It'd be worth sticking with it for a while though, you might grow into it. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-11-14 22:40:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I hear a lot of drummers who are at an incredibly high standard of playing kind of slagging off rebound - well not a lot, but my drum teacher and a few others I've known. I've always used rebound and find it hard to use just fingers or some other technique. I can't tell sometimes what technique some are using either so it's hard to know where to go from here. Like when Tony Royster Jr. does his fast strokes [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytEMYipwrDw) it looks like fingers, but honestly I don't really know.

I don't know, the whole perfect technique vs. good sound despite bad technique argument is never going to end. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Not just jamming and playing, but working on specific things

This is vital, I spent so long doing a lot of what I thought of as practice, when really I'd maybe learn one specific thing and then noodle around with stuff I already have down perfectly for ages, or just jam along to songs. There's also the danger of "comfort playing" when you're trying to learn something that's really challenging. Just falling back on something you put time into learning before, so you can restore some confidence in your ability.

<TEXT> I've been learning a fair bit about how long different people practice since starting music college in September. Honestly, you have to do so much to get to a professional level. My drum teacher practiced seven hours a day when he was a student, and he still expresses regret at not having practiced more. My harmony lecturer practiced 10 hours a day, and I know he's not exaggerating because I've heard a lot of people say he's one of the best in Europe. 

Sorry to drag that point on so long - but basically, it depends on your goals. If you just want to get better while keeping it a hobby, so you can be able to player harder things, an hour or two a day would be great. But if you're looking for a career in the future, I'd say at least four a day, honestly.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Just a quick question, not sure where else to ask: How would you, as a regular music listener, define "music technology"?

<DATE> 2015-10-07 07:00:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Asking because I have to write an essay for college. The title is "Discuss Some of the Ways that Technology has Influenced the Development of Popular Music."

One of the points I'm making is about the common instinctual idea of what "music technology" would be - that is, things like computer software, microphones etc. My point is that it really could refer to any means of creating music that has been created by humanity and not been something completely natural like the voice, the body, a stick lying on the ground as a percussion instrument etc. This would segway into a paragraph on some of the earliest instruments which I personally find would be interesting to read about. My lecturer kept hammering home two points about this essay; make it stand out from other people's; do everything you can to hold the reader's interest throughout the essay; and to interpret the title in whatever way we want, as long as what we talk about is accurate, and that it is well written and interesting. So, taking this advice, I was going to focus on the other, more common perception of the term "music technology", and talk about something of more personal interest to me; The Dark Side of the Moon. 

I like the idea of such contrast between those paragraphs, if it's done well, but my fear is that the whole first paragraph about the earliest music technology would just be considered gibberish and completely wrong. I'm getting paranoid that my thinking of "music technology" as any manmade means of creating or producing music is just plain wrong, and my lecturer would just see it as nonsense. 

What do you think? (apologies for rambliness)

<TEXT> I've been playing for seven years, and just started college studying a Popular Music course, specializing in drums! One of the first things that my college drum tutor told me was that I sit too close to the snare, and that it's causing unnecessary tension to sit that way because it results in me having to hold my elbows back, and put strain on my arms and muscles around that area. I would usually have sat with the front of my knees being about five or six inches ahead of the edge of the snare closest to my core, whereas my drum teacher tells me the most comfortable and economic way would be to sit with your knees about two inches ahead of the edge tops.

I'm working on fixing it now, but I have no idea how common this mistake is. I would think it'd be common enough for drummers who spend years without formal, personal instruction, because one would have a natural tendency to sit closer in order to be able to hit the rack tom(s) more comfortably. 

How close would you say you sit? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've just started first year in music college and we're told we have to practice the songs we have to perform in ensemble class with a click at least half the times we'd generally play them in practice. It's not too bad when the click is just in my headphones and everyone's going on my time, but when it's over the PA and everyone can hear it, it's a lot harder because the whole band is very tense and focusing so hard on the sound of the click that they're more likely to go out of time.

The only advice would really be to practice with it just in your ears on your own until you can hold the tempo with the click fairly comfortably, then you'll be better set to do it with the full band. Also just whenever there's a fast, longish fill or buildup, try and intentionally play slower than your instinct tells you, because a lot of drummers would speed up quite a bit during parts like that, so I guess compensate for it by slowing down. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this is a more subtle example of his amazing foot technique and control. He accents the bass drum on the downbeat very heavily straight after he's just played a very soft hit at the end of the groove, and then goes back to the soft hits. He gets the same volume level every time too. That's not easy. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Just a quick question, not sure where else to ask - would a "Motown song" be any song that was released on the actual label Motown, or a song that would fall into a specific genre called Motown, with a specific sound and style? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-15 23:02:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Asking because my college band has to choose a Motown song for our performance class and we're not sure what the parameters are. I really want to do either Superstition by Stevie Wonder, because it's known, really fun to play, and grooves insanely well, or Rock With You by Michael Jackson, pretty much for the same reasons. The problem is that I'd consider Superstition to be a pretty classic funk tune, and wouldn't musically speaking associate it with the likes of  'Ain't No Mountain' or 'Baby Love', pretty famous Motown classics. However, it was released on the Motown label. With Rock With You, it's pretty much a pop/R B song in my eyes, but early Michael Jackson is generally associated with Motown. This wasn't released on the label but I'd associate it with the label, and honestly I really really want to do it. 

So basically I'm wondering if, when people refer to something as a "Motown Song", it can be any song released on that label. Another one we were going to do was War by Edwin Starr, which is a Motown song released on the Motown label, so it'd work, but we'd prefer the other two! </TEXT>

<TITLE> This is kind of urgent - how do I approach someone close, in this case my brother, about whether he's going through a worse time than everyone thought, and thinking of suicide? We don't talk much despite living together and I have no idea what to do right now. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-12 03:58:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's half past 2 in the morning, and earlier in the night I was looking for a special type of battery for a weighing scales, on the offchance there was something around the house that would have one. I was looking around my room (I share a bedroom with my brother, he's 21 and I'm 18 and we live at home), and checking everywhere. I know I shouldn't have looked in the first place, but my brother's sock drawer, which he also puts little random things of interest to him in out of convenience, was open and I saw a suicide prevention helpine card in it. It had four different numbers and it said it was open 24/7. When I found it my eyes just widened and I felt really tight in my chest and just didn't know what to do. I tried telling myself it was a coincidence, and I'm guessing a anyone reading this will think I'm over reacting and he probably just got it handed out to him in school a long time ago and left it there, and maybe that is the case, but I'm extremely worried right now. Like, more than I have been in a long, long time. No one has to read it, honestly I don't expect anybody to and I'd appreciate any advice even if you just read up to here, but I guess to explain why I'm so, incredibly worried over a seemingly small thing, I'll give a bit of backstory. 

I'm worried because I've known for a while my brother is probably depressed - my dad passed away very suddenly in January 2012 and everyone close to me suffered. I almost left school because I'd missed so much due to depression and anxiety many times, and my brother just kind of stopped going because he couldn't face it. He failed his final exams and didn't get into college, and spent the next year being very depressed and doing pretty much nothing. I should have approached him at this time or before it because it was still in its early stages compared to now, but at the time I was severely depressed myself and couldn't even think about consoling others or offering advice on how to get out of something I was neck deep in. He started a course in a low level college last September, and it went great for a while but eventually the same thing happened as when he was in school; he just couldn't face it. He fell behind on one assignment and that was it. He just stopped going in. The point of that year long course was for it to be another route to get his dream course in a well respected music school here in Cork, but he failed the course and didn't get that. I did get into the course in the music school in question that he wanted - we both have always wanted to go there - through my final exams in school, which I struggled through because I was dealing with extreme depression throughout my final year, and also dealing with the discovery that I'd been living with undiagnosed bipolar for years beforehand. I think the fact that I got the course, along with the fact that I struggled through my attempts to do what I needed to get it, like Emmet did, would be something that would bring him down a lot. I started last Monday and it's obvious how happy I've been. Like, this has been one of the best weeks of my life and I have been so, so happy with college and everything to do with it, and conversely, Emmet's been sitting at home almost 24/7, going to bed very late, watching TV or playing PS3 all day, and not looking for a job. Not to sound arrogant, but it has to be killing him to see his younger brother loving the course that he's wanted to get for so long, and failed to get twice. 

I'm sorry about rambling, I'm just so worried. We barely ever talk but I care about him. He's my brother, and no amount of tension or estrangement can change that fact. There will always be caring between us. My family would be utterly broken and unable to move on if anything happened - there have been very few times since my dad died we've been able to call ourselves a happy or functional family, and another loss would ruin my mom and younger sister. And honestly, the guilt of not talking to him would kill me. Like the main reason I haven't talked to him, besides dealing with my own struggles and not feeling in a good position to do it, is that we don't talk much and aren't close anymore. Whenever we do talk it's awkward and in passing. I think he thinks I hate him, and I often think he hates me. He's also just an angry and frustrated person, and reacts harshly to things, particularly my little sister sometimes, so honestly I do resent him for that a lot of the time and it would add to why we don't speak much. He just never seems like an emotional person in the slightest, just a normal "lad" who doesn't think of life on a deep level at all, and I guess I took that as a sign that he didn't have deeply dark thoughts. It was probably ignorant to think that. Since our dad died our relationship has been non existent despite living together and even sharing a bedroom, so you can imagine how hard it'd be to just have our first actual genuine conversation in a long time be about whether or not he's considering ending his life. I know the obvious answer is probably "even if it's small, just do it anyway, the worst that can happen is a bit of awkwardness", but honestly it'd be so uncomfortable if it turns out to be nothing. Even if it is what I fear, and he is having such dark thoughts, I don't think he'd admit it. The few times I have approached the subject of how he's feeling in the past (never directly, but generally things around that area), he's said "I'm really not in a mood, we'll talk about it later". We never talk about it later. 

I've written a list of people I could call tomorrow (close family mostly), and messaged a couple of close friends to see if they're up just if they have any advice. There's no way I'm talking to my mom about this, she would get so stressed and worried and feel guilty herself and I don't want to put her through that. 

Again, I'm sorry to have gotten so rambly. I don't know what to do. How do I approach him?

Thank you. </TEXT>

I don't think it's fair to say that it isn't accurate to "real life drumming" based on that - I think that's more of a technical mess up. Everyone saying it's not accurate to drumming made me think that the techniques being played (by the overdub or not) and the general sound of the drums were not jazzy or "good" in the eyes of drummers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was the kind of thing - for me - that took a pretty long time to get, but once I did, it sort of clicked and everything fell into place and it was really satisfying and stuff. So basically I said that to say don't get discouraged because I did lots. 

What I did was I played a basic beat for two bars, then two bars of just R-L-K followed by an empty beat, followed by R-L-K. Then the next two bars would be R-L-K, R-L-K etc., 8 times in total. I started very very slow, and when I could play that whole thing perfectly (I think) 8 times, I bumped it up 5 bpm. After a while it just clicked and now it's pretty much easy to get it down at any (rational) tempo. Good luck!

edit; just remembered, one great beat for incorporating this early on in learning it is [Dave Grohl's post chorus groove from Teen Spirit](https://youtu.be/KoQC3gGwqro?t=100). It's just one quick burst of it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 18 and start college next week (I'm so excited :D) to study drums for four years. I'm nervous because many of the students and teachers adore jazz and it will be a big part of the course; but I could never stick to it. I always felt a little bad about that, because my drum teacher I had for five years is a pretty prominent jazz drummer here in Ireland, and lives and breathes it; he did his college thesis on Max Roach for god's sake, so the fact I couldn't get into it made me feel awful. 

That's not the only reason I want to get better, of course, but it has been on my mind. I recently just have an urge to finally put my head down and stay dedicated, but honestly rock and general heavier styles are so ingrained in me that I don't know if I could even get moderately proficient at it any time in the next year or so. Whenever I try to play **trad grip**, I just.... can't. It just doesn't work. I don't know why. I'm the same with **finger technique**. I've tried all the drumeo exercises, everything, but my hand still insists on playing the fast, swung ride patters with the wrist, and it sounds awful and robotic. It's the same whenever I do any shuffle (particularly something like the Purdie shuffle. I know it's not really jazz but it's the finger technique). It's honestly infuriating and makes me feel like I have no soul as a player (that sounds very dramatic but I mean more feel and stuff), and that I'm just a brainless rock guy. I want to learn and I want to be able to do these things naturally. Whenever I see one of my drummer friends post a video of them playing even the simplest jazz pattern, and their wrist is working so beautifully and naturally with their fingers to produce that clean, satisfying swung ride pattern, I honestly feel terrible because I can't do it, despite my best efforts. 

Sorry to get so rambly. Basically, I just want to know if, based on what I've said there, I should dedicated my time to learning all these things. I most definitely want to learn, and want to get good at jazz drumming, but at the same time it could take a very, very long time; time that could be used to further my current strengths and become my own player in that realm. 

**TL;DR:**

**I'm currently at a very basic level of jazz drumming, but I really, really want to get better. Should I dedicate myself to learning jazz (and potentially spend a huge chunk of practice time in the coming months or years doing so) at the possible expense of furthering my current strengths?**

**Finger technique and traditional grip still, after trying quite a lot, feel very unnatural and as if I'll just never be able to do it because using matched grip and just my wrists is so heavily ingrained in my brain. How can I finally learn? Can I learn, will it actually work after all this time?** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the message to Aidan I typed out; 

"Hey look, I haven't wanted to say this because it'll inevitably cause awkwardness or maybe tension or something, and also because I wouldn't put it past myself to be imagining things and dramatizing everything (as usual), but is everything alright? Like, with us? With the band? With me being a part of the band, or being a friend of yours and Lucas's in general? Like I don't want to sound confrontational but seriously it's tearing me up and I can't stop thinking about it. I just feel like you and Lucas have some huge problem with me and aren't saying it. Forgive me if I'm just being dramatic and imagining things, but I'm definitely not imagining the fact that things are way different between all of us now than before, or how I'd hoped they'd be at this stage. I know Lucas probably has a huge problem with me based on how he's treated me in the last few months (the exact same way [*two other friends who basically dropped us all this time last year*] treated us that Lucas loved to complain about), but I thought you and I were ok, and I don't know lately. I can't tell. I keep flipping between thinking that Lucas is constantly complaining about me to you when ye hang out and that I need to grow up and get over it because it's probably nothing. But honestly, it's all I think about when I hear that you and him are hanging out and didn't think to invite me or anything, and that's not me saying "how could you not include me in everything omg??", it's just that we did say we'd do lots of stuff over summer, and you told me that you consider Lucas and I to be your best friends, and seeing you two hang out after practice and generally so much kind of hurts. I know the obvious thing to say to that is to ask why I haven't invited ye to do things with me, but I've spoken to Lucas about this so much - I can't invite people to do things. I know it's childish and pathetic and I need to get over it but I just can't. I become an anxious wreck when I do because I instantly feel that I'll be wasting the person's time. I just have to know. I'm not angry at you, I'm just confused and need to know. That's why I'm hard to be around at practice sometimes, I can just tell that Lucas is in a constant state of being annoyed by my presence and I can't help but feel bitter towards him for how he's let me down lately. I know you won't agree with that because Lucas is your best friend and everything, but I'm just saying what I think is the case. I know that you and Lucas probably see me as overly sensitive anyway, and this is just adding to that, but you have to understand that I have so much time alone with myself that my mind does nothing but think about things like this, and I need to just put a stop to it. Please understand. If it's nothing I'll forget about it and move on." </TEXT>

<TEXT> (Apologies in advance for the long post, I think it's all necessary though for the advice I need. I won't use real names.)

This has been going on for the past 6 months or so. I'll try not to bore you with all the details (see the TLDR if it's too much), but basically my best friend of six years (let's call him Lucas) has, in recent months, stopped talking to me and inviting me to do things. There are a lot of potential reasons for this, but I think it's mainly because he's got a pretty good social life now, when before he had little to none, and that he thinks I have feelings for his girlfriend. I didn't have any social life either, and that's why we got close; we were both socially isolated in different secondary (high) schools, but we were socially isolated together. Last December Lucas started going out with this girl who I was really, really crazy about. I'm pretty sure I was in love with her (because I'm an idiot and fall for people way before I truly know them on any deep level (I'm working on it)), but she rejected me when I told her I liked her. I didn't tell her I was in love with her or anything, just told her after we'd been talking non stop for a couple of weeks that I like her and that maybe it'd be cool to hang out more. Long story short, she really liked Lucas all along, despite the fact that she denied it, and asked him out the day after my 18th birthday. Lucas didn't even like her that way at the time, she just liked him and decided to go for it. The day after my 18th, probably the first time I'd felt real happiness in months, of all days. They've been in a relationship since. He has a good social life now because he's started hanging out with her friends. 

I think Lucas thinks I still have feelings for her, and so might be trying to keep me at a distance. I don't, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little envious and bitter about my best friend going out with someone I felt so strongly for, who rejected me. Whatever the reason for his blocking me out, it's been seriously tearing me up to see him grow so much socially and never invite me to do anything, especially considering we'd promised each other many times in the past that if either of us get to a better place socially, we'd help the other out. 

My other best friend, let's call him Aidan, had gotten really close to me only in the last year, and we always had really meaningful conversations and felt close, but in the last two months, he's been doing pretty much the same as Lucas, but not as much. They've been hanging out together a lot and never inviting me, despite Aidan telling me so many times that we'd hang out loads over summer and help each other out. My guess is that Lucas has been talking to Aidan about me, a lot. I have been cold around Lucas lately at band practice (literally the only times I see him lately, because he has to see me), very cold at times, but only because I feel like if I'm nice and warm towards him, it'll let him think that it's ok that he's blocking me out and that he can continue to do it. 

Lucas ignored my last message to him last week, but used to message me every single day. Aidan has been responding, but just barely, saying yes or no or literally just "you'll be fine" if I tell him anything that's bothering me, or "I'm grand" if I ask him how he's doing. This is weird because of how deep our conversations were before and how honest we were with each other. 

It's tearing me up and I need to know. I've spoken about it to my counsellor but he keeps urging me to take the "path I most see fit" and all this. I need to know because I don't really hang out with anyone else, except a couple of people from school occasionally, and I have too much time on my hands to keep thinking about this and driving myself insane. I have a long message typed out to Aidan but I can't decide whether to send it or not. 

Any help at all will be appreciated so much. Thank you. 

**TL;DR: My best friend of six years has been blocking me out and ignoring me, and my other best friend has been doing the same but hanging out way more with friend 1, and I think they have a huge problem with me but aren't saying anything. Do I confront one of them, risking the reaction of "you're imagining things" and the inevitable awkwardness, but also possibly resulting in honesty and a resolve to all of this, or do I just try to wait and see if it passes with time?**

<TEXT> I'd say invest in a Zoom H1 - they're cheap and sound amazing. I use mine to record all my music, and if you set the input level to 18 and place it a few feet away from the kit, at about the height level of your crash cymbal - you'll get a great sound. Just make sure to EQ it a little bit when you put the track into the mixing/production software you use. I just put up the treble and bass a little bit so it pops and add a little bit of reverb sometimes. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN05vJtCE9I) is a good example! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so much for the detailed response! I didn't even think of the potential benefit of being able to switch between the two, or even just being as proficient with ghost notes in the right hand as with the left. I've been really interested in possibly trying to play open handed for a while, because my two favourite drummers play open handed (Ilan and Josh Eppard from Coheed and Cambria), but I just figured everything was so drilled in it would take too much work. But your comment makes me think it's actually worth a shot. I'm 18 so I mean I'm still relatively early in my drumming "life" or whatever it would be called, and about to start studying music in college, so now would definitely be the time! Cheers for that, man. (also, fuckin' sweet playing in that cover) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree. Though a lot of the lyrics in their earlier work certainly appealed to a younger "angry emo kid" audience, I don't think it was *made* for them, or pandering at all. I think it was still very much a personal and genuine thing for Oli, writing lyrics. He just happened to be something of an "angry emo kid" himself for a lot of that time. 

Like a song like Suicide Season is so personal and nearly specific in its lyrics, there's no way Oli just pulled it out of his ass because he thought it was what people wanted to hear. And they had so many songs about addiction, not every angry emo kid, or member of a general younger audience, has a serious addiction to something dangerous, to my knowledge. The subject matter on the songs we've heard so far from TTS seem to just be about literally being sad or angry with life or at someone, with nothing deeper at all going on. There's no mystery. I don't mean to let on like I think they were ever the most lyrically complex or amazing band ever, they never were, but this is still weak by the standards of their previous work imo. </TEXT>

The "forest for the trees" line, "lots of nerve, not a lot of spine", "I'll forget but I'll never forgive you", "you broke my heart". And come on, "You can run, but you cant hide"? Seriously? Oli sounds great and the music is cool and I really like the main synth line because it sounds really original and fresh in this genre, but those lyrics just do nothing for me. Also, the chorus, "If I was you" just sounds a little childish, and maybe I'm just being a dick, but I surely it should be "If I were you"? I don't know. I'm a picky bastard when I'm tired. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Here's a cool explanation that Matt retweeted:**

This video is extremely weird but I think it has a meaning and I might know what it is. Let's break this down.

-The Old People Playing The Song: I believe this section, as well as the whole video represents what some Trivium fans think whenever the band comes out with new stuff. So many people have been saying that they "miss the old Trivium" and that's exactly what this video provides; an old Trivium.

-The Old People Dancing: These people represent these very same fans. The people who sit around and complain about how Trivium's new music is bad and prefer to jam out to the old Trivium. Old people often have trouble accepting new things, especially music.

-The Weird Dude Hugging The Picture Of Washington: I believe this also represents the inability to let go of the past. He's hugging the picture and seems to be very happy with it. He probably wouldn't be very happy if someone was to take it from him and give him a new one.

-The Arm Wrestling: This could represent the overcoming of obstacles that others cannot. The big guy represents Matt Heafy's intensity; his screaming that people miss so much. The other guys can't get over him but Matt managed to beat him.

-The Real Trivium: The real Trivium is seen preforming random activities instead of playing. This could show that they don't care about the backlash and would much rather do what they want instead of the traditional things that people expect from them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I could appreciate the attempts to recreate an early Experience-style sound with the new music they had to make for the performance parts, but I just found it cringy. It was really obvious that it was music made in a conscious effort to just sound like Jimi - and not music made by Jimi himself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I'm not saying to necessarily "wait to feel better about yourself" first. I'm saying put the work that you would put into losing weight, into feeling better about yourself - seeing a doctor, a therapist, opening up to friends, making more of an effort to be sociable, whatever. This post was aimed at people who literally cannot stand the sight of themselves without a shirt on and devote huge amounts of thought to how disgusting they are physically, which is what I was for a very long time. My point is that if you have the capacity to hate one aspect of yourself that much, that "capacity to hate" will definitely stay after you lose the weight. It'll just spill to other areas. So for that reason, I think it's best to work on yourself emotionally and mentally before anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I disagree - something similar happened to me after a long time of trying to motivate myself with self hatred and bitterness - eventually I was able to keep going because I just needed to change my view of myself so badly, and lost a lot of weight, and then I felt a lot better because people were giving me compliments all the time. And then after about a month, after that wore off, all the negativity from before came back and just found a place in other areas of myself, and if anything it was stronger because of the disappointment that losing weight didn't make me actually like myself.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I said that you should accept who you are, and what weight you are, while *also* accepting that it needs to change. I don't mean accept your current or "before" weight in a loving way, I just mean to tolerate it. Accept it to the point where you won't feel a flood of bitterness towards yourself everytime you pass a mirror when you're wearing no shirt, accept it to the point where you won't be constantly aware of how "bad" you look, and how others might be perceiving you. 

I just mean to tolerate your current weight, while accepting that you need to work hard to change it to a weight that you can accept in a different way, a more loving way. </TEXT>

<WRITING>
<TITLE> Having a mindset of pure self resentment over your body and image when you start trying to lose weight is as bad, if not worse, than having a mindset that you're just trying it out and you don't ultimately care if it really makes any difference because, really, you're content with being overweight. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-18 02:44:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is just something I have to tell myself over and over again; 

Hating yourself to the point where you feel like you can use this hate to run faster than, lift more weights than, and just work harder in general than those who have "healthy" or "normal" motivation will most likely result in swift failure, and further self hatred. If you do slip up (binging on food after three days of basically starving, not doing any exercise for two days etc.), you will just detest yourself more than when you started, and those negative thoughts and feelings will weigh you down mentally and physically to the point where you will find it nearly impossible to lift them enough to even get out the door for a run. 

Please, please, if you're about to start losing weight, or have just started, have a healthy mindset. I'm not saying to love your current "before" weight by any means - there wouldn't be much point in trying to lose weight at all if you were 100% satisfied with your it - I'm just saying that it would best to accept who you are now, physically and mentally, while also accepting that you need to change your weight and that you will have to be disciplined and work hard for it. 

Sorry for the very negative post, it's just something I don't hear that many people say too often that I really needed to hear a lot when I started. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd say a lot of people can probably relate to that. I often will have been lying in bed for hours because I'm unable to get up, then a certain thought (usually of something positive someone said about me some time in the past) will pop into my head, and trigger a flood of other positive things that are around me, and I'll be thinking "Come on, it's not that bad! Anything is better than spending your day doing nothing like this!". That usually lasts a minute or so, then I go back to thinking I am literally of negative worth as a human being and will go nowhere in life. This happened for a long time, and I'd constantly ask my mom if I was maybe bipolar and she'd always shrug it off. I had an onset of hypo mania this time last year that confirmed that I am actually bipolar, (though not Bipolar I or II. I'm rapid-cycling bipolar apparently). So it did take a lot to find out that I actually was bipolar. I do wish I'd looked into it properly sooner and gotten medicated, or gotten advice on how to handle it. So I would tell you to definitely properly look into it, even if it's a mild annoyance. It's worth it. 

Also, you say how you've often thought that it's in your head, and you're not really depressed. From what you described it definitely sounds like you are at least mildly depressed, dude. So don't feel bad for seeking a therapist or asking for help! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can relate to the feeling of being undeserving of your family's love so much. During periods of my life when I've been utterly unable to function because of this illness, my mom was there the whole time, desperately trying to help me however she could, booking appointments, many of which clashed with school, staying up late to talk, all this. Through all of it, I felt guilty because I thought a worthless, sad excuse for a person like me didn't deserve it; but I realised, and you have to realise, that while you may feel like you don't deserve their love, *they* don't deserve to have to have their world fall apart if you kill yourself. And because they don't deserve that, they're going to do everything they can to be understanding, compassionate, empathetic and supportive towards you. 

I don't know how much your family knows about your struggles at the moment, but I'm guessing that their main concern is that you stay alive. So, right now, you're ticking that box. You're living up to that wish. Now, they probably have others, and I'd say the next one down the line is that you're happy. So that's next. I'm not going to give you some shit of "learn to accept who you REALLY are! love yourself! cut out negative people! u can do it!!1!!!!" because all of those things (though positive in certain situations) are just overdone and often have the opposite effect to the one intended. So I'll just ask you to take a step back, and look at where you are. You've got access to the internet, you've got a house, you've got family. I don't know what led you to where you are mentally right now, but if it's addiction, you can look to others for help; don't try to quit all by yourself, trust me, it won't work. Look to /r/getdisciplined. That sub is also amazing (particularly the top posts/ all time) if you find that you kinda spend all your days getting up late and wasting the day away on escapism. Seriously, it's fantastic. 

Obviously, the end goal is to have you tolerate yourself, even like yourself. I'm not going to tell you that the first step is accepting who you really are and liking yourself, and then implementing changes to your routine/ health/ general life, because chances are, the person you think you "really are" is, as you said, useless and stupid and lazy, and undeserving of love. So yeah, dude, don't go accepting that any time soon. Change comes first. Force it if you have to (you'll probably have to, a lot). If you keep going and persevering, trust me you **will** notice a change in how others view you and how you view yourself. And then you can take this and run with it to fuel other change. This is when you can work on really finding a passion (if you haven't already) that is productive and positive, that you can turn to when you feel low, and that you can start to define yourself by, and ultimately have a better idea of yourself; it could be writing music, writing poetry, working out, anything at all that could be considered creative or genuinely productive. 

So yeah, sorry for the wall of text. Apologies if none of this is any help; these are just things I wish someone drilled into my head years ago, and I really want to help you.

You'll be ok, man. Trust me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean, I still love the song. It's not really Radiohead to me (in that I try to think of it as just a song on its own, not in the context of albums like OK Computer), but I love the song as a simple, relatable rock/grunge/indie angsty anthem. It was written when Thom was very young and conveys that apathetic, self hating anger and loneliness really, really powerfully. Obviously it isn't on the level of their subsequent albums in terms of sheer quality but it bugs me to see people blatantly hate on it, or that it "depresses" them to know that the album that it's from exists, when it's the song that initially got them international attention, and a platform to give the world the later material that everyone regards as some of the best music ever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm about 60% shock and 40% sheer joy right now! I got about double what I realistically expected, and all A's and B's, with an A in higher level English, which is insane for me. It was kind of emotional because I've been quite sick in the last three years and missed about two thirds of 6th year because I kind of had an incident this time last year that really messed me up for a while, and missed most of 4th and 5th year because of my illness, but in the last two months before the leaving I really got down to it and just opened every past exam paper online and worked out what is most likely to come up, and learned that off really well; and it worked. I can't believe it. I got 375 points, which is totally average in the eyes of most, but really way more than I hoped for, and I'm so happy about it. 

I (somehow) got 600 points out of 600 in my audition for the School of Music in Cork, so because of that I only needed to get 190 points in my Leaving and two C's at higher level, and I did just that. I got about twice as much as I needed in the LC in order for it to add up to the overall required amount of points to get in, so unless the points go up by about 200, I got my course!

Because of the weird/confused/awful/unhealthy/generally shit state I was in, I was heavily considering leaving school last December and trying to find whatever work I could get for the next few years, and go back and do the Leaving in my twenties, but I'm so glad I pulled through and found the resolve to really get down to it in the final stretch; even if I did only start really working about two years after everyone else, I did it and - even if it sounds kind of arrogant and quite douchey - I'm really proud of myself.

I hope everyone else got what they wanted, and if not, just remember that there are always ways, and when you finally get what you do want down the line, it'll be all the better because you'll have worked that much more for it.

**edit**: Whoever gilded me, thank you so much. This was a really personal comment and I'm glad you liked it enough to be fantastic and give me gold 33 </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's funny because I'm fairly sure he didn't think anyone would actually see this (not that he would be very embarrassed, but it probably just didn't cross his mind); but I just skimmed over Shakira's page because I read it was the most liked on facebook or something so I was curious, and it turns out that comments on any post by pages you've liked appear first. Makes me wonder what kind of things other well known figures comment that most people wouldn't see... </TEXT>

<TEXT> John Green writes teen novels, for teenagers. You just said you liked him when you were a teenager but loathe him now - I don't think that's actually a real criticism of him. He doesn't write for adults, so most people here aren't his target audience. Everyone saying he is a terrible writer here doesn't seem to get that he's writing for a certain demographic which, in this day and age, really goes for that style; the sort of pseudo-deep, poetic (in a sort of disingenuous way sometimes) tone. He writes for teens and he's very good at doing that. I just see lots of people on this sub complaining about him, the main complaints being that his writing style seems like it's pandering to teenagers and is immature. It's like criticising Stephen King for his books being too scary and mature. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well Neverwhere came before AG, so I wouldn't let your feelings of the latter influence it that much. I don't think Stardust is a follow up to American Gods, but definitely I think it'd be the perfect book to read after getting through all of AG. The shortness and straight forward (but still really cool and interesting) story is perfect after such a long story like American Gods that you have to put a lot of time and thought into. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll keep it in mind for sure! I think I was just expecting a similar tone and feel to AG, not the more comedic style that's actually in Anansi Boys. I liked it, but I didn't love it like I hoped I would. I thought it was really funny at parts, but I thought all the characters, other than Fat Charlie, Spider and Mr. Nancy to be pretty boring and the plot kinda plodding and uninteresting. Definitely would have liked it more if hadn't just come off American Gods.  </TEXT>

I've been trying to wait until I can properly commit to reading Neverwhere because I want to properly enjoy it, as I've heard great things, so I haven't actually read it yet - and the only other I've read is Anansi Boys as it's set in the AG universe. I honestly didn't really enjoy Anansi Boys very much. So I'd say read Stardust, or tackle Neverwhere! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lots of people seem to find Gaiman pretentious, it seems to be the main criticism of him. I think that that style of writing just fit American Gods' tone, though - I really can't imagine that story being told in a more run of the mill, straight forward style. I think Gaiman was going for a sort of classic story-teller feel - as in, telling this story to a hushed group of people by firelight. So, coming across mysterious and as if something is being hidden constantly, and as if the speaker sees things differently to the listener and has more experience in certain areas, in this case the history of Gods and everything. I'm sorry I'm phrasing all this so terribly (arguing a point is hrd), but I see that sort of criticism a lot and never really get a chance to argue it. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think this is an interesting sort of discussion. For me, it's Anathema's 'Weather Systems'. It opens incredibly strong and every song is filled with emotion and power and amazing composing, and the final track is, for me, basically the official theme song of frisson. It's just incredible. But there is one of the tracks that just doesn't sit well with me, it doesn't flow nearly as well as the others for some reason; The Storm Before The Calm. I honestly think it's only an alright song, which is disappointing because I consider every single other song on the album to be incredibly strong, both musically and lyrically. 

Does anyone else have albums like this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, if anything, I'd say we're sick of the past. Bands like Of Mice and Men, We Came As Romans and now BMTH are trying to revive this early 2000s, nu metal/ hard radio rock sound, which died over a decade ago - I don't see it as a 'bad evolution' of these bands sounds, really; I see it as a devolution (pretentious word of the day yay). The thing the annoys me most about people who pride themselves on being "accepting" of the new styles of these bands is that they attack people who aren't happy with it in comment sections by saying things like "these people can't accept change!"/"let the band grow!"/ "nothing new will ever come about in music if bands don't change!". I hate this, because I welcome change, I really love it a lot of the time. I thought Bring Me The Horizon's change from the Suicide Season sound to the There Is A Hell sound was fantastic, I thought Architects changes, first to a more melodic sound, followed by a heavier, groove sound were both great. I love blessthefall's change to a more serious, darker sound on the last couple of albums. 

So I think it's bullshit when people say we can't accept change. Like, no. What is happening, in my opinion, with things like the new BMTH songs isn't change, it's borrowing a dead sound that most people were happy to see dead. It's especially disappointing with Bring Me because they've proven how innovative they can be with their melding of Post Rock and metalcore on There Is A Hell. I never liked that early 2000s sound, and don't like it now; I don't think that means I'm stuck in the past, really. If anything, I would say Bring Me and OM M and the others are a bit stuck in the past if they're so eager to bring back the sounds of their adolescence, rather than forging a new sound!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just curious, as I'm actually properly reading the books for the first time since seeing all the movies years ago and finding that I'm picturing some characters a lot differently to how I first saw them in the movies. Like, I remember what Victor Krum looked like in the GoF movie, but as I'm reading him, I'm imagining him much differently - just the way he comes across, I'm picturing a sort of lanky, but strong, awkwardish guy (as described), who comes to life on the pitch. He also has longish hair and a badass beard. (I think beards and long hair are cool on characters that are supposed to be really cool idk)

Also, the obvious thing of Harry's hair, how it'd described as persistently messy in the books, but it's perfect in the movies. I definitely imagine it differently in my head as I'm reading.

Who did you find yourself picturing differently to how they are in the movies? </TEXT>

But seriously, it's very bland imo. This will probably sound horribly pretentious or whatever but it just sounds a bit unoriginal. The chord structure is used in *everything* and there's nothing very interesting going on. That video teaser was very misleading, there wasn't a single scream that I heard.

Overall, I'm very disappointed. I really hoped this would be the one to bring people back in, but honestly I prefer Happy Song. And I don't even like Happy Song that much.

<TEXT> I just decided to try it, as I'd had a pretty terrible couple of days before hand, a lot of it to do with being on the computer and what generally goes along with being exposed to the infinite escapism-hole that is the internet. I ended up having a really productive day, doing a lot of chores I wouldn't usually have the energy or will to do, and being more creative than I had in ages, writing a lot of music and being productive in other creative ways. I ate really well too, and didn't fap. But most importantly, I went to bed without a sense of shame or guilt for having wasted the day - I felt refreshed and a bit proud that I managed to pull myself away from the thing that consumes so much of my time and thought. I slept better than I had in ages, because I didn't have all this build up energy from sitting in front of the computer and not being active all day. 

I'm sure I'm not the first one around here to find that going a day (or longer) with no computer/internet is very helpful, but I thought it was worth posting if only just to urge people to just designate one day a week to going completely without your computer or internet, except for the minimum you might need for work or school. It seriously can do wonders. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mine is from the hostful "Airport Intro", when they're recapping Comic Con, and Chris talks about how, during the Man of Steel panel, a guy in a Superman shirt came to the mic to ask a question, and actually broke down in tears because he was just so happy to be witnessing all this cool stuff that's going on in cinema and stuff. Chris says he went down and just gave him a hug and that this moment just made him so happy because it was such a moment of positivity, and there's like a really positive and mildly cheesy vibe kind of being created on the podcast at this stage, and then Jonah says really bluntly, "It sounds like he could be manic depressive." I don't even know why but I just found that so fucking funny, the way he takes a really positive, light story and puts a really dark twist on it out of nowhere, and you could tell it kind of pissed off Chris.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm just in a bit of an awkward situation. I have mine coming up at the end of August, and over the past few months I've been wanting to go less and less. Mostly because I barely know my date; I only asked her because I used to have a bit of a thing for her a long time ago, and we spoke a lot in a pub about a year ago, and I left it too late to ask the girl who my heart was set on asking. The girl I am going with has a boyfriend so it'd only be as friends, but we've spoken like twice ever and I'm a pretty quiet person who is mildly awful at holding a conversation with someone I don't know, so I'm afraid it'd just be the most awkward night of my life, and that's without even mentioning the dancing (there's dancing, right? God I really know nothing about the Debs). On top of all that, I really could just do without seeing all those faces from school again, I really want to dissociate myself from everyone there as that whole environment just holds bad stuff in my brain and yeah. As horribly negative as that sounds, I moved on at graduation and I'm done with the place and the people, for the most part. 

So yeah. Just thought I'd check and see how people would think of someone just not going, figured there's no harm in it!

**TL;DR:**    **I am weird and would likely have an internal meltdown of anxiety at my Debs, so would rather not go. Is that bad, do many people choose not to go?**

(I'm really just thinking about this too much aren't I)


**Edit: Thanks so much for the advice everyone - I've thought a lot about it and basically I think that the regret of not having kind of given it a shot and stepped out of my comfort zone would suck more than the awkwardness of going, so I paid for my ticket today.**

**Hopefully I don't fuck everything up too bad!** </TEXT>

The woman is wealthy beyond most people's wildest dreams, and ultimately it's because she had sex with a moderately famous guy, and has cameras following her places. She lives a more comfortable life than 99% of people, a life which hasn't really been earned by any real talent or hard work, and being that way in a world where most people work their ass off and don't even get a fraction of that success will definitely result in some jealousy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I initially had a jerk reaction to be annoyed with it, as it is such a departure, but I actually really like it. That riff is fucking sweet in a groove/Rage Against The Machine/bouncy sort of way, and the big scream in the mid section delivers so hard. Also, the chants will be fun as hell live. 

It's different, and I can see why it's divisive. But at least this shows how willing to continue evolving they are; I guarantee that (presuming the whole album is in this vein) either on the album after this one or the next one after that, they will miss being heavier and go back to it in one way or another. I mean, they can't possibly just keep getting softer like this, at this rate, two albums down the line they'll be pop punk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm just really concerned, because all this talk of Jon coming back as Azor Ahai, being the personification of "Ice and Fire" due to being a Stark and a Targaryen, and having a showdown with The Night King (which would lend meaning to the staredown at Hardhome) has been getting me so damn excited. Like, I can't express how much I want this to happen and how incredible it would be to see it all play out on screen. I know some people say it's too obvious and would be boring in a way for that reason, but I honestly would love it.
But surely GRRM has heard all this, and I doubt he would want to just do what everyone expects and wants. He would fuck with people's expectations, as he always has.
I'm just worried and I thought I'd see if anyone else shared these worries, or if my concerns are kind of baseless and I shouldn't be as concerned. </TEXT>

I really was hoping Oli would start to stretch himself more as a lyricist beyond the whole "inner turmoil/ trapped in my head/ I'm drowning/ don't drown with me" thing. Like, how much more can he possibly get from that creatively? It's also just frustrating because the whole genre overuses this whole concept so, so much. Hopefully the whole album will be a bit more varied. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure why, but I'm incredibly excited for the music video for this. It's just such a straight up, simple and happy song, I'll be interested to see what they do with it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> What's with all the mentions of the circlejerk? I just shared this because I thought it was a funny, awkward moment. I'd find it just as funny and worth sharing if Jake Luhrs were having his faith "insulted". I don't think everything to do with Matty Mullins posted here should become a debate/conflict between "pro circlejerk" and "anti circlejerk" factions. It's just a funny video. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, we can't assume Soupy knew about Matty's beliefs in the first place, I wouldn't be surprised if Soupy didn't know a whole lot about MMF considering their bands aren't really the same genre anyway. The joke clearly isn't directed only at Matty, but more just a general joke I guess. That, with the fact that he clearly pointed it out in a playful, joking way, and not a malicious way, kinda does shine a negative light on Matty for taking as a big insult, imo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think it was douchey that he chose a religious tattoo, if it was in fact his favourite. It's just the way he acts as if Soupy personally insulted him and his faith, like he could have been so much more lighthearted about choosing that one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really excited for this. I liked the sound of it from the Warped webcast before it was removed, despite the performance being pretty bad. 

I am hoping the rest of the album will be a little less "safe" though, this song felt very much like it could have been off any of their other albums, or from most other metalcore bands today, to be honest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The 30 second sample is SO much better in the context of the song. I was a bit disappointed by the sample, maybe because I still have memories of how phenomenal it was hearing Domino as the first song on The Afterman albums, but after hearing the whole song with the intro, I'm so fucking into it. Such a summer vibe and it's like old, Blood Red Summerish Coheed but more mature. 

I love it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just asking because I saw it in the shop the other day, and I guess I used to really like energy drinks before I stopped drinking them, so it'd be nice to be able to have something that . Any nutritional information I've looked up just tells me it has extra sweeteners and as much caffeine as normal Red Bull, so I don't know how to tell if I should still stay away from it. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, thanks for bringing this to my attention. [This](http://www.thomann.de/ie/pearl_wood_fiberglass_satin_cocoa.htm) kit is absolutely gorgeous and youtube videos tell me it plays well, so I'll definitely keep it in mind, cheers! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've heard so many good things about that kit, I always played one for my exams in the School of Music I did my grades in. Would it be a good kit for a player who plays mostly harder rock stuff, as in letlive. and heavier Led Zeppelin sort of style? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Starting college in September to study drums for four years, and looking to upgrade to a better kit from my beginner one I've been playing since I started seven years ago. What are some great mid range kits, around $900-1300, and where should I look for second hand kits? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-29 23:37:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's just been dawning on me that I really, really should upgrade, as my current kit (it's an Astro beginner kit, it's pretty awful sounding but it plays ok) is just falling apart and there are bits missing. I've been looking at this [Pearl Vision Maple kit with Walnut finish](http://www.thomann.de/ie/pearl_vml_studio_walnut_802.htm). I've been trying to find a Sonor Essential Force kit without the hardware and no second rack tom as I wouldn't use it, but I've had no luck so far. 

Also, where would one look to find second hand kits? I'd definitely be into buying a better kit second hand for a similar price. 

Any and all advice greatly appreciated, cheers!  </TEXT>
