<TEXT> It does have a lot of great, immersive scenes - it just doesn't quite gel together at times. The music is at fault here, too. A lot of tracks are [great] 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZQ4KdowPKg) but the love themes are schmaltzy, providing no dramatic tension. Hence the boredom. The two scenes involving characters reading lists don't help either. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why would this be a good suggestion for people who hate horror movies? The movie is downright pandering to horror fans, which OP   wife are not. 

What about something like [The Invitation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2400463/) ? Or [The Babadook](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2321549/?ref_=nv_sr_1)? </TEXT>

<TEXT> A female killer is a constant trope in giallos, i.e. Italian slashers from the 60's and 70's. Look into the films by Dario Argento and Mario Bava and you'll find multiple examples of female killers. Since giallos are "whodunits" I don't want to give the specific titles away. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They hire directors who mostly have worked with TV, which means the producers have more creative control. Thus the movies can conform to the same safe, bland look. Plus, most of the budget goes to the main stars, which leaves little in terms of production. 

And an over-reliance on green screen, it reminds me of the star wars prequels: http://imgur.com/pdxDoLI </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey there, a couple of weeks ago I posted about my project in popular education, [Cinetrii](http://www.cinetrii.com). It's a tool which tries to find artistic lineage between films by parsing written reviews.

I'm slowly rolling out a change to the algorithm so that it favors popular films less. For example, the results for Tarantino's work is now more [relevant](http://cinetrii.com?i=tt3460252) than it used to be. Previously, a given Tarantino film query resulted mostly in other Tarantino films. </TEXT>

I am thinking of implementing some sort per-title rating system so users can vote if they think the tree is interesting or not. That way I can easier survey the results and modify the algorithm. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the last couple of months I've worked on a film discussion-related experiment called [Cinetrii](http://cinetrii.com?i=tt4062536).

<TEXT> My title is a bit misleading. Pasting an explanation from elsewhere:

The goal was to infer the artistic influences at work for a given movie. Of course, there are multiple biases at play here. Ive already covered the unequal distribution of available reviews in my original blog post. Furthermore, art is only as interesting as the conversation around it, and not all movies warrant fine-grained reflection. Even for those movies that do, the connections are mostly speculative. Critics are not clairvoyant, they cant know what directors were inspired by. Cinetrii approximates the perception of movie critics more than anything else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you. I'm continually tuning the heuristics, but in many cases the lack of available data produce some very noisy results. The intent is really to trace re-use of motifs, plots etc for educational purposes.
