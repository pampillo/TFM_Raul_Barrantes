<TEXT> No, but there is a level of the tower where there is a version of the Gunslinger that is released that is a SMALL, little film with arthouse sensibilities depicting an existential struggle between Roland and the Man in Black, showcasing a vision that Sai King made iconic. They could get onto the NEXT CYCLE stuff on say, film four or five (which would be much larger budget TENTPOLE type releases with corresponding PR), but by that time the franchise would be a thing unto itself. 

A small, thoughtful intro to the series is what is needed, not some mashup best of compilation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A TV show would be ideal. It would allow enough time to get into the other worlds multiverse that to be honest, the movie doesn't stand a chance in hell of even attempting to nail. King only did it by tying the DT series into many of his other novels. The film doesn't have that going for it -- unless it throws out allusions IT or the Stand, but regardless, there is no depth of work to draw upon, leaving the film to stand for itself.

And we haven't even seen an official trailer. Just an image or two and a poster.

<TEXT> The journey IS the point. Sai King gets that but the moviegoing audience does NOT. Not do the suits @ Sony. Making this the next iteration of the cycle is a brilliant idea, but making it less than a tweaked version of the novels is disrespectful to the fans and to the source material. We deserve to see 7 great DT films, at least. At yet, we're probably just going to get this one because no one at Sony has the balls to negotiate contracts like Feige over at Marvel. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hate to say it here but Marvel knows how to make wide release movies that hit the right beats time and time again. Sony is struggling in that vein and this should be a sure fire thing but then again we're working on a script from a hack (AG hasn't done anything good really, ever) trying to adapt one of the most singular visions ever put to paper. Having said that, it should be possible because King's opus is imminently cinematic ... I really hope they just put the brakes on it go back for even more reshoots, hell even a rewrite and release it in 2018. get it right and you've got a franchise for a decade or more, blow it and you're Paramount. </TEXT>

<TEXT> These photos reveal something the government is especially guilty of doing: over-classifying tons of data. There is so much information that gets stamped with NATSEC clearance for reasons that can only be explained by lawyers familiar with NATSEC legalese and they certainly can't comment about it (nor are they going to lobby against a proliferation of it). Rather we the people need to take a look at declassified data and go WTF are we classifying this for? At what cost? For what purpose? Everything costs money. Even if it's just the stamps.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is being marketed but not to a wide audience. They're doing a slow burn aimed at their core, but like others have said, I'm sure the powers that be at Sony saw a cut and demanded a bunch of re-shoots, hopefully some additional scenes, better CGI ... maybe a better ending, who knows? Only time will tell. I'd actually be fine with Sony pushing the release back from summer to fall or winter and taking even MORE time to make sure what they release is worth the Dark Tower brand because if they play this right, and god knows they should, they could have a HUGE franchise that they could mine for decades.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Rental gear on Bali, had a fluctuating pressure gauge that I should have mentioned on my first dive. On second dive, we stayed down deep for a bit looking for a pygmy seahorse -- which we eventually found, but by the time we were coming back up slowly, and I was at 50 bar I found it incredibly hard to breath. I would get a little bit at first, then the gauge would drop to zero and it was like trying to drink out of a closed straw. One of the guys we dove with the day before reported a similar issue. Couple that with a longer than normal safety stop (+8 minutes ASC warning since we stayed down too long on our second dive after a deep first dive) and I started freaking out a bit and shared air with our guide. Luckily, I didn't just pop up but remained somewhat calm and shared air. Scary experience. 

Lesson learned: Always speak up about any issues with your gear -- especially rental gear, immediately.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What DC needs is a personality who gets their IP and who gets film and who can guide a creative vision across multiple properties. ZS is okay but his vision is a little long in the tooth and the overall scheme seems unfocused. Marvel made a jigsaw puzzle, DC is doing ego knows what.

Haven't seen SS but from all opinions seems like it is a great marketing success (great trailers) but not so good overall. Kinda like much of ZS's work...

<TEXT> Partly I think this is due to the scope of these problem, which is systemic to our culture. There isn't an easy fix for the problem and in fact a large part of the cure we've been sold (drugs from big pharma) is a huge part of the problem. Thinking there are prescription solutions to everything ignores that there are very real structural issues with living in a vaguely capitalistic society </TEXT>

<TITLE> Having some Mild Barotrauma after a week of diving! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-06 02:05:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Back from a week of diving in Roatan (amazing BTW) and I'm experiencing what I've self-diagnosed as a case of MEBT (middle-ear barotrauma) after looking around online. I got back late Sunday but the first time I really noticed the symptoms, ringing in the ear, a feeling like I'm underwater, some slight discomfort, began on Monday morning. Since then it's persisted mainly localized to my right ear. From what I've read online, and from what DAN emailed me back after inquiring advice from a medic, it seems like the only thing to do it wait ... and see and hope it isn't a perforated eardrum of an inner ear barotrauma or something worse. I'm taking sudafed but I'm a little worried about how long it's going to take since I don't have insurance and don't want to go to a DR if the problem is just going to clear up... Anyone with any experience, let me know how it goes for you.  </TEXT>

Part of the problem here is selling LSD ... at least as far as I'm concerned it's something usually shared among friends, not something one looks towards as a money making venture. He should have stuck to selling pot -- the charges would have been a lot less severe. Hopefully his parents get him a good lawyer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What this means is the Government isn't valuing these employees properly, hence their desire to go to the private sector. This is actually good news in some way, as they're likely to be replaced by people less qualified, with more to gripe about (being underpaid, etc.). Of course, it also means there are private concerns looking at monetizing the prosecution of digital crimes, something that some of Reddit's userbase (to say nothing of r/darknetmarkets subscribers) would find of the highest interest.

Then again, let's remember how RU was caught and how TSR was actually taken down, not by some insanely gifted investigators, but rather by incredibly shitty OPSEC.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Loved Idris, loved Beasts of No Nation, but let's be real here, his performance was NOT supporting. He was the lead performance in the film -- to nominate him and give him an award for supporting in kind of ingenuous, but such is the game in Hollywood. I'm glad someone gave him an award for the performance -- he deserves it! </TEXT>

At any rate, good on her for getting out but it's not that easy for my ex without abandoning her mother -- or rather confronting her fears of abandoning her mother, and it's not that easy for her daughter, who has been taught its also the only way to see her nana again ... through adherence to this JW indoctrination spiel.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not a question of "deserving" it more, it's a question of socializing losses for those who can least afford them...vendors are making absurd profit margins unless they're doing something majorly wrong, so they CAN afford to absorb some additional losses given the inherent need for trust between two parties implied by the DNM escrow system, more than the average user can afford to make an additional buy ... I get that people on both sides are getting fucked by others (LE, exit-scammers, etc.) but there is a departure from what you're calling baseline ethical behavior when a vendor cancels orders knowing that those who placed their faith in him to deliver a product for the money they put up will now possibly get neither. 

It's sort of like the argument that rich people should pay more in taxes because, well, they should because they have more of it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel for you but there has to be some level of trust implicit in the "deal", no? What you're doing is just dumping users who actually did put their hard earned money into coins  (which they can't access either despite the cancelation) into the same boat that you're in -- being unable to do anything until AG sorts itself out. Is it fair for you to lose more by sending out product that you might not get paid for... I'm not sure. The ethics of it all break down at a certain point but when looking at the profit margins, I have to say that there are, or at least should be, a level of acceptable losses inherent to the game for those of you vending. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reading comprehension fail. Meth, cocaine, amphetamines, heroin, etc. are all drugs, which if the US had any sensible policy, would be available for purchase by consenting adults, leaving cartels with violent/dangerous things to pursue, like weapons, humans, etc. Of course, without a BS drug policy initiative to prosecute, a lot more law enforcement and military resources could be brought to bear on the surviving business of the cartels, but that would be too simple and make too much sense.

These people were clearly idiots not because they had the gall to tell others to show up to their court, but because they didn't have the force to back up their orders. This is the only real reason most people adhere to laws, show up to court, etc. because the federal government (and local governments post 9/11) have extremely long arms and more force than they need. </TEXT>

Bran is absolutely going to figure into the endgame with the walkers and will likely end up sacrificing himself in order to ensure the survival or another Stark ... Rickon perhaps.

<TEXT> All of society suffers from mental delusions, the concept of money itself being just one such societal delusion, to say nothing of the delusion of infinite growth, underpinning the whole "for the kids" mentality on a global scale of finite resources, but couldn't agree more that it's none of our business really what AB's mental state is at this point in time. I'm not sure how she's exactly newsworthy, but I think some of her behavior is what I would constitute as a rational response to the insane amount of focus put on her every move. Hell even when the girl doesn't do something (like change her hair or whathaveyou), everyone notices ... I think that kind of attention would drive any sane person into a strange, if not toxic place, but that's just me and some celebs seem to handle it just fine, then again, for AB at this time, maybe this IS fine. Hard to say, microscoped at her age, I'd be called troubled at best. </TEXT>

Until until the training and toxic culture of these militarized police departments is seriously examined by people on the outside, there will continue to be a gulf-like divide from the population and those ostensibly serving to protect and serve them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing about LOST was that, we as viewers know we're watching a show with actors and we suspend our disbelief if the fiction is good enough, and especially for the first season, maybe two or two and a half seasons, the show was really great fiction, but like the X-Files before it, LOST collapsed under the weight of its own distended mythology. And what happened was the characters, no matter how fully realized or articulated or conflicted or REAL they seemed, were flailing about in a context which had no internal consistency or plan, which made their actions, and ultimately themselves lose any meaning for the audience. 

Of course, it's the characters stupid, to paraphrase Stephen King, but it's also the context of those characters, and while mystery is interesting, what LOST exposed is that there needs to be an endgame planned from the start </TEXT>

<TEXT> Stories like this should HORRIFY everyone, but it's not even going to be a blip on the radar of America's cognitive dissonance. The time to really reform the Healthcare system is now but it won't happen because there are so many selfish people sucking off the teat of exponentially increasing fees for everything that there is no incentive for anyone inside to change things and anyone outside who suggests it is laughed at like, what Obamacare didn't happen? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lack of mental health services is a major problem in America, but we chose to ignore it because of the idiots who can't accept the fact that socialized healthcare is the only civilized solution to the problem ... instead we pay lip service to caring for each other (and being a Christian nation) while the marginalized, the poor and those without a stable family structure to support them slip through the cracks and end up burdening the criminal justice system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whether the FBI used parallel construction or not, and it looks like they didn't even need to in order to gain access to the servers, this should be a lesson to all DNM operators that the time to step up security is NOW. 

It should also be a reminder to this community here that we should, as a whole strive to see through the BS and help each other out as much as possible because the Feds are watching and only through eternal vigilance will any of these marketplaces continue to operate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> These are these people who claim to be depressed. Okay? Apparently in this land of plenty. This richest nation in the history of the world (we're so proud of saying that). Some super markets have a hundred thousand items in them. We have 19 million americans claiming to be depressed, and some of them take medicine for it. Sometimes the medicine for it makes one of them commit suicide, and that depresses the shit out of the rest of them. Then you only have these people that think they're depressed. They think they're depressed, because they saw the commercial on TV, and the doctor looked like a good guy, the music sounded kind of peppy. And what the fuck? Probably some of these pills would pick me right the fuck up. Totally fucking hopeless mindset - in the fucking pyramid.

Up at the very top we are guna put the people who are truly sick. The terminally ill. Unforchanetly no hope for a lot of them. Hundreds of thousands of them - no cure for what they have. Some of them there's no cure, because no ones looking for one. Aint enough people sick with it, so there's no money in the cure. Then there's people where there's a cure, but they don't have the money for it. Then there's one who can, but they're to far gone. Then there's one who can get the cure, but they have no social means to get to it so these people aint going anywhere - they should be allowed to commit suicide.

Boom!

<TEXT> As much as some of his ideas are worthy of mass adoption, there is a very simple reason there hasn't been "someone" like him since, because of the simple adage, fuck with the bull you get the horns. I'm sure there are many admins and people running the various DNMs out there who share similar views to DPR, but they aren't going to be vocal or public about airing those views in connection with their market personas, because well that's why the Feds got him, same reason they got Gotti, because the authorities do not like having a nose thumbed at them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's been almost two full weeks since I left. This will be the second weekend. Just broke down crying like a baby in front of my mom, stepdad and brother as I was leaving because instead of saying I've got to get going, I said We've got to get going, guess it was just force of habit but it was enough and to be fair, my mom was there and hugged me away from the men very quickly, but it's tough, I cried for the first hour on the drive back to the city... I'm a little better now but my emotions are raw and I haven't even talked to the wife today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone going through something similar...who used to be the one who fought to keep the marriage together who has now admitted defeat and left only to be almost pulled back by my wife who all of a sudden has realized that she loves me now that I've been gone, all I can say is that the best thing you can do is to move forward WITHOUT him. Wanting your marriage to work badly isn't going to make it so, especially if he isn't interested in making it work.
