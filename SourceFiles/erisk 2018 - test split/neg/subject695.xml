<TEXT> Also, another factor could have been Michael Bloomberg running as an independent if Bernie got the Dem nomination. Bloomberg only decided not to run because he's fond of Hillary and she was moderate enough for him to not be relevant. I'm pondering an alternate world where a lot of centrist and moderate Democrats would have flocked to him in the general to still cause Trump to win. We very well could be stuck with Trump no matter who the Democratic nominee was.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have Dragon Quest vii with orchestra soundtrack and it's not really that much bigger than the midi version. Roughly about 200mb bigger. I know this because I downloaded both versions. It most likely is because the composer doesn't want his music used outside of Japan. He's known to be eccentric and a shitty person. Great musician though.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I need help finding a horror movie from my childhood. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-29 08:34:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been looking for a horror movie I saw on HBO with my dad most likely when I was 4 or 5 years old back in 1984/85 (shit, it even might have been in 1983). From the little that I remember, it took place in a big, old house and there was a small group of young adults there. I don't remember what they were doing there. Maybe they were trying to rescue someone? A couple of scenes have stuck with me. One was where some of the people decided to peer into a hole in a wall and they saw a deformed looking (incest?) woman about to give birth and some doctors were helping her try deliver the baby. Her belly was getting bigger and bigger. I think at some point she notices the people peeking through the hole in the wall. The second thing I remember is one of the young people sees someone they know outside of the building and they get his attention. He yells something and opens his shirt or jacket and he was covered with something black. From what I can remember, they were insects (beetles or scarabs?) crawling all over him. 

My dad died a long time ago (in 1999) and I have not been able to find anyone who has any idea as to what the hell it was that I saw. I would be so happy if someone on Reddit can tell me the name of the movie. </TEXT>

My sister took me to see Silence of the Lambs when I was 10 I wanted to see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 but the theater was sold out. So we went to see SotL instead. The scene where the insane guy splashed his semen on Clarice went above my head. I had no idea what that was. The part where Buffalo Bill had his dick tucked away and pranced around to Q Lazzarus's "Goodbye Horses" had me thinking for days. I did leave the theater saying I thought the movie was  awesome.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So many on here are claiming that everyone knew the WMDs were not being claimed as being nuclear are either liars or forgetful. The Bush administration was going on TV constantly insisting on, "Not wanting the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud." 

 http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/01/10/wbr.smoking.gun/

Cheney on March 16, 2003 edition of Meet the Press said, "[W]e believe he has, in fact, reconstituted nuclear weapons."

I work for the military and I had to agree to an security clearance investigation and my juvenile crime didn't come up. The reason I think a sealed record is not good enough is because during the investigation I was told they would not have difficulty finding sealed records and demand them to be turned over.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a guy, I swear that I have been thinking the exact same thing! Bear with me here, as I have had quite a bit of wine tonight, but the desire and need to have a baby is just one of many things I don't understand about women. To me pregnancy and giving birth is horrific and will drastically change your life forever. It seems to me that having children makes living a normal life next to impossible. When someone tells me, "So and so is having a baby", my thoughts are so fucking what? I applaud you for choosing what's currently best for you and your body and for not caving to peer pressure and societal ideals.  </TEXT>

Here he is pretending to care about the plight of the poor, when all he wanted was a photo op for his vice president campaign. He is a immense believer in Ayn Rand and does not give a fuck about the poor or the middle class for that matter. He is a member of Congress who keeps coming up with budgets that cut social services for the poor. Bush is no longer relevant but Mr Paul is because he still has a lot of power in Congress and is very influential. He may even run for president in 2016. </TEXT>

I do get frustrated occasionally, though. For example, my best friend's fiance twice tried to get two of her friends interested in getting to know me. I was rebuffed both times. She is a kind person and I really appreciated that she was trying to help  but the rejection the second time around made for an awkward ride home. I was gave them the silent treatment and it was not because I was mad at them. On the contrary, I was upset with myself for being so fucking undateable.  </TEXT>

I had my throat stretched after that, but it didn't solve the problem because my allergies do factor into it.

But Capcom did an amazing job of porting Resident Evil 2 to N64. The prerendered backgrounds and characters looked fantastic but fmv was grainy because it had to be condensed.

Just because they did the opposite of what most fans wanted, does not make it creative. Turning Dexter into a lovestruck, bumbling buffoon was the worst thing they could have done and was a real disservice to the fans.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember hearing about that slaughtering and it reminded me of the insane people in the U.S. who killing and committing massacres. Another thing I forgot to mention is that there are laws to prevent insane people from buying guns but there are so many flaws. First, there are a lot people who are mentally ill but never got help, so, they are not in the system when there is a background check. The mental health system here is a goddamn joke because of lack of funding and people who can get help, don't go because they think they will be judged unfairly (turned down from a job, etc.). Second, background checks only apply to gun shops but not to gun expositions or online meaning any nut job can make a purchase. 

If you have any other questions, let me know!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> TL;DR: Politicians are easily corrupted/influenced by lobbying firms and their money. They get people to support guns by playing off their fears and unrest. 

Ay yi yi, where do I even start? It is a complicated mess created by powerful gun lobbyists (National Rifle Association, Gun Manufacturers of America, American Legislative Exchange Council) who gave monetary contributions to the campaigns of politicians (Democrats and Republicans) in hopes of getting pro-gun laws passed.

The gun enthusiast crowd loves to cite that the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution gives them the right to have as many guns as they want. The poorly worded amendment says that a well regulated militia consisting of free citizens will be able to keep and bear arms that shall not be infringed upon. Keep in mind this was written in 1791 when there were fears that the British might try to start another war after American Revolutionary War ended in 1783. In my opinion, the keywords in the amendment are "well regulated", which means the government can limit gun usage. But gun fanatics do not share this view. They proclaim that all citizens should be able to own any kind of guns and their view ultimately won. 

Politicians and gun associations continued to get support for looser gun laws by playing off people's fear of  communist invasion during the Cold War and fear of ethnic minority groups. People were told they need to stockpile in case of a nuclear war. White people (I am white, myself) were (still are?) afraid that minorites were taking over the country in the 1960s and felt they needed to protect themselves in cities where riots took place. Gun supporters argued that ordinary citizens needed to be armed because the police will not be there until after something bad happens. This is why we have the gun laws that we have today. The funny thing is that less people own guns now for the first time in decades but the people who love guns are buying more than ever. 

Currently, the truth is that the vast majority of Americans want more restrictions on guns, but no new laws to regulate the use of high capacity assault weapons will be passed because most members of Congress are in bed with the gun lobbyists. Getting rid of these politicians is another whole story of how broken our system is.
