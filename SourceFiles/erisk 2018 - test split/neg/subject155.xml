<TEXT> Grey tree frogs laid eggs a few weeks ago in buckets of water we have outdoors. Two of the buckets were long established with pond water and aquatic plants so I felt confident leaving those eggs alone. One of the buckets had just been filled with tap water the day before and was devoid of plant life so I decided to bring those eggs inside to raise. Here are the 60 healthy tadpoles from that clutch, which will soon be developing legs. They are fed every two days with boiled kale and a small supplement of spinach, and occasionally algae when we're able to cultivate some. The tadpoles left outdoors did not fare so well, however. They remained small for weeks and then began disappearing until eventually they were all gone. During that time we found a second clutch of eggs had been left in one of the buckets. I moved those to a new container in a different part of the yard, freshly filled and planted, and those tadpoles are healthy and growing fast. There are about 100 and I feed them the same diet as those indoors. Yesterday a third clutch of eggs was left. I moved almost all of them inside to a 30 gallon container. I count 130 and they are already beginning to develop. The last time I raised tadpoles every one emerged healthy from the water and I hope to replicate that success with these. </TEXT>

Channels that have names beginning with #mp3 are likely to be file sharing channels. In the channel there are users running file sharing scripts. Typically you would type *@username* to receive that user's file list. The text file they send will have a list of all the files available and instructions on how to request them. You can also search for something specific by typing *@find term* in the channel. </TEXT>

Religion is a very powerful influence on cultural development though. It inspires the laws and the moral codes, and the fundamental existential philosophies of peoples. It is no easy task to separate religion from culture, and by extension the way a culture governs itself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gay marriage. In the 1990s and early 2000s it was very unpopular and I agreed with the prevailing argument being made that it was unbiblical for a marriage to be made between two people of the same sex. I did approve of an equal legal partnership using a name other than marriage, and that seemed to be the way things were headed at the time.

After giving the issue much thought, I realized that in most cases marriage is separate from religion. You can be married in a church yet not be recognized by the government, and you can be married by the government yet not recognized by a church. They are two different things. Given that separation I became a supporter of gay marriage and got married myself. I still believe that countries which have a religion based government should maintain their strict marriage rules, but in countries with secular governments like the United States there is no excuse not to marry same sex couples. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Texas, which may be worse than the US in general. The way the trial was handled was very one-sided. The prosecutor was manipulative, using a lot of theatrics in front of the jury, going from a soft, calm voice to violent screaming, yelling disparaging remarks at family members in the gallery, bringing up the unrelated rape history of family members in the gallery and questioning their mental health as a result of their experiences, singing lullabies to frame the innocence of a child, etc etc. We had to remain silent and endure the things she was saying. She brought in expert after expert, all friends of hers, who happily admitted to being incompetent in their job of keeping track of people who are released on probation as justification for imposing a long sentence (the jury chooses the length of the sentence.) The defense was constantly shot down when they tried to make an argument or object. The judge did not allow any of the girl's history or her problems with the family and subsequent foster family to be mentioned. When the defendant attempted to bring it up the judge yelled at him and ordered the jury be removed from the room.

The jury spent many hours deliberating and was deadlocked. The judge quite forcefully instructed them to reach a decision, telling them if they could not reach a verdict another jury would be selected and it wouldn't be any easier for those people. He was anxious to go home since it was late at night by that time. When they finally did come back and started rattling off a list of not guiltys the judge was visibly irritated. I do not know the justification for the guilty verdicts. It was obvious that some jury members were upset by the prosecutor and hanging on her every word, but it's not like there was evidence to support the charges. The only actual evidence presented was his piracy of copyrighted material, which I guess was intended to frame him as a criminal in the minds of the jury. Completely unrelated to the charges in the trial though. </TEXT>

She had a habit of making up lies about family members when she didn't get what she wanted, which apparently happened quite frequently. There was a situation, I think she wanted a boy to move into the house and her parents refused. She responded with an extensive list of serious allegations which could land someone in prison for life. The family is large and not a single person believed a word she said, however it ended up in court. The case left a sour taste in my mouth regarding the justice system here. </TEXT>

I would propose a synthetic virus, transmitted easily and able to spread across the world. Its purpose would be to reduce fertility. If we directly targeted hormone production we could also eliminate things like anger, which is a primary factor in crime and other antisocial behavior. The world could become a much more peaceful place in addition to lowering the population. There may be detrimental health effects though. It would require a great deal of study. </TEXT>

The story faded out for a while, although this week it was discussed some more on MSNBC.

<TEXT> The UN monitored Saddam destroying the Iraqi weapons and remained in the country to ensure no other stockpiles were hidden, before being chased out by US bombers without a chance to complete the job. I don't know how the media in the US framed it but in Europe we were shocked at the way the UN inspectors were treated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It doesn't seem like a logical concern to me. If we assume that a divine being created life, and life is an incredible experience, why shouldn't that same divine being be capable of creating an eternity which is also an incredible experience? With the ability to create and control anything, such a reality is possible. The idea that one could become bored in eternity implies that there is a flaw in the design of the experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From  Peter Schweizer's article,

 Bill and Hillary Clinton received large sums of money directly and indirectly from Russian officials while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.  Bill Clinton was paid a cool $500,000 (well above his normal fee) for a speech in Moscow in 2010.  Who footed the bill?  An investment firm in Moscow called Renaissance Capital, which boasts deep ties to Russian intelligence.  The Clinton Foundation itself took money from Russian officials and Putin-connected oligarchs.  They also took donations from:

    Viktor Vekselberg, a Putin confidant who gave through his company, Renova Group
     Andrey Vavilov, a former Russian government official who was Chairman of SuperOx, a research company that was part of the nuclear Cluster at the Russian governments Skolkovo research facility
     Elena Baturina, the wife of the former Mayor of Moscow, who apparently gave them money through JSC Inteco, an entity that she controls

 Then there is the glaring fact that the Clinton Foundation also scored $145 million in donations from nine shareholders in a Canadian uranium company called Uranium One that was sold to the Russian government in 2010. The deal required the approval of several federal government agencies, including Hillary Clintons State Department. The deal allowed Rosatom, the Russian State Nuclear Agency, to buy assets that amounted to 20 percent of American uranium.  Rosatom, by the way controls the Russian nuclear arsenal.

 Equally troubling: some of those donations were hidden and not disclosed by the Clintons. President Obama required the Clinton Foundation to disclose all contributions as a condition of Hillary Clinton becoming Secretary of State. But that did not happen. The only reason the hidden donations ever came to light is because we uncovered them by combing through Canadian tax records.

 Everyone got what they wanted in this deal: the uranium investors made a nice profit; the Russians acquired a strategic asset; and the Clinton Foundation bagged a lot of money.

 Hillary Clinton says she was not involved in the decision to approve the sale of Uranium One.  As proof, the Clinton campaign in 2015 trotted out her former aide, Assistant Secretary of State Fernandez, to say publicly that we should take his word for it that she was not involved in approving that deal. But as we now know from the leaked Podesta emails, Fernandez was all too eager to help Podesta kill the story, while getting other favors from Podesta.  That raises questions about the veracity of his comments. 

 It seems strange that while some in Congress are eager to investigate the activities of General Mike Flynn and his contacts with Russia, they have no interest in looking into a transaction in which the Clinton Foundation received a staggering $145 million. Its that kind of inconsistency that saps all credibility from those raising these issues.

 Beyond the Clintons themselves, there is also the troubling case of one of their closest aides, John Podesta. He served as Hillary Clintons 2016 campaign chairman. Podesta didnt just have conversations with Russian officials. He went into business with the Russian government while he was advising Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State.

 In 2011, John Podesta joined the executive board of a small energy company called Joule Unlimited.  Two months after he joined the board, the Russian government invested one billion rubles (approximately $35 million) into the company. The money came from a Russian government investment fund called Rusnano. What is Rusnano? It is a fund started in 2007 by Vladimir Putin and has been described by Russian Education and Science Minister Andrei Fursenko as Putins Child.

 According to State Department cables leaked via Wikileaks, technology venture funds like Rusnano were considered a national security concern by U.S. officials because they could serve a dual use in their investments. That is, their investments in civilian technologies could have a military application.

 In short, John Podesta was business partners with the Russian government and Vladimir Putin.  When John Podesta went to the White House in January 2014 to serve as counselor to President Obama, he failed to disclose his board membership in one of the Joule entities on his financial disclosure form. According to the Podesta emails, Podesta transferred his 75,000 shares in the company to an LLC controlled by his family. But as the Wall Street Journal notes, the Podesta emails reveal he remained actively engaged in company business after that fact. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as making pizza at home goes, if you like New York crust buy some All Trumps flour and proof the dough for a couple of days, then cook it on a regular aluminum pizza tray near the bottom of the oven. Grande Mozzarella is quite popular in pizza restaurants and can be found in some delis or ordered online from Pennmac. Sauce is easy enough - Cento crushed tomatoes plus some seasoning, maybe precooked.

If it's Chicago deep dish you like, I experimented with that the other day and it turned out nearly perfect the first time. I used 13% bread flour and a ton of yeast and vegetable oil, then rolled the dough out and layered it in a cast iron skillet and baked at 400. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's used in places like Canada. You're given points for things like having a skill, and if you have enough points you're approved to immigrate. Personally I don't think it's suitable for this country because the United States is literally a nation of immigrants. It's unique in the world (with the possible exception of Israel) and shouldn't be too selective with immigration. We want people from everywhere, including the third world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Iphones will cost what the market will bear. They cost a few dozen dollars to make, the company spends a lot of money on advertising, and then sells the product at a huge mark up. Even if the cost of production tripled Apple would make a major profit by keeping the price the same. Apple is a niche brand. It's not a market leader, yet it has more cash on hand than virtually anyone else. Think about that. </TEXT>

He is more popular with Republican voters than virtually anyone else. 9 in 10 Republican voters support him, and the number is growing. The party can't ask its voters to take sides because Trump will win that every time. It's a positive thing because the Republican party itself wants to do some truly terrible things to the country and it can't while Trump is the one with the pen. They have to do things his way, and his way is better for the American people. </TEXT>

From past information I've read the percentage of non-citizens who vote is somewhere close to 10%. When I came to this country my lawyer mentioned the not voting thing to me but I could imagine many people who did not have the benefit of a lawyer might not understand that they are not supposed to vote until they become citizens.

Citizens must be protected too of course. A citizen, even one who has served time in prison, must be permitted to cast a vote, and their ID would be their ticket to entry into the polling booth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What proponents of illegal immigration are defending is little better than slavery. A separate class of people to be exploited, working for little to no compensation depending on their situation, unequal in society, without any of the protections enjoyed by legals, at constant threat of being turned in to the authorities if they fail to work hard enough. And this idea of 'trickle up' simply doesn't work. Importing more and more people at ever lower pay doesn't cause everyone else to move up the economic ladder, it puts those at the bottom out of work and onto welfare (if welfare exists.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a political science behind presidential elections. It's very hard for an incumbent to be defeated, and it's very hard for a party to hold onto power for two leaders in succession.

The president of Ipsos wrote a compelling article about it.

http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2015/10/14/forget-what-you-saw-last-night-two-simple-reasons-a-republican-is-likely-to-win-in-2016/

At the moment it looks like Trump's first term is going similarly to that of Bill Clinton, who started with an approval rating of 55% and sunk quickly to 37% before beginning to climb again. Trump is currently on the upswing from a similar dip.

<TEXT> Most do not agree with personal attacks on twitter, however those are remarks against individual people, not broadly sexist or racist or xenophobic. The reason people support Trump is because during the ~ 18 month presidential campaign he visited communities all over the country and listened to the concerns of the people, and incorporated solutions to those problems into his platform. Now that he's president he's fulfilling the campaign promises he made. He's doing what he said he would do, and he said he would do those things because the people of the country told him those things were a problem. Not everyone is going to approve, and not everyone is going to be affected by the issues or see them as a problem, but a broad swath of the country does. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He talks about various things on a regular basis that mostly don't make it to articles, just clips end up on youtube.

 I think its politics more than anything else, says former House of Representatives Member Ron Raul (R-TX) regarding calls for an investigation of purported hacking by the Russian government influencing the United States presidential election. Interviewed Wednesday on Fox Business, Paul continues that, even if Russia did what is alleged, Paul does not think it made any difference.

 Paul  providing perspective on the matter  notes that the US government is interfering with elections around the world all the time. Paul also suggests reviewing the history of US government involvement in foreign countries, including how many countries we invaded, how many people we have killed in order to have our guy in. Looking to this history, Paul concludes, we dont have much room for condemning anybody else. </TEXT>

For many years, whenever he hears about or reads about someone who is suffering in some way he attempts to help them, financially, legally, or through his connections, getting them a job. In his every day life, giving generous and life changing tips to those in the service industry who do not have good incomes, calling attention to those who deserve appreciation for what they do. The opposite of narcissism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think deep down love is a universal. How you feel about your parents and siblings and pets, even an old friend, that's love, and it's the same love you have for a spouse. It's familiarity. It means you're part of each other's life and you want it to remain that way forever. The actual romantic feelings, the joy and exhilaration of being together, I think is something other than love. Love is the belonging together part. Romance is a separate layer. </TEXT>

You have to destroy the massive health insurance companies since they will be redundant, beat the medical suppliers into submission to get equipment at a fair price, cut doctor salaries by half, give the pharmaceutical companies an ultimatum to provide affordable drugs or else the drugs will be purchased from India in generic form, and many other steps to bring down costs. Whoever takes on such a challenge will also have a permanent target on their back and face constant slander in an attempt to alienate them, since politicians in both parties have a cosy and profitable relationship with the lobbyists. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Affordable" is a joke. Before Obamacare was forced upon us I could just about afford health insurance at $100 per month. Obamacare put an end to that and now the cheapest plans available are $300, way outside my price range. I seriously doubt that there are more people with insurance now than before. Sure, those with pre-existing conditions were finally able to buy insurance and that no doubt encompassed a sizeable number of people, but how many millions lost insurance because the cost of buying it doubled? Most Americans live paycheck to paycheck. No way can they find the money to pay twice as much as before. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a lot more complicated than that. Many countries in the world have proud histories of conquest, invention, innovation, arts, literature, philosophy. Thousands of years of uniqueness to take pride in, particularly if they've contributed things which have influenced the entire world, such as the philosophy of democracy. Immigration naturally begins to diversity a population and over time fewer and fewer people feel connected to their nation's history. It is like a species becoming endangered after having survived many eras on the Earth, only a shadow of its former glory. The nation remains but many of the people living there no longer have a connection to the past or feel the spirit that led to the great accomplishments. There are even attempts to make people feel shame for their nation's past triumphs, as if to discourage the thinking which allowed that culture to prosper and progress.

The United States is a nation of immigrants. That is what defines the American philosophy and what gives it its greatness. For other nations, however, immigration has almost the opposite impact. </TEXT>

They're brainwashing people (mostly liberals) into seeing Trump as a bad guy and the political establishment as the good guys. So long as enough of us refuse to buy into propaganda we will remain a free society, but some ugly times in history have started out the same way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is my system using its full potential?

I built my new computer a couple of weeks ago using 6700K CPU and 1070 GPU. The parts website suggested the system would pull 110W-389W, so I chose a 650W PSU to be safe. Instead the system only uses 30W most of the time, and maybe 130W during high performance tasks.

I've run benchmarks and they say the components are delivering the expected high scores, and games run perfectly, but it seems odd that such little power is being consumed. Did I misread the power estimates and 110W is actually the estimated wattage under load? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Screwing up established history is worse than continuing the existing narrative. TNG/DS9/VOY were popular shows that shared a common time period. They could continue from there, or advance a few decades. What made those shows popular is that they were a calm, uplifting look at a fictional future in which all of the world's problems have been solved and now people are out exploring the mysteries of space. They inspired real changes in attitudes, new technologies and scientific theories. The more recent stories are just copying things that already exist now in an attempt to seem cool and cutting edge. No one cares about a gay or transgendered crew member. We want to be inspired about the distant future. </TEXT>

 "I just spoke with both Silverstone and APC. Silverstone is going to get back to me on this question, but APC was pretty clear -- they strongly felt that PFC power supplies should use true sine wave UPSs. They told me that the reason for this was because PFC power supplies require a much faster changeover time when the battery kicks in, and that due to the design of stepped sine wave UPSs, they were not always fast enough to satisfy the power supply. This could lead to the PSU shutting down when the battery tried to kick in. The guy I spoke with said that the stepped sine wave wouldn't "damage" the PSU, but that it simply might not work, and that if it DID work, it might not "always" work. Apparently it depends on the specific power supply." </TEXT>

<TEXT>  So if a court can prove that you incite imminent lawlessness by falsely shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, it can convict you. If you incite an unlawful riot, your speech is "brigaded" with illegal action, and you will have broken the law. But merely falsely shouting "fire" does not break the law, even if it risks others safety.


It sounds like the first amendment does not protect speech which causes a panic and leads to lawless action. Presumably this applies to the press also. </TEXT>

Rosie O'Donnell called him an idiot and said he should have stripped Tara of her title, and then made further insults against Trump's family. That's what this long feud is about. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In the spring I noticed wasps building a nest by the door of my house. It has happened in previous years and I leave them alone because they never bother me and seem to recognize that I'm not a threat to them. This year the nest is growing larger than normal with about 200 cells and a third of those are white. There are 10 wasps sitting on it and there are now several smaller nests close to it. I'm not sure if it's appropriate to let it continue to grow.

Will they eventually abandon it? If not, is there something humane I can do to encourage them to leave while allowing the remaining cells to hatch?

The location is Texas and they look like paper wasps. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Philosophical question. In your opinion did Bill Clinton rape Monica Lewinsky? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-04 23:02:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This question was recently raised in the media and I thought it would be insightful to hear a range of opinions. Monica Lewinsky has of course stated many times that the relationship she had with then-president Bill Clinton was consensual on her part, however we know that even if a victim consents it is not necessarily legal. Children and the mentally disadvantaged are not able to reliably consent, for example.

Relationships between employers and employees are controversial because it is unclear exactly how much power the employee has to consent. The employer holds a degree of power over them and the employee is risking their job and reputation if they say no, which can be seen as coercion whether on a conscious or subconscious level. Even if they approve of the relationship it could be argued that they did not have the ability to fairly consent, and it turns out there is a scholarly debate over whether Monica Lewinsky was the victim of rape.

Bill Clinton was her superior in several ways. He was more than twice her age, her boss, and the president of her country. Those three things gave him enormous power over her.

What is your opinion, and would you feel the same way in that scenario? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Do frogs help tadpoles to leave the water? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-13 07:12:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A few weeks ago I acquired some grey tree frog tadpoles and have been raising them to keep in a terrarium. A couple of them have already turned to frogs and are doing well, looking and behaving very differently from their tadpole life.

Today I had a couple of tadpoles which are close to leaving the water. They have four strong legs and have turned green in color, so I moved them to the large water dish in the terrarium so they can climb out when they're ready.

One of the frogs saw this and hopped all the way across the terrarium and started looking down into the water. It then crawled down to the dish and lowered itself into the water, holding on to the edge and facing up, and stayed like this for ten minutes. A few hours later the other frog noticed the tadpoles and did exactly the same thing, first observing and then climbing into the water. Other than this they haven't shown any interest in the water before.

Are the frogs trying to guide the tadpoles out of the water? </TEXT>

It seems that every country diplomatically recognizes only one China and refuses to recognize the other. Why are there no countries which recognize them both? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-03-24 21:09:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I keep reading it, even hearing people here in Houston complain about it. No it isn't. Oil is not cheap. I was alive 15 years ago. I remember the way things are supposed to be. I remember how much things are supposed to cost.

15 years ago oil was $30 a barrel, the same relative price it had been for decades. $30 a barrel is the price that oil settles at, the price that works. Then in 2003 the US invaded Iraq and it caused a massive spike in oil prices. Oil jumped from $30 a barrel to $140. It was chaos. It affected every area of the economy and prices doubled almost overnight. Travel costs doubled as airlines tacked hundreds of dollars onto the price of tickets, calling it a "fuel surcharge". The cost of food doubled because of the increased cost of transportation. It caused misery for everyone. Millions of people were pushed out of the middle class and into poverty because they now had to pay double what they were paying before. The only hope we had to cling to was the knowledge that eventually things would settle down and oil would return to a normal price, and the other prices would eventually follow.

Finally it's happening. Oil is falling, but it's still high. It's still over $40 a barrel. This is still an inflated price and it's still too much. It's moving in the right direction, but it most certainly is not cheap. Until it hits $30 we are still paying too much. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Plumber wants to replace my water heater with a Rheem </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-12 06:58:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have an A O Smith water heater which was most likely installed when my house was built in 2001. I've been very happy with it for the two years I've lived here - the water is always hot and it costs less than $10 a month in gas to run it. Unfortunately it's leaking and needs to be replaced. The plumber wants to put in a Rheem, and insists it's the most reliable brand they see. It's the only brand they install.

Is Rheem a good and reliable brand?

He also said the life expectancy would be 6 - 8 years. That seems quite short. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I moved to the US almost two years ago and my contact lens prescription is now out of date. I thought Walmart's vision center would be a cheap place to get a prescription, but they told me it would cost $125! That seems outrageously expensive for a simple eye test. Are there cheaper options I should be aware of? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Budget steadicam/stabilizer? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-09 09:56:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently purchased a Canon t3i to replace an older DSLR and would like to get more familiar with using it for video. It seems that handheld video is not very graceful and stabilization would help a lot. I'm a college student so finding a good price is important, and I'm only shooting video casually and experimenting so there's no need for professional equipment.

I found a few budget options and was wondering if anyone is familiar with them.

First is the [Sutefoto S40 Pro 40cm](http://www.amazon.com/SUTEFOTO-Portable-Handheld-Stabilizer-Panasonic/dp/B00P92DLQO/) **($72)** This seems to be identical to the unbranded S40 items on ebay so I'm assuming they are the same product. Amazon's price is lowest.

Next is the [Neewer Carbon Fiber 69cm](http://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Handheld-Stabilizer-Release-Weights/dp/B00P760R32/) **($80)** A familiar name in budget photography equipment.

I also found the [Flycam Junior](http://www.amazon.com/FLYCAM-Junior-Camera-Stabilizer-FLCM-JR/dp/B00IVJAE4O/) **($100)** This is available on ebay for $70 + $30 shipping, so $100 total. A little more expensive but I think it is a more familiar name in stabilization.

These are all a little more money than I'd envisioned. I know that professional equipment can be a lot more expensive still though. How well do these consumer level products perform? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Refilling ink cartridges </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-08 09:52:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I moved to the US last year for college and needed a cheap printer for homework. I normally do a lot of research before I buy things but in this case that wasn't too important. I picked up an HP 3511 at Walmart for about $30, very affordable and it's also a scanner and copier, wireless (which is a big plus). It's been just fine for the past year, churning out tons of pages.

After about a year it was time to replace the black ink and there were a few options. I decided to get a generic cartridge on ebay for $10 and that worked fine. Although there are chips on the cartridges the printer doesn't seem to care about using old cartridges. It just asks if you bought an authentic cartridge and you say no. When the color levels started to get low I looked into ink refilling. I bought a 'starter' kit on ebay for $7.50, which contained 30ml of each color ink and four syringes. I was very surprised to read that the ink cartridges only contain a few ml of ink, so this refill kit will actually refill the color cartridge about six times. Refilling was very quick and easy, just locate the filling hole and gently syringe the ink into the cartridge.

Until recently I've considered laser printers to be the best value for money, but now I think refilled inkjet cartridges are probably even better value. I've seen entire liters of ink available for $10 on ebay, enough to refill a black cartridge 125 times. Who knew. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Excluding the Airbus A380, which I've heard is already quieter. I've traveled on a lot of planes, and every time the experience has been insanely loud. Having a conversation with the person in the next seat is difficult, and communicating with someone in the aisle involves shouting or gesturing. It's like trying to communicate underwater. In recent years a lot of people have started to wear noise cancelling headphones on flights, but it seems like this problem could have be solved by placing microphones in the cabin and cancelling out the noise through the speaker system. Why isn't this done? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Which Walmart mountain bike would be best for me? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-20 06:33:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **UPDATE: I ended up buying a used bike from Craigslist as suggested and will be taking it to a shop shortly to see what tune ups are needed. I've left the original post below for the benefit of others who might have a similar query.**


*I've barely ridden a bike since I was a kid, but now I'd like to ride for exercise and to explore the area. I would mostly ride around the streets, parks, and woodland paths, nothing challenging. I live in Houston where it's very flat.*

*I'm 6' tall and probably weigh around 240lb, leg length 34".*

*I can't afford to spend too much, preferably under $150. There are a couple of bikes I've seen on the Walmart website which interested me.*

*The 26" Roadmaster Granite Peak is $80 and has many positive remarks around the internet.
http://www.walmart.com/ip/Roadmaster-Granite-Peak-26-Men-s-Mountain-Bike-Black/34931885*

*The 29" Genesis GS29 is $150 and has fewer reviews
http://www.walmart.com/ip/29-Genesis-Men-s-GS29-Bike/34116311*

*I had an opportunity to briefly see these bikes in Walmart, and to me the Roadmaster looks very small but sturdy, while the Genesis looks somewhat cheaply constructed but a more suitable size.*

*Can anyone offer some advice on what might be best for me, or have a better suggestion considering my limited budget?* </TEXT>

<TITLE> Non-smoker considering nicotine patches to aid with ADD, anxiety and depression </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-19 15:01:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently read that nicotine may help to improve mood in those suffering with depression, and may help to overcome some of the debilitating effects of anxiety and ADD.

As a non-smoker, I am curious about trying it for myself, a controversial decision, but the negative effects of those conditions affect the quality of life and may justify unusual steps. What risks are associated with nicotine patches? Can they be detrimental to health over a period of time?

About me, I'm 30, overweight and have high blood pressure. I am not on any medications. </TEXT>
