<TEXT> AMC is working on an ad-free subscription video service that would be exclusively available to cable TV customers. In other words, itd be a paid service that would be separate from your normal cable bill but require a cable account to even sign up for.

Youd pay extra  between $4.99 to $6.99 per month (AMC is still finalizing pricing)  on top of your TV bill to get ad-free streaming from whatever this AMC app is. 

No thank you AMC. </TEXT>

Been having this issue for the last week with my Nexus 6 running 7.1.1 on 4g. If I switch to 3g zero issues.

Have had no issues since I switched to Cricket over the summer till this past week.

Just now I thought I'd give a VPN a chance. Switched back to 4G. Lost Google Play connectivity. Switched back to 3G. Got access again. Installed PIA from the Play Store. Switched back to 4G lost Google Play services. Turned on VPN. Google Play came back. </TEXT>

You need to be root to delete the system apps as far as I know to then be able to save changes to your build.prop file.

If you have instructions or proof that you can do it without root I'm sure the OP would appreciate it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This should be your episode order 

https://thetvdb.com/?tab=seasonall id=80009 lid=7

The first OVS series came out in 1992. The second in 1994.
The third didn't come out till 2003. And when that happened they changed the name of the shoe around. It had different voice actors. 

If you use the episode numbers and title from the link if should all work for you.

FYI there are also a quite a few other Tenchi shows and movies

<TEXT> Not to be a dick. But you both make 65k Australian dollars a year? That's just about 50k US dollars. Only one income seems totally livable to me. Maybe look into budgeting better? 

With a joint income of 130k Australian dollars (98k US dollars) I'm not sure how you aren't saving to go live with your business.

Seriously speak with a financial consultant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The card you're using. Have you ever had a different address with that company. Say 5 years ago you were living somewhere else and had the same bank or credit card company.

Have you spoken with someone at your credit/debit card company? If so and they say that the address is correct have them check all their systems. They have multiple systems and one of them could have an older address. It's a pain for them to check so they'll probably just check the first part and say it matches. This is sort of more common (but still rare) with debit cards more so than credit cards. For example say you have a Bank of America debit card with a MasterCard branding on it. The Bank of America system will have your correct address. But the system they update with MasterCard could have your old address.

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like it. It works. Don't have to fiddle with things in my spare time.

I put Windows 10 (Windows 10 passed the activation test which I found surprising) on it for a week and got way way better graphics in Dying Light, Alien Isolation and Tomb Raider. But put Steam OS back on and beat them under Linux. Didn't really mind the dip in graphics that much.

Rocket League plays beautifully under Steam OS.

I have the cheapest i3 version but was contemplating buying a i7 CPU and upgrading the RAM on it.

This has decent reviews for coax to Ethernet. No idea personally if it's any good.

If any of the coax lines are straight shots or not to tricky I'd just tie Cat6 cables to it and pull it through the walls. Totally understand if you can't. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you running Plex Media Server on the Seagate Personal Cloud itself?
From a brief Google search it appears that the Seagate Personal Cloud NAS doesn't have the processing power to be able to transcode videos. It'll only be able to stream the original file. Which would then be up to the client what they can play natively.
Which is why your computer was able to play videos better than the Roku.

I'd recommend:

Using Seagate Personal Cloud as just a NAS. Store your video files there.

Connect your PC via Ethernet and install Plex Media Server on it. 
Depending on your passmark score (https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201774043-What-kind-of-CPU-do-I-need-for-my-Server-) of your computer I'm betting you'll be able to stream to your Roku and Android box with no issues.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's totally not one of the Street Fighter movies. 
Way more recent than those.

Sonny Chiba was not in the one I'm thinking of.

And if I remember correctly Street Fighter was a tad on the gorey side?
This was more like non lethal fighting. Kind of like Tokyo Raiders in the light heartedness.
If that makes any sense.

Thanks for the reply though! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not sure exactly when this Asian movie was made. Mid 90's early 2000's. But I think the absolute latest it could have been released would have been 2004.

 nbsp;

I think the English name of the movie was 2 words long.

 nbsp;

I "think" I had it on an **English dubbed VCD** (don't think I was ever able to track down a non-dubbed version).

Probably from ACF.

 nbsp;

I think the main character was a cop who was undercover.
I remember the main character being a little stocky.

 nbsp;

The one scene I remember was during the rain with a parked car. You could see the **rain hit the windshield in slow motion.** Possibly a kid was in the car? Some sort of **outside sidewalk steps** were in the background? Maybe there was a fight involving an umbrella? The scene had some sort of song playing while it happened. Fit very well in the scene.


Another scene later involved a fight at a warehouse. Possibly the last scene of the movie?

 nbsp;

I've spent hours reviewing movies and actors on Wikipedia, IMDB, loveKFFilm, HKMDB and yesasia and I'm unable to find out what it's called.

 nbsp;

Full Asian cast. Not a Hollywood movie.

 nbsp;

Actor's **NOT** in the movie:

Jet Li

Jackie Chan

Sammo Hung

Takeshi Kitano

Stephen Chow


I really want to say Chow Yun-fat is not in it. But when I browsed his Wikipedia page he was wearing a 
baseball hat. Which reminded me that the lead may have wore one and might have slightly looked like Chow Yun-fat. Reviewing his filmography nothing jumps out at me. And the time table of when the movie was probably made he was to big of a star to be in this.
**Is there a chubby/stocky actor that resembles Chow Yun-fat?**

 nbsp;

I don't remember guns being used. Maybe a baseball bat?
I think the movie was kind of humorous. Not Stephen Chow funny. But way less serious than Infernal Affairs.

 nbsp;

I think the lead wore **overalls** in one scene? Maybe the final one in a warehouse? And had a baseball bat, hat and a silly grin?
Maybe even the lead may have wore **overalls** the entire film?

 nbsp;

I wouldn't be surprised if this movie did not have an English Wikipedia page. Why? I've spent hours reviewing Asian actors/directors Wikipedia filmography pages and can't seem to find it. And it was far from a blockbuster budget film.

 nbsp;

It is **NOT** a sports movie.

It is **NOT** a Takashi Miike film

 nbsp;

The movie is **NOT:**

City on Fire

Infernal Affairs

Tiger On The Beat

Street Fighter (from the 70's)

 nbsp;

<TEXT> You could use a HDMI splitter and have 1 Roku provide service for 2 (or more) TV's.

So whatever you have on TV 1 would be the same thing that is on TV 2.

I do that between my living room and my kitchen. That way if I get up to make a drink or grab a snack I don't have to pause the movie.

Probably won't work in larger households where multiple people want to watch different things. Just an idea though. </TEXT>

You could add the Unwatched filter before you create the playlist to limit down to episodes you've not watched.

Why do you only want X amount of episodes in your playlist?

If you want more manual control instead of a doing step 13 of my guide you could pick the episodes and add them individually to a playlist. You would do that by mousing over each episode. Select the 3 dots ... and then select Add to Playlist... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been a Netflix subscriber for years. Back before instant was even available. Then when instant came out you got both for free. Canceled the disk subscription part when they split instant off effectively doubling the price of what I was paying. Plus they were throttling mailing disks out if you mailed them back to fast.

It is still a great value to get them mailed to you. Especially since it's rare to even come across a video store nowadays. But instant has more than I need now.

You might also want to check out your local library. You might be surprised at how many Blu-rays they have to rent. Maybe even free.

FYI

Rule 3 of this subreddit:

This subreddit is for Netflix instant watch only (All regions instant watch is available are welcome to post. Just make sure you use the correct regional tag in the title.). Please redirect items only available for disc to/r/netflix.

If you're looking for some good movies to get mailed out you might want to subscribe to that subreddit as well. </TEXT>

I set aiming to arrow up, down, left and right. But even though those keys were set pressing the keys did nothing. Maybe it's a bug?

No clue. Been trying to do all my purchases actually on my Steam Machine. I think that helps out the developers/porters making money off a Linux/SteamOS sale.

Huge freaking oversight IMO. Also doesn't appear that Big Picture mode on other operating systems supports ratings nor writing reviews. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used the health app in the past. Didn't like it. Would think bike rides were actually walks. I disabled it and just used Google Fit and that's worked flawlessly.

I don't wear my watch when I sleep and it would always give me wacky sleep results due to that. 

Now pressing the up button pops up a message asking me to turn on Pebble Health. I do not want to turn it on.

Is there a way the button can be useful again? Maybe by seeing my past Timeline? Or have 1 press of the button open an app of my choice like how long press works?
If not is there a way I can roll back the update to the previous version 3? </TEXT>

<TEXT> What version of Android are you running?

Do you have other apps running. Try closing those and only have Pokmon Go running.

How stong is your cell service when you're playing? Are you on 4G, 3G or is it bouncing back and forth?

I'd also recommend uninstalling Snapchat like the other people have mentioned. 

How high is your brightness when you're playing? 

Maybe turning AR off in the game?

I got at least 2 hours of Pokmon Go in the other day and I started with around 50 battery. </TEXT>

<TITLE> SteamOS output log file locations? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-29 21:59:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm having an issue with a game on Steam. I've have been emailing the developer back and forth for a bit. They asked me

"Are you able to access output logs and send them to us? Seems to be Linux specific issue so we would need to take a closer look."

I'm not sure where those would be located at. I asked them what/where they are looking for but the turn around time for them getting back to me is about 24 hours. Was thinking maybe someone here could point me in the right direction so I could save a day of waiting. Getting conflicting info Googling where they would be located.

Thanks a lot!


EDIT:
And they were located at

~/.config/unity3d/PUBLISHERNAME/GAMENAME/FILEINEED.log

All caps words used as examples.

Thanks for all the replies everyone! </TEXT>

Maybe WiFi at location B that doesn't have a password on it? Or someone else knows the password and did the downloading?


Who is your ISP at location B?
I know if you have Comcast and use the default modem/router they allow any other Comcast customer's to login with their own Comcast login IDs and get online.


Doesn't sound like a Plex issue at all. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [TOMT][MOVIE] Asian film from late 90's early 00's </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-12 11:16:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think the main character was a cop who was undercover.

  
I remember the main character being a little stocky.


The one scene I remember was during the rain with a parked car. You could see the rain hit the windshield in slow motion. Possibly a kid was in the car? Some sort of outside sidewalk steps were in the background? Maybe there was a fight involving an umbrella? 
The scene had some sort of song playing while it happened. Fit very well in the scene.


Another scene later involved a fight at a warehouse. Possibly the last scene of the movie?


I think the English name of the movie was 2 words long.


Had it on an English dubbed VCD.


I'm not sure exactly when the movie was made. Late 90's early 2000's. But I think the absolute latest it could have been would have been 2004.  

Actor's NOT in the movie:


Jet Li

Jackie Chan

Sammo Hung

Takeshi Kitano


Worst description ever. Sorry. Thanks for any help!


Edit:

I don't remember guns being used. Maybe a baseball bat?

I think the movie was kind of humorous. Not Stephen Chow funny. But way less serious than Infernal Affairs.

Full Asian cast. Not a Hollywood movie. 

I really want to say Chow Yun-fat is not in it. But when I browsed his Wikipedia page he was wearing a baseball hat. Which reminded me that the lead may have wore one and might have slightly looked like Chow Yun-fat. Reviewing his filmography nothing jumps out at me. And the time table of when the movie was probably made he was to big of a star to be in this.

MOAR EDITS:

I think the lead wore **overalls** in one scene? Maybe the final one in a warehouse? And had a baseball bat, hat and a silly grin?

I think the lead may have wore **overalls** the entire film?

Not a sports movie!

Is there a chubby/stocky actor that resembles Chow Yun-fat?

I wouldn't be surprised if this movie did not have an English Wikipedia page. Why? I've spent hours reviewing Asian actors/directors Wikipedia filmography pages and can't seem to find it. And it was far from a blockbuster budget film. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was looking for WiFi Tether for Root Users by Mller, Lemons, Buxton. I used to use it all the time. Was amazing! I can't seem to find out what happened to it.

You used to be able to find it on the Play Store here:
https://web.archive.org/web/20120623083901/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.googlecode.android.wifi.tether

The project home was:
https://code.google.com/p/android-wifi-tether/

before Google shut down code.google.com

Anyone one know what happened to it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Having some ISP issues. Most likely won't be resolved till next week.
Everything on internal network is great.

I have 2 users setup under Plex Home:

MYSELF - lifetime Plex Pass Member
ROOMMATE - no account with Plex

Normally when you open the Roku app you are prompted to select a user. Its defaulting to the ROOMMATE account with no option to change users.

On the Plex Server itself when I try and launch Media Manager normally you should be prompted to select a user. Only MYSELF shows up and nothing happens when I try and select it.

Plex Home Theater only gives me the MYSELF login option and then no media will load. 

XBone and PS4 apps will not launch due to needing internet.

No media shows up on Android devices on (internal) WiFi network.

Any ideas how I can access my profile till ISP issue is resolved?

UPDATE:
Wasn't able to figure it out. ISP replaced cable box (outside) and internet is back. So no longer have the Plex issue untill the internet goes dark again :/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> Does Lenovo ship malware/spyware on tablets/phones?

After reading

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2wecz2/lenovo_users_report_preinstalled_superfish_adware/

earlier today I got to thinking maybe Im infected.

On Black Friday I purchased a Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 (10") running Android. 

Shortly after I received it Google Opinion Rewards started popping up with China related surveys. Such as what hotels I was familiar with in Hong Kong. How many more times do I plan on traveling to Hong Kong in the next year.

I thought it was funny and I was making those sweet sweet Google Play credits. 

Just assumed it was Google working some magic and nothing malicious.
Now after reading that article not so sure.

I factory reset the tablet today and did NOT sign in with my Google account. Saved some screenshots of the odd survey questions first.

Survey 1: http://i.imgur.com/xNhT3Ku.jpg

Survey 2: http://i.imgur.com/n7R5aLo.jpg

Anyways Ive got this tablet now which Im willing to see if it contains any malware. 

Just not very sure how to go about that 

Any ideas? 

Pinky promise Ill post back with anything I find out!



~~Sorry if this doesnt belong in /r/android. Though with todays news it seemed like it might be.
If it doesn't belong where do you recommend for good visibility?~~

Guess it didn't fit. Let's try /r/androidquestions

     

**UPDATE:**

I found this randomly

https://bluebox.com/technical/questioning-the-chain-of-trust-investigations-into-the-root-certificates-on-mobile-devices/

It  said
 The latest Android operating system, KitKat 4.4.4, ships with 156 pre-installed root CA certificates

I do only have 156 on my tablet. So that's a good sign.
Though that article does raise the point if you need all 156 of them installed.

Will look for more things on my end. Any tips would be appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Amazon and Netflix both have the remastered versions online. The updated special effects are odd. Is there anywhere legally I can watch the non remastered versions? If not are they available as extras on the Blu-ray set?




Thanks for taking the time to read this! 




*EDIT Amazon also has the originals listed. Just hadn't scrolled far enough over. Also the Blu-ray's have both versions. 


Thanks for your replies!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> USB nightly automated backup and compression solution wanted </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-03-20 02:57:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Nightly on a Windows Server 2008 (R2 Datacenter edition) I need to backup my E drive to a 32GB USB stick. Currently there is 33GB of data on the E drive so the data will need to be compressed. I've tried a few different solutions online and I can't find a reliable one that will

1) erase USB stick

2) compress and copy data.

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

EDIT:

I'm not looking for cloud storage. The server is offline.

I'm looking (of coarse) for a free or open source software that will do the trick. If there is a one time fee for the software that could possibly work. Monthly fees are not in the budget.

Buying larger USB sticks is also not in the budget. This is for a non profit organization and they have multiple servers at different locations with basically the same setup. Right now they use 2 x 32GB USB sticks which are used in rotation. They can't afford buying a bunch of 64GB sticks for all there locations.

<TEXT> I've been using Astraweb (with ssl) for years without any problem. In the past few months if you don't jump on something new it'll no longer be available (I'm assuming from takedown requests). In the last few weeks it's gotten ridiculously bad. Anyone recommend an alternative? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2012-09-26 05:42:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Does anyone know how I can burn a 4GB (and larger) mkv to a Dual Layer DVD (as a data disc) that will be readable by my jailborken/hacked/modded PS3 running custom firmware? I've tried playing DATA discs from Showtime (Which can play mkvs beautifully if they are smaller than 4GB from a USB stick) and it can't read the disc if it's over 4GB. Nor can MultiMan read the disc. Is there some weird format that I should burn them as? I know I can just FTP it over but it's a pain on my end to do that. I also know I can split the file to fit on USB drive. But what I want to do is to burn the DATA discs so I can just pop one in in the future. I don't have the storage capacity nor the fiances to just run a dedicated server running Plex or PS3MediaServer to stream all my video files over. I've Googled it a few times and haven't had much luck.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

EDIT: Updated post with further clarification. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just got a promotional email from Roku. Anyone who purchases a Roku through it saves 5 bucks. And I get $4 Amazon video credit. Yeah yeah it seems like I'm spamming Reddit . BUT maybe someone is in the market for a Roku and would like to save 5 USofA unit of monies. OR other Roku owners might like to know about the promotion so they can tell their friends and get some Amazon video credit for themselves.
