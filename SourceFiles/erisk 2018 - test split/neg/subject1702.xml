<TEXT> WASHINGTON (AP)  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell fended off criticism Tuesday that a working group of Republican senators hes asked to craft a health care bill lacks women, saying all 52 GOP senators were shaping the legislation.

The all-male makeup of the 13-member group was clearly an irritant among some of the chambers five GOP women. It also became a target for Democrats eager to paint the evolving Republican legislation as a measure thats damaging to women needing medical care, even as key decisions are being made by men.


Thats really up to the leadership, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the longest-serving female GOP senator in her 21st year in the chamber, said of the groups lack of women. It seems to me theyve already made their decision. The panel has apparently been meeting for some time, and Im not a member of it.

Asked about the group, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said, I just want to make sure we have some women on it.

We know it makes a difference when women are in the room, and we know it makes a difference when women arent in the room on what is brought up, how its seen and how its put together, said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the No. 3 Senate Democratic leader.

GOP efforts to repeal former President Barack Obamas health care law have shifted to the Senate, five days after Republicans pushed a version of the legislation through the House.

GOP senators have made clear they will likely make substantial changes in the House bill. Some have criticized that measures cuts in the Medicaid program for poor and disabled people, the federal subsidies that would leave many consumers with higher out-of-pocket costs and the estimated 24 million people whod lose coverage.

The 13 senators McConnell appointed to the informal group include himself and other party leaders and committee chairmen, conservative mavericks, lawmakers from states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and others.

Facing solid Democratic opposition and controlling the Senate 52-48, Republicans can lose only two GOP senators votes but prevail with Vice President Mike Pence breaking a 50-50 tie. McConnell said all GOP senators are meeting daily and discussing the health care effort.

The working group that counts is all 52 of us, and were having extensive meetings daily, said McConnell, R-Ky. Nobodys being excluded based on gender.

Pressed by reporters, McConnell added, You need to write about whats actually happening, and were having extensive discussions about the real issues. Everybodys at the table.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer distanced the Trump administration from the groups membership.

I think the more voices that we can put on a panel to help get this done, the better. So, to the extent  Im not going to tell Leader McConnell or the White House is not going to tell him how to conduct a panel, Spicer said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the House bill is so discriminatory against women. He cited a provision that could let insurers levy higher premiums on some people with pre-existing medical conditions, which in the past has included pregnancy.

Its a very, very bad thing to exclude women from the working group. Theyre more than half the population.

One of the Senates most moderate Republicans, Collins, 64, has at times been a problem for party leaders, such as opposing a cutoff of federal payments to Planned Parenthood. Shes viewed as one who might vote against the GOP bill.

Collins is the 15th longest-serving current senator and hasnt missed a roll call vote since entering the chamber, a streak her office says reached 6,352 votes Tuesday.

Collins told reporters that GOP women senators are not afraid to make their voices heard and said she was not worried they would have no input. She said shes working with Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., on an alternative health care overhaul and with other senators on how to revamp Medicaid.

She said shed spent 15 minutes at Tuesdays Senate GOP lunch describing a high-risk pool Maine uses to help cover costs for people with serious diseases who are expensive to treat. She said to replicate Maines program nationally would cost $15 billion yearly, which I do not see in the House bill.

Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., said she was unconcerned about the panels roster, saying, Every senator has their say.

The working group met Tuesday and members said they discussed how to handle the Houses plan to phase out the current laws expansion of Medicaid to more low earners.

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., whos criticized those Medicaid cuts, attended the private meeting, senators said. Her state is among the 31 that has accepted additional money to expand Medicaid. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Goldblum from [Ew.com:](http://ew.com/tv/2017/05/08/jeff-goldblum-jurassic-world-national-geographic-explorer-thor/)




Even though some might say its popcorn-y entertainment (top-notch, of course), in our conversation he was very focused on the serious issues of greed as it oftentimes comes up in those movies, and the marvels of science and reason and the very fascinating point at which our species finds itself both in real life and in this imaginary world too. Im very interested in that myself, so Im looking forward to this. Ive got a few things to do. Im nothing if not conscientious, so Im enjoying working on it every day.

Off I go in a few weeks to London, where theyve been hard at work, and Ill try to contribute something to the plate of dino-entertainment. I like my character. I think my character is a saucy, sassy man of some integrity and deep thinking. And of course, that whole world continues to be popular, slam-bang, top entertainment. I talked to the director, J.A. Bayona, over the phone. I enjoyed his movie The Impossible with Naomi Watts, and hes something else. I didnt realize he was a good friend of a friend of mine, a director I worked with a while ago in Spain named Fernando Trueba, whos just fantastic. Knowing that the two of them are brethren and brotherly in their friendship makes me feel very good, too. </TEXT>

 Rep. Maloney is calling on other Democrats to do the same, and at least one other member of congress is trying this, in Arizona, where Rep.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)  Being a communist would no longer be a fireable offense for California government employees under a bill passed Monday by the state Assembly.

Lawmakers narrowly approved the bill to repeal part of a law enacted during the Red Scare of the 1940s and 50s when fear that communists were trying to infiltrate and overthrow the U.S. government was rampant. The bill now goes to the Senate.


It would eliminate part of the law that allows public employees to be fired for being a member of the Communist Party.

<TEXT> From Variety.com:

The presidents of the Writers Guild of America East and West said that FCC Chairman Ajit Pais plans to review a Stephen Colbert joke about Donald Trump was an indication of the administrations **"willful disregard of the First Amendment.**


A week ago, on his CBS show, Colbert quipped during his opening monologue that the only thing [Trumps] mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putins c holster. Colberts mouth was blurred and the term was bleeped out for the broadcast, however.

In an interview with a Philadelphia radio station on Friday, Pai said that **"I have had a chance to see the clip now and so, as we get complaints  and weve gotten a number of them  we are going to take the facts that we find and we are going to apply the law as its been set out by the Supreme Court and other courts and well take the appropriate action.**

The FCC does not monitor broadcast content, but it reviews or investigates all complaints. But it is highly rare for it to take action or issue fines, and that is the case with Colbert, too. The FCC has issued no fines under Pai, who was appointed chairman by President Trump, and last issued a sanction in 2015, against a station in Roanoke, Va.

Broadcasters have a safe harbor for indecent and or profane content between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.  and Late Show falls within that time frame. (Broadcasters have no safe harbor for obscene content, but that tends to be applied to pornographic material). Moreover, what Colbert said was bleeped  which would make it all the more difficult for the FCC to make a case.

The FCC does not take action against individual shows or performers. Rather, it issues fines or sanctions against whatever station aired a broadcast.

But Michael Winship, president of WGAE, and Howard Rodman, president of WGAW, said that they were appalled by Pais remarks, apparently because he didnt dismiss the complaints out of hand and view Colberts joke as a form of protected political speech.

Pais remarks are just the latest in a series of statements by the current administration indicating a willful disregard of the First Amendment, they said in a statement. Colbert was poking fun at authority, a time-honored American tradition and an essential principle of democracy. What is obscene is not what Colbert said but any attempt by the government to stifle dissent and creativity. Our unions vehemently support Colbert and his writers and will fight for their or anyones  right to publicly express his or her opinion of our elected officials.

An FCC spokesman had no comment.

What seems to have triggered alarms in this case is that the Colbert joke was already the source of controversy  and Pais comments quickly went viral. In the past, FCC officials would stop short of characterizing their normal review of complaints as investigations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> LONDON (AP)  Police in Ireland are refusing to comment on a blasphemy complaint and investigation involving British comedian Stephen Fry.

The inquiry came to light when the Irish Independent newspaper reported Saturday that a member of the public had contacted police about remarks Fry made in 2015 to Irish broadcaster RTE.

**The individual told the newspaper it was his duty to complain under the Defamation Act, which makes blasphemy a crime punishable by a fine of up to 25,000 euros ($27,500.)**

**In the interview, Fry was asked what he would say if he were confronted by God.**

**He replied: How dare you create a world in which there is such misery that is not our fault? Its not right.**

Police say they wont comment on an ongoing investigation.

Frys agent, Christian Hodell, also declined to comment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **From CNNmoney.com:**

Bill O'Reilly says his former protege at Fox News, Jesse Watters, will continue to make a series of public appearances with him this year. Fox News has other ideas.

O'Reilly has been actively promoting upcoming dates for "The Spin Stops Here Tour," a variation of the political comedy shows he has performed with Dennis Miller, the "Saturday Night Live" alum, since 2011.

Watters joined the tour this year. In March, he appeared with O'Reilly and Miller at a show held in Omaha.



For days on "No Spin News," the podcast that has become his primary outlet since he was ousted at Fox News, O'Reilly told listeners that Watters will appear at upcoming shows, which include stops in Baltimore, Tampa and Las Vegas.
"We're going to do the tour," O'Reilly said last week. "The tour stays. Miller and Watters and me."

**But a source close to the situation said that Fox News is working out contractual issues to get Watters off the tour.**

Both Fox News and Robert Barnett, Watters' agent, declined to comment. Representatives for O'Reilly and the tour did not respond to multiple inquiries.
O'Reilly continued for most of this week to promote Watters' planned appearances on the tour. But on Thursday, while encouraging listeners to purchase tickets to the shows, O'Reilly left Watters' name out.

"Miller and I will make it worth your while," O'Reilly said.
The prospect of Fox News' on-air talent appearing alongside O'Reilly is clearly something the network's brass would like to avoid.

After reigning as the king of cable news for 16 years, O'Reilly was forced out of Fox News last month after the New York Times revealed that five different women had been paid settlements totaling $13 million after accusing him of sexual harassment or verbal abuse.
For Fox, it was another public relations nightmare and another meteoric fall for one of its icons, coming nine months after the network's powerful former chairman Roger Ailes left his post amid a number of sexual harassment allegations. Both O'Reilly and Ailes have denied the allegations against them.

The tour, if it continued as planned, would serve as a reunion for O'Reilly and Watters, who appeared on Fox News together for years.
Watters was a longtime regular on "The O'Reilly Factor," on which he hosted a recurring segment that was best known for ambush interviews.
But this year, Watters stepped out of O'Reilly's shadow with the launch of his own weekend program in January. Two months later, Watters landed an interview with President Donald Trump. On top of that, Watters is also a co-host of "The Five," Fox's roundtable program that moved to a primetime slot following O'Reilly's exit from the network last month.
Watters himself attracted criticism late last month after he made a remark about Ivanka Trump that many people perceived as vulgar, although he denied that he was implying anything suggestive. </TEXT>

I hear your point *but* I do not think the GOP will succeed in spinning this, particularly in the face of Democrats going on offense of the ACA, as this video post purports they should go, and your comment doesn't respond to the "offense" point which is what the post is about. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People did not know what Obamacare is, nor did Democrats move the debate away from "keep or repeal" or express and fix the flaws of Obamacare appropriately, or rather, explain how the Republicans created those flaws in the ACA and/or held up the fixing of those flaws.

But, now, public opinion and awareness is changing and Rep. Maloney is making a direct appeal to Dems to show up and explain what the ACA *is* and how Trump is changing it for the worse.

<TEXT> *Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney, (D, NY), talks with Rachel Maddow about the pressure he is putting on GOP Rep. John Faso who represents a neighboring district and broke his promise to constituents with his vote for the Republicans health care bill.*


**Democrat Rep. Maloney on Republican Rep. Faso Voting Yes on TrumpHealthCare:**

"I'll tell you what, there are members of Congress who will look you in the eye and will not lie to you about something so serious."

"And if this guy won't stand up, and explain it to you and the people he represents, my neighbors in the Hudson Valley, well I'm gonna do it."

"I think every Republican who voted for this thing ought to have to stand in front of their voters and explain it."

"And if it takes a Democrat to go in and do it for 'em for awhile, I'll explain what's in this bill. And if [Rep. Faso] doesn't like it, he should stand up and explain it himself."

**"I mean, I think we ought to get on offense on this, and maybe a Democrat ought to go into every district where a Republican who supported Trumpcare won't hold a town hall meeting and do it for them, you know, sit in that chair and say,** ***I'll stand here and answer your questions until your own congressmen starts doing his job.*** </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Congressman Adam Schiff talks with Rachel Maddow about the Republican perspective that values tax cuts for the wealthy over more people having health care and the likely backlash Republicans will face in 2018 for gutting Obamacare.*

**Rep. Adam Schiff on ACA to constituent and why GOP repealing:**

"And I like the fact that tens of millions of people that can't get access to healthcare are going to get it."


"And he said something after that Rachel, that i have to say SHOCKED me, and I thought I'd heard everything, he said: *You really think that's such a good thing?* And I said: *Well yes, don't you?* And he said: *No, I don't. If they can't afford it, they shouldn't have it.*"


"And I knew the second he had said it, he was speaking for a great many of my colleagues in Congress, who at root believe that if you can't afford coverage, if you're, you know, you have pediatric cancer and your parents can't afford it or you are elderly and have diabetes and you can't afford it, [GOP says] that is your problem."


"And, at the heart of this is a conclusion that among a majority of my colleagues sadly today, they would rather give a big tax cut for people that are already doing well, then try to help people get access to healthcare.  And that made it a sad day, all the sadder to see people celebrating it." </TEXT>

<TEXT> From parents.com..:

When you talk about preexisting conditions, you probably think of things like diabetes, heart disease and cancer. But the reality is that healthcare companies consider a whole slew of common health concerns preexisting conditions. Odds are, if youre a mom, you probably already have one of them. And now that the American Healthcare Act passed the House of Representatives todayif it becomes law, your health insurer could charge you thousands more for your coverage or reduce your insurance coverage because of these "preexisting conditions.

"Things that are incredibly common for women, including C-sections, pregnancy and postpartum care, will all be considered preexisting conditions," says Kristyn Brandi, OB/GYN at Boston Medical Center, and current fellow at Physicians for Reproductive Health. "A lot of women would end up paying out of pocket for healthcare, which would definitely be a big problem for most women across the country. Women are particularly at risk because they use more healthcare than other people do. They dont think of pregnancy as a preexisting condition, so people dont realize how much they will be impacted.

"That's one of the main concerns with the revised American Healthcare Act, which has came back to the House for a vote this afternoon after failing to attract enough votes when first unveiled back in March. What's new with this one? Rep. Tom McArthur (R-NJ) added a new amendment that allows states to apply for waivers from enacting any portion of the lawincluding requiring insurers to provide any of the "essential health benefits," like emergency care benefits and preexisting condition coverage... </TEXT>

"By which I mean he was impulsively tweeting venomous, half-baked thoughts  in this case his reaction to late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel's monologue Monday about his newborn son's dramatic battle for life at Children's Hospital Los Angeles."

"*Sorry Jimmy Kimmel*," wrote the feisty Republican who represented the northwest suburban 8th U.S. Congressional District from 2011 to 2013. "*Your sad story doesn't obligate me or anybody else to pay for somebody else's health care*."

"Jimmy Kimmel tearfully spoke about how his newborn son had to undergo open heart surgery:"


"*If your baby is going to die and it doesn't have to, it shouldn't matter how much money you make*," he said. "*I think that's something that, whether you're a Republican, or a Democrat or something else, we all agree on that, right*?

"Well, no. Wrong."

"**I understand Kimmel's desire not to sully his powerful tale with partisanship, but the central difference of opinion in this major battle over insurance coverage is partisan. Democrats generally believe that access to consistent, affordable, quality health care is a right. Republicans generally believe that it is a privilege properly enjoyed by those with the means to afford it, like access to quality restaurants.**"

***But the MSNBC host said she's "worried that he will figure it out."***


President Donald Trumps incompetence isnt such a bad thing, according to Rachel Maddow.


On Tuesdays Late Night with Seth Meyers, the MSNBC host said she was actually comforted by the fact that [Trump] cant do anything that he wants to do  despite the GOP also controlling both houses of Congress. But Maddow did says shes worried that he will figure it out.


I mean, its weird, its like the overall question is: Are you comforted by his incompetence? she asked. Would you rather have a competent person trying to do bad things or would you rather have an incompetent person trying to do bad things?


Maddow also said leading Democrats needed to re-discover their inner water skier and allow themselves to be towed along by the boat that is the American people.

Counting on the Democratic Party and its elected officials to sort of lead an election campaign against Trump, or to lead on policy stuff, or to lead people toward making Democratic choices hasnt been working, she said.

Those officials would be unstoppable if they took their cues from grassroots activists who have come to the fore in protests during the Trump administration, Maddow said.

"What is going on? And could this affect UK communications regulator Ofcom's forthcoming judgement on whether to reject the Murdoch family's bid for the 61% of broadcaster Sky they don't own?"

***Echoes of hacking scandal***


"That is certainly the hope of the cross-party group of MPs who have been lobbying Ofcom, and who would rather not see the Murdochs consolidate their power here in the UK. Interestingly, former business secretary Sir Vince Cable said on BBC Radio 4's World at One that Ofcom told him they were in listening mode. And there is certainly a lot of noise emanating from Fox News HQ in Manhattan right now."

"There is a palpable fear in New York that the sexual harassment scandal which has toppled Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly could be an American version of the phone hacking scandal that dogged Rupert Murdoch's British newspapers. The echoes are eerie"



***A new broom?***


"In conversations with seasoned observers of Planet Murdoch, individuals at 21st Century Fox, and opponents of that company's bid for the 61% of Sky it doesn't already own, that narrative finds plenty of support."

"That both Ailes and O'Reilly have gone does give credence to the idea that Fox News is being reconfigured by its parent company, 21st Century Fox, where Executive Chairman Lachlan, and CEO James - who are of equal status - want change. Since they acquired this joint status in June 2015, these two have made a concerted effort to modernise their father's firm...."


"What next for Fox News? Hannity's future remains unclear. Former UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, who works for Fox News, told me a fortnight ago that Tucker Carlson, the anchor who has replaced O'Reilly in the key 8pm slot, has long been thought of as his likely successor. In his first few days, Carlson has rated well."


"But the bigger drama is yet to come: the federal probes into whether payments were withheld from investors could intensify just as Ofcom consider whether to approve the Murdochs' bid for Sky. The last bid was of course derailed by the phone hacking scandal; and while Ofcom won't comment on what is a quasi-judicial process, their deliberations aren't taking place in a vacuum."






More from [BBC.com:](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39530455)

<TEXT> **From: Buzzfeed**

*The lawsuit, filed on the basis of gender and disability discrimination, comes as the embattled network faces mounting claims of sexual harassment and racial discrimination*

Fox News reporter Diana Falzone filed a lawsuit Monday against the network claiming she was sidelined from appearing on-air after writing an article detailing a medical condition which led to her infertility.

Falzone, host of Fox411 and other FoxNews.com shows, alleges that three days after her company-approved article titled "Women Should Never Suffer in Silence" ran in January, she was informed by her manager that she would never again be permitted to host her own show, conduct her own interviews, or even do voiceovers.

In the article, Falzone shared that she suffered from endometriosis  a condition where the tissue that normally lines the inside of the uterus actually grows outside of the uterus. This can cause severe pain and inflammation.

Shortly after the article was published, Falzone's supervisor told her the "second floor"  which houses the offices of Fox News executives  permanently banned her from appearing on air.

"The male-dominated senior management of Fox News obviously objected to the
fact that a female on-air host had disclosed that she suffers from a women's reproductive health condition, which, in their eyes, detracted from her sex appeal and made her less desirable," the lawsuit states.

Falzone also says she asked for an explanation, but her supervisor allegedly told her to look for another job.

The departure of Bill Shine could become that opportunity. Mediaite has learned that Hannity has what is called a key man clause in his contract. That means that his entire contract can be torn up if a particular person, the key man, leaves the company. In this case that person is Roger Ailes, who obviously left Fox last year. Mediaite has also learned that while Hannitys current contract is up in December of 2020, he must only provide 60 days notice if he intends to execute on that key man provision. At that point, he would be free to pursue other opportunities. </TEXT>

<TEXT> LONDON (AP)  The London Marathon started five days ago, and Tom Harrison is nearly done.

It's not that he's a slow runner. It's that he's a slow crawler, particularly wearing his gorilla suit.

The man dubbed Mr. Gorilla is raising money for the Gorilla Organization  so far more than 22,000 pounds ($28,500) have been pledged.

He's hopeful of finishing the race Saturday, with his two sons expected at the finish line to celebrate his feat.

He ran the marathon last year raising money for gorillas, but is finding crawling much more stressful.

"It's shoulders, hamstrings, glutes, quads, from the constant crouching," he says. "We're not really designed to do that."

Harrison says the money will be used to protect endangered gorillas in Africa. </TEXT>

<TEXT> WASHINGTON (AP)  **President Donald Trump "has no intention" of releasing his taxes returns to the public, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Wednesday, asserting Americans have "plenty of information" about the president's financial matters.**

"The president has no intention. The president has released plenty of information and I think has given more financial disclosure than anybody else. I think the American population has plenty of information," he said, inaccurately characterizing the president's disclosures...


**The comment came as the secretary briefed reporters on the president's new proposal to overhaul taxes.** Democrats have sought to use the tax debate to pressure Trump to release his returns, arguing the information is necessary to evaluate how Trump's tax proposals would affect his personal wealth and his business' bottom line.


Mnuchin declined to comment on how Trump would benefit from his proposals. He and other administration officials left the room as reporters shouted questions about how the plan would affect the Trump family.

Trump, a billionaire, owns a global real estate, marketing and property management company, which at the start of his presidency he placed in a trust that he can revoke at any time. His daughter and son-in-law, White House advisers, are also holding onto significant business assets. And Trump's adult sons run his Trump Organization...

While there has been a great deal of speculation and consternation about the prospect of Donald Trump pressing the nuclear button, it turns out there is another button the President is privy to.

Mr Trump has a special wooden box on his desk in the Oval Office of the White House containing a single button which he has been using to order glasses of Coca-Cola.

The rectangular box is located on the Resolute Desk which Presidents have used for decades.

President Trump's penchant for the soda was revealed in his Associated Press interview inside the Oval Office ahead of his 100th day as President.

A man accustomed to wealth and its trappings, Trump has embraced life in the Executive Mansion, often regaling guests with trivia about the historic dcor, wrote the journalist Julian Pace.

With the push of a red button placed on the Resolute Desk that presidents have used for decades, a White House butler soon arrived with a Coke for the president. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **"Justice Neil Gorsuch may face his first recusal when the justices in May take up a petition that involvesand features prominentlyone of his most famous dissents: the case of the burping 13-year-old student."**




"The case started back in 2011, when a physical education teacher at an Albuquerque middle school called for help over her school-issued radio. A 13-year-old seventh grader had generated fake burps, which made the other students laugh and hampered class proceedings, according to the panel decision. After the boy ignored her requests to stop, the teacher ordered him to sit in the hallway. There, he leaned into the classroom entrance way and continued to burp. She called for help."



"A school resource officer asked the boy to accompany him to the school administrative office. He told the boy that he was arresting him for interfering with the educational processa petty misdemeanor offense under New Mexico law. The officer handcuffed the teen and drove him to juvenile hall."


"The boys mother sued, alleging violation of her sons civil rights because of the arrest and a subsequent strip search in an unrelated incident. The divided Tenth Circuit panel affirmed qualified immunity for the officer and school officials on all claims.
Gorsuch, writing in dissent, said: The simple fact is the New Mexico Court of Appeals long ago alerted law enforcement that the statutory language on which the officer relied for the arrest in this case does not criminalize noise[s] or diversion[s] that merely disturb the peace or good order of individual classes. Any reasonable officer, Gorsuch wrote then, should have known that arresting a now compliant class clown for burping was going a step too far."



"In the high court, the boys counsel, Kennedy, argues: The petition argues simply that the state interest is obviouschildhood conduct that disturbs the peace of a school session is not criminal and children should be kept out of juvenile detention when possible. 
When the state interest against arresting children is balanced with the liberty interest of the child, the unconstitutionality of the arrest is obvious."


"Albuquerque assistant city attorney Kristin Dalton, representing Officer Arthur Acosta, asked the justices not to take the case.
While the facts underlying petitioners claims may be of interest because they are somewhat unique, the legal issue involved is nothing more than the application of New Mexico law to the qualified immunity analysis, she wrote. The Tenth Circuits application of qualified immunity was not irregular; rather, it utilized long-settled law."


"Gorsuch hasnt yet recused in any matter at the high court. He faced, however, an early test: Whether to recuse in a case in which Hogan Lovells partner Neal Katyalwho advocated for Gorsuch during his confirmation proceedingswas arguing. Gorsuch did not step down."

<TEXT> **Independent:**

While there has been a great deal of speculation and consternation about the prospect of Donald Trump pressing the nuclear button, it turns out there is another button the President is privy to.

Mr Trump has a special wooden box on his desk in the Oval Office of the White House containing a single button which he has been using to order glasses of Coca-Cola.

The rectangular box is located on the Resolute Desk which Presidents have used for decades.

President Trump's penchant for the soda was revealed in his Associated Press interview inside the Oval Office ahead of his 100th day as President.

A man accustomed to wealth and its trappings, Trump has embraced life in the Executive Mansion, often regaling guests with trivia about the historic dcor, wrote the journalist Julian Pace.

With the push of a red button placed on the Resolute Desk that presidents have used for decades, a White House butler soon arrived with a Coke for the president. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Rachel Maddow reports on a bizarre impasse between the House Oversight Committee and the Trump White House when a request for paperwork on the security clearance of disgraced former Trump NSA was met with the claim that such paperwork could not be produced.*


Then Rachel talked to Rep Cummings: [Cummings: May take White House subpoenas to get Flynn docs
](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/cummings-may-take-white-house-subpoenas-to-get-flynn-docs-929687619966)

**"This is not some witch hunt, this is about a fight for the soul of our democracy."** ***-Rep. Elijah Cummings***



*Congressman Elijah Cummings talks with Rachel Maddow about the frustration of the House Oversight Committee that the White House won't produce documents on disgraced former Trump NSA Mike Flynn and what it may take to get those documents:*


**Rep. Cummings: "If it were me or you, there would be volumes probably of documents, interviews they may have done and other people, looking into your background, and they're claiming they have none! But on the other hand, they say:** ***Oh, we're not gonna give you the documents we have..*** **You know, this hocus-pocus, fake news, false news; I don't have time for that. What I'm trying to do is make sure that we pursue this investigation and go where the evidence leads."**

<TEXT> From vanityfair.com:

*THE* first 100 days are traditionally a time to reflect on accomplishments of a president, and Trump hasnt got a lot of those, Colbert said. He still hasnt filled his cabinet; he didnt repeal Obamacare; there are still Muslims.


*AS* of Monday, this week became a critical time not only for the president, but also for late-night; the W.G.A. overwhelmingly voted to authorize a strike, which could send Colbert and his fellow late-night hosts straight into reruns. Evidently, Colbert and his fellow hosts are still making hay while they can. Hosts on Monday night particularly honed in on the potential government shutdown: if Congress doesnt send Trump a government funding bill to be approved by midnight Friday, the government could stop in its tracks. As some have noted, that would make Trump the first president in history to have a shutdown on his hands within his first 100 days.



*WE* may have a government shutdown if Congress doesnt pass a budget, Colbert said Monday night. And Trump is so desperate to have something to show for his first 100 days that he just threw in funding for the border wallwhich may kill the bill and make the United States financially insolvent. So, Trump really is running the country like one of his businesses."

*ON* Late Night, Meyers also honed in on the possible government shutdown. If this were a movie, it would be called 100 Dayz and Confused, Meyers quipped, adding later, Are we sure the government wasnt shut down already? Because it was reported recently that President Trump has appointed fewer than three-dozen of the top 1,000 officials he needs to run the federal government. Under Trump, our federal government is staffed as well as a Duane Reade on a Sunday morning.

<TEXT> LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP)  Arkansas' execution protocol includes three drugs, two of which are used in surgery and one that benefits cardiac patients. A look at the drugs:

___

**MIDAZOLAM**

Midazolam is the first of the three drugs administered to sedate the inmate. Because the state's supply reaches its expiration date April 30, Arkansas scheduled eight executions before then.

At normal adult doses of around 4 mg for routine surgery, midazolam can slow or stop breathing to the point that medical literature advises doctors to monitor patients closely. With a 500 mg dose listed in the state's execution protocol, Arkansas expects that the inmates will not be aware they are dying.

In federal court testimony earlier this month, doctors differed on whether midazolam is an appropriate execution drug, though the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in 2015 that it is.

U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker had said earlier this month that Arkansas' execution protocol doesn't outline what would happen if the inmate were to remain conscious even if given a double dose. She also said the protocol doesn't lay out what executioners intend to do to ensure that the inmates are unconscious. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed her decision, and the U.S. Supreme Court let the appeals court decision stand.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent that a lower court established that "midazolam creates a substantial risk of severe pain."

In typical medical settings, midazolam relaxes people and produces amnesia.

Using redacted drug labels, The Associated Press identified West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp. as the likely manufacturer of Arkansas' midazolam supply.

___

**VECURONIUM BROMIDE**

The second drug, vecuronium bromide, is a muscle relaxant, but not in the typical sense. Rather than being prescribed for tightness or muscle pain, vecuronium is used to prevent muscles from moving so they don't interfere with surgeons. After receiving the drug, patients must be on a ventilator or they will suffocate because their diaphragm cannot move.

One doctor testified that being given vecuronium bromide without sedation and ventilation would be equivalent to being held underwater. The typical dose is up to .1 mg/kg intravenously, or 8.5 mg for the typical inmate set to die this month. Under Arkansas' protocol, executioners administer 100 mg, or more than 11 times the typical dose, five minutes after the midazolam is administered and once the inmate is unconscious.

The AP last year used redacted drug labels to identify Hospira, which was purchased by Pfizer, as the likely manufacturer of Arkansas' vecuronium bromide. The supplier McKesson Corp. has said it sold Arkansas the drug for use in inmate health care, not executions. A judge last week blocked Arkansas from using the McKesson-supplied drug, but the Arkansas Supreme Court put that order on hold.

**POTASSIUM CHLORIDE**

Potassium is essential for maintaining a proper heart rhythm, and levels that are too high or too low can cause heart trouble. Medical experts who testified before Baker said that the final drug, potassium chloride, causes considerable pain when injected and is typically diluted when given to patients.

A typical dose is 20 milliequivalents delivered over several hours. Arkansas uses 240 mEq immediately after the inmate is injected with vecuronium bromide.

The director of the Arkansas Department of Correction, Wendy Kelley, testified earlier this month that Arkansas was not charged for its current supply of potassium chloride. She said the supplier wished to remain anonymous and did not want to generate a bill of sale so there would be a smaller chance of being identified.

Fresenius Kabi USA, a subsidiary of the German company Fresenius Kabi, said that it appeared to have manufactured the potassium chloride the state is using...**From AP**

<TEXT> WASHINGTON (AP)  "President Donald Trump will sign executive orders this week aimed at expanding offshore oil drilling and reviewing national monument designations made by his predecessors, continuing the Republican's assault on Democratic President Barack Obama's environmental legacy."


"The orders could expand oil drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans and upend public lands protections put in place in Utah, Maine and other states. The Antiquities Act of 1906 authorizes the president to declare federal lands of historic or scientific value to be "national monuments" and restrict how the lands can be used."


"Administration officials on Monday confirmed the expected moves. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss the president's upcoming actions."


"Obama used his power under the act to permanently preserve more land and water using national monument designations than any other president. The land is generally off limits to timber harvesting, mining and pipelines, and commercial development."


"Utah Republicans were infuriated when Obama created the Bears Ears National Monument in December on more than 1 million acres of land that's sacred to Native Americans and home to tens of thousands of archaeological sites, including ancient cliff dwellings."


"Republicans also objected when Obama created the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine last summer on 87,500 acres of donated forestland. The expanse includes part of the Penobscot River and stunning views of Mount Katahdin, Maine's tallest mountain."

**Republicans have asked Trump to reverse the two designations, saying they add an unnecessary layer of federal control and could stymie commercial development.**

"Trump's staff has been reviewing the decisions to determine economic impacts, whether the law was followed and whether there was appropriate consultation with local officials."

"Before leaving office in January, Obama designated the bulk of U.S.-owned waters in the Arctic Ocean and certain areas in the Atlantic Ocean as indefinitely off limits to future oil and gas leasing."


"The move was seen as an effort to put some finishing touches on Obama's environmental legacy while also testing Trump's promise to unleash the nation's untapped energy reserves."


"Obama cited an arcane provision in a 1953 law to ban offshore leases in the waters permanently. The statute says that *the president of the United States may, from time to time, withdraw from disposition any of the unleased lands of the outer Continental Shelf.*"


"White House officials said when Obama imposed the order they were confident it would withstand legal challenge, adding that the language of the statute provides no authority for subsequent presidents to undo permanent withdrawals. Environmental groups say a similar logic applies to national monuments and note that no president has acted to undo a monument designation made by a predecessor."


"The Atlantic waters placed off-limits to new oil and gas leasing are 31 canyons stretching off the coast of New England south to Virginia. Existing leases aren't affected." </TEXT>

<TEXT> In many respects, weve been heading in this direction for several months. While first quarter ratings data for 2017 showed Carlsons show at number 2  just behind OReilly  the real story may have been Maddow, who rode the wave of Donald Trumps tax returns to best Carlson for the month of March among the all-important 25-54 year-old demographic. With a March 15 interview with President Trump, Carlson should have owned the month. The cracks in Foxs 9:00 p.m facade become even starker when one looks at overall growth. In Q1, Foxs primetime audience grew 20% opposed to MSNBCs 61%.

All this means is that the trends were moving in Maddows direction before Carlsons departure. With her formidable opponent gone, the question becomes whether Foxs replacement for the hour, The Five, will be adequate to reverse Maddows gains. The evidence suggests it will not.

The most recent ratings data comparing The Five and Maddow are curious. Overall, The Five came in third, while Maddow came in at a distant seventh, but thats where the good news ends for Fox.

Among those coveted 25-54 year-olds, The Five fell to seventh in Q1, while Maddow bumps up to sixth. Yes, its not an apples to apples comparison, but you dont need to be a rocket scientist to figure that its not a renaissance of conservative millennials putting The Five on top overall, but rather, the loyalty of very, very old people. And one of the reasons theyre not so coveted is because, well, they consistently tend to die  which is generally bad for ratings.

Now you might say the Fox audience is baked in and would happily watch a very smart koala willing to make fun of Berkeley college students. After all, where can those Fox viewers go anyway. CNN? MSNBC?  The Blaze? While this may be partly true, The Factor interregnum last week shows the limits of this assumption. While OReillys ratings actually went up as his career spiraled to its ignominious end, Foxs cavalcade of potential replacements couldnt say the same. On April 11, during what became his last show ever, OReilly notched 3.6 million views. The very next day, guest host Dana Perino dropped to 2.8 million and Eric Bolling only managed to get 3.1 million the next night.

Its also worth noting that OReilly was critical to Fox as a spillover host, meaning that some percent of his gargantuan audience would stick around for Tucker. If Carlson cant match OReillys firepower, that spillover is going to shrink too. After all, it may be hard for Carlson to be as phony or contrived as he thought Bill OReilly was in 2003. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From ***HuffPost.com***


"As of Wednesday, Bill OReilly is officially out at Fox News, a turn of events that has some rejoicing. Even though OReilly has been ousted only after it came out that he and Fox had settled at least 5 sexual harassment suits over the past 15 years  and those claims began to hurt ad dollars  his termination still feels like a win in the ongoing battle against sexist men with huge media platforms."

"And yet Fox has announced that OReillys slot will be filled by anchor and commentator Tucker Carlson. While Carlson certainly doesnt have any highly publicized sexual harassment allegations looming over him (a marked improvement!), he has a well-recorded history of dismissing sexual harassment and women in general."

"Lets take a stroll down memory lane, shall we?..."

**1. He complained about Ashley Grahams political Sports Illustrated cover.**

Does it really need to be political? Carlson asked, after the Sports Illustrated made history with its 2016 swimsuit issue by featuring plus-size model Ashley Graham on its cover, prompting praise for celebrating women of all sizes.

Keep it out of my swimsuit issue, Carlson says via voice-over in the clip below. 

**2. He refused to apologize when a writer at his website, The Daily Caller, referred to the NYC Mayors spokesperson as a self-righteous bitch with a labia"**


In 2015, an email obtained by Buzzfeed revealed that Carlsons brother Buckley Carlson, a writer for his news site The Daily Caller, referred to called New York Mayor De Blasios spokesperson Amy Spitalnick as a self-righteous bitch. The email, which had been sent to Tucker, also speculated as to whether Spitalnick had ever been given a pearl necklace, accused her of having extreme dick-fright, and referred to her as LabiaFace. Oh, and it was sent to Spitalnick herself by mistake.  



When the email came to light, Carlson declined to apologize on his brothers behalf and quipped that the email had been meant in the nicest way.



**3. He claimed that Democrats made up the concept of sexual harassment.**


Yup. In 2006, during a segment of his old MSNBC show in which Democratic strategist Steve McMahon said that the Dems taking control of Congress would mean an era of a lot more fun, Carlson responded: 



A lot more fun? This is a group that made up the concept of sexual harassment. You look great today. Boom, Im charging you with a crime.  Do you know what I mean? Its not a group I associate with fun. You want a sex scandal, the Republican party, baby, thats where you go.



**4. He also showed that he actually doesnt understand the concept of sexual harassment at all.**


According to MediaMatters, on an episode of Hannity in February 2010, Carlson defended an ESPN analyst who had been suspended for making sexist comments about a womans clothes on air.


Because the sexist comments were made publicly, Carlson explained that the analyst had done done nothing wrong because: Sexual harassment by definition takes place in private.



**5. He blamed women for sexism in politics. 
On a 2007 episode of his MSNBC show Tucker, Carlson questioned the idea that woman have it harder in politics, citing the fact that most voters are women.**


He asked: If women were so anxious to have women in Congress, and there were so many great female candidates running, then why wouldnt Congress be 52 percent female?


Welcome to internalized misogyny and structural sexism, Tucker. 


**6. He told political writer Lauren Duca to stick to the thigh-high boots.**


After her Teen Vogue article on Donald Trump and gaslighting went viral in December 2016, Carlson invited writer Lauren Duca on his show. He then proceeded to try and devalue her opinions and political writing because she writes for Teen Vogue, and has written non-political pieces in the past.


You should stick to the thigh-high boots, he said. You are better at that. 


**7. He defended President Donald Trumps Grab em by the pussy comments.**


When audio of President Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women leaked in October 2016, Carlson claimed that the outrage over the comment was exaggerated.


Nobody is actually shocked by this and everyone is pretending to be, he said.


**8. He described Hillary Clinton as castrating.**

Because the idea of a female president is apparently the most terrifying thing ever, Carlson dedicated a segment of his MSNBC show in 2007 to talk about how scary Hillary Clinton is.


Theres just something about her that feels castrating, overbearing, and scary, he said. 


**9. He said the Day Without A Woman boycott was an attack on white men.**


After A Day Without A Woman took place on International Womens Day this year, Carlson declared in a segment that because the day was designed to avoid shopping anywhere but women and POC-owned businesses, it was an act of hostility and obviously an attack on white men.

<TEXT> "As of Wednesday, Bill OReilly is officially out at Fox News, a turn of events that has some rejoicing. Even though OReilly has been ousted only after it came out that he and Fox had settled at least 5 sexual harassment suits over the past 15 years  and those claims began to hurt ad dollars  his termination still feels like a win in the ongoing battle against sexist men with huge media platforms."

"And yet Fox has announced that OReillys slot will be filled by anchor and commentator Tucker Carlson. While Carlson certainly doesnt have any highly publicized sexual harassment allegations looming over him (a marked improvement!), he has a well-recorded history of dismissing sexual harassment and women in general."

"Lets take a stroll down memory lane, shall we?..."

**1. He complained about Ashley Grahams political Sports Illustrated cover.**

Does it really need to be political? Carlson asked, after the Sports Illustrated made history with its 2016 swimsuit issue by featuring plus-size model Ashley Graham on its cover, prompting praise for celebrating women of all sizes.

Keep it out of my swimsuit issue, Carlson says via voice-over in the clip below. 

**2. He refused to apologize when a writer at his website, The Daily Caller, referred to the NYC Mayors spokesperson as a self-righteous bitch with a labia"**


In 2015, an email obtained by Buzzfeed revealed that Carlsons brother Buckley Carlson, a writer for his news site The Daily Caller, referred to called New York Mayor De Blasios spokesperson Amy Spitalnick as a self-righteous bitch. The email, which had been sent to Tucker, also speculated as to whether Spitalnick had ever been given a pearl necklace, accused her of having extreme dick-fright, and referred to her as LabiaFace. Oh, and it was sent to Spitalnick herself by mistake.  



When the email came to light, Carlson declined to apologize on his brothers behalf and quipped that the email had been meant in the nicest way.



**3. He claimed that Democrats made up the concept of sexual harassment.**


Yup. In 2006, during a segment of his old MSNBC show in which Democratic strategist Steve McMahon said that the Dems taking control of Congress would mean an era of a lot more fun, Carlson responded: 



A lot more fun? This is a group that made up the concept of sexual harassment. You look great today. Boom, Im charging you with a crime.  Do you know what I mean? Its not a group I associate with fun. You want a sex scandal, the Republican party, baby, thats where you go.



**4. He also showed that he actually doesnt understand the concept of sexual harassment at all.**


According to MediaMatters, on an episode of Hannity in February 2010, Carlson defended an ESPN analyst who had been suspended for making sexist comments about a womans clothes on air.


Because the sexist comments were made publicly, Carlson explained that the analyst had done done nothing wrong because: Sexual harassment by definition takes place in private.



**5. He blamed women for sexism in politics. 
On a 2007 episode of his MSNBC show Tucker, Carlson questioned the idea that woman have it harder in politics, citing the fact that most voters are women.**


He asked: If women were so anxious to have women in Congress, and there were so many great female candidates running, then why wouldnt Congress be 52 percent female?


Welcome to internalized misogyny and structural sexism, Tucker. 


**6. He told political writer Lauren Duca to stick to the thigh-high boots.**


After her Teen Vogue article on Donald Trump and gaslighting went viral in December 2016, Carlson invited writer Lauren Duca on his show. He then proceeded to try and devalue her opinions and political writing because she writes for Teen Vogue, and has written non-political pieces in the past.

<TEXT>  **RACHEL MADDOW SHOW 4/19/17**

*Senator Elizabeth Warren talks with Rachel Maddow about the effect that civic activism has had on motivating members of Congress and thwarting Donald Trump's agenda.* ***Duration: 5:32***


**Rachel Maddow:** Do you feel like, on that Russia issue, on the issue of needing a special prosecutor or an independent investigation as you say, on some of the other policy issues that you've talked about just here tonight, do you feel like, the sorta 'people power' that we have seen in the streets, the new civic engagement for people on the center and the left opposed to this president, do you feel like that is the most effective lever for getting those things moving?"

**Senator Elizabeth Warren:** "Oh, absolutely."

**Maddow:** "More so than you and your colleagues in the Senate are advocating for them?"
 

**Sen. Warren:**  "Look, more is more. Are you kidding? I'll be out there, I'll shout at the top of my lungs about this. And I will encourage every one of my colleagues to do it, and my colleagues are getting stronger on all of these issues."

"But the key...I talk about going to the inauguration, seeing Donald Trump, with my own eyes, I actually wanted to see him, I wanted to think about him every single moment when I wake up, and everyday when I wake up."

"But the very next day, going to the woman's March, at Boston Common, and, and, Im thinking, completely into this, on a Saturday morning, it's cold out in Boston and I'm thinking, *how are we gonna fight back against Trump?* And at this point, I know we got to have an army. It's the only way we can do this, we don't have the votes in the house, we don't have the votes in the Senate, we gotta have an army."

"I'm thinking, *How do you raise an army, what does an army look like? Where does an army come from? What does an army look like in a case like this?*"

"And, so, as we're rounding the corner to go into Boston Common, 
I look up, and I'm seeing all these people moving through the common, women in pink pussy hats, and men pushing strollers, and kids riding bicycles."

"And I look over, and there's this man with this little girl on his shoulders and she's holding up this sign carefully hand lettered and the sign says, **I fight like a girl!** And I thought, *Me too, sweetie.* And, that for me, was the moment. I said, ***This is our army.*** And it did change from that moment, Rachel." </TEXT>

<TEXT> NEW YORK (AP)  "New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg urged world leaders not to follow President Donald Trump's lead on climate change and declared his intention to help save an international agreement to reduce carbon emissions..."

"...Instead of helping to re-ignite his political career, he said the new book offered a specific policy objective: To help save an international agreement, negotiated in Paris, to reduce global carbon emissions."

"The Trump administration is debating whether to abandon the pact as the president promised during his campaign. Under the agreement, the U.S. pledged that by 2025 it would reduce its annual greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels, which would be a reduction of about 1.6 billion tons.

"Bloomberg said he believed the U.S. would hit that goal regardless of what Trump does because of leadership at the state level and market forces already at play in the private sector."

"Washington won't determine the fate of our ability to meet our Paris commitment," he said in an email Saturday to the AP. "And what a tragedy it would be if the failure to understand that led to an unraveling of the agreement. We hope this book will help to correct that wrong impression  and help save the Paris deal."

"Bloomberg already plays a significant role in shaping some of the nation's fiercest policy debates, having invested millions of dollars in one advocacy group that pushes for stronger gun control and another that promotes liberal immigration policies. In the new book, which follows what a spokeswoman described as $80 million in donations to the Sierra Club in recent years, the New York businessman solidifies his status as a prominent climate change advocate as well."

"His policy repertoire aligns him with core values of the Democratic Party, although the Democrat-turned-Republican-turned independent has no formal political affiliation."

"In the interview, Bloomberg shrugged off conservatives who condemn him as a paternalistic New York elitist. He noted that policies he helped initiate in New York City  including a smoking ban and high taxes on sugary drinks  have eventually caught on elsewhere."

""My goal has been to save and improve lives," he said. "Some ways of doing that can be controversial at first, but end up being highly popular and successful.""

"In his new focus on climate change, Bloomberg directs particularly aggressive language at the coal industry..."

***Heres the official synopsis for The Keepers:***
From director Ryan White (The Case Against 8, Good Ol Freda) comes The Keepers, a riveting seven-part documentary series about the unsolved murder of a Baltimore nun and the horrific secrets and pain that linger nearly five decades after her death.


The series opens with the story of Sister Cathy Cesnik, a beloved nun and Catholic high school teacher in Baltimore who went missing on Nov. 7, 1969. Nearly two months later, her body was found  and, to this day, her murder remains unsolved.


The case returned to the spotlight in the 1990s when one of Sister Cathys former students  a woman only known as Jane Doe  came forward to share her experience of horrendous sexual abuse by the high schools chaplain. Incredibly, Jane Doe revealed she was also taken to Sister Cathys undiscovered body and told, See what happens when you say bad things about people. Despite this and testimony from other victims and witnesses of abuse, no one was held accountable, and the story was largely unreported outside of Baltimore.


Through conversations with dozens of friends, relatives, journalists, government officials and Baltimore citizens determined to uncover the truth, White pieces together a story that goes beyond the death of a beloved Catholic schoolteacher to encompass clergy abuse, repressed memories and government and religious institutions that he says at best, dropped the ball over the last 45 years  and, at worst, covered it up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Former U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday makes his first major appearance since leaving office, having chosen Chicago, the city where his political career started, to emerge from a three-month hiatus from the public eye."


"Obama will meet youth leaders and promote community organizing near the same South Side neighborhoods where his own activism blossomed and propelled him to two terms in the White House that ended with Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20."


"Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who served as Obamas first White House chief of staff, said that he was proud that Obama picked Chicago to make his last speech as president and the first in his post-presidency: "*I think it reflects his emotional, as well as his intellectual, commitment to this city and seeing this city as his home*.""


"Obama's continued connection to Chicago is important to the city, which has global aspirations as well as a palpable insecurity about its place in the world."


"During the last year of Obamas second term, Chicago laid claim to its share of his legacy by beating out Hawaii and New York as the site of his presidential library."


"David Axelrod, a former top political adviser to Obama, said the decision to house the library in Chicago should have eased any concerns that its residents may have had about the former Democratic president's commitment to the city."


"But Monday's event, he said, is another important sign of the former president's strong links to Chicago. "*Hes going to be more visible moving forward,* he said. *I think this is clearly a coming-out*."

<TEXT> PARIS (AP)  The final hours of many electoral campaigns are frantic affairs, dominated by last-minute pitches, late-breaking polls and massive social media campaigns aimed at drumming up turnout.

Not so in France.

Rules dating back more than half a century impose a 44-hour time out ahead of the polls' closure Sunday, meaning that politicians, journalists  and even ordinary citizens  are supposed to refrain from broadcasting any form of "electoral propaganda."

The Twitter feeds of France's 11 presidential candidates went quiet after midnight Friday. French television coverage was subdued. And if you're a journalist who has just received a newsworthy tip about one candidate or the other, you're just too late.

"The press can't publish such a story," said Pascal Jan, a professor of constitutional law at Sciences Po Bordeaux. "If there were a scandal, it should have been exposed Friday."

The national time out lasts from midnight Friday to 8 p.m. on Sunday in France and is intended to give voters time to reflect on their choice free from the distraction of surveys, radio commentary, and televised rallies.

The rules apply online as well, meaning that candidates and their campaigns can't do so much as post updates to Facebook or Instagram. The rules even apply to French voters  meaning that someone posting a pro-Socialist or pro-Republican message online could fall afoul of the law, at least in theory.

"It applies to all of us. It's totally forbidden," said Jan, although he acknowledged that, in practice, a single person posting wouldn't be sanctioned for expressing themselves online. "But if it became massive ... it would unbalance the contest and thus might influence the votes of those who were exposed to social media."

Amid chatter about foreign propaganda and so-called "fake news" possibly affecting the vote, French authorities seem to be keeping a close eye on potential violations of the law. Journalists have been sent repeated instructions about what is and isn't allowed in the last few days.

The various candidates' Twitter feeds, meanwhile, are frozen in time.... </TEXT>

<TEXT> TALLINN, Estonia (AP)  One of the reasons the U.S. Congress has launched an investigation into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election is to "prevent the same kind of thing happening" to its NATO and other allies, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said Saturday.


Ryan spoke at a news conference with Estonian Prime Minister Juri Ratas in Tallinn, the Estonian capital, during a visit by a bipartisan congressional delegation to the Baltic NATO member and staunch Washington ally.


While the Republican speaker claimed that Russia's alleged meddling didn't affect the outcome of the election  won by U.S. President Donald Trump  he said its actions "cannot be tolerated."


"One thing we know for certain is that Russia meddled in our election," Ryan said. "This is a foreign country trying to meddle within the internal activities of a sovereign country or a democracy."



He stressed the U.S has a responsibility to share the results of the Russia investigation with countries like Estonia, which in recent years has faced aggressive Russian disinformation campaigns along with Baltic neighbors Latvia and Lithuania.


"What we're doing through our investigation process is to figure out exactly what is it they did and how they did it so that we can help, equip and assist our allies to prevent the same kind of thing happening to them," Ryan said.


He thanked Estonia  a country of 1.3 million  for its strong commitment to cyber defense and NATO, and for being one of the very few NATO members to spend two percent of its GDP on defense.



"We're here to say thank you for meeting that pledge," Ryan said.


Estonia's relations with neighboring Russia have remained cold and uneasy since the former Soviet republic gained independence in 1991. Among other things, bilateral ties have suffered due to Estonia's success at catching spies working for Moscow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "The plan  draft legislation from House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Phil Roe, R-Tenn.  would deduct $2,400 from future service members paychecks to establish eligibility for revamped post-military education benefits. This was first reported Tuesday by Task   Purpose."

"Currently, the post-9/11 GI Bill offers full tuition to a four-year state college (or the equivalent tuition payout for a private school) plus a monthly housing stipend to any service member who spends at least three years on active duty, and to reservists who are mobilized to active-duty for extended periods. Troops wounded while serving are also eligible."

"Unlike the older Montgomery GI Bill benefit, the post-9/11 GI Bill does not require any fees or pay reductions for eligibility. The new proposal would change that, taking up to $100 a month from new enlistees paychecks for the right to access the benefit after they leave the ranks."

"The money collected would amount to a fraction of the overall cost of the veterans education benefit. Congressional staff estimate the move would bring in about $3.1 billion over the next 10 years, while total GI Bill spending is expected to total more than $100 billion over the same decade."

"Mulvaney told The Associated Press in an interview that "elections have consequences" and that "we want wall funding" as part of the catchall spending bill, which lawmakers hope to unveil next week." </TEXT>

<TEXT> TEL AVIV, Israel (AP)  U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis says the Pentagon will not disclose how much damage occurred when the military used its most powerful non-nuclear bomb to strike an Islamic State stronghold in Afghanistan.

The retired four-star Marine general says the Pentagon learned from its Vietnam war experience that it doesn't pay to judge the success of battlefield action in terms of the number of enemy forces killed. It was a reference to the so-called body count that was publicly exaggerated in Vietnam.

Instead, he says the April 13 use of the so-called "mother of all bombs" shows the U.S. doing "what was necessary to break ISIS," whether in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria or elsewhere.

Mattis was asked about the bombing by journalists traveling with him Thursday to Tel Aviv. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The most unsettling feeling among some at Fox News, however, is that Wednesdays events are only the beginning. Theres more to come, one Fox News insider told me, suggesting that there are more women with stories of harassment who have not come forward publicly. This estimation was affirmed by two people who heard such stories directly. Others are equally concerned about the attention that is being drawn to 21st Century Foxs handling of the allegations by women inside the company.


Rupert Murdoch spent part of Wednesday trying to allay fears within his organization. In an internal memo, he told his colleagues, Most importantly, we want to underscore our consistent commitment to fostering a work environment built on the values of trust and respect. But not everyone in the Fox News orbit is prepared to move forward just yet. Nancy Erika Smith, who represented Gretchen Carlson and Julie Roginsky in their suits against Ailes, appears willing to fight on. A couple of men close to retirement got pushed into retirement early with a whole lot of money, she said in a statement. Until Fox News releases every woman from confidentiality and arbitration agreements and until they get rid of the executives who enabled the harassment, the workplace will not be safe for women.

<TEXT> **Senator Elizabeth Warren:**

"What I think a big debate in Washington is about, is who is government going to work for, is it just going to work for the top, or is it actually gonna work for the rest of America?..."

"But the Russia thing, I put in a totally different category...That's the one that should not be partisan.  I don't care if you're a Democrat, if you're a Republican, if you're an Independent, if you're a Libertarian, I don't care: You should care whether or not Russia finagled our election, or otherwise, is calling any of the shots in Washington."


"Everybody should care, so let's start with what we absolutely know, for sure:"

"We know that the intelligence community of the United States of America said, Russia hacked in to American systems in order to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. **Pow!**"

"We know, for sure, that the FBI has an active and ongoing investigation about the ties between Russia and the Trump campaign and Donald Trump. **Wow!**"

"And we know, for sure, that top Trump aides, as you have just talked about, have been fired, because of their ties, their undisclosed ties and connections with Russia. **Now,** for me, that's is enough to say, we've got to have an investigation."


"We need a special prosecutor, with strong subpoena powers, and We need an independent commission, and All of us should want that. This is not about partisanship, this is about patriotism."

<TEXT> Even a handshake from the pope couldnt stop the inevitable.

Fox News has officially dropped Bill OReilly after sexual harassment allegations prompted protests outside network headquarters and a mass exodus from advertisers in recent days.

But amid the outcry, the accused predator is vacationing in Italy, where he briefly met Pope Francis on Wednesday.

OReilly sat in the VIP section during the pontiffs weekly general audience in St. Peters Square. The general audience is a free, public event that thousands of faithful attend every Wednesday. The VIP section where OReilly sat is situated beside the stage and is only accessible with special tickets distributed by the prefecture of the papal household.

Greg Burke, head of the Vatican press office and a former Fox correspondent, told Religion News Service he did not facilitate OReillys visit. But he did not specify who

"Among those who watch the show, 23 percent said they think it should be canceled, compared to 58 percent who said it should be kept on the network."


"The poll also found lower favorability ratings for O'Reilly. The Fox News host is viewed favorably by just 30 percent of Americans, down from 36 percent in a poll take earlier this month."

"His favorability rating among those who watch his show has fallen to 73 percent, down from 80 percent in the earlier poll."

<TEXT> With only six days remaining in Bill OReillys vacation, the pressure on the Murdoch family to decide the embattled commentators fate is intensifying. Three sources with knowledge of the discussions said that, while no final decision has been made, the Murdochs are leaning toward announcing that OReilly will not return to the air. Sons James and Lachlan have been arguing that OReilly needs to go, say these sources, though their father, Rupert, has resisted that outcome.


The prospect of dumping OReilly  once unimaginable  has gained steam this week due in part to street protests outside Fox News headquarters and advertiser boycotts on OReillys air. One network insider said Fox executives are alarmed by the severity of the ad-revenue decline. Its worse than Glenn Beck, the insider said, referring to the advertiser revolt that helped derail Becks Fox News career in 2011. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Hollywood Reporter:


Bill O'Reilly used to leer at an African-American Fox News clerical worker and called her "hot chocolate," according to attorney Lisa Bloom, who helped the woman report the harassment to the network's hotline.

The woman worked for a different broadcaster in 2008 while this was going on, but The O'Reilly Factor host's office was near her desk, the attorney claims. 

"He would never talk to her, not even hello, except to grunt at her like a wild boar," Bloom tells The Hollywood Reporter. "He would leer at her. He would always do this when no one else was around and she was scared."

Bloom says she spoke with three witnesses who knew the woman at the time and confirmed she was upset and stressed at the end of each workday. 

"She was afraid if she told him to knock it off shed get fired," Bloom says. "Now thats she's aware this is all in the news, shes decided to phone in a complaint to the Fox News hotline."

Bloom is also representing radio personality Wendy Walsh, who says she was forced out of the network after refusing O'Reilly's advances. 

An April 1 New York Times story revealed explosive allegations against O'Reilly, including that during his tenure at the network at least five women have been paid off to keep silent about harassment. In the story, Fox said in a statement that "no current or former Fox News employee ever took advantage of the 21st Century Fox hotline to raise a concern about Bill OReilly."

So far at least this woman and Walsh have taken advantage of the line  and, soon, another woman is also expected to call and report harassment by the anchor, according to Bloom. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **The Wrap:**

A womens group plans to lead a protest outside Fox News headquarters in New  York City on Tuesday, complete with a plane and a banner.


UltraViolet, which is an online community that seeks to fight sexism in corporations and the media, commissioned a plane to fly with a banner over the Hudson River, which will read Fox: #DropOReilly, The Sexual Predator.


The group also plans to hang posters around Midtown Manhattan, which ask, Have you also been sexually harassed by Bill? 



Fox News has a problem with sexual assault  and its bigger than just Bill OReilly, said Shaunna Thomas, co-founder of UltraViolet, in a Monday statement. Fox News needs to prove to the public  and its advertisers  that the era of covering up sexual assault is over. That means  firing Bill OReilly immediately and conducting a comprehensive and independent investigation into sexual abuse at the network  firing anyone involved in, or complicit in covering up, those crimes. </TEXT>

"In the past few weeks since The New York Times reported that O'Reilly and Fox News have allegedly paid $13 million to women who claimed that he sexually harassed or verbally abused them, several groups have boycotted and called for advertisers to drop The O'Reilly Factor."



"Ultraviolet has called for a boycott, and later published an open letter to 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch to fire O'Reilly, which read in part, "We are sexual assault and domestic violence survivors and their loved ones, writing once again to ask you to rid Fox News of its culture of gender-based abuse.""



"The group now has a protest planned for Tuesday, to be held at Fox News headquarters in New York, which includes a plane to fly a banner reading "Fox: #DropOReilly, The Sexual Predator"

The protest is set to begin Tuesday at 1:30 p.m. EST outside Fox News headquarters in New York.

<TEXT> The Washington Post:


Antiabortion advocates are on a roll right now, and theres less and less standing in their way

As part of the 'March for Life,' thousands of abortion opponents from across the country gathered in D.C. and marched from the Washington Monument to the U.S. Supreme Court with renewed optimism from an administration expected to move forward with antiabortion policies. 


President Trump just scored a political base victory by signing a law that allows states to withhold federal funds from Planned Parenthood and other facilities that provide abortions.


But the real movement on abortion is happening in the states. There, antiabortion advocates are on a roll, passing some of the most restrictive abortion laws ever. And with the winds shifting in Washington in favor of conservatives, some antiabortion advocates are banking that the ultimate prize  ending legal abortion  could be within reach.


There are now 17 states that ban abortion after 20 weeks, when antiabortion advocates argue a fetus can feel pain. In the 2017 state legislative session (which for many states isn't halfway over), five states have passed major abortion restriction laws, and 28 legislatures have introduced legislation banning some or all types of abortion.


Like it did last year, Arkansas is leading the pack. It has passed a flurry of antiabortion laws: One will require doctors to look into a woman's pregnancy history to make sure she isn't getting an abortion based on gender selection. Another will let husbands sue to prevent their wives from getting a second-trimester abortion. And the state banned the most common abortion procedures employed in the second trimester. (Similar bans have faced legal challenges in Kansas, Oklahoma and Alabama.)

A new law in Arizona will require doctors to resuscitate a fetus if it's born alive in an abortion procedure. It will also be one of the only states to require clinics have certain lifesaving equipment on hand.
Shortly after Republicans took control of the state House, which Democrats had held for nearly a century, Kentucky became the 17th state to ban all abortions at or after 20 weeks. Doctors also have to do an ultrasound on a woman who wants an abortion. Kentucky also just signed into law a bill taking away federal funds from Planned Parenthood, with a provision at the bottom that it would go into effect once Trump signed Thursday's bill.
Wyoming, which hasn't enacted an abortion restriction in nearly three decades, just signed into law a requirement that doctors offer a woman an ultrasound and an opportunity to listen to a fetal heartbeat during abortion counseling.
In Utah, abortion providers will soon have to counsel a woman wanting an abortion about a medically unproven procedure to undo it. (Despite the fact the top gynecology organization in America does not approve of this method, bills allowing for counseling about it was introduced in four other states.)


That's a lot of movement on abortion in a few months. But antiabortion advocates have actually been on a roll for six years and counting. Since Republicans swept control of a majority of state legislatures in 2010, states have enacted more than 350 abortion restrictions. In the 2016 state legislative session, some 14 states made it harder to get an abortion.





Antiabortion advocates have been so successful at restricting abortions that lawmakers are now coming up with some creative and eyebrow-raising ways to push the envelope.


A proposal that recently passed the Kansas state House requires a woman to receive her abortion information in black ink in 12-point Times New Roman font.


In Alabama, lawmakers are debating a constitutional amendment to ban abortion completely.


Since they haven't been able to stem the tide legislatively, abortion rights advocates have successfully been playing whack-a-mole through the courts. Many state laws banning abortion before or at 20 weeks end up getting held up or gutted in court, or GOP governors veto them to avoid such a fate.


With the landscape in Washington shifted to the right, however, court challenges might not be as much of a roadblock for antiabortion advocates.


Even with newly sworn in conservative Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, there are still five justices on the U.S. Supreme Court that have upheld abortion rights, including recently striking down Texas abortion clinic restrictions. But if some of the court's liberal or swing seats opened up during the Trump administration, that could change. Antiabortion advocates think it's feasible we could see a court in the next four to eight years that would be amendable to reversing its landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion.


Elizabeth Nash with the abortion rights research group Guttmacher Institute says there's an arms race in conservative states to pass increasingly strict abortion laws in hopes of being the trigger for a tidal wave of abortion bans.



Keeping up with politics is easy now.
One of these states are looking to be that state to enact the law that ends up at the Supreme Court and overturns Roe v. Wade, she said. That's what we're watching for.


Four states  Louisiana, Mississippi, and North and South Dakota  have laws in place that would immediately ban abortion if Roe v. Wade were overturned. A January report from the Center for Reproductive Rights calculates that abortion could quickly be illegal in 33 states if given the option.


In a 60 Minutes interview shortly after getting elected, President Trump seemed okay with that: Well, theyll perhaps have to go  theyll have to go to another state, he said of women who would want an abortion under that scenario.


Antiabortion advocates, like Mary Spalding Balch with the National Right to Life Committee, say the ultimate goal is ending all abortion: We still have a long way to go to achieve full protection of the unborn child, she told The Fix last year.


The trend is in that direction.

<TEXT> I think you provide the appropriate flushing out for what I simply stated.
 Besides Wendy Walsh, there are at least 7 women providing a situation where job was offered then sexual advances then no job. In the nytimes article and previously reported in court cases and witness testimony and reporting years back. Sure, more information is welcome as reporting and investigating continues, at this point I trust the stories of the women and the reporters reportings of the sexual harassment. It's not one story or one case. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bill O'Reilly offered several woman career furthering job opportunities at Fox News. Bill O'Reilly came on to these women, said sexual things to them, and wanted sex with them. Whatever the exact form, he made sexual advances and was rejected and the women were not given the career opportunities.

<TEXT> Bill O'Reilly implied to several different women they would have more opportunities at Fox News. Then, he tried come-ons with them, was overly and bluntly sexual with them, we do not know all the details, but we know he made unwanted sexual advances, and we know these women did not get the further job opportunities. It is likely there are more graphic situations and sexual harrassment cases we do not yet know about. But simply, being rejected and then not advancing the women is enough for firing him, his prior moralizing persona would agree. </TEXT>

<TEXT> PYONGYANG, North Korea (AP)--
"And in Pyongyang, where war would mean untold horrors, where neighborhoods could be reduced to rubble and tens of thousands of civilians could be killed, few people seem to care much at all."



"On Sunday, the city's zoo was crowded, playgrounds were full of children and families strolled along downtown sidewalks speckled with the falling blossoms of apricot trees. At the city's annual Kimilsungia flower show  held to celebrate Saturday's 105th anniversary of the birth of North Korea's founding ruler, Kim Il Sung, and the purple orchid named for him  thousands crowded around the displays, many using cellphones to take photos of friends and family."


"In a country where the propaganda is all-encompassing, and where the same family has held power for three generations, every display mixed bright flowers with reminders of Kim Il Sung or the nation that his grandson, Kim Jong Un, now rules. So there were dioramas of Kim Il Sung's birthplace, photos of him meeting foreign leaders, paintings of new housing developments  and models of missiles."



"And there was Chong Ok An, a retiree pushing her way through the crowds with her family."


""We're not afraid," she said. "As long as we have Marshall Kim Jong Un we can win any fight.""


"Her response reflected the phrasing of North Korean propaganda, as well as the reality that every person here has heard talk of war for decades. The Kim family has entrenched its rule by portraying the country as being relentlessly under siege, leaving its people unable to distinguish between daily hyperbole and the reality of an increasingly tense situation."


"The same unending hyperbole has affected South Koreans as well. They have heard North Korean warnings of their destruction for so long that the threats barely even register."


"While interest in North Korea spikes immediately after a missile launch, within hours internet search traffic is again dominated by TV comedy shows, taxes and real estate." </TEXT>

"**If thats true (and the Murdoch family has wisely hired the law firm Paul Weiss to investigate), theres only one way forward: OReilly must go."**


"Firing him is a huge step, but the Murdochs own history leaves them with little choice: In July, they established a precedent, terminating Ailes (with a $40 million spoonful of honey), based on similar accusations."

"That precedent could be critical in determining how they move forward. Not firing OReilly would lead to accusations of hypocrisy."

"Adding pressure to the Murdochs is their recent history with scandal, most notably the biggest one ever to strike their company, when reporters and editors at Londons News of the World were accused of wiretapping celebrities and other figures."

"Three years after phone-gate, they must convince investors that theyre their own men; that they can successfully guide their company into a future that may last even longer than its decades-old past. They must reassure prominent female employees (theyve promoted such top-level women as the Fox studios Stacey Snider and Emma Watts) that the old boys are no longer running rampant, whatever one might think.

<TEXT> In 1973 President Richard Nixon uttered a line that has since reverberated through the American psyche: "People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook." Well, we know what he said.


(Wait for laughter to subside)


But what you may not know, is that Nixon was not talking about the Watergate scandal, but about his decision to give into public pressure and release his tax returns. 

(Gasps)

Since then, every single American president has done the same until Donald Trump.

(Booing)


And the irony is, that our current president has more conflicts of interest, his businesses profiting, nepotism, foreign ties, than any of his predecessors.

(Applause)

Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code gives the House Ways and Means Committee the ability to requisition tax returns and release them when it serves the public interest and it is inarguable that seeing his taxes is in the public's best interest. Three Republicans from Texas on that committee, including Chairperson Kevin Brady!
(Gasps)

They can release Trump's tax returns and we need you, we need you, you (points finger) to put pressure on Mr. Brady. Failure to do so is an abdication of your civic duty.

The American people have got to know if their president is a crook.
(As they try to pull the microphone away from you scream:
Show us his taxes!

<TEXT> In 1973 President Richard Nixon uttered a line that has since reverberated through the American psyche: "People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook. Well," he said, "I am not a crook. 

Most Americans don't realize that Nixon was not talking about the Watergate scandal, but about his decision to succumb to the demand to release his tax returns. 

Since then, every single American president has done the same until Donald Trump.

And the irony is, that our current president has more conflicts of interest than any of his predecessors: whether it's bribery scandals in the Philippines, nepotism scandals in the White House, Mar-a-Lago doubling its membership fees, or any number of outstanding lawsuits against him for  possible violations of the emoluments clause of the American Constitution. 

It is imperative that the American people can be assured that their president, that Donald Trump, is not a crook

 and, it is impossible to do that, without seeing his tax returns.

Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code gives the House Ways and Means Committee the ability to requisition tax returns and release them when it, quote: serves the public interest." Considering the longstanding precedent, and all of Trump's potential conflicts, wouldn't seeing his taxes serve the public's *best* interests?

There are three Republican congressmen from Texas on the Ways   Means committee, including its Chairperson Kevin Brady. They have the power to acquire and release President Trump's tax returns and We need you to put pressure on Mr. Brady, and the others, to deliver what the president swore he would release months ago. Failure to do so is an abdication of your civic duty.

The American people have the right to know if their president is a crook, show us his taxes! </TEXT>

"Look, its open season, he said, visibly irritated, when asked about a recently published book by Megyn Kelly, his colleague at the time. In the book, Ms. Kelly provided an account of being sexually harassed by Roger Ailes, the networks former chairman. Later Mr. OReilly added, Lets whack the Fox News Channel. Ive had enough of it. Its a good place to work. All right?"


"The comments set off a media firestorm and frustrated Ms. Kelly, who sent an email to Fox News executives complaining about his behavior and the chilling effect it could have on women at the company and beyond, according to four people with knowledge of the email who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters."


"Despite Ms. Kellys complaint, and a plea from a producer that Mr. OReilly not be allowed to make similar remarks on his prime-time show, Mr. OReilly delivered a second public scolding on the program that night."


"If you dont like whats happening in the workplace, go to human resources or leave, he said."


"That experience, along with a deep skepticism about whether the network was truly committed to changing its culture after Mr. Ailes was forced out, was a factor in Ms. Kellys decision to leave Fox News for a new role at NBC News, according to two people familiar with the matter.""

<TEXT> "His absence has not made advertisers hearts grow fonder. Even with Dana Perino hosting Factor on Wednesday and Eric Bolling leading the program on Thursday, the show has featured approximately 10 national commercials each night. In the month prior to the disclosure of the settlements, OReillys program carriedan average of 33 national ads totaling more than 14 minutes, according to Kantar, a tracker of ad spending."


"Some of the Madison Avenue scatter from OReillys show may be more for show than for real. The advertisers appear to be using a tactic that is common when Madison Avenue wishes to avoid negative publicity associated with a particular program, but in fact likes the results derived from advertising on the network that shows it. Marketers decision to keep money at Fox News suggests some of them may be waiting to see if a return is possible."


"Even so, those defections ought to be taken seriously. In mid-2015, marketers including General Mills, Yum Brands Pizza Hut, PepsiCos Pure Leaf Iced Tea, Choice Hotels and Crayola LLC all publicly stated they had removed their commercials from 19 Kids and Counting, a TLC reality show that spotlighted the Duggar family, in light of news that the oldest boy in the family had sexually assaulted teenage girls. But none of the sponsors pulled their ad dollars previously earmarked for TLC or other properties owned by its parent, Discovery Communications. The show was eventually canceled"


"A network can keep any series on the air it chooses  if it has the willpower. In 2008, a handful of sponsors pulled out of Swingtown, a CBS drama that examined spouse-swapping in the 1970s, among its other elements. The network filled its advertising holes with direct-response ads for Time-Life 1970s music compilations, and soldiered on."

<TEXT> (CNN): "Now that Neil Gorsuch has taken his seat as the 113th Supreme Court justice, his judicial life is going to change in many ways. One striking difference is he will no longer be subject to a written ethics code, as he was as a judge on the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals..."


"Members of Congress have repeatedly called on the justices to adopt an ethics code. Most recently, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, and Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-New York, introduced the Supreme Court Ethics Act of 2017, which would give the court six months to "promulgate a code of ethics" based on the Code of Conduct for US Judges already in effect for the lower federal courts..."


**"Instead, the objective of a code would be to set discernible standards for the justices' conduct so that the public could know the norms to which the justices are holding themselves."**



"Is it acceptable for justices to speak at charitable fund-raisers or to solicit contributions? To vacation with litigants during pending proceedings? To comment on legal issues or cases pending in other courts? To accept gifts from political activists or to criticize candidates for office? All of these events have occurred and others -- such as providing anonymous leaks to the press -- have been suspected. Although the public may consider certain conduct problematic or unethical, there is no authoritative statement from the court itself about limits on the conduct of the individual justices."

"Despite Ms. Kellys complaint, and a plea from a producer that Mr. OReilly not be allowed to make similar remarks on his prime-time show, Mr. OReilly delivered a second public scolding on the program that night."

"If you dont like whats happening in the workplace, go to human resources or leave, he said."

"That experience, along with a deep skepticism about whether the network was truly committed to changing its culture after Mr. Ailes was forced out, was a factor in Ms. Kellys decision to leave Fox News for a new role at NBC News, according to two people familiar with the matter.""

<TEXT> *Dan Rather, host of The Big Interview on AXS Tv, talks with Rachel Maddow about how Donald Trump's actions are being perceived by Americans and around the world, and what is motivating those actions.* 


***A big difference between evolution and confusion***



**Dan Rather:**  "Donald Trump sold himself, one reason he got elected, was he presented himself as a person he doesn't back down, he doesn't back up, he doesn't turn around. Well, since he's been in office, that's practically the main thing he has done; back up, back down, turn around...everything from Chinese money manipulation, to his opinion of NATO and the federal reserve, you read part of the list, but the list is longer than my arm."


*Rachel's 2 minute List from [MSNBC YouTube Erratic Donald Trump Unbeholden To Past Declarations](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kuh_Dd9Xwqs)
 

"He's jumping around like grease on a hot skillet, now, unpredictability can be an important part of leadership, but being erratic, and coming across as confused, to not knowing not only what you believe, but where you want to go. For example, it's one thing to drop all these tomahawks, 59 tomahawks on Syria, well to what purpose? What is the strategy? What is the overarching strategy in Syria?"


"...What concerns me, and concerns a lot of people Rachel, these two bombings, the Syria Tomahawks and the Afghanistan bombings, let me make clear, as one off military operations I have no argument with that. But with those, the, I'll call the Beltway Class in Washington, and some other people around the country, who are cheering the president's military posturing, you might want to call it positioning."

"Now, we know it's a fact, that president Trump, more than some Presidents at least, he basks in admiration. That raises the question, since he's been getting some pretty good press about dropping these bombs in these places, and a concern, that he'll base his decisions, war and peace decisions in North Korea and other places, on the fact, *you know what, I've been getting some pretty good press the past ten days.*" </TEXT>

Of the 1,000 respondents (all frequent news consumers, split 50-50 between Trump and Clinton supporters), 24 percent said they felt "very unfavorable" toward O'Reilly.*

*At 20 percent of respondents, Sean Hannity ranked as the second-most-unfavorably viewed news personality. Megyn Kelly and Rachel Maddow both tied at 17 percent "very unfavorable" responses, and Brian Williams was viewed very unfavorably by 14 percent.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is actually extremely well said, and really sums up the legalize argument very efficiently. I inititialy responded to each individual point, but your argument does not rely on individual points, but all four points at once.  

I think, (and I'm not sure,) it is not a bad idea to take on the "pot makes you lazy and aloof* debate, to allow the legalize debate to be framed that way with the pushback to that argument you have given. 

I also think, there's that argument, that when you suddenly legalize something(and it's not that sudden anymore) that because the education is behind and the experience is less, that you will at first have more incidents of stupidness, or the appearence of more stupidness, due to the legal accessible pot at first...of course as the people catch up the education/experience that after not long the incidents are less than when illegal. And, again, your 4 points are the argument against "*stoners equals more stupid accidents.*" </TEXT>

I certainly was not sumarizing the video I shared with that statement; it was an after thought pointing out that Bernie is wearing a sweater and not a business suit and tie, that sweaters are chill, what's wrong with that? I'm not trying to make a large all encompassing statement, but why can't *progressives wear sweaters* be a slogan that means a certain "political professional attire" is not necessary to run for office? I'm not saying it's the best or most important point to make, I just dig the Bernie sweater in this video. </TEXT>

So watch not for the decline of Bannon, but for the decline of Bannonism.**"


"Whats Bannonism? The former Breitbart editor opposes broad international trade agreements and favors an adversarial relationship between the Trump administration and the news media, as well as between the administration and the federal bureaucracy. He wants very tough policies on illegal immigration, has called for limiting refugees from the Middle East from coming to the U.S., and has expressed deep concerns about the rise of Islam, both at home and abroad." </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Audio: Fresh Air with Terry Gross:**

*With the Federalist Society, Leonard Leo has reared a generation of originalist lites. The selection of Neil Gorsuch is just his latest achievement.*

"New Yorker staff writer Jeffrey Toobin discusses Leonard Leo, the conservative lawyer who is responsible, to a considerable extent, for one third of the justices on the Supreme Court."

Toobin discuss his New Yorker Article, [THE CONSERVATIVE PIPELINE TO THE SUPREME COURT](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/17/the-conservative-pipeline-to-the-supreme-court)

Toobin writes:
 "No one remembers who John Hancock was, Gorsuch said. But they know that thats a signature because he wrote his name so bigly... Gorsuchs invocation of one of Donald Trumps trademark utterances, apparently accidental, prompted an explosion of laughter from the audience."

<TEXT> **Audio: Fresh Air with Terry Gross:**

*With the Federalist Society, Leonard Leo has reared a generation of originalist lites. The selection of Neil Gorsuch is just his latest achievement.*

"New Yorker staff writer Jeffrey Toobin discusses Leonard Leo, the conservative lawyer who is responsible, to a considerable extent, for one third of the justices on the Supreme Court."

Toobin discuss his New Yorker Article, [THE CONSERVATIVE PIPELINE TO THE SUPREME COURT](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/17/the-conservative-pipeline-to-the-supreme-court)

Toobin writes:
 "No one remembers who John Hancock was, Gorsuch said. But they know that thats a signature because he wrote his name so bigly . . . Gorsuchs invocation of one of Donald Trumps trademark utterances, apparently accidental, prompted an explosion of laughter from the audience."

But when someting is already illegal, it's already in that moderated system, you can't exactly use that same logic to undue it. if you saying everything should if could be moderated, you might not be able to add everything that is bad to it, but what is there you wouldn't take it out persay.

"The report also forecasts that tax revenues in states with legalized marijuana will reach $1.8 billion, of which $1.4 billion will be from cannabis specific taxes. **This money isn't easily replaceable if the Department of Justice reviews its current approach to marijuana.

*ox News host Bill O'Reilly took to his show on Monday to weigh in on an incident involving a passenger that has rocked United Airlines.*

*After playing the clip of a male passenger being forcibly removed by aviation police officers Sunday from United flight 3411, O'Reilly chuckled as he said to Fox News correspondent Rob Schmitt, "I shouldn't be laughing, but it's just so bizarre."*

*"They had to get some United Airlines personnel from Chicago to Louisville ... they had to get them there and so they asked for volunteers, and obviously, this guy didn't volunteer," continued O'Reilly as he laughed.*

*Toward the end of the segment, O'Reilly seemed to take a more serious tone. "Can't have this kind of stuff, it looks like a police state," he said.*

<TEXT> "A judge considering Arkansas' unprecedented plan to execute seven inmates over 11 days before its supply of an execution drug expires has had a hand in key decisions on several social issues in the state."

"Judge Kristine Baker, who was appointed to U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas by President Barack Obama, ruled in 2014 that Arkansas' gay marriage ban was unconstitutional. A year later, she blocked an Arkansas law that would have restricted the use of abortion pills."

"Arkansas, which hasn't executed anyone since 2005, is preparing to execute seven inmates before its supply of midazolam expires at the end of the month. Baker is considering the legality of that plan this week."

**Baker must rule whether the state's plan to execute seven prisoners from April 17 through April 27 would violate their rights to meaningful counsel and access to the courts.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Neil Gorsuchs confirmation to the Supreme Court was made possible in part by the Judicial Crisis Network, which spent $17 million lobbying to keep Merrick Garland off the benchand to get Gorsuch on it. Where did all that money come from? We dont know, because it was almost entirely dark money, funneled through a Koch-allied conduit that keeps its donors secret. But the JCN isnt entirely anonymous: It has a public face in Carrie Severino, the groups chief counsel and policy director. Severino essentially served as Gorsuchs lobbyist, throwing money around to ensure his confirmation. Like many lobbyists, she enjoys the access to power that her job affords her. Indeed, Severino attended Gorsuchs swearing-in ceremony at the White House Rose Garden on Monday morning.* </TEXT>

micah: So is it helpful for Democrats to look for a scapegoat? Or, more generously, to spend a lot of time sifting through the causes of Clintons loss?

clare.malone: Causes of loss, of course.

Let us state for the record here  history has proved that scapegoating feels good in the short term, but will screw you up in the long term.

**and** you are naive if you think Jill Stein would/should/could get no votes or that people that voted for her woulda/shoulda/coulda have all voted for Hillary. Duh, more people should have voted Hillary, period, duh.

The number of people who did not vote is way more important than blaming **Fuck Gorsuch** on third parties. And we aren't talking election, we talking **Fuck Gorsuch** </TEXT>

Republicans birthed and molded this ideological conservative court, and lied and conned their way to **Justice Fuck Gorsuch**. Jill Stein or whoever will get more votes next time so it ain't about those votes. 

And, Yes Senators matter; fuck Gorsuch, fuck Republicans, fuck conservatism. . </TEXT>

"The justices will hear arguments in Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer April 19. The case asks to the Court to decide whether churches and faith-based organizations may be excluded from neutral, secular aid programs administered by state governments."

"Though the state provides funding for such projects at secular institutions, it denied Trinity Lutheran a grant because it is a religious entity."

"During a conference Thursday, the justices will decide whether to hear a religious liberty challenge involving a Colorado baker who refused to make a cake for a same-sex wedding, as well as a case concerning the right of gun-owners to carry firearms outside the home....a Second Amendment controversy arising from California, would be the biggest gun-rights decision in several years...**Should the justices take the case and side with the activists, they could announce a constitutionally-protected right to bear firearms outside the home for the first time in American history.**" </TEXT>

<TEXT> This video better addresses yesterday's tweet story:

**Trump administration told Russia about its war plans before they told the U.S. Congress.**


I did not care for language of that tweet yesterday and replied thus(and a reply to my reply):

*Again fun tweet but more important questions are:*

*Why did Trump not ask Congress before strike?*

*Did Trump contact Putin or did U.S. contact Russia with a broader agreement about attack opposed to just a warning to avoid casualties?*


*Did they give a fair warning to the people that were killed? And who was killed?*

*Did the ground troops and base deserve a fair warning?*

/u/DiscoConspiracy:

*And was the strike effective? Did it accomplish a goal beyond just destroying/damaging the airfield, and is the effectiveness of that goal being followed up*


I believe this 15 minute video appropriately covers the point of the tweet and the additional questions needed to be asked.

<TEXT> "**The Ryan bill took a diabolical new tack, going after insurers instead of clinics or providers.** Under the now-dead plan, women enrolled in any insurance plan that covers abortion would not have been eligible for the federal tax credits designed to shave premium costs. A final version did make an exception in cases of rape or incest, or if the abortion is needed to save the womans life. But if enacted, the measure would have effectively eliminated private insurance coverage of abortion, further limiting the procedure to women wealthy enough to pay for it out of pocket."



"With that approach dead for now, and since Trump seems to have ruled out prosecuting women, physicians could well be the target of anti-abortion lawmakers."


"Criminalizing the procedure will saddle individual doctors, whether in private practice or prestigious university teaching hospitals, with a miserable dilemma  serve their frantic patients or risk their professional livelihood. Violating the law would be hard under any circumstances; for younger doctors still paying off steep medical school loans, the financial consequences could be ruinous."

"Older doctors, particularly those who trained in the pre-Roe years, say they still shudder recalling women who were mutilated or died following back-alley or self-induced abortions, and they are determined to continue providing care. As these older practitioners retire, younger ob-gyns have taken up the challenge of training new abortion providers." </TEXT>

"This acknowledgement should have come as a relief to many, particularly as the team of people with whom I work at the National Center for Lesbian Rights helped bring this case to the Supreme Court. However, it is cold comfort because after a slew of carefully worded answers, **Gorsuch refused to affirm the legal reasoning underlying the courts interpretation of constitutional protections for the LGBTQ community. Gorsuch has also endorsed the view that religious beliefs can justify discrimination, even when others are harmed.** A vote to confirm Gorsuch would jeopardize the LGBTQ communitys hard-won achievement of basic freedom and constitutional rights." </TEXT>

/u/Dr_Ghamorra:
This alone should be grounds for impeachment. He's basically engineering security and intelligence groups to go after his opponents. This is why I think these groups should be managed entirely by a non-partisan body. A vindictive president in control these powerful groups is worrying.


Reply subject1702:
The best part of these Maddow reports on Russia are that they don't need conjecture or exaggeration to point to Russian-Trump coordination; it may not be collusion yet, but the baseline for evidence and further investigation is already here

I conceded that it was boring and overhyped; and given you the reason why she still has all credibility: because she never lied or misled. It wasn't perfect but the backlash is a conservative subversion, help your liberal friends understand the bigger picture, explain how Fox News would present two pages of new boring Hillary Taxes they just got.

<TEXT> You are correct on one point: only conservatives are still complaining about Maddow's 2005 tax report and if you can't easily defend Rachel against this attack, you are no liberal. Say it was boring or say it was overhyped, but to imply she lied or even mislead from the truth is to simply tarnish a great reporter. 

Conservative's complaint about Maddow is like Conservatives telling Democrats to wait until next time for the filibuster; it is a subversive arguement intended to impede the progressive cause as it does nothing to help the Conservative cause only slow liberals down. Conservatives aren't supposed to like Maddow and they never have, duh! </TEXT>

<TEXT> When you treat Reddit comments as news, I guess these things can happen. But, just like you might suddenly realize another user who seems to agree with you is actually placating and planting their own angle, there's only so much Russian news you can spread before you realize the news is also helping Russia or fits into the arguments of the Russia subreddit. So if they didn't know at first, they knew before they stopped. The aides would have figured it out eventually and then Trump would have figured it out eventually; before they stopped spreading Russian propaganda they must have known it was helping Trump and Putin simultaneously. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Rachel Maddow reviews a list of less reported but no less outrageous current Trump administration scandals and notes that beyond the big Trump Russia scandal, Americans have to retain their ability to be shocked by corruption if the U.S is to remain* an ethical Democracy, as the Russia scandal may not be the scandal to end this presidency.


**Rachel begins:** "You know, there's basically a menu of scandal to choose from, not like a Waffle House menu, where it's picture based, and there's not all that many choices, so you just point at the things you want, and how many you want on your plate. It's not that kind of menu. The scandal menu right now is one of those binders, tons of pages, too many choices, and you can't narrow it down."

"Start anywhere!"

**Summary of Rachel's scandal menu:**

1. Karl Icahn-Recommended to kill a regulation that rewarded his own company 209 million dollars and Trump kept a regulation(while deleting others) that protected a company of which Icahn has 82% ownership 

2. Scott Pruit- Having his law license reviewed by the state of Oklahoma because he lied at Senate Hearing that he did not do business on his government email; he did do.

3. Alabama Gov Bently to be impeached next week

4. Arkansas killing 8 men in 10 days, 4 double header executions back to back using drugs they have never used before 

5. Botched Trump admin Yemen raid investigation: Risky at Start, Costly at End

6. U.S. Military also investigating Trump admin Mosul bombing where reportedly U.S. dropped leaflets telling people to stay in their home, than U.S. may have dropped bombs on homes reportedly killing 200 civilians

7+ All the self-dealing 

8+ and conflicts of interest

9+ The President appointing his children to high ranking sensitive govt. positions 

10+ Whether Trump is profiting from the presidency

11+ If Trump businesses receiving payments from foreign governments 

And Russia Russia Russia..

(+indicates a scandal item that includes more than one scandal, dessert)

**Rachel on** ***if Russia isn't the scandal that brings down Trump:***


"Before now, any one of these scandals would be nationally riveting, would be a source of seething outrage, if not bipartisan outrage, than at least partisan outrage. But in this new American era, what we're doing instead is sorta cataloging that stuff in the background, assuming we'll get to it at some point."

"But in the meantime, what we've been doing everyday is watching the unfolding of the one Trump scandal that seems existential.  The one Trump scandal that it seems like, might undue this Presidency by revealing this presidency as basically the product of a crime, at least the product of a foreign actor acting with American confederates."


"But I just want to plant the flag here: There remains the possibility that the president and his campaign are innocent."


"There remains the possibility that the president and his campaign are not innocent but that this scandal does not prove to an existential presidency ending conflagration, even if they are found to have committed very bad acts..."


"There remains the possibility at the end of all of it, he's still President."


**"And then, for the sake of our Democracy, we have to figure out how we are going to regain our intolerance for corruption and scandal, and throwing our American ethical and political norms out the window.  One of the consequences already of the Russian attack and its aftermath, is what would otherwise be presidency ending scandals in any other administration are like page 15, man, if you get there."**

***There has to be consequences for*** **the scandal menu!**  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because a first reaction to a 20 week ban on abortion might be..*well ya, that's pretty far along, how many women are doing that?* And that would be a fairly accurate observation as Planned P points out: "Nearly 99% percent of abortions occur before 21 weeks." *hmm, so why are the 1% of women getting abortions after 21 weeks?*: "but when they are needed later in pregnancy, its often in very complex circumstances  the kind of situations where a woman and her doctor need every medical option available."  And that's a pretty solid fast answer for starters. </TEXT>

"I have a simple question: **What the heck are you thinking?** What is in your mind! Why would you want to give out any of your personal information to a faceless corporation for the sole purpose of them selling it!? Give me one good reason why Comcast should know what my mother's medical problems are, you know how they'd know, because when I went to the doctor with her and they told me what it was, I had no clue what they were talking about, I came home and I searched it on the net, I searched the drugs she was taking. The same with my children. **Just last week, I bought underwear on the Internet, Why should you know what size I take?"**

Why would you want to give out any of your personal information to a faceless corporation for the sole purpose of them selling it!? Give me one good reason why Comcast should know what my mother's medical problems are, you know how they'd know, because when I went to the doctor with her and they told me what it was, I had no clue what they were talking about, I came home and I searched it on the net, I searched the drugs she was taking. The same with my children. **Just last week, I bought underwear on the Internet, Why should you know what size I take?**"

And Mr. Nunes is holding up the proceeding so let's get the public MORE involved with MORE information so there is MORE pressure for the full investigation to proceed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's counterintuitive to the arguement being made about abortion rights. I gave you a clear argument of what I mean and you did not reply to any of it. Do not conflate abortion rights and pro-gun rights. You can make another point about guns but to say "this article missed the point because of guns" is antithetical to the point being made, so what do you think of my explanation of abortion not being a polarized issue up for debate, particularly for all democrats to take that stance?

   On the issue of gun rights, perhaps that is something Dems should do to bring in the moderate right. I don't want people who shouldn't have guns illegally for crimes to have lots of guns and I don't want bullets flying around from guns people legally or illegally own, but I am no longer confident arguing with the 2nd ammemdmnt will do anything to prevent gun violence. It is true that the guns people own to protect themselves are more likely to hurt or kill someone they know than to protect themselves and it is unclear how to minimize that statistic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hear that, I was saying with that in mind and even if the administration is building Spicer up to fail and be thrown under the bus, using him as a pawn, it doesn't change that I'm looking forward to his firing. But to your point, yes, part of me wants it over and I want them to release this human being from his hardened position as I feel bad for all uncomfortable humans. But, also, I don't think either one of us can be sure he won't end up with a Fox News job...So, I don't empathize with Sean or the position he has put himself in, sure it is sad though  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello my name is *blank* and I live in your *blank.* I heard that former acting attorney general Sally Yates has information concerning Russia's involvement in the 2016 election, particularly regarding Micheal Flynn's potential treason, and intelligence committee ranking member Congressman Adam Schiff requested Sally Yates share this important and vital information with the public, and I was wondering, as my representative, what you will do to ensure I hear this and Sally Yates testifies in a public hearing? 
Because I am very concerned that congressmen David Nunes and the Trump administration is trying to stop the public from hearing her testimony, and I need to know my country is in safe hands. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bernie was pretty directly asked about being more open to anti-abortion and he said yes. Before I read this, Sanders came off poorly to me when I heard it and he at least needs to clarify because he did say yes without elaborating. And the writer goes on to point to the fact that Dems have historically moved to the right on what they consider polarized issues, where as the writer points out that abortion rights are not a "polarized issue" and calling it "polarized" is a male perspective that men see amoung men. Among women it is not a "polarized opinion" meant for debate; it is a human's right to their body.  As the Democrats decide how to respond to the loss, every right is up for grabs, anything can be labeled too liberal (as she also pointed to an nytimes article urging Dems to move right) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Last 3 minutes, Bernie on Climate Change:

"Right, Mica, that's a 6-hour discussion. It's...it's...I don't know what adjective to use."

"You have a president that tells the world, in his *view,* after intensive studying, he has concluded, unlike the rest of the science community that climate change is a hoax, emanating from China."

"And what he has done appointing the people he has appointed is a danger, a horrific danger, not only to our generation, but to our children and our grandchildren."

**""Hey, Mr. President, listen to the scientists, Climate Change is real,** it is already causing devastating problems to our country and around the world. And if we don't transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, coal, oil, gas, into energy efficiency and sustainable energy I worry very much about the planet the future generations will inherit."

"By the way, despite Trump's rhetoric there, the corporate world understands the future is sustainable energy, most of the new investments are going into solar which is exploding all over our country and the world, and into wind and solar. **What this guy is doing is really an international embarrassment and endangering the future of our country**

<TEXT> I see, but they are still splitting profit by getting all profit from their Sony two movies and Marvel getting all money from their 2+ movies.  So that when it comes to the 5th and 6th movies, Sony will want both.

Sounds like Sony and Disney are splitting the Sony movie merchandise, and Disney owns the image but they would maybe get a smaller percentage from Venom merch for example? more like a rental fee, so they d get less from a future Spider-Man movie merch, although it all boost all Spider-Man products which Disney owns..? </TEXT>

Regardless of what one might say of Sony's Andrew Garfield they were happy to sell us on him and then disappear him, with all the build up they laid on us. It's that profit share, maybe they just want more and even the venom movie verse  is a ploy for more Spidey's shares, but more likely Amy pascal's bosses want the whole pie with the added hype of the MCU. It seemed like Pacal didn't mean to get into it maybe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As I just implied, Garland was the Most Conservative Judge you should be able to get from a Democrat, and that is why Republicans wanted him the most. Gorsuch is not a compromise like Garland. Sure I can see how conservatives will always feel a democrats pick is too liberal, vice versus to some degree, but no, Garland was closer to center than Gorsuch, Democrats and supporters would have reacted different to a more moderate nomination  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Picture IDs do not prevent voter fraud; and that may sound surprising, but we can be identified with various factoids. Recently, they said Mail-in ballots in Michigan would be legit (and would also increase turnout!) i.e. you don't need a picture. In Texas, right now, they are tying to enforce needing a picture ID to vote, a picture ID is usually a drivers license, and poor people for example in Texas don't have a car or can't pay the money for a state ID or can't get to the state ID office without a car because it's too far to get to. Texas Republicans use these "Voter Fraud" rules to inflict voter fraud, actually suppressing poor minorities who generally vote for Democrats. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Is North Carolina a Preview of Whats to Come?*

"The election of a Democratic governor last year directly challenged the ability of the Republican-controlled General Assembly to defend a suite of voter disenfranchisement tactics that has been called a monster law.


For traditionally purple North Carolina, this fight represents a willingness by the GOP to abandon any vestige of bipartisanship in accepting the will of the electorate.


One can argue that the roadmap for the national Republicans to permanently consolidate power is being tried out in North Carolina  particularly in light of calls by the president to investigate alleged voter fraud.


By 2055, the United States will be far more ethnically diverse; no single race will make up more than 50 percent of the population. The country also is growing more liberal by the year, placing increasing pressure on conservatives to find ways to stay at the table. Many politicians have embraced undemocratic tactics in order to stay in power.


The right to vote is our most fundamental right, said North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, who, in February, filed a motion with the U.S. Supreme Court to dismiss the petition to appeal the overturning of the 2013 voting restrictions package.
The NC General Assembly has responded to this call with a petition of its own to the Supreme Court, seeking to disqualify Stein from the case.


While the situation in North Carolina can be construed as a consequence of the hollowing of the Voting Rights Act, the North Carolina case is really a study in gerrymandering and how this winners-take-all approach to governance has managed to turn a demographically purple state into one that is solidly red. It is also a warning to the rest of the nation that  left unchecked  aggressive gerrymandering can, and will, be the end of American democracy."



And then the article really dives into North Carolina voting rights recent diminishing.

<TEXT> Yes I do blame the Republican congress. But it does seem those states took the ruling as an opportunity to push new voting restrictions, which is probably why it was passed or diminished by 5 conservative leaning judges yes, 4 liberal leaning judges no. Perhaps your "bad precedent" holds to a degree(although precedent seems interpretable to the context), but there is a precedent to replace before you repeal.  </TEXT>

"The effects are already being felt. Ballard Sphar LLP said: The demise of Section 4 has had and will continue to have substantial effects. Mere hours after the Court issued its decision, Texas announced that it would activate its controversial voter ID law and possibly the redistricting maps passed by the Texas legislature. The North Carolina legislature has also indicated its plan to enact a statute...that requires voters to present state-issued photo ID to vote.

Sounds like they should have just left it as it was, obviously the Republican majority doesn't want to update it, I still maintain. </TEXT>

Seems like the court striking down the "punishing" of states part, which just means the slowing of enacting law by needing to get approval, is the Republican victory, so until the Democrats take the house, no Republican wants new restrictions on states? The Dems will probably try to tag it to some other bill. Cornyn don't care about equal rights, he said it was equal enough.

<TEXT> Ya I was just using the FBI investigation as an example. Sure, everyone does this, I heard your point, I don't think you heard mine though, I'm not saying it's easy, I'm saying it is coming to a point where ideological narratives will not succeed in allowing a person to blindly follow one inconsistent story after another, yes this will always exist in some form, but I feel a change is coming where there will be more personal individual ideology, more parties perhaps is the physical realization of that. And with that, there will be a way to speak to eachother with different views, where a person can more easily change a mind. There is something about BrightBert that is new, there's a tone, and there is something about that tone that makes me think something better to counter that tone is coming soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree, I think minds can be moved away from conspiracy theories more than 1 out of 10. And I think while those websites are presenting a very clear and cohesive narrative, where each story reinforces a larger idea and builds upon a single minded ideology, I think they can be countered by other narratives, and eventually this single-minded person would pick and choose from different narratives and instead of building a singular narrative with these pieces, they will have many unique personal narratives i.e. A liberal! So while idealolgy allows a Trump supporter to see an FBI investigation as fine for Trump and bad for Hillary, one might imagine that the Trump/Republican ideological narrative is chipping away at itself as inconsistency mounts and explanations split people off in several different directions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 
*Neil Gorsuch's confirmation to the Supreme Court would reboot a 25-year campaign to chip away at abortion rights.*


**Whilst I am the liberalist of liberals, this article is for all sides:**


"The landmark ruling that advocates on both sides of the abortion debate should focus on isnt Roe but its 1992 revision of sorts, *Planned Parenthood v. Casey."*


**And here are some select quotes I pulled highlighting that the FREE CHOICE of ABORTION is at risk if GORSUCH is confirmed:**


""The trouble was that Casey didnt define undue burden other than as a regulation with the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion. It didnt specify what constituted a substantial obstacle."


"In June, with just eight justices, the Supreme Court finally clarified its undue burden rule when it decided *Whole Womans Health vs. Hellerstedt.* In a 5-3 vote, the court found that a Texas law requiring doctors at abortion clinics to have hospital-admitting privileges was not medically necessarymany riskier medical procedures, like colonoscopies, did not come with these requirementsand therefore posed undue burdens.

The decision was largely seen by legal scholars as a win for reproductive rights activistsone that placed limits on what could be considered an undue burden under *Casey.* But when future Supreme Court cases about abortion restrictions arise, as they inevitably will, a more conservative court may define undue burdens differently.""


[BUT...]


"A *Roe* reversal is possible. Former Chief Justice William Rehnquist made no secret of his desire to do away with it, and Scalia, in his Casey dissent, argued that it should be overturned, writing that since the Constitution doesnt mention abortion specifically it should be up to states to decide. 

Like Scalia, Gorsuch is whats known as a legal textualist, interpreting the law based on the words as written, not their perceived intent...If Trump appointed enough justices like himin theory, he might need just one more appointment and the right case came up, the court could conceivably follow Scalias original line of thinking and overturn *Roe."*


"In theory, *Whole Womans Health* has made it harder for states to pass abortion restrictions, but the political climatea president who vows to try to overturn *Roe,* a Congress poised to defund Planned Parenthoodmay embolden state lawmakers seeking to limit it. Were waiting to see what the legislatures do in the various states, says Crepps." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have this issue on one subreddit where like ten different names say similar things that all build to one coherent corrupt idea, one that would seem nonsensical in reality, but within the context they have created, logical enough. Is it one person or ten unique individuals? Eventually, after you realize you are just trolling trolls, you start to see where sincerity lies and how to be real while being anonymous. Unfortunately, the subconscious effects of their propaganda probably corrupt my opinions nevertheless. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, it is particularly noteworthy how they hit the Dem vs Dem  Florida primary, on that smaller scale it is easier to see the effect that  the negative attacks on both Democrats in the Primary led to the Republican win in the General. 


Then compare that to Bernie vs Hillary where it is harder to see whether the noise is coming from a liberal or a conservative or a fake Russian Hacker.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What follows in the Esquire article after the "being sore" quote is that Evans is having a tough time fitting in his own movie projects, as he was worried he would when he first signed the six-picture Marvel deal instead of a 9-picture deal. 
From [Esquire:](http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a53656/chris-evans-fights-back/)

"Back in 2010, Marvel presented Evans with a nine-picture deal. He insisted he'd sign on for no more than six. Some family members thought he was nuts to dial back such a secure and lucrative gig. Evans saw it differently.



It takes five months to shoot a Marvel movie, and when you tack on the promotional obligations for each one, well, shit, man. Evans knew that for as long as he was bound to Captain America, he would have little time to take on other projects. He wanted to direct, he wanted to play other charactersroles that were more humanlike the lead in Gifted, which will hit theaters this month. The script had brought him to tears. Evans managed to squeeze the movie in between Captain America and Avengers films." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Downy says he's out and then in and then out and then in. I think Evans has stuck to this similar out after avengers 3/4. Probably better to follow new characters than new actors playing same characters at first. Then multi-verse.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you're wrong and right. Is this the most important story? No. Should it be a top 50 post from yesterday? Probably. Is it in the top 500 important stories of the week? Maybe not.  I did a post on Spicer every briefing this week using a picture and a quote and those were probably more worthy topics. I was watching Friday's press briefing, his pin was upside down, seemed noteworthy and comical and disorganized so I went for it. Unbeknownst to me 1000s of professional newspersons were doing the same story. The "Professionals" should probably not be pining all over this story, but it should probably be on the front page of ETS amoung the more informative posts of the day.  I probably should have included a *worthy dumb Spicer quote* that pointed to an administration flaw so that the attention this post got informed more as well, but I do think my phrasing is informative to the EnoughTrump narrative. And, I sincerely believe, this could be the last straw before Trumpo fires Spice Man. And, it's funny, and, I'm just working on presenting stories in this format, and why things catch hits I do not really know.  Like it's not a link, I made this story up, isn't that neat? And none of the stories I saw after on the *upside down pin* used the candid shot of him fixing it. But you are right too, and I intend to be heard more with more important things in the future. I don't know how this makes ETS look bad, it's not about us caring about "upside down pin" it's the pattern of backwards disorganization captured so perfectly in this total fail moment.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Socrates is just messing with Thrasymachus. Thrasymachus is talking about class structure I think, and coming from an angle like that the rich are more *just* because they have more, "do more."  Socrates is even like, answer this and I'll speak some truth, but than Socrates just asks like ten questions and gets the guy all befuddled. 

Somewhere at the end he's probably saying something about being "just" like don't judge a book by its cover or don't judge an action by appearances. But I think it's more of a class argument like political actions of rulers do not equal justice in itself.


 The musician analogy for one, is like a musician is a good musician and a non-musician is a bad musician, like if a hammer is broken it's not a hammer. And then he's messing with Thrasymachus because of course, there can be better musicians, he's making another point and Thrasymachus is stuck on labels. Plato doesn't seem to mind misleading the reader like Socrates misleds his pals.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There are many ways to get to Howard OnDemand. Whilst there are often posts on this subreddit claiming the OnDemand is empty or new shows have not been added they in fact are always there. The app is fucked up but not as it is implied. **There are about 5 or six places to click on HowardStern OnDemand and some of those options lead to a screen that says OnDemand is empty, but it is not empty** you just have click somewhere else. Yes it is not perfect, but it is always there, worst case open and close app and try again but I have always found HowardONDemand by clicking to it a different way when it says it is empty.  I'm pretty sure the empty result always comes from the same entry point so just try a different one.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-11-27 15:56:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Part seven of the failing media's failed ability to cover hard news, clearly afraid of more pro-Trump blowback for their falling ratings. At the very least, the Recount is very interesting and rip for political commentary and to instead continuously use it to casually accuse Jill Stein of stealing money is disgusting. 538.com is happy to throw the recount under the bus although they also point out "The paradox is that in our current electoral system, without routine audits, seeking proof requires calling for a recount, which in itself can undermine confidence in the election." They also point out this excellent USA today article about [why Voting Machine Audits are necessary](http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/11/18/election-audit-paper-machines-column/93803752/)


Donald Trump shit his pants about this on Twitter this morning and that is more than enough already.  Fake Twitter accounts are using key words to slam the Jill Stein recount. While the media sits on this the Trump Social Media Machine is crushing the story and the enthusiasm.  Stop saying it is not going to change anything, it will change something, so stop saying it will change nothing. Something progressive will happen as a result of this recount. So stop saying it won't change anything. Say nothing or say Jill Stein is hero. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A frog goes into a bank to get a loan. He goes up to the teller, she's wearing a name tag that says Mrs. Whack. 

"Hello there," says the frog. "My name is Kermit and I would like a loan."

"*The* Kermit the frog?" Exclaims Mrs. Whack.

"No, not that Kermit you fool! I *am* Kermit but not Kermit the frog, Kermit Jagger! For my father is the great rock and roll singer Mick Jagger."

"I see, well do you have collateral for the loan?"

"But of course," says Kermit and ever so carefully he reached into his pocket and pulled out a tiny ceramic pink elephant.

"I see," said Patty, for that was her first name, "I must ask the bank manager about this, whatever this is, i tell you i don't think it will get you a loan."

So she goes over to the bank manager and asks, "Mr. bank manager, this Kermit fellow wants a loan but all he has for collateral is this ceramic pink elephant and I don't even know what it is!"

The bank manager says, "It's a knick knack Patty Whack now give the frog a loan, his old man is a Rolling stone!"

<DATE> 2016-10-05 18:04:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I don't blame the media's overexposure of Donald Trump for his rise during the Republican Primaries; I would more simply say, the media failed in taking him down. The media failed to expose Trump and instead overexposed his gaffes and over analyzed their clear racism and hate. Perhaps they put him on TV too much, certainly they spent too much time debating what he said, so much so, that it normalized his exaggerations and filled in the blanks to explain that what he meant to say was a fair complaint...


**ParaphrasedNewsPerson:** *Trump says 'Hillary and Obama are the founders of ISIS.' Now that is clearly insane. If he had said instead, that Clinton and Obama did not stop the spread of ISIS and perhaps handled Iraq differently, that Terrorism would not be what it is today, he might have had something. Some Democrats have said basically the same thing of George W. Bush, so it's basically not that insane.*


Thank you media for your grand Trump Spam of debating the not debatable. Good job, but you know they are going to call you biased no matter what!



Speaking of DEBATABLE, I was incredibly shocked watching the VICE PRESIDENTIAL Debate last night, that a minute after Trump's Veep Michael Pence tells all woman of America what they can and cannot do with their bodies, that the media, liberals and conservatives, all media is calling Pence the clear winner. 


**ParaphrasedNewsPerson:** *Governor Pence said a bunch of crazy shit but clearly America will view Pence as having a better style and therefore he makes Trump look better. Interrupting is bad, remember? People will probably believe what Mike Pence was saying because he was more calm and assertive.* (And then the most hypocritical line ever..)  *Mike Pence will probably lose the post-debate, but he has won tonight."*


What the fuck does that mean? He won the debate but he will lose the post debate?  So he lied his pants off, but we will hold it against him later...what's that you say media, you say the media isn't biased against Trump and you'll prove it by patting Pence on the back. You will even say the moderator was a little biased and talkative? So the media will pretend Mike Pence won so the media can appear unbiased when they take him down for his lies later this week?...What? AND The media says we should pretend Pence won so we can make a BACKWARDS ATTACK against Trump's own demeanor? Do we have to say Pence is smooth to put down Trump who is rough? Once again, the media will let the evil policies stand strong WHEN presenting the truth that evil policy is evil is not bias!


**Someone who makes such a grand religious statement against abortion**


PENCE: But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that -- that ancient principle that -- where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life.


**someone who makes such a strong statement against an entire country of people**


KAINE: And with respect to refugees, we want to keep people out if they're dangerous. Donald Trump said keep them out if they're Muslim. Mike Pence..

PENCE: Absolutely...

KAINE: ...put a program in place to keep them out if they're from Syria. And yesterday an appellate court with three Republican judges struck down the Pence plan...

...PENCE: And I stand by that decision. And if I'm vice president of the United States or Donald Trump is president, we're going to put the safety and security of the American people first.


...KAINE:...We won't do it based on discriminating against you from the country you come from or the religion that you practice.


**someone who says their canidate Donald Trump did not say the things he said**


*PENCE: This isn't the old days where you can just say stuff and people believe it.*


That someone is a loser. Why media? Why appeal to deplorable people who will only say you tricked them, why justify their complaints?  Policy policy policy. Take down Trump for his policy. Take down pence for his policy. Take down conservatism for its policy. All Republicans that are anti-abortion, anti-imgratiin, anti gay right, and anti-civil rights in law enforcement are deplorable, are wrong, are losers. 



Let Trump deal with this:

*PENCE: You know, things don't always come out exactly the way he means them.*

*KAINE: Well, can I say...*

*PENCE: But I'm telling you what the policy of our administration would be.*


Just attack the policy!

<TEXT> During the Sept. 26 debate, Donald Trump claimed that he never supported the Iraq War. That is not true. In a 2002 interview with Howard Stern he expressed his support for the war.

I was against the war in Iraq, he told debate moderator Lester Holt.

He said that he did the interview with Howard Stern, very lightly. He then asserted that he had told Sean Hannity he was against the war. Hannity, an outspoken Trump supporter, said last week that Trump told him  in private conversations  that he was against the war."
