<TEXT> Probably will end up more than what he got in the popular vote.
No, it wont.

It will get, 100k, maybe 150k. With population of US 321,4 million. So, less then 1%. Not to mention, that there is no proof that these votes are legitimate and from different users.

And yeah, voting on reddit wont impeach anybody.

So, congrats with reddit gold. The only profit of these post. =) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Former employee here.
Traditional escape rooms:

1) The guy wanted to do a proposal. So we hided the ring in the quest. Zombie quest.

2) In this zombie quest we had a big figure of zombie (1:1) behind the steel bars. People werent supposed to get there. But guess what? They broke the bars.

3) Some obviously high guys. There were OK until one of them started smoking his joint right in the escape room (Zombie again). Had to remember him that weed is good but it won't help you fight the zombie apocalypse.

Virtual reality quest:

1) Vomiting. Few people were starting to feel nauseous in Oculuses.

2) There was a strange pair of guys. I think they were mentally disabled. Couldn't have done even the simple initial task.

3) Old war veteran (80-something) who was amazed by our VR quest and told us it's like going back to the days when he was a pilot.

And the main rule of escape rooms - people are wild beasts who will destroy everything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here comes my biased opinion.

I am a huge Rand supporter. But I do admit that her books are very badly written in terms of literature. These black and white heroes, stupid love lines, infinite energy sources in front of the rairoads... Just what?

In fact, what she did was trying to remake a philosophical system as a literature. It's like "Critique of Pure Reason" put into a fiction book. The ideas are great (or, at least, arguable) but the execution sucks.

If you really want to read something similar, interesting and arguable, I recommend you the books of the Austrian Economics School. Despite the name they are easy to read and quite enjoyable. You can start with "The Road to Serfdom" by Friedrich Hayek. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my childhood I read a fantasy book. This is what I remember:
1) There were two kids, I think, brother and sister.
2) They came to see their aunts, 2 or 3. Quite strange old ladies. One was sitting all the time on the same chair.
3) Then (I think) brother dissapeared (not sure about it)
4) Sister had to travel to some strange world through a shadow on the wall
5) This world didnt have a sun
6) Finally they returned and knew that their aunts knew this world.

<TEXT> Ivan Dolkin opened his eyes. He had terrible headache, his whole body was throbbing.  He tried to remember where he was. Memory was slowly coming back to him.

Ivan remembered how he was going to work. Crowded subway  Sudden bang And white smoke spurted out from the other side of the carriage. Panic Jam Then something hit him in the nape and everything swam before his eyes. He couldnt remember anything else.

So, got any better?  Ivan was deafened by the voice. Headache was throbbing. Groaningly he turned his head and saw a man in a white coat.

-What?  Ivan whispered, horrified by understanding that he cant make sense of the phrase. He knew each word but sense was erupting somewhere from his mind.

Sit  said the man in a white coat.

Ivan understood this command. He set his hands against the bed and sit. His eyes dimmed for a moment but then it suddenly got better. Headache was gone.

How do you feel?

What?  Ivan asked again, trying to understand the question.

How do you feel?

Its better now  he answered. The ability to think was slowly recovering. He started to understand what was going on. This man should be a doctor. And he, Ivan Dolkin, caught some nasty illness. 

What happened to me?  Ivan asked.

Gas bomb. Somebody planted a bomb with a psychedelic gas in the subway. You inhaled just a bit. People who were standing closer to the bomb were less lucky.

	
What happened to them? Did they die?

The doctor frowned.

Why are you asking? 

Just I want to know it. Its interesting


It seems like the gas effect is still present  said the doctor. But, I think, there will be no residual effect. Youll be given another needle now.

After the injection Ivan felt like some scale fall from his mind. Suddenly he understood how stupid his question was. There were no one he knew among passengers of the train. So does he really care what happened to them? Why does he have in oar?

So do you still want to know the fate of other passengers?  asked the doctor.

Ivan shook his head

How long have I been unconscious?

A few hours. Your cogitative functions should have been restored by now  if there werent irreversible changes in your brain. Now I will check it.
	
-  How?  asked Ivan.

We will perform a simple test on logical thinking. Listen to the task. Each triangle has three angles. The figure is a triangle. How many angles does it have?

Three  Ivan answered without thinking.

Great!  The doctor smiled broadly  You think the question was easy? And the patient from the neighboring ward said that there could be any amount of angles. He still can understand standalone statements but lost the ability to make logical conclusions. The more you inhale  the worse are the consequences. You inhaled just a bit

Ivan felt relief. This time he got lucky. But if he was standing at the other end of the car

And one more task. Accountants can count. A certain Petrov can count. What is his job?

Well - Ivan faltered  Maybe he is an accountant. But not necessary. He can have any job.

It seems like I scrambled to cheer you up  the doctor grew dark  Your logical thinking is messed up.
	
Why? Did I answer wrongly?  Ivan began to argue  There are lots of people who can count. For example, engineers. Why Petrov cant be an engineer?

You will have a hard time understanding it  the doctor answered  Engineer wasnt the part of the task.

So what? But such job exists. And they can count?

Engineer wasnt the part of the task  the doctor repeated patiently.  You have just concocted this engineer. Right answer  Petrov is an accountant.

Explain to me, why cant he work as someone else?  Ivan persisted.

And can you explain why triangle has three angles?

Because its a triangle.

And why triangle cant have four angles?

Because it was the part of the task.

In this case Petrov cant be an engineer because accountants can count. It was the part of the task too.

Bullshit  Ivan said.

No. Triangles have three angles. Petrov is an accountant. You cant explain the logic. Its either exists or not.

But you can count?  suddenly asked Ivan.

Of course  said the doctor.

You see! But you are not an accountant!

But Im not Petrov  the doctor smiled.  So there arent any contradiction. And dont try to find it  youll fail. Your ability to think is affected. Take it as a fact.

What should I do?  asked Ivan.

Itll pass. The brain can recover itself after such attack. But youll need some time. And now imagine that youre a little kid. And a kid can thrust his fingers in a socket or climb over a balcony rail without understanding the risks Do you understand? So dont do anything without consulting with somebody.

When will you release me from the hospital?  asked Ivan, bluntly expecting that it was some dream and he was about to wake up.

Right now  answered the doctor.  Medicine wont help you. But your brain will be slowly recovering Time is your best doctor. We called your brother and he came to pick you up.

Andrey Dolkin was sitting in the corridor. When he saw Ivan he rashly sprang to his feet and ran to him.

Ivan! I was starting to worry. They told me you would be released today  so Im sitting here, waiting for you. Are you OK?

I am OK  answered Ivan looking at the doctor.

Just a minute  said the doctor to Andrey.  I need to say you a few words.

The doctor took him aside and started to explain him something. Ivan wanted to join them but then he changed his mind.

Finally  he thought  the doctor can say anything he wants. He was trying to convince me that I had become insane for some reason. With his stupid tasks I perfectly understand what is logical.

What did he tell you?  asked Ivan agrin when he and his brother were going down the stairs.  About accountants and about how I cant think?

He just warned me not to let you go alone. That you can jump in front of the car or something.

Im not going to jump in front of anything. Did you really believe that Im insane?  Ivan stop talking aggrievedly.

They went out to the hospitals yard and came to Andreys car. Andrey opened the door and sat on the right seat.

You want me to drive the car  asked Ivan not having a clue.

Why?  Andrey were surprised  I will drive.

But why did you take the passengers seat.

I took the drivers seat. Keep your head shut and pile in.

Ivan opened the left door and got behind the wheel.

OK, Ill drive  he said  But you could tell it straight.

No way, Ill be driving  answered Andrey starting up the ignition. He shoved his left foot to the pedals, pushed the accelerator and started to ride out holding the wheel with his left hand.

Ivan gave him a puzzled look.

And how long do you drive this way?  he asked  Some people prefer to drive sitting behind the wheel.

But Im sitting behind it  answered Andrey with slight temper.

The wheel is on the left  noticed Ivan.

And Im on the right.

There was an awkward silence. Ivan understood nothing.

So what?  he said  Wheel is on the left and youre on the right. It means youre not behind the wheel.

I am behind the wheel  said Andrey  Youre goofing on me or dont you understand for real?  The doctor told me that youre a bit light-headed. I thought you have something like memory lapses Did you really stop distinguishing left and right?

I know where is right and where is left  said Ivan  Here is my right hand.

He showed his right hand to Andrey.

And where is the thumb on this hand? On the left or on the right? 

On the left.

You see. The hand is right but the thumb is on the left. The wheel is on the left, it means I should sit on the right.

Stop it! Im tired of your stupid jokes.

Calm down. Collect yourself. You were intoxicated with some psychedelic shit, you know. Everything seems strange to you because of it. The doctor told it would pass little by little when dead brain cells would be displacing by new ones.

OK. Suppose, youre right. But if I put my hand out I will touch the wheel. And you have to turn it to the side.

Andrey sighed a long sigh.

Imagine a plank with a hole. We put a bolt from the left side of it. What side we should put a female screw from?

From the right side

You see? To put to objects together we should position them to different sides.

But its totally different Well, let place the plank flatwise and the bolt will in the front and the screw  in the back.

Yep. For example, driver sits on the back seat in Japaneese cars. A matter of taste. But passenger always sits on the front left seat.

But why its not possible Pedestrian!!!

The pedestrian hit the bumper, rolled over the car and fell somewhere in the back. Andrey didnt even broke a little.

You You hit him!

So what? I drove on the green. Its his fault.

Ivans hands started to shake.

We should stop  he said  Stop and come back.

Why? Somebody will call him an emergency.

But you saw him! You could push the brakes!

Ivan, did they tell you in your childhood that you shouldnt cross the street against the traffic lights?
Why did you 

Answer my question.

Yes.

And why shouldnt you cross the street against the traffic lights?

Because a car can hit me.

There you are. Youve just made a conclusion that I can hit people who cross the streets on the red.

No! Wait Yes, you can, but its not the point. It doesnt mean that you must hit them.

I mustnt. I might not. Actually, I didnt care.

But you crippled him and maybe even killed.

Did you know him?

No, but

So why do you care?

Ivan wanted to say something but he stood silent. His brothers words suddenly seemed so logical. Really, why should he care about an unknown man? And Andrey says he had the right to hit him. But ethically

All right  Ivan said  Lets say that youre right. We wont talk about it anymore.

And youre doing well  said Andrey approvingly.  The doctor told me that the hardest thing for you would be believing in your illness. That everything will seems bloody illogical to you. But, perhaps, you got over yourself. By the way, weve arrived.

Andrey parked his car and the brothers left the car. Some ragged fellow who was sitting on the bench stood up and came to them.

Folks  he told  Can you lend me a hundred bucks? I really need it!

Ivan wanted to pass by but Andrey suddenly turned to the man.

When will you return the money?  asked he.

In a week. Here  answered ragamuffin.

OK  Andrey got the one hundred dollars and gave it to the man. He put it in his pocket and went across the street.

Do you know him?  Ivan asked.

This is the first time I see him.

Ivan stopped short.

Did you give one hundred dollars to a stranger?

I didnt give him the money, I lent them. He told that he would give it back.

Wait Why in the world would he give it back? You dont even know him.

You know what is to lend money?

Yes, of course. It means give for some time. But it seems that you gave your money for him forever.

You just havent heard. He said them he would give them back in a week.

I bet he wont.

That's another of your foibles? I will prove to you that he will. I lent him the money. For a week. Lend means give for some time, for him to return the money in a certain amount of time. Conclusion? He will give me back the money. Its logical, isnt it?

And if he wont?

And if a meteorite falls? And if the Earth explodes? Lets consider realistic variants.

Im sorry  Ivan wiped his forehead  Maybe, my brain is really stuck

Suddenly he clearly understood that the money would really be returned. Brothers string of logic appeared in his mind and seemed flawless for a moment But just for a moment

Youre right  said Ivan Damn it. Ive just realized that youre right and then my mind got stuck again. I dont understand why he will have to come again with the money All right, I wont argue with you anymore. I will try to believe in what youre telling me. Even if its bloody illogical.

Thats it Obey the elder and everythings gonna be all right  Andrey smiled, opened the house door and came in. Ivan followed him.

Know what?  said Ivan  Im so hungry. I havent eaten since morning. Dont you dare tell me its illogical!

Its logical  Andrey laughed  Be sure of it. I will the potatoes.

Andrey took the knife out of the drawer. Ivan turned to the dresser with cooking pots and opened it. Andrey stabbed his brother with the knife. Ivan fell down.

Andrey called the police and sat down on the chair. He was sitting and was starring with unseeing eyes before him. The police rang at the door in ten minutes. Andrey opened it.

He turned his back  he was explaining to the policeman with tears in his eyes  Ivan saw me holding a knife and turned his back. If I have a knife and he is turning his back I should stab him. Aint it a fact? Its logical, isnt it?

Its logical  agreed the policeman  Its strange that he didnt think about it.

He was mentally ill  said Andrey  Have you heard about the terrorist attack in the subway? He was there?

The policeman examined the body.

It seems that youre telling the truth  he said  He was stabbed from behind. It means his back was really turned towards you. Looks like it was a suicide. Perhaps, he suddenly became weary of life? Who knows what comes in crazy peoples mind?

Yes, I think so  Andrey looked at his brothers corpse  Even little kids know about the hunter instinct. You shouldnt turn your back to an armed man He could hardly forget it. Probably, he just wouldnt want to live in the world which contradicts his logic. You know, today I hit the pedestrian I was driving on the green and didnt violate the rules. But he tried to convince me I was wrong. He was very uneasy about it.

Anyhow, theres nothing to do here for me  said the policeman heading towards the exit  There arent component elements of a crime.

Andrey sat down and caressed his brothers head.

Ivan, Ivan  said he silently  What have you done

<TEXT> Hello, fellow book-lovers. I am from Russia, although I am not living there now. I thought of the following - there are huge number of modern Russian authors - Prilepin, Sorokin, Pelevin, Ulitskaya, Max Frei and many many more - almost or totally unknown in the English-speaking countries. I can do the translation of some of these novels for you (my first degree is translation and interpretation) or find already existing translations.

What do you think of this idea? Please let me know your opinions in the comment section.

P.S. Also I noticed the absence of Russian section in the Literature of the world feature. I can contribute there as well. </TEXT>
