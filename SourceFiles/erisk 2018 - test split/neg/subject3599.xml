What to do? Stop texting her directly. Go have a life. Send snaps of excellent things you're doing that are clearly intended for a wider audience. If she's interested, she'll pop back up. Trust me on this; sometimes the greatest thing you can say or do is NOTHING. 

Fill your life with other things aside from thoughts of her and you'll find it becomes much easier to keep her interested in you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Original Jazz Classics was a reissue effort by Fantasy and related labels. At one time, those were getting blown out at $9 by various web retailers back in the early '00s before vinyl had staged a comeback. Here's a list of the discography:

Crazy confirmation occurred last night when I saw a(n apparently mutual) friend that related he and I had 'crossed swords' and he was told *I* had begged to sleep over, wouldn't stop calling or texting, and had begging to see her every night since. Alllllrighty then!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Intensity is decent quality and will do what you want. To get digital in, you can use a cheapo USB sound card to capture from like this one (https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-Adapter-External-Digital-ICUSBAUDIO7D/dp/B002LM0U2S). You just have to make sure to keep the video and audio in sync! 

As for capturing Dolby Digital; I don't know of a solution. SPDIF stereo/matrix Dolby Surround is as good as it gets I believe. Now, I haven't tried this but you theoretically SHOULD be able to capture DTS LDs in full 6 channel because the audio is stored on the regular PCM tracks as PCM and output as S/PDIF data. So long as you figure out how to store it bit-perfect (meaning no sample rate conversion, etc), spitting it back out into a receiver should give you 6 channel DTS.

Technics 'tables tend to live forever if not abused, and the direct drive variants eliminate the need to replace belts.

<TEXT> Motion to dismiss. Clearly, /u/salad_tongs_1 may have skirted the edges of good taste and karma-whoring but the post is entirely truthful in a literal sense. The name of the game in question is 'Everything'. The game is sold on Steam. Steam is offering 20% off the purchase of 'Everything' until April 28th. Therefore the post was entirely factual and cannot thus be considered a bamboozle or untruth. That some may have believed 'Everything' meant all games on Steam were 20% off merely points to the deficiency in their reasoning skills and/or complete lack of sense of humor. Defense rests, your honor.

EDIT: Defense requests the court take Judicial Notice that /u/salad_tongs_1 is an overworked moderator of /r/Steam and puts up with mountainous bullshit on the daily; if this does not warrant latitude, nothing does. </TEXT>

I would put forth that an innocent mistake was committed by my client and the necessary elements to establish malice and feckwittery cannot be established due to low IQ on the part of the defendant.  </TEXT>

Oh, and THEN; I paid for NBD onsite repair. Every damn time they STILL try to get me to send it in for 'expedited depot repair'. Expedited to them? Fourteen days. HELL NO. I paid to have it repaired so I didn't have to be without the computer and have to argue to have a tech sent out every time. Would I buy another one? Maybe. There's no better machine out there for my uses.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> P mount counterweights don't work as normal counterweights do. Most P mount tonearms weren't adjustable at all. They're designed to be plug and play. The carts meet a narrow design spec and you don't static balance the tonearm; there's always at least 1 gram of weight on it. The stylus doesn't look as though there's any abnormal weight on it while playing. I wouldn't worry about that. 

What I WOULD worry about is that there looks to be corrosion on the cart and the cantilever. The aluminum looks quite oxidized. I'd get a new stylus at the least and preferably replace the cart entirely. A replacement M92E is $49 on Amazon, a replacement stylus is $25. At the least, replace the stylus. Also, make sure the tonearm moves freely throughout its vertical and horizontal range of motion. If there's even the slightest binding or resistance, it's likely to trash your vinyl.  </TEXT>

Also; the major US carriers all have WiFi calling. Why would I want this when I can use the same measures I would to gain access to this service to just connect directly to the home carrier's wifi calling and have better functionality without the intermediary? 

Absent wifi calling, I see the use case. Outside the US (say, Asia, Central or South America) where borders are frequently crossed and roaming may get prohibitive and carriers may not offer wifi calling, I see the use case.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Life is brutally complicated at times. Stay above the cut and thrust and do the best you can to co-parent. If you can manage having your daughter spit time between you as she gets older, you'll find you'll likely end up with an incredibly well rounded daughter of whom you will be insanely proud. 

Kids are intelligent and if one parent is being an asshole, they figure it out.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Band 30 overlay issues in San Antonio </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-22 23:51:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Seeing a lot of Band 30 (WCS band) popping up, especially in San Antonio. Having massive issues with it. Phone will select Band 2 initially but prefers 30 which in some areas (Riverwalk, I-10 and 1604, 281 and 410) pretty much doesn't work. No data throughput at all. Airplane mode corrects the problem for a bit but once it's back on band 30, I effectively have no data. Anyone else having issues? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bought this for the office. I'm damn impressed! Finish is top notch and it looks great. Sound is very good; I like the AT-95E a HELL of a lot more than I do the OM5e, so I'd give it an edge over any of the lower-end Pro-Ject 'tables. The arm isn't nearly as substantial as it looks but it still has proper adjustments and does the trick. Note that sound comments are based upon use with an external preamp. See below.

This looks almost identical to the Teac TN-300 with some added features; right down to the straight tonearm and goofy angled headshell. For this reason you CANNOT use a standard headshell on this 'table despite the standard connector and collet. 

Just skip the internal preamp and forget the bluetooth and USB functionality. The internal preamp has quite low output, and is noisy once you turn up volume enough to compensate for that. In addition, the dynamics are squashed, and...well... it's passable but absolutely does not do the 'table and cartridge justice. An Art DJ Pre II works wonderfully for an extra $50 and for $300 you end up with a great looking, and sounding, combo.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Battery bulge/touchpad issue on the XPS9550, I purchased additional warranty and on-site support. Dell now saying, the battery warranty is one year and additional warranty coverage doesn't apply? Required to disassemble computer to provide information from battery before they'll dispatch support. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-13 20:54:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Long and short of it: Purchased XPS9550 March 11, 2016 from Best Buy. Purchased an upgrade to on-site service, and accidental damage and a two year warranty extension that next week directly from Dell. Because Dell shipped the laptop to Best Buy they assert the warranty started in January, when they shipped it. But, i'm getting ahead of myself...

I'm having the battery bulging that results in the touchpad not working properly. Filed a support request online after failing the self-test. Dell ships a RAM stick??? Did a chat with a support rep and... 'the warranty on the battery is only one year'. 

Well, I was never provided with updated terms and conditions when I purchased the warranty or indeed ANY documentation other than seeing the information update on the support site. So, that isn't going to fly. They've asked for part information from the battery. I now have to disassemble the computer to get this. Not happy.  </TEXT>

The video does not show studio cameras, etc. It shows another astronaut holding the camera mounted to his chest and using it. The film used was 70mm film in light-tight magazines that could be changed without exposing the film. That's part of why they used those specific Hasselblad cameras.

<TEXT> Ed-zachary. Used to be an exec in a 900 person business. We had unions try to organize not once, not twice, but THREE times over fifteen years. Nobody inside the organization ever drove this; it was always outside organizers. The first time we flipped out and basically told EVERYONE if they had felt like they couldn't approach us before that here's a special cellphone straight to the CEO and if there's a problem, call. Very few calls, but we did get some legit issues we solved. Vote went badly for the union. 

Next time? We started noticing complaints going up from customers, people talking to employees as they walked into the parking lot (we finally kicked them off property when OUR people started complaining and one got into a fight with an organizer who tried to keep him from getting into his car, we really were trying to be fair), organizers calling employees (someone gave them a list of phone numbers), etc. How it didn't make the news here I have no idea. That vote went even worse for the union. 

The last time was much more subtle and they just left fliers everywhere and bought a few billboards. THAT one they actually moved the needle but still lost. We treated our people right and thankfully the organizers were vague enough in the sweetness and light promises that our folks saw through it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recently bought a lower-end 'table for the office that uses removable headshells. Decided it might be nice to have a few extras to cart-swap, etc. Contacted their parts department, ordered two, they came in today brand new, perfectly packed... WITH NEW AT-95E CARTS MOUNTED (yes, styli as well). 

Let me be clear; the price for each headshell was ~$15. Unless there's a freakin' CRAZY markup on cartridges, there's no way this was intentional although the part number matched what I ordered. So either they just don't care and are taking a loss, they AREN'T taking a loss and the carts are that cheap, or somebody made a mistake and I got $110 worth of carts and two headshells for under $40 shipped. 

My inclination is to call 'em, tell them what happened and offer to pack it all back up for them to have picked up if it was a mistake. If it wasn't, I know I did the right thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh? Considering I've helped install 3 LP-120s and 4 Carbon DCs I may have a bit of personal knowledge. Neither 'table is perfect. Pro-Ject's QC however is woeful. Two had a hum due to bad wiring in the tonearm. One had a platter that wobbled. One was perfect.  Of the LP-120s, none had performance issues although the fit and finish could be better. 

I think the DC sounds better. But it's not nearly as sturdy, has that idiotic anti-skating counterweight/fishing lure, and is much harder to use if one wants to play anything but LPs or wants to swap cartridges. You also need a pre-amp to use it. The 120 OTOH can use standard 1/2" mount headshells or carts with built in mounts, has 78 RPM built in, and can plug in to anything that accepts analog input. Both have their place.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> IF you actually wish to apologize for the offense you caused: Call the Chef you offended, he likely will not answer. Leave him a voicemail simply stating that you are calling only to offer an apology of the utmost sincerity, that you are mortified, and that you appreciate that he was considerate enough to take the time to call you. Be upfront and contrite. Have a text prepared that you send immediately after you've ended the call that asks him please not to delete the voicemail, that you know the position is no longer available and you merely wish to apologize because your conduct was so reprehensible. 

In the meantime; go find someplace else to work that isn't as notable. Give it a month or two, then start applying elsewhere, and be upfront with those to whom you apply as well. If you truly have talent, you'll get back in. If not there, plan to move elsewhere and pursue your passion. 

I'd also ask for a quick meeting with your old boss after you call, and explain in person.

<TEXT> Sigh. I think it's the first bullet, myself. Old and unplayable but original seems to carry the day. Me? I threw away over 2000 records in the late 80's, and I like to listen what's left of my collection for the most part. I don;t want a lot of records any more. I want the ones I like to listen to and with that I refuse to pay $20 for anything on vinyl, new or old. Although I have bought a few... :-)

That's about the size of it! Not only that; knowing there's very rarely any 'provenance' for modern vinyl and I may very well be buying vinyl that was sourced from a 192Kbps MP3 in some cases and a 44.1/16 file in far more, I stay far far away. I very seriously doubt most modern reissues are sourced from the original analog.

I've been lucky to find great stuff in the bargain bins and have equipment that plays even semi-thrashed vinyl well. So, I stick to digital for new and vinyl for old. European pressings seem to be better than US; so if you can find 'em on Ebay or in the used bins, grab them. I have a ton of W. German 70s rock that is glorious. All from Half-Price Books. </TEXT>

If I'm reading the service manuals correctly, the Onkyo amp is made up of discrete transistors which is vastly superior to the chip amps utilized in the Technics. This is from a period when Onkyo were very much a step up..

EDIT: Here's an Audiokarma thread on the US versions which were largely identical except for an inferior radio tuner. The 7530 appears to be equivalent to the TX-830.

One like this perhaps?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So my 9550 has bluescreened ever since the mobo was replaced (first one stopped powering on). At first it was at random every few days and started getting worse and worse to where it would bluescreen regularly every 2-6 hours. The problem would get worse when multitasking and using memory intensive software. 

I was unpacking from a trip and noticed one of the screws on the bottom of the machine was loose. Went ahead and took the bottom off, cleaned out a ton of dust, and carefully but firmly reseated the memory. This seems to have done the trick or at least greatly helped; I've gone two days now without a bluescreen.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You needn't dig the cables out. So you have two 4 ohm speakers and four 2 ohm speakers? Series the 2 ohm, then get a cheapo '90s receiver and connect the 4 ohm and series-ed 2 ohms to the A and B outputs. Should work just fine. If four are four ohm and two are two ohm, series one of the four ohm pairs with the two ohm pair and you'll end up with a 4 ohm load and a 6 ohm load. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's an extreme oversimplification of "they". Many Jews in Israel and elsewhere disagree with the actions taken on settlements just as many Americans disagree with the course of action America takes and so on and so forth. So, getting down to brass tacks, what's your problem with those that identify as Jewish given you think people should stop identifying as Jews. 

Follow on: Are Jews the only problem or should members of other religions similarly stop identifying? Should Muslims stop identifying as Muslim? Would that help solve the territorial/governmental issues in Syria, Turkey and elsewhere? If not, why is it only the Jews that should stop identifying? Or is it religion as a whole? Please do explain because the point seems awfully inconsistent unless applies globally. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read somebody trying to justify their purchase. My experience was being invited to a home for several annual birthday/charity fundraisers. The mutual friend and I share an interest in home theater/audio/recording with the homeowner. 

The homeowner had just torn out a 5.1 system consisting of Energy Veritas V2.3i in the front, V2.0c center, v2.0r surround, powered by a Lexicon LX-7 amp and Anthem D2V preamp in a dedicated room. Subwoofer was a JL Audio F112. I've heard the system on numerous occasions and thought it quite good. 

What he'd installed this last go round and what I heard was a setup of Silver Phantoms. My issues with the Phantoms? The white cases reflect light like crazy in a darkened room, especially with the sides pumping away like mad. The sound is very good, very dynamic, and with a solid foundation, but I don't consider it lightyears beyond what can be achieved with traditional componentry. Also, they manifestly do NOT do room lock and shudder the way a proper sub does.

I also found that I missed the point source bass as opposed to the more omni nature of the Phantoms. The Veritas played quite low so the F112 only handled bass below 40Hz. I recall the last time I heard the system a much more distinct precision =ability to 'locate' a sound even down into the lower registers. That was diminished in the bass although improved over the veritas through the midband and treble. The Phantoms also were missing musicality. I'm also an analog guy and my current setup is B W 802d fronts, HTM-2D center, and XT2s for side and rear. We also listened to some jazz tracks and some of the nuances I'm used to simply weren't there.

Again, I'm not saying they suck at all. I do not believe they're the end-all be-all and for $15k I can put together a system that sounds better TO ME. It will not be as convenient but it will not have the software quirks either. To each their own. </TEXT>

If they keep rejoining, leave. Took calmly saying goodbye and leaving on two occasions (once before dinner, the ultimate insult in a Jewish home ;) ), but we no longer have those problems.  </TEXT>

Because claiming that valor and those achievements is a fraud perpetrated upon a public. Because in doing so, by their conduct, those that perpetrate such fraud diminish and dishonor those that have been there and done that and the armed forces as a whole. 

What impression does it give for some broken down jackhole to be claiming they singlehandedly killed fifteen people with seemingly no thought or remorse at all?

<TEXT> Here's what that is. The first is making it illegal to *fraudulently* deface coinage. To make defacing a coin illegal, one must intend to deceive. 

Or.

One must *fraudulently* be in possession of currency or attempt to pass such currency *knowing* that it is altered and not as originally was. 

So if you have a quarter coin that you remade as a dollar coin, that violates both. But again, the key word is, for both, fraud. You must intend to deceive. If you remake a quarter as a metal teddy bear, you aren't intending to deceive that it was originally a quarter or pass it off as a different coin.

Ironically, one could violate the above by taking a quarter and somehow making it into a penny.  </TEXT>

Way I got around it if outlining the thing didn't get me going. Just start typing. Put down things you know need to go in. Start in the middle. Start at the end. Once you break the 'blank dam', everything will flow. Just. Fucking. Do. It. You'll feel so much better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure if it compromises a potential claim but what you might try if you otherwise like your boss, need the job, and want to take a step before going to HR is to confront your boss, tell her you do not appreciate such rumors and do not consider it a laughing matter (if she says she was joking) and that you're asking her to call everyone in that she told and refute the message with you present as well as issuing a public apology. A sexual harassment claim is a big deal and can have huge consequences. If the culture there is to play fast and loose with such things? Might be better served to attack head on instead of possibly poisoning things by filling a claim.

<TEXT> They may want it to be their primary platform? And as cord-cutting continues to grow that may be the case. Yet "primary platform" does not in any way mean "shutting down satellite distribution". The costs to do so would be absolutely astronomical in terms of equipment replacement for home and commercial subscribers. Absent a heretofore unseen and unplanned leap in wired broadband availability and capacity, satellite will continue to be necessary for at least a decade. Wireless is a nonstarter; LTE networks would be brought to their knees by mass IPTV use in the home. A bunch of 360p streams to phone screens is very different than 2-5 DirecTV boxes per home multiplied by hundreds of homes per neighborhood all streaming different programs at 1080p or 4k and then potentially recording another 2 or 3 programs at the same time. That scenario doesn't even work over Uverse copper. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ...and he's wrong as phone compatibility with AT T goes. The C-Spire version of the S7 supports CDMA and GSM. It's not going to be perfect because it doesn't have a few bands AT T uses such as UMTS band 4 but it does 850/1900 which are the most important for 3G and has all the crucial LTE bands (2/4/5/12/17). You'll miss Band 30 which is a capacity overlay band. Not sure if C-Spire ships their phones SIM unlocked the way Verizon does. If not you'll need to have it unlocked. If C-Spire refuses, there're other ways to get it unlocked but you'd be better served to sell it and get an AT T version at that point.

EDIT: Missed that this was an Ebay auction. You're better off paying a bit more and finding a used AT T version. Model number you want is SM-G935A.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, it's the exact opposite. AT T is trying to do away with Uverse TV entirely and move all video to DirecTV which is far less service intensive and places fewer demands on the copper plant/allows them to market higher speeds since no bandwidth is needed for video. Eventually they want to do away with copper entirely and be all wireless. They're likely going to end up just giving up on wired broadband entirely.

<TEXT> Quite possible he did do it on purpose. It's called 'stealing a pair'. He may not have intentionally disconnected you (may have knocked your pair loose while in the box) or your service may not have been properly marked so he didn't know he was taking you out of service; but he was there fixing someone else's service and needed a new wire pair and there yours went. Just went through that and it took FOUR callouts to get it resolved. I R did have to come fix the problem and we ended up getting a free speed upgrade and a bonded pair circuit due to all the trouble.

<TEXT> Shit show of advice here. Do you have test anxiety? Did you run out of time? Did you complete every section? Did you miss something major on an essay? Was your MBE bad? Several of my classmates failed the Feb '16 bar and passed this time. In one case it was purely the taker psyching themselves out. Another, it was not understanding (after three years, mind you) how to write a proper Bar essay. 

Start studying now, but take it slow. If MD publishes past bar essays and answers, read EVERY ONE of them. Outline them. Utilize the retake guarantee the prep course likely has. If it's Kaplan, submit as many essays as you can. Also, do not overlook the MPT and do several practice ones under test conditions. SOURCE: I just passed the TX bar and thought I didn't have a shot in hell. 

Why would you begin to think a fail is the end and you should toss the JD out the window???  So go sign on as a paralegal somewhere and go for it again in February.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The question I'd be asking myself is what good a degree from a UK law school do if you intend to return to/remain in Canada. Also, Sussex from an initial glance isn't one of their top universities. Looks like there's about ~50 law schools in the UK and Sussex is mid-pack. Do they have a Criminology program that is notable? 

My thought is; you're better served going to a Canadian law school if you can get into one, especially if you intend to live and practice in an area that utilizes civil law vs common law. This is especially true given costs of attending school in the UK. If you can't get into a Canadian university? Consider whether lawschool is really the right path.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Network network network network. Seriously. But not just professionally. Socially as well. I would not have made it through law school if it weren't for a rich and enjoyable life outside school. The Meetup app is great for this; events tailored around things of interest to you. Also; make sure to make time and take time AWAY from school. You can be too focused. If there's other law schools in your area, meet some of those students and compare notes. Great way to make friends and get/give fill-in material that might not covered in your/their classes.

<TEXT> Why do you want to go to law school? This is the most important question. 

Some schools your experience will help but these are going to be lower/4th tier schools that are only useful if you already have a career path and/or connections and just need the JD. 

You're a sophomore so you have plenty of time. Focus on getting your GPA as high as possible and start studying for the LSAT now. Take practice tests on a regular basis. Plan to take the LSAT the June before your senior year in college. You will then have your score and a good idea of your graduating GPA to consider when applying. If your LSAT is subpar you can retake it but schools see ALL scores and will average between them. If your first LSAT is low, consider that an indication you may wish to give law school a miss. 

Truly, if you have a solid realty business going? Focus on that and stick with it. You'll avoid the expense of law school and make as much or more money. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Um... don't feel so bad. Moved with parents when I was fourteen into a fixer upper. House had a pool that hadn't been filled in probably ten years. Deep end was home to a 'pond' with a thriving colony of frogs. First night my best friend stayed over we naturally beelined for the pool. After screwing around on bikes for a while (it was a very large pool) we made for the frogs. Probably 30-40 frogs from smaller ones to full grown big ass toads. 

So what do we do? See how high we can toss them and watch them go splat on the plaster. I felt no regret over this as a child, but did later in life. We'd toss them up vertically, their legs and arms would shoot out full length as they spiraled upward, then hang for a brief instant and come plummeting down. Amazingly, none were killed by this but the splats were very loud and very 'splat-ty'. Exactly what you want as a fourteen year old. 

The frogs? They'd lay, still and no doubt shocked, for a few seconds to over a minute. Then they'd gather themselves up and progressively crawl/walk/hop off back to the 'pond' at the deep end.  In our defense, we never tossed a frog twice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're still going to be based on T-mobile, Verizon, AT T or Sprint except in certain circumstances in limited areas of the country (C-Spire, US Cellular, Viaero, and other regional providers). 

Burning Man's Papa Legba camp and Burning Man in general are not valid to use as an example of not providing reliable services. There's nothing and nobody out on the Playa except for BRC when it's there. There's zero reason to build out permanent coverage there. Commnet has provided roaming coverage there but quite frankly many Burners prefer the disconnect from default world. Not sure why Range Networks decided not to continue their camp/network but absent that, you're not going to find a commercial cellular service that'll cover Burning Man except a satellite service like Iridium which are horribly expensive and offer data speeds equivalent to 1988 dialup at it's best (9600bps). 

If you want the ability to use multiple carriers and have frequent access to WiFi, go with Project Fi. 

TL;DR: Verizon is, on balance, the most reliable network in the country, business practices aside. You may be mistaking phone issues for network problems.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep, so unlike elsewhere analogue was not banned, just no longer required. So almost all carriers went to more spectrum efficient technologies almost immediately. But especially out in the boondocks there's always some independent carrier that keeps old tech alive for the customers that just won't move. IMTS (precursor to AMPS/0G) was 40+ years old and still in use into the middle of the last decade in Canada. Believe the last carrier was Bell Aliant. </TEXT>

The Elite and StarTAC were VIP versions from Motorola direct. Motorola had an awesome cellular service that required a contract with them, but could be switched from city to city at will. They had number blocks with carriers throughout the country. So I could call them up and get a New York number if going to NYC, then get a Vegas number if going there, etc. Saved a ton on roaming charges and just returned any voicemails I got on my primary number. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The state where you were married is crucial here; that law controls how long it takes to get divorced and what you need to do to get the divorce. Some states have no waiting period to divorce, some have as long as an 18 month waiting period before you can divorce. 

If she has an attorney do NOT just sign off on the decree you're handed. Even if she doesn't; if you aren't drafting the paperwork have someone look over it because in most states what you sign is what will take effect even if the family law code provides differently, because that divorce decree is also an enforceable contract. 

If things are truly amicable let her have all the furniture and household items and use that to negotiate her taking on more of whatever debt you have (if any). Go find several much younger and better looking rebounds and enjoy freedom and the joy of doing your own laundry and ironing.  </TEXT>

No. When I may be in Hong Kong for 3 days, China for 2, Taiwan for 36 hours, then swing through Germany, Spain, South Africa, Israel, Jordan, Turkey and Malta within the space of two weeks the cost of the sim packs alone would pay for 10 gigs of data plus. Not to mention the ability to switch carriers at will and get around service difficulties and coverage issues when I'm here in the US. Fi ain't for everyone, but it is a wonderful and unique service for use cases where it works. That it doesn't work for you means precisely nothing as to the usefulness of the service to others. 

EDIT: Each one of those SIMs takes time to acquire, (sometimes) to initially load, to reload and recharging in many cases is not trivial and requires time dicking around  finding and picking the right recharge voucher for the SIM you have (I'm looking at you, Orange/Partner), and then screwing with portals in foreign languages figuring out how to apply it if the thing doesn't just let you apply the voucher via text. Time is also money. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a hell of a lot of info on the amp [here](http://www.avforums.co.za/index.php?topic=19493.00). I believe the name "ParaPix" came from there and is used to describe the amp as opposed to the entire subwoofer. The "ParaPix" amp was intended for use in this subwoofer. HTP International actually made the audio equipment and (supposedly) licensed the Paramount Pictures name for a time. 

They appear to have gone out of business in the mid '90s; their trademark shows as abandoned at that time. This [article](http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-05/business/fi-21359_1_patent-infringement) on an infringement suit against them details the likely reason behind their demise. 

In short, it's pretty much an OEMed subwoofer with the Paramount logo slapped on. The sub driver looks like an 8-10" coated paper woofer straight out of the Radio Shack catalog. If it works, just use it 'till it dies. As far as any worth, perhaps $20-30? Tons of used and new subs out there including Dayton's 12" for $135 or so that use what are likely far superior drivers.  </TEXT>

If we're being precise; the V2 had no guns, couldn't fire bullets, and thus would be incapable of shooting itself down. Hans Mutke was the pilot of the ME-262 in question; the effects he felt were consistent with experiences at transonic speeds but were not necessarily indicative of crossing the sound barrier. Further to this point, testing by [Messerschmitt](https://books.google.com/books?id=8kX2DAAAQBAJ lpg=PA117 ots=MOmafaUuq1 dq=me-262%20.86%20dive pg=PA117#v=onepage q=me-262%20.86%20dive f=false) indicated a maximum speed of Mach .86 for the ME-262, with the airplane becoming increasingly unstable past Mach .83 and becoming uncontrollable past Mach .86. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a Business Centurion (black) AMEX. The personal cards have the oval at the center. The business cards have them on the left. Used to be called Corporate cards but was renamed somewhere back in '06 or so? Source: Had a personal and business/corporate black card. Ditched the corporate when annuals went from $1k/year to $2,500. Ditched the personal when United Airlines left the program. 

Originally ('00) the requirement was $120k spend in a year and 'good account history' with amex. I'd had a platinum since '97, didn't have great credit but had great cashflow, and was never invited but had the personal card 48 hours after asking. Got the Corporate a year later because different perks plus keeping expenses off the personal card. Annual spend requirement for that was $240k. Again, no invite but received after request. No initiation fees back then and the benefits were far better. 

Common misconception: the cards don't have a limit. They absolutely do have a limit that varies according to your use patterns (if you charge $10k/month regularly they're going to cut you off after you go up to about $12-18k depending on several factors including the nature of the charges) and the corporate/business cards have a disclosed limit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [This thing](http://oppositelock.kinja.com/why-you-need-to-start-loving-the-ford-tempo-v6-coupe-1686804827). Dealer couldn't sell it, and damn near nobody else would drive it. I had a hand-me-down Mark VII LSC (that I miss to this day) and this was when Lincoln guaranteed a loaner when a car was in for service. They knew no male under 50 wanted a damn Town Car.  Asked if I could drive a stick, said yes, got the Tempo. First time it had about 230 miles. They stuck it in loaner service and last time I had it was 3 years after when the heater core blew and took out the dash electronics. 6,800 miles and I'd put on about 3,000 of 'em. End of an era. Traded the LSC on a Subaru SVX which was its own case of interesting.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The poor unloved Tempo/Topaz twins. Underpowered, underdesigned, overugly, and over here. The rare ones with the V6 however, did not suck. Didn't handle any better, but lighting up the fronts and going straight forward with the fronts at a 45 degree angle was always good for a few laughs so long as it was a loaner and not your vehicle. Somewhere, out there, there's either a Topaz or the remnants that would shudder uncontrollably if I ever came near again.

Given the same results whether using a Sprint or Fi SIM, the issue would seem not to be with the Fi service but with the hardware. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The "lost revenue" argument is somewhat specious. It's only truly lost revenue if AA could have sold every last seat in the premium cabin for a premium fare. That's almost never the case. Source: i used to fly  internationally a lot on AA and get upgraded a lot. The actual marginal cost of flying an additional premium class passenger is somewhere in the hundreds of dollars.

The gifting of miles may cause more lost revenue but using those miles is subject AAdvantage availability and, again, those seats do not take precedence over sales.

<TEXT> So... i'm stuck at O'Hare airport thanks to a delay and utilizing the facilities. Shortly after I 'engage', another guy enters the stall next to me and makes a call to someone. By the conversation it sounds like a boss. Guy is a total douche, talking at max volume about meetings and sales figures etc. Having finished, I flush at least five or six times, make some violent throat clearing noises, then start singing "Sit on my face and tell me that you love me" loudly enough that it had to be audible. Guy says "Let me call you back" and hangs up. I left feeling a little better about life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Friend with a ranch has had two towers on his land since the '80s. The contracts were drafted such that Southwestern Bell or their successors have to provide free phones, free roaming, and free service with all features for his family. No limitations were placed on the term "family".

Now, back then, the features available were things like call waiting, call forwarding, voicemail, etc. No big deal. Things changed rapidly with the advent of data and international roaming. They didn't want to provide either but I believe he threatened to hand out phones to every one of his third, fourth, fifth and sixth cousins and they relented. They go overseas 4-5 times per year and their collective bills (which are credited off), are routinely up over $6k in those months due to data usage.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did the plane have in flight phone service? The MCC/mobile country code the in flight network uses might be based in China. Or you might have been flying parallel to an airplane that had their in flight service turned on. 

The notices seem to be triggered based upon what networks the phone sees even if it can't register. I've been in the north of Israel and thanks to atmospheric conditions gotten a "welcome to Egypt" notice followed by a Welcome to Israel then a Welcome to Syria. Did a network scan and sure enough saw two Egyptian networks, the three Israeli, and two Syrian networks pop up. The control channel broadcasts can carry quite a bit farther than the network can be used. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My guess- you aren't activated properly on USCC and perhaps not at all. "Emergency calls only" happens on the GSM side when your sim isn't activated or your carrier has no roaming agreement if not on your home carrier (or you aren't permitted to roam for some reason but that wouldn't be the case here). So either T-Mobile doesn't exist where you are and doesn't roam with the carrier present or the sim isn't active and you can't register at all.

Sprint and USCC work differently; devices on CDMA based networks will find and show signal even if they're not authorized on the network. The message you're getting sounds like what you'd get in the old days if you were roaming in an area where your carrier had no agreement. You'd either get transferred to a "roaming operator" or could register with a credit card to get a PIN you'd enter to make calls that would be billed to your card. If your service isn't properly activated that's exactly what I'd expect because USCC doesn't know who you are. If the new sim doesn't fix the problem and you're not in the T-Mo footprint try taking a drive to where there's native T-Mobile and Sprint service and do the #FIXME# code there. Actually, it might work now with this SIM. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Might try forcing USCC and seeing if their roaming agreements get you somewhere. Fi makes some roaming areas 'look like home' and won't trigger the 5X roaming bug if that's the case. Using the USCC profile I roam on Verizon with 3G without issue in Houston.

Failing that a nuclear option on the 5X if there's indeed CDMA roaming in that area that you can't access due to the bug is to switch to Sprint via dialer code, disable the Fi App, and go enable CDMA roaming. If data doesn't work though you'll need WiFi to get the app back I believe. Disclaimer: it worked for me ONCE.

Frankly any hole in the wall taqueria is going to have cheap and decent food. Bacon bean and cheese on flour for breakfast. Burger, tycoon flats, candy's old fashion, or the longhorn cafe. 

Koi kawa if you want sushi. And for hangover food it's again a little pricey but max's wine dive in the Quarry. Fried chicken. Skip the other sides and go with two servings of jalapeno grits. Unless you like dark meat tell em you want all white. It's a place that'll make the wife happy too.

<TEXT> That's strange. If it's working on WiFi that likely rules out the port being problematic. Highly unlikely you'd need to change your number to get this fixed. Might be an issue with the underlying T-mobile phone number (you're assigned phone numbers on T-mo and Sprint) and a SIM replacement may be necessary to fix the problem. If that's so, you'll still keep your Fi phone number. All random guesses however. Hope you get it sorted soon. </TEXT>

What happens when you're on WiFi in airplane mode? Can you receive calls then? Also, when you activated with Fi, did you port your number from another carrier? Was it a new number assigned by Google? A Google Voice number that transferred to Fi? If you ported in, issues with that process might be why you can't receive incoming calls. Or if you just ported, it may take time for the process to complete.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's unlikely the $10/GB covers the cost of roaming data. This is why Fi reserves the right to limit or terminate someone's service if they roam too frequently or for the majority of the time. Limiting data throughout in this way keeps users from utilizing streaming applications and allows Fi to control the costs of offering roaming data at that price. 

Same reason T-Mobile limits domestic data roaming. It costs and they want to limit losses while still being able to advertise that they offer the service.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your statement is nonsensical. Please clarify. We were discussing data rates and throttling. 

You assert it's a function of the foreign carrier and delineated in the roaming agreement. Then you went into subscriber authorization when roaming and stated that's a function of the APN. Now you're onto blocking or allowing subscribers by IP address? How would that even work? If the APN doesn't permit a subscriber to attach they never get an IP at all. </TEXT>

Note that data throughput is not mentioned anywhere in the SLAs, only the ability to attach to the network. 

The foreign network has zero interest in limiting or throttling roaming data. It's a great source of revenue for them. The home carrier does the limiting (if any). AT T does not limit data rates because they charge for roaming data. T-Mobile does until you purchase a high-speed package. That's done at their APN. Fi limits at their APN.  

Also, what Speedtest measures and what is actually received isn't always perfect as you know. 140Kbps is within the margin of error for a 128Kbps link. As for my Fi data rates, all I will say is that they were significantly above what is advertised. I do not know if this was intentional. It was obvious throttling was still in effect, but at a higher rate expected and experienced earlier in the trip. This was consistent for every country I visited.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Registration and denial do not happen at the APN and the APN has no control over whether a mobile is permitted or denied on a network. That occurs at the HSS, which will also contain any geographic and/or subscriber-specific restrictions on roaming.  

The APN can only control whether the subscriber is permitted to attach to a PDN and to which PDNs the subscriber may attach. If the HSS clears you but the APN doesn't, you get voice and text but no data. T-mobile is not a limiting factor on speed insofar as their network likely isn't being used. The backbone between the APN and the foreign network may be a limiting factor but that is not specific to T-mo or Fi. 

Sprint and USCC are irrelevant in this context because they are not used while roaming abroad. Their SIM profiles are inactive.Given that you know so much I see no need to define acronyms for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why exactly are you so certain that Fi cannot work as advertised? I've verified it does over 8 networks in three countries. The fourth, Fi wouldn't connect because it's not included in the flat-rate roaming area. 

Bandwidth management is a basic function and contrary to what you seem to think is not a function of the roaming agreement. On Fi, T-Mobile, and AT T; no matter where you connect in the world, your data flows back to and from the home APN. This is why you can stream Pandora and other US-centric services when you're abroad but using cellular data. The home APN is what does the throttling of speed, not the foreign carrier. Were that not the case how exactly do you think T-mobile could administer the high-speed roaming data packages they offer?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just got back and did so this last trip. For reasons that don't concern you, I have AT T, T-Mobile, Vodafone UK, and Fi. Even if a local carrier has service, the backhaul to the home APN can be congested and impact data speeds. So results will vary wildly. That said, I never saw T-Mobile exceed ~140Kbps measured while roaming and I chose not to buy a higher speed data pack because Fi never failed.

EDIT:  Also, Fi does have control over their roaming services. They seem to piggyback off T-Mo's agreements, but if they merely mirrored T-Mobile's service they could not exclude countries where T-Mo offers roaming such as Jordan. Fi use their own APN, so they can control data speeds, authentication, etc. </TEXT>

I've had many cases where the primary vendor that comes up is a third party because they priced a few cents lower than Amazon. Got burnt on a Nokia 808 that way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No issues with business services being more expensive. Huge problems with Comcast representing a building as wired, only doing a survey after and then refusing to provide services because it "won't pay back" despite the customer relying on Comcast's assertion that the building was served, then doing a bait and switch for more expensive fiber, THEN not getting the installation done for ten months after that, THEN trying to hold the customer to the contract after utterly failing to deliver service.  </TEXT>

Adding insult to injury, Comcast offered to run fiber, at four times the monthly price. The company agreed, and then they *still* didn't get the installation done. The company opted to move when the year lease was up, told Comcast not to bother installing, and this happened. </TEXT>

<TEXT> With a normal SIM, that switch allows you to turn off data use over the mobile network when not on your home network and/or a network your provider designates as 'non-roaming'. Fi seems to override this behavior and always tells the phone you're on your home network, even when out of the country; because either you're in an area with the same data pricing as at home, or you can't roam at all. 

In the US, from the phone standpoint the same is true. You never 'data-roam' on Fi. Although in the US, data isn't charged separately off-network to on whereas internationally it is. Either it all comes out of the big 'ol bucket or you won't have access to data although in the US you may have places where you have voice and text but no data whereas internationally I don't know of anywhere this would be the case. 

Upshot is; in my experience that switch will never have any effect when using Fi. If you want to shut off cellular data you have to untick the "Mobile Data" box.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Partner seems like the only network that has information and services in English. I'm here in Israel right now and prepaid services are everywhere but there's a ton of packages and it can be confusing. 012 Smile seems like the best international deal going. Partner seems to be the only company offering prepaid services in English. I have no connection with them and did not use them.

That said, I decided to use Google Project Fi. At $.20/minute for calls to the US and $10/GB for (slow) data wherever they offer roaming, it's been great with zero hassle. But unlimited 4G/LTE speed data for 30 days seems to be available for about 200NIS or just over $50 from Partner. Killer deal.

<TEXT> The 5X roaming issues are only with the Sprint side and CDMA roaming. Sprint no longer does CDMA roaming internationally at all. Any roaming is through T-Mobile, and Fi's roaming partners seem to mirror the countries available under T-Mo's Simple Choice. Samoa and American Samoa are not covered, so you'll have no roaming. 

My shortcut to see if I'll be covered now is to search the country on T-Mobile's site.If it comes up as pay per use, I know Fi isn't going to work there. Jordan and is also in that group. 

EDIT: And... I was wrong. The Fi website states American Samoa and the Northern Marianas are at standard rates and don't even list Samoa.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> vent
Long story (kinda) short; Currently overseas for an extended period of time. I have family members in the country I'm visiting that I haven't seen in many years. One of my cousins just had a wedding this past weekend; because the parents of the bride couldn't host me (lots of relatives came in), the father of the bride booked and prepaid a hotel room for me. Incredibly nice gesture, especially considering I could've gotten a taxi ride back to where I'm staying for less.

Upside: The res is at a property flagged by the chain I frequent. Downside: He. Booked. With. Expedia. So no points, no benefits, nada. But hey that's ok. No examination of gift horses in the mouth.

Wedding is shortly after one, so the plan is to be dressed already, go to the hotel, drop my bag and check in later if an early check-in isn't possible. Get there, get in line to check in, and this tall wiry bespectacled prick is just raising hell with the FDA about not being able to check in. Mind you, it's noon. 

He's going on and on about how his flight was delayed and then baggage took forever and the line at border control was forever and then he couldn't get a cab and nothing in this fucking country ever runs properly and on and on. Then the reason for the rant; why can't she give him a room? He's a Platinum and he's never been refused before and they're required to give him a room and he DEMANDS he be checked in right now. After a few attempts to calmly explain the problem, the FDA gracefully excuses herself to go get a manager. Guy then turns and says "I've been a Plat for five years running and I can't believe they didn't have a room ready for me. Totally unacceptable." No doubt he expected backup and support of his entitled attitude.

Well bruh, you opened the door. I said, "Well... I made lifetime last year, and have been plat every year since '01. I've never known early check-in to be a stated benefit. I have luck about 50% of the time if I try to check in early. Whelp, I gotta drop my bag and get goin', now that I know early check-in ain't gonna happen" and walked off. It was as though I'd popped him with a pin. *PFFFFFFFFFFFT* deflated. 

Not sure what was more irritating; the guy haranguing the FDA and dissing the country (which is an incredible place) over normal travel issues, or the embarrassment of sharing citizenship with this asshole.

ACL, concerts in Central Park, large graduation ceremonies, etc. 

The exclamation point means that you're connected but not passing data. There's simply too many people trying to connect and pass data and the resultant overload renders the network useless.

<TITLE> For the lurking hotel guests; here's how to go about attempting to cancel without penalty when you have no rights to do so. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-13 21:00:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This may not be appropriate for the TFTFD sub; however I know the sub gets lots of lurkers (including me) so this may be helpful?  
  
The situation as of twenty minutes ago; booked to stay tonight and tomorrow, made mistake and only need tomorrow. We're past cancellation w/o penalty time. Note; this WAS NOT a prepaid res. Those operate by a different and far more inflexible set of rules. What to do??  


First off; stay as far ahead of the problem as possible and, if you can, call during business hours when someone is around that can authorize exceptions. 

If you can't or find out too late?? Don't pitch a fit; call to preserve the next night's reservation and call back the next business day to politely ask if anything can be done. Thou shalt not screw with the folks on the front line for doing their jobs when you didn't do yours.   

This was a few minutes ago after the FD punted me to someone authorized to make a decision:  
 nbsp;

    
   
    R:"Thank you for calling East-in 'Gigantic Proprety', this is [Revenue Person], how may I help?"

    Me:"Hi there, I've screwed the pooch. I have a reservation checking in tonight but just found out I only
    needed tomorrow. I believe I'm past the cxl w/o penalty time. Is there anything you can do?"

    R:"Let me check...clikity...it's no problem, we'll just make it one day and you won't be charged 
    for tonight."

    Me:"I cannot thank you enough for your help, I greatly appreciate it."
    
    R:"Not a problem at all thank you for staying with us, have a great stay!" 

 nbsp;

Now if they'd said no??? I would've taken my lumps knowing I made the mistake. But going in with honesty, zero attitude and zero expectations is your best chance of getting the property to help you out of a self-made situation.

Outboard decoders don't seem to be a thing, HDMI audio de-embedders only convert LPCM to analog, DD+ is universally only passed through.

<TITLE> How to fix the sound on the Dell XPS 15 9550 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-12 16:18:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just got the thing yesterday and love it, but was dismayed by how bad the sound was. Could Dell really have muffed it that badly? I was determined to at least make the best of the bad so I started noodling with settings, going into the Microsoft enhancements inside the driver, the Maxx audio settings, etc. I think I've come up with a solution that actually sounds decent and allows you to use the full volume range with a minimum of distortion.

Here's what you need to do:

* Go into the **Dell Audio** desktop app, and click on **Speaker/Headphone** at the top.  
* Turn OFF **MaxxBass**  
* Turn UP **MaxxTreble** to taste, I have mine set at 95.  
* Turn OFF **MaxxDialog**   
* Turn OFF **MaxxStereo**  
* Try **MaxxVolume** ON or OFF. It's compression, I don't mind it so I keep it on.
* Use **MaxLeveler** as you wish, I have mine turned off because I hate normalization.  
* Next, click on **Equalizer** on the left hand side.  
* Click the **On** switch  
* Set **31Hz** at 0.7 or to taste.  
* Set **63Hz** at 2.1 or to taste.
* Set **125Hz** at 1.3 or to taste.
* Set **250Hz** at -1.4 or to taste.
* Set **500Hz** at -0.8 or to taste.  

The reason to notch those frequencies is to avoid where (I think) the speakers are resonating with the chassis.

Enjoy! I think it actually sounds quite good this way, has a bit of reach into the bottom, doesn't sound tinny and most importantly DOESN'T crackle constantly! But still does on occasion. Hey, as awesome as the rest of the machine is, I'll take it!

**EDIT:** There's a software parametric EQ that totally replaces the WAVES Maxx software and allows you to make very precise adjustments to the equalization. It also has a pre-amp function so you can boost the volume to your heart's content. It's not the most user friendly piece of software but at first blush seems to work very very well.

<TITLE> Currently have Acer V7-482PG-9884, Want 13-14" replacement, $1300 budget, in US. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-09 19:48:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> * **Total budget and country:**   

$1300, US

* **Do you prefer low weight, a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick any that apply.**  

2 in 1 not important, I prefer great performance, decent graphics, good battery life, and mid-low weight

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.** 

Windows

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**   

13-14" IPS/AHVA/IGZO (just not a TN really)

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.**   

Some WoW, some Adobe Premiere

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**   

Primarily WoW, would like to achieve 30FPS at Ultra

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**   


Prefer Synaptics touchpad and solid build quality/non-flex keyboard. Very much want good sound quality from the internal speakers. Realize I may be looking for a unicorn that doesn't exist. I currently have a 1TB 2.5" SSD and a 512GB mini-PCI-E SSD in the current laptop so the ability to move those over would be awesome. 

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**  


I currently have an Acer [V7-482PG-9884](http://www.anandtech.com/show/7238/acer-v7482pg9884-review-everything-you-need) and love it even though it's not perfect. I'd prefer something with a better keyboard (the Acer's really isn't great although it isn't bad). But overall the laptop is extremely well rounded with good graphics performance, very good battery life, good speed, great screen, and surprisingly good sound.  

The size and weight for all this are perfect (13.31" x 9.33" x 0.84-0.92" and ~4.3Lbs). So, any help is greatly appreciated. I've been looking at the Aorus X3 in thoughts that the V4 will be discounted now that the V5 is out, but don't know if that's a suitable replacement.  Any help is greatly appreciated.    </TEXT>

She doubles over laughing, and it's at that point I realize the guy is one of two dads and overheard everything. I just quietly wimped out and slunk away.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When last we left off **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/44watd/you_only_need_one_circuit_it_uses_a_smartjack_so/)**, our intrepid something or other was trying to figure out how new ISP *YellowRunFastShortDistance* was going to squeeze a quart of bandwidth through a pint-sized pipe. I'd just called **Regional Manager** (RM) and let him know that issues were indeed afoot. **Chubby Sheriff** (C) had buttoned things up, laughed at me yet again, and bounced off on his merry way. We're now something like a week from cut-over. 
 
 nbsp;

____________________________________

I'd called RM towards the end of the day, so wasn't surprised when I didn't hear back from him until the next morning.

 nbsp;

RM: OkWe'veTaken**MilitaryToilet**OffYourCaseAndYouWillNotBeHearingFromHerAgain.  
  
Me:I appreciate that. So did y'all figure out how to transmogrify a T1 into a T2, do I have more circuits coming, or are we going to use [IPoAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers) for the rest?  
  
RM:IPoAC?  

Me:Nevermind.   
  
RM:YouShouldBeHearingFrom*NewDeathStarBabyBell*ByTheEndOfToday,SoundGoooooodsubject3599?  
  
Me:Wow, how'd you pull that one off?  
  
RM:PleaseLetMeKnowIfYouDon'tHearFromThemThankYou**clik**.    
  
  
 nbsp;
  
  
No sense of humor, that one. But, true to his word, I did get a call from a scheduler over at *NewDeathStarBabyBell* telling me that three circuits were to be installed the next day.  
  
 nbsp;

Bright and late shortly after lunch, **Chubby Sheriff** and his **PFnotsoY** roll in after a lunch of pantagruelian proportions. I only know this as they were talking about it for thirty minutes after they showed.  
  
C: Gawddayum! That thar place'ut jus' opened up'th road dishes sum mean grub amigo. Four ench-eye-ladas fur six bucks, haw!  
  
PFnsY:*Nombreeee*, vato you wouldn' kno' good messican food if it hit you upside th' head. I had hungry man dinners better'n that shit. 

 nbsp;

and so on... 
 
 nbsp;



**PFnsY** was a junior (though not much younger) tech for *NewDeathStarBabyBell* and very diligent and hardworking if not the sharpest tool in the shed. When I'm having to help figure out how to use a [T-berd](https://www.valuetronics.com/detail/Used-acterna-t-berd-107a.cfm?gclid=CJeEwaGL_coCFQIKaQodo_sOvg), all is not well. But so long as things weren't too wacky he got the job done the times he was dispatched solo and had learned enough by the time **Chubby Sheriff** retired to manage. He was also self-described "La Raza" and supposedly rode with the [Bandidos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandidos_Motorcycle_Club). So, not someone to feck with unless it was good-natured. But, I digress. 

 nbsp;

Their end of the install comes off without a hitch, **Chubby Sheriff** and **PFnsY** take their leave, and I hop on the horn

At the instruction of **Military Toilet**, I hadn't connected the router to the one circuit that was installed. Time to fix that.  
  
 nbsp;
  
Me: Hey *RM*, who's coming to turn this thing up? 
  
RM:{silence}...{insert hemming and hawing and prevaricative strategy formation here}  
  
Me:See, there's this clause in the contract that states you guys will be responsible for installation and administration?
  
RM:Uhmmm...UnfortunatelyThatWasToBeAssignedToAServicesTeamThatWasToBeSetUpInYourRegionButThosePlansWerePushedBack.
  
ME:...so you're coming down to install this yourself? It's going to install itself by magic? You have yellow oompa loompas instead??? That you're telling me this now means you knew you didn't have anyone to install it and still don't.   
  
RM:Well...Yes.  
   
ME:*sighhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh*...(holding my head in my hands)...I haven't even so much as looked at the router thinking y'all had taken care of everything. Is it at least configured?   
  
RM:Well...No.  
  
ME:OK...(deeeeeep sigh)...I'd prefer not to sue y'all. Send me a new contract for the same term of time without the installation language, with a 7x24 4 hour service restoration SLA, at {$200/month less than agreed} and we can avoid buying our attorneys new cars. Y'all already waived all the non-recurring charges so there's nothing to do on that front. Get me someone who knows what they're doing with an IOS config and I'll get it running.  
  
RM:ICan'tDoThatItsBelowCost.
  
ME:Do you remember why you cut things to the bone in the first place?  
   
RM:Well...yes.  
  
ME:I'm going to provide referrals as agreed. Whether they're negative or positive is contingent upon you.

So I go climb up to the box graveyard, dig around in the Cisco box, pull out the lovely baby blue Cisco console cable and proceed to get PuTTY running on an older Dell 1U [EDIT: Dell PowerEdge 1550; 1Ghz PIII] server that I'd been too lazy to remove from the rack. All hail King Nine Pin Serial! I'm greeted with:  

    Please answer 'yes' or 'no'. Would you like to enter the initial configuration dialog? [yes/no]:  
  
Well, feck, I guess **Regional Manager** wasn't kidding.

[I've run out of time, the conclusion is to come.]

**TL;DR: Installation? Sure we'll install it for you! PSYCH!**

<TEXT> Not in the industry but very sympathetic. Was checking in at a starry wooden property late last Thursday and had the misfortune of being in line behind one of the biggest fecktards I've ever witnessed. Typical middle management type, more important than anyone in the room, etc.
  
  
So, feckyboy (FB), goes off on the poor FDA because he didn't get his upgrade, the rate is wrong, blah blah. As he's blowing his stack, he mentions something like "Look, I'm a Platinum, I work for XXXX healthcare, we're a huge customer and if you don't get this fixed I'm going to have our travel department stop booking here!" 
  
  
Just so happens I know quite a few people at XXXX healthcare as I've been friends with one of their senior executives (let's call him David) since he was a peon. I also am on a first name basis with the CEO (we'll call him Ron) and his wife. All of which I put to good use when I interjected and said "Oh! You work for XXXX? I've known David for twenty years; in fact I just saw 'em at Ron's surprise birthday party about two months ago. Funny, I don't recall meeting you there. What was your name again?"
  
  
I almost felt sorry for the guy;  the color drained from his face as he turned around and stammered out a halfhearted greeting and tried to salvage what was left of his dignity. He didn't mention his name, but FDA came to the rescue by brightly piping up "OK **MR. FECKYBOY** WE HAVE YOU ALL FIXED UP! YOUR XXXX HEALTHCARE RATE IS NOW IN THE RECORD AND I FOUND YOU A KING ON THE STARRY WOOD FLOOR SO YOU'LL BE NEAR THE LOUNGE! WILL YOU NEED ONE KEY OR TWO??" 
  
  
FB meekly squeaks out "^^onlyonethankyou" and FDA ssssslllooowwwwwwlllyyy points out the room number on the key folder, rate, where to find the lounge, what tomorrow's forecasted temps will be, breakfast, wifi info, moon phase, winning lotto picks, etc etc etc all as sweet as can be. Finally, she hands over the keys and FB practically sprints off but not before I can call out "Pleasure to meet you Mr. Feckyboy! I'll make sure to tell Dave I saw you and let him know you're working hard!"

Must credit the FDA on her professionalism... she didn't say a word about any of it. But she did profusely apologize that no upgraded rooms were avail though I didn't ask, and somehow I ended up with four drink tickets. 

I haven't decided if I'm going to pass this along to 'Dave'.\

<TITLE> You only need one circuit. It uses a smartjack, so it goes to Eleven. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-09 12:44:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A bit of backstory: 

 nbsp;
  
  
Way back when, I was one-man IT for a family business. In the early days of the internets (think pre-WiFi, DSL and Cable when people still debated the merits of modems and Rockwell HCF modems were the bane of the existence of many), I was tasked with Getting Us Online. What to do? We had no network, and I had no budget. Cue 10base2 ThinNet strung about, 'cause the equipment was available for cheap back then (100bT was becoming the norm but was still expensive and Gigabit had just dropped and was unholy expensive) and hubs (much less switches) plus stringing cat 5 would be way more costly than RG-58.

 nbsp;
  
  
So now we were all wired up, with no-place to go. Bless the powers, they accepted my explanation as to why a ton of dial-up was Not The Answer. But, what then??? Unfortunately, the facility was hell and gone from *NewDeathStarBabyBell*'s nearest CO, so a T1 was right out of the question. T-spans back then were (and may still be) charged by distance for the physical circuit, and access (be it voice, data, etc) was separate. The quoted loop charges were insane even if I could get access for cheap. But this new-fangled service, called ISDN, was NOT subject to a distance-based loop charge. For those unfamiliar, ISDN was sold in many places as 2 64k [B]earer channels for data and 1 16k [D]ata channel for signalling. I figured 2 ISDN lines, or 256k bandwidth, should work. 

 nbsp;
  
  
Sadly, said LEC's internet offering wasn't very advanced, and couldn't do bonding. They charged by channel and connect time. So that wasn't gonna fly. Plus, this was a bit of a podunk area and innovation was thin on the ground. I, somehow, managed to talk a local ISP into leasing us a spanking new Cisco 1720 with two ISDN cards for cheap and rolling that into monthly dedicated bonded service. They were primarily a consumer dial-up ISP (first in town with 56k which is why they could also offer ISDN), and in the evenings throughput definitely dropped but when we needed the bandwidth it was there. 

 nbsp;
  
  
For a year or so, this was OK. But then Flash started becoming a thing, web pages were becoming more image intensive, and Broadcast.com was growing popular. None were core business functions but what the powers want, the powers get. And the powers wanted bandwidth. This was perfect timing; $ISP was getting commercially shaky and the service grew progressively flaky. Meanwhile *NewDeathStarBabyBell* had recently started offering Frame Relay dedicated access in our area significantly more cheaply. So out went one 1720 and in came another. This time, we had to supply the router and I had to configure it. So I learned a little IOS. This will become important later. But for now, bandwidth was quadrupled, our users rejoiced, and we carried on.  


 nbsp;
  

Another year and a half down the road, and the screaming begins anew over the slowness. By this time we've got servers and printers and devices galore hung to hell and gone. So, it is Decided that we'll do it right this time, and the Cat-5ization begins. But, our contract with *NewDeathStarBabyBell* doesn't run out for six months, so while we can redo all the infrastructure and be ready to move, we can't actually switch until then AND we'll have to have both running for about a month. They wanted MMMMOOAARRRR SPPEEEEEEED, so all was blessed.


 nbsp;
  
  
**At long last, we get to the story:** *YellowRunFastShortDistance* telco was mounting a big push in the area to gain customers and had been by to see about picking up our dedicated voice business about a month prior (we did a metric crap-ton of inbound toll-free 800 service). 

 nbsp;
  
  
I called the 'rep and said if we got a deal on a 4xT1 circuit, I might be amenable to switching things up when our voice contract came up in about a year. She came back with a price that was equal to what *NewDeathStarBabyBell* would've wanted for the T1 loops alone AND threw in a shiny new Cisco 26something (think it was a 2621?) to handle it all. They were going to handle provisioning, install, everything, and the router was their problem. So they said.

 nbsp;
  
  
Problem: *YellowRunFastShortDistance* wasn't very good at provisioning and had a bad working relationship with *NewDeathStarBabyBell*. I wish I'd known that earlier. Two weeks before the planned cut-over, I still didn't have an install date for the circuits even though the router had already been installed and mounted and was merrily blinking away into the nothingness not connected to a damn thing. This will also be important later. 

 nbsp;
  
  
Increasingly impatient calls to the "network implementation team" and my "implementation specialist" were met with platitudes and insistence that all was on track. The name of the implementation specialist? **I kid you not: think military term for a toilet, with an A appended.** From here on out, she shall be Military Toilet.

 nbsp;
  
  
So finally, FINALLY, *NewDeathStarBabyBell* install tech shows up. I know these guys well, I love these guys, they love me. I frequently send them home with freebies and have cellphone numbers for 'em all. Chubby Sheriff (C) is the one that shows up today. 

 nbsp;
  
  
I call him that 'cause he kinda looks and sounds like a fat Sam Elliott. C has a serious enchilada-fuelled paunch, deep basso profundo voice with a drawl to match, full greying beard, and an honest-to-god handlebar moustache with no hipster-wax required. 
  
  
 nbsp;
  
  

C: Ok, amigo, I gotcherdown fur a T-span teh them sunzabitches. Whyyydjew take them anyhow??
  
Me: Offer I couldn't refuse, you guys were $$$$ more a month AND they threw in the router.  
  
C: GAWDDAMN!!! Welp, we gawdda pay fur all us beeeaaayyyuuutiful techs like this prime spec-I-men ri'cheayah (right here)[slaps his stomach which continues gyrating for a longer time than expected].  
  
Me: Waitasec Sheriff, did you say 'A' T-span?   
  
C: Ayup... wun T-juan, hawt, fresh, 'n made tuh order.   
  
Me: Uhhhhhh, that's supposed to be four there, amigo. I ordered cuatro so if this ain't it I'm sinko-ed.  
   
  
 nbsp;
  
  
  
C calls in and verifies the order is correct. I whip out my trusty Ericsson T39 and whistle up Military Toilet (MT).  
  
  
 nbsp;
  
  
  
MT: *YellowRunFastShortDistance* network implahmentayshuns, this Military Toilet.  
  
Me: MT, we have a serious problem. *NewDeathStarBabyBell* is here and they have an order for ONE circuit. Not four, one.  
  
MT: A'ight, jus' calm down, you know we been tawkin' bout 'dis fo' weeks 'n sumtime da ordahs jus' get put in rawng(wrong). Imma check.  
  
Me:The. Orders. Get. Put. In. Wrong? Aren't you the one that enters the order??  
  
MT:Aw nawwww, we gots uh carrier implahmentayshun leyeaisayon (liaison) team dat does dat. Y'all in uh *NewDeathStarBabyBell* area 'n I cain't put in dem ordahs.*clicketyclacketyclicketyclickety*  
  
MT: MMk, it sez jus' one. Imma call dem. Hol'don.*CLIK*{...calls so clear, you can hear a pin drop...}  
  
Me:(muttered)Motherf*cker!  
  
C:Son, looks like yah's gettin' whutcher payin' fur.  
  
Me:Y'know, we have really big sharp air-knives around here, how much do you like that beard?  
  
C:(laughing)Uh huh, yer sawed off fat ass and who's army?  
  
MT:{...and with our fast clear*CLIK*}M'kay I done tawked t'them 'n they say ya only need wun circut.  
  
Me:**WHAT!?** A T1 line is 1.5 megabits a second. The contract is for 6 megabits.  
  
MT:Naw dis is new, we gawt this thang called a Smart Jack. So it do it all wit' one.  
  
Me:(...stunned silence...)  
  
Me:Did I hear you correctly? A T1 can carry 96 channels of bandwidth because you use a **smart jack**?  
  
C:(doubles over laughing hysterically)  
  
MT:I don' know nothin' 'bout no channels, 'dis ain't cable!  
  
Me:...so no other orders exist.  
  
MT:Naw, dat's all ya need.  
  
 nbsp;
  
  
Now, the sales rep had brought her regional manager along for the call, and he'd given me his card. Thankfully I remembered this right about now and rushed Military Toilet off the phone. As a rule, I never give techs or fellow support people hell. Sales people do not get this courtesy when things go wrong. Sales people are frequently the source of things going wrong.  Called Regional Manager up and raised utter hell.  
  
 nbsp;
  
  
RM:ThisIsRegionalManagerWith*YellowRunFastShortDistance*HowCanIHelpYouuuuuuuu.  
  
Me:This is subject3599 with [redacted], get me someone in engineering, implementations or whatever the **F CK** you people call it that knows what the **F CK** they're doing because Military Toilet, whom you assigned me and assured me was TheBestThingEver just tried to tell me a T1 can carry 6 megs 'cause it uses a, are you ready for this, SMART JACK! We only have one circuit being installed.  
  
C:(loses it and quite literally ROFLs)  
  
RM:ThatCan'tBeRightI'llGetRightBackToYou*CLIK*
  
 nbsp;
  
  
So, Chubby Sheriff, sore from laughing at me, installs our lone circuit, and graciously extends the demarc (Demarcation point, where telco hands the circuit off to you) to the network room. 
  
 nbsp;

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Years ago, I was quite involved in an active online community of analog audio hobbyists. People would occasionally put hardware and music up for sale on the message board we used. I'd been looking for a specific piece of hardware for several years to no avail. It was extremely rare and had never been sold in the US, so any examples would've been imported from Japan. One of these machines 'popped up' for sale from someone in the community and I jumped on it. 

The guy offering it wasn't new but wasn't terribly active. Somehow he'd obtained pics that weren't on the 'net and/or not easily searchable and ginned up a fake Japanese bill of sale. In hindsight, he may have seen one for sale and stolen the images from that. Regardless, it all seemed legitimate enough to induce me to go through with the transaction. So, PayPal sent and he says it'll ship in about a week. Then, the excuses begin. From he's been busy to out of town to his 'assistant' shipped it but didn't send the tracking number to providing a fake tracking number. Then, he just quit responding to calls or emails. Turns out the number he'd given me was a forwarding service that he subsequently disconnected. He also disappeared from the forum. He had, however, used his real name and a real PayPal account. I filed a PayPal claim, and of course they denied the claim on some technicality. I'm sure he was counting on this occurring. 

This is where the revenge begins with an unintended bonus. All I wanted was to make sure the guy knew I'd find him and get to him. I'd called the police and reported matters but they couldn't have given less of a damn.  I decided to find him myself, and found an old wedding announcement that'd been posted on the 'net. I searched his wife's name and found mention of her being out on leave to give birth to their first child on her work website. BINGO! I had a small gift sent to her workplace with my name on it, and called her work to say that I'm an old friend and don't have their contact info but wanted to wish them congratulations on the new child, and that I'd come see 'em soon. I had visions of his wife saying how nice it is that someone sent a gift to her work, etc and asking who I was. 

This apparently spooked him, because a cashier's check showed up for the full amount. Now, what he hadn't counted on, and I didn't tell him, was that I'd filed a charge-back with American Express after PayPal denied the claim. My conundrum was this; The AmEx investigation was ongoing, and I had no idea if they'd overturn the chargeback or not. I also had no idea if the cashier's check was legit; I've heard of counterfeit checks being returned up to 45 days later. So I truly didn't intend to profit off this. But I did.  The AmEx chargeback was resolved in my favor, which PayPal clawed back from his account, shortly after the check was proven good.

The kicker is; the guy had the gall to Email and threaten to try to have me charged with fraud for the chargeback when he'd already sent the check! I simply responded and said "HEY! Great to finally hear from you! Glad you're doing well, how's the baby? Listen, I'm sure there's just been a mix-up and I'll be happy to pay everything just as soon I get the machine. I'm sure you understand why I want to receive it before I pay at this point. Of course, if you do want to call the police, you're welcome to explain to them how you attempted to defraud me by selling something you never possessed in the first place. Your call." 

Never heard another word. I just hope his kid didn't have to go without diapers. 

TL;DR: Scammer temporarily got one over on me. I got that one back and ended up with a bonus. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **DISCLAIMER:** While I worked for a wireless carrier and frequently worked with reps and supervisors, I was not a rep myself.


**A bit of background:** years and years ago, no such thing as a nationwide wireless/cellular network existed. On a trip from, say, New Orleans to Houston, you'd go through five or six different coverage areas. Some were owned by major corporations, others were regional or even locally owned. Many smaller operators ran their own customer service locally.

One Friday after work I got a wild hair and decided to head to Lake Charles to see a buddy that'd moved there a few months ago, never mind the five hour drive. Met up with him and we went for the casino boat. At the time, call delivery systems were in their infancy. You had to dial a * code to tell the system you were there and to send calls to you. Except this wasn't working for me, as I found out when I stepped outside after losing a particularly large blackjack hand. Checked voicemail and had a stack of messages, but the phone hadn't rung. So I 611.

CSR: "Thank you for calling Cellular One of Lake Charles, my name is Janet, how can I help you?" (Not a real name)

We go through diagnosing the problem (I used to work for a carrier) and determine the home system is having an issue. Nothing can be done on this end. She's being professional about everything but something just seems... off. Midway through this as we're waiting for I-can't-remember-what, I ask Janet how her evening is going. "Oh...*ragged intake of breath* fine." 

Once all is said and done she goes into the wrap-up script and I blurt out "You sure you're ok?" "Oh yes, I'm...", and then just loses it. In the space of about two minutes a volume tumbles out about divorce, custody battles, working nights, etc. Midway through a sentence she stops and, "I... I ... am so sorry, I didn't mean to blurt all that out, thank you for calling Cellu..." I interrupted again and told her not to think a thing of it, that sometimes we just need someone to listen. I then gently asked about call recording and metrics (as I mentioned earlier, I worked for a carrier back then). 

Turns out; small company, rudimentary metrics {that were ignored for the graveyard shift), and the recordings were only retrieved in case of subpoena, emergency, or a customer complained of egregious behavior on the part of a CSR. We compared notes for a few more minutes, then I bid her a good night and told her if she needed an ear she knew where to find me. Astonishingly enough, she did. We ended up becoming friends, although I lost track of her years ago. 

I miss those days. Everything is so centralized, sanitized and scrutinized now. I suppose it makes for more consistent standards, but there's a certain human factor that's been eradicated. If you've read this far, thanks for reading my random ramblings.

<TEXT> Obligatory "this wasn't today". Way back as a small child when we'd go to religious services the congregation had an older woman who took care of the building,etc. She was cantankerous as all hell. Us being elementary school age kids we tear-assed around constantly and she was always screaming at us to get back into the service. Our parents, OTOH, were only too happy to have a moment of peace.

Well, during services she'd be in the kitchen preparing whatever snack was to be served after services. The kitchen was off a large hall/auditorium that echoed in the most awesomely cavernous way. So we'd sneak in to the auditorium, wait until it was dead quiet, and abruptly scream our heads off. It sounded something like a bunch of very loud angry Pikachus in a cave, but it would shock the hell out of that poor woman and she'd come running after us. We'd sprint off laughing all the while. Until...

The last time we did this, everything began as it always had. Snnneaaakkk quietly in (the doors had very creaky hinges), creep up to the door of the kitchen, wait until a deadly quiet moment (the kitchen had a speaker so the service could be heard) and BBBBBBBBBLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGHHHH!!!

So our poor victim comes tearing ass out of the kitchen as ever yelling all the while, we tear outta there, and then we hear her voice falter and get quiet. All we heard was this gasping and heavy breathing. So one of the braver of our group (I was a pussy) went back and saw her sitting on the ground in a daze breathing heavily. The kid had the presence of mind to go up and ask if she was ok... and she said no. (I'll be damned if I can remember his name.) The fun stopped at that point.

We all went in and got our parents. One kid's father was a cardiologist. That probably saved her life. We were angrily shooed away, dragged back into the services by our mothers, and sat there utterly silent and still.

Now, I grew up back in an era of "spare the rod and spoil the child". We had none of this "time-out" stuff. It was a hand, a switch, or a belt and we all knew that tone of voice. That tone of voice was in constant use that afternoon. When we finally got home, my ass got tanned more thoroughly than a homeless guy in Phoenix in August.

**TL;DR: Little shits had a shout and caused a heart-out. But all's well, she didn't go to heaven or hell.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lots of new vinyl enthusiasts out there and LOTS of companies out there offering far more form than substance. Many of these look very nice but aren't built as well as you might think. Before you decide to 'upgrade' from a used 'table to something else, don't get caught by the marketing. Here's a look inside the Onkyo. For reference, this build quality is about equal to the mass produced tables made by a company called BSR back in the '70s and 80s which isn't very good. The difference, BSR wasn't sold as a premium product which (some of) these are.

http://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/viewtopic.php?f=18 t=76490#p634042

Specifically note this [picture](http://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/download/file.php?id=16034 mode=view), which depicts the tonearm and the wiring to the RCA jacks. Note the wiring, soldering, etc. I'd expect to see that on a $30 plastic job, not a $200+ turntable. 

The cheapest new 'table I know of that's good quality is the U-Turn Audio Orbit, at $179. Cheapest good preamp I know of is the ART DeeJayPre which can be had for ~$40-45 with good Google-fu. So for the price of an AT-120 you can have a truly decent turntable which has proper support and can be upgraded if you wish.

<TITLE> TIFU by ignoring a speed-zone </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-22 04:59:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As common with TIFU, this was several years ago. The family biz for which I worked was in the dark ages and still added many things on paper before shipping their products. This despite having to add many thousands of numbers a day. Lots of overtime.

**TL;DR : No sleep in recent past, work called me in with bombast, went too fast, cops put a sling around my ass, but all worked out and I went home with a hall pass**

So, about Y2K they decide to enter the 1980s and fully adopt barcoding to do away with hand-writing. They used barcodes for some items but not others. Cue much work involving an entirely new product coding methodology, new hardware, software, the works. In short, CHANGE FUCKING EVERYTHING! 

So it's go-live day. I'd been at the office 16-20 hours a day the previous week doing shakedown testing, chasing down issues, you name it. Due to an unforeseen issue, the night before go-live I was at the office until 3 AM. I decide to go home and change. That was my first FU. I'd arranged to have coverage that morning as I knew I was going to be useless with no sleep. That was my second FU.

Now mind you; we'd done weeks of training. Everyone knew the new hardware, everything was in place, we were ready to go. It all worked. Even printed up laminated instruction sheets and posted them all over the place reminding everyone how the new barcode scanners worked. I'd arranged for backup to be there in the morning given my late departure. I was due to go in at 9. So I thought. Phone rings at 6:45AM... "DUDEWHERETHEFUCKAREYOUWECANTLOGINWEREDOWNGETHERENOWWWWWWW!"

Naturally I fly up, throw on clothing, run out to the car and begin my impression of a bootlegger running from Johnny Law. At the time I had a fairly decent car with a big-'ol V8 that put down lotsa HP. Power in this instance was not good. I go shooting down one of our main thoroughfares through a speed-zone that ostensibly protects a pedestrian area. There's (quite literally) a shitbox Dodge in front of me and the passenger is flashing a light at me. I'm too focused on other stuff to heed this warning. My 3rd FU. I whip around the guy and I go flying right by a building. And its parking lot. Which was full of police. And the shitbox Dodge was an unmarked car. Speed zone was 20MPH, I was accelerating through 88MPH. If only I'd been driving a De Lorean in a lightning storm.  No, I'd run right through a speed trap.

Five, count 'em, five police cars rushed up to flank me as I pulled over. I knew I was in deep deep DEEP trouble. I grabbed my insurance and drivers license, turned off the car, put the keys in my pocket and held the proof of insurance and DL out the driver's side window. 

Four police officers walked up; one guy starts laughing and says "Could you step out of the car please sir?" Sure, why the hell not, I'm going to jail anyway. The shitbox Dodge driver storms up, gets right in my face and goes off on a tirade about how I could've gotten someone killed, what the hell is my problem, etc. I said precisely zero as I had no defense. Sure 'nuff, "Put your hands behind your back please..." and to the back of a cruiser I go.

Now, TILO (today I lucked out) as my cousin happened to be driving by and was giving a friend of his a ride to work. He recognized my car and pulled over. After a short discussion with the officers, it was decided that rather than tow my car, he'd take it with him. Always preferable to a tow lot. Being polite to the Police can pay some dividends. 

For some reason, the jailers took mercy on me and didn't stick me in the holding cell, but stuck me in a holding cell of my own. May have something to do with them not wanting to see me get killed on their watch? 

Used my one phone-call to get 'hold of a friend who's also an attorney and I was bailed out. Went to court a few weeks later and explained it all to the judge; requested a deferred adjudication and explained the situation. Hizzoner reasoned that as I wasn't racing and may not have been in my right mind due to sleep deprivation that I should be given the benefit of the doubt and deferred was granted. Thus, my insurance company remained none the wiser. 

After all that? I got to work to find everything running perfectly smoothly. The bonehead that'd called me just forgot how to power up the scanners. My cousin wasn't the only one that saw me on the way to work so I ended up having to explain myself. After everyone finished laughing their ass off, the big boss mercifully sent me home to rest.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Years ago, again, I worked for a family business. I primarily was responsible for IT, but was the only one who had a passport and was willing to travel. When something came up that required overseas presence, I was tasked to head over. 

We had some preliminary sniffings-around in Brazil that required someone on-the-ground briefly for meetings and inspections. I'd best describe it as quasi-due diligence. Round trips in coach were un-cheap at almost $4k per trip given the need for flexibility and refundability. ($Boss learned to permit flexible tickets after a $400 ticket to Arizona for training turned into $2500. Fare differences and change fees FTL.) 

Sneaky bastard that I am, I figured out that I could fly down to Brazil on a one time one-way ticket, do what was necessary, take a day flight back to Miami, connect to a flight to London, spend Saturday day and night in London, and fly home Sunday, with the return to Brazil set for months in advance and able to be changed at will. In Business/First. For less than the coach fare. The trick was buying the ticket originating in Brazil.

So I do this go-round  4 times. I'm having a blast; go down, visit, inspect, get taken to dinner, fly out the next morning, hang out at the Miami airport for 3-4 hours watching some of the most amazingly beautiful women in the world, do London, and home. All goes off without a hitch.... until the last trip I'd take. 

Turns out despite initial appearances all was not as represented and I reported back the bad news. I was told to continue on with the trip but that we were done with that. Here comes the FU. For reference, these trips occurred over the course of about 6 months at one every 6-8 weeks approximately. This was the fourth trip.

I land at Heathrow, suffer through immigration while dragging my carry-ons (checking luggage is a mortal sin for any trip under 5 days in my book) and am walking down the hallway to customs where I'm addressed by two gents waiting in the hallway, shown credentials, and asked into a side room off the hallway. 

Now, I've walked down this particular hallway many times. I never wondered at it's purpose before. It's a fairly wide nondescript hallway with walls on either side that do not quite reach the ceiling and opaque glass panels. At this point I discovered that the panels slide aside to reveal... interrogation rooms! One gentleman requested permission to search my luggage which I permitted and the other sat down and gestured towards a seat across the table for me. Luggage guy slid the wall panel back into place and it was as though I'd disappeared. 

Interrogations guy introduces himself as being from MI5 or MI6, I can't recall, it's the agency responsible for UK security. He proceeds to pull out my passport and start flipping through pages:

*Him: Travel a lot, do ya? (Imagine a mild Yorkshire accent)  
Me: More than I have in the past, certainly.  
Him: This all for work?  
Me: No there's quite a bit of personal travel in there too.  
Him: And all the travel from Brazil to here? It's very peculiar you know; you always go from there to here, you always stop off in Miami for a fairish long connection, and you always fly from here back to the States. Tha's not a normal travel pattern, now is it? I canna make any sense of it at all.   
Me:Blame $Airline. It's cheaper for me to do it this way than to fly back and forth to Brazil from the 'states and I get a side trip to London out of it and it's not in coach.   
Him:Have you ever been arrested or convicted of any drug-related offenses in the US?   
Me:Nope  
Him:Please wait here, I need to verify a few things.*

He and luggage-boy left for about 30. I did feel for the poor bastard that had to go through my dirties considering clothes get REALLY funky after you've worn 'em through a long-haul flight. At any rate, they both came back and the Yorkshireman says: 

*Him: Ok, your story checks out, you're free to go, enjoy London.  
Me: Should I expect the same hospitality every time I visit?  
Him:Especially if I'm on duty, I'm afraid. Although next time we may pull out the rubber gloves.*

I laughed at that, he didn't even crack a grin. I was disinclined to stick around. With that, I turned wordlessly to the table, grabbed my baggage, and walked out the wall which he'd graciously slid aside. People walking through were rather shocked to see that rooms were there much less someone coming out of them.  

Epilogue: Went back to London about 6 months after that trip to meet up with friends. Nobody even blinked an eye. Haven't had an issue since. So, for now, I've been spared the rubber glove.  

**TL;DR: Flew hither, thither and yon; Brits thought I was a fel-on; stopped me to see, found naught but clothes made dirty.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Years ago, I worked IT in a family business. We did business with Dell and others but tried to keep costs down so would occasionally buy parts from reliable secondary sources. One day a local IT/consultant type calls and says he got a deal on some new in box Dell drives (18GB SCSI hot pluggable 15k RPM in the proper drive trays if memory serves) for half what Dell charged, did I want any? Uh, HELL YEAH! We needed more drive space anyway. 

I go throw the drives in a spare server to test them before migrating everything over and one won't spin. Call the guy up and ask if they're under warranty. "Oh sure, just call Dell, they'll exchange 'em." 

Here's where the FU begins. I called Dell and they say no problem we'll send out a call tag etc etc.  The next day, instead of the call tag showing up,  I get a call from our receptionist that two FBI agents have arrived and would like to see me! I headed up front wondering what the flying f*ck this was all about. 

As I later found out, a FedEx (or UPS, I can't recall) truck full of Dell parts and computers got hijacked and this drive was part of the shipment. All the FBI would say was that the drives were stolen property and they were investigating the matter. We had to turn over all the drives and when asked where I'd bought them I pointed 'em straight to the guy where I got 'em. I do not mess with the FBI. 

Bro calls in a panic the next day profusely apologizing and begging me not to sue (which I'd never thought of doing anyway, I didn't think HE had stolen them). He even drove out and refunded the money we'd paid in cash after I told him not to worry about it. He said he wanted nothing to do with that. Never did find out if he'd gotten what he paid back from whomever he'd gotten the drives from. 

**TL;DR: Bought some cheap drive; the FBI did a drive by, the hot drives they did fly.** </TEXT>

Art got ever smaller. Cassettes never had much space for art. Flipping through a CD booklet was never gonna be as cool as checking out the gatefold.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Several years ago, I travelled a lot for business. I was heading from Santiago, Chile to Madrid and using a cheapo Round The World ticket (6 continents, unlimited mileage, $3800 in First thanks to a major currency crash at the time). First was overbooked and they offered me the difference in cash between First and Biz to downgrade. I thought they meant the difference in the Round The World ticket, which was about $400. I declined. Only after they found a volunteer did I learn that it was the difference between full fare tickets and I would've gotten back ~$3,500. Kicked myself right in the ass for that one. </TEXT>
