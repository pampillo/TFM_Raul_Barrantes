<TEXT> I started with VBA, turns out it lacks the strict structure of C# and other languages, but it's easy to learn and you can do some pretty bad ass things with it. Just imagine what you want to do with your program and google the shit out of your idea. I'm pretty sure you'll find someone who's laid it out for you. Look at their examples, study what it's doing and apply it to your program. That's how I learned. Overtime you remember these techniques and they become second nature. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's convenient, kids love it, and cheap. I have places I love much more, but my favorite when I'm too tired to cook breakfast (my fav meal to cook) is McD's. I can't even remember the last time we went out for breakfast. Before kids I loved checking out new places, but life changes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They do but there is a lesson to be learned about respecting others, including animals. They should also realize that all actions have a reaction, good or bad, and that bad decisions can lead to bad reactions. Obviously if the dog ever harmed the kids we would have to get rid of her, but she has yet to seriously harm anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like calling off work and just playing games all day.  This brings back so many memories. It's like having a mini arcade with all the games you grew up with. I just played a little NBA Live 95, some Shadowrun, F-Zero, and Rock n Roll Racing. All played just how I remember them. I really appreciate all the help everyone has provided and especially the main guys who made this easy for the rest of us. I don't plan on going extreme with the modding, I just enjoy playing the games. Having the option for SNES and Sega is just mind blowing.

I apologize if this post isn't relevant to anyone, I just wanted to share. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I tell the kids, if she bites you it's on you. We tell them not to bother her. If someone was screaming and running around like wild animals I'd be on edge to. I think she's losing her hearing also because she's very jumpy even when I touch her. We'll make sure she lives out a happy life. She was cage trained but I can't stand a dog in a cage all night so she sleeps with us. Her favorite times of the day are her morning potties with treat after and going to bed at night. She's a good dog, just not a child friendly one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My kids tried that with our dog, within 6 in. of her bubble her teeth would show. Every inch they got closer her mouth would open more. What a bitch.

EDIT: Pic of Mrs. Mimi https://imgur.com/a/k6fyb
She is 13 years young

Our kids are little, and she hates kids. Why get a dog that hates kids when you have kids? Well we took care of her after a family member was contemplating on putting her in a shelter because she didn't get a long with her kids. To be fair, Mrs. Mimi was raised with cats, so the cats are to blame .  After we took Mrs. Mimi we started having kids of our own. Now we are a loving family with personal bubbles. </TEXT>
