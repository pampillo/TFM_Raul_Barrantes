<TEXT> My cousin is severally autistic, and on a side note my aunt loves him to death. He's just about the nicest guy you'll meet.

I remember when I was younger I was hanging out with his brother, my other cousin, playing PS2 and Raymond (my autistic cousin) got in an argument with my uncle. He stormed out, when he returned about half an hour later he brought back Jack In The Box and insisted on giving me one of the burgers he bought and sat down to play PS2 with us.

I'll always remember that day because my uncle was always such an asshole to him but even after a fight with his dad where he went out to get some food to feel better he insisted on sharing some of his feel good food with me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to take some time to carefully plan out my next story, thanks for the tips. I actually LOVE the Search and Rescue series, which isn't too relevant but I thought I'd throw that out there since it was mentioned.

Like I said I've done quite a bit of fan fiction, but never any horror and especially no original nosleep stories. I'll do some experimenting with writing styles, thanks especially for the feedback with that. I do enjoy the first person self narration style so I may mainly try to improve on it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Smiling Woman </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 09:17:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I grew up in a small desert town, it was hot, dry, and not a whole lot to do for a kid. Explore a whole bunch of nothing out in the heat, or stay in doors with the air conditioning and play video games, were about the two main choices. Many of the teens, once entering high school, I'm sure  did a lot of damage to their livers considering it had become tradition to substitute the boredom of not having much around with excessive partying.

My grandpa was a kind old man who made the best of our dreary little town. Hed often skip the local bar to head up to the Native reservation and drink at their bar. Ive heard stories in my adult life of Natives, when on their reservations, not being too kind to outsiders. Here it was different. I presume it may have had a lot to do with the fact we knew to respect them, if people from our town went up to one of the watering holes on the reservation we knew to be nice and if got a bit crowded we needed to be the first to leave. If any of the adults, like my grandpa, decided to go have a few beers up on the reservation they knew to not be rude, dont start any fights, and just enjoy the company.

But anyway, he always brought back odd tales and folklore to tell me on nights Id spend a night over at his house . See from a young age I had a fascination with the creepy and bizarre, dont get me wrong it ended up giving me more nightmares than I can count but it was worth it at the end of the day. One night when I was about 10 years old I was staying the night with him, we did the usual tradition. He drove me about 20 miles to another rag of a town that was lucky enough to have a McDonald's, got me my usual and himself something to eat, we enjoyed our meal, then headed back to his place.

By the time we got back it was night, which meant it was time for him to tell me some piece of creepy Native folklore, or some odd first hand account he was told by a Native during his weekly visit to the bar. To the best of my memory the story went like this:

When the White man first started settling around these parts the Natives protested, much to no avail, and they soon had almost no land to call their own. After going through every avenue they had to try and stop all of this, a local shaman laid a curse on them. That one day a child of the White man would bleed onto the sacrificial stone sealing their fate. An ancient spirit would be summoned to chase the White man off their land. It would be a shapeshifter that would steal away all their children, any new child brought onto the land or born on it would be stolen until only the Natives remained.


I know, I know. Not very scary to an adult, or hell even a teen. But at 10 years old it gave me goosebumps anyway. I proceeded to ask him an onslaught of questions, all of which he didnt really have an answer for. I mean he only knew what he was told after all.

Fast forward a couple months and it was summer time! No more school for almost three months, just video games and the odd trip to a watering hole to get some swimming in. The day it all started just happened to be one of those days. My mom and my friends mom (who happened to be friends with my mom, again small town) decided to take us up for a trip to swim. Happy as could be I got ready, swimming trunks on, goggles ready, sun screen forced onto me, and we were ready to go.

After several hours of swimming I decided I wanted to go exploring considering the fact the watering hole allowed for fairly dense brush and trees to grow for someways, maybe several football fields or so, and that was rare for where we lived. I ran off without a second thought besides yelling to my mom, Ill be back! to which my mom responded Only 30 minutes! And be careful! Giving no response to that as I looked behind me to see our parents talking and my friend enjoying the water, I disappeared into the brush.

I was having a grand 'ole time pretending I was The Crocodile Hunter off to catch me a croc our two. Yes this was before he died, I always loved Steve Erwin. I ended up slipping on a muddy patch of dirt and cutting my hand on a rock. I inspected it closely, there was a bit of blood but not too bad. Giving myself the thumbs up that I wasn't too hurt I continued on my journey. I came into a clearing where there was a fairly big rock and a little less vegetation than everywhere else, it didnt seem too odd to me as I figured the fauna were simply starting to thin out as I got further away. I climbed up onto the rock, one hand after another, until I stood on top.

Im king of the world, I yelled pretending to hold a sword up, much like He-Man, and staring into the sky. I sat down on the rock while holding the sides, letting me catch my breathe again. After all that exploring I was starting to get quite winded. Finally I stood up, deciding to head back so I could get I just a bit more swimming before we had to go home.

We stopped at the Natives bar (and grill) on the way home where our parents picked us up delicious (if you ever had a burger from a decent bar and grill youll know no other fast food quite matches it), but very greasy, burgers and fries for dinner tonight. Once home it was business as usual, little bit of TV, then bed, I didnt know at the time my life would never be the same after I woke up the next morning.

I normally would have slept in until about 10 AM on a summers day, but my mom woke me up at a way too early 8 O'clock.

Son, did Billy come by last night? I yawned and rubbed my eyes, wondering why my mom would be asking that.

No, why would he have? I thought they went home too after swimming, I replied starting to get worried as my brain slowly booted up.

Well, they did sweetie. But Billys parents woke up to find he wasn't in bed, they wanted to check to make sure he didnt sneak out to come over here. They only have to assume he ran away now.

What? Billy would never do that, there was no way Billy would run away, he had no reason to and he just wasnt the type, he would never want his parents and friends to be worried over him. The next several hours consisted of the Sheriff coming by to ask me questions that I had no answer to, my mom sitting by the phone worried sick and hoping for a call letting us know my friend was okay. Nothing ever came.

The sheriff claimed there was no evidence of forced entry, no finger prints that shouldnt of been there, no sign of a struggle or violence. The odd thing was Billys windows were closed and locked from the inside, all the doors remained locked and not one key missing. There was almost no way for Billy to run off but leave everything in the state it was. A key needed to be gone, or a window unlocked, but nothing.

A couple weeks went by and I was still heartbroken over my missing friend, but to make matters worse another kid had disappeared. A girl this time, a couple years older than me though so I didnt really know her. She on the other had had disappeared during broad daylight while walking home from a nearby friends house. Needless to say the town went on high alert, kidnappings just didnt happen where I lived. The sheriff promised to get to the bottom of things though and neighborhood watch went on steroids. The adults of the community set it up to where once an hour, after 8 PM, someone would drive the streets of the town at night to make sure everything was okay. They had agreed upon who would take what nights for the first two weeks, and if this wasnt solved by then theyd decide what to do after that. Everyone agreed to keep an extra eye out and pay extra attention at all times too.
The sheriff, who was actually rarely in town, could be seen driving the streets often now sometimes even later into the night. A curfew had been set, for anyone under 18, of 7 PM. 

My parents tried to keep me from hearing too much, to not scare me, but I heard bits and pieces of the gossip surrounding her disappearance. The most noteworthy thing was about a week before she went missing she had started talking about how  The Smiling Woman kept trying to get her to play. Of course her parents, at the time, chalked it up to an active imagination and, in hindsight,  I think they werent too worried about a woman. Now if it had been The Smiling Man they probably would have been a bit more alert.

It was a few days after the girls disappearance when I was lying down for sleep, my parents double and triple checking every window and lock in the house, when I heard a tapping at the window. Like I mentioned before even back at this age I had a fascination with the weird and bizarre which gave me a bit more bravery, or maybe stupidity, than I really deserved. So instead of running to get my parents, I went to the window.

Outside was the oddest thing I think I may have ever seen, a woman wearing some type of skin tight purple suit, oddly red hair that wasn't any shade Ive ever seen naturally on a person, and a huge smile that was too big for her face. Thinking about it as an adult I figure it was this thing trying to fit into a world it didnt quite understand. Choosing odd accessories and a smile that caused more fear than it did soothe.

Come play with me, she said in an unnerving childlike voice. I was a bit shell shocked at the moment so instead of running or screaming I just kept staring at her.

Come play with me, I promise youll have tons of fun. I have toys and candy. Your friends are here too!

Something about it mentioning my friends knocked me out of the state I was in and I let out a blood curdling scream and ran for my parents room. They were already half way to my room when I ran into them. The Smiling Woman, shes here!

My dad grabbed his gun before running outside ready to empty his clip into whoever he ran into. But as you would expect, no one was there. The sheriff was called, I told him my story and they checked around the house. No evidence of anyone being there was found, no foot prints, no finger prints on my window seal, nothing. Thankfully in light of recent events the sheriff and my parents took me much more seriously than they normally would have. Once the sheriff was gone my parents let me sleep with them.

The next day I was outside playing in our backyard, my parents wouldnt let me more than 20 feet from the house, when I saw her, it, again. She was across the empty lot behind our house, probably 40 feet away or so, but I could recognize her even from that far. I knew I should run back to the safety of the house but it was like something supernatural forced me to stay in place. She slowly got closer, her walking was weird, way too fluid is the best way to describe it. Like movements so precise and so perfect no human could do it. As she got closer I noticed her hair seemed a more natural red color, but everything else was still the same. Once she reached me I was still unable to move, I knew in this moment I would die.

Come play with us, she said while holding her hand out to me, your friends are here! And I promise to bring more, youll be able to have fun forever. It was odd, despite being scared shitless I had the urge to agree and take her hand, and this time there was something oddly soothing about her despite her disjointed appearance and smile that was still too big for her face.

When I noticed my hand had involuntarily made it half way to her is when I finally managed to snap out of the trance and ran screaming back to my house. Only my mom was home as my dad was at work, but it was a rinse and repeat of last time. Sheriff came out, my testimony documented, search of the place to turn up no proof anyone else was there, and then nothing. Thankfully I heard my parents that night talking about moving, they considered several options including my mom and I staying at my aunts in Oregon while my dad got the house ready for sale and continued to work while looking for a job in Oregon. Of us all staying here while they found us a house somewhere else, and a few other similar ideas. Ultimately they decided to look, with my aunts help, for housing and jobs in Oregon while we all stayed here waiting, and if another incident happened my mom and I would head for Oregon early. 

A couple days actually went by incident free and I was starting to hope I had seen the last of The Smiling Woman when talks about a kid going missing in the town I mentioned with the McDonalds in it. I almost expected this to put my parents over the edge and for us to leave but I think the fact it didnt happen quite so close to home this time prevented that. The day after that news spread through the town both my parents had to be at work, my mom had been staying home a lot lately but they warned her if she didnt go in today shed be fired, and my dad couldnt get the day off in such short notice. They made sure to have an hour long talk with me about stranger danger, staying inside, keeping the doors locked, etc.

I had been playing my PlayStation for several hours when I heard a knock at the door, immediately I went on high alert. I walked to the door and looked through our peephole to see nothing, so I tried to ignore it and went back to my video games. Another knock at the door, checked the peephole and no one. Before I could sit back down again ANOTHER knock, so this time I turned around and threw open the door ready to punch and kick whoever was there. No one. My nerves on edge I turned off my game and put on TV hoping to get lost into some cartoons when I heard it.

Come play with me, I looked towards the hallway to see her standing maybe 5 feet from me. She had changed again, her smile now fit her face correctly and looked more sweet than sinister, her tight purple body suit was now a purple dress. I felt fear rise up in me, but not nearly was much as before. Now stronger than the fear was a feeling to trust her, she only wanted to play after all.

I got up and started walking towards her, not really realizing what I was doing. Youll have so much fun, Billy has been talking about how he misses you, the mentioning of Billy set off a few panic alarms but the feeling of trust and kindness just radiating off of her stopped it from bringing me to my senses. 

Ill bring more of your friends too, youll never be lonely and everyone will always be happy, I was standing in front of her now but thankfully the bit of fear in me kept me from taking her hand. What about my parents? I asked not wanting to leave them behind.

They cant come, but dont worry I promise Ill love you more than they ever could, something about this finally snapped me out of it and I screamed. This seemed to upset her and, no longer in a soothing voice but a raspy deep one, she said Stop! Just take my hand and come play, theres room in my stomach for all you children! I ran past her, it, through the door and just ran and ran until I reached my grandpas house.

After calming me down and getting water in me so I didnt keel over from heat stroke I told him what happened. He called my parents who both left work, no longer caring about their jobs. It took them a long time to get here since both had about a 40 minute drive to work, the sheriff arrived before they did. He also got my statement and checked our house. Of course there wasnt anything really to be found except an open door and monsterless house.

What my parents never told anyone was they had setup video cameras around the house just in case. They wouldnt let me view them but whatever was on them convinced them to say fuck the house and we all noped out to Oregon.

I never saw the smiling woman again after that, weve never been back to the town I grew up in either. My grandpa moved to Oregon to be closer to us and I tried my best to not think about those events. Though the story doesnt quite end here, a few years after that after I was in high school and had become a normal functioning teenager I found a VHS tape that was just marked with tape over it. What was written on the tape made my stomach drop, The Smiling Woman. I knew I had found whatever had been recorded that day, and curiosity got the best of me, despite always doing my best not to think about her, I popped the tape into our still functioning VCR.

It showed me standing in front of nothing, but what was important wasnt what it showed but the audio.  It was the conversation I had with her that day, but the entire time her voice was this low raspy beastial sound. Like halfway between a beast and a person, she never had a soothing voice at all. I'm not sure why she didn't show up on video. Last I heard about where I grew up was that a huge chunk of land was returned to the Native reservation, but until then a steady string of child disappearances continued. Oddly enough they stopped after land was returned, this made people suspicious that someone from the reservation took on a vendetta against "the White Man" but no suspects were ever brought forward. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of the older folk had a lot of weird stories, mainly about lights in the sky, this is no joke, thanks to those lights we had quite a bit of people convinced of aliens and UFOs around.

Occasionally I heard someone, here and there, tell tales about things they saw on the ground though nothing matching what I saw.

Lots of weird shit happens in the desert though, or maybe the heat just got to us all eventually. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry it took so long to reply, sleep and then work.

I live in WA state now, I don't really go back home often and I'd rather not ask either of my parents to ask around as that'd require some sort of explanation to them.

Old Native American tales would trickle down to us though, I don't really remember them very well nowadays to be honest. Next time I do go back home I may try and do some asking around though. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Desert camping </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-08 06:36:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I grew up in a small little Arizona desert town, were talking no rain some years, dirt as far as the eye could see, as hot as 120 degree summer highs, 90+ degree summer nights. So yeah, not a place a whole lot of people would want to live. Which always made me wonder why my parents moved us there when I was an infant of only 2. Sure crime was next to non existent, though I personally felt the rattle snakes made up for that. 

Anyway, I didnt come here to bore you with the woes of growing up in the desert. No, I came here to share what happened to me when I was about fifteen years old or so. My friends and I loved to explore the desert, there were lots of canal ditches for water run off (when it did happen to rain it could end up raining hard, causing flash flooding and all that), abandoned buildings/houses (often in the absolute middle of fucking no where), annnnnd a whole lotta nothing. Though it was cool when you found the occasional coyote skeleton, or donkey skull, or stuff of the likes.

Some of the abandoned buildings could really have a creepy vibe too, though I chalk that up to a fifteen year olds mind and the fact anything abandoned can be creepy. If youve ever lived in a rural area youll know how much of the sky you can see, I live in a bigger city in Washington state now and you can still see a lot of stars but my god it doesnt even come close to the desert. But youd also see a lot of strange lights in the sky, I still to this day am almost positive my friends, myself, and some older people of the town, saw experimental aircraft being used by the government. I mean testing in the middle of absolutely fucking no where would make a lot of sense. I mean UFO alienish (though I am in no way claiming aliens) type shit Lights that would hover like a helicopter could, but then shoot off moving much faster than any airliner jet could. Though I have to digress, Ive gotten quite a bit off track of my story before even really starting it.

So one hot and dry summer night my friends and I decided wed go camping. No tent really needed, when we went camping wed pretty much go to a random site in the desert, bringing wood and etc for a fire (only you can prevent brush fires, when you make a camp fire in the desert you have to make sure that shit is out because what bushes and few trees are out there are dry as hell), with sleeping bags and supplies for food and water.

I was pretty excited for it but my friends ended up canceling, oh well not a whole lot I can do there. I still decided fuck it and ended up going on my own. So leaving my house just after the sun went down with my backpack full of everything Id need for the night. My parents still thought my friends were coming along, I didnt want to tell them the truth in case theyd refuse to let me go without anyone else. I mean they trusted me, they knew I know how to respond if I ran into a rattlesnake, not that there is too much worry of that after dark, not to play with scorpions and all that fun stuff.

I hiked maybe about 2 miles into the middle of no where before I decided where I was at was as good as any other spot. Now this was 2005, cell phones existed and even more towards town you could get coverage. But kids didnt really have phones in these days and where I was wouldnt get coverage anyway. Back then (like it was so long ago, haha) you had to rely on your own sense of direction and landmarks to not get lost, not that no one does that nowadays but yeah with GPS+Google Maps+ coverage just about everywhere now theres not a whole lotta reason too. I had headed north towards the mountains far off in the distance and knew how to get back by heading in the opposite direct. If I accidentally headed too south west or east I would still eventually run into train tracks, all I had to do then was turn north to orientate myself and head and then head east or west. From there it could get a bit more complicated, if lost, of which way to head but I knew plenty of landmarks both in the east and west so I should be able to orientate myself pretty well fairly quickly.  

Anyway, another huge digression and I apologize. So I set up my little camp, roasted some hot dogs and drank some water. I eventually ended up lying on the ground and starring up at the Milky Way, I used to love to be able to stare at the stars and get lost in them. I was also listening to music on my MP3 player (were talking 2005 here, Ipods and MP3 players were thankfully a thing even if modern cell phones hadnt obsoleted them yet). After enough time and several play lists, I found myself getting tired so I turned off my MP3 player and got myself ready for some sleep under the stars.

I woke up with a start, absolutely no clue why, I brought my wrist with my watch on it up to my face before hitting the button that caused a faint green glow to read the time, 1 AM. I pulled out my water to get a drink wondering what had caused me to wake up. Then I heard it, it was faint but definitely the sounds of foot steps off in the distance. I was alert now, I was 2 or so miles away from town in the middle of no where, my fire had been put out before bed but I wasnt worried by much. Coyotes did their best to avoid humans like a plague, there were no scorpions that were a real danger to humans were I lived, and donkeys werent going to mess with some guy sleeping. But the fact that something had bothered to get this close to me had me on edge. For me to be able to actually hear the footsteps it wasnt a rabbit or mouse. 

So I got up and pulled my flash light out of my pack, turning it on I shined the beam off into the distance. Some shrubbery, but that was about all I could see. I stood up turning around trying to check every direction as good as I could to see if someone was fucking with me. Nothing. I knew I had heard it though, through my head ran some stories that trickled down to our community through the nearby Native American reservations and tribes. I shook my head, I shouldnt be thinking of any of that right now, I didnt need to be any more wound up than I was already.

So I lied down on top of my sleep bag again and closed my eyes, if I could just fall asleep and wake up after dawn everything would be okay. But I heard it again, closer this time, off to my right. I grabbed my flashlight which I had laid down right next to me and jumped off turning it on all in one swift and fluid motion and shined the light in the direction I had heard it from. What I saw made my heart race, the silhouette of something human shaped, and eyes glowing green with the reflection of my light. I tried to scream, I mean I felt it build up in my throat and by all means I should have, but nothing came out.

And then it was gone, it got down on all fours like some type of canine, well more like a human trying (and doing a good job) imitating a canine, and ran off. My flashlight was pretty decent, I mean I could clearly see a good 30 feet in front of me before the beam got so weak that things became fuzzy with weakening light, but it was out of my beam of light so fast Im not even truly sure I had seen it at all. I was shaken up pretty badly now, I didnt even lie back down. I just sat. I opened up my second backpack that I had brought solely for firewood and ended up using the rest to build another fire. I mean someone HAD to be fucking with me right? Or maybe it was some demented serial killer? I shook my head. Not much crime happened where I lived, and when it did happen it was assault from drunkards fighting at the one bar in town that got enough people over 40 in it every night drinking the night away to stay in business. Even more rarely was a break in with a few things stolen while someone isnt home. But murders? They were unheard of.

So what was happening? Did my friends find out I was going camping anyway and decide to follow me and fuck with me? I wasnt sure but one thing I knew, I didnt want to attempt to walk home until it was daylight out. More time passed, I took a look at my watch again, 2:30. There hadnt been any more incidents yet and it should be light enough for me to feel safe walking home by 5:30 or 6, so 3 more hours of nothing happening and I was good. Of course, I wouldnt be so lucky.

Around 3 or so I heard the foot steps again. They were more constant this time, starting off in the distance and slowly getting closer. Fuck, fuck fuck fuck. That was all I could think as I held my breathe, they stopped, maybe 10 feet, 15 if I was lucky, from where I sat. I looked in the direction I had heard them, and just outside of where my fires light ended was a pair of glowing green eyes standing at about 5 foot 9 or so, about my height. They didnt move, just starring directly at me. Then it slowly inched closer letting the light just barely illuminate its form.

The closest way I could think to describe it is like a werewolf, Hollywood monster movie type. But that is just the closest, it had many differences. A lot less fur for sure, you could actually see scarred human skin underneath the fur, its head, while also hairy, was much more human that wolf. Its mouth was pulled back revealing very long and pointed teeth, those resembled a werewolfs more than a humans. It didnt howl or anything of the sort, and I was pretty sure this thing had no wolf of dog in it. It was something else. It did let out a low very inhuman growl before stepping back into the darkness and disappearing. 

What the hell? All I could think was it wanted me to see it, wanted me to know how fucked I was. Remember when I mentioned all the weird things you would see in the sky out here? Youd also hear weird shit at night, I think everyone chalked it up to coyotes and such things but I think I now knew what it was. I mean I had walked to friends houses, camped, etc before at night and never actually saw anything until now so it being much more mundane things like a coyote making very unique noises just made sense.

I sat there terrified now, like almost pissing myself scared. 4 AM rolled around though with no more incidents and I was starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Then I started hearing the foot steps again, it wouldnt come into the light this time but I could tell it was circling my little camp. Like a predator planning its attack on its prey. I had nothing to use as a weapon, no gun, no knife (if such things could even hurt it), so I knew if it attacked I was fucked. I mean, Id fight back the best I could but lets face it I would have been dead in seconds.

Then on all fours it ran through my camp, right pass me so close if I stuck my elbow out I would have touched it, and into the darkness on the other side. It was fucking with me now. I had heard of predators playing with its food, much like cats with mice. I wondered if itd wait until right before dawn to make its move. I wondered if it even really NEEDED to eat or just killed because it was something dark and evil.

4:30 now, it had been circling my camp non stop for the last half hour, sometimes stepping into the light to let me get a look at it before disappearing back into the darkness. 5 AM and I could actually see the sun starting to come up, another 30 minutes or so and there should be enough light to illuminate everything in a faint, but seeable way, if you ever stayed up to watch the sunrise youll know what I mean. I wasnt sure why I was still alive, it was still circling my camp, but just maybe I would actually survive this ordeal.

As that thought ran through my mind it stepped into the light again, straight across from me. It approached my fire, stare never wavering from me. It lifted its foot and used it to put my fire out. I smelt no burning flesh, no stench of burnt hair. Even with no flashlight on or fire I could see the green reflective eyes still, it hadnt moved an inch. I picked my flash light back up and turned it on shining it on whatever the hell this thing was.

It looked like it was thinking, always looking right at me. I stood up which made it tilt its head, but I didnt move to run. I didnt move at all, not an inch. I just starred it down, if I was going to die then I was going to die with a bit of dignity. Then, it backed away walking backwards much more fluidly than a person ever could. And it disappeared again. Between now and dawn I heard no more noises, no foot steps, nothing. When it was light enough I checked around my camp and saw so many foot prints, foot prints that were three quarters human and one quarter something else.

I made it home and never mentioned what happened, not to a soul before now. I figured no one would believe me anyway. Just some kid making up stories or too active of an imagination and got a bit spooked while camping. I never saw the thing again, I also never went camping again, not once to this very day.

I still wonder what the thing was, some government experiment that escaped a facility somewhere hidden in the desert? A real life werewolf? Or something dark and evil left over from some earlier time, when humans wrote of dragons, unicorns and krakens, or something even older than that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My experience, both suck. They both go down a lot too. I don't keep track of which is out more, though I'm sure there are 100000x websites that do. They both go down enough for me to just say they both suck in that area too. Speeds on both are pretty bad, somedays my PS4 downloads faster/more stable, somedays it's my XBone. It's very rare, no matter which one has ran better lately, for either to actually run well though.

Basically this (which one is worse/better) seems to have been a pissing contest for fanboys since the conception of online console play when in reality they just both really suck.

Like comparing rotten milk to rotten eggs. They both are really bad so to try to argue which is better of the two just always confused me

I can say in the free days of PS3, PSN was down noticably more than XBL, for me at least, downloading was still equally bad on both of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is very true enough, I personally feel this way myself. More or less at least. How I think it'll go

BE is effective at stopping cheating just from blocking? CIP is happy and botters, if they stop trying to cheat/keep playing as  manual players stay as customers

Bot develops a way to bypass BE but autotool gets them? Still win

Bot develops a way to bypass BE via updates but BE when updated knows who bypassed/botted (so an 'update' war) and CIPS auto tool can't catch it? CIP ways pros/cons of letting BE mass delete botters.

As long as between BE and CIP Tibia becomes virtually cheater free? Everyone but botters win.


But my OP was just in regards to the people who say CIP says BE won't ban at all, which simply isn't true. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To start, Tibia's forums aren't working for me so I can't provide sources/quotes, but you're welcome to just check official responses on the thread in auditorium anytime.

First Mirade said BE will block people from logging in who are using unofficial software and explicitly left out anything about bans.

When questioned further it was said BE WOULD NOT BAN AT ALL DURING BE'S TESTING PHASE but CIPs tool would work in tandem with BE.

When questioned again for after the testing phase it was stated "they could not provide further information at this time".

Yes, all this could mean they'll never allow BE to ban, only block but it doesn't mean they won't allow it to ban. It is simply up in the air right now.

I imagine if they do/don't allow it depends on a lot of things, including if BE does a lot of false positives in Tibia, if it'd kill CIP from losing so many customers they go bankrupt, etc.

I just see people everyday saying CIP explicitly said BE won't ban (with the implication of ever), which simply isn't the case. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 7.4-7.6 , but probably like everyone here I'm biased since I started in 7.3 but was so new the game I didn't know a lot of stuff until sometime during 7.4.

E.g. my first ever char I had a "circuit" of hitting up east Thais trolls surface layer, heading up to this 2 (I think 2) rot spawn near Femur Hills (while killing wolves, dwarves on the dwarf bridge etc on the way) and thought I was getting amazing xp. By halfway through 7.4 I was no where near as noob'ish and understood the game much better.

And up till 7.6 is because I have never enjoyed the game as much as I did from 7.4-7.6. I understand why CIP has made the game easier, this isn't EQ1 days anymore, most people don't want an MMO to be their entire life outside work anymore. I have mixed feelings about this myself, it fits in this day of MMOS and will be far more attractive to new comers (all MMOs need new blood, without it they will eventually die, it may be a long slow death, but nevertheless) but it isn't the same Tibia as when I started. </TEXT>

What BattlEye does, is acceptable and even needed for their purpose (FB doesn't need to datamine to fulfill it's purpose).

Not to mention FB actually collects a lot of data, unlike BattlEye where you really have little worry of anything being uploaded unless it's suspicious.

From what I read BattlEye is pretty invasive but it friggin works (lots of botters/developers try to discredit it or cause hyteria to push people to demand it's removal)

Despite being invasive they aren't wanting to watch everyone's 2 TB porn collection, or see their nudes. It's invasive to do its job, at worst you may end up with a .exe (or .dll) or two getting uploaded to them (if BattlEye  deems it as suspicious software).

For some people they will find this legitimately unacceptable, for me it's fine since I understand how these things work and know they really don't care about my personal files. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, I'm not trying to defend what they did. It was wrong and a huge problem with the video gaming industry right now. 

On the other, if a game development company does that, but tries their best to fix things through patch and updates I can get behind that. Which is why I was asking if it seems to be happening starting with the founders update. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know used it's really dirt cheap, but if I can pick it up new I'd prefer it to support the devs, assuming the updates they have provided are worth supporting them for. Basically it's that cheap new? When looking just recently cheapest I saw was 35$, which granted I may just not have looked hard enough.

I do like Minecraft, 7 Days To Die, and games like that so this is an interesting POV. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I, like many, was excited for this game but thankfully as a rule I never preorder.

Then of course the game launched, and like many, I wanted to cry but held hope with time and updates it'd become what it should of.

Basically, I know it's still not what was promised but has it gotten to the point where it's worth it? And I know this question will be very subjective, but hopefully some opinions can help me make up my mind. I've read as much as I can find about the update, and it seems it may, just may, be worth it now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ahh, to be fair a lot of people in more rural areas don't feel the deprioritization at all, it all depends on your tower/areas congestion. Some people roar past 28 gb pulling 20+ megabits/s steady all day everyday. Some people get lowered to a crawl till night, I'm more in between.

Also for unlimited 4g lte tethering it's pretty much the only option IIRC, though YMMV from congestion.

BUT I do get you're point. T-Mobile doesn't really have the network to provide truly unlimited (no deprioritization, which also to be fair is different than a cap but is hugely YMMV). I'm not sure if any network can handle absolutely no strings attached unlimited LTE to everyone at this point though, would bog down their backends on most towers to a crawl especially in just about any decent sized city.

Edit: Most months I end up (via cell phone tethering) burning through 50+ GB of data, mostly used on my PS4. And at only extra 25$ ontop of my base phone bill it's the cheapest way to tether that much.

Shoot, my highest month I tethered like 150 GB data, at 70$ base phone bill plus 25$ for one plus 95$ to tether 150 gb is friggin great. With Verizon that would have costed me like 400$. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty much the guy above me said, and not everyone wants to redownload/reinstall games constantly even if they do have good internet.

I just upgraded to a slim and already have over a TB installed. 

ESO is damn near 100 GB on it's own. TLOU is another 40, Until Dawn is another 40, DA:I is another 40. And it just adds up realllllllly quickly.

Edit: To be fair I said IMHO. I consider myself a casual gamer, pretty damn casual actually compared to many people I know (irl and online) and 1 tb isn't enough for me. 2 tb in the long run is pretty damn questionable, but works for now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know would if it offered a 40-50$ experience. I don't buy any game without extensive research first though. Shit only game I may ever preorder is TLOU2. I preordered TWD S3 by TellTale, but after rethinking it I cancelled my preorder and decided to wait for all episode releases and to read up first. At which point if it lives up to s1/2 I'll happily pay full price for.

Any, I got a bit off track but I think there is definitely a market it there for B+ through A (so one notch before AAA) games for that price point at release. Developers who risked it would have to approach it smartly though. You need enough features, polish, and gameplay without going overboard (to where they struggle to profit) but without under delivering too. Video game development is a risky business though so who knows if many will attempt it, much less create a market. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Better for sure, but I think a 39.99$ may have been the best point to go for between selling it for as much as they could/gamer value for what they got sweet spot. I was honestly thinking right after I posted my last comment that 30$ for the game just released may have been "too good" of a price. I think 49.99 is still "too high" personally though.

One things for sure, if they had released at/within first 6 months of launch they could have sold it for 60$ and go over really well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Which, if true, is fair enough. But with enough foresight (which isn't something easy to just have obviously) they could have sold it for 30$, once it was a couple years after launch, and had things go over way better at the game's release. Granted a lot of money had been sunk into it at this point and it may not have been easy as sell it for 30$, I dunno. I just personally think it would have bolstered sales and greatly improved it's reception. </TEXT>

I hope lesson learned by the devs is don't sink all your $ into uber amazing graphics, stepping down $ spent on graphics to offer a longer game, better AI, etc will probably go over way better with gamers. </TEXT>

Also you can keep doing the story over and just progressing further via paragon, online coop which is a bit dead but manageable if you really try, and rifts if you get tired of the story. An almost endless gear upgrading system, especially on console with no seasons (yet) to give free high tier gear. Plus all the different classes, it's easily a simple enough game to casually sink the next 3 years into it (people have easily done it). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a cell hotspot in itself but T-Mobile offers unlimited 4G LTE tethering via T-Mobile one with One Plus (70$ for base service, 25$ for One Plus addon) , with a few caveats.

First you need T-Mobile reception where you live ofc.



Next for the unlimited it can NOT be done via an "internet only" device (IE tablet or cellular hotspot) it has to be done with a phone with hotspot capabilities.

You can't use the phone only for Internet, you have to make a few calls on it a month at bare minimum.

Lastly if you go over 28 GB data usage you get "depriorized" which may not affect you at all, or if you're area is highly congested can have a pretty big affect. If you go over 28 GB in a month of total data also at least half must be done on the phone itself, not through the hotspot. IE if you use 58 GB hotspot you must use 59 GB data on the phone itself.

That being said I'm also in a situation where my only net options are satellite or cellular data and have found the unlimited 4G LTE on T-MOBILE to be friggin great, but YMMV with congestion, signal, and all the stipulations and how acceptable they are to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hopefully, but being honest I wouldn't hold my breath. I know on here and Xbox's own official forums/discussions it's been requested/talked to death and it still hasn't been fixed. But whether or not it ever gets fixed I agree it should.

I hate the intrusiveness of social media/social platforms period including XBL and PSN, like with FB I don't like how people can see when you read messages/are replying. Sure have it as a feature but allow us to turn it off, appear offline, etc. I don't post my life to FB (though not knocking those who do) and if I don't want to reply to someone when they send the message I don't need them asking 3 hours later if I'm mad because I didn't reply but read it.

And people who say if you can't live without these fairly basic privacy features says you should just delete/unfriend/block/cut out of your life anyone it happens with are just full of shit. It wouldn't get to that point if these features just existed and worked, and just because that is your (people who say just deal with it basically) problem we don't need these features need to realize they aren't some grand guru of wisdom and when they sayeth block/delete them it isn't some mystic all knowing answer that is an implied truth of life.

Anyway, sorry /rant </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I see this sub decided to get super judgy yesterday.

Appearing offline has been feature put into social apps (especially types of messengers) forever, it doesn't seem too much of a request to have said feature when it has been provided to work as it should (blocking others from being able to tell you're online).

And all the shit thrown at OP, geez you're telling me if someone's SO is a bit insecure/immature they need to break up? Sure a talk may be needed but that's up to them (OP in this case) not the collective mind of the internet.

<TEXT> I would call them, I bought a PS Vita game from my old ps3 on accident once. I called and they removed the license from my account and gave a PSN credit for what I spent. Granted I never even started up the game since I don't own a Vita, but they definitely can do refunds.

I'd just be nice when calling and hope you get a nice representative. I may have also have had a really good experience with the only time I needed a refund. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suggest going for it this is my comment a bit down/a reply to someone else

"I my first playthrough of DA:I was my first ever DA game, that being said terms like "The Fade" and etc I caught onto very fast. Without ever Googling any lore by my 15-20 hour mark I had forgotten I never had played any DA game before (15-20h is a long time, but my playthrough was like 76 hours so in context it wasn't that long).

It's an amazing stand alone game that may have you a bit out in the dark at first with terms and lore, but you should catch on really fast and should be having so much fun during that time (if you're like me) that it isn't too much of a bother to take time to take everything in."

I know A LOT of people suggest getting through The Hinterlands (first real zone) ASAP, tbh I feel like the only person on earth that enjoyed the zone.

Anyway I know this is a long tldr post but I hope you decide to try it, it is an amazing game. And afterwards if you're like me you'll want to go back and try 1/2. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd find it a bit unnerving, but probably not enough to recall it a few years later (not trying to say anything against you, just trying to put into perspective where itd fall on a creepy factor for me).

With that being said, I'm a 26 year old guy who's pretty big and probably has very little to worry about when it comes to abduction/murder/rape/etc and when I get into stents about reading unsolved cases and all that jazz I can get pretty paranoid myself. 

When you delve into the weirder side of things/strange disappearances that happen I think becoming paranoid is pretty easy. 

But if it makes you feel better it was probably a benign event that happened that was just a bit unnerving in the way it played out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems a lot of people rate games on $/hour. Personally if it's a REALLY good story I'll settle for around 2$/hour. Otherwise I feel ripped off if I don't get at least a dollar an hour. It's why I love RPGs so much, otherwise I wait for massive price drops. I love The Last Of Us, I knew I was going to love it. Still waited till I could pick it up for about 20$. Yeah the developers want good money for their time spent, but I don't wanna be raped on price for an 8 hour game either. I only really buy RPGs that I know I'll put 60+ hours into at full 60$ price. 7 Days To Die, Minecraft, Skyrim, Dragon Age:I are some of the best money well spent on games I have ever bought. Hell even The Last Of Us I've played through like 5 times, and the sequel may be one of the very few exceptions I make to the 2$/hour max.

Edit: Only things I go to the theater for are Star Wars nowadays. I don't go because it's such terrible money ratio. I'll wait till it's out on Blu Ray and price has gone down to 10$, and then I can watch it as much as I want. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NOT saying I agree with this, but to quote Scrubs "Every one of our parents does considerable emotional damage. And from what I've heard, it just might be the best part of being a parent." - DR. Cox

That being said, my parents weren't so great. I mean I was a little shit, but a lot of it was crying out for attention from them. In retrospect I have a good deal of respect for my mom and stepdad. They were far from perfect, but I was even further and they put up with way more shit from me than a parent should have to. My relationship with my mom has improved ALOT since I became an adult and I take responsibility for my part, as my mom did for hers. Now my stepdad... I still love him, he stepped up when my bio dad disappeared (who I now have a good relationship with) but I put him and my mom through hell and burnt my bridge with him. But live an learn, I like to think I'm a far better human being now.

Edit: I agree with a lot of people here, too many to list everypne/thing I do agree with. But I think the situation is complicated but we know a lot more about psychology now and hopefully we can become better as parents as generations go on. </TEXT>

But you're entitled to your opinion, it's just one I have never understood and don't think I ever could. I actually commend Microsoft for the play anywhere intiative and it has strengthened my faith in them as a platform developer (XBox/Windows). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree, but I remember at the time I did some Googling and found quite a few people were similar to me, but a lot got punished (services cancelled or a warning mainly) so it seemed hit or miss. I was in the lucky group thankfully.

Of course when cable internet was finally offered where I lived I switched to Cox and got a 60/6 (I think 6 up) line, I know the month after I switched I got a letter from Century Link saying they now offered bonded DSL in my area of up to 40 mbps and offered me a discount to go back. Even after their discount I was paying less for higher speeds with Cox.

I miss them both now since I can only get my cell tethering for high speed data where I am now. Bless T-Mobile and unlimited data/tethering.

Edit: I still wonder why they don't warn/cancel everyone. One theory I had was too many people go over the soft cap and they can't afford to do that or they'd lose a lot of customers (too many). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Something I always found interesting is I had Century Link (fairly big DSL/phone provider in the US) in Wyoming which had a 250 GB soft cap (done quarterly, so if you went over 750 GB in a 3 month period) in which I used a minimum of 500 GB to sometimes over a TB a month for a year. Never got a letter or call from them, never even got throttled even (which is good since it was a 15/.812 {I think .812 I know it was just under a mb} and throttling slower would have been a pain). 

I have to tell you I expected a letter every month. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Owning both I have to agree. PS4s has less going on but is so much easier to navigate AND runs smoother. I have a pretty old XBone so I dunno if newer editions or the one S improves this but XBone's GUI is so slow sometimes, and I power cycle to clear cache regularly. My PS4's, which is also a pretty old model, GUI is still fast and finding what I want is very fast.

On the other hand having more going on on the XBone does give the GUI some features the PS4 doesn't have so I guess it's a trade off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Born in '90 here and sometimes I feel my early childhood is closer to someone born in '85 or so. I DEFINITELY remember life with no internet, or computers. Then again I grew up in a small town where most families didn't get a PC before 2000-2002, and no broadband before 2005 when our cable company finally offered it. Dialup 'till then, no digital cable before 2003 or so though you could get satellite before that it was expensive and no one had it. 

I grew up on the NES untill I got my N 64 in 96, SNES /Sega only at friend's houses. So for me I remember a life pre internet, pre broadband, pre home PC. Though I guess I'm more of a fringe type in this case.

Edit to add no one I knew had a Cell phone untill 2005 (when I was 15) I didn't have one untill I was an adult. Though it wasn't too uncommon for parents to have one before '05. Mine did when I was probably about 13, many of my friends parents had them too. Only one or two of my friends had one before we turned 18 and got jobs though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They keep making it more of a pain to activate which annoys me.

First I had a "manage HD passes" on the front page of the mobile app.

Then I had to hit data, addons and then activate it.

Now I have to go to profilemedia settings. Technically it's as many clicks as the 2nd one but when it switched I was confused, took me 5+ minutes to find its new location. Why do they keep moving it/burying it? What was wrong with the original "manage HD passes" right on the front of the app?

I mean it seems they want to discourage one + users from activating it, which from their view I guess I can understand. They want to hold down the congestion from high data users, but they already deprioritize do they really need more discouragement than that?

Anyway I am happy with my T-Mobile One + overall. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember N64 games being like ~80$, PS1 new games were about 50$ but I thought that, was in large part, of the industry switching to disc based (way cheaper to make CDs/DVDs/Blu Rays than cartridges) games. PS2 (I got mine the XMas it came out, god bless my parents haha) I remember the games being 50$ USD at first but I know towards the end of the era them being like 54.99 new, maybe as high as 60.

I owned/played an NES/SNES growing up but we never got new games for them only used, and we didn't get an SNES 'till after the I had my N64 and the whole time we had our NES it was outdated by the SNES.

Anyway I never owned an OG XBox so I can't comment on it's game prices but everything I read says the cartridge days were MORE expensive than nowadays, especially when you account inflation. Those cartridges and SuperFX chips were much more pricey than discs, and on top of that less people gamed so they needed higher prices per customer. Anyway I know way to long of a post but my feelings on the current industry is:

1.
I want a 60$ game to feel like 60$ of content

2.
DLCs are fine but should be developed AFTER game release, if something is fully ready at release it should just be released with the game

3.
F* preorder bonus items/customes/etc see above

4.
DLCs should be priced right, if it's 20$ DLC it should have 20$ of content

5.
Cosmetic DLCs are fine (developed after release are fine, or at release if it is their only microtransaction and all future content patches are free - see Overwatch)

6.
Microtransactions like supply drops in full AAA priced multiplayer games are bullshit (looking at you COD)

I know this post isn't inherently about DLCs but the different "packages" and marketing of games but since others were weighing in I thought I would with my over lengthed tldr post.

<TEXT> I wasn't inherently saying bring them in, I was showing an example of where it is not just a time saving thing. I guess if my intent was that a better example would be if I go on long drives to unwind (I know people who do), I have one friend who likes to end stressful days by driving down this forested road by the ocean (example). I must apologize for that coming off wrong and hope I expressed myself a bit better.

On the other hand what you just said wasn't the implication I got from your post that led to this particular discussion. I thought you meant "if you aren't willing to learn to build a PC you shouldn't be allowed to play games" - "no time to learn, no time to play" would be a fallacy, a strawman (correct me if I'm wrong) to be exact. Implying if you don't have time ( which time is relative, people value their free time differently and semantically speaking could mean if they say 'I don't have time to learn to build a PC' could mean 'I have 0 interest in learning and console provides an experience I'm okay with and rather spend my free time playing a game than building the PC') to learn you don't deserve to play.

I admitted a few times in this thread I was wrong about the price issue, but that still doesn't really relate to this exact discussion we're having now. Also I know PC  console in overall performance and graphics, on the higher end side and even now on the sub 300-400$ side. That still doesn't mean that people who don't want to learn to build a PC by default should be completely excluded from gaming, this is in large part why consoles still exist.

<TEXT> Well don't have time VS don't want to. I personally think knowing how about PC hardware (bare minimum) should be mandatory but not everyone shares, or should have to share, this view.

Saying don't have "time to learn you don't have time to play" is also a bit of a fallacy. I don't (want to) learn how to fix my my car, many people would probably love to learn but don't have time, but it doesn't mean I don't have time to drive 300 miles for a vacation.

<TEXT> Anyone who tries to defend this (and I sadly see people in this thread doing it) need to get a better understanding of how the internet and it's infrastructure work. There's a reason wired (Sat. and Cell providers don't count here) internet companies have been charging for BANDWIDTH SPEED and not total DATA USED since the beginning of broadband (in the US at least). It doesn't cost an ISP anymore to deliver 10 GB or 5 TB of data, what will cost them is how much bandwidth is needed in total per neighborhood. My DSL I had to have living in Wyoming a few years ago had a 250 GB cap though, I always went over it (seriously every month I used 1 TB+ data between downloading games, streaming, etc) and they never bothered to even send me a letter and I had them a year +.

If you have cable your neighborhood has a a max amount of bandwidth allocated that it can use at any given time, a "pool" of bandwidth. Whether your neighborhood as a whole uses 100 GB in a month or 30 TB it's going to be the same to the ISP. What will cost them is upgrading the neighborhood so the "pool" can support 10 GB bandwidth at any given moment VS say 3 GB.

It's why ISPs label their speeds as UP TO xx/x , during peak times if a lot of people in your area are using their net a lot you will see yourself getting less than your promised 100/10 line can normally, but it's why you pay for more bandwidth in the first place, or at least part of why.

Note: this is basic and doesn't get into node backhauls and etc.

So in short, data caps from cable companies are complete and utter bullshit. Bandwidth caps are not, if anyone tells you otherwise laugh at them and feel sorry for the world as they help ISPs rape us.

<DATE> 2016-12-07 04:06:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I was wondering if I could find out why PC only gamers hate consoles so much.

As a PC (MMOs, RTS's, FPS's) and console (everything else) gamer I never understood. Now I know the common arguments like 

Consoles hold PCs back

Console communities are cancerous (from my experience PC is just as bad, but don't get me wrong they both are really bad with some exceptions)

But some PC gamers hate consoles with such a ferocity it makes me think their PS2 did bad things to them as kids (a joke, no one get too upset).

I hope the discussion (if anyone bothers to reply) can stay civil, I just really want to understand why some people in the "PCmasterrace" (not just this sub but a vocal part of the community as a whole) hate it so much. And I do know not every PC gamer hates consoles so much, or at all.

I guess to add from a console(and on a smaller scale PC gamer) side why I like consoles:
Cheaper, I got my semi recent PS4 for 200$ used, had it for a year now 0 problems (I also own an X1). I put together my current PC 4690k, 8 gb ram, GTX 1060 (upgraded from my GTX 770 I got new back when it was new tech) and I don't see how one, even buying used since I bought my PS4 used, can put together a PC to meet PS4 graphics for 200$.

To expand even if someone new was getting into gaming a PS4 slim is 300$ new, most people already have a TV, so besides games you're good to go. For PC it would be very hard to buy new and get PS4 graphics for 300$ when including MOBO, RAM, case, cpu, GPU, HDD etc. They could technically use their TV as a monitor but very few PC gamers would recommend that.

Console has no driver issues, it's UPNP pretty much. On my PC I have to do DDU every so often and will still get a game with weird issues that I, or Google, can't fix.

<TEXT> This is the conclusion I've come to, more or less. In the US we have demonized sex for so long that we can view blowing people up, ripping them limb from limb, etc as more acceptable than skin/sex (whether pixels or real). A parent will buy their kid GTA 5 KNOWING how violent it is, but when they find out it has sex in it they'll be at the store pissed off demanding a refund. Their kid going on gore and blood filled murderous rampages is more acceptable than animated nudity and sex.

I mean I owned GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas when I was a teen and I don't think it's bad if a teen owns and plays these games, that's up to the parents judgement on how well their kids can handle the exposure, at least before a certain age. But seriously, it just seems so odd to me when the violence is A okay but nudity or sex is the devil, so to speak. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be honest though, parents SHOULD be having this talk with their kids (several times) IMHO at least.

My mom, for example, probably had 5 talks with my siblings and me between the ages of 13 to 16/17 becoming more "age appropriate" so to speak the older we got. She drilled using condoms, being safe, not getting STIs (STDs), etc in to us while also letting us know sex isn't some horrible thing that can or will ruin our lives or make us go to hell. That it should be with someone we love, but we most likely will have it with people we don't but to be safe about it.

Sex discussions may be hard and awkward but I think their vital and needed. Of course I'm not inherently trying to be holier en though and every parent has different methods, views, and priorities. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should have called your local store, I called 611 to just find out the deals (the website and PDFs confused me) and called my local store to make sure they had the Stylo 2 in (which they did, and the employee said they have a bunch). Of course mileage may vary on stock.

By the way have you had a Stylo before? I loved my Stylo 1 (16 GB model) and am just as happy with my 2. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's 10$ from what I was told, but only 4$ will go towards the Stylo so I get ~6 off my normal bill. Downside is I can't pay the Stylo off early, from what I was told, or I lose the bill credit. I was thinking of paying the last 110'ish off and pocketing the 24 months of 10$ off haha. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just want to start with: I've only been a customer since August.

So Tuesday night I call 611 to find out more info on the Black Friday deals, I find out I can get an LG STYLO 2 for 32$ down and then get 24 months of bill credits of 10$, giving me the price of the Stylo paid off. I double and triple check it'll only be 32$ down, stupid me didn't think to have her notate it.

So I go into the T-Mobile store yesterday to get my Stylo, I had a Stylo one I loved but hard bricked after the 1 year warranty, find out it'll be 132$ down. I say F it and pay it down, pay the 20$ in store fee. I get home and call 611 and ask to be forwarded straight to customer loyalty and crossed my fingers.

Lady was real nice, straight up told me what I already knew of: the longer you're with them the more they can do for you. She couldn't get me 100$ refunded, of which I was positive I was qouted (several times) and she agreed if I had the rep notate it it'd be a bit different. She did reverse the 20$ in store fee into a bill credit though. I was also curious about opening up the 3rd and then 4th free line. I got an uneeded sim kit with my Stylo and she sent me out a free sim kit for the 4th line. 

All in all, for me for being a customer for a bit over 2 months I feel like the loyalty department treated me pretty well (T Force really was no help here tbh as I did try them first). So +5 for Tmo from me. I wish I had saved that 100$ but that is (a bit) on me as I knew better and know to have a customer care rep notate every damn thing haha. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're basically lease to own a phone that you pay X a month for on top of your service bill, (or in the promos case TMo pays the X for you if you stay with them) if you leave early of course they'll want the rest of the money for the phone. I did a BYOD and I cancel anytime. You can also pay for the phone in full, or by a cheaper but used second hand TMo device to do a BYOD to not have to worry about the remaining MSRP balance.

But I mean it seemed pretty clear to me you can get a free phone but stay with TMo for 2 years (or cancel early and pay what you have left on the phone) or BYOD or pay in full. I don't really see how any of this could make someone mad, seem underhanded/lying, be called unfair, or etc etc etc. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Having issues with a game update. </TITLE>

<TEXT> So I bought Dying Light after watching my roommate play it on his PC, all excited for it I let the update download (just a bit over 18 GB) after installing the disk. That went well until it hit 100%, now it's at almost 20 GB downloaded and seems to be a never ending download. 

For the most part if I just let it go the total download just raises everytime .01 GB is downloaded and always shows 100%. I tried power cycling my console 2x, first time I turned my modem off and it showed the download progress at 104% 19 (aprox) GB/18 (aprox) GB when turning on my modem and the Xbox connecting to the Internet/live it changed to 100% and the total needed to download just went up everytime .01 GB was downloaded again. 

The second power cycle I left the modem on and right out the gate started at 100% (not over 100% like when starting up offline). I've looked online and couldn't seem to find anyone else having this issues,  much less a fix and was hoping for some possible help here. I'd really like to not have to uninstall/reinstall as the first time the 18 GB was painfully slow (I have the best net I can in my area and 18 GB takes the better part of a full day best case scenario).

I've tried power cycling

Stopping and starting the update

Just letting it run (seems to just go up indefinitely )

Edit: spelling </TEXT>

<TEXT> I came to the reddit to see if there was any posts on the login problems and had to make an account  (I pretty much just lurk) to express my surprise. Maybe my local store is just really great but I've had only good experiences there. Switched to Tmo in mid August, a bit before the One plan rolled out, and the sales guy (who I assume was the manager) was listening to me talk about I had always had prepaid and this was my first time going post paid.

He basically hooked me up by waving my deposit on my phone (80$ I think it would have been), waived the activation fee, and took 10$ off my bill (was getting the unlimited simple choice plan).

Went in to switch to the One Plus plan (no internet where I live except Sat so the unlimited tethering is enticing ) and  same guy gave me 10$ off that too since I told him I wouldn't do autopay so it sucked I couldn't get the discount. 

Now on the other hand this is the 3rd friggin time since I've had Tmo that there has been some major problems. Haven't been able to login to the website since like 8 PM yesterday and I know many others have been experiencing similar. </TEXT>
