<TEXT> I definitely think there can be good one word titles, it just depends on what connotations the word has and what it evokes for the reader. I like the title 'Yellow' by Janni Visman, I find any title that has a colour in it evokes interest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that's a good point, as well. The title is very much a part of the writer's vision. Often when I write, I try to make any titles inspiring to readers, since that's part of the technique I learnt when studying creative writing. I like to evoke the feel of the story, whilst trying to make it a bit intriguing for the reader.

I've definitely bought books based on cover art. In fact, the book I mentioned in my original post, 'Evening is the Whole Day', has one edition with a beautiful illustration of a flower on the cover, which was what made me choose it. The other edition's cover I didn't find particularly inspiring, so I might not even have picked it up. I am a bit fickle when it comes to book covers... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you think the admin was serious? 

On a side note, the real question the admin's comments raised to me is to what extent should STEM students give up their personal needs for the sake of scientific progress? In that admin's train of thought, a majority of people should be forced into STEM subjects and spend as much time as possible at their work for the sake of progress. In my view, people should be able to do what they want, rather than have to sacrifice for the 'greater good', as long as they take care of their personal responsibilities. Got a bit off-topic there, lol... </TEXT>

<TITLE> The importance of book titles </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-07 14:49:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm currently reading Alice Munro's short story collection, 'Dear Life'. I've enjoyed quite a few of the stories in the collection, but I think some of their names are a bit lackluster. One or two word titles like, 'Gravel' and 'Haven'. It didn't really give me any kind of idea of what the story might be like or get me interested in some of the themes or events that might be involved. 

It got me thinking about the importance of titles for books and short stories. This might be something more important for short stories, because there's not always a lot of information about what each individual story is like on the back cover, so you only really have the titles on the contents page to go on.

A book title I absolutely love, and that made me want to pick the book out in the first place was, 'Evening is the Whole Day' by Preeta Samarasan. The contradictory statement and its implications of days filled with darkness was an image that really interested me from the outset. I believe it's actually a quote from a translation of a poem featured in Kuruntokai, a classical Tamil poetry anthology. This ties in with some of the book's themes of Indian migration to Malaysia, and is mentioned in the book. It's such an inspiring title.

How important do you think book and short story titles are? Have you ever bought a book based on the title? Do you have a favourite title? </TEXT>

<TEXT> ...Either because of the sound or their meaning, or another reason. Non-English words would obviously count also.

I love the sound of the words 'flotsam' and 'jetsam', and also 'ocean'. So, a lot of words related to the sea. 'Atmosphere' is also beautiful.

For its meaning, I love the word 'freedom'. I also love the word 'darou' or , a Japanese word roughly meaning 'probably'. I like the way the Japanese 'r' sound mixes into the lengthened 'oh' sound at the end.  </TEXT>

We have to write a Wikipedia-style article about conflict during the Industrial revolution, using specific sources. I took part in a similar activity earlier in the year which went well. I can be a bit of a control freak when it comes to coursework, so it was definitely a learning curve! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wanted to go into video game translation at the time, so I thought it might be good if I had some coding experience. But C++ looked too intimidating for me, so I tried learning HTML to start. I enjoyed what I learned, but ended up going on to other things. I think I'm less good on the technical front, I tend to be better at creative things. 

I've been trying to write a short story collection. It's very difficult without having a total understanding of how writing works, but I'm muddling through it. I'd recommend creative writing courses, but I think it can be done without them. There's a lot of helpful information I've read online, and reading books of course helps. I analyse pretty much everything from a writer's perspective, films, video games, works of art, real life conversations. It gets to the point where it's hard to switch off. XD

Wow, that's quite a lot to get through! My course is part time till next year, so I have a much lighter workload for now. I have some work on analysing sources to complete, but there's a couple of weeks left till my next assignment, which is a group project.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 3D modelling and A.I both sound really interesting, but my nearest experience of coding is a bit of HTML I did years ago. I completely agree. I think university is more about the core skills it gives you, rather then just the qualification. University is great because it pushes you to create coherent work by yourself within a deadline, and I've noticed myself improve drastically as person since I started.

Yes, that was my problem with writing. I'd write heaps of notes and ideas, but when it came to actually writing something, it came out as an incoherent mess and I'd get fed up with it. My course forces me to write shorter, planned pieces, so I can really focus on the techniques I'm using. I also got feedback from other students on my writing, which is invaluable.

What is it you're working (or procrastinating) on now? Good luck with the course! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly, I think IT is a very stable qualification, and it can be used to go into a variety of different fields. How far through it are you? I'm near the end of my second year (it's scary - I still feel like it's only just started!).

I've always wanted to be a writer, so when I saw the course, I knew I had to do it. I know it's not the most secure degree, but I suspect I'll go into something like communications anyway, and English is always useful for that. I've found the creative writing parts I've done so far absolutely brilliant, and I've been more confident in producing my own pieces of writing. If you're interested in writing, definitely keep it up, since it's a nice contrast to maths and IT. 

I enjoy them, although it can get frustrating not being able to do the subject I chose right away. I can understand why the course is structured that way, since it's really about learning essay writing and primary/secondary sources, etc. I think doing subjects out of my comfort zone (I would never have considered studying R.E and classical studies) has pushed me further than ever before, so in that sense it has been very rewarding. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I felt this way a lot when I first started my degree. I think you can't predict what will happen, but if you're doing well right now, I think that's a pretty good sign. There's also usually lots of things universities have in place to support you if you're finding something difficult. I don't really believe in 'failure', I think if something goes wrong there are always ways around it or other options, and to me nothing in life is wasted. 

It's maybe easy for me to say, but have faith in yourself. I think pretty much everyone feels like this sometime, and I'm sure that's not actually going to be the case. What degree is it you're doing? </TEXT>

I've only experienced it from a woman's perspective, and I am aware there are issues across the board with the mental health services (or at least in the UK). Some people just don't understand mental illness, even in the mental health services! With that being said, I do think it's harder for men to 'come out' about mental health, since they perhaps just keep going and don't discuss their issues. I have noticed a few men's support groups opening up here and there, so that's promising.

I myself am going through a bad patch with panic attacks, and they are difficult to deal with. Have you done any cognitive behavioural therapy, as the techniques there can be very helpful? My advice is to keep going out as much as you can, putting yourself into situations that set off your attacks, so you can see that nothing happens to you. I know how hard that is through first hand experience, but it's the only way it will get better. Panic attacks feel awful, but those feelings are essentially normal and can't actually hurt you. I really wish you good luck in dealing with your panic attacks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Perhaps listen to a classical radio station. Since I was a kid my mum always had a classical music station on, and that was how I got to know all the pieces, and find new ones I like. I find I'm still learning now who the different composers are/were and which pieces are by who. 

Perhaps also look into the specific genres or eras of classical music, and find the ones you like most. I personally enjoy piano and choral compositions the most, but there's plenty of other styles out there.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> All of these composers are relatively modern - composing in the last twenty five to thirty years or so. 

Ludovico Einaudi - I find his piano compositions the best. I Giorni was the piece of music that first got me hooked on classical music when I was 13. https://youtu.be/Uffjii1hXzU

Ryuuichi Sakamoto - Japanese film composer, very underrated 
https://youtu.be/LGs_vGt0MY8

Joe Hisaishi - Also a Japanese film composer, again very underrated, rarely hear him played on classical radio stations
https://youtu.be/J7or0noYfMA

Sir Karl Jenkins - Everything he composes is amazing, and he works in a variety of classical genres, some of his music is choral, some tribal, some instrumental. The Benedictus makes me tear up a bit. https://youtu.be/zc1Zoz-NUro

Morten Lauridsen - His choral composition, 'O Magnum Mysterium' got me interested in choral music. https://youtu.be/Q7ch7uottHU </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love how they got such a 70s feel to the concert, really fits with the music. Watching performances from this concert on YouTube was the first time I was truly amazed by a live show. The Strokes are absolutely timeless. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The ending themes for 1 and 2 are absolutely breathtaking. They actually inspire me for making music outside the video game soundtrack genre. They're so nostalgic and moving. Whenever I listen to them, it's like I've gone back to when I was 12 and playing the series for the first time. 

I remember, back before I twigged that YouTube existed, I used to replay to certain points in the game to hear my favourite pieces from the soundtrack. Just like the game itself, the music clings to you and never quite lets go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a newer fan, but I didn't like Comedown Machine at first because it's so different to their earlier style, but One Way Trigger, Happy Ending and Tap Out are some of my absolute favourite Strokes songs now.  I think it's about enjoying it as work in and of itself and not comparing to their older style. </TEXT>
