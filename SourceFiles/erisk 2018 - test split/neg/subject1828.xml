<TITLE> [Spoiler] Back to the Future Easter egg in Episode 8? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-30 07:34:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just before Eleven unleashes her full energy, the clock on the classroom wall reads [almost 10:04.](http://i.imgur.com/xRYXEQl.jpg) 

10:04 is the time when lightning struck the Hill Valley clock tower in Back to the Future.

Is Eleven putting out 1.21 Gigawatts??

If it's not an Easter egg, it's a continuity error, because Mr. Clarke says it's "10:00 on a Saturday" on the phone in Episode 7, hours before the scene in Episode 8. So I'm going with Easter egg.

And... November 12, the date of the BTTF lightning strike in 1955, was also a Saturday night in 1983. 

Stranger Things begins on November 6, 1983, meaning that the climactic Saturday night was November 12. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Posted on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stpband/posts/10153636913457906) this afternoon:

Dear Scott,

Let us start by saying thank you for sharing your life with us.

Together we crafted a legacy of music that has given so many people happiness and great memories.

The memories are many, and they run deep for us.

We know amidst the good and the bad you struggled, time and time again.

Its what made you who you were.

You were gifted beyond words, Scott.

Part of that gift was part of your curse.

With deep sorrow for you and your family, we are saddened to see you go.

All of our love and respect.

We will miss you brother,

Robert, Eric, Dean </TEXT>

<TEXT> The one time I tried Ryanair, I checked in early, was issued a boarding pass, went to the airport the next day, had the computer claim there was an error with said boarding pass, paid for a second pass ($37), and got to the gate for my delayed flight.

After the extra wait, they then refused to board me, claiming that my boarding pass, which they had issued me TWICE, was invalid because of a passport issue. Even though I entered all my passport information twice and was issued a pass without issue twice. Took me two months to get hold of a real person to complain, that person refused to take even partial responsibility and decided that it was proper for them to keep my money for a flight they never let me take.

I loved Ireland, I hated Ryanair. Never, ever again. </TEXT>

In fact, Oregon recognizes a marriage of love with the same equal eye that it recognizes a marriage of convenience. It affords the same set of rights and privileges to Tristan and Isolde that it affords to a Hollywood celebrity waking up in Las Vegas with a blurry memory
and a ringed finger. 

It does not, however, afford these very same rights to gay and lesbian couples who wish to marry within the confines of our geographic borders. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course, it's better AND worse.  Being unmarried my whole life and nearing 40, I've traversed dating in both eras.  As you allude to in your latest show, it's so much more common now for people to bail on a date or just go silent and ignore someone when most of your communication is done through texting.  I've seen it more and more as the years have passed.  In fact, it happened to me exactly one night before I traveled to Tulsa to see your show, and it stung a little less laughing as you walked through the exact scenario that had happened to me.

On the flip side of that, knowing how to talk to a girl on the phone is suddenly a huge advantage.  Most of the time.  Sometimes, girls in their 20s almost get creeped out when you call them, like it has somehow become crossing a line too quick.  But generally, it's so much better in coordinating dates and helps establish rapport before you ever meet up.

I'm not knocking texting, it has also saved me from anger and wrath when plans have changed at the last minute.  I remember one particular date before I had a cell phone when traffic and other delays had me so late, I was freaking out the whole time that my night and future chances with her were toast.  Luckily, they weren't.

I think being able to know that much more about someone before you ever meet them in the smartphone era is great, but part of me does miss just showing up at the door for the first date and the mystery of what you were about to experience.

<TEXT> The deeper we go into the final episodes, and the more brutal the stakes, the less graphic the on-screen violence has become.  It's all emotional gore now.

Declan and his crew?  Killed off-screen, audio only.
Gomez?  Death not seen.
Hank?  Cut-away just as the fatal shot is fired.  Even the shot to his leg isn't shown.
Jesse's latest brutal beating?  We only see the aftermath.

The most graphic bloodletting we see is Skyler cutting Walt with the butcher knife.  Because it's the most personal and emotional.

Plus, the resolution of the show was hey, even though we believe different things, we can all come together to beat the crap out of bully douchebags, including Anthony Michael Hall.

This show is consistently solid. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm all for dumb fun, and good mindless disaster popcorn.  But if it's an actual produced movie and not a YouTube video of stuff falling over or exploding, I'd like some semblence of a cohesive plot and maybe some acting for my 10 bucks.  

You know all that hype about the Mayans and the prophecy and 12-21-12?  They focus on that heavily for about an hour... then throw it out completely.  Turns out the world doesn't end then, it's really like late summer or something, whenever the Olympics are taking place.  The Mayans aren't even mentioned the last 90 minutes of the movie, the whole premise of the movie that they put on the posters and all the promotional materials is completely abandoned for shitty acting, reaction shots, and of course, saving a puppy.

All foreign characters are cheap ethnic stereoypes.  The whole thing drips of American arrogance throughout.  I was ashamed watching it.  Makes Michael Bay look subtle and skilled in comparison. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Setting the single-payer part aside, Kucinich's primary point is simple and the closest thing to an absolute truth in this debate:

Until you reform the insurance industry, you have no real health care reform.

This bill simply feeds the problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And don't forget the circumstances of the crash, which have been recollected in the media in light of the distracted Northwest pilots last week.  The pilots in the '74 crash were arguing over Nixon's pardon.  Colbert lost a father and two brothers, in part, because of a political argument.  And now he makes his living nightly satirizing that very culture of political combativeness.  Just... wow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cool idea, but the mechinism may be flawed.  As a single with no dependents, it says I would receive a tax cut up to $100,000 in income, then I wouldn't for $125,000 or $150,000, but I would at $175,000 or $200,000.  Huh? </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is actually a government program that Experian takes part in that really does give you your credit report (although not your score) for free.

They will try to sell you extra services and subscriptions, but the report itself is free, you can get one a year from each of the three major credit bureaus.

<TEXT> The bit that summed up the script best for me was when Indy realizes that the aliens are archaeologists... JUST LIKE HIM.  

Mind you, they are archaeologists who painstakingly assemble a massive collection of artifacts from throughout the globe and then position them perfectly... so that every last one of them is destroyed when their ship takes off.

Awful, awful script. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As the original poster of the Guinness ad, here's what I know:  Nothing.  It was there at #7 when I went home from work about 5:30 CST, my friend told me it was up to #2 a few hours later when it disappered.  I have retained my karma points from the post, but there is no record of it existing in my account and no message from reddit.  Your guess is as good as mine. </TEXT>
