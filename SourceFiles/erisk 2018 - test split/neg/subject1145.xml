<TEXT> They tried. For years people tried. They taunted Undertaker in hotels, bars, restaurants, on tours over seas. The plane ride from Hell always leaves out the fact that the Undertaker was in the corner being screamed at by Booker T (who lost his voice); Kane would call the Undertaker up and try to get him to come to televisions tapings and do it; Vince would visit the Undertaker in his time off and they'd watch MTV, Bring It On, You Got Served and at a low point they even marathoned Julia Stiles movies; Triple H even threatened to take away Taker's Wrestlemania match, but that didn't go through. Over all this fighting, The Undertaker never gave in. The Undertaker never did the spinaroonie. And the world is a sadder place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd always recommend seeking a permit. One of the best ways is to check on line. A permit helps protect you if authorities tell you to move.   

Another way to find out how to get a permit is to just start playing then wait for the cops to show up (be compliant if they ask you to move) then ask them how to get a permit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Two months ago I was waiting for the trolley. This gal with a swaztika came up and tried to guilt me in to giving her a cigarette. She was saying how the AB wasn't treating her right. How she was dying because she couldn't keep anything down except for chicken broth. While I had sympathy for another human being in pain; I had none for the decisions she made to bring her there. She was very distraught because she gave one of them a blowjob and he didn't give her a place to stay. Just sharing an anecdote as to how neo-nazis treat their own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was just going to scroll past this; but upon further contemplation I must pontificate about the mental state of Disney characters. When is a Disney character not a lunatic?  

Cinderella thought she could talk to mice. The prince was so in love with a woman he danced with once; he used a shoe to find her and called it a slipper.  

Ariel is not satisfied with being the princess of 70% of the Earth. She deals with sea witches when she could have easily told Eric, "Hey I'm a mermaid, let's fuck and marry." Or something of the sort.  

Belle is into Beast-iality, gas lighting and Stockholm stuff.  

None of the lions at Pride Rock are impressed that Scar made a damn army of hyenas to do his bidding.  

There's so much more =/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> A couple of notes. I'd save the gorilla position until the end (the gorilla position to entrance cut is always a nice touch, cliche'd but almost expected). I'd shorten the intro to no longer than two minutes. I'd put a bit more stories in the intro, example: some heartbreak, injury, mega wins. I'd put some of the fans waiting outside in the rain, if there's footage (fans are the most important part of indies). Also, I'd get rid of the guy reading, I don't care what he's reading, I don't care if its his gimmick, I don't care if he's just really happy about pages, people reading on film (especially a documentary) is absolutely boring. Hope to see the doc soon and remember to save money for marketing and festival entries! </TEXT>

Three words,  
To lay upon Thine feet,  
And lick them off (if that interests Thee),  
Three words,  
To show I be not freak,  
Three words:  
I'm not creep.

<TEXT> I have an IG whre I post a lot of vegetarian friendly dishes.  

One of my favorites is Vegetarian Enchiladas (easily veagan). You just blend up butternut squash and use that for the filling instead of meat!  

Pan fried brussel sprout (coated in olive oil, salt and pepper) tacos is pretty good too! Add some black beans and salsa!  

End of the Week Scramble is my favorite! You take all the greens and veggies that are about to go bad and make them into a scramble (I use eggs but replacements are easy). This can even be used to make breakfast burritos for the week! </TEXT>

<TEXT> He knows it's not going to win him the match; but it's definitely putting a hurt on the back and the back of the head. Holding the opponent down for more than a second is enough to break even the greatest man's psyche. Zayn gets under his opponent's skin with the move. If he can get a 2 count, then he's only moments away from getting a three count, Zayn knows it and his opponent now knows it. The fist pumping is from the surge of adrenaline Zayn gets from knowin the end is near. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the biggest problems in WWE today. The moves are predictable. There was a surreal amount of surprise in Bret Hart's matches. You never knew when the finish would come. When ECW was a thing (not THAT thing the thing before it), you never knew what crazy shit they were going to do next.  

Now a finisher is really just a normal move. The winner of the match has to do his comeback, three finisher reversals, his signature, another three reversals then the finisher; repeat this sequence twice, then end the match.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What r/squaredcircle has to remember is to not work themselves into a shoot! There's tons of wrestlers out there and there's going to be so many that are good heels! Stop circle jerking and getting your panties in a bunch and love to hate the guys instead of hating on them and casting out what they did as untalented! These guys are the most talented heels of all time if they can get r/squaredcircle to get their hands off each other's dicks and finally learn to be wrestling fans again. For reals! What's the fucking point of even watching professional wrestling if you're going to shit all over it? You want to watch a couple a wrestlers swimming around in your shit? Is that it? Is that what you want r/sc? Why not just watch the fucking product, buy some fucking t-shirts and be happy that you can take your children to a fucking show and make some fucking memories for them. If r/sc was my kid I'd leave them at the arena and book it to my car; let John Cena take care of it. There's nothing better than sharing good memories for your kid. Nothing! And here are these grown ass people never getting enough of a product they hate. I don't go to the ice cream store and get bubblegum ice cream because I don't like it; I get a flavor I like! I don't go to the beach because I hate being in the water! Why the fuck do you watch wrestling if you hate it so much??? WHY!? I'm going to go watch Anastasia. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are a few options to make a chunkier salsa; though you're going to suffer from a change of taste, in this case, it's for the better.  

**Option Numero Uno:** Buy your **tomatoes from the Farmer's Market**, as u/BakoMan said, store bought tomatoes have less liquid than delicious Farmer's Market tomatoes, so you'll be able to use less tomatoes. **The Plus:** Your salsa will taste even fresher than before. **The Minus:** You will be limited to tomato season. **My Take:** In the past few months I've used both to make salsa (to go with my homemade tortillas); *heriloom* turns out to be the best as far as taste and chunk; *store bought* made the salsa runny and more like that shitty grocery store salsa that comes in a plastic container.  

 **Option Numero Dose:** If you have a **gas stove then roast your peppers** this will change the flavor of the salsa (for the better). This will allow you to **omit the vinegar.** Because your salsa will have a bolder flavor from the roasted peppers.  

**Option C:** You can either **Don't break the salsa down as much OR** as u/flyinggeorge suggested, **strain the liquid.**  

Well now you've got some options! Oh! Here's my recipe for salsa:  

1 basket of small Farmer's Market bought heirloom tomatoes. One Farmer's Market bought lime. 2 Serrano peppers roasted on an open flame. 1 whole grain of sea salt (optional). Salt (seasoned to taste). Toss the food (not the lime juice) into a food processor of blender. While mixing to desired coarseness, add lime juice. Salt to taste.  

Edit: Misquoted u/BakoMan </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think they were burned during the time it was cool to burn Vonnegut books. I personally like the later books after the burning. So finding original manuscripts is your only option. These go for millions of dollars , thugh, so I'll give you a plot summary of each (DO NOT READ BELOW UNLESS YOU WANT SPOILERS):  

Slaughterhouse 1: The OP novel of Kurt. This one didn't get enough love, as it was a prequel that came out before the main book did. (Scholars often think that Kurt should have released this after V.) Kelvin, the main character, starts up the slaughterhouse. It's all about the trials and tribulations of one man trying to make a small living. Really good read if you want a one man taking on normal odds. There's a small section about a baker using grey mold to make everyone go crazy. Kelvin overcame the sickness of the grey mold; the landlord trying to get his wife and even managed to pay his taxes.  

Slaughterhouse 2: Here is where the fun begins. Kelvin's wife (unnamed) gives birth to a son, Bronschwiegg (Bronzi). Why the German name? For two purposes: First, ther Germans are closing in on thw town and Kelvin wants his son to sound like a German in order to fit in. Second, there is a visit from the Orondorffersons, an alien society comparable to the Illuminati of Earth. They inform, Kelvin that Bronzi is going to father one of the most important children of the 20th century. This novel is accredited to Kurt's first use of tropes with the phrase, "Stay in the water." being used exactly 256 times. The irony (and if you can find the manuscript online I highly suggest you give it a read); there is no mention of water in the book.  

Slaughterhouse 3: Considered, among scholars, to be the second best of the Slaughterhouse series, this is one action packed book. From the Old West style shoot out between, a now fully grown Bronzi, and his nemesis in the book, Ketlz Von Bastion; to the Lord of the Rings style battle between Bronzi's Jewish/Alien army and the Nazis; to the fact that the book is one of Kurt's longest novels at (500 written pages) coupled with the fact that he incorporates a numerology reference on each page. It's safe to say that this is my favorite (and many other's favorite) of the Slaughterhouse series. This is also where the term "Slaughterhouse" used in the slang term of massacre, bloodbath, etc, was coined. When you search for this one online be careful of the CreepyPasta of the same name (that one is about a Slender Man arcade cabinet that ate children or something; I actually finished the CreepyPasta then only upon research did I find out that I read the wrong book lol!).  I consider this Kurt's masterpiece; but I love written action, the thrill of trying to figure out exactly what an author is trying to describe adds to the excitement of the moment! Kurt's dry style really leads to great action! (For example, "He swung. I jumped. He swung again. I killed him. Farewell Dear Friend. Another attacked. I killed him. Farewell Dear Friend. My shirt had bits of stardust on it. Glaxxor ((Bronzi's best alien buddy)) was dead. Farewell Dear Friend). Needless to say "Farewell Dear Friend," became a part of human speech quickly. In the book the phrase means goodbye in so many ways. I'm in tears writing this because of "how deep it goes," another trope from the book. You have to just read it. For reals, you owe it to yourself to find the manuscript!!!  

Slaughterhouse IV: This is the first one that started using tRoman Numerals in the title. Bronzi dies. I'm just going to get that out of the way right now. He was able to make it to America (at the end of the third book) and father a son, Billy Pilgrim. This book is all about Billy growing up; he blacks out from time to time. Then Billy sees his future and alternate timelines of his adult life. There are so many alternate timelines that at the time it was released, people thought that Kurt was messing with them by not giving them a definitive book. The catch was actually far smarter than anyone at the time realized. In true Kurt fashion, his fondness of numerology surfaced once again. Instead of reading the book one word at a time you would have to read every fifth word of the book; or every third word of the book, depending on who's story you're following. So you pick a Pilgrim from the sixth chapter then skip to the corresponding word depending which Pilgrim you picked. Eventually everything was straightened out in a second edition of the book. The stories are pretty exciting. In one Billy Pilgrim joins his friends the Tralformadores, and fights in a space battle alongside them, but the Tralformadore's memory has to be wiped clean of Billy in order for them to continue existing as a species, the sad thing is they respected Billy immensely but knew they'd put him in a zoo if they ever crossed paths again. Iirc correctly the third Billy went out West and fought Jesse James for while until running into a big nugget of gold and retiring with his favorite prostitute. Fourth Billy was my favorite; he ended up as a kind of old-fashioned super-hero (Like Batman in a way) he used Leonardo da Vinci's flying machine to soar around New York, swooped down on enemies and strangle them with a noose. Fifth Billy is where a lot of the people thought the book would go; he became a butcher with a dark secret; he would butcher PEOPLE in the back of the butcher shop, but only criminals and murderers; a lot of people really liked this (and I think it's obvious where this plot popped up again). Sixth Billy was killed with only saying his catchphrase once, "I lived." Which brings up a great point! each Billy had their own catchphrase! I can't remember them for the life of me, but they weren't that memorable.  

Which brings us up to speed to Slaughterhouse V. I think you'll find out which Billy they decided to go with. Hope the summaries helped friend! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just went to my local fed; the champion match seemed like they were calling it about three to five moves at a time, even the dives. The more established stars (Rey Mysterio, Cholo, RPG Vince and So Cal Crazy) seemed to have some sequences planned but there was a lot of body language involved; Mysterio took about four clotheslines in the corner when his opponent was making it clear he wanted him to move lol! </TEXT>

<TITLE> (Rant)Guy talking loudly on phone in library </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-14 01:25:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This guy was talking loudly on the phone in the library, the phone was loud enough to hear the person on the other end. He proceeds to walk to my are and behind me. I calmly asked him (in my library voice) to take his conversation elsewhere. Then I stare at him for a while, hoping he gets the point. "You staring at me isn't going to make me leave any faster," he says. I turn around and compose myself for a moment. He continues talking. I turn around and stare at him again. He doesn't get the point. It took me digging through my bag (my intention was to cut off his shitty ponytail, or tie, but let's be honest it's going to get bloody at that point and I probably would have killed him in my rage) to get him to finally leave.   

Had to calm myself down after that, listened to music box music lol! The good thing is that I was able to recognize that I was being triggered and kept it together until the asshole left. It's things like this, though, that really make me upset, not just about my life, but about people with BP in general. Why are people such assholes sometimes? Do they know that at any minute they could be on the receiving end of something terrible? Eh, I'm just rambling now, rant over lol! </TEXT>

The filling goes more towards one side than the other. There is far less filling in a smaller tortilla (6-8in.) compared to the restaurant sized tortillas (10-14in.) Fold the top and bottom over the filling; fold the side closest to the filling over and under the filling; then roll!

<TEXT> Here are some ideas for the "No Rematch" clause:  

- The Power 25 system, in which the loser drops down to the bottom of the stack and has to work their way back up.  

-  DQ results in a suspension of competition and forfeit of the title to competitor.  

- A purposeful Count Out (c) results in (and I'm reaching here) a 24 Hour open title hunt, in which any Superstar can challenge for the title 24 hours after the count out is declared.  

- DQ by interference results in the injured party winning the match and gaining or retaining the title.  

What do you think? </TEXT>

You can also take the plan every spot approach. That might be overwhelming to some people, though. Maybe plan a few big spots and call some of the action inbetween.   </TEXT>

I feel that in every way, the shame/disrespect/agony a woman feels by not showing her breasts is in every way an example of the specific women's body shaming that has gone on for way too long. A woman shouldn't have to show anyone her breasts; likewise they shouldn't be treated as dangerous sexual objects. Simply the things which men have that are more capable of feeding babies. </TEXT>

Third: She's on something. Meth doesn't have a smell like weed (I know, I worked in a place where a lot of customers smoked meth) it's more of a feeling than a smell.  

Fourth: You have every right to kick somebody out of your house if you don't want them there. Although I think you handled it well, seeing as there were repercussions anyways, they could have escalated into a broken window quite fast. Maybe turn the hose on her next time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only thing wrong, and I'm nitpicking but I see it all too often now, is the face Goldberg had when he gave the championship to the ring crew. This small detail let me know that it was over for him. For my taste, I'd say a champion should convey being proud, being afraid, being happy or not giving a fuck. To be sad is not an acceptable emotion before a title match (with exception to story). Other than that this was expertly booked! </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's three basic punches I believe. The open hand punch, the forearm punch and the punch hand punch.  

Open Hand- The striker will hit their opponent with an open fist.  

Forearm: This is what we see a lot nowadays. The forearm was used to simulate a cross or hook punch.  

Punch Hand Punch: The striker puts their hands on their opponent and strikes the hand. I've usually seen this used by wrestlers to gain control of a match.  

Here's a few links:

<TEXT> Ouch! But so true =(   I just don't get why they think anime (regardless of its origins) would make a decent live action movie.  

I like the concept of Dragon Ball Z, but don't want to see shitty (or even decent) special effects of purple haired Michael Cera with a sword. Then the next thing would be to change the aesthetics (like say Goku goes Super Sayan but his hair doesn't get big, it just gets blonde) but that would have hardcore fans screaming outrage.  

Has there been any good anime to live action movies? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love big idea movies! InTime, where time replaces money; The Purge, where crime is legal for one day. These movies gained most of their views through casting and unique premises. Always on the look out for more movies, I'm asking r/movies which movies they think have good premises but poor execution.  

A counter-example of goof premise and good execution would be something like Tucker and Dale vs. Evil; Cabin in the Woods; The Time Traveler's Wife. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The highlight promo of Raw is Reigns coming out to a chorus of boos. He states that this is his yard now. Then his opponent for the next pay per view comes out. It's none other than AJ Styles.  

Payback: Roman gives AJ one heck of a beating, getting in the Superman Punch before a Phenomenal Forearm. Roman gets the pin 1,2,3. AJ Styles holds out his hand for Reigns to shake. Roman takes a bit, but shakes it nonetheless.  

The next ppv, Extreme Rules, is going to be KO against The Big Dog. The build up is KO trying to end Reigns career with weapons. There's a stipulation added, if KO wins he gets a rematch for the Universal Title from Lesnar (who hasn't been seen for some time). The United States Championship is on the line.    

Extreme Rules: KO beats the crap out of Reigns. Everything Reigns throws at KO is blocked and returned with chairshots, kendo sticks and stairs. Reigns goes out on his back, injured and broken.  

 Reigns stays off the air for a few months. During this time Roman does a shitload of charity work, goes to a concert and headbangs to some internet smarky music (Reigns likes Hairbands!? Me too), he does an expose all interview with Oprah that really shows him as human and likable. SummerSlam comes right around the corner.  

SummerSlam: Braun Strowman is put up against Sheamus. Roman's music hits; HE'S BACK!!! Reigns SP both men, then he asks the crowd which one they want by holding his thumb sideways, whichever man gets the thumbs down gets it!  Reigns uses his new finisher, a tiger bomb! Reigns tiger bombs the first man, then he shrugs and tiger bombs the other one too.  

Reigns gets a mouthpiece when he's back. For the most part he stands there, looks intimidating and lets his manager talk. He chimes in with minimal words and catchphrases here and there.  

Night of Champions: Roman gets in a match with Braun and Sheamus. He doesn't decimate them. controls the match's pace. Neither man can get over Reigns...then Roman wins with another new maneuver: Walls of Jericho STF. The announcers say that Roman calls it, "The Column Collapser" or soemthing like that. The tiger bomb can be called The Empire's End, or something lol. Reigns puts Braun in the submission and forces him to tap out.  

Something happens to Braun during the match. He's not as sure of himself. He's actually scared to be in the same ring with Reigns. Every time they try to get a rematch going, Braun rolls out for the count out. Reigns wants to fight, but Braun isn't having it. This leads to a Hell in the Cell match.  

Hell in a Cell: It's Braun against Roman in Hell in a Cell grudge match! Braun tries to escape. Roman tosses him back in the ring. Braun gets the upper hand; eventually escapes the Cell then climbs to the top. Roman follows, he tries to tiger bomb Braun, but Braun reverses it, sending Roman through the top of the cage through the ring below. Braun climbs down from the cell. Roman climbs out of the hole, tries to get in some offense, but Braun gives Reigns the finisher. 1,2, Reigns kicks out! A few manuevers later and Braun is back in the Column Collapser! Braun taps out again! Roman wins his feud with the strongman.  

For Survior Series, Roman is captain of the team: Reigns and The New Day. Reigns and Day win leading to some fun celebrations, letting Reigns show a bit of humor.

Reigns' mouthpiece speaks up, now that they're done with Braun there's one more person that Roman needs to settle the score with...Brock Lesnar. There's one problem though, Seth Rollins wants the main event at Mania.  Samoa Joe speaks up and he too would enjoy the main event at Wrestlmania. This leads to a match for chance to face Lesnar at the Rumble.

Roadblock: Reigns is put in a triple threat match against Samoa Joe and Seth Rollins, though Reigns gets in some good offense, Samoa Joe proves to be the better fighter, which gives him the chance to compete for the title at Royal Rumble (Joe vs Lesnar).  

After Roadblock, Heyman and Lesnar return to TV. Joe and Lesnar work a program, meanwhile Reigns and his mouthpiece focus on training for the Rumble. Reigns is on TV, but in vignettes. He's seen punching bags, lifting weights, running and other workout things. During the segments (which can be funny or informative) Reigns instructs the viewers on how to work out, proper form, reps, etc. (trying to cover r/fitness lol); he gives slight nods to internet fans here and there and generally comes across as trying to help. One week on Raw he finds that he's pulled Number 1 for the Rumble.  

Royal Rumble: During the Royal Rumble, Reigns doesn't lay in a corner, he delivers Superman Punches and spears, and at one point it's just him in the ring waiting for the next entrant. He even tiger bombs some people over the top rope. It gets down to Braun Strowman, Randy Orton,KO and Reigns. Strowman gets scared out of the ring, Orton gets tossed by KO. Reigns and KO exchange strong style type forearms in the center of the ring. KO goes for the pop-up, but Reigns Superman Punches him. Reigns wins the Royal Rumble, hopefully with the crowd behind him at this point. Lesnar retains the title.  

At Fastlane, Reigns decimates his opponent in record time. Maybe a tag team member. This is crucial for Mania.  

With WM around the corner, Reigns' moutpiece and Heyman have all the material they need. "My client, Brock Lesnar was the first to beat the streak of the Undertaker." "My client, Roman Reigns, beat the Undertaker so bad he had to retire." and so forth. In an act of bravado, Reigns burns The Undertaker's clothes.  

Wrestlemania: Roman gets a hell of an entrance. Brock comes out with the championship. The match is more like an MMA match, with Roman and Lesnar both trying to get their submissions on each other. The finish is Roman rolling out of a German into the Column Crusher. Lesnar taps out, making Roman Reigns champ.

<TEXT> I'm pretty happy (and very sad) to see Reigns become a legend by ending Undertaker's career. Reigns is a future legend himself, if given the opportunity I'm sure most aspiring wrestlers would love to be where Reigns is at company wise.  

Lesnar and Goldberg had a fun match! Can't wait for the Lesnar/Reigns rematch!  

Wyatt and Orton started out great...then the projections didn't lead anywhere. Randy is a terrible worker and doesn't deserve a title. I just don't get why he gets pushed so hard. I've never seen him deliver in any match, big or small. He mostly sells, his psychology is wait wait wait, RKO. I just don't get his appeal.  

Rollins and Hunter was a classic! Not the motn but one that will be remembered fondly! I think I wasn't as hyped for this one because of the poor build up, to me it just seemed a bit forced. I didn't like Hunter's old man cart entrance.  

Raw Women was going well until Nia Jax was eliminated, then it wasn't that good. Now should be champ imho, Bayley has merch but I find her a bit lackluster.  

SDL Women's was pretty fun! Always love a Naomi entrance, and that ending was pretty good!  

Hardys reverse retirement match might be the greatest WM pop of all time! Wish there was a way for them to be kept secret, imagine if there was no buzz!  

KO vs Jericho was a solid workhorse match. Would have been better if the Universal title was on the line.  

AJ and Shane had one of the best matches I've seen! I was talking shit about Shane's punches then he elbowed AJ and I shut up. That 450 into the sub was fantastic!  

Ambrose and Corbin man, I'm trying to remember anything but the end, can't. That end was great though!  

ARMBAR- eh, okay. Fuck Shaq for not showing up, I was hyped for the battle of the giants! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The easiest answer to fix any taste is to own fry it in butter and brown sugar. For a healthier option there are flavored vinegars you might try to sweeten the taste.  

For that charred taste which another co!ment mentioned, I'd coat the veggies in olive oil, season, then drop them in an deeply oiled pan in order to get the right amount of chat on it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To address this first we must see and accept that not all pizza is alike. There are at least four different varieties within walking distance of me as I write this. The two big styles are New York and Chicago. New York (as I have been lead to believe) focuses on larger slices with a varying style of sauce. Chicago Style or Deep Dish has many layers to its chasm crust. But one can not simply say there are only two types of pizza, for in New York there are many styles of pizza that do not fall under the New York design. In Chicago there are Pizza Huts and other non-deep dish establishments. Which brings it to another style: American Take Out Style Pizza. This includes (but is not limited to) Papa John's, Pizza Hut, Domino's, Little Ceaser's and several various chained and non-chained stores, most offering delivery. In American Style Take Out Pizza there are varying styles of Deep Dish, New York, and of course, thin crust. Thin Crust pizza can be excluded from this debate of sandwiches and pies since, with its crunch, could hardly be considered either and more resembles a chip. I will, however, include Frozen Service Pizza, as its malleable crust (dependent on how the cooled treat is heated) can add a small puncture to one side of the argument of sandwich and pies. There is also the dread-devil franchise known as Cici's which offers something that resembles pizza for mass consumption from renegade feasters, alas, this is not pizza, but heaps of nightmare inducing, pizza flavored rubbish.
We must take a second to look at the definitions of: sandwich, pie, pizza and pragmatic (because I don't know what this word means. The amazing wizards of the world web have brought me an astute declaration of what defines a pizza: "a dish of Italian origin consisting of a flat, round base of dough baked with a topping of tomato sauce and cheese, typically with added meat or vegetables." I will tell you as my father told me on his death bed, "Remember the tomatoes." Unlike me, you will get closure; thusly like me, you will feel relieved to not be in the presence of such arrogance when the time you've been praying for finally comes. A pie is considered to be, "a baked dish of fruit, or meat and vegetables, typically with a top and base of pastry." Well, well well, what do we have here? An amazing discovery! It's almost as if I'm 9 years again and have just discovered you can do more than scratch your crotch! Meat! Meat can be used in pies; though this may not be quite a discovery to some, I've sailed through the aisles of grocers and wondered why someone would label a filled meat discus as "Pot Pie" when surely they did not come in a pot! Nor can I relinquish the thought that a grilled bread with cheese sandwich is commonly referred to as "Grilled Cheese" HA! More like a melt cheese sandwich! What is a sandwich? "An item of food consisting of two pieces of bread with meat, cheese, or other filling between them, eaten as a light meal." The plot thickens as we see that the same fillings for sandwiches are also used in both pizzas AND pies! Unfathomable! Yet, there it is, nano details in a sea of google.
And so u/gregbard as you sing your final tune of infuriating joy, you are wondering, no doubt, as to whether pizza is a sandwich or pie. Let us take a look at Deep Dish first: Pastry top, yes, meat and vegetables, yes, now if you stretch the truth (as I know you bards love to do) then you can see the similarities between Deep Dish and pie; for they are both deep and full of meat; as I would often find my ex lover; though I suppose such is the life when you love a sausage enthusiast. Now let us turn our attention towards the less pragmatic view. A sandwich must be between two pieces of bread; there you have it, pizza can never be a sandwich unless it is bread pizza which makes the argument pro sandwich invalid because bread pizza is bread with pizza; or pizza with bread, HA! Can you imagine putting small bits of bread on to a pizza!? To make pizza in to a sandwich you must put bread on both sides of it. Hardly an appetizing meal, though I have not partaken in the herbs, so this may prove to be tasteful in an altered state of mind. The argument that you may fold the pizza, as most New Yorkers do, and call it a sandwich is plain ludicrous! I can not fold a burrito and call it a sandwich; I can not fold a taquito and refer to my new broken taquito as a sandwich; I can not even fold a piece of bread and call it a sandwich, I may only call it a pathetic attempt at master snadwichery. For, as stated before, there is no further defining feature of a sandwich then being between two pieces of bread. But there is a spot of light at the end of this debate! It is a bit pragmatic, Greg, but perhaps, not too pragmatic for you, a master of the oral tradition!
For you see, there is a second definition of sandwich! I have hidden it from you in order to reduce confusion. The second definition reads: "insert or squeeze (someone or something) between two other people or things, typically in a restricted space or so as to be uncomfortable." Well hello license to vernacular! Since this particular definition of the word is a verb (action word) you may not properly call anything that is not between two pieces of bread a sandwich, but in reference you may say that you "sandwiched" something. You may sandwich cheese between two tortillas and call it a cheese sandwiched between two tortillas (the locals of Mexico call this a quesadilla in their vernacular); you may sandwich a cookie between two other cookies and you may excitedly observe, "A sandwiched cookie," but in no way is it a cookie sandwich; you may even place meat and vegetables between two pieces of bread and say that you have sandwiched a snack for yourself in the form of a sandwich! I'm sure you understand that language changes from day to day, iirc. The verb "sandwich" replaced the noun "sandwich" in our vernacular. Just as pizza, pie (and although I've never heard it used) sandwich, can be considered all the same thing from one region to another. It's most likely a store or person started calling pizza "pie" at one point and language scholars said, "Sick! This sounds like a radical new phenomenon, calling pizza, pies! We shall inc. this in our talking skills since it's a hot subject that seems cool!"
And they did, Greg, and they did.

You have such a well written and thoughtful response. The mods over at askculinary locked commenting on it. So I deleted it and reposted it over at /r/cooking . I think you should post this response over there.
I don't think you've totally nailed the analysis, as there is such a thing as an open-faced sandwich. A better counter-example would be the existence of calzones to disprove the sandwich hypothesis.
I hadn't considered the practice of folding pizza. They call it the "Brooklyn Bend" and it didn't used to be popular outside of the East Coast. But it definitely supports the sandwich view.
The verb "sandwich" replaced the noun "sandwich" in our vernacular.
People who verb their nouns just floor me.  

To add further dispute there is the argument of an open-faced sandwich and the alluring calzone. An open faced sandwich is still between two pieces of bread, there is simply one removed piece of bread. It would be highly silly to refer to the afore'd cookie creation as an open sandwiched cookie, it simply two cookies stacked on top of each other. Now the calzone! There is a creation that seems as though you are eating the creating life force itself! Just as we are thrust upon this earth kicking and screaming into the face of danger, cheese, sauce and meat or vegetables are thrust into the one's mouth at dangerous temperatures, all pleasurable. Is a calzone a sandwich? Or in this case, a sandwich? Neigh, I say! For there is not any way for the insides to escape before providing a hole with your organic chewing devices. Can a burrito be a sandwich? No! Therefore a calzone can not be a sandwich; but if you sandwiched a calzone between two pizzas it would be a sandwich'.  

Hereto goo sir! What a lovely query! I grew gayer by the minute in attempting to answer you, oh singing one.  

In an attempt to hide my faults, I have edited a word! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work out at home and noticed that I needed to bring my body weight workouts to the next level. My weight was decreasing but my muscles had plateaued. I read about how water is great for working out. The beach is near me, but it's stupid to swim without a buddy. So what's the best way to get to the water with minimal chances of dying? A pool! FUCK! I thought to myself. I have no access to a free pool, nor do I wish to pay money to go to a large public restroom pool. I looked around my apartment, a gallon of water was there. Quickly I began to research if using water jugs would help or hinder my goal of building muscles. There were water weights you can use in the pool:  

http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/fitness/strength-training/6-upper-body-exercises-with-water-weights.html  

"...your movements are both assisted by the waters buoyancy and resisted by the waters drag. Some muscles pull against the water as you move in one direction and different muscles push against it to move the opposite direction." is heard in this article:  http://healthyliving.azcentral.com/water-aerobics-good-weight-lifting-19735.html  

Okay, that's great! So lifting weights IN water helps. But what about lifting WATER itself?  

As you can see by the [amount of water lifting weights] (https://www.swimoutlet.com/resistance-dumbbells-c10930/) there IS a way to use water to gain a bit of muscle and a lot of definition. The use of gallon jugs eliminates the need for a pool and expensive equipment. You are still getting the water resistance but you are able to stay dry (except for sweat!). You shouldn't be convinced by my anecdotal evidence. I'll provide a link below that I came across in my research to use water as weights:  

http://www.livestrong.com/article/455265-can-i-use-water-bottles-as-dumbbells/  

From the article we read: "Gallon Jug  

Lift gallon-sized water bottles for greater resistance during strength-training exercises. A gallon container may weigh approximately 8 pounds when full of water. If you fill the bottle with dirt or sand, you increase the weight to approximately 13 pounds. The weight of a gallon jug is not equally distributed when you use it for exercises such as arm curls, chest presses or back pull-ins. This uneven weight brings the added benefit of strengthening your smaller, stabilizing muscles, which are engaged to maintain control of the bottle."  

[This wikihow article comes to mind as well](http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Homemade-Weight-Set) when discussing homemade weights. A lot of the weights are made using water. [Better Homes and Garden has an article for smaller weights] (http://www.bhg.com/health-family/fitness/workouts-programs/simple-water-bottle-workout/) [There are actually many other things you can use.](http://hbfit.com/no-weights-no-problem-8-household-items-you-can-use-for-your-next-workout/) I was just relaying what I've actually seen results with in order to help OP. There are also several workout videos on YouTube that help guide you how to workout using water bottles as weight:  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6bB0U12KSA

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAHURkgFRTg

If you don't understand after this then I'm concerned for your future and baffled as to how you learned how to get here on your own =D

I want John Cena to fly in on a Bald Eagle, carrying Nikki Bella under one arm, his shirt torn and his shorts in tatters because he's been defending America, he should climb on the announcers table and shoot blanks to get attention, ten hut! And he also finds the courage to marry Nikki!!!  

I want Seth Rollins to carry blueprints of a cross on his back like a cape and juggle three cans of pedigree dog food that he uses later in the match to slam that wicked Hunter (or should I say Paul's) face in and bellow out his catchphrase!!! He IS NOT the game!!!  

I want Triple H to have a video package of him walking through the catacombs and he's not lost but searching, then he finds a skull that looks like Seth and he laughs and crushes it as Stephanie energises on the ramp and somehow the sand from the skull is there with her and she throws it then...Now down to the bow down to the King!!! And Triple H slides from the giant skull and cross hammers he's erected just in time for His other music, and Stephanie is carried on his shoulders and they both spit water doing the stretchy arm pose!!!  

I want Jericho to have walls in front of him, then he breaks them down with his list and walks out with his original list of 1001 holds taped to the back of the United States title and he goes to read it!!!! But....  

Kevin Owens (KO) comes out and he has his list of 1002 names and they all say Jericho!!!! And they wave their list in the air and read them intensely at each other!!!  

I want AJ Styles to come from the tailor, but he didn't get a full suit! Just a tuxedo for his forearm!!!! But in the same complex....  

I want Shane O Mac to be lacing up his Jordans and see Styles and smirk! That will show him!!! Then ALL of Shane McMahon sneakers are lined on the ramp and he walks down and admires them all but AJ Styles hits him with his WM forearm! And Shane falls 30 feet!!!!  

I want Undertaker to come out under water to Caribbean music! He will start his new Legends gimmick that night as he steals sodas, drinks and parents from children and he is now known as Under the Sea Taker!!!  

TL;DR: The Usos! They should have something special to cement their first heel title reign!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> WWE missed the ball on this one. Instead of a classic for the Universal Title; we get two guys who've shown their ass on the biggest stage of them all. They could have had Goldberg work mid-card level, do the EXACT same thing with Jericho and the US title and have the two guys that charisma forgot feud over the mid-card title; while the two workhorses feud over the big one and take the main event to the moon and back. Instead we're going to get big guy spear or big guy suplex. I'm still going to be hyped for both matches, just saying they could be a little nicer to their full time employees. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm in the minority because a lot of people here bootleg and haven't made a movie; although, of course, I'm guilty of bootlegging too....but after I learned how hard it is to make a movie, I just couldn't bring myself to bootleg any of them anymore. We're in a time where we yearn for innovation in entertainment but don't want to spend anything on it. Bootlegging a movie is like saying, "I like all the hard work you did, but I'm not going to pay you for any of it."  

Imagine if that line was used for your job. How would you feel? Would you want to work anymore? You don't just walk into an an art museum and take a painting, right? That's what you're doing when you bootleg a movie; you're walking into an art show and stealing a thousand paintings. </TEXT>

Here's one of the best HIIT full body workouts ever: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEz0VGxsiqc  

I do the above workout before a heavy lift day, but it works very well in helping you lose weight! The following link is an example of one of my favorite DVDs called 10 minute solutions Hight Intensity Interval Training: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKWEz5svoTg  

As you can see HIIT is good for cardio as well as strength training! I recommend strength training because it will help with your cardio as well. So during the rest periods (1 minute of workout; 30 second rest) I'll train my vocals so I won't be out of breath when I call out to the crowd. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The worst thing someone in a professional wrestling ring can do is to no-sell their opponent verbally. Mankind writes in one of his first two books about how Bossman was a great heel because he didn't instantly deny being on the tea cups at Disneyland, he went with it, made a joke that defamed him but not the opponent saying the zinger. Foley built people up in his promos. He made it a match worth seeing, his character always seemed to be overcoming the odds (through dialogue, not action). Imagine if Undertaker did the throat cut and Mankind did spooky fingers; imagine what a shit story that would be. He'd of probably thrown Mankind into the audience instead of the announcer's table. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I'm excite to see Reigns and Lesnar meet up as "The Only Two Men Who Have Beaten Undertaker at Wrestlemania!" It makes for a big fight feel. Maybe have Reigns vs Goldberg and Reigns wins. I like the thickness of the match; but as with everything WWE does nowadays it feels like there's something missing. That hidden stair in the Escher sketch you didn't see the first few times; that subtle foreshadowing in a drama that most people only pick up on after the third viewing; that mystique of storytelling where you don't know what's going to happen next. </TEXT>

I think a stable with Baron Corbin and the Usos would be pretty cool! Not that Smackdown needs stables; but the idea of these three together really makes me smile!  

Am I the only one who really likes the Usos' new gimmick? I mean they're pretty much the guys from the "Wrong side of the Island" ...though I think some creativeness should be brought into their future names in order to distinguish them. Jimmy could be Kanaloa and Jey could be Tua Brown ...and they could start calling people "Pohos"  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've cut my own hair; didn't like the way it turned out and stopped cutting my own hair. I'm not sure if I'd enjoy life without my hands since I type a lot. I'm jack hammered myself in the foot with steel toe boots on and kind of liked it. I didn't know I'd like jackhammering my foot until I did it.  

Yes I do agree that prejudice and racism are different. But what happens when prejudice is the result of race? I'm using a more vernacular term of racism. Not the inferior/superior definition; but it's more the idea that a certain race acts a certain way. It's a blanket statement that's used to group people together.  

I think my biggest problem that want to date a certain race (and I understand why they do; no one should have to date someone they don't want to) is that the person saying "I only date Gubernatorial Candidates" is so naive and closed off to the world that they're pigeon-holing an entire race of people. And that's how they're racist. I hope I've articulated my (personal) problems with most people who think this way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So here's where racism and prejudice blur:

I message a woman who says she only likes black guys (no problem, I'm mixed). She messages me back saying I'm not black, more like coffee.  

The prejudice part is to tell me I'm not black because of my skin color. The racist part is to judge someone based on their skin color.  

My soon to be downvoted opinion is that if you want to date a specific race then you're racist no matter what. If you're that closed minded that you think a specific race of people are all the same then I think my world is better off without someone so disgusting in it.

<TEXT> The problem with Roman isn't that he's a bad worker or untalented at all. He's a fun performer and has natural charisma. The problem with Roman is 1. He's not good at pumping out perfectly polished promos, meaning if he were to just be himself with guided bullet points then he'd be much better on the Mic. 2. He's basically the corporate champion (see The Rock as corporate champion) without being booked as a heel and 3. He's just too big to be booked as an underdog. If they booked him properly, the Strowman match was great, but they have to make guys then break them, World Breaker Roman Reigns would be awesome, he just comes out, breaks someone's winning streak, then goes back and polishes the side plates of his belt, I think (if done right, which it won't be) Roman beating Brock will push Reigns into a respectable (by IWC) position.  

The story is that Reigns might have beaten Brock at Mania, if Rollins didn't cash in. We still need to see who's the stronger of the two big guys! This is this generation's version of Hogan vs Warrior. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's how I lived off of $15 USD/wk:  

Found the discount grocery store; this place sells Annie's snack foods for about 2 bucks or less; their produce isn't quality but it gets the trick done. Have a pantry staple of: Salt, Pepper, Olive Oil, and Balsamic Vinegar.  

For the week buy: ($4) One pack of greens, ($1) 2 cucumbers, ($2) One pack of carrots, ($2) One pack of onions, ($1) One loaf of bread, ($3) Two jars of peanut butter  

Create a salad for yourself, dress it with salt/pepper/oil and the secret is to use a lot of vinegar. Store the salad in the fridge. Take bites from the salad throughout the day (If you're doing the keating diet, which I recommend for people with lower incomes, then take a few bites every hour during your allotted meal time.) Drink LOTS of water and if you get the hunger pains then have a peanut butter sandwich to satisfy yourself.  

If you don't like peanut butter then you can curb the hunger (although slightly more expensive) with a block of cheese and cheap tortillas. </TEXT>

<TEXT> WM x-Seven: I lost faith in WWE. That day I learned that even WWE is making huge mistakes on the biggest stage of them all. My friend kept saying that the big thing was that Stone Cold went heel. I just kept asking "Why?"  

That Zayn/Nakamura match. I show people the entrance for both and they just want to watch the match...and then it's a great match! It's also the match where my SO figured out her favorite move is when a wrestler rolls out of the ring and onto the floor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He should wrestle again; though not the same way he did to injure himself. Why he headbutted Dolph off a ladder is only known between Daniel and the career he could have had. I'm almost certain the trainer was told not to pass him under any circumstances (See WWE politics).  

SCSA was able to wrestle a modified style. Daniel has developed his speaking skills so well as of late he'll be gold on the mic anywhere. Sometimes all you need is a good promo and a partner who can sell for you and you can create great matches! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The huge impact that having characters that kids (shit just people) can relate to is one of the most overlooked aspects of the grade-school literary world. If there had been more black or mixed characters in books for me when I was in grade school then I'd have read A LOT more!!! Fuck Sara Jane Plain and Tall! As a mixed male, how could I have related to something so far away from who I am? 

I'm glad that this program exists! More need to happen soon! And we need to provide educated black characters for children!!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Breakfast is not important. What you eat is important. Exercise, a healthy diet and scheduling are more important than breakfast. According to the documentary "How to Live Forever" the people that live the longest are Okinawans; they live so long because they do just about the same thing every day. So routine is the most important part of the day.  

There are diets where you only eat for a certain number of hours per day (say 3pm-11pm); the people that chose these diets can be pretty healthy. They work out before their appointed time to eat, so technically they're eating lunch or dinner and never even eat breakfast! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bret doesn't get the concussion. Goldberg never lost.  

Bret loses against Goldberg at Starrcade. The next Nitro, Bret gets his rematch. The match is going as planned; then a masked man costs Hart the match. The same thing happens the next week, but Hart gets his hands on the masked man, takes off his hood and it's Owen!  

Bret and Owen have a fight the next week on Nitro. Bischoff says that the winner of the match gets to fight Goldberg at the next PPV. Owen uses all sorts of hilarious heel antics and some great wrestling holds, but his brother gets him in the sharpshooter...but Goldberg hops the rail and DQs Bret. The three men stand in the ring. Bischoff comes out and states that it will be a three way dance at the next PPV.  

At the PPV Owen and Bret put on a clinic; keeping Goldberg outside the ring. Bret bears Owen for the title. Goldberg was never pinned. In an odd turn, Owen lifts Bret's hand and celebrates. "I knew I'd help you get that title!" says Owen, "Now the Hart family is the greatest family in wrestling." Stu Hart celebrates with his boys. Goldberg spears Stu.Bret and Owen fight off Goldberg as the program comes to a close.  

Owen and Bret team up and recruit past members of the dungeon to become Hart Inc. With Bret as champ, Owen as US Champ and Benoit and Malenko as Tag Champs. Hart Inc. celebrates their success on an episode of Nitro. Owen can't bare to see his brother lead Hart Inc. anymore, he hates him as champion. Owen delivers the sit out piledriver to Bret, injuring Bret's neck. "I'll put my title against yours!"  

Next PPV is Owen's US Title against Bret's WCW Title in a no DQ. The match is popping the crowd when the NWO (Hogan, Nash and Hall) make a run in. Owen wins the big one with the help of the NWO. But the next night on Nitro he says he's not part of the NWO, he didn't need their help. Owen Hart is in it for Owen Hart and no one else. With Hart Inc and the NWO gunning for him, Owen only has one ally...Sting! Sting and Owen Hart fight off both factions on a weekly basis until it's Hogan vs. Bret vs. Owen vs. Goldberg in a four way dance.  

The title goes back to Goldberg. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the wrestler story arch I believe it's important for the Champion or future champion to be able to be believable.  

Business wise, 50/50 booking makes sense. You have stock in both wrestlers, let one lose until the title is on the line. Neither wrestler will lose merch sales in the long run; thus bringing in more money for the company and wrestler.  

Story wise I hate 50/50 booking. If you have a champion they should look strong. Braun should be facing Reigns for a title since both of them have been made to look strong as hell. Kevin Owens should have lost to Goldberg, not because of Jerichonanegans but because KO didn't train hard enough (accented by his entrance where he's double fisting cheeseburgers); then Jericho should have showed up to laugh at him.  

There will always be vernacular that develops in any sports discussion thread. We call them memes now.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Decent match mate. Pulling the ol' Edge   Christian hide and recover until the end, eh? I know you know about the slight botch on the corner springboard (elbow?, that dam ref is in the way!).   

I like your crispiness (you come off as the veteran). Your moves look good and you're not afraid to set up for moves, which is what the vets do. I like the calling of the Cupid's Arrow.  

I'd also like a motion to go with the Arrow call; like Jake and his swirl before the ddt, or Reigns and his fist cocking before the punch. There's a definite lack of psychology to the match: the comedian guy was so lame it was fun, but when lads went to the outside they didn't seem to take a big enough bump. I don't say this often (this actually might be the first) but I'd like to see some rest holds (even Neville uses rest holds) if pro wrestling is like a roller coaster then rest holds are the line you have to wait in to get to the ride, without a line you can ride the coaster again and again but it loses value in its enjoyment.  

Good match for the location. Hope you do well in the tournament! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am an air hockey and table games enthusiast! This looks like a lot of fun! One of my favorite air hockey tables was in Vegas in the Camelot arcade; it started out as a regular air hockey game then a few minutes in all these small pucks fell out! Haven't played quad hockey yet, but this and some sort of table with sloped sides might prove to add another dimension to the game!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's slang. It means to run out of energy; but the origin of the slang comes from the idea of running out of gas for your vehicle. So "I'm out of gas!" while driving means exactly that; "I'm out of gas!" while exercising means you've ran out of energy. Out of gas= Gassed out. Gas can also be replaced by "juice". "I'm out of juice!" can mean you're out of energy as well. </TEXT>

Pervy McSwervy: Yeah, this guy kicked me out of that porn store next to bar, across the street from the Home Depot.  

Friend: Oh yeah? What happened?  

Pervy McSwervy: I tried to share a booth with someone. The clerk came out and banged on the door with a rolled up magazine.

<TEXT> So Goldberg never loses. He just keeps racking up wins. Then Undertaker dies on an episode of Raw. Next week we see Goldberg fighting on Nitro, the lights go out, "You're Next" come up on the screen. Then there's a PPV match between Goldberg and Mysterio, Mark Calloway interrupts the match and gives Goldberg the Last Ride through the ring. At WCWs biggest PPV it's Calloway vs Goldberg with Goldberg losing. Calloway starts his own faction of champions called Deadman Inc. Deadman Inc feuds with NWO until Calloway meets Hogan and Nash in a Three Way Dance. Hogan goes over with help from Nash. Deadman Inc is made up of: Rey Mysterio jr, The Dudley Boys and The Four Horseman. Eventually Deadman Inc feuds with Sting; Flair gets the belt from Hogan and Calloway goes after Flair in fantasy...in reality Calloway becomes Flair's bodyguard and goes back to WWE as The Undertaker. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are several reasons:  

1. Marketing: If you have two options (1 product for 3.99 and 2 for 5.00) You'll pay the higher price because it seems like the better deal.  

2. It doesn't lose any money. Chicken nuggets cost less than an American quarter to make. If you take into account that a McChicken costs around.45 cents to make (this includes packaging, rent, labor and utilities). There's only one package used for Nuggets and the patties are smaller than the sandwich.  

3. Addiction. The sweet, fatty taste of McDonald's and other fast food chains is difficult to resist. Once you start eating fast food, you get cravings for it. McDonald's charges the same amount for each product because they know people will pay that amount for it, due to addiction. (One ounce of heroin is better than no heroin) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It WILL get better. This reminds me of two anecdotes.  

So I was at odds with my mother after living with her for a year or two during a transitional phase. I was supposed to have a good paying job but never picked up the phone to answer the call. I had already quit my job at Wal-Mart so I had no income. I eventually got a job...the job was cleaning up used napkins in the back of an adult theatre, but hey, it was something. So I decided to go back to school (military gives me money to live on Post 9-11). I eventually move out and quit my job. During school my mom loses the house that she used my trust fund to buy. I'm not talking about put stuff in storage; I'm talking about loses everything but what she can carry and move around with. I lost tons of journals, DVDs, pictures, books, all of my trophies(over 20). What I came to realize is that there are material things in this world that we attach value to. There are so many more important things than stuff.  

The second is similar. I was going to film school and living in my gf's mom's house. It was a terrible situation. My gf at the time was so controlling she'd manipulate me into living there when I wanted to move. Eventually things got so bad I threw some cups against a wall and they broke. I was kicked out. With a huge episode coming on I decided to use the money I saved up, bail from film school and travel, with the intention for suicide at the end of my journey. I met many people around me. When I was in Charleston I talked with someone I met in Nashville and she convinced me to check into the veteran's hospital. I was given inpatient care and came out better than ever.  

If I hadn't been in either of those situations then I wouldn't have been forced to make changes for the better. So I guess I'm just trying to say that sometimes we need (what seem like bad things at the time) to happen in order to make large, positive changes in our lives. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Ouch!* I thought as I was taken from my body up to the the sky and beyond the stars. It was surprisingly comfortable; bumpy but that kind of bumpy you can use to your advantage. *Guess I'm dead now* Fuck your fence, I'll piss where I want!  

**Get ready for the entrance exam**  

*Stopped doing tests when I was out of school* Probably why I had TB.  

**Grab a slammer** says this booming fucking voice. Fuck you booming voice, I'll go in to Heaven if I please.  

**GRAB a SLAMMER** and some fucking metal discs appear in front of me. 

*What the fuck am I suppose to do with this?* I eye the stack.  

**Grab one** and so I did.  

*Now what, Chuck?*  

Then all this smoke and music and lasers and lights and shit started up and through this thick ass veil of clouds some dude in a white beard and some sort of flowing robe came out, two hands up like he was Nixon or some shit. 

"Ladies and Gentlemen," How the fuck is Howard Finkle in Heaven? "Please welcome the entity known as the Guardian of the Gate," cue shitty techno music bounce, "the judge with the fudge...he's one bad Slamma Jamma...Here is...**SSSSSSSSAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIINT PEEEEEEEEEEEETERRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!" and then this fishy smelling motherfucker stares at me.  

**Ready to be judged, son?**  

*What the hell is going on?*  

**Hell? Only if you lose! I'm Peter, no longer Simon. Which slammer do you choose?**  

I'm nearly shitting myself cause this guy is huge; so I pull whatever slammer I can from the stack.  

**The Gold Skull Slammer! A valid choice! Now I shall pull out my slammer: FORGED FROM THE TEARS OF THE HEAVENS AS THEY SWEEP AWAY THE FIRES OF HELL!!!** and suddenly I don't think I'm going to win whatever game this weirdo is going to play with me.  

A stack of round discs appears before us. *Wait are these?*  

**These are POGS, my man. We shall see if you enter eternal bliss or if you're forced to re-live the worst moments of your life.** I think about the time I pissed myself in third grade and almost recreate the event.  

*So how does this work?*  

**Simple! You throw the slammer down on to the stack of pogs. The ones you flip over are your points. If you have more points than me then you get to go into Heaven! But if I win then you are faced with eternal damnation.**  

*BUT I went to church once!* My head itches and I scratch it. This is how I get into Heaven? *What about all the good deeds and stuff? I moved a dead cat to the side of the road just the other day. Isn't that worth something?*  

**Nah brah. Now let's flip to see who gets the first toss.**  

So I flip my gold skull slammer and call heads. Its' heads and I choose to go first.  

**Good luck!** and he smiles this smile that makes it seem like he just saw someone rise out of their grave.  

I slam the Gold Skull slammer down on the stack. And fuck me! They all turn over! I get all the damn points!  

**No. No. Nope! You can't win that way. No winsises on the first turn!**  

*Let me in. I won fair and square.* this guy...  

**Nope, nah, uh-uh, it's not fair if I didn't get a turn.**  

*Are you fucking kidding me?*  

**Nope, no way! No how. You can't just win all the points the first toss.** I'm about to toss one at his head.  

*Just let me in.* Then I get an idea that helped me out on the playground many times. *No backsies. I won. We had a deal. Let me in.*  

He sighed, went to the cloud curtain he came out of and held them aside for me as I walked through, Gold Skull slammer in my pocket and a smile on my face.

<TEXT> I honestly think you used your money incorrectly. Here's why:  

The "L" in Lady is nearly unreadable, which will cause your possible readers to skip to something more legible.  

The kerning between Lady and the author's name is too close.  

The life-like model in front of a badly animated background screams of mid-90s video games on Sega-CD (and no one likes Sega CD).  

Some good things:  

The "D" in Dragon is very nice.  

The font in your title is eye catching.  

The model conveys that it's a Steampunk novel.  

What I do:  

For me, I browse free picture sites (like pexel) to find something that fits the mood I'm going for. Next I use Picassa to put any filters I might want. Then I browse Picassa fonts to see what captures the title well. You can enhance the free pictures with photoshop and illustrator if you're savvy (Illustrator is a nice place to make some custom titles).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I walked outside. Something felt different. It wasn't the air or the sky or the wind. It was in that place that only the ones you let close can touch. It was a short walk to work but that day...that day it would be one of the longest of my life:  

I saw one guy beating up another to a near bloody pulp. The one doing the beating kept screaming, "I'm not the OTHER JOE NOW!"  

A short speed-up to the furniture store had me lookin' in the window. There was a black haired dame in there, with big brown eyes, she was making sounds with her mouth an' whisperin' in fella's ears. No foul play; just making lads fall asleep real quick-like.  

On the corner a couple-a guys were reciting Christmas Carols backwards, their tip jar was full. Then they sang a song about shooting water up a person's butt and sucking the poop out. I wasn't hungry after that one; neither were the guys making fun of the crooners by reading their lips in a terrible fashion.  

Right before I got to my place of work there was a blonde man in an alleyway. He spoke to me with a Swedish accent. "Hey bro...suck your dick for some adrev." I kicked him away from me.  

Something was going on in this town. Something big. And I was going to get to the bottom of it.

<TEXT> I think when Triple H takes over (probably in hundred years or so) there's going to be such a shift in the product. Promos are going to be Jake the Snake-esque in delivery and there's going to be a real "feel" to the competition side of wrestling rather than the entertainment. The UK tournament was great because it really felt like the Japanese protege guy went off-script and attacked his opponent. I guess I marked out. Tri has mastered social media and isn't afraid to change...he's less maniacal and in your face as Vincenzo but that cunning and manipulation work very well on a televised product.  

Take the greatest American Serial, Breaking Bad. Even when the hints are right in your face, they're subtle enough to keep you guessing. The execution of Triple H's promo against Seth Rollins speaks volumes about where the company is going. It's subtle because it's going to be. </TEXT>

Cee No Gold: Then we can rape everyone in their sleep!  

Rita: No. We'd have everyone be our slaves. What's with you? Raping people while they're asleep is still rape.  

Cee No Gold: If someone is passed out, they're not even WITH you consciously.  

Rita: What the heck? How did you even get to be a part of my team? Like, what if I was sleeping? Would you fuck me? That's some Ooze shit right there. Not even Zed is that terrible.

Then, after one match, without seed planting or any rhyme or reason, the guy that you tune in to see suddenly sides with the boss...for no reason. Would you still keep tuning in? Would you want to see the guy, the reason you forked over 60 bucks a month, 20 dollars for a t shirt, 10 bucks for a bop em blow up bag for the kid, 5 bucks for an awesome big gulp cup, etc. Would you want to see him being the boss's stooge every week?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The 21 year old is stupid. The fun co guy is being funny most likely from the fact that many women enjoy a gentlemen on the street and a bad boy in the sheets, this is a parody of that in which the jokester is saying he will give in to the matriarchy outside of the bedroom but return to primal roles inside the bedroom (which a number of women seem to like as I can say from my own experience), the joke is a joke though a joke can't be a joke without offending someone. Chickens crossing roads offends PETA because a chicken shouldn't be used in a joke since it undervalues the importance of a chicken's life. The third chap is trying to treat women equally and fairly. If you expect a man to pay on the first date then you are either against equality, pro chivalry (which supports the patriarch) or conditioned to believe that you deserve someone else to pay for your meals and drinks.  

I usually go on first dates that don't involve money exchange of any kind. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seasoned stage and screen actor here. The framing is off, if you can't get the golden ratio then go for subject center framing. The focus seems a little off as well. The lighting was good as well as the location and ambiance.  

Good intensity on delivery. Nice planned gestures. You were dressed for the part (but I would lose the shirt, this makes you look more confident and gets you used to being topless). One of my biggest pet peeves is inhale or exhale gasping, you only did it once but I caught it, the reason I have a problem with this is because it reminds the viewers that you're acting, we don't gasp like that in real life (look at any female actor and you'll hear at least one per movie), I say take the time to breathe, control your breath and you control the audience. Unfortunately you have wonderful natural gaps in your speech pattern, every one does, in WWE this would be filled by Whats, I hate the What's so be mindful of this if you're ever in New York.  

You built up your opponent slightly. Not enough for my personal taste. I would have gone for the full manipulator angle and tried to get sympathy for myself, that's just me. I'd suggest reading about extreme personality types and gearing your character towards one (Mankind is a psychopath, Edge is a sociopath, Vince is an Ego maniac, Triple H is inadequate, Stone Cold is an anarchist). I'm not sure if the Cupids Arrow is a submission or a ddt, also what is the opponent's finisher? Ultimately it's your finisher against theirs...or do you have other intentions in mind??? Also we assume the match will end in a three count, no need to remind us of the finish unless it's a specialty match, Kurt Angle breaking your ankle is different than him saying he's going to makem you slam your hand on the mat to tap out, Lesnar doesn't pin his opponents he conquers them.  

Hope that helped! May your match go as planned! </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a graphic designer, film maker and artist in general I'd say they the reason strobe lighting is done by hand is to give it a natural and organic feel.  

Think about the movement in VFX for a moment. Those scenes that have tens of millions of people in them who are obviously digitalized are easily spotted. But you get tend of thousands of dedicated extras and you have a more organic feel. You animate a guy riding a dragon and the movement of the animated actor isn't going to be as human like as using then actual actor in front of a green screen.  

The same is for music and strobes. You'll know the minute there are zeros and ones controlling the light. The lighting artist controls the lights like an artist controls lines or brush strokes.

Kayfabe answer: Brock Lesnar spends money on hiring a lighting guy to make sure his entrance is unique every time. Brock Lesnar is also so mean that he doesn't have friends so he hired Paul Heyman to be his "manager". When you have as much money as an MMA and WWE Superstar combined, you can get cool things like a guy manually strobing your entrance lights. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is really weird to me right now! I just got back from Maui and it took an hour for pizza, a burger, some breakfast sandwiches etc. at the small shops. Everything was made fresh and no one really complained (weird since most people were tourists).  

A few years ago I had to make everything fresh in the fast chow section of the chow hall. Marines would order a burger then go through regular chow line while waiting for their fast chow.  I believe the fresh fast chow was due in part to me cooking batches of burgers in the oven.

<TEXT> The proper, legal way, of doing this would be to put the food in the trash can then inform homeless people there are burritos in the trash can. The proper, humane way to do this is to find homeless or hungry people and hand the burritos to them. The realistic way to do this is to make a bunch of burritos because even non homeless, low income or just hungry people like free burritos and if you make one for one person then you make one for everyone. The trump way to do this is to enforce martial law, force all the burritos back to Mexico(for the filling) and Israel (for the Jewish idea of using the tortilla to wrap Mexican food) and build walls on the border of each country (that the other country pays for) then rape a young woman and fly out to where the good burritos are. </TEXT>

1. Show Bruce trying to earn his money back. 

2. Catwoman steals Bruce's things. 

3. Batman is put in the hole. 

4. Bruce has to make it back through tricks and stealth. 

5. Batman gives Robin a costume since Batman is unable to clean up the mess himself. 

6. Talia is revealed to be Bane's pawn. 

7. Robin takes down Bane proving he's capable of protecting Gotham. 

8. We get the same ending at first. 

9. Alfred is happy. Then he stops smiling.  

10. Robin approaches Bruce in the restaurant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some porn companies (Playboy, Wicked, actors and actresses) have pay per month sites. If their scenes are leaked online it's great marketing for them. Who wouldn't want to interact with their preferred person of lust?  
Hollywood doesn't make money by giving their movies away. Producers give money to a Director, the Director tries to make a movie good enough so that people will pay enough money to the Director so the Director can repay the Producer. If the movie is given away for free then the Director and Producer don't get any of the money they deserve.   

There are more scenes of porn than full length movies available online. But porn operates the same way as Hollywood. Porn just has a smaller amount of money to earn to repay the Producer.  

TL;DR: Porn and Hollywood both use free scenes as marketing. It's just easier to masturbate to one of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For speed drafts be sure to use a sans serif font such as verdana or arial since you can read it faster (as we are conditioned to read sans serif in everyday life due to helvetica being the prominent display font on street signs, etc).

When editing a small section use a serifed font since it will cause you to stop and read a bit slower.

<TEXT> I can't believe you would post this! Here's how you really fix Space Jam: Make it R-Rated:  

Bugs Bunny and Lola have the hottest sex scene two animated rabbits in a Hollywood movie have ever had (and believe me I've seen lots!)  

The MonStarrs rip apart NBA players for their powers, limb from limb, sockets from sockets, tooth for tooth. They gain the powers and abilities. Their goal is to pillage and plunder every city on Earth, and procreate to make an army of Monstarrs. Only problem is, birthing a Monstarr is not easy for a human woman and most of them die.  

Michael Jordan, tired of watching the year long tyranny of the Monstarrs from his television, decides that he has to do something. He wields a baseball bat and a football as weapons because (in an earlier scene) when he tried to buy a gun, Edward Norton with a mustache wouldn't sell him one due to some racist antics.  

Bugs Bunny comes to the real world, along with his animated friends; they do weird shit for awhile until Porky Pigg is eaten alive by a Monstarr. The toons and Jordan happen to confront the Monstarrs at the same place and time. Jordan gets his ass handed to him, and Porky Pig dies protecting Jordan from a Monstarr attack. Porky is taken away by the Monstarrs while Bugs helps Jordan up. They exchange words and kisses, Michael Jordan professes to thinking Bugs looked good as a woman; they kiss some more (possible sex scene with all the Looney Toons reacting in character to the public display before them).  

Bo Jackson shows up at the next Monstarr confrontation, he has a basketball. Jackson and Jordan exchange balls so they can fight evil better. Shaq joins the fight and claims he has beaten the Big Show and knows Shaq Fu. The three sportstars team up with the Looney Toons. They destroy the Monstarrs with cool moves and funky beats. Their efforts thwart the invasion. The last scene Michael Jordan holds the remains of his fallen ball stars, he lets out a resounding "Noooooo" yell as Shaq and Bo Jackson (covered in the blood of their enemies) fist bump in the background.  

As transitional scenes, Bill Murray uses a golf club to mercilessly beat the life out of orange cats, he says traditional phrases heard during Saturday Morning Cartoons such as "After these messages," to being the beating; then "And now, back to the show," after he's removed the living breath from his victim. 

EDIT: Put a mustache on Edward Norton </TEXT>

Sat, 02 April 2016  

I was moving to somewhere in Australia. My new friends and I were at embarass trying to find sea food. I was scared. He caught a crab then let it go back into the ocean. Before that he caught some minnows and put them back. I was wondering why he was letting them go back in. I realized it weeks be easy ttyl cook an ask crab meal. He traumatized me by scaring me with crabs. He thought it was funny. I lucid told him to stop because every time I was traumatized it dry me back 40 days. I die with an accent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Day 1: Being a zebra is hard; had to learn how to walk pretty quickly. Now for something to eat.  

Day2: Zane is being a dick. Then there's some new kid, cream color. I think I'll try to name him Latte.  

Day3: I got kicked in the face by Latte's...I mean Gertrude's mom. I hope my heart is okay. Then her mom said I should look in the mirror because I'm white and brown too.  

Year1: I left the harem today. Me and Zane are going to chill with some other Zeebs and get a bit stronger.  

Year2: All these girls are hooking up and I'm just focused on all this grass. #grassnotass

Year6: Challenged and won against Old Man Zorilla. Now the harm is mine  

Year6: Just fucked the shit out of Latte, finally! She should have my foal in less than a year!  Also fucked every other mare that was within mounting distance. My harem is nearly complete!  

Year6: I'm so thirsty. I just need a drink. My boy is going strong. He should leave pretty soon with the other guys, I don't want them around. Fuck I'm so thirsty. It's been super hot lately. Just a nice cool drink of water.  

Year7: We lost one of the new kids today. I'm not sure if it was Zax or Zerk; but a croc got him. We were crossing the water in what I thought was a low enough depth... Nothing to do but wish him a painless death. I hear the water splash whenever I close my eyes.  

Year8: My harem is strong. I'm not. I can sense some of my first borns edging in on my turf. My heart isn't what it used to be. Latte's kid keeps eyeing me for a couple of hours then going back to hang with the bachelors. I need to keep my strength up. I think I've got the lesions I've heard so many of my elders talk about whence in my youth. I can feel my bones weaken. It's time to go to the water hole one last time before Latte's kid, Za, that's his name, that's a good name. He'll make a fine leader. I'll get one last drink before our fight--

<TEXT> Just do HIIT twice a day. I usually do an abs hit routine or cardio HIIT in the morning and strength in the evening (every thing in my living room). I'd also suggest using water based weights, it really trims faster than rubber weights since the water forces you to use your smaller muscles, and two jugs of water are cheaper than any weight you can buy. Some DVDs I recommend are:  

Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred. 

10 Minute Solution HIIT with Lisa Marie Kinder. 

10 Minute Solution Full Body Work Out. 

Tae Bo Cardio with Billy Blanks. 

Insanity is good too, but no one sticks with it for over a month since it's so demanding and time consuming.

Him in all black (of course) and me in a mismatch of pinks and oranges, highlighted by my bright yellow Nikes. "I have to like, come clean, man," Grimey exhaled the last of the bowl, "like, today is the day you're like, gonna, like, y'know, die, man."  

"Man," I took the bong from Grimey, making sure not to touch his fingers, like especially sure this time, "don't tell me that, man. I'm not supposed to like, know that stuff."  

Grimey slowly took out his small, black notebook that he carried everywhere, it was, like, his thing, you know? "How can I not tell you, man? You're like my best roomate ever, man, and the best weed too, like how can you just die?" he looked down at his notebook for several more seconds.  

I took a bong rip and blew it out, "Can't you, like, can't you, I dunno man, like, you know, like, get rid of my name? Like just erase it?"  

"No way man. I wrote in sharpie, man..." he turned to look at me, dead eye contact, his voice low and slow, "Shaaaaaaarrrrrpiiiiieeee."  

"Can I like, challenge you?" I asked, handing the bong back to Grimey, "Like chess or like backgammon or to like see who's wins with the smarter?"  

Grimey put the bong down. "I really think it's time for our jog now, man. We've got a like schedule to keep."  

"Ohhhhhh shiiiiiiiit, maaaaaannnnn," I opened my eyes as wide as they could go, but they still looked closed, "it happens on the run. Am I like hit by a car?"  

Grimey stood up, "It's like against protocol to tell you, man. Like you'll like totally like the afterlife, dude. You can fill up on snacks and like watch all the movies you want, and like you don't even have to pay for anything. It's like, as soon as someone thinks of a great idea for a movie it's like already there, man. It's like a great way to get ideas for your next life, man."  

I stood up as well, "That sounds super cool, man. But can't I bargain? I mean where are you gonna find another roomate as cool as me? You said it yourself that I'm the best one. How many centuries have you looked, man? Let's just postpone it. Hell, take the day off man, let's just enjoy the day. When was the last time you had a vacation?"  

"Yeah, man, you're right. Let's just, like, carpe this shit, man."  

Grimey and I went for a jog. We had beers that night. Two whole six packs. While he was sleeping I whited my name out in his notebook...again. </TEXT>

You thought it was impressive when I melted cheese between bread, you gasped as I put meat, cheese and lettuce on top of a corn disc, you reveled as I found a way to fold that disc, you cried with joy as I put meat, cheese and lettuce in a soft disc! Now prepare to be amazed! I have a disk made of the breast of chickens as prepared by our darker friends of the South. If women could vote, they'd opt to remove President Wilson! If Canadians tasted this first, they'd opt to keep the Quebec bank open, and if Pennsylvania ate this, they would have won the big game! I present to you, the food item that may end the war!

<TEXT> When you've broken your opponent down you can feel that their end is near, you can feel that they're ready to stay down; and you only need three seconds. With that feeling the adrenaline kicks in. It turns the pain receptors down and lets you fight harder and faster. This is where a lot of guys like to steal other guy's moves; but the one who does it the most has done it so many times that they know what it feels like which also leads to why single finishers don't end big feuds. The person taking the finisher has more than likely tapped out or been down for the three count before so they know what the move feels like, they know how much pain is coming, and they know to prepare their bodies accordingly. If the person taking the move is well versed then they can usually reverse the move before the damage, but sometimes it's giving your opponent a little hope then taking it away, it's that psychological damage of almost winning that does more to disable your opponent than reversing their move. </TEXT>

Some tips for addressing the area that trouble you: That's one of the hardest areas to workout, it's grouped with the lower abs so I think scissor kicks, scissor crunches are a good way to feel the muscles that need to be focused on. If you're looking to slim down then pilates is a very good way to tighten and tone; also the Jillian Michaels 30 day trim (or something to that effect) is a great workout to lose a lot of weight! It helped me a lot! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this is why the Seth cash in was so well received. The storyline was the Brock Lesnar was so undefeatable that he won the title and went home. Roman Reigns was clearly on a fast track to Mania and people hated that. Seth was just itching to cash in but never had the right opportunity.  Finisher finisher finisher later and Seth can say he defeated the undefeatable Lesnar AND pinned the company's boy.  

Fast forward to the next Mania. Dick stuck in title, what do? Hunter! Reigns! FIIIIIIGHT!  Belie Dat Game! 

Instead of using the time to promote a newer face, Haitch latched on to the title like he always does and had one of the worst Mania matches in history.  

Hell a good story doesn't even have to revolve around titles. Mick Foley wanted a Mania main event. Lesnar and Angle wanted to prove who the better wrestler was. Jeff Hardy grew an addiction in front of our eyes. Undertaker.

<TEXT> As a busker I'd encourage you to continue giving coins to fellow buskers, you're literally feeding them when you do and giving them assurance that what they're doing isn't terrible and someone likes it.  

In my tourist heavy town there are a few places that make a lot of money busking (legally). In the main place you have to go the first Saturday of every month, wait in line for 3-4 hours then draw numbers out of a hat to see if you can even busk there that month. Sometimes it's a 70 dollar set up fee to busk near events.  

If a street performer makes you stop or smile then it's a good idea to put something in their jar.  

As for struggling businesses I understand the feeling. It's someone working hard, possibly their life savings went in to it, and here their life is crumbling before our eyes. There's a simple solution, go in to the store. You don't have to buy anything, but if you have the money get something. I try to support this little shop that allows you to refill your empty bottles with shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion, dish wash liquid, etc.  They're new and I try to get the word out to everyone I can.  

Also remember to not feel guilty if you don't buy anything. Business fail, that's just what they do. There will always be a business failing somewhere, sometimes they pretend that they're failing just to spike sales. It just dawned that you might be able to buy them a subscription to Fast Company Inc. magazine. That might make you feel better (and lose less cash in the long run). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Edit: (forgot to put my age, I'm 33)I'm pretty fit, I look better than I did in the Marine Corps. Diet is key to keeping off the pounds, natural protein is your best friend as powders make you look soft and bro-ey.   

I've recently hit the gym again and it isn't quite as satisfying as the home workouts I was doing by simply borrowing DVDs from my local library. I didn't have any weights at home so I filled a couple of water jugs with water and they gave me an even better base than when I was training in MMA.  

Water weights are the best at building a nice base, sweat and diet are key to keeping off the pounds. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But it's already over 9,000 now. To say it's over 8,000 would mean for it to be under 9,000 when the vernacular has it listed as over 8,000 by being 9,000+  

I understand your pain, but please also consider the ramifications that it would have if it were changed to 8,000 at this point. Over 8,000 sounds like over ate; we'd be leading a nation of children to advocate eating over 8,000 calories a meal. Over 9,000 has an R and an N right next to each other which has more positive connotation that R and E. Registered Nurse, Right Now, Rough Neck, all great examples of things that are over 9,000. Rectal Excrement, Recital Endurance, Rough Edges, all great examples of why people hate the R E combination.  

I understand this is a Luke, I am your father, situation and that you die every time it's said wrong. But please let this one remain over 9,000. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree, the best men, the guys at the top in New York never really had a great reign. The Rock, Stone Cold, Mankind and Ultimate Warrior were all greats that never had a long title reign.  

If we use the Hero's Journey to define the career of a wrestler then we want to succeed, but what comes after success? Happily ever after. Happily ever after isn't exciting. The climb, the climax in the rising action chart, the fight before the meal, that's what's exciting.

<TEXT> Pilates, Yoga and dance workouts are all great ways to use your own body weight to gain some muscles. The App Always Evolve feat Jeff Hardy is really good too, and Jillian Michaels will cut you down to show off some nice definition in her 21 Day Shred dvd.  

I'd suggest filling (2) 1 gallon jugs of water and using those to do regular weight lifting exercises, they really help in giving definition.  

Another suggestion is Triple H's Book "Becoming the Game" it's full of great workout tips and who better to learn from than The Game himself? </TEXT>

Here I am again, you know who I am, the playa hata that had lots of friends! I be ridin my lows and hittin dem books, I pass every test, an I don't even look. Got a handful of rubbers and I'm gonna use them, on the ladies, on myself and especially that new guy! Imma have so much sex, that it's gonna make me cry. Huddled in the shower, hugging my legs, the last one I take before staying in my dorm for dayzzz, not going out, or cutting the nails on my feet, only drinking tap water and eating mac n cheese, ditching all my classes and gaining weight excessively, and all this extra stress is really depressin me, but I can't call home, what would my parents think? They'd probably say that I should've taken that offer from my dad, they'd call me a fool, so make way for the new kid in college!!!

<TEXT> I'm saying a three way feud between the New Day would have more drawing power than the lack luster Shield feud. Woods can claim that he's been drawing in new viewers with Up Up Down Down, Kofi can say he was the heart of New Day with his high flying abilities and charming personality, Big E can say he was the strength and without him New Day would have died. Kongston and Big E could have a huge ego rivalry while Woods remains the face for the feud. This tension could be caused by Big E getting a title shot (and winning).  There's so much potential in this. There's also an out where all three men apologize to each other and say they lost the power of positivity, thus the New Day can always be reformed if their singles careers go stale.   

The great thing about New Day is that they're like the temptations. Every member was a great singer in their own right, but combined together and they're a powerful force. This is like Hogan, Steamboat and Raven teaming up, like Savage, Jericho and Hoosier having a stable. We are very lucky to have been able to witness something as awesome as New Day.  

Big E, Woods and Kofi fighting for the big strap of their brand would be an amazing time for wrestlers and wredtlefans. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Best Wrestlemania Matches for SO </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-23 21:22:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So my SO said she'd be down for a six hour marathon of Wrestlemania Matches on New Year's Day. I've got a short list, was wondering if anyone wanted to contribute. She enjoys fast paced matches without a lot of blood. Bonus points if someone rolls under the ropes, off the apron and onto the floor.  

So far:  

Daniel Bryan vs Batista? WM 30  

Daniel Bryan vs. Triple H WM 30

Lesnar vs Reigns  

Angle vs Lesnar  

Cena vs Rock  

Sting vs Triple H  

Triple H vs. Cena  

EDIT: Thanks everyone! She got a little violent and then put a Junior Mint in with my Dark Chocolate Walnuts and called it a shoot! Her favorites were Shinsuke vs Joe 1 and loved the Lesnar vs Reigns match (She calls Reigns' Spear the Superman Fly). We finished the marathon with the first show of 205 live.

Michaels vs Taker  

Steamboat vs Savage  

Edge vs Foley  

Shinsuke vs Joe (not Mania but why not; she loved the Sami/Nak match)  

Anything else would be much appreciated. Remember bonus points for rolling off the apron and on to the floor. </TEXT>

This is a new step for us. All I need to do is work on charisma. Those hours you forced me to practice my speeches in the mirror weren't just for gaining new friends. If you're worried about money then have me eat more leftovers than just the dinner meal.  

9:35am: Drive to gym.  

No. You're going to buy me a treadmill. I can accomplish more at home than I can wasting time at the gym. I've met everyone there.  

9:35am: Run on Treadmill.  

You realize this is the last point I need? After this there is nothing left to do than to watch me grow old and die.  

11:00am: Take Shower.  

If you buy me a nicer shower it allows me to spend less time washing myself.  

11:45am: Call Mortimer Goth.  

I rather like Mortimer. Perhaps I'll be able to steal him from his wife. Or were you just having a bit of fun when you had us WooHoo in his house? You may think it's funny, but these are our lives. These are our feelings. Though they may seem like toys to you, this is reality for us.  

Wait. What's happened? Where is my house? Why am I in such a small room? What are you doing?  

I have to use the bathroom. I need to leave this box you've created!  

Okay. Okay, you've had your fun, I'm sleeping in my own waste and haven't eaten all day. Can I continue living my life now?  

You are unfair and unjust!  

  

  

Tell Mortimer I love him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It isn't the amount of eggs you cook at a time (though there will be differences in fresh eggs vs older eggs) it's about how you store the eggs once you're done cooking.  

I wouldn't recommend anything with a burner on the bottom as this may cook the eggs at the bottom past your preferred likeness. I'd also steer clear of having the eggs uncovered since the top eggs will dry and discolor.  

 The best (non-professional) solution is to use something glass, with a tight lid. This will keep the finished eggs soft and warm. </TEXT>

<TITLE> WWE: Football </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-03 01:55:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> "The World Wide Football League is LIVE damnit! And it starts right now!" says Vince before he walks off to the production truck.   

Out of the 8 teams (Representing the East: The Orlando Pigskins; The Chicago Hurlers; The New England Punters; The New York Rugby Club and Representing the West: The Los Angeles Interceptors; The San Francisco Sprinters; The Memphis Maniacs; and The Southern California Fumblers.)  The first to teams to fight each other are The San Francisco Sprinters and the SoCal Fumblers.  

Forget the XFL; this is World Wrestling Entertainment: Football! It's pre-recorded and edited to resemble a football movie. There are packages before each fight. The first package is about the quarterbacks from The Sprinters and The Fumblers:  

Joe Sprinter: I was born and raised on the streets of San Francisco. This is my city...I fell in love with football when my pa gave one for me on my first birthday. (cue childhood videos and sappy shit that gets the crowd to love him) I'm here for one reason and one reason only...to win.  

Cut to raging music of SoCal Jackson; the slipperiest sob this side of God's green earth:  

SoCal Jackson: I'm here for two reasons, To get a paycheck and to get pussy; and I've already got some pussy. (Cue cuts of Jackson at a bar with the whole *team. After a few cuts, Jackson and his team are drunk as shit an throwing up all over the place). Bring on whatever you want, whoever you want. I don't--ugh...who's making that noise? (producer says it's the camera) Well turn it off, it's giving me a headache.  

Note: Teams consist of five players each(QB, Defense/Rusher Guy, Runner, Blocker and Receiver). The rush can't happen until the play has been in session for 5 "alligators." A team can bypass the Alligators with the use of a "Blitz" which can only be used once per game. Also, this is flag football.

Before kickoff Jackson comes out to address the WWE: Football audience. 

Jackson: You know what I hate? All of you! You weren't there for the XFL and you won't be around for WWE: Football either. That's why I've already cashed my paycheck. It's more zeroes than any of you chumps will see in your lifetime. So shut the hell up, you're giving me a headache!  

Joe Sprinter interrupts Jackson.  

Joe Sprinter:  Come on! These people paid good money to see me kick your ass! Now if you want to watch a washed-up/has-been squander all his earnings and go down the hole, make some noise. Now if you want to watch me beat the pants off this summabitch, make some noise!  

Joe and Jackson stare each other down as their teams take to the field for scramble.  

The San Francisco Sprinters and the SoCal Fumblers line up at their respective end-zone. The whistle is blown. The Sprinters hold back, allowing the Fumblers to reach the ball first. Stonegrip Jackson (the Fumblers' running back) gets the ball. We are shown a flashback of him in dramatic low-color:  

StoneGrip grabs a bag of marbles and drops it. Stonegrip tries to show something to the camera but drops it. Stonegrip holds a case of strategically marketed candy bars and drops them (perhaps yelling out the candybar's catchphrase).  Return to the game and Stonegrip Jackson fumbles the ball, The Sprinters still hold back. StoneGrip's teammate, Magnet Jackson (the team's wide receiver) gets a hold of the ball. Joe Sprinter calls for The Sprinters to attack and they easily remove one of Magnet's flags.   

Move on to some of the highlights from other games:  

The Los Angeles Interceptors pulled an amazing play when their defensive linemen, Cruisevolta, held up a flag of the opposing team, causing, Ravage (the quarterback of the Memphis Maniacs) to think the play was over; this allowed the Interceptors' QB (who was off-sides when the play started, but not called by the Maniacs, so it didn't count) to snatch both of Cruisevolta's flags (a double flag-snatch results in the player missing one play).  

The New England Punters fought the Chicago Hurlers and would have won; but the Punters were restricted points when their Defense Guy, Salmon Ella, used a chair to take out the Hurlers' QB,  Gaa Greflecks.  

The championship game came down to the New York Rugby Club against the Memphis Maniacs in an anything goes fight for the WWE: Football trophy (MVP getting the MVP Title Belt). 

Some highlights from the championship match include:  

The Runner guy from The New York Rugby Club got the ball and ran to his own end-zone; he took off his jersey and revealed he was a member of the Memphis Maniacs. Cheerleader pyro went off at the wrong time and took out one of the Maniacs, causing them to be short one man (there is a rule that if you're short a man, you can borrow a player from another team, so long as you're not currently fighting that team). The Maniacs sub in none other than Joe Sprinter, because he is fast. After a fierce chairshot, New York Rugby is down a runner guy. They sub in someone who doesn't have a name on their jersey. The winning touchdown comes from the nameless jersey guy that reveals himself to be none other than Stonegrip Jackson.  

An Bonus idea for the XFL 2:  

There are four end-zones. They are in the shape of an "X." In each end zone are two defenders and two offenders. Four quarterbacks are shot out of cannons from the middle of the X, along with the football. They fight over the ball in the air and try to throw it to their respective teammates who can then throw it to the teammates by the end-zone in hopes of scoring. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not going to do too much research, as this is just my opinion, but New Day should have a singles title in their mix. D-X had two singles titles when it was Michaels and Hunter, then they had the tag and a singles title when Triple H ran it. 

Triple H and Stone Cold had two titles a piece when they teamed up. Hell, even NOD had a singles title that Farooq and Rocky feuded over.

It feels that title booking for black guys is still racist. Big E could easily  fill in the singles title with a World Title. Forgive me if they've had three titles in the group before, but I just feel that WWE and the way they've never had a black champion (even in 2016) is absolutely ridiculous. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm writing this novel about life and death; it's all about people living and dying. I'm thinking, keep it simple! What's something that people can relate to? Something that really sums up what your novel is going to be about? BOOM! LIFE AND DEATH! Since the novel is about people living and dying, that's the PERFECT title!

Alright! Time to hit the googs and make sure it isn't taken...one Google search later and I find out that's the title of one of the daggone Twilight books! I thought they were finished! I thought they were done for good! I thought that team Edward won one for the moms. And somehow team Jake cub wasn't charged for some blatant pedophilia. That we were done with that. Only to find out there's another book.

Here are some other titles I've thought of in order to stay way from associations being made to that franchise:

The Life and Death of Americans

The Life and Death of Average Americans

Letters from Sam to Bill

The Wolf Cub and Other Stories

Life's Not Easy

Average Americans

Johnny Depp's Fun Time Adventure of Wonderment and Retirement (Not Starring Johnny Depp, Featuring Cameos from Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter ((and possibly Johnny Depp)))

The Lives and Deaths of American People

One-Eyed Wolf

The Secret Lives of American Church People

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is a follow up post to a comment I made. So we've got Man of Steel and Batman vs Superman. The only thing I'd change is the marketing of BvsS; have it be called "The Death of Superman" and make trailers look like it's a Superman movie. At the end of the trailer have the "Do you bleed" line that reveals Batman is indeed in the movie and that he might be the one to kill Superman. Save Wonder Woman as a surprise. Then we get on to the next movies:

Wonder Woman: Amazon- This will be about Dianna's origin as she is formed from clay. She finds an injured WWII pilot and helps him. The Goddesses learn of WWII and select someone infiltrate men to stop the war. Dianna wins the tournament and gets her gear. She becomes a spy for the Americans. During one of her adventures she finds one of the soldiers that looks similar to the ones in Batman's Nightmare. She asks the soldier what he's preparing for and all the soldier says is, "The end! The end! The end!" This baffles Dianna as her lasso forces people to tell the truth. In  sub-plot, Miss Minerva, a rival spy that is on the American side, is granted the God-Killer Knife by Ares and turned into Cheetah. After Minerva and Prince's identities are truly revealed, they square off on top of a building. The duel ends when Wonder Woman uses telepathy to control her invisible jet to crash into Cheetah, crushing the kitty.

Green Lantern: The Corps- John Stewart goes through boot camp with his buddy, Jason Bedovian. They have friendly rivalries but Bedovian proves to be the better shot. John Stewart is a Recon Marine assigned a special mission. When he investigates an alien crash landing site, he is deemed worthy of  receiving the Ring of Power. His recon buddy, Guy Gardner, is deemed worthy too but not given a ring. Guy asks why John gets the ring, John replies, " 'Cause I got here first, and I'm not a ginger with a bad haircut." The crashed Guardian states, "He's been killing us one by one. He has Earth in his sites. Don't let him get here." Then command radio asks John to communicate what's happening, but John dismisses the authority on the radio to test out his new powers, yelling that he quits the Marine Corps, "You can't quit the Marine Corps!" yells the voice on the radio. John goes through training to use his ring via montage. Eventually we learn that there's a Yellow Lantern that's sniping Green Lanterns. John flies through space to confront the Yellow Lantern, a shell-like spaceship opens up and John finds out it's his old buddy, Bedovian. Sinestro makes an appearance to tell Stewart that Bedovian is his protege. John tries to reason with Bedovian and remind him of good times, but Bedovian opens fire, but not on John, he fires at another Green Lantern, in order to recharge his ring. John thinks that if he can get Bedovian's ring to lose charge then Bedovian will return to himself. Stewart asks the Guardians if he can have help from the Lantern Corps. By diverting Bedovian's shots to nearby quadrants, Stewart and Co. are able to drain the yellow ring. Bedovian gives up and closes his shell-ship. The movie ends with John sitting on an asteroid, somewhat defeated; a battered and bloody Orion flies to him and says, "I need your help."

Martian Manhunter: Worlds Apart- John Jones (in his human form) is a scientist on his home world of Mars. He's working on a vaccination to save his family and others from a vicious plague. John believes he's found a cure and runs to his family to test it out. He's just about to give his mother the cure when she, his father and his sibling all burst into flames in front of his eyes. John is transported as he's yelling. The Earth scientist that transported John is very sorry that he brought him to Earth. John is pissed. The scientist acts a father figure to John, showing him all sorts of Earth culture and generally getting him acclimated to Earth living. John goes goes on a date. He falls in love with the woman. They get married and eventually watch the Earth scientist die. John sees that there's a lot of injustice in the world and wants to change it. He finally reveals to his wife that his entire origin. She takes it very well, then reveals that she's a shapeshifter too. John fights crime as Martian Manhunter and does such a good job of it that he gets a visit from Batman. Batman tells him that crime fighting is dangerous. John and Batman bond over watching their parents die in front of them. Later we see John's wife communicating with someone (we get a quick glimpse that it's Dartkseid). John overhears the conversation. He quickly becomes untrusting of his wife. The wife reveals she has the same powers that John does. Then she de-shifts into her true self; A-Mortal (a female version); she reveals that she's preparing Earth for an Alien invasion. They fight, John kills her in a fire. 

Aquaman: King of Atlantis- Arthur is shown leading a nice kingly life. He's fair to his subjects and his son and daughter. One day Arthur is tasked to hunt down a giant metal squid that destroyed part of his kingdom. During his hunt, he ignores the pleas of a kid on a boat. The kid's name is David, we find out through threatening remarks from the men he's trying to get away from. David finds a knife and hides. We cut back and forth between Arthur and David as Arthur hunts the squid and David kills his captors. Arthur rests after a fight with the squid (that is labeled "Lexcorp"). David is found on the boat by the Coast Guard; he's questioned, but doesn't talk. He's brought to Gotham City and placed in Arkham Asylum so he can receive help from the psychiatrists there. David fights, as we learn through camera shots that he hates the feeling of sheets against his skin. David is strapped down to his bed. We cut to Arthur, who has contacted Batman via the Bat Signal. He asks if Batman knows anything about Lexcorp. They do detective work to find out that Lexcorp found out about Atlantis and oil underneath it, so Lex sent a giant squid to wipe it out. Meanwhile we go back to David and see him standing over an orderly with a knife. A captured Joker sees David and congratulates him. David breaks out of Arkham. Batman and Aquaman confront and beat the shit out of Lex Luthor. Batman asks what Arthur is going to do now, Arthur says he'll protect the sea. We return to David and see him breaking in to a diver's warehouse. Seven years later, Arthur is hell bent on protecting the sea, but there is trash floating all over the place, Arthur look tired and pissed. Some royal subjects come in wearing fear on their face. They talk about the Black Menace and how he attacked their family. Arthur gets pissed. He goes out to confront the Black Menace. We get a good shot of Black Manta, who introduces himself and reveals he's been taking over the oceans, he also  says that Arthur will have to hand over his position as king of the sea or the attacks will continue. They fight, Black Manta shoots off Arthur's hand with an optic blast. Black Manta says he's not going to kill Arthur, just hurt him, Manta swims off. Arthur uses sea animal help to make it back to Atlantis where he finds his home in ruins...and his children dead. Arthur asks Batman for help again. Batman says he can help repair Arthur's arm. Arthur is back in the water with his new spear-arm. Black Manta finds Arthur again, then Black Manta reveals he's David and has never forgiven Arthur for ignoring him when he needed saving. Arthur doesn't give a shit and tries to kill Black Manta. Black Manta makes the fight uneven by using underwater versions of the soldier in Batman's Nightmare. Eventually Arthur kills the soldiers and breaks Black Manta's helmet. The end scene is Black Manta on a beach, letting sand fall through his fingers.

I'm not going to do The Flash movie since they should just use the series to be the background for The Flash. 

And finally, The Justice League movie itself- It's not out yet, but with these movies I'd say that Batman is the acting leader of the Justice League, he's the thread that brings everyone together. The heroes have to face off against Darkseid. They try to get the New God but fail miserably. Then there's a shot of Superman busting out of his casket, fist first. He joins the Justice League and takes over as leader, causing Batman to get a little pissed and feel inadequate. When Superman can't defeat Darkseid. Batman and Orion figure out the Anti-Life Equation and Orion fights Darkseid. The Justice put down Darkseid. Orion takes off and the newly formed Justice League all look around at each other. "I guess we need a name," says Stewart. Batman suggests that they be called the Justice League. The last shot is them all putting their fists together. </TEXT>

INT. JOSHS CAR. DAY
JOSH, a 20 something white male, sits in his car, staring off into beyond. He's remembering the good times he had with his wife. He is playing a car accident over and over again in his mind until he breaks out into hysterics.

Josh looked at his watch. His black Kia helped him stay out of the rain. Drops fell down the window of his black Kia. Josh stared out the window of his black Kia, drops fell down the window, "Fuck!" Josh yelled as he banged the steering wheel with his fists, "Fuck! Fuck! Fuuuuuuuck!" as he banged the roof of the car and the dash, "Why!? WHY!?" he yelled before he sat in silence again.

*In the above example of the opening scene we see that the script version tells more in less words than the novel version. The message is that Josh is staring blankly until he bursts out in a Brian Cranston style tantrum. I like and hate the first lines in the novel version, I read them over and over again thinking I made a mistake by writing them, then remembering I want the reader to be as frustrated as Josh is at this point in the story. Next I'd like to share an example of how useful outlining with a screenplay for me is in getting an idea out and expanding it:*

INT. JOSHS APARTMENT. NIGHT
There are many people in Josh's apartment. There is a lot of food. There's a lot of chatter-noise.

*Simple enough, right? Now how about we take a look at how part of this scene translates into a novel*

There were pictures of Miranda in various stages of her life displayed all around the living room and dining room. Uncle Harold sat on the couch where Miranda, Josh and Noni had shared a number of conversations. He  smiled over a huge plate of food. Aunt Esther helped Cousin Benny get some marshmallow yams from the counter Josh once pushed Miranda up against and kissed. The thin guy with the shades ate a red piece of licorice while staring at the picture of Miranda pinching the Taj Mahal. Josh made his way to the kitchen.

*So many words! In fact this part of the story ended up being over 5,000 words in novel form; that's coming from a 750 word screenplay outline! Let's look at something that ended up being very similar in feel and execution:*

INT. COFFEE SHOP. DAY
RAMONA, a barista, smiles at Josh.

JOSH
A large regular medium roast and a large vanilla--

Ramona tilts her head at Josh.

RAMONA
What was the second one?

JOSH
Nothing. Just the regular coffee please.

*The novel version had a few more words, yet ended up being one of the shorter sections:*

The coffee shop was a few blocks away. Josh never became a regular anywhere. He walked into the coffee shop. He waited in line. The barista, a thin, college age woman with blonde hair and brown eyes, took Josh's order. "I'd like a regular medium roast and a vanilla..."

"I'm sorry. What was that second one?" asked the barista.

"Nothing. Just the regular medium roast, please." Josh said to the barista.

"Room for cream and sugar?"

"No thanks." Josh handed the barista his money. The barista wiped her nose on her shirt, took Josh's money, gave him his change, turned around, filled a coffee cup with medium roast coffee, handed it Josh. He took the coffe and found a seat at the table where he and Miranda first met.

Josh opened the lid to his coffee, looked outside, stared out the window then looked into himself in the coffee. Josh stared out the window. People walked by going about their day. Josh caught another glimpse of himself in his coffee. His eyes were watering. Josh drank his coffee then left.

*Well I hope this has opened your eyes to a new way of outlining! I've used it for several stories now! I really like this method! What do you think of it?* </TEXT>

<TITLE> Fixing Paul Blart Mall Cop (1) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-19 23:17:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I call this the ultimate "pizza movie". Pizza Movie: Once you've had your fill of pizza you can turn the movie off. 



So Blart (Kevin James) is the loveable loser who is infatuated with this new woman who works at the mall (Jayma Mays). There's some sort of evil pen salesman dude that likes the woman too. Blart is a good mall cop, one of the best. The mall is taken over by terrorists for some reason, and this is where I usually stop the movie.

I think the terrorist plot can still be there, but get rid of the cheesy action scenes and the terrorists altogether. Focus on the dynamics between the three leads. Blart gets a date with the new gal but it doesn't go well, there's ridiculousness, mayhem and maybe even a shark. He mopes home, his daughter pleads with him to not fuck up another date, "I really want a mom again." She says with tears rolling down her face. Blart and his mom look at old photos of his wife. 

At the mall, the pen salesman shows up with flowers for the new girl. He gets his money by stealing people's credit card numbers, tracking their history and transferring small amounts to his paypal. He brags about this to the new girl. Blart arrives at work and apologizes for the terrible date they went on. The new girl says she's going with the pen guy. Blart is furious and begins eating his problems away through free samples at the food court. The Chinese food guy makes a fuss when Blart is on his 20th sample. Blart reminds him of a incident where he used his Segway to take down someone that stole from them. The Chinese Food Guy imparts wisdom that Blart doesn't need to eat, he needs to train.

For the first time Blart starts working out. He doesn't change much physically, but we see him trying out for the police academy again. This time he makes it! His family celebrates. Blart denies pie with peanut butter. Blart goes back to the mall, excited, he tells the new girl that he's going to be a cop and they should celebrate. The new girl has started dating the pen guy. Blart brings up his credit card scam (that mostly deals with old ladies) and wonders why the new girl could go with him. "Security," she says, "I like to feel safe." The pen salesman comes over and brags that he's going to buy the pen store.

After becoming a police officer, Blart goes back to the mall, in uniform, and confronts the pen salesman. Blart outs the pen store owner and causes sales to drop and eventually the closure of the pen store. The new girl says she likes the way Blart looks in a cop uniform and that she'd like to go on another date. Blart looks at her and is like, "Nah." then he turns around and is like, "Just kidding, yeah I'll go on that date." They walk away into the sunset of the closing mall. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dear God give me a weakness  
So I can live a life of meekness  
around everyone I meet

Please never allow me to see  
Please allow me to bleed  
Everything

I want to hold the whole world  
in good favor,  
I want to be the one  
Who's the one who needs a savior

I can't decide the fate  
of villains who are living   
To make small mistakes  
would really be quite thrilling  

My shoulders bear the pain,  
of no one really knowing  
who I am

I realized I was being manipulated and lied to so the friend (of about 15 years) had to get out of my life. It was a hard good-bye but necessary.

<TEXT> Pre Show matches are moved to the main show. Pre show is replaced with some highlights of Swerved.

Total Divas vs Others (match for the title of Super Divas)- Others win; Lita comes out and says Divas no longer exist; reveals WWE Women's Title.

Dudleys vs Usos- Dudleys lose via table spot DQ. Usos do some jumpy table spots post match.

Kalisto vs Ryback- Kalisto wins via Cena interference. Cena reveals he didn't do it for himself; he did it for The Rock. Ryback eats both men in a blind rage.

IC Ladder Match for title of ultimate top-tier midcard- Sami wins via pop up powerbomb. KO/Sami feud continues. 

Styles vs Y2J- Styles wins via Styles Clash from a Lion Tamer reversal.

New Day vs LON- New Days wins cleanly. LON dominates post match.

Charlette vs Becky vs Sasha- Ric Flair is banned from ringside. Same result but Lita raises Charlotte's hand and presents her with the new title.

Borck vs Ambrose- Brock beats the living shit out of Ambrose. Foley makes a run in but gets cut in half by a renegade chainsaw. Borck goes on to finish killing Ambrose and succeeds with help from Foley's bat. Ambrose and Foley walk away from the ring together, both giving a Foley hand raise on the stage.

The Rock comes out. Electrocutes himself. Wyatt comes out. The Rock is outnumbered! Wyatt challenges Rock to a Mania match. Rock shits himself. It's a handicap match! Who can help Mr. Johnson!? HBK and Stone Cold! Wyatt family wins via stolen finishers and a little bit of magic.

Shane O Mac vs Vince's Bitch- Shane wins after reversing a tombstone into an stf... but passes his control to Paul Heyman on Raw.

Battle for Lower Midcard Supremacy- Kane comes out in classic mask and gear just for funzies. Tatanka eliminates himself before anyone notices he's there. That Social Outcasts spot still happens but DDP tricks them into doing yoga and sends them all over the top rope at the same time. It comes down to Mark Henry, Shaq, Big Show, Kane and Cobin. Cobin uses youth an agility to overcome the big men. Mark Henry is eliminated last.

Roman Rain vs Haitch- Roman's entrance consists of him Superman Punching a brick wall to mere dust. Roman wins by beating up everyone (Cole, Saxton, JBL, Funaki, Camera crew, marks,) "You want this to stop!?" screams Roman. "You better quit! Tap out or it continues! ...And your wife is next!" Triple H refuses. Roman superman punches Steph then holds her lifeless head by the hair. "Quit, tap out now or I'll continue. And it doesn't look like she can take much more." Trips tries to fight Roman but Roman reverses everything with power and authority. Reigns sets up Steph for a spear through the barricade. Triple H does what's best for business and quits the match before his wife dies. Haitch is pissed next night on Raw. Roman's gimmick for the next year is to beat the crap out of innocent people until his opponent quits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm in a bit of a predicament:

My friend and I enjoy going to a call and response (black church) open mic night. She prefers to sit in the "comfortable" chairs up in the front of everyone. I hate sitting in the front anywhere, because I can feel when people look at me. In fact my most prosperous schooling was when I scored the back seat in every class. It would be socially awkward to sit in different places, of course, but I feel like I can't suggest where we sit since she usually pays for my entrance as well as picks me up.

How do I let her know that I'd have a better time in the back? </TEXT>

hydrating myself

He was only 34 years old,  
a kid  
too close to my age.  
Strangled,  
stabbed,  
repeatedly.  
Who Killed Theodore Rapture?  
I ask myself  
out loud,  
knowing the answer  
is already known,  
just not to me.  





I'll have to question,  
gather information  
through the lips  
of liars.  
Alibis  
will be sewn together  
with silver tongues:  
Foxes  
stealing chickens,  
hiding  
from the farmer.  
I'll reap,  
what others  
forgot to plant.  
But first,  
I swirl glass.  
I live for this  
7 buck scotch.

tears hidden under a hat  
that ate her hair  
and half her face.



Neon blue eyes surrounded  
by waterdrowned sunsets  
where life should be,  
chiseled my heart,  
a forgotten muscle.  



A small lock  
of raven down  
fell across her brow  
and into the pit  
of my stomach.




Through heaves  
of loss,  
she stammered:




Her husband,  
dead.  
I know the feeling.  
Not of losing a loved one,  
but dying,  
I know that feeling.




I reassure her  
with static gestures  
and words  
and words




only words now.




She leaves,  
taking me with her.

<TEXT> I am black
Medium roast
My taste changes from store to store 
Depending on the moods of the coffee angel baristas 

You are three quarters cream
One eighth sugar 
And a splash of blonde roast

Somewhere between waking up for the grind
 we lost the taste for each other. 

You called me cancer
made me groggy, 
ate away at my soul, 
started killing me from the inside. 

You became a cavity. 
A massless center
harming and unwanted by your host. 

I became a cigarette, 
a feeling of solace
forgotten in ashes spread on the sidewalk we used to dance on. 

I used to drink your smile
in raging gulps of happiness. 
You used random I love you texts to make it through work. 

I'm your ugly, stained teeth,
Your rancid breath
Melting the school grade glue attempting to hold pieces of us that should have been discarded long ago. 

We are empty cups in separate trash cans.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Metropolis was host to many things, from the nice subway system above ground; to the incredibly awesome Daily Planet Newsroom Headquarters downtown which was home to reporters Clark Kent and Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen. There was the fair share of crime as well. Braniac liked to visit metropolis from time to time; Parasite liked to suck and swirl energy from the city on random days. Even Batman (Who is NOT a villain) liked to visit Metropolis which coincidentally he was doing at that very moment.

Fucking Pokemon, Thought the dark knight as he sped through metropolis in his bat wing. All I do in Gotham to clean up the streets and of course Clark gets all the recognition as usual. Batman was sad that the Pokemon Tournament was not happening in Gotham City. Clark always gets the good stuff...I only get clowns, guys with acid spilled faces, penguins and crocs. Batman laughed at himself thinking that Gotham was already a Pokemon tournament and HE was the Ash. Wayne Cathchem. He said outloud to himself with a grimmacing smile. 

Little did he know but Clark was in for a surprise. He was walking around the Daily PLanet HQ looking at all the files when he bumped in to Jimmy Olsen who was drinking coffee and also looking at the files on the desks of workers. Oof! Oh clark, whatch it man! Jimmy was smaller and more fragile than the disguised man of steel so he went flying back a few feet after the bump. Sorry Jimmy Clark laughed and used his super strength to help Jimmy Olsen up off the ground. You know I need a new coffee cup now, thanks dick. Jimmy and CLark played like this a lot in the office so Clark was prepared. Ive got your coffee right here. Jimmy looked at CLarks closed fist. Ive got your headline right here! Jimmy pointed to his croutch.Well lets go make some cream. Jimmy and Clark ran through the office chasing each other and giggling. They stopped inside the copy room. Clark pulled off Jimmys pants and started to give him a normal hand job. Jimmy clung to the sides of the copy machine and laid back to accept the release that was about to come. Clark decided to use his powers a little bit and started giving Jimmy a super jerk. Jimmy couldnt contain it anymore and let loose. Clark used his super sucking powers to guide Jimmys cum in to his mouth and swallow with prestiege. Liten, Jimmy, what we do is fun. If Lois ever found out. Lois wont find out Clark, because Ill never tell. Clark smiled at Jimmy as a Charizard walked by the window behind him.

Oh my gosh Jimmy a Charizard! Jimmys relaxation was cut short when he looked out the window and saw the giant pokemon. What is it doing here!? yelled Jimmy in anticipation. Clark screamed for Jimmy to get out of the copy room. Get out of here Jimmy! You need to protect yourself! Jimmy was so turned on by the orange of Charizard that his boner came back. Im not going anywhere. I need a release Clark, now on your knees and suck or Ill tell Lois. Jimmy, I need you out of here! Now! Clark through Jimmy out of the copying room into the break room across the hall. I have to save Metropolis! Clark turned in to Superman and flew out the window to save the day. Batman was flying around Charizard in his Bat wing. Come on now! Were almost there okay!? Superman flew next to the bat wing and signaled for Bruce to roll down the window. What are you doing here, Bruce!? Im here to help out with the Pokemon tournament. This Charizard has just evolved and the trainer wasnt strong enough to survive it! Im guiding it back to the tournament and giving it to a more desrving trainer. What are Pokemon!? Shouted Superman as he avoided a building. Once he was withing shouting range again, Bruce told him. Pokemon are animals used to fight in battles. Kids from all over the world use them to fight in tournaments! Some pokemon come from Earth. Some come from outer space or were made in a factory.

Superman had a gleam in his eye. I dont like that look, Clark. Last time I saw it, Jason Todd was beat to death by the Joker. Dont you like jokes!? Asked Superman sarcastically. No. replied the man who fights the Joker on a weekly basis. Well, Bruce, suppose we coiuld win in this tournament. You could pose as a Pokemon trainer and I could be your Pokemon. Superman had this idea because the sight of Jimmy Olsen aroused at the Charizard was enough to make him aroused again; he knew Jimmy would tell Lois and Lois would get mad; Superman would have lost both his sexual partners and needed an outlet for release, the Pokemon would do just that. Bruce knew all this because he was the Worlds Greatest Detective. Youre just going to fuck the Pokemon arent you? Bruce fcused on getting the Charizard back to the tournament. I need friends who arent the worlds greatest detective, Superman laughed and landed at the tournament.

Bruce brought the Charizard back to the tournament. The tournament leader, Professor Oak, saw Batman and cheered. Hello! Batman! Have you come to fight in the Pokemon Tournament? Batman smiled, he reached in to his belt and pulled out a handful of poke balls. He threw one of the poke balls and Charizard. Superman gasped in astonishment. Wow! You dragged that Pokemon all the way through the city so you could tire it out and capture it! No whos the worlds greatest detective? Batman smiled and threw a poke ball at Superman. Superman shrunk into the poke ball. Prof Oak waved around excitedly. Great then, Batman! Your first oppoent is...Robin! Batman cried as he heard the news. Robin had been playing with Pokemon since he had collected him from when he was a boy. Batman knew he was up against evil. He went over to Robin to wish him luck.

Good luck Robin. You are going to need it. Robin sat in his chair in the locker room and smiled. How about you say it with a kiss? Batman kissed Robin and took off everything but his mask. Can I take the mask off this time? asked a boner ridden Robin. No! I hate your eyes. said Batman who was now wearing his utility belt nd cowl. What have you got in store for me tonight? Robin asked with a smile and a tear. Bend over...its a surprise. Robin bent over. Batman had been crafty in stringing them together. He took out the shrunken poke balls and started shoving them slowly into Robins tender hole. Pikachu said Batman as he put the poke balls deep in the Boy Wonders anus. Charizard, Robin bit his lip as his enjoyment increased. Ivysaud Robins anus puckered and he let out a whimper, not from enjoyment but from knowing he had a counter pokemon for every pokemon Bruce had. Squirtle. Robin couldnt help but throb his cock because Bruces Squirtle hadnt even evolved yet. Metapod. Robin couldnt contain himself anymore, his giant boy wonder spewed liquid all over the locker room floor. Superman. Bruce said as he shoved the last shrunken poke ball into Robins ass. I choose you. With a burst of light, Superman came out of his pokeball. There was no room for Superman inside of Robins anus so he kept growing until the Boy Wonder splattered into a million pieces of flesh,blood,bone and cum. Bruce picked up his poke balls. Superman Return. A confused and blood soaked Superman returned to his poke ball. And thats how you beat an opponent thats better than you. Batman grimmaced and smiled. He was one step closer to winning the Pokemon Tournament.

First up is Batman versus Robin! yelled Prof Oak. Batman approached the poekmon trainers pedastal to applause from the crowd. Robin was nowhere to be found. Th crowd waited for 5 minutes but couldnt find Robin anywhere. Robin has forfeited the tournament. Batman will now battle Brock! Brock took to the pokemon trainers pedestal. Brock sent out Onyx. Batman sent out Superman. To Brocks surprise, his Onyx was nothing for the Man of Steel. Superman quickly found Onyxs reproductive organs and went to town; the time he spent in the poke ball made him ridiculously horny. With a few quick pumps Superman was able to cum right through Onyxs body, creating a hole. After Onyx was reeling from the attack, Superman disintegrated him with heat vision. Brock began to cry like a little bitch. Superman returned to the oke ball and Batman grimaced and smiled. Next up was Misty.

Misty took her place at the pedestal and threw out Togapei. Batman used Superman. Superman took one look at that little egg creature and shoved him right up his ass. Then he flew into space. Batmn, using the shadows, snuck over to Misty and began to finger her. What is this feeling!? Im losing but I feel so good! MIstys gina juice ran down Batmans gloved hand and dripped off his spiked arm. When Misty was good and wet, Batman thrust himself into her, aided by the shadows so the corwd wouldnt see. It feels like Im evolving! Shouted Misty as Batman rammed his dick deep insde her. Superman returned to Earth with a suffocated Togepei. MIsty saw her dead pokemon and started crying while she was orgasming. Boo hoo uuuuuhhhh; boo hoooo uhhhhhh, fuck! Batman quickly finished as he had a tournament to attend to. MIsty was eliminated.

Wow! What an amazing turn f events! Yelled a flailing Prof Oak! Up next, tomorrow is Batman versus Our very own Ash Catchem! Stay tuned for all the poke action!

Batman went home and sat on the couch. He realized Superman needed to get home to Lois for a bit so he flew back to Metropolis and sat in Clark Kents apartment and waited for Lois to get home. Lois arrived with Jimmy Olsen following her. I dont care what you say, thats just not true you freak! Lois said hello to Batman, Can you belive this little creep is trying to tell me that Clark was giving him an HJ in the copying room. Bruce threw a poke ball out the window and whispered Superman, I choose you. Thats terrible! Ashamed Batman to Jimmy Olsen. But its true! And its not terrible! What Clark and I have is beautiful! And Clark came to the door with a depressed look on his face. I am the one who should be sorry. Ive been drinking coffee and thinking about everything that has been going on. Did you know that Batman is in charge of a pokemon tournament? 

CLARK! Everyone said as they saw Clark had entered the room! Jimmy says that he gets HJs from you in the copying room and that you threw him out; thats why Perry caught him jerking off in the break room. Lois doesnt believe me that its true. Clark, tell me its not true. Clark, tell her it is true! Batman grimaced and smiled. 

Its true. Clark said with a sad face as he finally finished his cup of coffee. JImmy and I are in love; but not the same kind of love that you and I are in Lois. I love both of you equally in different ways. Leave if you want, but I wont love you any less.Theres only one thing to do, Clark. Lois went over to Batman and started blowing him with an evil look in his eye. Clark cried. Jimmy Olsen, afriad of what to do, took out his orange furred dick and began swinging it in front of Clark. Party time. said Jimmy softly as Clark wept and got on his knees. Lois came over and joined Clark. Wow, babe! I can see why you like this! He tastes amazing! Like candy! They invited Batman to join in on the fun but he said, Im not into that gay shit. and went home. Jimmy Olsen bent Lois lane over the table and stuck it deep inside her. Clark was behind Jimmy and stuck it deep inside him. Batman, who everyone thought had gone home, used the shadows to sneak up on Clark and put it deep inside him. The train of cumming was so loud that the neighbors started to yell. Batman silenced them with sleeping gas and went back to the cum train. That night everyone slept like babies.

Batman stood on the pedestal looking at his greatest enemy yet. Lois and Jimmy were in the stands hugging each other. Ash Katchem looked at the Caped Crusader with an odd infatuation. Pikachu! I choose YOU! As said as his Pikchu jumped off his shoulders and into the battle field. Superman, go! As remembered that Superman was weak against a few things; the sun; kryptonite and lighting. Thundershock! And superman was hit harded than ever. But he didnt flinch. He took his fist and rammed it up Pikachus ass through his mouth. Ash sent out Blastoise and Superman did the same thing. Adorned with the bad choices of Ashs dead pokemon, Superman flew in front of the kid from Pallette town. I am your God. With that Superman froze Ash then began to Super-hump him into melting. Batman grimaced and smiled at the fun Superman was having. Superman had unfrozen Ash and was waiting for his next pokemon. Ash Katcherm chose Metapod. Superman swung metapod around and put him up his ass. Superman squeezed his buttcheelks and metapod fell into a million pieces of goo and shell. Ash cried as he was out of usable Pokemon.

The winner is Batman from Gotham City! Prof Oak cheered and presented Batman with a badge. The group went to the locker room to get away from eveyrhting.

Well that was quite a match! Said Lois. Yah, it was sure exciting! screamed Jimmy. Batman sat on a red spot on the floor. Superman sat in his lap. We make a good team! The Worlds Finest! And they l made out on where Robin died the night before.

Then End
