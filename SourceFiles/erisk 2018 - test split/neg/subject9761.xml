<TITLE> Word Count Web Sites? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-08 05:34:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm looking for a web site that publishes word counts. I don't know if anyone else does this, but I like to plan my reading in such a way that it'll be convenient for me to finish without being rushed because I want to get on to my next book.

Specifically, I'd like to know the word count of John Muirs "The Yosemite" as I'd like to read it on the plane out there. Should be 8 hours of airplane/airport time and I'd hope that would be enough to finish before I arrive. If not, I'll have to start before I go. I read at a rather leisurely 200 wpm but I make up for it with 80% comp!

Anyway, any help would be great. Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I forgot to follow up!

450F for 15 min got a nice brown crust on the top of the roast. lowered the temp to 325F for an hour. Checked the temp, it was 105F. Left it in for 45 more min, temp was 125F, I pulled it and let it rest under tinfoil for 15 min before cutting into it. It was a good medium color. Tasted great. Pretty tender. I was a little disappointed the herb garlic marinade didn't penetrate into the meat, especially after a full day of marinating, but the crust on this thing tastes fantastic.

I put both carrots and asparagus under the leg and although the carrots turned out perfectly, the asparagus was mostly mush. They didn't burn, probably because i covered them in olive oil, so they tasted decent, but the texture was awful.

8/10 would do again if it goes on sale. That's really the genius here. "organic" fancy brand boneless leg of lamb for $2/lb (maybe it was $3/lb?) so my 4.5 lb lamb dinner cost me like $10 including the veggies.

Thanks to everyone who helped me out. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Boneless Leg of Lamb Question </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-19 22:22:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello There!

I bought a 4.5 lbs boneless leg of lamb last week and was really struggling with figuring out how to cook it. At first I was going to just jam rosemary and garlic into it and cook it for a few hours. Then I found a recipe for a marinade and thought, "hey this might work!" So I've got the lamb still wrapped in netting, marinating in herb and garlic marinade for...like 24 hours now? I was going to put it in a baking dish and bake it for an hour at 450F. Thoughts? Will this work? Should I do something more complicated with it? My plan is to do a side of grilled asparagus.

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.

BTW: My broiler isn't working. I could grill it but that'd mean I've need to clean my small charcoal grill :(

<TEXT> Hey there! Looking for some advice on what bike to buy! Haven't really biked in 10 years but I figured this would be a good way to get around and stay in shape!

I don't plan on doing a lot of crazy rough terrain biking. Mostly neighborhood streets and maybe some trails. Some of the streets do have large potholes and they haven't been resurfaced in years. I'd also like to join some friends on a 18 mile, mostly city some country, ride in the fall.

After talking with a friend who biked to class everyday for about 2 years, it was suggested I find a road bike rather than a cruiser, mountain or hybrid bike. I have an opportunity to get a new schwinn high plains mountain bike for about 60% off (some assembly required). I looked at decent road bikes and they seem really expensive. I don't want to spend a lot of money because there is a 20% chance it'll get stolen in the next year. I do plan on buying a Ulock but you never know.

So my question is, do I go for the cheap mountain bike? If it turns out I hate it I can return it in 30 days. Will I be uncomfortable on it while riding? Is a road or hybrid bike worth it? 

Thanks for any and all comments, advice, concerns, questions, and wise remarks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in tokyo for the first time and a bunch of us went out for drinks. We went to, of all places, a british pub. After a few drinks I go outside for a cigarette and this large eastern european dude comes up to me and asked to bum a cig. We start talking, he seems like a nice guy, tells me he runs a club down the street and that me and my friends should come over for some free drinks. 

Sweet! I start texting my friends and they start to file out of the pub. Lastly was our guide, who obviously had drank a lot. He had been talking about how his wife was pretty strict and this was his only chance to let loose. Anyway, I introduce them all to my new European friend who now has a few more of his friends behind him. Our guide decides to be a dick, and right there on the street, insults the Europeans mom. 

I try to calm things down for a sec, then spit starts flying, then arms start going. I grab two dudes that I knew well in our group and book it down the street, grab a cab, and head to the hotel. We all think we dodged a bullet. Like possibly a real bullet. I did not want to die on the streets of tokyo.

I call our guide the next morning and try to figure out wtf happened. Why would he just randomly insult a guys mom? Turns out our guide knew what was actually happening. Turns out these "owners of clubs" trick tourists into coming to their places, give them a few drinks, and then essentially hold them hostage until they pay a shit ton for their "free" drinks. I didn't believe him, until I ran into the rest of our group that I dipped out on. They went with the guy to his club, and got fleeced for about $200 each for 1 drink. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was on a panel for a call center manager position where one of the most veteran agents was interviewing for the position. I knew this guy was great and knew his shit. I was so excited for him to be going for this job and I thought going in he would be a good fit. After all, he's been there for 15+ years. There must be improvements he could drive. Must have ideas on how to get the most out of younger agents. He was a top performer!

We started asking him the standard manager questions. What would be your management style? "I don't know." What changes would you make? "I don't know." How would you deal with *specific situation we just had to deal with*? "I'd have to be manager to know what i'd do." 

....ok.... So I toss him some softballs. 

Me: You've seen many managers come and go in this position. What have you learned about being a good manager?

Him: We've had some good managers and some bad managers. 
...and proceeds to rattle off all the characteristics of our bad managers over the years

Me(after like 10 minutes): So those are things you wouldn't do. What are some things you would do?

Him: I don't know. I'd have to be manager first but I wouldn't...continues to say bad things about his previous managers, and then begins to weep.

It was like I opened some vault of repressed memories. Through the crying he just kept going with how agents aren't treated fairly and managers abuse their power.

We stopped the interview. I got him some water. I told him this would be an opportunity to "right the wrongs" but he needs to give us something. He didn't get it and thanked us for the opportunity, went back to his desk, and continued to be the best agent we've ever had.

While this is the worst interview I've ever been a part of, I learned the valuable lesson that just because you're good at your job, you may not be good at running the show. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Would you say your Airbnb stay is pretty far from Yosemite? 

We're in Groveland. It's a town like 35 min out from the park, about an hour from yosemite valley? I don't know for sure, I've never been. I'm just going off google maps.

 Any hikes that are a must for morning or sunset for the best views?

I have been trying my hardest to find recommendations for this. 

I've been told anywhere in the Valley is great for either because the way sun hits the valley walls. I was thinking of trying to get out to Mirror lake for a sunset because I heard there are great views of Half Dome from there. I'd like to do Glacier point for sunrise one day since that's a great overview of the entire valley. But I'm inferring from what I've read in guidebooks and online, nothing specifically says "be here for sunset/sundown". I'm assuming since hetch hetchy is all about the falls there's nothing special about any given time of day. Though maybe watching the sun from the dam could be good? 

If you find anything out, please let me know!

<TEXT> I didn't know this was going to be on and just happened to be watching PBS when it started.

This. Was. Amazing.

The whole climate change aspect was not too heavy handed and they made many good points about how the glaciers melting formed the valley to begin with. 

The amazing videography (word?) left me breathless. They obviously used drones to capture footage from OVER THE SEQUOIAS. I've never wanted to climb anything but now I want to go scale el cap...TOMORROW(jk). And the little pikas...aww so cute. I couldn't get the video to load but I'm going to keep trying so I can watch this again and again...and again and again!

Question though, the firefalls they showed, was that this year(2017)? How new was this footage? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I too am headed to Yosemite in Mid-May!

At this point I am in a holding pattern for my planning. It is not clear if big oak flat road or glacier point road will be open by then. I've planned a full day of hikes in Hetch Hetchy since that seems to be the only park of the park that for sure will be easy to get to. I'm expecting wild temperature swings as other have posted so I plan on dressing in layers. Here is what I have for a day in Hetch Hetchy and I'll be posting my other 2 days once the road situation is more clear. We're novice hikers so I chose all "easy" hikes but I expect to still have a great time.

 Saturday May 20th - Hetch Hetchy

 6.5 hours of hiking in seldom visited Hetch Hetchy should afford some spectacular views of early-mid season waterfalls. If we are able to get to the Carlon Falls trailhead by 10am we can have lunch after the first hike. Or halfway through each of the first 2 hikes; both have good picnic areas. There isnt much in Hetch Hetchy, so we should plan on bringing food and water. Then we can decide if we want to do both Lookout Point and Wapama Falls, or choose one over the other. If we do both we could be done with Lookout Point by 2:30 and head to the Wapama Falls Trailhead by 3pm. Well need to be out of Hetch Hetchy by 9pm but we would back by 6pm.

 **Carlon Falls**

 - 35 min drive from the the cabin
 - 4 miles
 - 2 hours
 - Riverside meandering hike
 - 30-foot Falls
 - Good place to picnic

 **Lookout Point**

 - 20 min drive from Carlon Falls Trailhead
 - 2.8 miles
 - 1.5 hours
 - Great view of OSaughnessy and the Hetch Hetchy reservoir from a distance

 **Wapama Falls**

 - 20 min drive from Lookout Point Trailhead
 - 4.8 miles
 - 3 hours
 - Includes walk over OSaughnessy Dam
 - Most of the hike is along the Hetch Hetchy reservoir
 - 2 falls, Tueeulala and Wapama

Let me know what you think! Any feedback is welcome!
Also we're doing an AirBnB but there's 4 of us so the split cost ends up being less than a hotel. For 2 it might be worthwhile checking out the hotels/inns.

With the idea that it'll be cold and possibly some snow, can anyone recommend some good shoes/boots? I have an old pair of boots but when I used to hike in Boy Scouts I found a good pair of sneakers was much mor comfortable in. Suggestions? </TEXT>

I'm expecting it to be nice(70s?) in the day, cold at night(40s) and hopefully not too wet.

I figure we'll stick to the valley for the most part. I was hoping to do El Capitan, Half Dome, and maybe Glacier Point.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello Community!

I'm headed to Yosemite in May and would like to plan some hikes and activities. Anyone got any good advice on what we should see? Can anyone recommend a good guide book or two? It'll only be 4 days so we want to hit the must sees/dos but also any other hidden gems would be great. We won't be camping or doing any over night hikes. 

Thanks for any and all advice, information, or wise remarks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> My general rules about finding stuff the following:

1. Can you identify a true owner; meaning did you see someone drop it? Is there a name or other personally identifiable information on, or with, the item? If so, return it.
2. Can the owner identify the item; meaning if you were to turn it in, is it likely the true owner would be able to claim it via an unknown mark or initials or if it is a unique item.
3. Does it look like the item was left on purpose; meaning was the item found on the ground in relative disarray? or was it found placed on a post or leaning up against something like someone put it there? Basically, would someone come back looking for where they left it.

If there are no distinguishing marks, have no way of contacting the owner, and it looks like the item was accidentally dropped, misplaced, or discarded, I have no issue with keeping the item. If I think that the item is special or valuable, I may go out of my way to post a sign or ask around, but this is not required.

I use to work at a computer lab in college and people would leave shit behind all the time. At first I'd turn things into security and just be done with it. Then I found out that security was either taking things from their lost and found box, or just giving the items away to anyone. I started my own lost and found after that. This leads to my last rule about turning in items: make sure you get proof of the item being turned in. If someone comes looking for it you can prove where it went. I'd give receipts for items turned in. Imagine if someone left a flash drive somewhere with all of their school assignments for their entire school career and when they came back it was gone. Imagine you had found that item and turned it in thinking you did the right thing only to find out the person you turned it into was dishonest. Wouldn't you feel a little bad/responsible? I did, and that's why I do what I do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love me some gefilte fish. I've only had it jarred and am hoping some of my more jewish friends can bring me back some homemade from sedar this year.

I buy gefilte fish whenever it goes on sale. Luckily most stores don't really know the difference between the major jewish holidays so it's on sale for about a week in the fall(rosh and yom kippur), about a week in the winter(hanukah), and then obviously in the spring for pesach. It is surprisingly expensive for what is essentially ground fish. Not even salmon, it's white fish and carp I think.

I'd be curious to know if there is any other way to eat it besides plain and with a fuck ton of horse radish(red or white).

When I tell people how much I love it they always ask about the jelly. You don't eat the jelly. I mean some people like it but...that's where I cross the line.

Gefilte fish is essentially jewish SPAM. Or for more fancy folk, fish pt. I also like liverwurst and chopped liver. 
I want to see the merits of a gefilte fish based diet plan. I mean, it's fish right? So it can't be that bad for you? Maybe it's got a lot of salt?

<TEXT> I'd be curious to know how Ben Shapiro would respond to your situation and letter. I place the blame for the rift in your family, and many families, on far-right sensationalism.  Mr. Shapiro gets to speak from a place of comfort and normality. His children didn't have any issues from conception to birth. Congratulations. That should disqualify him from trying to influence the opinion of others. 
 You know how many abortions happen in the third trimester in America every year? It's 100. That's it. And ALL of them are from severe abnormalities, chromosomal defects, and 100% fatally dead children. All of them.

I'd like to see a source on this. Not because I don't believe it, but because I do think this is a more accurate representation of the world in which we live. I'm not sure of the motive behind such severe legislation when the positive impact would be so small, and the negative impact so large. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello All.

I finally have all the materials(I hope) for my magic mirror.
I'm planning on doing this with an old tv(LCD). I have the pi, the tv(35"), the flash card, and reflective film.  I'm not sure how I'm going to frame or mount it yet.

Can someone explain a)is there a reason my old tv would not work, and b)do I need plexiglass between the reflective film and the screen? Why not just put the film on the screen?

Also, I've done a ton of research and haven't found a great, step-by-step instruction guide. If anyone can link me some guides and links to the OS I should run(I have 2 that I found but I figure there might be a new one out there?)

Any and all help is welcomed and appreciated. Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Up until 14 I never would do my chores. When my parents would yell at me about not doing my chores I'd throw a temper tantrum. They tried to reason with me and said things like, "we pay for your food, clothes, and your shelter. The least you can do is clean your room and rake the leaves." So one day I was supposed to clean my room and rake the front yard. I did neither. My parents get pissed, I start yelling. It was around dinner time and suddenly there's no place setting for me. I double down and start yelling that I didn't want dinner anyway. Then my mom tells me to take off my clothes. After some hitting and yelling, I'm standing in the corner in my underwear. But of course I'm still sobbing and yelling at the top of my lungs. Then they tell me to get out of the house until I calm down. I'm mostly naked, it's a frosty northeastern autumn eve, and my mom is holding the door open for all the neighborhood to hear and see a 14 year old half naked kid yelling and screaming about room cleaning and leaf raking. I was outside for about 3 minutes before I calmed down. It was so damn cold. But holy shit did I ever learn my lesson. I can't imagine what the neighbors thought.

I did ask my mom about the episode a few years ago(about 20 years later). She did not remember. My older brother did, however, and said it was hilarious from his perspective. This was of course during a time when "child abuse" and "parenting" had some overlapping themes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Had a friend in high school that asked me to read her essay for her reach school, an expensive private college in the northeast US. She was from a Vietnamese family that owned a series of nail salons. She explained in her essay that sometimes to help ends meet she'd have to work in the salons after school. She went into meticulous detail about giving women pedicures, especially when they had nasty feet. 

I learned a lot that day. I also didn't eat much. At first I was disgusted. I had nightmares from how she described some of the old womens bunions, calluses and ingrown toenails. The smell, the texture, the sensitivity she described was just overwhelming. 

Then it hit me. I was only reading about it. She actually had to do it. All the time.

It was obvious she was a great writer, but I had to tell her that this may not get her into the school. She got in.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Somehow I think this story is relevant.
Back in the 50s my grandfather was finally making money as a physician. This was after school and serving as a stateside doc for 4 years during WWII, and then working at a hospital for vets for a few years after. He and my grandmother decided to extend their family as they only had one child, wanted to get to 4, and time was not on their side. Part of this dream was to sink a large amount of whatever money they had into a nice house. My grandfather found a plot of land about an acre in a philly suburb and hired a firm to build the house. Things were going well and they thought they had timed the birth of their second child such that the house would be done. My grandfather would swing by the construction site every day on his way home from his office to check on the progress himself. Sometimes he'd clean up after the workers a little. Sometimes he'd make notes and send them to the foreman. But the main goal was to make sure the house was built before that baby came out. So he'd hide beer around the site. Especially in areas that were ahead of schedule. I'm sure this violates some rules somewhere, and there may be some exaggeration, but apparently my grandmother gave birth 2 weeks early and the house was done 2 days prior to that.
What's my take? Treat people well and they'll give you what you want.

Turns out that deep conversation was her telling me she wanted to break up cause she didn't know what she wanted or something.

I've heard good things about the french place in EPCOT. Any advice? We won't have any fancy food passes or anything and I figure for one meal we'll go all out, so price may not matter too much.

Thanks!

EDIT: thanks for suggestions! I'll look into all of these. When I googled fancy restaurants at disney world Victoria and Albert's keeps popping up. Anyone been? Is it too off the beat path? Is it like $100 a plate? Is there secretly a better place and V A's is just a trap?

<TEXT> Not using turn signals.
It's not that hard to flip the switch. It is illegal to not use them. They help communicate better with the rest of the people on the road. Yet for some reason I can't go 10 minutes on the highway without seeing someone changing lanes without their signal. I don't care if there is no one else on the road, use the damn signal. It's the guy you don't see(and doesn't see you) that'll get ya. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can you cite a source on this? What I found in the link posted by u/zbucklyo was this:

 A landlord may use the SHST only if the **total amount paid during the year** for repairs, maintenance, improvements, and similar expenses for a building does not exceed the lesser of $10,000 or 2% of the unadjusted basis of the building.

Looks like it's cumulative. Unless I'm misunderstanding it. Which is very possible. </TEXT>

I looked up the Safe Harbor rule and I would qualify but I think I've spent too much(by about the cost of the water heater). But this is good to know. If I keep improvements below a certain threshold I can deduct it all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll be going to yankee stadium for the first time this year on the 1st. I bought 3 tickets on stubhub so they won't be available until 48 hours before the game. My plan is to bring my phone with the stubhub app but how do I use the other 2 tickets? Do I just pass my phone back through the gate? I'm sure someone has done this...

EDIT: Has anyone used a stubhub ticket THIS YEAR? The rules changed this season. As I understand it, no paper tickets are accepted. I wouldn't think stubhub would allow selling of digital tickets that couldn't be used. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Minor improvements and maintenance on a Live-in Rental Property </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-19 03:12:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello r/Tax!
I tried using the IRS site to help me clear this up but I'm hoping someone can provide a straightforward answer.
I currently live in a house that I rent the basement out to two tenants. 
This past year I've had the following expenses that I'm not sure if the count as "expenses" or if they "add value":

* Replacement Water Heater due to old one exploding(no damage) - $3200
* Put in a new driveway(not replaced, brand new), included replacing front concrete steps that were falling apart - $4900
* Roof exhaust vent/fan - $500
* Awning over back door/private entrance for tenants - $700
* Landscaping for both aesthetics and to help with drainage - $700
* Installation of storm door - $400

Some of these things could be seen as purely maintenance, some might add value to the house. But no single expense was over $5000. Can I expense it all? Do I need to depreciate the driveway or water heater?
While my tenants rent the basement, the whole house(kitchen, living room, laundry room) is shared. I'd say about a 3rd of the house is truly "mine" (my bedroom and my office). 
I also pay all utils(about $300/month) and $30 every other week for lawn care.
I have a full time job and I withhold the maximum amount so I've never owed money but obviously I'd like to expense as much as possible. This year I'll have brought in about $10,000 in rent. 

Little help? If I broke the rules, I'm sorry. I read them and think I'm in the clear?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was applying for grad school and there was a mix up at the admissions office. I had to call in to set up an appointment to come in(had to be done in person) and prove that I was in-state. I was already pissed, i had lived in the same state all my life and went(and graduated from a year prior) to the same school as an undergrad.

I called and left a message but the voicemail was hard to understand so I wasn't sure if I had left a message for the right person. I ended the message with something like, "oh and by the way I really hope this is *Ms. Whomever fixes this fuck-up* because I couldn't understand the voicemail. If you're going to have a voicemail you should make it clear who it is otherwise there could be mistakes made."
I got a call back telling me the time/date of my appointment and that the woman I was making an appointment with has a speech impediment.
Boy, did I feel bad when I showed up for that appointment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went in for a cutco interview once. It was weird that there were 20 or so people in this room when I got there. But hey, i needed a job. I thought they'd call us into the back for interviews, but then did a "group interview" which again, set off alarms. It was a presentation about the cutco product and company. I started asking questions and stopped taking notes on everything the presenter said. At various times throughout the interview she would ask people to leave or go into the office for an interview. It seemed like they tried making a competition out of it. If you were paying attention and taking notes, you got to go for an office interview. If you stop taking notes you're labeled as "not cutco material" and are asked to leave. The first few people who got kicked out were pretty dim. Asked really stupid questions. Then I asked about the commission and some other details. She looked at me dead in the eye and said, "I don't think you're cutco material. Please collect your things and leave." and I responded, in a stern and rather loud tone, "Thank you."   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember freshman year all the frats would invite us out for Rush events. Free food and booze. And sometimes they'd go all out. Shrimp, crab, imported beer, etc. Each time, after about 20 min of chilling and eating they'd launch into their pitch for the frat. We'd nod and then leave, on to the next Rush event. It felt like they wanted us to join a cult but we felt like we outsmarted them.

Somehow I felt this story was relevant to yours... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in Atlantic City about 10 years ago standing in line to cash in my $300 worth of chips after playing poker. I was with my family and they had been blowing up my phone about meeting them for dinner and I could tell they were pissed. The line for the cage was super long. Some guy came up to me in line and offered to buy my chips because he wanted to jump on a table. He handed me some bills, a couple of 50s and such. I hand him my rack of chips, he disappears in the crowd, and I head towards the buffet. As I'm walking I start to count the money. It's only $120. I start freaking out. I run back to the poker room and try to find the guy but asking for a short asian guy in a sea of people just gets you dirty looks.

I felt quite the fool. And I'll never not change out at the cage again. It could have been counterfeit for all I knew.

Also once I got kicked out of a group Cutco "interview" for asking too many questions. So I'm not all stupid. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello Frugal!
I recently got an offer from my gas company to have my rate locked in for the next year at 0.495 per Therm. The letter states that prices fluctuate throughout the year and this would protect me if prices went up. I've looked through my old bills for the past year and it looks like I never paid more that 0.479 per Therm on any given month. I'm inclined to decline but would love to hear some opinions on this.

Thanks, </TEXT>

<TEXT> Looking for any and all advice on planning a bachelor party for 5-10 people in Orlando for a long weekend. We're looking to have a good time on a budget($300ish/person not including airfare) and not do the standard "bachelor party" experience(we like our jiggling done on a roller coaster). I assumed staying in the park would be the most bang for the buck but I'm curious what others think. Should we do an Air BnB just outside the park? Should we focus on a specific park? Are there packages we should look out for? I'm hoping we can go mid to late january, hopefully it's not too late. I'm also hoping this isn't the first time anyone has done this. Someone must have planned a bachelor/bachelorette part at Disney at some point. Tips and tricks welcome!


Edit: $300/person sorry i wasn't clear. And I'm gonna bump it up to $500 cause estimating can be hard sometimes.

Thanks!

We haven't decided if we'll try out Universal. 
I assume we'll want to do more roller coaster stuff so we'll probably stick to the ark formerly known as MGM and Epcot.

Would it be smart to call Disney and see if they have suggestions? I always heard they rock at planning. </TEXT>

<TEXT> a)don't throw them in the toilet. Even the "flushable" ones will clog plumbing. I keep a plastic grocery bag to throw them in.

b)don't use them often. I try to keep it down to once a week on a fear of developing a rash. Through anecdotal evidence (3 or 4 friends) using them regularly will cause a rash even if you use the ones that say they won't.

Good Luck! </TEXT>

a) Just installed the app on my Win10 computer. The app launches but when I click the login using Facebook button, the facebook login comes up for like 2 secs then goes to "We can't connect to the service you need right now. Check your network connection or try this again later." Network connection is fine. But I don't have the facebook app installed on my comp. Thoughts?

b) I've been using the app on my windows phone 8.1 (I have a lumia 1020) for a few months. Although I am very selective and swipe right only 5% of the time, I've never matched with anyone. Could this be the app? If not its likely I'm just not good at tinder :/

About a week ago the scores just wouldn't load. I had connectivity and I tried on WiFi but nothing. So I logged out and tried to log back in. I clicked the log-in button and it goes to a white screen. I hit back and try again. Same thing. So I click the button that says Sign Up Later and it takes me right into the scores, no problem. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it and had the same issue. I've tried multiple times a day since then and still nothing. 

Anybody else experiencing this? I have a Lumia 1020 that unfortunately I can't upgrade past 8.1.

Thanks!

<TEXT> There's two subways near my campus, one on either side. One is run by cheap-o fucktards that won't honor subway specials and don't clean their bins. I've seen mold multiple times. They'll try to get away with skimping on meat and fixins. Once they burnt my sandwich in the oven and wouldn't make me a new one. I wasn't even a dick about it, was just like, "uh the bread is more black than brown and the cheese is all black". The response was, "well you wanted it toasted."

Then there's the good one run by a nice mom and pop indian couple. They are on point with everything. Everything is always fresh. They run the nationwide deals. If there's ever an issue they go way out of their way to rectify. Example: The self serve soda machine was out of lemonade. They refunded my combo and immediately replaced the lemonade in the machine so I could get some. I wouldn't let them refund my combo.

Needless to say, I only go to one subway now. But I'm under the impression Subways can differ from location to location. </TEXT>

I do keep the AC off pretty much every day when I'm at work 9am-5pm,  if I remember to flip the switch. This is when a web programmable thermostat would come in handy. </TEXT>

As a side note regarding replacing the bulbs, someone in my neighborhood replaced all of his bulbs with LEDs and gave away all of his CFLs for free. So now I have about 70 CFLs, most of which are still in the package. I should never need to buy light bulbs again! I know /r/frugal would love that story. </TEXT>

I looked into solar. Solar City said I'd have to have 2 massive trees removed, one of which isn't even on my property. :(

I'm going to investigate the household dryer usage. I may switch to a clothesline for the summer months. Thanks for the advice.

<TITLE> How to reduce my electric bill? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-08 22:27:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello r/frugal.

I was hoping to get some advice on reducing my electric bill. It's summertime(in the USA anyway) and I've got my air conditioner pumping so naturally my electric bill has sky rocketed. But even before that, my average bill and usage is almost double what the electric company deems as "standard."

It's a relatively small 4 br house with two people. The major energy users should be:

* 1 AC unit 
* 1 Refrigerator 
* 1 dishwasher
* 3 computers(average 400W PS)
* 2 TVs(45" and 55")
* 1 Microwave(I think it's a 1200W nuclear reactor)
* 1 toaster oven
* 1 Washing Machine
* 1 Dryer
* about 35 light fixtures, half of which have CFLs, the other half are on dimmers and need to be incandescent
* 2 Ceiling fans

I've got gas heat and stove, so that's not an issue. The electric company has an energy saving box attached to my AC unit which is supposed to make the fans cycle and keep the actual AC off on specific days of the year.

So far these are my ideas to help save money, but I'm not sure how much impact they will truly have:

* Programmable thermostat
* Attic exhaust vent(do these work?)

That's it. I'm probably going to go around the house and note how much wattage ever item in my house pulls and try to add them up and see if it's close to the 1300kW im using in a month. Is it possible there's a "leak"? Can an electrician do a power audit of sorts?

Any advice would be great.

Thanks.

<TEXT> When I was in middle school, 11-13, I started calling my friends cause now I was allowed to use the phone. What I didn't know was how collect calling worked. So, if I wanted to call my friend from the library, or the local pool, or wherever I happened to be, I'd use the pay phone and make a collect call.

One day, one of my friends parents called my house and left a very angry and loud message saying I need to stop calling them collect because it was costing them a lot of money. I deleted the message before my parents heard it but very slyly asked my parents to explain collect calling to me at dinner. They basically told me never to use it unless it was an emergency. A few years later enough people had cell phones that it wasn't an issue.

But yeah...collect calling...whoops. </TEXT>

I'm also looking at teaching online. Seems like an efficient use of time. I can "teach" 3 sections without leaving the house. I hate online education but if I can make a buck...why not? You're essentially a moderator of a forum(class participation) and then need to grade assignments which in many cases is done automatically. I haven't heard back but I hope to start this fall.

I have family that went for PhDs in the sciences. All but one regrets it. The one that landed a sweet Phama job. The others are stuck doing bench work as Post-Docs hoping they can publish and get out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know this isn't the norm, but the only time I called a mechanic a crook was when I went in for an oil change and when I came back three hours later all four wheels are off and I'm being told I need new brakes and they already started the work. While I have zero confidence when it comes to car maintenance, hence why I pay someone to change my oil, I'm not a moron and I know signs for when I need brakes. There was no screeching, or issue with stopping distance. I told the mechanic that heads up would have been nice, and that he really should have asked permission before he did something like that. I insisted he put everything back together, to which he bitched and moaned and said it would be unsafe for me to drive away in the condition the car was in. Saying things like "I'm not allowed to put it back," or "I won't be able to get it done until tomorrow," pissed me off even more. I gave him the $30 he wanted for the oil change, waited an hour+ for him to put the brakes and wheels on, drove right to another shop where they told me I had at least 4000 miles left on my brakes. He also told me that the oil filter wasn't new. And now I go to that guy for everything and have for 3 years. 

All I want is a person I can trust and rely on. I don't care if it costs me a little more. The problem is, when you do run into a crook, what are you going to do about it? They know how to get you into an uncomfortable position. I can call the BBB or tell everyone I know but I'd rather put up a billboard over the highway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was on the desk(the service desk) we'd get calls like this all the time. BUT there was one guy who started calling in every morning at about 7:55am because he couldn't log in. I used to help him when I was a Desktop tech(I went from Desktop Tech to Senior Tech at the Desk) so we knew each other and I almost was delighted to get his call every morning. Started me off right. After about...a yearish of this going on he started getting really irritated and seemed to forget who he was talking to. He would say things like, "I never used to have this problem," followed by, "there's a guy that always fixes this for me." I never really thought anything of it. At some point, we get a resignation notice for him. We all notice it and have sentiments of sadness since our favorite inside joke would be gone soon. He was retiring at 76 after 35 or so years with the company.

Two days after he retired, at like 2:30 in the afternoon, we get a call. It's him. And he wants to reset his password. This time his account has been disabled. He had left the firm. We weren't sure what to do exactly. 
We had been trained to never tell someone they had been removed the the company. Someone calls in and we've termed them, we tell them to go talk to their supervisor. We say nothing about the disabled account, or that we got notice from HR to remove their rights.

So, armed with this training, we tell the guy, "you need to go talk to your supervisor." He hangs up, frustrated. We all think it's weird but we all have other work to do. We noted he called form his office, but how did he get in there? He must have turned in his badge upon his retirement. How did he get in the building even? He'd have to go through security who gets the same HR termination notices we do.

I call a desktop tech to go check on him and to swing by his supervisors office on his way. I later hear through the tech and a buddy in security about what happened:

Desktop tech and the supervisor show up. The supervisor asks him what he's doing there. He days he's trying to log into his computer. He notices the desktop tech and saying something to the order of "good thing you're here this fucking thing never works right." After some discussion, Security gets called. He is physically removed from the building and his wife is called.

Luckily this guy couldn't find his car in the parking lot before she showed up. Turns out he had dementia. Some days were better than others. This was a bad day.

I know, long story. But I'll never forget what happened and just remind myself when I have a frustrating call, maybe they have dementia and it's not my fault.

<TEXT> That does it.
I love the hardware and was really looking forward to Windows 10.
But the lack of apps, poor integration, MS insistence on doing nothing to actually promote the platform... My next phone will be an android. 

Something silly happened today. I got an ad for MileIQ from MS in my email. And it advertised that it was supported by iphone and android. Not Windows Mobile. Why. WHY?! I don't even care about the app but Why would MS send out an ad for an app that doesn't work on their platform. Maybe they should develop it for Windows and then advertise it? Or even say "coming soon to  windows phone"?

It's just sad. The phones have been a problem. The Surface, which had amazing potential, is, in my opinion a failure (I shouldn't have to spend an obscene amount of money to get the model that actually works), Windows 10 isn't terrible but they discontinued support for many good features and apps, the wearable which had potential turns out to be garbage. 

Come on Microsoft. I spent the last 5 years as a fan boy mainly with the hope that in the end, it would all work out. I just don't believe it any more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello All,

I was wondering if anyone has any advice regarding upgrading to Windows 10 Mobile. 

I have a Lumia 1020 running 8.1.

I updated a few months ago and it wrecked havoc on my phone. I found out that since I had chosen to be on the "slow" track I got a bad version.

What version will definitely work? How do I make sure I get that version? Will all of my contacts, texts, apps, pictures, etc., still be there?

I liked many of the features of Windows 10 once I got it working and would like to give it another try.

Thanks in advance for any and all advice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the reply.

I won't be upgrading again anytime soon. At this point I've seen it and will just wait until the full roll out, March I think? I'm pretty happy with WP8.1. I also don't want to do another hard reset. It takes like 3 hours to download all my apps and texts and contacts etc. 

I did find this article published yesterday though:
http://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-may-have-just-fixed-stuck-app-updates-windows-10-mobile-store

So, that's some good news. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello r/windowsphone!

I've been a windows phone user for some time now. Ever since the Lumia 900 came out anyway. I've been very happy with the hardware and the OS has been pretty good. I argue that it's better than the Android I am forced to lug around for work, but there are google features and apps that work better on Android. But I digress.

I recently took the plunge to try out the Windows 10 preview. A friend at work got a 950 and tried the WP10 preview and it just worked great. He has no issues and loves it. I have a 1020 and did not have the same experience. Generally, I liked it. Features missing from WP8.1 that are in WP10 are great. I fully understand and anticipate GREAT things when full WP10 rolls out and integrates with Windows 10. I love the look and feel of WP10. But I ran into a nice long list of issues:

**Email didn't work**

* Although I could see that my google accounts were there I couldn't access them. Apparently this is a known issue.
* I couldn't add a new email account either, I think this is related to the same issue.

**Apps**

* Many apps just disappeared. I saw this with my upgrade to Windows 10. All I want is a list of programs that didn't transfer so I can find a replacement. Instead, I had to stumble upon what apps were missing.
* Why did Cortana disappear? Why did some apps transfer fine while others I needed to re-download? 
* At some point all of my apps were inaccessible. The Apps list was blank. But all my apps on the start screen worked fine, so I know they were installed. This was the final straw to roll back. 

**Crashes**

* Oh My Gawd. The OS crashed daily. Certain apps, like MS weather, would crash the OS every time.
* Certain apps would randomly crash themselves.

**Phone stopped working**

* After the initial set up, and after I kinda got things going, the phone stopped working. I couldn't make or receive calls or texts or connect to WiFi. I could navigate through the phone, but otherwise it was a brick. I did a hard reset and had to start again and re-download and re-set up EVERYTHING.

**Bug reporter**

* This is a preview, I get it, it probably shouldn't work perfectly. But what SHOULD work is the bug reporter. I would have LOVED to report all the issues I had so they don't happen in March. But every time I tried to report something the OS crashed. 

If you've made it this far, thanks! 

My advice to anyone thinking of trying out the Windows 10 Preview is, back-up EVERYTHING. I forgot to back up some photos I hadn't synced to OneDrive yet and after the inevitable hard reset, I lost them. Not a big deal, it was like 4 pictures, but I forgot about them. Another redditor suggested making sure you have a back-up phone. Luckily, I have my work phone so I wasn't without phone and text for a weekend before I got the phone part working again.

Now for the issue, which I more curious if anyone else has this issue. I rolled back. Had to log back into everything and set up a few apps, re-download almost everything. But now I have 5 blank apps that won't download. Instead of the app name, it just says "Downloading Application" and the subtext is "attention required." I click the "try again" button and the same thing happens again. There's also no image for the app. So, is there any way to figure out what these apps are? Is there a way to force the download? Is it possible these are apps that downloaded on WP10 but now don't work on WP8.1?

Thanks for reading. Remember, there are dozens of us, DOZENS! </TEXT>

<TEXT> In middle school one of my best friends found out I was jewish and started being super weird and standoffish. At some point he called me a "fucking Kike." I was shocked. Someone I had been close with, eaten at his house, played on the same baseball team, etc. That was the end of "us" and I never talked with him again. I think he's in jail now.

Looking at some of the other stories here I guess it wasn't the worst thing in the world. But at 14 I was floored. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Chassis.

I had done a huge report on different types of cars in middle school. We had to also do a presentation but all the research I had done was via books and owners manuals. I got up in front of the class and proceeded to speak very intelligently about all sorts of car stuff. And I was really getting into cars and stuff too, like I wanted to be a "car guy." Then, after class, the teacher told me "great report, but it's "Chas-ee", not "Chass-Is". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Abraham and the Idol Shop. Not sure if it's in the Bible or just the commentary.

Basically, Abraham, as a boy is working in an idol shop. His father leaves the shop and tells Abraham he is in charge while he's gone. A woman comes in and wants to pray to the idols. Abraham then smashes all the idols and put the hammer he used in the hands of the largest idol. When his dad comes back and asks what happened, Abraham tells him the idols got into a fight and the largest one won. His dad is pissed but realizes that this must mean that idols are not gods and therefore there must be only one god that is not an idol. Or something like that.

This story was told to me when I was in hebrew school before I was a Bar Mitzvah. I think the idea was "prove" that worshiping idols was dumb because it makes no sense to put faith in an inanimate object. I think it just made me question my faith even more. I remember asking my hebrew school teacher how is this any different than putting the torah in the ark or worshiping "the one true god" just because we're told to. I didn't last long in hebrew school... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had the same problem with a 925. Everything worked fine until I plugged in some headphones and then the phone never figured out that I had unplugged them even after I had. I sent it back through AT T and was sent a replacement. Immediately upon putting in headphones it happened again. I did some research and found this was a "known issue" and that it should only happen to a small fraction of the phones. But since it happened to me twice on two different phones I asked for a different model. They sent me a 1020, which has not had any problems.

So I'd suggest contacting your provider or Nokia to see if they'll replace it. I think it is a defect with the hardware they use in the jack which is failing to dis-engage the headphone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In middle school/High school we had 2 Sex-Ed classes, one in 7th, one in 10th. They were pretty comprehensive and did a good job of making the scary parts scary (STDs, pregnency, etc.) and the rest prettyy informative. I always hoped one day after we'd learned everything there was to know they would pair us off and we'd get to all have sex with each other, right there in class. Like some sort of practical exam. It only made sense to try it out after learning all the hypotheticals. 

Then I found out in the 10th grade class that half of the school was supposedly sexually active and had plenty of practice.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Two Stories:One where I'm the bad roommate, the other where I'm not.

Story One:
Freshman year of college my roommate and I were not friends but we didn't have any problems with eachother. I was a lazy bastard that hung out in the room and went to a few parties and came back drunk, while he triple majored and ran track. The worst thing he ever did was about once a week yell out directions to his house while he was asleep. One day, I thought he was going to be a track practice all afternoon and I figured it would be a good time for a wank. I had forgotten that the day before he specifically said that he was bringing his girlfriend over and asked that I make myself scarce. So, in he walks, with his girl, expecting me to be gone and instead I'm sitting there with headphones on watching terrible porn with my dick in my hand. Whoops. He was pissed. Super pissed. I hid in the library for the next 3 days. Later he said it wasn't a big deal but that I should stop jerkin' off so often. 

TLDR: I was a dick, with my dick.

Story Two:
I was in a suite with 6 other dudes. Most of us were at least acquaintances but in order to get this suite we needed to take in a random person. We had seen this guy at a few parties so we at least knew people that knew him. 
Turns out he was a raging alcoholic, that did an insane amount of coke, and would pick up non-english speaking people at bars and bring them back to the suite to have what sounded like loud painful sex. At first we thought he was gay because the second night we were there he brought back some hispanic dude that we recognized as a busboy from one of the local restaurants. No biggie. But then he brought back a girl the next night, then the next weekend 2 more dudes, and this went on throughout the semester. Once we threw a party and got a keg and we were about halfway through it one night and he shows up at about 1am with a cohort of dudes and gals that looked like they just fell off a Juggalo wagon. By 3am the rest of us were done but they were just getting started with lines of coke and drinking from the keg which he/they did not contribute to. Whatever, people are crazy.

One weekend towards the end of the semester we realized we hadn't seen him in about 5 days, but we were pretty sure he was still in his room because we'd hear Slayer blasting at random times of day/night and banging on the walls. Suddenly, at about 3pm on Sunday, 8 dudes and 1 girl come flowing out of his room and walk past us in the main room like its no big deal. The rest of us look at each other like...um wtf just happened? Then on of the dudes asks me if he can "borrow" my tv to watch a football game. In April. And this was not a flat screen, it was an old box tv that easily weighed 200lbs. I told him no and after a few "c'mons" I just said please leave and he calmly walked out. The roommate then comes out, half naked and looks like he just woke up from a 100 year sleep. We asked what was up with that and he didn't respond, turned and went back to his room. When we had to move out we went into his room and found piles of used condoms and random food containers, but nothing else besides the university owned furniture. 

TLDR: Pretty sure random roommate had coke binging orgies in our suite on the regular, and never invited any of us. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would like some advice building a custom draft/auction. Ideally there would be an draft component AND an auction component, but one or the other would be good enough.
Basically, it's like a fantasy football draft but with completely customization inputs such as players and point values. I'd like to run it live online for some friends and I. No real money would be exchanged, it would be for fake points and bragging rights. Any suggestions? I have limited technical knowledge but am tech savvy enough to potentially understand any jargon you may need to use. Any and all ideas are appreciated, thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He was a doctor, internist I think but I don't remember. From the stories I've heard there was a "doctors" magazine, like surgeons monthly or american medical digest weekly or something, that had some high quality prints in every issue. They were collected over many many years and at some point he decided to make the collage. He and my grandmother were great appreciators of art but never had the money to really own anything too unique. They put their money into their children's education and occasionally splurged on some really radical furniture. Keep in mind this was the 50s/60s so nothing too crazy, but some of my fondest memories from my childhood are sitting at the teak table in the kitchen looking up at this amazing wall of amazing works while sharing some late night ice cream with my grandfather.

Thanks for pointing out the proper use of "classical" , "classic" , and "canonical." I'm learnding! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello r/arthistory! I have come to you for some help identifying what I understand are many "classical" pieces that are part of a collage my grandfather did in his kitchen. At this point the house has been destroyed but my fondest memory of his house was the kitchen and how the wall was decorated. I would like to reproduce it. Both for nostalgia and just to see if I can. So, I have an album of all of the pictures I took of the wall before the house was torn down. I would really appreciate any and all help identifying the pieces. Please just tell me what picture and in what area of the picture the piece you are identifying is. I wanted to make this its own post, and I still might, just to get attention. Obviously, the more eyes on this the more likely we can ID the whole thing.

<TITLE> Looking for a Windows 8 Tablet </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-04-24 02:54:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Any help would be lovely.
I'm looking for a windows 8 tablet that's got more than 1 full size USB port, and a full size HDMI out port on the tablet, not with a keyboard. 64GB+ drive with expandable SD would be great. I would like to be able to hook up a keyboard as well but I won't be using the keyboard a lot thus I need USB ports for peripherals, and I think I'd like to use a bluetooth keyboard. I will be hooking it up to external displays so screen size doesn't matter.
I played with the Surface and did not like it so I'm looking for a different manufacturer.

I have searched and searched and found tablets with some but not all of my specifications. Please help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TIL "Burghoff's left hand is withered and misshapen with the fingers being very shortno cause is known for it, though it is presumed to be a birth defect known as a localized dysmelia. In M*A*S*H, he is often seen carrying a clipboard or other object to conceal the defect, though there are scenes where it can be seen very well, especially in the pilot episode of M*A*S*H*."

<TEXT> Super Smash Bros. has amazing replay value. I've been playing for 10 years with all sorts of people through the years. Unfortunately, its the  multiplier that makes the game, so without friends it gets old. Goldeneye is an amazing game but Perfect Dark is like Goldeneye Plus. If you want single player I'd go with Super Mario 64 and Ocarina of Time. I also enjoyed Conkers:Bad Fur Day. It's a little rude but I was 15 when I started playing it.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Best Remote Desktop Tool? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-08-21 08:21:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've looked around for a MS developed RDP tool for my Nokia Lumia 900. I figured Windows 7 and WP7.5 should work well together and with the upcoming releases of Windows 8 and WP8 there would be something good AND free in the marketplace. There is a Remote Desktop App that cost about $15, but I don't want to drop money on an App that sucks.
Advice? </TEXT>
