<TEXT> So far, I feel that playing a geokineticist is my biggest offense to date.

"What do you mean you have DR 7/Adamantine?"

"What do you mean you have a climb speed on stone?"

"What do you mean you have about 50% more hp than the party?"

"What do you mean you do 1.5 * 4d6+15 damage?" 

"What do you mean you do that from 120' away as long as you don't move?"

"What do you mean you have 25% resistance to critical hits and sneak attacks?"

"How many dice are you rolling for that crit??"

I wish the crit range wasn't so awful, but it makes it all the sweeter when a 20 comes up, and with a +14 to hit I can confirm pretty easily unless it was nearly impossible already.

I already have a ring of sustenance, and I'm planning to grab a iridescent spindle ioun stone and a wayfinder to remove the need to breathe, meaning that with 1 round of notice I can live the rest of my life as a potato once I grab Earth Glide at L10 and Tremor Sense at L12. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on the setting, but I'd like to see more vertical exploration. More stuff to do in the sky or below ground rather than just a wider map.

Caves and twisty mazes in a coral reef at the bottom of shallow part of the sea, a truly deep trench with an Argonian city in the inky black depths, floating islands in the sky, a shanty town in the canopy of a forest, airships cutting through the skies. Steep cliff cities that are very narrow but have multiple terraces of height, a crumbling dwemer ruin suspended over a massive void. Mines that crawl ever deeper into the ground, caves that go on for miles with dead ends, places that are too narrow for most to pass and have underwater portions, and even things like a massive tree that has an entire settlement inside it's hollowed trunk.

A return of Acrobatics and Climb ( all this vertical stuff is going to demand climbing and basic parkour stuff like climbing surfaces, mounting, and swinging ), and especially flight spells to take advantage of the open air. Teleportation magic would be useful as well, but between fast travel and flight, not really required.

I'm not sure it'd really work - current AI pathing is pretty awful and I don't think it could handle having to deal with flying and swimming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure if sarcasm, but as with all lore given the nature of Dragon Breaks, it is open for interpretation:

Formatting spoilers is a mess, so [check this](http://pastebin.com/Bc14mHfX) for my reasoning.

In the end, it is mostly speculation and will probably require TES6 lore to figure out what really went down. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do it like Pathfinder Society traits. During chargen, they get to pick 2 backgrounds of different types.

They'd amount to being minor bonuses - +5 hp here, +7 magicka there, +3 block, etc that would serve more to provide flavor to the character without making it wildly powerful - there's not a massive difference between 25 and 30 for most skills in terms of long-term benefit ( and before legendary was introduced, actually would *lower your max level* ), but it lets you play as a Khajit who is slightly better at using his claws in combat, an Orc who is in great shape and has higher than normal health, an Argonian that is good at using a shield and conjuring weapons to fight with, a Nord comes from a line of Speakers and has stronger than usual Thu'um, or a particularly superstitious Breton who has slight magic resistance ( stacking a magic and religion trait to get it ).

In the grand scheme, a half-way decent enchanting score would make most if not all of these useless unless you do "flat-or-percentile-whichever-is-more" scripted stuff, so I don't feel any bonus would be too strong as long as it is kept at 10 or lower. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on the setting, mood, and tone the game shoots for, honestly.

I could really dig a [Southern Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Gothic) [Black Marsh](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Marsh), where the Big Bad is a hoodoo ( Voodoo is a religion, Hoodoo is folk magic ) user trapped in a polygon of manipulation between a few of the Daedric princes ( Vaermina, Boethiah, Clavicus Vile, etc ), and some sort of lovecraftian elder horror, each side trying to play the main actors in the plot against each other for its own gain, similar to how [Alduin manipulated the Imperial and Stormcloaks into a war to gain souls](#spoiler "Skyrim").

The player would get press-ganged into clearing a ruin of some sort, but gets separated from the rest of the group by a cave in of some sort, where they witness the Big Bad arrive. After a spirited conversation with the rest of the people, where they refuse to give him what he is asking for, he unleashes a hoodoo curse that kills them all. He then notices the player, trapped in the small room they are in, and tells them to "walk free, go to city name and tell others what you saw - to not disobey me." Another curse is then used, and the floor collapses under the player, dropping them into a cellar or cave, and prompted to escape, in typical TES tutorial form, into a grotto in the bay, where they are cut loose to do what they want, with an objective to go to the city named, which would branch them out to the factions they can join.

tl;dr

Point Lookout with swords. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Slightly harder than you'd think. Most brands of juice and juice cocktails will be watered down and sweetened with HFCS or CS unless you stick with 100% juice ones. Breakfast cereals, yogurt, salad dressings, most baked goods including the "healthy" brands, and the obvious confections ( although a sweet syrup of some kind is essential ) and sodas.

Since baked goods contain it, anything that contains those tend to have it as well, like instant stuffing, ketchup, **cough syrups**, pickles, baked beans, applesauce, some luncheon meats, steak or bbq sauce, soups - it just goes on and on.

It's easy to avoid in the same way that it is easy to be vegan or gluten free - it is pretty much a lifestyle change, not just a brand change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the "traps" to be aware of - a lot of super low budget devices run on ARM processors ( like in a cellphone or cheap tablet ) instead of x86 processors, meaning that you won't be able to natively run things compiled for the other architecture - you'd be waiting for an ARM-compiled version of the game, like an Android port. This could be worked around by acquiring an emulator like QEMU or ExaGear that runs as an x86 virtual machine, but you're going to end up with a subpar experience.

There's the ExaGear RPGs freemium app, as an example, that is capable of running Diablo II: LoD after some setup work for audio, but pretty much all the games you can use it with require special patching or to be directly supported.

You'd be constrained by the memory and power of the device itself, and the experience could be greatly impacted by having a sub-par graphics device for more modern games.

For your money investment, you're FAR better off buying a 300 to 400 dollar mid-range laptop. Your options and mileage will vary by region and preferred vendor, but something similar in specs to the HP 15-ba079dx would be a decent starting point for the general purpose laptop - in both specs and price. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on the use and construction. If the purpose of the sauce is to add moisture to a dry steak, or flavor one that is very bland, then you are correct - you are masking a mistake.

On the other hand, there's valid use cases - sometimes, I just want a strong sauce to pair with a not strongly seasoned steak. Other times, a sauce built from the drippings of the steak, with a little butter for body and maybe even flour to make it a gravy, can be incredible and is part of the recipe on fancier things - consider [steak au Poivre](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/steak-au-poivre-recipe.html). </TEXT>

<TEXT> XNA games default Game.IsFixedTimeStep to True, which forces Update and Draw to be called with an interval of Game.TargetElapsedTime, which defaults to 1 / 60.

There's likely more involved than just sticking a slider in that changes the value, and unclamping that value would be disaster if everything is tied to that refresh rate, but you'd likely have to recompile the game to change it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What if JoJaMart is just a front for the Ferngill Republic's military and they want to build a base / supply depot with sea access, given that Stardew Valley is a seaport on the Gem Sea?

The population of the valley wouldn't provide nearly enough revenue for a large grocer to survive, even if you count travel from the highway as that is incidental at best, and not anywhere near enough for the equivalent of a Super Walmart.

Consider Project Greek Island during the 50's - the US government financed the building of an entire new wing in the Greenbriar resort as a cover for their congressional bomb shelter. It isn't a stretch to think that something similar could be going on here - the community center is really too small to be a distribution point for Joja.

I know Joja is painted as the bad guy because Morris is a huge douche, but he could also just be a war profiteer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Apart from woodcutting, foraging has little value late-game. You could make 1 item each season more rare   valuable. You could make 1 item each season more rare   valuable.

Winter sort of already has this going on - Crystal Fruit is intensely valuable for a forage item ( 150g base ), which makes it excellent wine fodder - it has a higher value than Strawberries, Blueberries, Cranberries, and Grapes. Only Melons, Ancient Fruit, and Starfruit outperform them.

Spring and Fall have this with with Salmonberries and Blackberries - only a few days to harvest all you can, and you can then churn out an obscene amount of Jelly with them since they're useless for Wine, as good as Blackberry Wine sounds.

Spring and Fall also have Morels ( Spring, 150g base ) and Chanterelles ( Fall, 160g base ) in the Secret Woods, but Summer overall is lacking - with the main thing of note being the Fiddlehead Ferns at 90g base.

Granted, to make these a stable income you farm them yourself from the season appropriate wild seeds ( minus mushrooms and ferns since they aren't included ), which mostly defeats the purpose of foraging in the first place. </TEXT>
