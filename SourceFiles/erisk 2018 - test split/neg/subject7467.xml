<TEXT> The Dutch speak English fluently because their TV and cinemas  isn't always synchronized so they watch a lot of American shows. Nothing to do with education.

In France they teach us English very early and throughout the whole educational process. But our TV and cinemas are all fully translated to French, therefore we don't use English on a daily base.  

Same goes for Spain, Germany and Italia by the way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys,

I'm from Europe I just moved in a house in Adelaide (Unley) and I'm trying to find out which kind of internet should I get?

I  looked up many websites and ISP providers but jeeez its such a mess,  ADSL, ADSL +2, FTTN , HFC, NBN..  it was much more simple in EU so I'm lost.

I was planning on getting NBN HFC 100/40 from internode but its pretty expensive ($99 monthly) and I 've read that its kind of like gambling, some have a good speed, others dont.


I'm a gamer and I play mostly online games so I d like something kinda reliable without having to sell a kidney.

What would you recommend ? 
Also, I'm in a house that has TV/phone cables ( they look the same in France so I assume it is that), if I would apply for NBN HFC, will they need to make nees holes in the house or it would just go through existing cables ?

Thanks! ( beside that mess, i love your country I hope  to become a true Aussie citizen one day) </TEXT>

Weird thing is, after being banned and muted from talking to the mods, I can now go to the sub and post again. I won't though. Tired of being steamrolled. By the the way, one of the rule is : "no rascim". Lmao the first answer I got was "some cultures are better than others" and "African culture sucks compare to European one"

<TEXT> Hey mates,

My gf and I just moved from Amsterdam to Adelaide and we are starting to look for jobs.

As a Pastry Chef from France with a proper work ethic, I won't be happy making low quality food, so before I massively apply in every hospitality business I see, do you guys know a good brekkie place or a good restaurant that works with fresh products?

I hate pre made crap and industrial food, do you know any place I should avoid applying so I don't waste my (and their) time ?

Thanking you in advance, Adelaidians!

<TEXT> Because it is not true ?

The DLC gets a higher rating not the core game.

Why do fanboys dont see they get milked by all those dlc ? Day 1 dlc ?! Seriously how can you defend them ?  They had everything ready but nooo you got to pre order or pay more to get Chaos, which is the core story line of the game. They knew every Warhammer fan would like to play Chaos.

Its like a football game that would put Real Madrid or PSG in a DLC. 

Its a great game and they know they can sell us more things since people like you are defending their dirty marketing strategy.

So the blood and gore dlc would have got higher ratings. Not the core game. Go ahead downvote me all you can, but I'm still right it was just a lame excuse.

<TEXT> No they are right to be proud of giving stuff for free.
I love their games, but they should feel ashamed of selling their games in pieces. The Chaos should have been in the vanilla game, as well as blood and gore. It's a war game, but blood has to be bought separately... 

Like you get DOOM but you gotta pay more to get graphic violence ? Nah ! 

The elfs and beastmen, ok I understand it's a lot of work and optional for players. 

The rest is just greed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When they get close nobushi can go into hidden stance and kick them quick. Then GB GB and light one for bleeding.  

But yeah I feel you yesterday I got destroyed by a warden prestige 3 about 4times. His way was to constantly push and get close while bashing and light fast attacks. He would block and parry everything. Hidden stance would result in a fast attack.

Its hard to handle hidden stance and it drains lots of stamina. Oh and when the beserker do one heavy attack successfully and takes away half of your HP, I really wonder why people are saying nobushi is OP.

SO true. I had it yesterday again, it was so annoying to respawn and get ganked per 3-4 guys in a few seconds, rinse and repeat 5times I was surprised to see none of my team mate ragequit.

They should make people respawn is an unattainable position so the loosing team would have a chance to regroup there instead of dying one after each others </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah for sure most people wouldn't want it, war in Europe is not even thinkable today, as it was created specially for that purpose. I really don't want to see a war in EU and I too love the open borders, I would even like to have a stronger EU, with countries working together to make the best for the Union and not trying to get the best interest for themselves.



It's more like a cold war right now IMO, obviously led by Russia that actually wish to expand back to USSR size. Expanding already their political dominance in the USA and they are the one supporting Le pen in France who is against the EU. I guess they wish to see the fall of the EU.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Drug trafficking is huge I'm France. Just weed business is worth about 1 billion per year so yeah imagine drug dealers in the guetto are like supermarkets. They have money to get weapons and hire lots of desesperate young folks that see more benefits in crime than in school. Probably because the first one allows them to get a better wage than the teacher.

We swim in our own shit. Fucking hypocrisy everywhere. You get rekt with wine and you are a patriot. You get stoned with weed you are a drug addict.

Gun ban ? Nah more like a gun control. My father owns several rifles and pistols he just needed a license with background and medical check. He needs to go training at the shooting range a certain amount of times a year to keep the license. And he cannot carry the weapon without having it locked in a box. </TEXT>

Marseille is the city of problems right now, police is struggling to maintain order against guetto guys armed with AK 47 and uzi..

<TEXT>  So by your argument, we are already at the stage of cooking dieing out

Unfortunately it is not going on the right way in some countries, it's all about education, at school but most importantly at home, if the parents are cooking and teach their kid what is good/bad it will not die that fast. Thanks to all the Slow-food people in the world, trying to counter the attack of the industry. I know it's hard because we have to work a lot, life is getting very busy and time is lacking for many of us.

The problem is when I see my generation, like I was watching Twitch and those 4 American guys could not agree more on the fact that cooking sucks because you spend 1h in the kitchen for 10min of eating, so they just order and get food outside everyday... I was shocked. I hope they are not representatives of the American youth but I think they are, correct me if I'm wrong I am not from USA.

Picture this generation having kids, microwave food everyday... if no one teach the kids how to cook and show them why it is better for one's health and better taste wise, they will never know.

I have an example, my girlfriend in from Holland and she always hated pastry/sweet food. She met me, a French Pastry chef,  I couldn't believe she did not like it, I made stuff for her, she always loved it and she was surprised how different it is from what she had experienced before. She likes it now, when she gets the good stuff made with love.

Because sweet food in Holland sucks, they use so much processed food and ingredients. Even in a 5 stars hotel I worked, the "homemade" muffins for the breakfast were made with:

Water

Muffin powder

GMO soy oil


I quit this place after 2 months because this was just insulting for my diplomas. 

We could indeed teach them, I would love to have a robot to help me and teach him the good way, a very smart one like in IRobot. But then it's almost a Human being !

 Already we're pushing the boundaries of food science. Transglutaminase to bind together random protiens? Hot ice cream? Deep fried tequila?

This is like molecular restaurants, it's a new pretty innovative way of cooking but it stays very marginal, it had an impact on all the modern restaurants that picked up ideas to serve new things.
But to be honest, would people give up the classic nicely chimney roasted T-Bone for a foamy fancy shiny emulsion of a T-Bone, just because it looks cool, nah. At least not in Europe.

About the deep fried Tequila soaked dough things, I would expect the alcohol to evaporate white frying... maybe is it because the Tequila is water based and it get stuck in the dough surrounded by the oil.

<TEXT> There is too sides, the Dark side (industrial food, GMO, all junk food,all cheap food) is destroying our most precious good which is food. They destroy it by making people dependent on Take Away and other delivery food, "Dont cook, just eat" is the ad of a huge delivery food company in europe. If you don't make it yourself, you have no idea where it comes from, no idea how they made it.

Don't think, just open you mouth and eat is their goal so when they totally control the food system (Bayer-Monsanto...) money and huge power will come. 

Who controls food controls everything.


And there is the Light side, independent BIO food producers that respect their goods (especially cattle) , independent quality restaurants (I say quality because there is tons of shit ones working with the Dark side for profits), passionate chefs and of course everyone that at least try to eat less shit food so they don't sign up for it and encourage that crap to spread everywhere.


Microwave are a good help to melt/warm up things, but in real kitchens there is none because you don't need them, it is useful at home but not necessary. I have seen once a documentary in Paris where there was a kitchen with 8 microwaves, 2 Nigerians and hips and processed food already made, ready to warm up and serve to tourist and people who don't know what real food is. It made me so sad to see how some cunts have no shame to sell poor quality food (in the name of the French cuisine) to people. It is not respectful.

<TEXT> Yes you are right. But I am a Chef, and I can assure you that cooking relies on robot a lot currently, since we have to cook big quantities, so kitchen Aid and mixer, intelligent oven, gadgets that make our professional life easier and improve the Cuisine in several ways.

However, a good chef needs his 5 senses working full time and accurately, cooking isnt just add this and this and fucking bake it, there is love involved, skills, experience.  Sure a robot can do something one way and the same way for ever and ever but will never improve anything, you know why ?

Robots don't eat food.

The day robots are actually eating food and enjoying it, then yeah, I am screwed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't what you mean by fluffy dough, real pizza dough isn't really fluffy. It must be light and crispy though.

Here is the recipe of REAL pizza dough ( not Domino's kind of dough)

500gr flour
10g salt
4Gr fresh yeast
250ml lukewarm water

There is no oil/sugar in pizza dough.

Mix water and yeast.

Mix flour and salt.

Put flour mix in water mix.

Work it until it's all incorporated.

Let rest 10 min with something to cover the bowl so it doesn't dry.

Work it by hand for 10 sec (8 pushes)

Let rest 10min. cover it!

Repeat those 2 steps 2 more times.

Now that your worked the dough 3 times it should be looking nice.

Let rest 24h at room temperature.

Now you can spread it and make a pizza. You can make up to 5 pizzas with that recipe.

Don't forget to let the pizza rest with the ingredients on top for 10min before you bake it. Oven must be as warm as possible. Real pizza oven are at 350 degres Celsius.

Good luck and enjoy ! 

EDIT: you can spread olive oil on the baking paper before you cook it. </TEXT>

USA started the drug war first, EU followed, USA is starting to legalize weed, what is the EU doing ? Nothing. And they still can find some people to go on TV to brainwash people on how 'weed is evil" , how it makes you step to harder drugs, how it makes people crazy...  Unbelievable in 2017, especially in France where the laws are the toughest in the whole EU, yet France is the country that smokes the most.

<TEXT> I cannot let you say that this is a French cheesecake.

Charlotte is the nickname of the basic cake. The one OP made could be called a "entremet facon charlotte" since its not a basic one but much more upgraded!

And it doesn't contain cheese. And not crispy cookies, those ones are soggy, dipped into a syrup, usually with Rum.

We do not have cheesecake in France at all.We have so much better. I ve never seen a real one until I went to Australia and the Netherlands.

EDIT: It remembers me while working in a Aussie restaurant, I made a "Fraisier", classic French summer cake, so good, so pretty, so complex in taste.It takes 2 days to make a good one. 
My Aussie boss saw it and was like "Oh mate nice strawberry cheesecake"

<TEXT> Yeah I know, personally I have to scale everyday dozens of ingredients. To measure in ml I need a measured cup that as to be big enough so I dont have to do it in several times and have to add up numbers. Lost of time otherwise.

Also it's a lost of time to wash the measured cup every time you have to measure something different. Scaling is just the fastest and the easiest way, therefore its the way to go for professionals.

There is this great recipe book from Thomas Keller (Bouchon Bakery). He's American but with French training, he explained why cups are unreliable, especially with big quantities, imagine when one as to measure 3kilos of something with cups xD

    I really encourage you to do your own research

Im trying. That's why I come to /r/The_Donald, I'm trying to understand your point of view without filters. I know about propaganda, it's scary to think that propaganda was already elaborated back then, it means that today, with all the technological advancement acquired throughout the century, propaganda is probably more elaborated that we can even think of.

I get info from a private French channel (TMC) owned by TF1 which is owned by Bouygues, therefore owned by the 1%. I can't trust them entirely.

I get info from Le Canard Enchaine too, newspaper owned by the journalists writing it and above all, ad free. I trust them 99% as they have been around for 100years and always managed to get the info that will stir up the political shit so hard that it gets often to court, they always win. Because they can actually prove that what they write is true facts only. I think they are leftist (BC extreme right/right/center hate them so much) but its hard to say since they attack every political party.

I read the English BBC, but yeah that s just the narrative as you call it.

To finish I get the rest myself from whatever comes. I love reddit for that, I can go to other subreddits with different opinion to and to /r/The_Donald in a few clicks to see how different opinions react to the same fact (true or fake).

With all of that plus documentaries I try to understand. It's not easy but very interesting. America has such a huge influence on the EU that even though Trump isnt my president, I can't just ignore it like most do over here "because tired of bad news".

I answer them "Put your head in a hole, go ahead, you will get fucked without knowing anything. It's called a rape. Personally I prefer to know so I can GTFO before"

    Stop sensationalizing shit.

I didn't want to, that is just the first thing coming to my mind when I see a Muslim supporting Trump. It just doesn't make sense, or OP is ultra moderate Muslim patriot like he eats bacon and drink beers, or he is blind. How many Muslim in Trump administration ?

In France we have a huge cultural problem with Muslim and its natural if they don't change their habits we surely won't change ours. I wish I had a Muslim friend, I mean I had good relationship with some of them but a real friend, nope.

Impossible as he would be bored as hell with us, alcohol, drugs and girls don't really match with the Coran. Same goes with wine, our famous butter and ham sandwich and so many other traditional french dishes. So we live apart, in the same country. If I go to some Muslim dominant country, I will have to respect their rules and tradition, even if I do that, I will never be completely integrated if I keep spreading my foreign culture everywhere I go.

That's why Le Pen-the-bitch is so high in the polls, because they are still not integrated even though its been like what, third generation now! Although many of them are, because they gave up on their religion like I did.

All of that to say, I don't understand OP, a French Muslim supporting Le Pen would mean he is not a Muslim anymore, but Atheist. OP proudly wrote he is Muslim.

EDIT: had to post again coz I linked subreddits that where not from the Trumpire... so I ve made a mistake, this isnt a place to debate, screaming I LOVE TRUMP is allowed. OK.

EDIT2: Sorry, just learned about "Brigading", reddit can be a nasty place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You re so right. Moreover Hitler went through WW1 as a soldier. Who knows what he saw and lived in the trenches. Not looking for excuses as what he did is inexcusable but that probably didn't help him do to "the right thing" 

I believe we are all born neutral. Education and life experiences  are the factors that make us different. 


 Knowing that millions of human beings are born and live in unstable or undeveloped countries still today doesn't make me believe in a brighter future... </TEXT>

The fact is that chocolate / cheese making isn't just for Switzerland. So many cheeses in France compare to tiny switzerland. Even the Dutch are making more cheese than Switzerland. And Belgium chocolate is world famous thanks to Congo. In fact in Europe the Swiss are more known for their richness and their neutrality than their food.  So you want your ham rich and peaceful right ? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You didnt see this post ? 

Alright :)

Any sugar dough will do for the crust, but I tend to use crusts with almond powder in it. Taste good.

 

Lemon Cream: _220g sugar _4 eggs _3 Lemons (bio is better as you ll need the skin) _300g Butter

First, cut the butter in cubes and let it warm up to room temperature and boil some water in a pot big enough so you can put a heatproof bowl on it but small enough so the bowl is not in contact with the water.

 

Then put the sugar and the zests of 2 lemons (3 if you like it stronger) with the eggs in a bowl that can support heat (84degree Celsius) and mix them with a whisk.

Put this bowl on your boiling water pot and whip well until the mix becomes foamy/creamy, no liquid should remain. Ideally, if you have a thermometer, you have to whip until it reaches 84c.This step is a nice free workout for your arms :) Note that you can do this step simply using a pot, but you ll need to be very careful to whip well and control the heat if you dont want to end up with sweet lemon scrambled eggs.

 

Once it is cooked pass it through a thin strainer to remove the zests and eventual lumps of cooked egg.

Let it cool down to 50/60 degrees C. and add the butter cubes by cubes while mixing with a blender, let the air come in the cream during this step, its better for the creamyness !

Done, let it rest in the fridge for 4h.

 

For the Meringue:

150g egg whites 300g sugar

I advise you to make a Swiss meringue, more easy and best result to be burn with blowtorch.

Mix the whites and the sugar in a pot on slow fire until the sugar is completely incorporated. Use your finger to check, it must be slimy and warmer than you but not too warm or you ll cook the eggs.

Mix it with an electrical mixer with whisk on until its thick and shiny. If you re not ready to pipe it, let it in the mixer at slow speed. If you stop whipping it will become hard and dry.

Pipe it the way you like, I recommend training on a plate before as you can re use the meringue anyway. Then burn it with a blowtorch!

Enjoy !

<TEXT> Kitchen guy here, Pastry to be precise. I'm disgusted how tips are shared in some restaurants. Example: I make 3.5k netto and 50 of tips per month. I have 10 years of experience and have been to school for it. A bartender working in the pub next to me makes 3.3k netto + 1k tips. So he gets 4.3k including 1k tax free for serving coffees and beers. I could learn his job in a day. He couldn't do what I do in months of training. Yet he earns 800 more than me. 

I already resigned and I can't wait to start my own business. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I ve never heard that ganache recipe needed bitterness ingredients.

 Usually coffee (please not instant it's not great quality wise. Better make an expresso with real coffee) is added to chocolate mousse or moelleux to enhance the chocolate taste and add strongest to it but personally I d prefer get a higher cocoa pourcentage by using stronger chocolate or cocoa paste. 

I like to add salt sometimes to chocolate ganache to balance the sweetness though. The hazelnuts s bitterness is needed in the whole pastry because nothing else is bitter in it.  Try the ganache at home it's so easy. 500 ml boiling cream poured in 3 times on 350g milk chocolate 30% mini. Let rest 1 night. Then you whip it until it's creamy. Done ! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you ! Yes I have to cut it in half to insert the crispy praline, usually in cubes or rectangles, its chunky. I could pipe it if I would warm up the crispy praline,but it's more work everyday, and I cut it in half for the aesthetic as well.

Cutting it in half allows you to insert whatever you like and get more volume. I do it with strawberries or raspberries like this one:[eclair framb.jpg](https://postimg.org/image/y8y1zih09/)

This raspberry eclair was baked with a crunchy layer that makes it looks different by the way.

Oh and for your question to pipe inside a 10cm eclair usually two holes on the bottom (flat side)  ==x====x== are enough if the pate a choux rose correctly. Otherwise a third hole in the middle bottom can help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for your compliments! 

The hazelnuts on top are not candied to avoid too much sweetness, just roasted to enhance their taste and grossly peeled so some skin remain on them. It adds bitterness. Note that the chocolate whipped ganache is only 1 liter of cream and 700g of milk chocolate 38% cocoa. No sugar added. 
The sweetest thing in here is the crispy pralin which is made of butter, milk chocolate, pralin hazelnut, pure hazelnut paste,salt, crushed roasted hazelnuts and paillet feuillantine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was part of the 31st december menu, it was around 250euros for 4 courses and a cup of champagne. It was on a panoramic tower so they paid the view as well. And the New Year Eve event..

But if it would be for the "a la carte" menu it would probably be sold around 18euros yeah </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the restaurant I used to work in France they would cover the salmon of sea salt and whole red and black pepper berries and let it rest in the fridge 24h before smoking it in a smoker for a few hours. I cant remember exactly I'm in pastry...

How do you guys smoking it in the oven ? Do you put some wood in the bottom ? I wish I could smoke my salmon at home  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lol yeah but its already so hard to create new pastries nowadays, giving them a name that will sound good to everyone and describe a little the pastry is even harder. 

Those guys just give simple easy names:
Cronut was easy:Croissant+Donut
Churroduo well its just two churros together so the name says just what it is.

In France we had a meringue pastry covered in chocolate sprinkles in a ball shape. We used to call it "Tete de negre" which literally means "Nigger's head". 
Thanks it was changed a few years ago for obvious reasons...but all those decades with this racist name in every pastry shop of France makes me shameful of being French.

This tarte tatin looks awesome by the way, I wonder how much do they sell it for. </TEXT>
