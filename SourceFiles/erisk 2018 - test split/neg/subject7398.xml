<TEXT> Its all a fucking sham the WSJ created to stab at youtube. There are some videos that show the journalist who published the articles photoshopped images of ads onto the videos that came out almost a year ago. Those videos never made any ad revenue because youtube cited the racist titles and removed ads. One dead give away was the view count that did not change between different ads. How can multiple ads play to the same viewer on one viewing? Doesn't work that way on youtube. Nice try WSJ. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OP here. Thanks for all the rad comments! Here some info about the pizza in the pic. The sauce was made with fresh ingredients from my garden, tomatoes, basil, garlic. I buy wheat dough premade and then let it proof for an afternoon or so. Only like using my hands on the dough and I only use a little corn meal, no flour for prep which I do on the peel. For baking I set the oven to 550 with a stone on the bottom rack. Shovel that puppy in there and leave it for 7-9 minutes. Fresh parm on top when it comes out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ninth or tenth for me. Been going since the beginning..missed a few years here and there. I recommend coming in as early as possible if you have GA camping passes. You will have to take a shuttle from the parking area to the front entrance. Then you have to carry ALL of your things to your spot of choosing. (Sometimes you can catch a ride on the festy shuttles) The woods fill up fast and you are gonna want that shade. Cooler checks are standard so hide your booze. The festival is an amazing, magical place filled with wonderful people at one of the best locations in my opinion. The lineup is killer this year, you will not regret this festival. There are showers too, hit em early or super late if you don't wanna sit in line. If you forget anything vendors and general stores gotcha covered. Hope you are excited it's gonna be here soon!!!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is no potential damage to the engine as it was designed to be removed and installed this way. If the technician knows what they are doing it comes out and goes back in with ease. In my opinion there is more potential error doing the job without removing the engine. Also, the benefit of removing the engine means you can closely inspect everything else while the engine is out. It literally takes about 90 minutes to remove the engine. Leaving it in to perform engine work is senseless, as I stated before, Porsche engineered it to be done this way.

Edit: Champions don't take shortcuts

<TEXT> It's not so much a mileage issue. More failures are due to long oil change intervals coupled with spirited driving. Here's a little more info: The zero-lash adjusters operate on a very small sliding clearance. The zero lash mechanism has a close enough fit that even when dry with no oil film at all the zero lash adjuster will hold air when squeezed together by the fingers.

If the any part of the valve lifter or valve assembly is hammered (damaged) this suggests the oil pressure to the lifters was insufficient and the zero lash adjusters were unable to keep the lash at zero or near zero and the cam lobe striking the lifter with some clearance acted in some ways like a hammer.

For the oil pressure to be insufficient doesn't require outright failure of the baffling. It may have been that some less than fully defoamed oil (oil with some residual air in it) was ingested by the pump and this aerated oil allowed the zero lash adjusters to partially collapse.

This defoamed oil can arise from too low an oil level, the wrong oil, or oil that is past its change by date. In this case the oil has become contaminated with combustion byproducts, unburned fuel and water to name two, and foams more readily because of it. There is a limit to how effective the defoam pots are and using the wrong oil or running the oil level too low or running oil for too long may deliver oil that exceeds the pots' ability to remove sufficient air from the oil. </TEXT>

The dealer should be giving you a copy of your repair order every time you have work performed to the vehicle. Have them print out the service history for the vehicle. 

Third:
It is a BMW. The ultimate driving machine that requires ultimate maintenance. It was made in Germany. When your parts are not in stock in the country it takes 5-7 days on average to get them to the dealer.

<TEXT> Soak your chunks of wood for at least a few hours. Good chunks will last for the majority of the smoke. I smoke in my UDS around 225F. After 6-8 hours I wrap my brisket in paper. Although, this is not necessary it does preserve some moisture. About 50-60 minutes per pound is a good rule of thumb for gauging how long your smoke will be. Be patient and leave it alone until you wrap or take it off. Good luck!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Start using a smoking device with water. The water cools the smoke and filters out some of the tars. It will be easier on your lungs. When the last hit sucks through it just goes into the water and not your throat. Just remember to always change your water, because no one likes old  stale dirty bong water. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For all you that think this is wrong you are sadly mistaken. Cooking a steak this way sears it instantly and cooks to a perfect medium rare. When using lump hardwood coals nothing sticks to the steak. It is delicious and I recommend trying it before you knock it. You will be amazed. Don't be scared.

<TEXT> Try and test drive a few with different options if possible. It will give you a better understanding of differences between options. Like OP said, smaller wheels = better ride, the sidewall of the tire is larger and can absorb more of the bumps/etc in the road.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The turbo models were made in limited runs and became blue chip investments for those who could afford them. Just over 2800 first generation turbos were built. Small production numbers, racing heritage, and the car itself being impossible to replicate all contribute to the collectors price point. The Porsche turbo is the epitome of a supercar. It is "the super car". It redefined what a super car/sports car was when it first debuted and still defines it today.

<TEXT> In fourth grade class one day our teacher stepped out. A guy and girl chased each other around the classroom until the girl ended up in a small closet. The  girl then held the door from opening while the guy pulled on it. It was a vicious tug of war for no more than a second. Then all of a sudden a horrifying scream and a bloody severed finger on the floor. The guy had got the door open part way and let go when the girl pulled back. Her finger slipped into the door jam and snip...gone bitch.
