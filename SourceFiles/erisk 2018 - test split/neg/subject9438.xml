<TEXT> What is wrong with that? Founding fathers were truly great minds. They foresaw so much things. For example if people had guns in Europe, Breivik would just kill one or two people... if a criminal wants a weapon he will get it anyway. Look at France for example, they had one of the heavily regulated laws on gun control and nothing stopped a muslim terrorist to shoot and policemen with kalashnikovs </TEXT>

<TEXT> Macron is a centrist in French spectrum. 

He is a former member of Socialist Party. 

He is a progressive globalist who loathes conservatism. 

He doesn't recognize Islam as violent religion, his quote: No religion is a problem in France today,. 

Wants to cut corporate tax to from 33% to 25% and wants to put sanctions on countries like Poland or Ireland. 

All in all France will get 5 years of same old shit and no real change. They have 10% unemployment and his policies probably won't solve that. And of course terrorist attacks will continue. 

As for me I am not very hyped because I wanted Fillon to win but oh well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our founding fathers knew that democracy doesn't work. 

"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world's greatest civilizations has been 200 years. These nations have progressed through this sequence: "From bondage to spiritual faith; From spiritual faith to great courage; From courage to liberty; From liberty to abundance; From abundance to selfishness; From selfishness to apathy; From apathy to dependence; From dependence back into bondage."

EU is somewhere between abundance and selfishness and it will ultimately fail, probably during our lifetime </TEXT>

<TEXT> I stand with the facts. Here is a quote from Emory website: 
"All Undocumented Students (with or without DACA) who are admitted as first-year, first-degree-seeking undergraduate students, who have graduated from a U.S. high school, and who are determined by Emory to have financial need, will be awarded Emory financial aid funds to assist them in meeting their demonstrated need."

And who is this undocumented student?

"Undocumented students are **illegal alien** school-aged immigrants who entered the United States without inspection or overstayed their visas illegally"

<TEXT> So tell me why he is a good choice? Did you see recent news? He wants to interfere in Ireland's tax code to raise corporate tax which will lead to possible crash of the economy. How can smaller country like Ireland compete with France or Germany? They are not on level playing field so having the same rules for both economies will destroy the smaller one. Macron is stupid if he thinks that all countries have to maintain the same ratios of employment, welfare payments, medical care, luxury taxes, road taxes etc, work weeks, holidays etc.
Ask yourself why he wants that? It boils to the fact that one of bigger neighbours dislikes smaller countires because they are unable or unwilling to compete. </TEXT>

Couple of days ago this article was upvoted to /r/all: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/691z4x/woman_found_guilty_and_faces_year_in_jail_for/. Title of this article is stating a factually untrue statement and its inherently poor quality because its a lie. Objectively speaking this article is founded upon lies that is contradicted by the truth. Actually, title is debunked within the article itself! Here is a quote "She did not get convicted for laughing. It was her actions as she was being asked to leave, the foreperson said. We did not agree that she should have been removed for laughing.. 

I can find you a ton of other articles that have loaded title that are false and make to /r/all very frequently.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> NYC is blue because leftie policies work best when population density is high because you can use all public infrastructure you are funding with your taxes. People in red states vote R because they don't want to throw their tax money away for public hospitals and not use them because simply there aren't a lot of them. I think it's pretty common knowledge and saying they vote R because they are backwards shit holes is very offending and inaccurate to say at least.

<TEXT> This is clickbait. An actual quote from the article:
However, the foreman of the jury that convicted her insisted to the Huffington Post that Fairoozs crime wasnt the giggles, but rather how she conducted herself when being taken out of the hearing.
She did not get convicted for laughing. It was her actions as she was being asked to leave, the foreperson said. We did not agree that she should have been removed for laughing.

If you disrupt a confirmation hearing with an unplanned protest, you're going to be arrested.
And she could face up to a year in prison.

Damn dudes, stop with the outrage over fake loaded title </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've read an article about poverty in USA. It stated that we are spending one trillion dollars on anti-poverty measures and yet 40 million people live in poverty. Also this quote made me think: "By that measure, the War on Poverty has been a huge failure. Despite $24 trillion in anti-poverty spending, self-sufficiency has not improved in 45 years". That just shows in practice that Reagan was right. Welfare and handouts make people lazy. That made me into a conservative.  </TEXT>

Again: "Properly done, single-insurance health reform could boost all segments of the U.S. economy, saving as much as $1 trillion annually in overall health spending, based on the experience of other countries whose health expenditures are almost half as much as that of the U.S. Businesses, state and local governments, and families would all realize savings." - what countries, how did you get that figure of 1 trillion.

That kind of governing leads to finding best solutions, at least I think so. For example if one side wants to regulate anything and other wants to regulate nothing, it will lead to best case of regulations, where some things are heavily under federal government and others are left to people. </TEXT>
