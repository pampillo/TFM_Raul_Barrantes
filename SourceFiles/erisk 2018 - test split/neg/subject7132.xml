<TEXT> You and I agree on a lot of issues. Yeah, I perused your history. And yeah, I relate to your anger and cynicism. On this, I will just say to please consider taking a position of advocacy on this one. This is such a great example of progress by way of civility, healthy dialogue, and discovering common ground. There is a very realistic chance that this consensus building will transcend the current administration's official stance on climate change, and result in passage of real legislation to thwart - or at least attempt to mitigate - this looming calamity.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Precisely. Against the backdrop of a government so divided (and corrupt) it is important to acknowledge examples of traction. Here, Republicans are choosing to participate in solving this problem. It is true that they are in many cases only participating as a result of accepting that there is an economic benefit, but it is nonetheless bridge building, and the economic benefit is real and valid, and high ranking Republican support erodes the base of right wingers who are hunkered down with Priutt and the fossil fuel industry.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Outsourcing to overseas book keepers: question </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-04 21:03:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'd love some advice. We are an American payroll, HR and insurance company. We are adding bookkeeping as one of our client services. I'd like to outsource some of the book keeping to Central or South America. I will set them up on US phone numbers and on our corporate emails. We use Philippinos for assistance with spreadsheeting, and have for years (As an aside, I've got great experience if anyone wants help in this regard). Im looking to Central / S America for this because I want common / similar time zone and bilingual Spanish is a plus. 

Thanks for any help. Again, any questions on Philippinos I can answer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hope you pursue every avenue for state assistance, as it's made a world of difference for my friends in MA, who have twins on the spectrum, one of whom is full-on. If you are not in a state with such assistance, it may be worth considering a move. If either of you have a capable family network, it may be worth considering a move to be very near them. Autism support groups can help you with emotional support and with finding other support resources, financial and otherwise. 

My friends both work (she works part time), reside in a state (and city) with support and resources, and they have family support. 

You are a strong and smart person. You're not as alone as you may think, and your stress and inner turmoil seem totally reasonable as you face this head on. It's great that your primary focus has been getting the job done, baptism by fire, and now it's time to take stock of just how you can find the balance long term.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is exactly what happened. I actually know one of the guys - a nuclear engineer - that inspected the seals and laser monitors as an IAEA representative; back then, he would periodically fly over, suit up, and dive down into the water. I was with him when GW's remarks ruined the fragile balance that had been achieved, resulting in a cancelation of his ongoing inspections. It was truly a diplomatic blunder of epic proportions, by an administration that was too obtuse to even realize its folly.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hope you feel better. I know you're down about not attaining certain things, but just want to point out something: you are exceedingly introspective. Introspection is a wellspring for many talents, and those few that possess your level of introspection often don't realize this because they are consumed by their self criticism. 

Talent is inner energy turned outward, in a positive fashion. Some examples of upsides to introspective personality types are empathy, discernment, groundedness, dark humor, and a knack for writing. 

I hope you can foster an understanding of, and appreciation for, the upsides to your internal monologue of self awareness, self criticism and self analysis. Those upsides are your talents. And for all I know they may be just a few of the many. But for sure, they are very real and significant. Find them, and channel some of that significant internal energy outward and into them. If you practice this stuff enough you will find your balance. And that's the goal. Because balance is really what happiness is, you know? Staying true to yourself, listening to yourself, learning your nature, and also connecting outwardly, positively, to others, and sharing your gifts....Balance. 

As an aside...and you probably know this, but just in case: Introspection - like depression, and like good grammar, and like good writing - is also a mark of above average intelligence.

<TEXT> Well, at least you have r/opieandandanthony upvoting you for referring to blacks as negros, hating blacks, marginalizing women (physically and mentally), jeering the mentally handicapped, etc., ad nauseum. It would seem that you're stuck in two worlds: one, where you think of yourself as a man of reason and fine temperament, awash in a a tsunami of media bias and liberal intolerance, and two where you are quite content as a bully, a bigot, a womanizer and a racist amongst others of your ilk. 

Your problem is not r/politics. Your problem is that you are conflicted. A part of you wants and seeks validation from nice people.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll float a theory: He's enjoying his remaining days as a free man. Even if he walks, he's knows the future is grim. He is going to be an outcast. Treason is like the Scarlett Letter. So, he golfs. He rants. He continues to go to his one move: to double down. 

We have all been asking ourselves how in hell is he able to win. Now it appears to be the case he's 'winning' because he's 'protected' by Russian mob money and influence. Tit for tat, however, and he's almost exceeded his usefulness. They know we know. He knows we know. I think his sole remaining ambition is to golf and plunder until he inevitably goes out in cuffs. It's less the golfing and more the plundering I'm worried about.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> ^ Sums up aptly, imo. I was initially hesitant to post and later quite tempted to delete (upon criticism, anticipated and warranted). 

I'll add that my general disposition is that r/politics is better served by articles that are way less fringe than this. 

Still not entirely sure why I posted it, but also still not deleting it. The conclusions within the piece are, well, bereft of evidence. However, I see value in the way the author introduces and arranges the data. A shame he presents his conclusions as facts, rather than asking open questions for his readers to ponder.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I concur. The title gave me a laugh. Although unfamiliar with the source, clearly dubious. I clicked, guiltily, expecting 1-paragraph clickbait drivel, but instead encountered an interesting read. 

As an avid follower of the ongoing investigation of  Trump, I see some nuggets in this piece - but, to be clear, the nuggets should have been presented at face value for the reader to think on, not as prerequisites to then leap into broad and dramatic conclusions. 

It's absolutely nuts for anyone to walk away from this piece with anything more than that takeaway. That's the problem with conspiracy fans positing as real journalists: they sometimes do great digging but then they let their imaginations marry the story, rather than simply presenting their research, asking open ended questions, and continuing the hunt for answers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! This post cited a show that aired this last Friday, and the topic is Trump. Not sure, but thinking this post may have been removed because of the reference to the 1930's as, at one point, Tim Snyder says, "we are in the 1930's", but it this is only because he's citing how history is repeating itself. Wil you perhaps give this a second look in case it can be restored? Either way, thanks! V </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lots of valid points here. You're likely right - and if pressed to wager on the outcome of all this, I'd wager he's going down and that we will build a stronger Democracy as a result of the burgeoning activism this has fostered, and with the benefit of hindsight. 

Chance favors the prepared mind. So, in the pragmatic spirit of hoping for the best while also planning for the worst, here is a link to a list of Snyder's 20 ways to defend against tyranny:

<TEXT> I like a lot of this. I think there are a great many Republicans who "believe" that the heart of the party ascribes to the premise you describe. I also think that the Republican party is, at present, spending way too much time, money and resources suppressing science, art and humanities, civil liberties, thwarting necessary oversight and regulation, blurring the line between church and state, and running routes of obfuscation and disinformation on the middle class to keep them thinking that (R) is still in the business of seeding their ability to flourish. I hope to see this imbalance to hit a dead end and soon, and for a retracement. 

If we do ultimately get a "greatest hits"'of (R) and (D), I think this great American experiment will be a resounding success. Right now, I think our democracy has cancer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am proposing that Reddit offer subscription-based journals, periodicals and newspapers a platform wherein Redditors could unlock paywalls on a paid-per-article basis. The transaction would be processed by Reddit, and - less a cut to Reddit - remitted to the publication. The benefit to the Redditor is to gain access to an attractive / compelling article that he / she would normally be unable to read, simply by paying a small amount on the spot, rather than to have to subscribe to an entire publication. 

I am also proposing that within each Redditor's membership profile is an option to confirm one's pre-existing subscriptions, up front, thereby unlocking paywalled publications as per each Redditor's profile. 

Lastly, an "unlock this paywalled article for other redditors" feature would be nice, whereby the person who has posted the paywalled article can pay for others to view the paywalled article. Let's say I post a paywalled article. It's something within a subscription based periodical. Well, most can't read it so it may not gain any traction. Well, let's say I want people to read that article. I'd be willing to pay to unlock it for the first hundred readers. That would generate discussion, upvotes (hopefully). After 100, the article converts back to paywalled. However, redditors can now at least gauge the excitement level based on the upvotes and comments, as a basis to determine whether they want to pay to view it. 

I hope that is a better explanation. 

As to how it is built, well, that's not something I'm qualified to answer. I guess like anything one has to understand the idea first, which I may or may not have just accomplished. Step two is determining if it's something that others would want. So, your opinion would be great, if you get what I'm proposing. Only then does feasibility become critical. Nothing I've suggested is new, and therefore it's entirr

<TEXT> ...register our subscription w/Reddit so it's not charged to us. 

It could work as seamlessly as gold. 

Also, bonus: let's say I really want to post a WSJ article and make the entire article visible to the readers. It would be cool if I could give it gold (or some sort of paid trophy) and essentially buy the first 100 views for readers. Sort of like priming the pump. That way it gives some people a glance, and they can then start the process of liking or hating the article. They pave the way so future people can gauge the upvotes and comments and decide if they want to pay to see it. 

What got me thinking about all of this was tonight's scathing opinion piece on trump. WSJ. I'd have posted that for the world but, of course, I can't. Then I started thinking of the other rags that simply cannot afford to release free articles, and started bandying about this idea. 

I'm not so obtuse as to think you all have not already considered this. But in this moment of inspiration wanted to lend my voice to any existing momentum behind such an effort. 

Love ya, Reddit. You're awesome.

It's hard to display the article, so here is an excerpt:

Yet its really not even that complicated. Whites, and I include Asians here, have chosen winning economic and social strategies that often out-performed the social and economic strategies of those groups with whom theyve been in intense competition for centuries. There has been a competition, and one group, at least for now, seems to be in the lead. If its a privilege, its a hard-won, fully-earned privilege.
Now if you are a member of that group and you want to feel horribly guilty about winning, well you go right ahead. But please, Lily, dont expect me or anyone else to do the same. Yet the race is still being run and the privilege of being out front is up for grabs.
White Just Another Brand
When you boil it all down, and somebody really should do this for Lily-White, its all about reputation; its all about branding - a subject </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey man, sorry to hear. If it's any consolation, I've been right where you are. Hope you can pull through. Just read a few of your prior posts and you have a job, so that's cool, and hope that leads to a better living arrangement soon. 

Don't know how to make you smile. I can tell you my own deal, though: keeping a journal, learning a social trade (like bar tending, baristo, barber), and using that trade to see some new places helped me. I liked having room mates, too - once I got enough of a footing to pay rent. Having good people around kept me more upbeat. 

With my depression, I've noticed keeping my expenses well below my income helps keep my stress low....although I've failed miserably in this regard! 

I hope you continue to fight the good fight, and swim up, and that one by one you get your wins. They won't all be home runs, just base hits, right? 

Cheers,

V </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dude, China's been taxing carbon in 7 districts for several years now. There is no speculation here. They've come right out and said that the science is real, invested heavily into solutions, and signed the Paris Agreement. They've stated that their current pollution levels in major cities are in crisis, fossil fuels force them to rely on foreign powers, and that part of their role as a superpower is to lead the world in renewable energy technology (which they are doing, and have been doing). 

Nothing I've stated above is speculative. These things have happened and are happening. The US has been behind in this arena for a while now. India is in similar straits (as China) and is fast tracking renewables, and for the same reasons. 

Now, I'll offer my opinion as to why these countries are able to see the forest for the trees: these countries aren't oligarchies, in bed with big tobacco, oil and the military industrial complex. Yes, they have their own problems...but in this arena we are the jack asses. Until people like you see this, we will continue to stagnate and risk being an empire in decline. I, for one, choose to fight.  </TEXT>

China is implementing a national cap-and-trade system this year. They've pledged for clean energy to represent a minimum of their total energy production by 2030. After the Paris Climate Agreement, old fears that developing countries like India and China wouldn't act on climate change became outdated.  </TEXT>

I reviewed Reddit's lengthy definition on spamming. No, I am
not spamming. One can place articles into multiple communities if they are topically relevant and if one engages in dialogue in each community. I do both. So, yeah. Wrong-o on both counts. And, finally, lest I forget to mention (again) that this is my second post in r/Michigan, ever. The first post generated 287 upvotes and some great dialogue, which is unsurprising, given that Michigan is thriving with people keen on civil rights, climate change mitigation and other things about which I am passionate and well informed.  </TEXT>

I've posted two articles to r/Michigan, ever. Both are topically relevant to Michigan. If I read an article and deem it worthy of posting to inspire dialogue, and do so in a reasonable manner, it would seem to me that this is in keeping with the spirit of Reddit.

<TEXT> Dude. If I lived in the Netherlands we would invite you to live in our spare bedroom indefinitely. As it stands, we live in the US. If the shit hits the fan, and you can get here, consider this an open invitation to a loving family (of atheists!) that champions science, civil rights and separation of church and state. We have a university up the street. 

Never look back.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd say check out Rocky Point in addition to the other suggestions. That puts you in a really cool spot - 10 minutes to downtown, but also on a small but really cool beach area with jet ski rentals, volleyball, and some great waterfront restaurants and bars. The rent may be above your price point but I'm not sure. I lived there for many years, and back then the entry level apartment was $800. Given the current market it's probably significantly higher. However, with a look I'd say, given your interests.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Phew. Well, that's a huge relief. I imagine my wife will be disappointed, though, as a scientist, engineer and aspiring astrophysicist, and as a chapter leader in Citizens Climate Lobby, to learn that all those hours have been wasted. 

 nbsp;

And I imagine my friend who owns the most accurate weather prediction service in the world, which she started after doing extensive work with HAARP, will be "sad" (to coin a trump parlance), too. And to think she's been simply chasing her tail.....To be clear, she holds degrees from two Ivys, high-level top secret government clearance, and a mathematical theory that she authored...and today she's being set straight by our own EPA on basic climate change science...that's gotta be a bit of a Debbie Downer. I think I'll call her and talk her up a little. I'll remind her that she's great in the kitchen.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think so. It was meant to be a bit tongue in cheek, as I got caught up in the foil of your careful and eloquent analysis of Constitutional law versus Trump's brazen and belligerent, bull-in-China-shop, plundering of this highest office. It's...let's just say I'm with you in that it's utterly imperative that when we strike we win, and as such it's too soon to pull the trigger. I'll add that you are right to brandish critical thinking over irrational exuberance, given that an emotionally charged 57% approval rating for impeachment among Democrats is immaterial to gauging the success of impeachment proceedings - especially with a Republicsn senate. Ultimately, I think that where we may differ is that I fundamentally think that Trump has crossed the line, and egregiously so. Violation of emoluments, twice. Revocable trust. Wire tapping allegation, Obama. A stretch perhaps, but the adamant denial of any contact with Russia, staff included, proven to be lies at every turn. I have more, but the black and white gets more grey. 

Personally, I hope he goes away in cuffs. But I'll settle for impeachment, recusal, anything that stops the bleeding. The climate can't wait for this nonsense to play out for 4 (or 8) years, but I digress.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's great that you like the U.S. 

I think that you and I can agree that by "subjective opinion" you mean "results of a survey". 

Let's delve into this particular survey and kick the tires a bit - theirs and yours:

You understand that the sample was 21,000 people - internationals of mixed socioeconomic background? 

You read who conducted the survey? Wharton? US News and World Report? You know that both are conservative, right? (I ask because you lean conservative). 

So, assuming we are still together on this, where do we disconnect? 
Was it simply that their conclusions deviate from your own, or is there something about this data collection methodology that is broken? Science asks questions, so GetSoft4u, I ask: What is your basis for disregarding this survey?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dude, it was a kiss. It's great that you have a sense of accountability for your actions but seriously you gotta let this go. And if you get busted, own it. Apologize, but maintain your dignity, and move on. Don't be so scared. Life is short.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like that. 

Glenn surprised me. He always seemed confident in his worldview. Milo for some reason just smacks of someone who is putting on a front, pandering, attention seeking, behind which is a terrified child. I think that Glenn found something, and I was surprised because I never realized he was looking. I think Milo is running away from himself. Milo will continue to refine himself into full blown sociopathy, or, as I hope, he will implode, drop the bullshit, and in the process find his humanity. If the latter, then I'll be the first to welcome him into adulthood. If the former, then I hope the world rejects him like a cancerous cell, because cancer is fucking dangerous.  </TEXT>

For the foreseeable future, however, his antics are, at very least, criminally stupid - and at worst, dangerous. The faster he hits bottom, the better. 

Today was a step in the right direction.  </TEXT>

He kept Y (sorry, don't even want to gratify that kid with placing nam in print) from embarking on a troll feeding frenzy, and he still managed to elicit from Y a very excellent demonstration of the childishness that drives his perspective. Maher also gave the other panelists great latitude in roasting Y, which they handled exteemely well. That rounded it it. To me, Maher won. </TEXT>

I know and respect that his stance on reverse time travel is - on the well established basis of prevailing knowledge of physics - negative. However, in context with, say, simulated universe theory, the worldview is expanded, as are the permutations of interpreting why no attendees, allowing for alternative logical constructs:

- they choose not to be seen;

- it was chosen for them not to be seen;

- they convinced him that, hey, best to shut up about their presence.

<TEXT> If our brains were binary, we would of course have all of this Black History data always factored in to an algorithm to safeguard the continued transcendence over our more primal / tribal / xenophobic directives. 

But we are of course not binary. Our brains sort by stimuli, and we are constantly bombarded by stimuli. The only way for the brain's neural network to ingest non-mission-critical data is to have it highlighted and categorized in some fashion. 

Black history is a subset of American history (categorization). One month per year distinguishes this subset from, say, the Industrial Revolution - and aligns it with, say, certain other subsets, like the Holocaust - and in doing so, pays homage to victims and heroes, and also mitigates the potential for a repeat of history (lest we forget the lesson). Culturally, there is also a tertiary effect of having this month profiled at the federal level...as it sends the message from the top of our rather racially divided nation: Black history matters.

<TEXT> You know, I have an alert for atheism and, whilst wolfing down a quick meal, read this article without ingesting that it was writ for The New American. At the end, I even mistook, "...the religious shall inherit the earth" for sarcasm. 

I have just now re-read this piece with inner monologue adjusted to aggravated, and apologize for posting it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exceptionally well articulated. I am an atheist and yet have still chosen to share this essay with my audience.

I'll pull the lense back from American civil religion and digress: it pains me to see the lengths to which his erstwhile Christian fan base will go to brandish him as one of them. Their pivot to forgiveness for his rampant and belligerent "moral" transgressions barely qualifies as a cheap parlor trick. The very valid analysis laid out in this essay leaves Christians even less wiggle room to deny his heresy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Between Trump's association with that group and his dubious and possibly financial ties to Russia, I can see that being fairly high on the list of why or what would start the impeachment process.

Yes: Pressure. In its myriad forms. And proven. And the faster it builds, the better, as per your observation that they are rushing to jam everything through as we speak. (Apprentice archives would help, too).

<TITLE> An engineer and a scientist walk into a dive bar.... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-23 00:52:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Smiling, happy, the engineer says, "Bartender, shots for everyone!"

The bartender leans in, confused, "I can tell you're not from around here. Are you sure you want to buy these people drinks?"

The scientist retorts with, "Make 'em doubles!"

The bartender deploys the drinks to everyone around the smoky bar, the newcomers raise their glasses, and everyone drinks.

The scientist and the engineer then pay their substantial tab, leave a generous tip, and pull away in a Tesla. Naturally, everyone is a bit confused about what just happened, but before long everyone gets back to NASCAR, NFL, Fox, country music, cigarettes, cheap beer, Trump, and arguing about Ford versus Chevy.

While the engineer sets the car to autopilot, the scientist pulls up this very joke, half composed, on his iPad, and with furrowed brow says, "We still need a punch line."

The engineer nods in affirmation, and says, "Look in the rear view mirror."

He looks. The small dive bar recedes into the darkness as the Tesla picks up speed, rapidly and silently.

"They don't even remember us. We worked our asses off, moved away to the city, competed with the brightest kids from around the globe, earned advanced degrees, and now we challenge global warming by designing advanced battery systems for electric cars. We have made a fortune along the way. I am 28. You are 29. Those townies will live and die back there. By choice. 14 mile per gallon trucks. Shit beer. Staying, sitting, stewing, and waiting for progress to come to them.

"There's your f-ing punch line." </TEXT>

Thus far your comments are unrelated to expressing ways of thinking and feeling as pertains to this topic.

<TEXT> About Keith Girard, author: 

Keith Girard 30 years of experience as a reporter, editor-in-chief, and senior media executive. Keiths career began in Washington, D.C., where he was a reporter for The Washington Post and worked as a contributing editor for Regardies, a regional business magazine, and Washingtonian magazine.

In 1992, he became editor-in-chief of The Daily Record, a six-day business and legal newspaper published statewide in Maryland and editor of its sister publication, Warfields Business Record, a weekly newspaper. In its third year of publication, Warfields was named the best regional business newspaper in the United States by the Association of Area Business Publications (AABP), a national trade group that represents 68 newspapers. In 1996, he merged Warfields into The Daily Record to become part of its expanded weekend edition. The following year, the AABP named The Daily Record the best business publication in the United States.

In all, the paper won more than 60 editorial awards under his tenure from the Maryland, Delaware, D.C. Press Association, the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ), the Associated Press, and the Society of American Business Editors and Writers (SABEW) for reporting, editorial writing, graphics and layout, and design. Through his work at The Daily Record, Girard gained a reputation for turning around publications and was recruited by Crain to take over InvestmentNews at a critical time 18 months after the newspapers launch.

Because of his success at InvestmentNews, he attracted the attention of VNU Business Media and was offered the role of editor-in-chief of Billboard magazine. As editor-in-chief of Billboard magazine, Keith oversaw a global staff with five bureaus in the United States and one in the United Kingdom. In just one year, he engineered a complete overhaul of the newspaper and led the paper through a strategic redirection that included two staff reorganizations, expanded coverage, the opening of a San Francisco bureau to cover digital music, the launch of a new Web site and Billboards first e-newsletters and a major industry event focused on touring.

In his own reporting career, Keith has won nearly two dozen journalism awards for feature writing, general reporting, investigative reporting, editorial writing, headlines, and publication layout and design. He has written one book, on the role of the Marines in Operation Desert Shield/Storm. In 1982, he was named one of the 100 future leaders of Washington, D.C., by Washingtonian magazine.

<TEXT> I was at a Dartmouth hiking lodge up in NH. Someone broke out extremely dank crippy. We gazed into the firelight and smoked for hours. Smoking and taking and gazing. After a while the light in the embers just started to come alive as patterns and, eventually, as full on little creatures. It is was quite fun. The rational side of me knew it was simply the weed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is not so black and white to many of us. This headline asks a question and then endeavors to answer it. I don't see how this article or this resulting dialogue disrespects the democratic process. There is a system. It is being tested. 

You're likely arguing in defense of what you think protects the American people, and I certainly feel that I am doing the same. We are America, and we are all trying like hell to figure out the next steps. What happened was a big deal. To wave that away is disingenuous. My work trying to dispell the onslaught of fake news throughout this election was exhaustive and futile. So from my perspective - dealing in boring and mundane facts versus a barrage of Macedonian bloggers ad nauseum - it was like my team showed up clean and the opponent was on steroids. Literally half of my Republican friends still believe Hillary ran a child sex ring. Dude. That shit is bananas.  </TEXT>

My son showed me a YouTube of a girl who did 100 push ups a day for a year. She started out only able to do a few at a time. By year's end she's able to do all 100 at once. Her physical transformation is awesome. After a month, I am now doing 70 a day. I started out at 25 per day. (Was not up to going for 100 at the start). 

This is a simple thing to make a daily routine. It makes me feel great.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dropped out of college and went into sales. Met a ton of interesting people along the way. Partied, traveled.  By contrast, my wife (whom I met and married many years later) worked as a bartender, completed bachelors and masters, and landed a great job at graduation. 

I have made a living in a niche industry that does not require a college degree. We are both six figure earners....But money is just money:

She has a far greater number of opportunities as a direct result of her academic accomplishments. She is totally immersing herself in opportunities and interests on a level that I simply cannot. As we grow older these things will pay life enrichment dividends exponentially. 

I beat the odds. My strategy of focusing on one thing in sales has worked (so far). (I've also seen a lot of really focused individuals buck the trend and forgo school to instead work and / or start a business that reflects their talent and passion.) I guess my "success" is told as a cautionary tale...because I would hate to see anyone leave school and then fail to thrive...which is all too common.

<TEXT> Powerful. I hope you find some peace today, and for the remainder of your time there this holiday. 

When I was young, it was pre-internet. I felt suffocated by the way my mother dominated the home atmosphere. Glad you have the ability to reach out, as you have here. Hoping you have friends available on FB, etc, to reach as well. Hoping too that you have a place to maybe go out for a stroll or a jog, or a beer or a coffee or a toke...

Guess what I'm trying to share is that dipping out for my little self indulgences has helped me, and still does.

<TEXT> Can you pursue getting it expunged? 

1-I hope over time you can come to healthy terms with this unfortunate situation. Seems to me that the majority of popular opinion here on Reddit is that you were dealt a bad hand. That is likely true in the court of opinion out in the real world, too. Hoping that improves your morale. Hoping that you will invest in loving and taking care of yourself. 

2-i recommend staying in the country. Winning is often less about waging an aggressive offense, and more about patience, minimizing mistakes, and waiting for an easy opportunity. Fleeing will likely have a cascading effect of unintended consequences. Stay. Develop good relationships with good people. As you grow your circle of friends, you grow sphere of influence. Reasonable opportunities will avail themselves.

Oh, here's a cool one. So, my son is 8 years old at the time. We are walking in Harvard Square and I see Michio Kaku approaching us. He's engrossed in conversation. While out of earshot I quietly tell my son who is approaching. Well, my son then says, "What?" just as Michio enters our earspace...Michio looks up briefly, and I maintain eye contact and say, "that's Michio Maku," and received a warm smile. That was a pretty cool shared moment.  </TEXT>

Get a job as a bar back. Play in a band. Do all of these things. Return to school, or don't. You Mom has an old school view of education. Without joy and focus it's a waste.

<TEXT> True. I used the reply by ratspeels above and built my response off of it. 

This Trump-getting-elected thing has really opened my eyes to the fact that a significant portion of society is lacking fact checking skills. And, moreover, a significant portion of society is administering disinfo and misinfo onto these uninformed people with relative ease. So, yeah, I'm trying to wage rebuttals in the face of these unfounded claims and assertions-stated-as-facts. This DARPA thing is particularly distressing. Peaceful, unarmed water protectors getting their asses kicked while the majority of the world dismisses them. They need popular opinion behind them if they are ever going to have even a chance against the dark forces being levied against them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi. I'm posting the above link here in hopes that those in the know here will offer a line-item counterpoint. 

I've been following DAPL very closely, but only recently - beginning with watching the live streaming of the horrifying night of water cannons; since then, I've been tuning in daily to each stream and have been slowly (finally) seeing this story cross the line into mainstream media. 

I'll add that the longer it has taken major media to acknowledge the brutality against the water protestors on that evening, the more outraged I have become. 

Thus far, I have seen credible journalism presented as either protestor-positive or protestor-neutral. I have seen op eds on both sides. And on the non-credible side, I have seen shady pseudo-media sites (reminiscent of the stuff we saw that helped trump get elected) post extremely hateful pieces on the water protectors. 

So, now onto the link above. Orlando Sentinel. That's a credible newspaper, and the author is arguing that we are not getting the complete picture, and it is presenting a data filled argument to back up its claims. I am really hoping someone with a deeper knowledge of this topic can help me get to the truth: are there two sides? 

Either way, the treatment of the water protectors is inexcusable. I will not dismiss one iota of what I've seen. However, if there has been credible outreach by the architects of this pipeline to the community at large, I want to know. And of course if there hasn't, and this article is bs, I want to know. What I don't want to do is ignore this article because - unlike the crap spewed forth by, say, a shady Facebook page called Netizens for Progress - this above article is 'news', and now needs to be scrutinized.  </TEXT>

There is an air of excitement, too. 

Right now we are just word of mouth. We would like to expand our services into this arena - into states like CO and beyond. You mention Florida. Our east coast headquarters is in Tampa, FL. Our west coast headquarters are in OR. 

If there is the potential for synergy please feel free to reach out. If your business model permits, then perhaps you can vet us - and maybe even mentor is a bit - and we can strive to be a preferred vendor within your network.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, the amnesia is tragic. I'm convinced that there exists a happy medium in some people's brains, wherein they can still access visualization capabilities in a fully awakened state (sans psychotic break). Emphasis "see" meaning in mind's eye, versus hallucinate. As an example, my wife, an engineer and aspiring astrophysicist, can "see" math formulas. And my friend - an architect and artist - can "see" what he is sketching.

I am hopeful that there just might be an artist here in the nootropic community that uses noots in order to access their creative potential.  </TEXT>

You're right, it's hard to qualify a descriptor like "complex" in this context. Do you recall dreams? If so, can you relate to how real and vivid your dreams are? If so, this might be an apt way to convey the level of complexity...it's every bit as real as the images your brain conjures in a dream.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed. I imagine that an artist can tap into this state of mind more easily than the average person. Guessing that I'm below average in my wakeful state, given that I can conjure only very vague images (in mind's eye). I certainly cannot draw. 

By contrast, I can write. My "gift", if you will, seems to be audio...I hear what I think. I can see words, and hear music, too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will continue to try. It is so far impossible for me to get back into that quiet, relaxed mental state. I can sometimes get a few visuals just prior to falling asleep, but nothing like the first 45 seconds of waking up. It's as fascinating as it is frustrating. The most amazing stuff is in the beginning, and then the ability degrades into eventual chaos, and then nothing. I can only surmise that this imagery is the remaining neurochemical elixir that permits the visual component of dreaming, eroding as it is being flushed out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Each morning I awaken to 45 or so seconds of what is, for me, an exquisite ability to render images in my mind. I can only imagine that this is the ability that permits an artist to create. 

As my state of mind becomes more alert, for lack of a better term, the ability scatters, and my inner thoughtscape becomes dimensionless. In its place, thoughts consists of my inner monologue and, usually, repetitive music (ear worm). 

I am forever searching Google for a new way to facilitate this capability into my fully awakened state, and so far to no avail. Can anyone shed light onto what neural chemistry permits this skill, and how I might attain it?

* Update / Reply: Thank you. It's great to wake up to helpful Reddit feedback. As to the one reply that asked for a link to an example of an image: in this brief interval, it can be any image. I'm aware and in control. So, numbers, lines, pictures; it is particularly fun to morph animated objects into one another, a style portrayed by, say, Bill Plympton.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Turmeric is a spice containing a chemical called curcumin, which may be helpful. I take Longvida Circubrain. 

Turmeric is proven to help with inflammation, including inflammatory bowel disease, and it is regarded as safe to ingest. Many think that the patented "Longvida Circubrain" crosses the blood brain barrier and effects cognitive enhancement; I have no idea if it actually does. I do, however, assert that my experience with this product has been positive. 

I have yet to find a "cure all" for the issues you describe, but hope that turmeric might be considered as you build your stack. </TEXT>

At 40, did you introduce anything new to your existing nootropic / supplement regimen? I know my feedback is purely anecdotal, but Adderall gave me major fog between doses, L-Theanine wipes me out, fish oil makes me depressed, and multi vitamins make me tongue tied...and, yes, all of this is weird, but suffice to say if you started anything new at onset of your issues, I hope you've experimented with removing them in order to eliminate variables.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whoa, easy there fella. Happily married guy here, who can relate to some of your youthful folly, with some advice: learn the word NEXT. You're getting stuck. (Glad you now see it as a TIFU, but still feel compelled to drive this point home, because remnants of your dramatic state of mind appear to still be vying for control over you, and that worries me.)

People converge, run parallel, and diverge. Life is long. Go with the flow, and that means knocking off all that introspective angst.  

Good luck fighting the good fight, my friend. This round is "man versus himself". And it's about loving yourself, and learning to have some fun with yourself, socially, and taking things with the ladies lightly. Otherwise, you are smart and studious: you almost have your shit together, which is awesome :)

<TEXT> Hi, I'm just copy / pasting my Craigslist "Wanted" here in case one of my fellow redditirs can help. Thanks! 

Wanted: boat rental, Newfound Lake (Newfound Lake)
9 Mayhew
(google map)

I'm on the lake through August 3. I have a FL boater license which is reciprocal with NH, and own a 44' in FL, and have owned a small boat and personal watercraft in the past. Looking for a boat and a tube to take my son and nephew out on, and hoping someone on the lake might have one available to rent. Our house rental has a dock and a mooring buoy. I'd rent a couple of fenders, too, if available. </TEXT>

I didn't post a rant about smokers walking down a city street, or outside of buildings, or with their windows down at red lights, or with their other hand pushing a stroller. Nope.

<TEXT> Well, the first thing I do is identify why I am so mad. Mad is a primal drive. Forcing the more evolved part of my brain to participate, by asking "why" intellecualizes it, helps me to disengage from the rage. 

For me, "why" is not, say, "because he stole my money", but rather, "why am I freaking out?!?" Generally the basis for my anger is that I am either hurt or afraid. How to position myself to be ok again then becomes my replacement energy. Evolved me solves problems. Primal me just makes noise. Cooler heads prevail. 

It feels absolutely amazing to convert rage into cool and sharp thinking. It is empowering. Quick example: she cheated on me! Instant rage. 

Scenario One: Punch wall, flip couch, go out drinking all night, talk shit "f that bitch", start smoking again, blah-blah-blah-insert-cliche-behavior. Solves nothing. 

Scenario Two: Calm down. I am just hurt and scared....Why? We had a plan. It's hard to change that plan. We have a lease. A dog. Common friends. I am embarrassed....How can I fix? I can either forgive her and request counseling or this is a long overdue wake up call. I think this is a wake up call. She has lied to me before. I am going to leave this apartment now, go to my best friend's place, and start looking for a room mate. People are betrayed all the time and somehow they survive. I will. 

I don't know how old you are, or your situation. And I don't need to know. These tactics are universal. They will be helpful to you. "It's not how you act. It's how you react." </TEXT>

<TEXT> The mind is wild, isn't it? We are all wired so differently. Two people smoke pot: one hyper focuses, the other can't spell her name. For some of us, a job is therapeutic. For others, a jail sentence. Last night, I was reading that 2% of us cannot see images in our mind. 

For people with ADHD (and who are struggling as a result of it), it is ultra important to seek therapeutic guidance in order to stay on task and on track. The problem is that to the person with ADHD this often seems counter-intuitive, a phenom that manifests as ODD (oppositional defiance disorder). This might be the paranoia you see in your friend. For someone else, it might be lashing out at a teacher, a school, or "the system". 

ODD is what I hope OP will avoid. Life is too short. We will all take a lot of shit along the way, and some ADHD people - especially ambitious ones - can be damaged very easily without proper guidance. Others can avoid stress and mute symptoms. Still more can - with help and extra effort - become doctors, lawyers, CEOs, et al.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That depends. Does your career and / or do your passions and goals play to your strengths? If, say, you function well in quiet environments, and you work in a library, then it is likely in this context to be of minimal impact. 

ADHD, like many disorders, is exacerbated under stress. Unfortunately there is no cure for ADHD - only treatment - and treatment is only partial and, moreover, comes with side effects. This is not an argument against treatment, however. Exercise is your first and best option. It may not be enough, and if not then see a psychopharmacologist, and see if therapy and pills are helpful. Be mindful of any advice given, and follow their instructions to the letter. 

As with anything, you will need to give any treatment time...say, six months, in order to evaluate efficacy. That includes exercise. So, start with evaluating whether the challenges of your life aspirations jive with your innate strengths or weaknesses and, if to your weaknesses, then start treating your ADHD.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recommend a design firm. Palo Alto services lots of freshly minted young millionaires who have homes that either so historic or so centrally located that they cannot or should not be razed. It is a hot bed for design firms, who meet with the home owner, determine the wish list, and then deliver 3D renderings at every stage of conception until the final draft is agreed upon. Some design firms are all-in-one, where they are also the GC and see the process all the way through - from initial renderings through the build.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was once an unwilling participant in this situation. The girl was just over-the-top loud. I wasn't going to let it interrupt our session, but at the same time I knew on some level that it had to be a serious source of aggravation for anyone directly adjoining her condo. Well, the police eventually showed up. Thankfully, post coitus. I answered her door, and there were two cops. One female, one male. Female was by the book, informing me of the noose compliant and asking for cessation. The male stood just a half step behind her, and never spoke a word. He did give me a rather coy thumbs up and, during my reprimand, mouthed, "it's ok". I let them know that it was he girl's condo, and that she was too mortified to come to the door, and that she was quite apologetic. I never revisited the scene of the crime, but I suspect that the next dude didn't get the same level of theatrics that I did.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [TASK] take our employee application and make it paperless, including signature. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-24 16:25:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We are an American company. The employee new hire application is several pages, including the new hire information page, the consent to drug test page, the I9 and W4 pages. 

Our employee new hire application is a PDF, and it's auto-fill. For example, if an employee types in their name it fills out remaining areas that require their name. At present, employees type into fields and then print it all out in order to sign. Then they scan / fax to me. 

I'd like to make it totally paperless. And that means making it possible for them to digitally sign. But here is the problem: these employees are not always computer savvy enough to download the necessary tools to do a digital signature. So I need you to make it so easy a child could do it. I want them to be able to sit in their home and to take their mouse and to draw their signature onto the application. 

I am comfortable with an estimate for services. This is something that I'm sure you will want to review, etc., to better familiarize yourself with the document. 

Update: thank you redditors for you myriad of responses. Every one is helpful, and I've no doubt you all can handle this project. Your approaches are, for the most part, unique from one another. I will now take the weekend to review your replies and will then ask questions as needed, in order to determine the candidate.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Join a running club. There are some that include bar hopping. But for purposes of giving you a non-drinking option, a running club. Running is in of itself a great tool for releasing serotonin and endorphins. That post-run feeling is pretty awesome. Add to that, sun...Vitamin D. 

Also, consider an SNRI. Pretty good medicine, and these days the generics are available so also cheap. 

Seriously, though...I have to acknowledge the whiskey comment...nothing overcomes social anxiety as well as a few drinks. I just know that one has to be careful; something as good as alcohol can be Pandora's box for someone with social anxiety.

For example:

http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/baybuzz/lgbt-pride-flag-raised-after-orlando-shooting-unbearable-for-christian/2282099

...probably not a prefect reply to your question. 

Without getting into the nuances, I will just say that I hate that our country is still debating whether, say, a rainbow flag or a cake might offend someone, and I really hate that the offendees use - ironically - the laws which protect our amazing freedoms as a basis to argue for their religious "rights" to treat others as lesser people.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> All of our sales associates are commission only. They are independent contractors. Most do well, once they get going, due to the residual component. And because we are a good company, meaning we retain the customers they bring to us, and we honor our commission obligations in perpetuity. 

In my opinion, the best category of income type is commission. One step up is residual commission. 

The ideal is passive residual commission. Meaning, auto pilot. That's like when you develop your craft - whatever it is that you do - to generate residual income, and then hire others to run it all. To me, replacing one's own job, stepping aside, and yet still collecting income is the best-in-class wealth accumulation strategy to strive for. That way, when you work...it is a choice.  </TEXT>

I will add glitches. Stuff like missing time experiences. Reddit.glitch offers a vast data trove of these types of experiences. Fascinating posts and yet, stripped of their anonymity, I doubt many redditors would feel comfortable sharing these types of experiences with the public.

<TEXT> As for the book, two thumbs up. Flow, continuity, suspense, style all lend themselves to fast, gripping, fun, immersive reading. Reminds me of Clive Cussler. I listened to the Coast to Coast interview with Tom Delonge and AJ Hartley prior to reading, thanks to the Dropbox link provided here last week, and I think that learning the backstory enhanced my interest and enjoyment. 

As to the veracity, I am in wait-and-see mode. This book was only the first of his many anticipated deliverables, both fiction and non fiction. It will be interesting to see the level of endorsement that he receives from long tenured peers in the community, like Leslie Kean and John Podesta.

In most cases it comes back as 6 pages. In some cases it comes back a 17 pages and the extras are old pages that were previously discarded. Can someone tell me how to prevent this from happening? The only consistent thing we have determined so far is that it is old computers that are printing this as 17 pages.

<TEXT> People do what they do because they want to. Whether they admit this to you - or even to themselves. Did you ever see the movie "he's not that into to you?" It does a nice job exploring the imbalances that occur in relationships where differing needs and interests result in confusion similar to your post.

You have options in how you react: distancing yourself, lowering your expectations, and / or accepting them are all examples of moving beyond analysis and into a place where you are happier. Ultimately your own happiness is your goal. Reducing your reliance on others will make you stronger (and it also attracts more compatible people into your life). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like the long game when it comes to owning. Here are the upsides to the long game:

- the tax advantage of being able to write off loan interest. 
- the long term positive roi on real estate. 
- the financial discipline that owning a home teaches (baptism by fire)
- over time you can pay the principal down (make payments on the back)
- rent it out of you outgrow it
- equity line against it if you need to draw on equity in the future 

Good luck. There is no bad decision renting vs owning.

<TEXT> I obviously am not informed on you metabolic situation, but perhaps time to start counting calories. If you have been overeating, then you will find that once your stomach shrinks you'll find the hunger pains are less and smaller portions will fill you up. Between that and the gym you might be quite happy with yourself in less time than you think. 

As for the girl, well...what she said was mean and I wouldn't waste a worry on her. Continue to focus on you and your self image, inside and out, and the girls will come.

Hope some of this advice is relevant and helpful.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The grades are important, sure. Finishing (college) is of primary importance, and exceptional grades are secondary. Finishing college with a great network and reputation, decent grades, and leveraging your network and reputation to get a good job, priceless. Doing this and watching your costs along the way by going to a community college / state school (if American), even better. 

Starting college, getting hammered at every opportunity, sputtering out after two years, stuck with loans to pay, meh. I did this. Took me forever to catch up. 

If you're lazy, just be efficient. But stay in the game. Much later in life I mitigated some darker undercurrents that contributed to my own laziness, namely adhd and depression, by exercising and taking an antidepressant. You may have some personal demons to face, too. If so, fight the fight. Worth it. College is chalk full of opportunities to enrich your life experience and, ultimately, your financial well being. The more you can dial yourself in to this, the better.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks. Very helpful tool. I just ran it in every one of my active domains. I actually found what appear to be some spam triggers on one of them. 

I ended up overcoming the issue I posted about by replying to the reply-to link provided within each of the 35 "spam-undeliverable" alerts, and per the instructions, uploading a copy of each original (sent) email. 

24-hours later, the problem was completely remedied. 

Then, in order to distance our ongoing email marketing campaigns from our main company domain, I created a marketing landing page (under a similar domain name), and campaigns run out of the site. 
Not surprisingly, that site is the one that your tool revealed some spam blocking.

Also, GoDaddy has a 250 email limit per SMTP per day if I understand correctly. I've instructed my VA to limit sent emails to this number. I have been doing 400-600 per day with no trouble, for years, but I guess ignorance is bliss. Now that I'm actually researching this stuff I'm becoming more conservative. Any input is appreciated (on whether capping my daily emails is smart) is appreciated.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> In search of automating my email campaign </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-20 17:47:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I need this to look as though the emails are hand sent by my staff. I need to load my contacts in (approximately 50,000) from excel. I need to hit a button and have each email go out with the contact first name embedded twice in the email, and their company name once. My three questions:

Can I do this?
Which app/software/cloudware do I need to buy?
Does the bottom of the email give any indication of the app/software/cloudware. Like "sent by constant contact" in small print?

For years, I have had an overseas staff that take my email template, paste it into an email, and add the custom items, and send. They do 400 a day. The overseas staff emails are all part of my web domain, etc, and I have had no spam issues because my contacts are all people in my industry receiving updates. 

My intention is to automate this project. 

Any help is greatly appreciated.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hiring employees in the U.S. requires a learning curve, but it's not that steep. And, Zen (or whomever) can handle the bulk of the compliance in this regard. You will simply remit to Zen by ACH the balance of wages plus FICA, FUTA, SUTA and workers comp (required in OH on non-owners; incidentally, you will report any office employee under class code 8810 which is cheap; sales employees are 8742, also cheap). 

As for 10-99, I'd go that route for web design. 

I'd personally do 10-99 for your sales people, too. As for throwing a little weekly 10-99 cash to your sales people who need a few bucks each week, well, put it in your accounting as payment on a project (help with marketing, whatever). 

I have many employees, and many 10-99 people, and have an expert understanding of their respective definitions and compliance requirements. And I am no rocket scientist.  

Here's comp 101:

<TEXT> I like: 

- independent contractors for sales: Honest income; easy to set up; easy to track; few moving parts. 

- employees and VA's for ops/admin. 

- partners who bring sweat and / or equity

I am cautious about whom we hire, and how, and whether we expand. Yet I have friends I'd hire and friends I would not hire. My point: They're not mutually exclusive. 

You've demonstrated a good track record in business and in life. You're structuring mutually beneficial relationships to meet your individual wants and needs. I wager that your instincts will tell you what to do. If expansion makes sense, you'll pull the trigger. If you're seeing too many moving parts, bad timing, or high risk, I think you'll throttle back. If you make a false move, you'll adapt or retrace. 

One piece of advice: outsource that employee paperwork if you do go that route. Do the Zen suggestion, or hire a local accountant. That stuff is onerous. And rote. You need to stay in your zone.

<TEXT> I have built my own VA team to assist my US companies. Perhaps my experience / model will help you:

Several years ago I used onlinejobs.ph, which was excellent, and upon finding a good person I then had her recruit others. Essentially she became the manager and the additionals that she found became my team. I paid her a US $1 / hr override on her recruits, and US $3.5 / hr on all work she herself did for me. 

She's no longer with me, but the top recruit is now my new manager and he now recruits team members. I pay him US $3.50 / hr. Plus his US $1 override. Weekly, PayPal. I pay the team US $0.75 / hr. 

As a manager he is my single point of contact. He spreadsheets work status into my shared Dropbox and updates me by email and Voxer. Voxer is a free app and functions like a Nextel phone. I pay him, he pays everyone. 

Each team member has a name that I created and utilizes an email address created thru my domain. As such, if they are sending emails to my clients and prospects it is not obvious that they are VA's. I should also mention that I write the template emails which they then modify and personalize per recipient. 

Their emails signatures bear my company logo and contact info but with a twist: I have placed my cell number into their signatures. I do this so that all phone responses come to me. Yeah, I get calls all the time from people asking for one of my team members...and I just say that their phone is forwarded to me today and that I'm a colleague who can answer their questions.

<TEXT> Make sure you do well on SAT. Grades, too. Not necessary for either to be perfect, based on your needs at present. In life, however, you want to avoid egregious stats in three things: academics, credit, and driving. I call it staying off the radar. But I digress.

After you wrap up high school, consider going to a community college in order to improve cash flow and / or reduce or eliminate loan dependence. Community college is inexpensive and, generally speaking, if you do reasonably well you will qualify for practically guaranteed admission into your state school to do junior / senior years.

Upsides: You can schedule community college classes around your entrepreneurial pursuits, lower your bottom line cost of living, and still head off to university if / when you decide it feels right. In short, you hedge your bet. 

You are still in your formative years. Those two years of gen eds looming in your academic future will in fact help build you, strengthen you, and improve your character, despite your current misgivings. (Yes, admittedly they are hard to quantify, but building a well rounded intellect in a challenging, formal setting is more than just an ancient Roman tradition. It works). The social component of college is a second non-linear benefit, but nonetheless huge; as an example, let's quickly delve into the networking benefit. Colleges are breeding grounds for innovation; those 1%-ers find each other in college, and the proof is in the incredible number of ventures that have been born by a person like you building, or at least beginning, a dream out of a dorm room. 

I left college. I went into sales. My wife, by contrast, will start her doctoral soon. She knew early on that her interests were math, engineering, and astro-physics. I knew that my long term goals were not-yet-defined, and that finding my way was going to require an off-the-beaten path process of immersion into a myriad of short term life experiences. In retrospect, I would have opted for the more moderate model I am describing for you. The word moderate sounds meh (damn those Romans) but the reality is it is very challenging and rewarding. 

There is an old saying: if you want find someone to make time for you, ask the busiest person. It sounds counterintuitive, but it is true.
My opinion: Indulge your intellect and your entrepreneurialism. You can do both. 

Best success.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> OP I recommend that you pursue dialogue with this respondent. I was just waiting until someone said, hey, I have some experience and I want to consider investing. You have nothing to lose by engaging in dialogue, and potentially a condiserable upside if a strategic collaboration can get you to critical mass. 

For what it's worth, I think you are doing a ton of things right, speaking from the gut and also joining the chorus of other positive reviews in this regard.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are several vaguaries, generalizations and suppositions in your post, and they trend toward sounding optimistic. Not a criticism, but just an acknowledgement to serve as a precursor to my response:

Based on the information provided, my bare bones - and yet nonetheless emphatic - answer is to err on the side of caution: Open just the one, and I mean to do so if and only if you have really done your homework. (Conversely, IF I were to base my answer on what you "think", and IF you could get 'em launched in time for the holiday shopping season, and IF you have experience, and IF you have capital, and IF you have savings, then I would say to play multiple RMU's and hope for the 80/20 rule to manifest a bunch of base hits and a few home runs).

If it's the holiday season that has you excited and in a rush, I can't blame you. But when you're in a lease with a mall (or malls) during the doldrum months, the long game may be more harrowing than you anticipate. I guess I just want you to ask yourself if, stripped of the dopaminegic release of dreaming big, this idea of yours can still stand on its own legs, or if this thing could flop. If the answer is the latter, then mitigate the risk by executing your dream in a more microcosmic fashion, ie by doing just one RMU, and book the win, and in so doing buy a year to innovate your next novel idea and expansion campaign whilst all the while gaining valuable hands-on experience.

Addendum: When you say "expand.../...without being present", I hope that you are alluding to, say, approaching existing RMU vendors and setting them up with your product. Because strategic collaboration sounds well worth exploring as an alternative to building this B M out yourself. 

For now, I sense that you are protecting your idea and strategy and, again, I can't blame you. Hopefully you have some successful friends in your personal brain trust to bounce this idea off of as well. People who know you, your strengths and weaknesses, etc. People who tell you when you rock, but who also tell you when you have bad breath.

Best success.

<TEXT> I would say Restaurantman9 gave a good synopsis up top. 

Also, on a side note, Google around for a free non-disclosure agreement. If you decide to play defense, you can have your fellow collaborators sign it.

One thing, and it's a delicate issue to ask you to wrap your head around. Good ideas are everywhere. Putting together a good team and bringing them to fruition is a challenge and an adventure. It will require you to extend trust, and to sometimes extend trust to the point you are vulnerable. This is a necessary part of building your team. If you get too bogged down trying to protect your idea, you run the risk of stifling the spark that is necessary to begin this process. "Do-it-yourselfers" fall into this category. The furthest a do-it-yourselfer can get in entrepreneurialship is to "self-employed". In parting, I say stay nimble and agile and enjoy the lightness of being that comes with beginning at the beginning.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> His secretary. His CTO. His lawyer. The reschedule of the meeting. Whether this is good or bad, intentional or not, I see indicators that he establishes dominance, wins the deal, and then move on to the next one. So know this: if you do business with him, then you are really going to be doing business with his team - so you'd best like his team. 

If you do this meeting: You are going to express your concerns, and he is going to convince you that your questions are intelligent and that his program is the perfect solution. The harder you work on posing intelligent questions, the better he will sound to you. He is building an echo chamber. Cognitive empathy is the province of sociopaths. 

When you are done, remember that the name of the game is not to determine if he can help, but whether he is the best solution. So, use everything you learn from his model to evaluate not just as your potential strategic alliance, but also in terms of its value versus doing it without him.

Also, if you oblige and reschedule, you are sending a non-verbal cue that you are less important than his schedule. Be aware that this all may be part of his model: to establish very early on that he is a very busy man. I see Alpha all over this. Personally, I would be wary. I would also know that he knows that you are being told to be wary. If you are the enabler type, just run now. If you are psychologically stoic, go and watch a master at his game. If you remain interested, then study the team, his references, and continue to measure this versus all other options.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right on, thanks. 

I feel the same way about NDAs (not sure they work / how, when do you use, if at all). The upside: I never have a problem signing an NDA. My assumption is that you have the tact, diplomacy and the confidence to send that right person your NDA if / when you decide it's appropriate; they will gladly sign it to allay your concern. 

On how much to tell...I don't have an answer. Finding that right person is so crucial. I hate to say it but I operate on feel. There is a great book, How to Be a Star at Work. Horrible title. The book is the culmination of an expensive, extensive multi-year study commissioned by some Fortune 500 to answer the question, "Why do some of our employees become stars?" The data is so mind blowing that they had to revisit, retool and extend the study to really, truly get their heads around the answers, and on the second go around the answers remained the same. I suggest you find that book as it will help you to hone your instincts on networking to "stars". I'll leave you with this nugget: Star people form networks that transcend corporate hierarchal networks. 

Sorry, your Dad! </TEXT>

In my experience, engineering students are a pretty cool lot. 

You can go a more traditional route, but my gut says your likelihood of seeing this through to fruition will diminish in proportion to the encumbrance that accompanies the traditional route.

There is no right or wrong, however. The beauty of embarking on your adventure is that it is your call.  </TEXT>

I bought this domain a few years ago. I want to monetize it. To be clear, my goal is not to make a fortune. It is simply to start building practical knowledge. Right now, I am overwhelmed by the myriad of books and tools at one's disposal in the world of web development and e-commerce. I am seeking the bare minimum that it will take to make it generate revenue and a profit, however small. I've heard it's possible to create a landing page and place ads onto it, and am curious as to whether this is the way to go. Any help is appreciated.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We own a payroll company. We do a ton of emailing, both domestic and abroad. Suddenly a significant number of our emails are getting returned to us as undeliverable, along with a securenet "suspected spam" message. 

I've replied to the "prove I'm not a spammer" link and supplied copies of messages as per the request. 

I've called GoDaddy twice. They at first told me I'm not blacklisted and suggested we remove hyperlinks from emails, check for mis-spellings, and remove our JPEG signature logo. We did. No improvement. I called again and got an IT guy to admit he can't discern whether we are blacklisted or not. He said he was escalating it to a higher tech. That was a week ago. I email the tech for an update every day. No response. 

I'll add that our IT department isolated this as a Godaddy issue. They contacted GoDaddy prior to my involvement. They struck out. Frustrated, I took over. 

This problem started two weeks ago. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!
