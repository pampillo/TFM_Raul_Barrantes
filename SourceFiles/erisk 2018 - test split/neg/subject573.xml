<TEXT>  I hold three patents because of the latter. I couldn't tell you exactly what the patent covers, after the lawyers got through describing my invention (and the patent office got through cutting half the claims, because the lawyers tried the most aggressive possible claims). I certainly couldn't tell you whether someone's already invented itthe thorough investigation isn't worth doing unless a lawsuit materializes.

According to the [USPTO](https://www.uspto.gov/patents-getting-started/patent-basics/types-patent-applications/nonprovisional-utility-patent#heading-21), to receive a patent one must have stated a belief of being the original inventor.

Each inventor must sign an oath or declaration that includes certain statements required by law and the USPTO rules, including the statement that he or she believes himself or herself to be the original inventor or an original joint inventor of a claimed invention in the application, and the statement that the application was made or authorized to be made by him or her.

<TEXT> Thank you for the links. I'll try to go on a tour when I'm in the area.

There seems to be a huge discrepancy in the Daily Beast reporting. About $20,000,000 was reportedly raised by 2011, but the Propublica accounting lists only about $4,700,000 in total assets with only $11,000 in contributions that year. Also, the 2011 email indicates that someone was going to donate $1,000,000. Propublica shows no year where revenue exceeded $600,000 or contributions exceeding $30,000.

Maybe we are looking at the wrong thing? </TEXT>

CoP didn't go into detail about the praise. I'm not sure what it was related to.

And I assume you're referring to donations that went to fund the Diplomatic Reception Rooms?

I don't know what the donations would have been for. I did a search for "Endowment 8th floor", but couldn't find anything.

The Reception Rooms don't use taxpayer dollars but instead rely on donations for their preservation   upkeep.

Interesting. Do you know if the Rooms are open to the public? Do you know where to find the donation accounting and preservation/upkeep expenses? I couldn't find it on that site. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's definitely achievable. I'm trying to calculate out a reasonable bound on the problem.

One way to bring down the requirements is to assume less transactions (maybe you convert into a local currency once a month?).

    10,000,000,000 * 250 bytes / 30 days ~= 7.7 Mbps

    10,000,000,000 * 250 bytes / 30 / 144 ~= 579 MB blocks </TEXT>

If 300k is the theoretical limit, why are we using 1MB right now? If transactions were cut to a third of current traffic, that would further limit the network unless the rate of block production was increased. If 300k blocks came out every minute (on average), we could have a threefold increase in current capacity? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Limiting the problem to only contain clauses that use all variables takes it out of the class of NP-complete problems in fact it takes it out of the class of NP problems.

Can you explain in more technical detail? What class of problem is a fully qualified CNF statement?

That is not what the pdf says. If you think it is 1 you have read it wrong.

I think page 2 may contain errors. The subscript labels seem off for one (the first page uses 0-index, the second uses 1-index).

If you compute c0 for `a v b v c v d` by the rules on page 1, you get `0`, then 2^0 = `1`. The choice of 0 vs 1 is arbitrary, so I believe there should be a second understanding.

What do you mean?

It would be 22n-1. You can check his example for the case of n=4. His first clause is a v b v c v d and he gets 215 = 224-1.

I actually think it is `1`. `c0` will evaluate to `0` and then you are left with `2^0 = 1`. `1` in binary is `1`, so you look up the first entry of the appropriate truth table and get that all assignments except `a=false,b=false,c=false,d=false` satisfy the input statement.

<TEXT>  The example only has 4 variables, yet his result is 1000010000001000.

The result tells you that the 1^st, 6^th, and 13^th entries of a truth table with 4 variables do not satisfy the input statement. All other entries in the truth table are satisfying assignments. You can extract the assignments by treating the index as a binary number and looking at the positions of bits.

The first example they give does not include only full CNF clauses.

They are just using a shorthand notation then.

I'm not sure what that is even supposed to mean.
If there is 1 clause of the form (a_1 v a_2 v ... v a_n) with all variables positive. The input is n bits. 

The size of the problems are `m * n` where `m` is the number of clauses and `n` is the number of variables. In your case, there is only 1 clause, so `m = 1` and the input size is `1 * n`.

Now what is the associated number of that clause?

I believe it would be 0, but I'm not 100% sure at the moment. </TEXT>

My understanding of the pdf is that a result of `1` corresponds to an assignment `a=false`.

Where does the ""paper"" say that I mustn't or how to handle redundant statements?

You are referring to the pdf? I think it is in the definition of the problem. Redundant clauses should all be assigned the same subscript labeling.

That is definitely not the SAT problem. I'm not sure what else you could mean.

I think it is the 'SAT problem'. Can you give an alternative definition? The input is a fully qualified CNF statement.

The fact that I can write that derivation down from the top of my head is a very good indicator that it is indeed both.

Not so hard, once you read it.

I'm not sure how that is supposed to not be at least an exponential amount of memory.

The input is O(m*n). </TEXT>

<TEXT>  This just tells me that the output of the formula doesn't actually tell me if the SAT is solvable.

Page 2 of the pdf gives the correspondence between the output and the satisfying assignments.

It yields 2n+1-1 if the SAT is not satisfiable. 

Perhaps. I may be off by some number of ones. I haven't calculated it out recently.

It doesn't tell us anything new.

Where was that told to us before?

All he's done [...]

You also have to invert the bits.

Shouldn't the simplified form and the longer form yield the same result? Because they don't.

Why should they? Should you be passing redundant statements?

The important bit here is that in his version every clause has to use all variables.

That is the problem.

No.

Well, your result is not trivial or boring. If it was, I imagine you could have linked or copied the result from some other triviality generator.

It is however impressive that your algorithm is using O(2n) space (and hence time) with n being the number of variables when O(m*log(m)) with m being the number of clauses is easily enough.

I'm not sure which algorithm you're talking about at this point, but I believe my algorithm only requires O(min( m, 2^n )) space. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The formula is not mine. The author apparently claims to have copyright on it, but I don't believe formulae can be copyright.

Now your formula will yield 2^0 =1 - FALSE. But clearly this formula has the solution a=FALSE.

I don't see the problem. You are saying the formula yielded a solution?

Or does your formula say nothing about the solvability directly and only tells me about which configurations solve the problem?

Again, it's not my fomula. I think the formula says a lot of things. It gives a correspondence between CNF and arithmetic. It implies algorithms to solve a large class of problems. I believe the formula yields 2^n when the equivalent satisfiability problem is unsatisfiable.


Or does your formula say nothing about the solvability directly and only tells me about which configurations solve the problem? In that case I present to you (~a) ^ (~a) ^ (~a) which according to your formula yields 20 + 20 + 20 =3 -  FALSE, FALSE

It's not my formula. Your case can be simplified to just `~a`.

Or does your formula only apply to full CNFs without repeats?

Not my formula. I believe the SAT problem only refers to CNFs.

That result is pretty trivial and boring.

If you're actually interested in this stuff I recommend you go read some of the basic theory first, then start to look at state of the art SAT solvers (the DPLL algorithm might be a good place to start before you get caught up with recent contributions).

I don't know if equations have points. The author may have one.

Again, the paper doesn't say what the equation is intended for.

What paper does? Why is this worth repeating?


It seems to me to show how arithmetic can be related to something like `SAT(v0,...,vn-1|c0,...,cm-1)` . Was this a widely known relationship?

But for it to mean anything, the paper needs to address how this can be applied to whatever general problem it is trying to solve.

May papers only be complete if they address a general problem?

The example I have is actually very relevant because my example is exactly the article you posted

But, it wasn't. This paper is based on past data. It's not something you can actually create a control for and then observe over time. All you can do is compare the past data.

What I think needs to be done is the same basic query, but comparing across *all* groupings.

Also, I don't think anyone has claimed that seeing an anomaly in one group *must mean* that there is a connection. However, *if* there is a connection, you would expect to see anomalies.  </TEXT>

That's what you proposed: an experimental control where Kate would slap Dave in the face as hard as she could, to see if her computer turning on was related to a fire alarm going off.

It's in no way comparable to this study, which appears to essentially be an SQL query on an insurance database.

It's pretty obvious you believe their results and that's your prerogative.

I don't know why you think you know what I believe. I don't even trust that the numbers they reported are correct to the computations they performed (or even to what they claimed to perform). </TEXT>

<TEXT>  If you look at the data, it shows that they chose patients who were diagnosed with specific disorders and determined the percentage of those patients who got vaccinated 6 months prior which is exactly what I was saying.

If you look at the methods, it describes a different selection process.

There are other ways to examine the data. This is just one way.

The reason this is so important is because it maintains all the variables.

One can't know what all the variables are, much less maintain them.

Your example doesn't work in this case, because there is no connection between slapping someone (doesn't sound like an ethical experiment to me), and turning on a computer.

In this study, the groups are linked through vaccinations. You are also talking about an (violent) intervention, where this study was completely observational. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "What" is implying that? The article calls out the Sessions issue as being different, but does draw an equivalency with McCaskill:

**Pelosi's explanation is similar to one offered by Sen. Claire McCaskill** Thursday, after she swiped at Attorney General Jeff Sessions for privately meeting with Kislyak in 2016 and failing to disclose it when asked about communications with Russians during his confirmation proceedings in January. Sessions has emphasized that meetings with ambassadors are common for lawmakers and that he met with Kislyak in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

**McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, tweeted that in her 10 years on the Armed Services Committee, she had received "No call or meeting w/Russian ambassador. Ever."**

**But after confronted with a pair of her own tweets from 2013 and 2015 in which she described a meeting and call with Kislyak, McCaskill walked back her comment.** </TEXT>

I don't see where it says only diagnosed patients were selected (in fact, two other conditions were selected: broken bones and open wounds). Is that the only way to get into the claims data?

If vaccinations have no impact on neuropsychiatric diagnoses, then the background vaccination rate (over the studied time periods) should be similar to any other arbitrary grouping. This study seems to show a higher incidence of vaccinations in some diagnosis groups. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  What they should have done is take the total number of people vaccinated in a certain time period and determine whether or not they developed the disorder.

My understanding is that is actually what they did.

The start of Methods: 

Using claims data, we compared the prior years occurrence of vaccinations...

So, first they selected the vaccination data, then the neuropsychiatric disorders data:

...with the above neuropsychiatric disorders that were newly diagnosed between January 2002 and December 2007...

Then, control conditions were selected:

...as well as two control conditions, broken bones and open wounds...

Various factors were then also controlled for:

 Subjects were matched with controls according to age, gender, geographical area, and seasonality.

You said:

Age was not controlled for. They used any patient between the ages of 6-15. If they were to control for age, then they would compare the 6 year olds with the 6 year olds and the 7 year olds with the 7 year olds etc. because to control for something means that it no longer becomes a variable. 

I haven't found the actual code used to run the analysis. We can't really be sure exactly what they did, but this is my current understanding of what the paper says. </TEXT>

The study wasn't about no vaccinations at all (is that even legal?). It was about vaccinations within a 3, 6, 12 month prior time frame of a medical diagnosis.

The only way to do this sort of experiment and draw any meaningful conclusion would be to look at the total population of vaccinated people and see how many of them were diagnosed with the disorder 6 months after receiving a vaccination. This is not what they did.

According to the article, that appears to be exactly what they did, though the total population was limited to those who had claims existing in some database. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 3-, 6-, and 12-month vaccination ranges were checked.

What they should have done is taken a population of people who were vaccinated 6 months prior to determine the percentage of people who were diagnosed with the disorder and compared it to a population of people who were never vaccinated.

I think that's exactly what they did; from the Methods:

Using claims data, we compared the prior years **occurrence of vaccinations** in children and adolescents aged 615 years with the above neuropsychiatric disorders that were newly diagnosed between January 2002 and December 2007, as well as two control conditions, broken bones and open wounds.

The comparison is on *how many kids were vaccinated (within the past 3, 6, 12 month time periods) that were in the category vs. how many kids were not vaccinated (within the past 3, 6, 12 month time periods)*.

I read the paper and they did not compare a vaccinated group and a non-vaccinated group. They compared percentage of people diagnosed with the disorder who were vaccinated 6 months prior.

I don't see a percentage of people diagnosed with a disorder anywhere, though, I don't think the data files were released. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The post you responded to linked you to the figure that shows vaccination rates. Take another look: http://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/225946/fpsyt-08-00003-HTML/image_m/fpsyt-08-00003-t001.jpg


I know this is probably hard to understand

Rule 2

but open wound percentages and broken bone percentages are not comparable to anorexia since they are completely unrelated.

Where were these percentages compared? Vaccination rates between groups was compared, is my understanding.


Who gets anorexia? Who are more likely to get broken bones? Anorexia is more prevalent in girls between the ages of 10-18 (study only goes to 15, I think, so out of their population 10-15). During this time, most people are getting lots of vaccinations as they transition from middle school to high school. So it's likely that, no matter when they got diagnosed, they had a vaccination fairly recently

6-15 were the age ranges. Gender, age, geographic area, and seasonality were controlled for:

Subjects were matched with controls according to age, gender, geographical area, and seasonality.

Where are these people from? Different parts of the country have different lifestyles and would be more susceptible to different things. There are so many factors which play a role in each of these things that saying the percentage for one is different than the other is an incorrect because almost nothing is controlled.

See above


Doing science is not just looking at percentages. If you don't control your variables properly, your data is meaningless. Like I've said, **you have to compare people who were vaccinated to people who were not vaccinated, which they did not do**. Broken bones and open wounds are irrelevant. A properly controlled study would have been as follows:

That's the percentage. The percentage *is* the comparison. ~21% of those with anorexia had a recent vaccination. ~79% of those with anorexia did not.

A) Percentage of people who were vaccinated and got OCD vs. percentage of people were were NOT vaccinated and got OCD. B) Percentage of people who were vaccinated and got anorexia vs. percentage of people were were NOT vaccinated and got anorexia. C) Percentage of people who were vaccinated and got tic disorder vs. percentage of people were were NOT vaccinated and got tic disorder. D) Percentage of people who were vaccinated and got ADHD vs. percentage of people were were NOT vaccinated and got ADHD. E) Percentage of people who were vaccinated and got depression vs. percentage of people were were NOT vaccinated and got depression. F) Percentage of people who were vaccinated and got bipolar disorder vs. percentage of people were were NOT vaccinated and got bipolar disorder.

That's my understanding of what they did:

First, **the proportion of children who were exposed to vaccines in the period before the index date was compared across the case and control groups**. Next, bivariate conditional logistic regression models were estimated to determine the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) associated with the effect of vaccine exposure on having the condition of interest. Separate models were run for the 3-, 6-, and 12-month periods preceding the index date for each diagnostic group.

Notice how I left out "broken bones" and "open wounds" because they are completely unnecessary and irrelevant.

Those are basically control groups. If vaccines have no effect on health, all arbitrary groups should be about the same. The finding is that vaccination occurred more often in some groups.

Also, you can not look at the percentage of people who got the disease and were vaccinated since almost everyone is vaccinated and that will inflate your percentages, you have to look at the people who were vaccinated and got disease. What they did is essentially like those people who say that, out of 100 heroin addicts, 99, or whatever, got vaccinated so heroin addiction is related to vaccination.

None of the percentages were close to 99%. </TEXT>

Only about 21% of the children with Anorexia had a recent vaccination. Compare that vaccination rate to 12% for those with a broken bone and about 10% for those with an open wound. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I don't see how you can say that there is an increase

"Increase" may not be the most apt term, but I think it is valid based on the first sentence of the article's (in the journal, not Yale Daily News) results:

Subjects with newly diagnosed AN were *more likely than controls to have had any vaccination* in the previous 3 months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.212.68].

If there were no link between anorexia and recent vaccinations, you would expect the anorexia group to have roughly the same vaccination rate as other groups that aren't linked to vaccinations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Bitcoin Unlimited](https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/) sounds way better:

Every node operator or miner can currently choose their own blocksize limit by modifying their client. Bitcoin Unlimited makes the process easier by providing a configurable option for the accepted and generated blocksize via a GUI menu. Bitcoin Unlimited further provides a user-configurable failsafe setting allowing you to accept a block larger than your maximum accepted blocksize if it reaches a certain number of blocks deep in the chain.

By moving the blocksize limit from the protocol layer to the transport layer, **Bitcoin Unlimited removes the only point of central control in the Bitcoin economy - the blocksize limit - and returns it to the nodes and the miners**. An emergent consensus will thus arise based on free-market economics as the nodes/miners converge on consensus focal points, creating in the process a living, breathing entity that responds to changing real-world conditions in a free and decentralised manner. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  On that topic, though, **the one thing about Bitcoin that seems really crazy to me is the idea that every transaction**, whether it's a real estate sale or a $1 wallet reorganization, **has to be kept track of forever by everyone participating in the system at the node level**. Even if bandwidth and storage were unlimited, it just seems wasteful.

Every transaction does not need to be kept track of forever. [Please see section 7 of the Bitcoin paper, "Reclaiming Disk Space"](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf):


Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before
it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash,
transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash.
Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do
not need to be stored.


A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are
generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = **4.2MB per year**. With computer systems
typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of
1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in
memory.

<TEXT> You should have no merge conflicts on either Dev-Test or Test-Prod. If something fails on either of those merges, something went terribly wrong.

All integration needs to happen in Dev or earlier.

People shouldn't be regularly working in the same file. Why are they? If they are working in different parts of the file, you probably need to split the code into more files. If they are working in the same functions, you probably need to split the functions into smaller ones.

It might make sense to keep different repos for different clients (it might also make sense to keep it all in one) and to rely on well-versioned artifacts to deal with different clients running different versions of shared code.

All code should flow in one direction only. Code should not be manually committed to Test or Prod. Code should be (semi-, if you need)auto pushed to Test and Prod as part of a scripted build/deploy pipeline. </TEXT>

Can you link to a specific claim from the CIA or FBI that the dnc-emails and/or podesta-emails sections of WikiLeaks' website contain information delivered to them on behalf of Russia?

A real individual has already claimed to have had legal access to dnc-emails and that they leaked them.

podesta-emails may have been phished, or just brute-forced (weak password). It could have been done by just about anyone.

<TEXT> Clinton's emails are implicated in a criminal investigation.

Letter Text:

Dear Messrs. Chairmen: 

I write to supplement my October 28, 2016 letter that notified you the FBI would be taking additional investigative steps with respect to former Secretary of State Clinton's use of a personal email server. Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review *a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation*. During that process, we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State.

Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton. 

I am very grateful to the professionals at the FBI for doing an extraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short period of time.

Sincerely yours, 

James B. Comey

Director

I have not read every email. I have spent hours (5-10+ probably) searching through the DNC, Podesta, AKP, and possibly other archives. I have reported on many of my findings.


And then you posted a link to a damn youtube video.

So, you haven't watched it.


 Goddamnit, this is why we ended up with Trump as President- we're in a post-fact world.

Yep. With Hillary we likely would have been "factless". At least we are picking up the pieces now.

 The truth doesn't matter- all that matter is how someone else interpreted the truth for you.

The truth might be the only thing of matter.

Russia has probably gotten material off machines in the US that someone didn't want them to. Wikileaks has seemingly published many leaks and the statement you linked to was just not specific at all.

I am sorry they did not issue a specific statement on one specific email you are referencing. I am sure you know more than our intelligence operations. You should point that out to them, they could use your assistance.

<TEXT> Have you read Wikipedia's article on Reagan?

 Television
Though an early critic of television, Reagan landed fewer film roles in the late 1950s and decided to join the medium.[26] He was hired as the host of General Electric Theater, a series of weekly dramas that became very popular.[26] His contract required him to tour GE plants sixteen weeks out of the year, often demanding of him fourteen speeches per day.[26] He earned approximately $125,000 per year (about $1.07 million in 2010 dollars) in this role. The show ran for ten seasons from 1953 to 1962 and, as a result it increased Reagan's profile in American households,[49] especially as he had appeared in feature films mostly in supporting role or as a "second lead".
His final work as a professional actor was as host and performer from 1964 to 1965 on the television series Death Valley Days.[50]
Reagan and Nancy Davis appeared together on television several times, including an episode of General Electric Theater in 1958 called "A Turkey for the President."[51]

I think I've noticed some hiccups while clicking a lot, but I think the drones usually all came out in around 22ish clicks.

I usually keep my mouse near my targets, but to stop, I have to get my mouse nearly directly on my ship and the speed change gradient is too small to be easily useful. </TEXT>

That is the same scene, but without the sphere wrapping (I also reduced the size of the points so that you can better see the structure). You can edit the OP scene by setting `bend={0}` to get the same thing (with the original point size).

The points lie on an XY plane, where a point is filled if `X MOD Y == 0`, or, where X can be evenly divided by Y. More technically, the points lie on the `Z == 1` plane if `Y` is a factor of `X` and on the `Z == 2` plane if `Y` is a factor of `2X`, and more generally, on the `Z == w` plane if `Y` is a factor of `w * X`. All the scenes linked so far only show you the `Z == 1` plane.

Another way you can think of this: Draw lines of slope `1`, `1/2`, `1/3`, `1/4`, etc. and only keep the points that lie on integer coordinates. </TEXT>

 In all cases, except for times when an "Accident Alert" has been declared, you must stop and report the crash to the local police agency by calling your local district police station or 911.

I don't believe an "Accident Alert" had been declared. I could be wrong though.

<TEXT> It might be just a fine if that was the only wrong that occurred here, but there is also:

Failing to stop at a stop sign.

Failing to yield to a pedestrian.

Stopping in a crosswalk.

Unloading in the middle of a crosswalk.

Fleeing the scene of an accident.

(Possibly) hitting a pedestrian.

Abuse of horn.


All of those may add up to enough to suspend a license even without prior offenses. Just from watching the video though, you can see the driver has no business being on the road. </TEXT>

Also, there are just ballots that haven't been counted. So, yeah, I don't know what you or the person I responded to are talking about. </TEXT>

The article seems to establish its own (but conflicting) racial hierarchy.

On one hand, non-white is upheld as delivering praise to white boys (particularly if they are fuck boys), but on the other, she believes that everyone sees her as inferior to white women, *because a white fuck boy said he felt bad about having sexual contact with her, due to another relationship, and because he was not exciting enough*.

Commenters have claimed that reading a handful of words gave insight into a very specific mindset of an individual they otherwise know nothing about.

Now, you are saying that the very particular mindset that was described was not accurate?

Either the commenters 'knew' he was afraid, or they didn't.

I argued it is impossible for us to know that. Others say we can know it solely from the words used.

<TEXT> I didnt waste my time trying to be nice anymore because I was aware of what I had become: the irrelevant Asian girl in a budding Scott Pilgrim-esque romance. From the countless times that Ive been rejected for a white girl, Ive been taught that my desirability was only a fleeting moment whereas a white girl was the one worth getting to know, the one worth bringing home to parents and the one worth being treated as a human. I was the sexual object, whereas my housemate was the one who had feelings worth considering.

Eventually, I showed Sam out the door, and he asked for my number, suggesting that maybe we could hang out next semester when our lives were a little bit different.

Fuck that. Im wise enoughor have been fooled enough timesto recognize that this maybe one day trope was a fuckboy specialty. To objectify women like theyre library books, pulling them on and off the shelf whenever its convenientand for women to be OK with thatis a clear example of male privilege.

Its depressing to realize how much women of color compromise in their relationships with white men. I recall the number of times that my non-white girlfriends and I have praised a white guy for having listened to us, for having genuine interest in us, for seeing us as a real people instead of objects. Its fucked up that these are exceptions and not expectations.

When society has made the white person the ultimate pursuit, it teaches non-white women to be OK with feeling inferior, to be OK with being submissive and to be OK with being treated like shit.

Until white boys prove to me theyre worth more than a faded fuck, I refuse to take these fuckboys seriously anymore.

<TEXT> The assumption of a contract is that it is valid. UC might refer to something as a "contract", but that does not make it the case.

UC has a history of violating the CA (and US) Constitution, so it would not be the least bit surprising if it is currently violating either. Cf. Regents v. Bakke

I don't see anything in the policy you pasted that says anything about speech. It seems to be only referring to physical violence/coercion. UC is strictly forbidden from making any contract, rule, policy, or other law that restrains or abridges liberty of speech.

<TEXT> Did I claim UC operates within the Constitution? No.

Here is the relevant bit:

Article 1. Section 2 (a)

Every person may freely speak, write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of this right. A law may not restrain or abridge liberty of speech or press.

You seem to have trouble comprehending.

I said:


*MBTI depends on a written, English questionnaire*, so it already starts out terribly confounded.

*It also regularly categorizes me into two different groups.* There may be some vague concept of personality that can be discussed, but I'd guess those are cultural (eg. daughters taught to seek a husband or sons taught how to fight). I don't think anyone has or can give a scientifically understandable concept of personality. They are largely subjective theories interpreted by their adherents.

What more data do you want?

Holy shit, I don't even know why I attempted to engage in intellectual discussion with you. Stay classy and never change. God knows no amount of reality is gonna change your opinion anyway. 

Yes. Classy.

<TEXT> Their upvotes now outweight their downvotes.

I don't see how the contents of the article or your comments were missed. Their comment *directly* addresses your claim.

Any two people will not perform identically, so your crazy thought is redundant. We can already know that two interviewees will not be identical, without even having to consider their gender (which means, even same-gendered pairs will not be identical). So, gender's not "all there is to it". In fact, what seems to be "to it" is simply that you are comparing two different individuals.


Saying 'no there's no gender differences, there's only PEOPLE differences' is beyond stupid and ignores evidence that all sides of this debate agree on

I don't see anyone here that said that.

The topic of this discussion is precisely that that are gender differences. That's an indisputable fact even if there's disagreement on where those differences come from.

You have me curious now, what are the differences (besides definitional: chromosomes, genitalia, etc)? </TEXT>

It binds to the deploy phase by default and uploads all of the applications dependencies to S3 individually. On paper this actually makes the build slower, but the trick is that it only needs to do this if the dependency doesnt already exist in S3.

    Mashed (refried) black beans (salt)
    Wild rice (cumin, chili, tomato)

    Saute:
    Cooked lentils
    Cooked green garbanzo beans
    Tomato
    Oil

    Make salsa:
    Tomato
    Onion
    Garlic
    Cilantro
    Lime
    Chili pepper
    Salt
    Pepper

    Warm a tortilla, then stuff it full of the above and some sliced avocado. You can add some cheese if you'd like. Eat with chips and salsa, and fruit.

The developer also didn't say the offer was timed-exclusive, and I'd argue that it was implied that FB/Oculus was offering to buy the game outright, or at least for indefinite exclusivity.

That said, timed-exclusive is still exclusive.

I'm curious to know more specs on the shitton of money that FB/Oculus offered for six months of exclusivity. How do they they think that helps anyone?

<TEXT> Tesla's PR is also just another department that ignores directly answering an inquiry, but pushes propaganda instead:

Response from Tesla

Tesla proudly employs nearly 6,000 American workers from the Bay Area on the floor of the same factory that had previously been shuttered by NUMMI. These are well-paying jobs, each of which comes with equity in Tesla, and which have helped to transform the automotive industry and revitalize this region's important role in it. Separate from its thousands of employees, Tesla sometimes brings in third party general contractors to do short-term construction projects at the factory where Tesla does not have the expertise or ability to do the project on its own. In these situations, Tesla enters into contractual agreements with its general contractors, which allow them to select the resources they need for the job while also requiring them to hire and pay their workers appropriately.

Or should we be taking this to read that Tesla will resolve this situation by paying all back wages ASAP?

Edit: [Looks like Tesla is investigating and will "ensure that the right thing happens and all are treated fairly".](https://www.teslamotors.com/blog/response-mercury-news-article-hidden-workforce-expanding-teslas-factory)

<TEXT> I don't know of a service that does this. I would expect to be able to see a real-time count of total resources used system-wide and a real-time count of the resources I used. I could then verify and compute my own costs.

As I imagine it, my actual billed costs should be less (perhaps, much less) than the guaranteed cost, so that should always be a pleasant bonus.

For billing, I think I would want to be able to lock-in a maximum rate for a fixed amount of time. I should be able to move to a new lock-in at any time (not sure about how this could affect the model, but seems reasonable). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I voted for resource billing rounded up to 10 minutes and wanted to post an "other" here in case that it might provoke some discussion. (also, it was getting to be too hard to edit my post in the very small box that I was given to put it in)

I would be interested in billing that pooled the resource costs (say, every vendor billing period) and then allocated them proportionally to my resource usage relative to all other users. This would incentivize the business to highly value efficient resource usage.

You would need to track actual resource usage per application. Idle CPU time and unused storage would be billed equally (or, perhaps, proportionally to actual usage) to all users. The business would need to keep billings for idle resources low, and, as a user, I would feel that I have a fair, collective-ownership of the resources I'm paying for. If the business could attract enough users, efficient usage of resources would make costs very low for lightweight users and heavy users are billed accordingly. Low costs are likely to attract more users, some of which may convert to heavy users, continuing the cycle.

As a user, I would want to be guaranteed a maximum billing for a particular level of resource usage. The business would need to figure out how to calculate what the maximum costs would be for particular time frames, but I think it is possible (to some degree of risk). </TEXT>

 input.reduce((o, {id, tags}) = tags.map(t = o[t] = (o[t] || []).concat(id))    o, {})

To lodash, for OP:

 _.transform(input, (o, {id, tags}) = _.map(tags, t = o[t] = (o[t] || []).concat(id))    o)

If you can count on `tags` being an Array (and are running with JS 1.6 or newer), you can use the built-in `map`.
 _.transform(input, (o, {id, tags}) = tags.map(t = o[t] = (o[t] || []).concat(id))    o)

_.transform is like reduce, but will implicitly create your accumulator as a new `{}`, if you don't specify it.

You can hoist those functions to a higher namespace and add additional parameters, but you eventually end up having to replicate something similar to prototypes to have the equivalent semantics as prototypes.

I don't ever want to use `this` in my code either. It sucks. You could add a com/trans-piler step that adds in `this.` for you though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a good heuristic to go with the "existing (superior) solution" (we are trying to solve things, right?), but it shouldn't be applied as an absolute rule and you certainly shouldn't think that people are smarter than you. The basic problem is that it is near impossible to evaluate at every level of your stack what the optimal existing solution is. You may be able to do it for some well designed specifications, but in general, you won't have sufficient specifications, nor the resources to perform the extensive calculations that would be required to determine the absolute optimum.

Everything hasn't been done and it's very likely that there are better to solutions to most problems and the faster you get to them, the more you benefit. </TEXT>

I use (Fedora 24) the following command to setup the gamepad:

    $ xboxdrv \
      --mouse \
      --ui-axismap X1=ABS_X,Y1=ABS_Y,X1^resp:-2000:0:2000,Y1^resp:-5000:0:5000 \
      --no-extra-devices \
      --trigger-as-button \
      --detach-kernel-driver

You'll need your gamepad hooked up and the `xboxdrv` program. The axismap starts your cursor in the middle of your screen and the resp filters keep the mouse cursor in a small box around your snake. You may need to try the values that are best for you.

<TEXT> I made my first millions along with thousands of other kids at Microsoft working 120hrs/wk for years.  It was a big sacrifice.

Let's say three million to be at the most conservative end. Let's also assume that the three million is what has been retained at the end of years (7?), so, we allow that a standard $200k salary + benefits all go to personal expenses -- we are just looking for the marginal salary you would need to end up with three million after seven years of 120hrs/wk work at Microsoft.

That's a bit more than $400k/year in additional salary. I would guess you'd need to factor in some raises over the years (maybe the final year's salary was $1.2m, for example), or, perhaps, Microsoft signs thousands of kids at 7-year $600k+benefits/year contracts? </TEXT>

Non-disclosure agreements stop you from speaking.

Not really. You can make an agreement with someone that you won't say something, but nothing short of altering your body to make you physically incapable of communication or your own free will, can prevent you from ever speaking about it.

Wikipedia's page on "Freedom of Speech in the United States" literally has an entire section on the limitations on free speech in the US. 

Wikipedia also literally has an entire *page* on [Prior Restraint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_restraint) and a whole section on it's status in the United States.

If you really don't think that anyone can stop you from speaking, you might want to take that up with the government directly, because they don't seem to particularly agree with you on that one.

It also pertains to things relevant to national security. If the law decides something isn't covered and its confirmed by the courts, then its legal by this countries rules.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_restraint

Its quite possible to pass a law that says 'you cant talk bad about the whig political party' and if the courts confirm it then its a-ok. 

Courts have already denied this.

Though realistically no sane politician would go that far to vote for it, or a president likely confirm it, nor would a Judge likely forgo his expected duty so blatantly. Lastly people wouldn't collectively vote in people for so many years that the judges and majority of house and senate and the president all be O.K with something like censorship in law.

Ok, so, what, we are talking about "no[t] sane" stuff now?

Look, no one can stop you from speaking. reddit can't say whether or not the government has done something to them? hunh? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not a hostage situation. Contrary to the article, ES2015/6/7/8/JavaScript is a decent enough language. Yes, other languages do some things better, and yes, if you don't know about types and many of the other features of the languages that do some things better, you are most likely eventually going to have a very rough time with your code.

The big draw of Javascript is the platform availability. It is unprecedented in users and machines.

If you know what to avoid, you can do some pretty cool things in the language that would take much longer in many other commonly used languages. The problem is that we don't know all of the things to avoid and probably never will. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you should be realistic about your skills with a particular tool and try to get better (including finding and using new tools). My first experience with relational DB's (MySQL) was as just a use for persistence. I'm not even sure I knew that MySQL was "relational"; I just knew it was a database and that it could persist a user's (game player) data between sessions. I never finished the project (was just working on a prototype mmorpg :]) as was mostly expected, but I did get some insight into the idea of databases in general (as a persistence of data mechanism), how it could be useful, and also how to implement a (very trivial compared to what I can produce today) working project.

When I later took a formal course on relational databases, it was quite easy, I believe, because of my prior experience. Everything just made sense; I could see how the things I was learning filled in the knowledge that I had previously lacked when trying to use such a database.

You probably can't learn everything there is to learn in one continuous go at it. Things you learn on one project can be used to learn more things on other projects. If you are learning something new, don't expect to be able to wield your new tool as successfully as others at first, but don't let that stop you from practicing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, prior to this incident, npm policy (and likely code) was that this behavior was not allowed. NPM broke their API contract.

NPM allows users to control their packages and to do with them as they wish. Azer told NPM what his desire was by using NPM's unpublish functionality and NPM's software did what it was supposed to do.

NPM didn't like the result of Azer's legitimate action, so they effectively reversed his action, by un-un-publishing the exact package that Azer told them to remove.

NPM has pretty much 0 credibility at this point. Now we know that NPM will jack your package contrary to their policies (no reasonable discussion among the parties took place according to the parties' accounts), and that they may arbitrarily decide to override documented APIs whenever they feel like it.

On top of all that the `kik` package that was jacked currently has no usable code in it and is being squat (contrary to NPM's written policies) by NPM itself instead of containing KIK's important package they they claimed they needed the name for. </TEXT>

**[It's insulting that KIK|Bob wants an [actively developed](https://github.com/starters/kik/commits/master) project to give up its name for their *unreleased package*, but whatever, worse things occur in the world.]**

Azer:
Sorry, Im building an open source project with that name.

KIK|Bob:
We dont mean to be a dick about it **[Is this language really called for?]**, but **[Ah, here comes the inevitable exception to the "don't try to be a dick" rule.]** its a registered Trademark in most countries around the world **[*KIK|Bob whips dick out*]** and if you actually release an open source project called kik, **our trademark lawyers are going to be banging on your door and taking down your accounts and stuff like that  and wed have no choice but to do all that because you have to enforce trademarks or you lose them.** ***[KIK|Bob threatens to send their mercenaries to Azer's house to make a whole bunch of noise about Azer's use of "kik" and deliberately interfere with Azer's network use]* [WHAT!?]**

Can we not come to some sort of a compromise to get you to change the name without involving lawyers? Is there something we could do for you in compensation to get you to change the name? **[...Like, refactor Azer's project to replace all references to his kik project with some other name?]**

Bob Stratton

**[Um, wow? I don't think any professional email can start off with "We don't mean to be a dick about it", but the ", but ..." makes this instance even more heinous. ]**

Azer:
hahah, youre actually being a dick. so, fuck you. dont e-mail me back.

KIK|Bob-NPM;cc-Azer:
OK, so it doesnt seem to be possible to resolve this amicably. Can you guys help?

Bob Stratton

**[Is this a cold email? What is "it"? And, "this"? KIK|Bob is either assuming NPM has incredible time to spend deciphering the email chain he forwarded to them, or they have had prior contact.]**

KIK|Bob-Azer
Were really trying to be reasonable about this to see if we can work it out on a friendly basis. **[KIK|Bob threw out all claims to "friendly" by going directly to vulgar language and threats when his first request was denied.]** I dont know why you think that makes us a dick. **[KIK|Bob (if you are reading this), it's because *you said, "We don't mean to be a dick about it, but.."*. You classified yourself as a dick*!*]**

Is there nothing we can do for you that would compensate you for the hassle of changing the name? **[KIK|Bob could at least offer *some* example of what they could possibly do that would compensate for Azer fulfilling *their* request.]**

Bob Stratton

kik Interactive

**[Zero fault can be laid on Azer for the language he used. KIK|Bob brought that language into the conversation, *unprovoked*.]**

Azer:
Yeah, you can buy it for $30.000 for the hassle of giving up with my pet project for bunch of corporate dicks

**[*Azer responds to KIK|Bob's offer of compensation* and *KIK|Bob never responds*!]**

**banging** *v.* strike or put down (something) forcefully and noisily, typically in anger or in order to attract attention.

* make a sudden loud noise, typically repeatedly.

* (with reference to a door) open or close violently and noisily.

I believe my rhetoric is completely on-point. KIK is the user of inflammatory rhetoric. </TEXT>

Of course their policies may differ from other railways, I can only speak to what I have commonly seen.

If the platform is not public property, it must be "private" as others here have been trying (incorrectly) to argue. The problem with this argument is that there is no "private" entity to which this platform belongs (that is because it is public and owned by the state [ie. everyone]).

You can extend this method to work for any data - you just need enough random data such that the entropy of the random data is greater than the known entropy of the contents, plus the key length.

It sounds plausible, but I'm not sure.

As the original response stated:

 destroying the only known copies of a key used for encrypting

This allows you to accomplish that goal without the problem mentioned in that comment (namely brute-force attacks).

Even if you are provably safe from a brute force attack, there is no practical way to both: 1) have been able to transmit and decrypt (encryption use-case) and 2) guarantee all keys have been destroyed.

The closest would be destroying the only known copies of a key used for encrypting, but as long as you have the payload, you may eventually read the plaintext.

<TEXT> I agree that the usage is excessive. It's certainly not stealing (especially with Github actively managing the traffic; as opposed to blocking it), but the developer's reaction seems short-sighted.

<TEXT> I'm sorry about that. I hope they have accepted it by now.

Most major movies are rated by the MPAA and they will call out things like rape or other violence so that people can make a decision about whether or not they want to watch the movie. If you aren't sure about the content of what you are about to watch and are sensitive to some images and themes it might be a good idea to check out the ratings. It doesn't sound like you can trust your parents so you might want to checkout the rating everything they recommend, at least for awhile.

My more general recommendation, though, would be to watch more educational videos on the Internet and less Hollywood features. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure if the rating runs before every rated film in every format, but if you are watching in a theater you should be able to ask someone who works there what the rating of a particular movie is and the reason why it was rated that way.

More discretion from your parents sounds like it would be useful. Have you discussed this issue with them? </TEXT>

<TEXT> That movie was reviewed by the MPAA and was given a 'Restricted' (no children under 17 without a parent allowed) rating, *before widespread viewings* for, "sadistic brutal violence including a rape and disturbing images, language, nudity and some drug use".

The function of universities is to pass along knowledge, without restriction, for the benefit of the community. Removing someone from the classroom, whom is there to learn, is unconscionable and violates their academic freedoms.

Are there any solutions for easily making a watchable broadcast with this setup? I've tried Google+ Hangouts/Youtube live streaming, but it seems like with those you can either share a single window or the entire 3840x1080 desktop, which becomes pretty useless for viewing text unless the viewer has a 4k monitor.

Is there any good solution? Or do you just need to drastically reduce your development area when you are broadcasting? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems like Mitt Romney is so inept, or cynical, that by November the arguments he puts forth will be unintelligible or at the very least a constant stream of what we've been seeing in the last few weeks. 

It is fascinating to watch people attempt to rationalize his behavior and defend the things that he is saying. They keep pushing it to stupider and stupider places. 

It seems like you can detect some cracking in the facade they have built up in their minds. Little flinches, pauses here and there, as if Steve Doocy were thinking to himself, "What the fuck am I saying?".

For some reason I am extremely curious to see just how far they will take this, when and how they will figure it out, and how they will respond once they finally step into reality.

Will they just snap? Realize their mistake and apologize? Deny it forever? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Romney pays less taxes than a lot of us even though he makes much more than us. Why aren't we pissed off that he is not pulling his weight? 

He just wants to make more money at our expense. He gets taxed less and we get taxed more to make up for it.

Should we as a society allow someone who thinks they don't have to contribute as much as we all contribute to be our leader? 

This man is clearly primarily motivated by making money. He doesn't care about contributing to society in the same way we do. He will do everything he can to minimize his contribution to our common burden.

Why do we want a person like that to be our president? It doesn't make sense.


Edit: To clarify, I am talking about him paying less federal income taxes as a percentage of income than a lot of us in the United States do. </TEXT>
