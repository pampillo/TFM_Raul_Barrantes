<TITLE> ELI5 Why isn't T-Mobile violating net neutrality? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-21 12:47:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> T-Mobile doesn't charge extra data when users listen to music on certain data plans. 

Yesterday, there was an article on r/worldnews about Canada upholding net neutrality. It said,

"Differential pricing contradicts the principle of net neutrality because it allows service providers to leverage their privileged position to decide which services are most attractive to their customers, effectively discriminating against others."

So wouldn't this be a violation? </TEXT>

<TEXT> In statistics, there consists of two groups of people:

The population-- all the experimental units you are studying

The sample-- a portion of the population that represents the diversity of the population as best as possible. 

Because it is often too difficult to survey an entire population, researchers survey a portion of it (the sample) and use good statistical practices to make sure the sample represents the population.

For example, if you wonder how many freshman there are at a local college where there are 5,000 students, you can randomly assigned 100 people to take your survey. Then, if 30 people out of your 100 people are freshman, you can assume 30% of the population is freshman. 

Of course, you can easily find out the number of freshman in a college, but if it was something more complicated, like what flavor of ice cream people liked the most, you can still use this sampling method to get your results.  </TEXT>
