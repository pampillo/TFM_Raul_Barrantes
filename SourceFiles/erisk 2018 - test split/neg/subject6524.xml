<TEXT> I have a larger case with better airflow, but plan on binging on this thing hours at a time. I was planning on overclocking it a little bit and am unsure if it will need any sort of cooling. Thanks guys.

edit: thanks for all the helpful advice. Going to skip DC and just grab a cheap heatsink to play it safe. </TEXT>

[/xpost from r/buildmeapc](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildmeapc/comments/68g1mi/buying_a_new_monitor_need_help_deciding_if_i/)

I plan on using my [asus VE278H 27.0" 1920x1080 Monitor](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-VE278H-1920x1080-Back-lit-Monitor/dp/B0099XBO5E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1493568575 sr=8-1 keywords=Asus+VE278H+27.0%22+1920x1080+Monitor) which is my current monitor, as my second (assuming its VESA capable of which I have my doubts).

I dont play a lot of fast paced games. Mostly RPGS and strategy games. The Witcher and Mass Effect are about as intensive stuff I play. I play multiplayer games, but not FPS ones (a little overwatch but im not serious about it), so I am not too worried about the things a serious multiplayer gamer would need.

As of now I am thinking my money would be best spent on a top of the line ultrawide or curved 1080 with IPS and 144 hz.

This makes sense rather than getting a 4k monitor that is in my price range, right? The only ones I see that I can afford are 60 hz and standard 27 inches or so (I have been under the impression that 27" for 4k and 60 hz doesn't get as much out of it, let me know If Im wrong.)

I do want to make sure its something I will be ok with using as my main monitor for 4-5 years at least.

As of this moment I would love someone to tell me that a nice, curved ultrawide underneath my old asus would be a solid looking setup. 

 I have a GTX 1070 SC 8GB and a I7 6700 by the way if it matters. 

Thank you for the help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am putting together a battlestation. Right now, I am using a single [asus VE278H 27.0" 1920x1080 Monitor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/nsTmP6/asus-monitor-ve278h).

I am going to be buying a nice desk, and I plan on getting mounts for my monitors. 

I play mostly RPGs, so I dont mind 60 hz, which also helps my price range. 

I am open to curved, ultra wide, whatever. Just looking for advice. Even after reading and looking through loads of monitors, I just cant figure out what I should get and the setup I will have with it and my other monitor. 

I have about 500 dollars for a monitor. Could squeeze a little more if persuaded. Thanks for the help.  </TEXT>

And to take a pay cut 3 years in a row. 

I love this man.

<TEXT> ESPN had nothing but people who were already well known pats haters be the ones discussing the story for months. Their reporters left verifiably incorrect information online for months and made false statements on tv. The patriots requested they remove incorrect information on more than one occasion. Once, ESPN apologized at 2 am when no one was watching....another time their reporter waited until 4 months went by to delete his false tweets, too.

All this on top of the fact that the way they delivered the story, sensationalized to the max, along with NEVER treating brady as innocent until proven guilty....which he never even was.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It plays all the JRPGs I have found. You also can remote play your PS4 and have it connect to your PC too. I use it to play video files that are on my PC into a different room. Make sure on Persona 4 Golden that its playstation TV compatible, as that is like the only one I havent tried on pstv. Happy to help with any other questions about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's never sonething I hate enough to make me not love or enjoy a game, but all the way back to Chrono Trigger, I have always felt taken OUT of the game by it, rather than into it as intended.

I would much rather experience a story....it's one thing if a main character in a game with branching story choices is one thing, but in your average jrpg, it just ends up bothering me. 

Am I in the minority? Persona 5 made me bring this up. This game is fucking soooo good and I am loving it. But I find myself wishing the main character had more of a story for himself. I like the character so much I just feel like there is a lot of lost potential by keeping him silent. And no, this isn't my first persona game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am currently almost 2 months into a complete lifestyle change thanks to my dog Baxter and my hero Tom Brady. Im not even kidding. I was in a horrible state of depression, my diet was soda and processed foods, and I did nothing but sit down at a computer all day. 

I lost my dog after the AFC Championship game, and sunk even lower. When the Patriots got their asses handed to them for 2 and a half quarters, Im not even kidding, it was the absolute lowest moment of my entire life. 

I was watching the game alone as I usually do and I had tears in my eyes not just because of the game but just life in general and I just thought of my dog and begged for a miracle. 

And then I saw Tom Brady, the guy who has been through so much his whole life, had to battle through his name and family being dragged through the mud, people who hated him, all of that.....and seeing what he did.....it left me speechless. 

It took a few days to sink in, but when it did, I decided to make a change. I told myself I was going to get physically and mentally healthy for my dogs sake, so that I would know for sure that his life would always live on,  but I *never* would have believed myself capable of doing it without seeing what I saw in the superbowl. 

In one day, I quit cigs, switched from processesed garbage, sugar, and soda to fruits, spinach, kale, and stopped eating anything fried. I switched my coffee to green tea. I began walking every day. It took me a month to be able to jog, but I have been able to do that for a couple weeks now. I actually ended up hurting my shoulders because I tried to do too much too quickly.....because I am that motivated. Really really weird spot to reply with such a gigantic message, but I have a feeling you can relate to me. This shoulder thing is really fucking my life up at the moment, but I am staying strong because of the same reasons that have kept me going the last couple months.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No offense, but I dont think the Texans are that high on Bill's threat meter. 

Edit: So you are telling me Bill is keeping an eye on the Texans because they might get a rookie QB in the draft that will lead them to a playoff push? Come on guys....Im not debating that the Texans are a good team, nor that the Texans are a team Bill knows he could face in the playoffs. I *am* saying that Bill is not motivated to do this for acquiring information, just that he knows the two teams and coaching staffs will put together some really good practices. I perhaps simply could have worked on my tone in my original comment, and for that, sorry.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Man I am telling you, go play PPSSPP. It is 100% apparent at this point you have not. Its not standard, and like I said, many of them, like PSX, are garbage. PPSSPPs speedup is not a frameskip...its a speedup, the frams are still displayed (I believe). As I already said, its also very easy to use and implment into your control scheme. Go load up PPSSPP, take a lot at the options, then play a game and play around with the speedup. 

Then go use the speed up features of PS1 and PS2 and try to fuckin tell me they are the same.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently looked into wireless HDMI, and from what I saw, they seem to be far too unreliable.

I also was under the impression that the longer a HDMI cable goes, the weaker it becomes. 

I am unaware of other products out there that may help my situation or if my best bet would be to build a second, as cheap as possible pc capable only of streaming from a network, though honestly I have no experience in networking at all and it will be my first time setting one up despite using PCs since 95.

Any advice would be wonderful. I think about $400 is the max I have to spend on this project. 

More info if it helps: Two of the rooms are right next to each other, and cabling through that one wall is possible. The third room is downstairs of the other two, directly below. THE PC needs to be in one of the upstairs rooms. 

Thank you. 

edit: also should add that its OK if I only have one access point to the video files, I just want the ability to watch them in other rooms, if I have to start the video files in th PC room and watch them in another its NP.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me give you a completely honest take from someone who still considers Xenogears to be the greatest RPG ever made.

Has it aged well? In some aspects, yes. In many, no.

The two best qualities of the game for me, and many others, is the gameplay and story. The good news is both of these things (questionable translation at points aside) *HAVE* aged well. 

Now for the things that I think have *not* aged so well. For one, the artsyle and camera locations can make exploring and finding things a bit of a pain. Also, I find the opening few hours of the game a little bit tough to get through. But that may be because I have played through the first half so many times. 

You also can get lost in what you need to do at points if you arent paying enough attention or take a break from the game for a few weeks. Not through the whole game, but there are def points where you could find yourself not remembering what the hell you are supposed to do. 

Some people may disagree with some of my assessment, and that is OK. This is just my opinion. 

I will end this comment by saying that I still 100% recomment playing the game if you are a lover of JRPGs, because it is that good of a game. 

You absolutely get used to the negative things I mentioned after a few hours. The experience of this RPG is nearly unmatched. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first crash I had sucked. I lost about 2-3 hours of play. I fought through it. Through another 40 or so hours after that, I experienced probably 3-4 crashes. I had been saving as much as I could, but today it happened again, and happened after I did 90 straight minutes of synthesizing and then found myself at the underwater ruins with no campfires and a ton of good items. 

I had to go to work, so I left it on. Came back and it had crashed again....

It really stinks because I dont think I can go back and play it again now. The thought of resynthing all those items that I had painstakingly put together makes my brain melt. 

I was really enjoying the game....but this is a real shame. I still love the game, so I guess I will just wait and try to come back to it next year or something....but....just be really careful you guys =( </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-03-18 18:14:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello sub! As a kid, I used to love messing around with MIDIs. I composed a lot of songs without even using a keyboard...just manually selecting notes and plugging them into bars. 

I forget the name of the program that I used, but it was incredibly user friendly. This was about 15 years ago, so I am obviously not looking for the same one, but one that is the easiest for someone who doesnt know what the hell they are doing to compose some simple tracks. This time around, I am going to try to get back into actually playing on a keyboard, though it has been years. 

I was wondering if you all had any advice for me as to a keyboard/program combination that above all other qualities, are easy to use and understand. 

I have zero knowledge in regards to either of these things as I have been out of the loop for well over a decade. I looked at some programs and they all seemed incredibly overwhelming. I totally understand I will have to put in some time with whatever I end up with to learn, but Id like to minimize that as much as possible.

I have a combined budget of about 400 dollars for both. Thanks ahead of time!! </TEXT>

edit: lol, just came back to a flooded inbox of hate messages telling me to GTFO if I hate it so much. I can barely afford to survive at 50 hours a week, let alone be able to save the expenses required for such a move. If any of you Trump supporters would like to start a gofundme to get me to Canada, you go for it. Morons. </TEXT>

Then, for hundreds of years, generations of humans live and die on the ship, until they get word earth's atmosphere is back.

Maybe after a few hundred years on a ship, these humans went a little crazy and want to take back their planet from the "fake" cloned humans currently.on it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The cost for PSNOW really isnt that bad, IMO. 50 bucks for 3 months. When you spend more than 50 for a single brand new game, it makes sense to me. 

I have been very happy with the service, and there are a ton of JRPGs on there.

edit: man....the absolutely retarded downvotes on this sub lately have been such a turn off. I have been here for years now and I have really noticed a change lately...like an influx of children or something. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry. TWD for a number of years was something that was a major part of my life. It was one of the few times a week I would be social and gather with people to do something together, in this case watch a show. 

I considered it one of the best shows on TV for many many years. 

What I have seen it become over the last couple years really does bother me, yes. Am I taking this more seriously than other people? Of that I have no doubt. 

What frustrates me as much as the show, are how some fans, such as yourself, seem like you have a duty to defend it and its decisions at all cost. 

Of all the events that have taken place in TWD's story, Rick and Michonene together seems like the one that is the most *obviously* poorly done. 

I had never cringed at this show once until some of their scenes, mostly the ones this season. 

It is awkward, forced, and poorly written....and if fans would just own up to it and  admit it, instead of defending it, maybe we could get some change and get our show back. </TEXT>

I have a tendency to avoid pictures and gameplay of games when possible, but today in my excitement I checked out some info on what to expect in Firis, and I am blown away before even playing it. 

Its bigger, has a giant connecting zone instead of the old overworld map,  has many varied locations with bigger focuses on exploration...

There are weapons and SUB WEAPONS for each party member (sounds awesome!!)

Really though, it just LOOKS amazing. It really looks like the levels are from a real, high production value JPRG.

He screamed, I said I was so sorry and I was running to get a manager as I backpedaled away.

<TEXT> Alright well your view makes a bit more sense. I will be honest I was assuming you were fairly young, which was my mistake. 

I apologize if you stated it already, but did you play it when it came out, or many years later down the road? 

Either way, I should be more accepting of other people's opinions when they are vastly different from my own. 

I loved the PS2 generation as well, but for me, the SNES/PSX eras were my absolute favorites. I totally see what you are saying about the "experimental" stuff going on at the time, however you can easily make a case for experimental stuff going on in each generation since. It wasn't until The Last of Us just last generation that storytelling in a game finally reached equal ground with other mediums. Note that I am not talking story specifically, but storytelling.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> After a Patriots game about 10-15 years ago, I went around the stadium picking up pepsi caps. It was insane how many were thrown on the ground. I ended up having every single pocket of my pants, sweatshirt, and jacket stuffed to the brim. I think I got something like 3000 points from the 15 minutes of walking around. 

I got a leather jacket with them that has the Pepsi logo...never even contemplated wearing it once. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am on disability for anxiety. 

It took 2 years, and a handful of doctors to have it approved. This isnt a "damn Im really nervous about going to work" kind of anxiety. 

This kind of anxiety is the kind that literally destroys your life. Mine has been.

I had friends, a job, and other social connections.

As it got worse and worse, all of these things faded away into dust, while I was completely helpless watching it all happen. Its like I was watching myself in a movie, not being able to stop the downward spiral I was in. 

Do people seriously think I prefer this kind of life? Do they think I choose to live like a hermit mortified of every single small social interaction that exists in the world?

If I could trade it all in for a 40 hour job, my friends back, and *one* moment of having a clear head....I'd do it in a second.... </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After the long wait for FFXV and the ridiculousness that is the KH3 wait, I am officially concerned. 

When they announced the game and already had all that footage, and then when they showed combat just a few short months later, I felt like FINALLY Square had a solid plan and was working hard and fast on it. 

What brought me to make this post was the devs saying (just a few days ago) they are in the process of cleaning up the "Bombing run".

While it is possible that they have done much more of the game that takes places *after* the first couple hours of the original, we have no reason to believe that to be the case. 

It has been over a year, I believe, since we got the combat trailer. I get that they may not want to show much because it could still change, but having them not show a *thing* to us other than 2 still pictures, in over a year, especially when we were *told* we would get a lot more on it this winter....is bogus, and alarming. 

I have been worried about this game ever since it was announced that it would be done in episodes. 

If it takes them 3-4 years to make the opening Midgar section of the game, I will be dead by the time the game is on its last episode.

<TEXT> When I was 12, I used to go to my extended family's beach house. I went in the water, about 30-40 meters out. I noticed a ton of birds above me. Then, I started feeling things moving around my waste. I had waded into a school of little fish. The birds started dive bombing all around me for them. 

Then, as I was freaking out about that, I started feeling BIGGER fish around my feet. I screamed and started swimming as fast as I could to get to shore. Once I finally made it, in my panic, I didnt watch my footing and stepped directly on top of a jellyfish. 

It was then that I peed on my own foot while crying in front of dozens of people.

<TEXT> Because you dive in the open ocean, it's not uncommon for lost divers to never be found. People freak out at a gear malfunction and drown, get separated and disoriented and drown, run out of air and drown, or get separated and surface and can't find their buddies and just drift away.

I swear to god reading this just made me *feel* every single one of those horrifyingly terrible deaths. Fuck the ocean. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed. For me personally, I understand why contempt of court is there, and I am OK with it. Even if it "violates" my rights. 

Until I see it being used or taken advantage of, I will continue to feel that way. I havent seen too many stories of people being charged with it who didnt deserve it, though I am sure a few exist. 

But yeah, if it ever starts being abused I would take issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I am questioning is whether or not that woman posed a significant distraction to merit anything other than her removal from the room

That is entirely up to the judge. Again I am not a lawyer, but I believe that the law puts it at their discretion. Also it doesnt matter if the distraction was "significant". A distraction is a distraction, and they wont be tolerated, because when you start allowing one small one, it opens the floodgates.

<TEXT> I feel like english may not be your first language, which is OK. 

Are you saying that misbehaving and creating a distraction during criminal proceedings should not be punished? 

Like I said, it was a night or two in a cell, by herself. Not prison. She was safe and fine. 

Are you angry she had to do that instead of pay a large fine? Or do you think you should be allowed to do whatever you want inside a court room no questions asked? 

By the way, a large number of people would choose to spend a night or two in a cell by themselves rather than pay a few thousand dollars in fines. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love how Bernie is out there fighting for us and Hillary has dropped off the face of the planet.

edit: You guys are the left's version of trump supporters. Please just stop with crap like this sub, you make liberals look fucking ridiculous. There is a reason that well over 50% of the country, not limited to just dems and repubs hate her. 

edit: Since I seem unable to respond to people (dont know if I am banned or what the deal is) I will write what I tried to respond to someone with:

You'd think if she actually cared like she tried to tell people she did, despite it not being her job any more, she would be doing *something, anything*, to fight Trump. But she isn't. 

Whenever I say this, the only response I *EVER* get, is "and if she was here you would be telling her to go away".

Is that the case with some Bernie supporters? Yes, I am sure it is. Is it the case with all of them? No, obviously not, because it isn't how I feel. 

May I ask you, as a strong Hillary supporter, you really prefer her doing nothing right now?


edit: Plenty of people replying and messaging me nasty things, yet no one answers the question I asked in my previous edit....funny. Exactly like Trump supporters.

<TEXT> You are missing the point. The Celtics have no need to shift what they are  willing to give up for him. Why would they keep talking to the Bulls if that is the case, unless the Bulls are the ones who are lowering their price?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my opinion, I dont think that is really true. Its not like they are on the phone with each other every week trying to get a trade worked out. This was something they discussed earlier on but it fell through when it was revealed how much Chicago was asking for. 

If they are talking again, it means something has changed on one side, and its not the Celtics.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My take on this is that the Bulls *know* what Danny has said it would take to make the trade happen. 

The fact that Danny is quite obviously NOT desperate to make one, makes me believe Chicaco has come to him and is willing to reduce their asking price. 

My prediction is, if this report is true, he is going to be a Celtic. 

Of course these things are often bullshit.  </TEXT>

And Im not saying this as a sleight to him, he has had injury problems which has kept BB to use him on a limited basis. But BB will tell you how much he loves Danny.

Also, he has been our most clutch receiver in the playoffs the last 3 years.

<TEXT> HOUSTON -- In the most exciting fourth-quarter rally in Super Bowl history, the New England Patriots showed their remarkable resolve to do something no team has ever done before in coming back from a 28-3 deficit.

They were down 19 in the fourth quarter.

In rising up in such fashion to win 34-28 in overtime, quarterback Tom Brady wrote the most dramatic chapter in his future Hall of Fame career, earning MVP honors to set up a highly anticipated Monday morning MVP news conference with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell.

This was a script that not even Hollywood could have come up with for believability, especially when considering the greatest Super Bowl comeback had previously been 10 points.


Danny Amendola scored one of the Patriots' two fourth-quarter touchdowns that helped New England overcome a 25-point deficit. Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports
Linebacker Dont'a Hightower's strip sack in the fourth quarter changed the momentum of the game, and receiver Julian Edelman's 23-yard "how-did-he-do-that?" catch was the reverse David Tyree.

In the end, Brady took center stage as he won his record fifth Super Bowl in a game he dedicated to his mother, Galynn, who has been battling an undisclosed illness.

"We all brought each other back," Brady said on the Fox telecast after the game. "We never felt out of it. It was a tough battle. They have a great team. I give them a lot of credit. We just made a few more plays than them."

You could point to two mottos that stuck with the Patriots this season: Through the playoffs it was "One More," and throughout the season was the common refrain of "Do Your Job."

No season had a feel of the Patriots' motto of "Do Your Job" more than this season in which the team managed to prevail after obstacles from Brady's suspension to losing star tight end Rob Gronkowski to injury. What has stood out along the way is the stronger-than-the-norm emotion from Brady ("Let's gooooooo!!!!" he would often scream before games), with Brady embracing the Super Bowl moment as much as ever before.

Now that they've achieved their goals and won Super Bowl LI, here's the bottom line: This one means more.

It's vindication.

As owner Robert Kraft said in the days leading up to Super Bowl LI, Deflategate penalties levied by the NFL against Brady and the team had a deeply rooted impact on the 2016 Patriots. Brady was hit with a four-game suspension for the January 2015 incident that months of court battles couldn't overturn. Meanwhile, the Patriots were fined $1 million and docked a first-round pick in 2016 and a fourth-round pick in 2017.

"I think in a way," Kraft had said last week, "that galvanized our whole team."

All the way to a record fifth Super Bowl championship, with no more talk of underinflated footballs.

The 2016 season began with questions of how big of a hole the Patriots would have to dig out of playing without the suspended Brady. While oddsmakers still gave the Patriots 6-1 odds to earn a Super Bowl berth this season, that doesn't guarantee wins.

The Patriots may have begun the season without Brady, but they did have Belichick. He created a game plan that in conjunction with offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels allowed backup quarterbacks Jimmy Garoppolo and Jacoby Brissett, a rookie, to do enough to help the Patriots win their first three games.

There the Patriots stood, 3-0 without Brady, and they didn't have Gronkowski in two of those games because of a hamstring injury.

By the time Brady returned on Oct. 9 in Cleveland, it felt like a home game, many fans taking advantage of Columbus Day weekend to make the trip to be there for that moment when Brady first took the field.

It had a Super Bowl-like feel to it, and what manifested itself the rest of the season was a region showering Brady with its appreciation and love on a daily basis. While Brady had his offensive line protecting him on the field, New England fans, as passionate as ever, were protective of his legacy.

Random chants of "Brady! Brady! Brady!" broke out at games. His homecoming trip to San Francisco in late November provided a springboard for more reflection on his career.

By the midway point, the Patriots were 7-1, the Buffalo Bills accounting for their only loss in Week 4 (Brissett's final start). When Brady returned, he was protected by a healthy offensive line under the tutelage of veteran offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia, who returned from a pseudo retirement to lead the group.

The line not only helped Brady but created options for running backs LeGarrette Blount and Dion Lewis as the team's average of 117 rushing yards per game ranked seventh in the regular season after finishing 30th last season.

The Patriots needed other elements of their attack to be reliable, especially once Gronkowski was lost for the season due to a back injury he suffered against the Seattle Seahawks on Nov. 13.

The addition of veteran tight end Martellus Bennett via trade from the Chicago Bears last March meant the Patriots had another option when Gronkowski was placed on injured reserve. Bennett was the team's third-leading receiver with 55 catches, 701 yards and seven touchdowns.

Meanwhile, the defense had to come together after the offseason trade of defensive end Chandler Jones, and then a surprising in-season trade of linebacker Jamie Collins. Hightower, a team captain, cited the Nov. 20 win at San Francisco as a time when the group started to come together.

The unit ultimately finished the season ranked first in the NFL for fewest points allowed per game (15.6 average), although some critics still asked, "Have they truly played any top quarterbacks/offenses?"

It all ended up coming together for the Patriots, and Brady steered the direction. Once the Patriots arrived in Houston, the emotion of the season seemed to bubble over for Brady. During media night, his first night in Houston, Brady was nearly brought to tears in his meeting with reporters at the Super Bowl when a 7-year-old had asked him which person was his hero.

It was his dad, but Brady couldn't explain why. His eyes welled up, his voice cracked. That type of raw, poignant emotion has never been seen before from Brady in that setting, and it was quickly discovered why that was the case.

His mother, Gaylnn, has been dealing with an undisclosed illness, and it's put a strain on the tight-knit Brady family. So if there was a picture that captured the essence of Brady's emotions leading into Super Bowl LI, it was this.

The emotions peaked even higher as the confetti fell at NRG Stadium on Sunday night.

Brady took the stage and raised the Lombardi Trophy and yelled, "Let's go! Let's go!"

"Its going to be a great celebration tonight," Brady said from the stage. "Thank-you to all of our fans. Everyone back in Boston, New England, we love you. Youve been with us all year. Were bringing this sucker home! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im not sure I would have made it through the last two weeks without this sub or this team. It has been the distraction I needed. 

But when we were down by so much, I started feeling really, really low. I was desperate for a win so that I had something to feel some joy about. Now, I happen to be an atheist, but I still told Baxter out loud how much I needed this to help move on with things. I pretty much begged him for his help. 

I dont care if its a coincidence, everything about this experience the last 2 weeks, and this game tonight.....I know Baxter is ok now, I am feeling HAPPY, I am feeling PROUD (of so many different people), and I am feeling THANKFUL to be a member of this community. What an absolutely mind boggling night. 

We're onto #6. Fuck The Jets. I love you all.

<TEXT> What are these people doing? I am obsessed with RPGS so the name of one wont matter to me as long as the game itself is something I am interested in....

However, a lot of casual western RPG gamers, people for example who would never in a million years visit this sub, have got to look at games like Bravely Default or the upcoming Project Octopath Traveler, and be like "wtf is this weird shit, I will never play this". This upsets me because I am looking forward to that game more than anything and I want it to do well.

The list goes on, too.....The new Kingdom Hearts game titles? Seriously? And it isnt just square.....Idea Factory/Compile Heart (dont know which entity titles the game in the West) games like Hyper Dimension Neptunia? 

And I get that its not bad to be quirky or weird once in a while, but I just feel like its been such an over-saturated trend. Why doesnt it make sense to give your game a title that can relatively easily identify what your game is? 

Maybe I am alone on this and am about to get flamed, too, I dunno. Curious what you all think.

Edit: To be clear, some people for some reason get the impression that I think game titles are the most important aspect of a game or something.....Of course not. They are a minor part of what makes a game a game, and what makes it successful......but still a part of it.

I just feel like its starting to get ridiculous how much better he has been getting. From being a decent pickup when we first got him, to coming off the bench to score for us, to becoming a starter, a leader....to an all star...to a 50 point scorer....to the Eastern Conference leader in scoring. 

Its been an amazing journey, and its only been a couple short years, but feels like longer. My long drawn out point is, how much higher can he go? What are some things he would have work on in his game to be closer to the greats of the current and past eras?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hidden sidequests and/or party members: The JRPG dilemma </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-01 18:34:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have been thinking about this lately, as JRPGs have changed so much over the years. 

One of the biggest changes over the last 5-10 years (maybe a little bit longer) is a lot of catering to players who want to experience everything a game has to offer without putting any time or extended effort into finding. 

While I understand how many people appreciate this way to go about it, as not everyone has time to put 100 hours into a game, I feel that it has cheapened the experience of a lot of games. 

In pretty much every game that comes out now, all sidequests and most secrets can easily be found, in most cases, right on your map or mini map. For me, this dulls the gratification you would otherwise feel finding the objective on your own and completing it. 

Kind of similarly, is the general lack of secret/optionally recruited playable characters and/or party members in games when compared to generations past. Some examples off the top of my head are FF6 (which was the game that did it best, imo), Star Ocean 2, the Suikoden series, and a few more. While I know even back then the majority of games did not have these things in vast proportions, I feel there are most definitely *less* nowadays. 

I think there are two reasons for this over the years. The first goes back to my other point: people who buy these games want to be able to get everything their money paid for without having to sacrifice their personal life or time to get. The other, is that as stories have taken more cinematic approaches over the years, it is more difficult to implement hidden novelty characters, etc into games than it was in the past. 

 Lately, I have enjoyed the Cold Steel series, as even though side quests are marked on the map, you can turn it off (I think I remember being able to do that, my memory is fuzzy), but there were also some quests that were indeed hidden and unmarked. 

Also enjoyed the way Xenoblade Chronicles X party system worked out. It was hard work unlocking Mia!

Anway, I just feel like I would really love a return in some way or another to JRPGs that didnt hold your hand all the way through, and offered a wider array of hidden content you have to actually work for. There has to be a way to balance it better. </TEXT>

There is literally not one single channel that has done a blind reaction. The only one I found is a girl who did season 1 and then stopped uploading to her channel. 

If anyone has any youtube buddies, you should convince them to do this....as they would be the first on all of youtube to put up a reaction series to this amazing show. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I had this really old bag I kept hanging on to as a backup in case I ever went dry....its been months and luckily I have always had some fresh stuff so I never used it...

It was pure shake, dried as fuck....it was good bud when I got it though....but at the point it was at, if someone offered you some to smoke...you'd pass.

Anyway.....I had some coconut oil in my cabinet and decided, what the fuck, Im not gonna smoke it, lets try making some cannabis oil for the very first time. If I fuck up, I thought, who cares, its 6 month old weed I wasnt gonna smoke anyway.

I made it as carefully as possible, even going to the CVS down the street to pick up some Lecethin as the guides I read told me to. 

9 hours after beginning, my oil was done and I made the batter out of the first coconut oil recipe I found. It came out to a perfect consistency and color somehow. 

Baked that shit at 330 for 9 minutes. Ate one as soon as it came out. It tasted, somehow, incredible. It has been 90 minutes now, and I have a body high that you would never imagine rank-ass, half-a-year-old weed could ever give you. 

The moral of this story.....Dont be afraid to make your own oil or butter! I had always thought it was a tougher process than it is. But its not. If you can read a recipe, you can make it yourself. I am pretty god damn sure this is a complete shitpost, but I am feeling so good I really dgaf. I love you all.

My mind is blown. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My friend wanted to volunteer to help South Carolina recover from Hurricane Matthew. He found a church recruiting volunteers for the effort, but was blindsided by their volunteer "orientation" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-17 05:01:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ok, so, this is a retelling of the story told to me by the person who went through this today. So take from it what you want. 

My buddy really wanted to help clean up his area from the damage that hurricane Matthew caused. He did a quick search online for organizations looking for volunteers. The one he found close by was being run by a church. My friend is not religious, but didnt see why that should stop someone from volunteering with them (it shouldnt). 

As soon as he walked into the church he realized he made a big mistake. There was a woman speaking to the group about the "evils" of gay marriage. Perplexed, my friend thought he was certainly at the wrong place. He got up to leave and on his way out he asked someone by the door where the volunteers were meeting. The guy told him that he WAS in the right place, but the group was going through "orientation" and that he should sit back down. 

In order to volunteer with the group, you had to sit through this orientation of theirs, which apparently just consisted of an old woman reading hateful remarks from an index card, and the real kicker, YOU HAD TO SIGN A CARD DENOUNCING GAY MARRIAGE in order to volunteer with them. You cant make this shit up!!!!

This is one of those things where I cant believe it, but I *do* believe it. Sick of this shit. My buddy was so disgusted he walked out (while voicing his opinion to them)...so congrats, South Carolina Christian church, you managed to turn away someone who wanted to do some good today because of your obsession with other people's sex lives. 

Unreal. I wish I could say which church this was, but for the sake of rules, I wont.  </TEXT>
