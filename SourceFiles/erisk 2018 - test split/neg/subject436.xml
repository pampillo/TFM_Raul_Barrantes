<TEXT> Results: An increased risk of all cause mortality (hazard ratio for highest versus lowest fifth 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.29) and death due to nine different causes associated with red meat intake was observed. Both processed and unprocessed red meat intakes were associated with all cause and cause specific mortality. Heme iron and processed meat nitrate/nitrite were independently associated with increased risk of all cause and cause specific mortality. Mediation models estimated that the increased mortality associated with processed red meat was influenced by nitrate intake (37.0-72.0%) and to a lesser degree by heme iron (20.9-24.1%). When the total meat intake was constant, the highest fifth of white meat intake was associated with a 25% reduction in risk of all cause mortality compared with the lowest intake level. Almost all causes of death showed an inverse association with white meat intake.

Conclusions: The results show increased risks of all cause mortality and death due to nine different causes associated with both processed and unprocessed red meat, accounted for, in part, by heme iron and nitrate/nitrite from processed meat. They also show reduced risks associated with substituting white meat, particularly unprocessed white meat. </TEXT>

DNA repair is essential for life, yet its efficiency declines with age for reasons that are unclear. Numerous proteins possess Nudix homology domains (NHDs) that have no known function. We show that NHDs are NAD+ (oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) binding domains that regulate protein-protein interactions. The binding of NAD+ to the NHD domain of DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer 1) prevents it from inhibiting PARP1 [poly(adenosine diphosphateribose) polymerase], a critical DNA repair protein. As mice age and NAD+ concentrations decline, DBC1 is increasingly bound to PARP1, causing DNA damage to accumulate, a process rapidly reversed by restoring the abundance of NAD+. Thus, NAD+ directly regulates protein-protein interactions, the modulation of which may protect against cancer, radiation, and aging.

Our findings from a large, well-characterized prospective cohort provide compelling observational evidence on associations of vitamin D with lower risk of breast cancer morbidity and mortality.

Our replacement plan, Trump told a crowd in Roanoke, Va., in September, includes expanded access to Healthcare Savings Accounts, with support for those who need it. HSAs, which combine tax-free savings with a high-deductible insurance policy  a deductible of $2,500 or more  have long been a conservative favorite. In fact, legislation enabling HSAs was passed as part of the Medicare prescription drug benefit in 2003. There has been a very rapid increase in the use of HSAs in the interim, as employers offering health plans turned to them to offset rising health costs.

These are, in my humble opinion, the best articles I could find lately explaining why and how SO MANY political experts, media people and other brilliant minds, as well as millions of 'regular folks' - lik me, for example - completely misread these elections and wrongly dismissed Trump's potential to become president-elect.
Note that the Mike Moore's article was written well BEFORE the election's night.

Also, I think this moment will remain in my memory forever: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2uSG1xUEg

<TEXT>  ISIS ability to strike at will would mark a new threat for the country to contend with as U.S. and NATO forces ended their combat mission at the start of the year. It also further stretches the Islamic State groups influence far beyond its self-declared caliphate stretching through a third of Iraq and Syria. </TEXT>

We investigate the Flynn effect on several cognitive tests in England and Germany.



Individuals aged 50+ perform cognitively better if born into more recent cohorts.



The upward drift in mean cognitive abilities is similar across educational levels.



The use of modern technology by individuals aged 50+ has increased over time.



Trends in modern technology use are associated with the observed Flynn effect.

<TEXT> The original research is scheduled to appear online Aug 31, 2015 and to be published Sept 4, 2015 in the journal Physical Review Letters. 

The "most original" paper I could find is this: https://cmns.umd.edu/news-events/features/3188

As for the biased headline, here's EurekaAlert ("Evidence suggests subatomic particles could defy the standard model" http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-08/uom-ess082615.php) and U of M (Evidence Suggests Subatomic Particles Could Defy the Standard Model https://cmns.umd.edu/news-events/features/3188). 

- - -

In my opinon, I should wait until Aug 31 2015 for this to be peer-reviewed published, and then - but not earlier - I'll repost with the title "Evidence Suggests Subatomic Particles Could Defy the Standard Model: The scientists working at CERN have found evidence of leptons decaying at different rates, which could be evidence for non-standard physics"  

Please let me know what you think. Thanks! and sorry for the mess I might have created.

<TEXT>  parents smoking as related to ADHD

It's debatable, but there are several big studies published showing a significant, strong association between smoking parents and ADHD.

We found that maternal, but not paternal, smoking was significantly associated with elevated inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and total ADHD symptoms in children. 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3124822/

Compared with children born to nonsmoking mothers and smoking fathers, children born of smoking mothers and nonsmoking fathers had a higher risk of ADHD (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.53). We also saw a higher risk of ADHD in children of mothers who used nicotine replacement during pregnancy.

http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/07/16/peds.2014-0213.abstract

children who were exposed to secondhand smoke for less than one hour per day were 50% more likely to have some mental disorder compared to kids not exposed at all.

http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/childhood-adhd-linked-to-secondhand-smoke/

Postnatal parental smoking was associated with both parent and teacher ratings of ADHD symptoms and oppositional behavior. After controlling for a number of covariates, several of these relationships were still significant. The risk of maternal smoking for the development of ADHD symptoms does not end during pregnancy. 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3678953/


Children exposed to secondhand smoke in the home are more likely than children in smoke-free homes to develop behavior and learning problems, according to new research. These include learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and behavior and conduct disorders.

http://www.webmd.com/children/news/20110711/secondhand-smoke-may-boost-risk-of-learning-problems-adhd


As for fluoride vs ADHD, again there are several studies published within the last ~2 years, showing association between fluoridation and ADHD or lower IQ.

We report a dramatic and novel consequence of adaptation of mammalian cells to culture in which global loss of 5hmC occurs, suggesting rapid concomitant loss of methylcytosine dioxygenase activity. The observed epigenetic and transcriptional re-programming occurs much earlier than previously assumed, and has significant implications for the use of cell lines as faithful mimics of in vivo epigenetic and physiological processes. </TEXT>

Andrew Armour, a diving guide known for years as the Whale Whisperer, showed why his nickname is appropriate when while guiding a diving tour off Dominca Island in the Caribbean he prompted a sperm whale to mimic his actions.

Underwater photographer Scott Belt filmed the amazing interaction which he called a once-in-a-lifetime experience and unbelievable.

<TEXT> Joking aside, it's pretty obvious that only those who hit the button become "participants". Also, the "button engaged" issue is not covered at all by the "pressers vs. non-pressers" idea, or by the flair in general.

This is way more complex than "pressers vs. non-pressers".

<TEXT> Noticed there are two phenomenons happening?  The timer resets, and then at times the button gets engaged (a.k.a. fully pressed, a.k.a. a shock-wave appears), and **there is no apparent relationship between these two**. 

Every time someone hits the button, the timer resets, but the button does not get fully engaged every time is getting hit. Just watch the timer resets vs. the shock-wave occurrence.

Also, only those who hit the button became "participants", it seems. Once the timer gets to 0, they will be able to participate in something, don't know what. 

Once the timer reaches 0 and the button is fully engaged, some sort of a game will start. Maybe it's the reddit version of The Hunger Games. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Question is if it's beneficial on the long run, aka decreases mortality/morbidity. It's been known for a while that doses up 10,000 UI/day are (apparently) safe.

Also, it's strange, if it's 600 IU for most people, why do supplement labels always list 400 IU as 100%?

I'd assume it's because they didn't update their information. IOM (after much debate...) published the new Daily References Intake recommandations in 2010

<TEXT> The new study, which involved more than 77,000 adults, found that people consuming healthy vegetarian diets may have a lower risk of colon and rectal cancers than non-vegetarians, Orlich said.

"Our vegetarians not only **ate less meat than the non-vegetarians, but also less sweets, snack foods, refined grains and caloric beverages**," he said. And they ate more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans and nuts, he added.


Peer reviewed research paper source http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2174939

Vegetarian diets are associated with an overall lower incidence of colorectal cancers. Pescovegetarians in particular have a much lower risk compared with nonvegetarians. If such associations are causal, they may be important for primary prevention of colorectal cancers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> statins work against critical cellular functions that may help control tumor initiation, tumor growth, and metastasis. Specifically, statins reduce (or block) the activity of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase and thereby reduce the levels of mevalonate and its associated products. The mevalonate pathway plays a role in cell membrane integrity, cell signaling, protein synthesis, and cell cycle progression, all of which are potential areas of intervention to arrest the cancer process. 

http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/causes-prevention/risk-factors/statins-fact-sheet

Pharmacologically, statins may reduce cancer via reductions in inflammation, neovascular formation, and cell proliferation but can also inhibit selenoprotein synthesis and decrease natural killer cell function, which might enhance cancer risk.

<TEXT> PABLO MARTINEZ MONSIVAIS PHOTO

Source http://www.kplu.org/post/seattle-native-honored-presidential-medal-honor

On September 8, 2009, Swenson was part of an operation to connect the Afghan government with native elders in the Ganjgal Valley in Eastern Kunar Province in Afghanistan, near the Pakistan border.

According to the U.S. Army's detailed Official Narrative, the coalition force's 106-man column entered the valley and was ambushed at about 6 a.m. by as many as 60 insurgent fighters who soon surrounded the column on three sides, situated on terraced high ground. Within an hour, communication to the front of the column, including four U.S. servicemen, was lost. Meanwhile, Captain Swenson, who initially was positioned toward the rear of the column, called for air support, and with two comrades crossed 50 meters of open space under direct enemy fire to administer life-extending first aid to his severely wounded sergeant. When the column was surrounded by enemy fighters that advanced within 50 meters, Swenson responded to Taliban demands for surrender by throwing a hand grenade, an act of defiance that rallied his comrades to repel the enemy advance.


Swenson and comrades moved his sergeant and other wounded to a helicopter for medical evacuation before returning to the enemy's "kill zone" for at least two more trips in an unarmored vehicle to evacuate additional wounded. Returning even more deeply through the kill zone toward the location of the head of column in search of the four U.S. servicemen, Swenson's party first rescued and recovered several Afghan National Security Force wounded and dead. Finally, Swenson and a small contingent recovered the four fallen U.S. servicemen who had been discovered by a search and rescue aircraft at noon. The 6-7 hour firefight caused 15 coalition deaths, including the four U.S. servicemen; also, Swenson's sergeant, Kenneth Westbrook, died of his wounds after returning from Afghanistan. Swenson's actions are believed to have directly contributed to saving more than a dozen Afghan lives.

I think another idea may be to have a third box - here https://www.reddit.com/r/science/submit - under 'title', 'url', where the 3rd could be something like 'post moderators' comments'. Another useful thing may be to have the source/peer-reviewed paper - and maybe the author(s)? - posted in this box, right under the title of the submission, so anyone can easily see it (instead of searching through the comments for the source).  Or just a 'standard' text-box under the title of every submission, available for mods only, where only the mods can add/edit stuff?

The idea is that these types of antibiotics would kill specifically those cells with huge mitochondrial activity: cancer cells in the first place, but also other stem cells in the body (that's how Chloramphenicol causes bone marrow suppression, for example) with similar mitochondrial activity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yet! there already is some data - human studies! -  suggesting that antibiotics do indeed have the ability to improve cancer patients' condition. Is just that they didn't really bother to study and to quantify the effect precisely. Also, this would apply to cancer STEM CELLS only, it won't replace chemo/radiotherapy (but should improve survival).


*Edit to add: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/01/150128081957.htm

In the lung cancer patients, azithromycin, the antibiotic used, increased one-year patient survival from 45% to 75%. Even lymphoma patients who were 'bacteria-free' benefited from a three-week course of doxycycline therapy, and showed complete remission of the disease.

 (4) This is a study strictly about Paxil, and not about just any antidepressant.

 (5) Title should be: Exposure to THIS PARTICULAR antidepressant in womb AND in youth can cause lifetime decline in sexual behavior, body weight, and competitive ability. 

Because the mice were given Paxil when they were in womb, AND THEY CONTINUED to receive Paxil until they reached adulthood. That is a really long run of Paxil!

And of course it can cause decline in sexual behavior. Paxil's adverse effects on the long run are well known; sexual dysfunction is one of the most common https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_adverse_effects_of_paroxetine

Chrome users can install the WebRTC block extension or ScriptSafe, which both reportedly block the vulnerability.

Firefox users should be able to block the request with the NoScript addon. Alternatively, they can type about:config in the address bar and set the media.peerconnection.enabled setting to false.

The findings are interesting because walking group participants reaped health benefits even though many of the groups did not meet international guidelines for moderate activity. This supports the idea that any activity is better than none.

In the community, alcohol consumption of up to 7 drinks/week at early-middle age is associated with lower risk for future HF, with a similar but less definite association in women than in men. These findings suggest that despite the dangers of heavy drinking, modest alcohol consumption in early-middle age may be associated with a lower risk for HF.

<TEXT> Optimists had significantly better blood sugar and total cholesterol levels than their counterparts. They also were more physically active, had healthier body mass indexes and were less likely to smoke, according to a paper on the research that appears in the January/February 2015 issue of Health Behavior and Policy Review.

http://americanlivewire.com/2015-01-10-heart-health-may-depend-optimism-levels/

"Individuals with the highest levels of optimism have twice the odds of being in ideal cardiovascular health compared to their more pessimistic counterparts," said lead author Rosalba Hernandez, a professor of social work at the University of Illinois.

"This association remains significant even after adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and poor mental health," Hernandez added.

Statin use and fruit consumption were also found to be favorable 'factors':

The study also looked at the effects of diet and **statin drugs**, both of which have been implicated in lowering Alzheimer disease risk. Statins are widely prescribed for lowering cholesterol, and there were 3975 subjects who used statins when they began the study. Their risk for Alzheimers disease mortality was 60% lower than non-users. 

Consumption of three or more pieces of **fruit** per day was associated with 60% lower Alzheimers disease mortality </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to Sanders, who cited federal records, the average prices of more than 1,200 generic drugs increased by more than 400 percent from July 2013 to July 2014. Now one in four Americans cannot afford to buy drugs anymore.

Two tablets of albuterol sulfate, a drug needed by those who suffer from asthma, were priced at $11 in October 2013. Half a year later, the price went up to $434. A bottle of doxycycline hyclate, an antibiotic, was sold for $20 in Oct. 2013. In April 2014, the price of the same bottle was a staggering $1,849. The list could go on.

37 healthy volunteers, ages 50 to 69, were randomized to receive either a high-flavanol diet (900 mg of flavanols a day) or a low-flavanol diet (10 mg of flavanols a day) for three months.

The Bisti Badlands is a "scenic and colorful expanse of undulating mounds and unusual eroded rocks" located along highway 371 in quite literally the middle of nowhere. It's so far from anywhere that the silence is almost absolute and a little eerie.

<TEXT>  We investigate the effects of resistance exercise on emotional episodic memory.

 We measure physiological state with heart rate, blood pressure, and alpha amylase.

 We use a knee extension/flexion task for resistance exercise.

 We find that resistance exercise during consolidation can benefit memory.

 We find effects of valence based on the physiological response to the exercise.

Baugh responded after the first attack there in 1993 and helped tow wrecked cars from the bombed garage. But the WTC ribbon is from the attack on 9/11, which saw Baugh race to the scene after the first plane struck.

The Healthy Eating Aerobic and Resistance Training in Youth (HEARTY) study, led by researchers at the University of Calgary and University of Ottawa, involved 304 overweight teens in the Ottawa/Gatineau area between the ages of 14 to 18. All were given the same four weeks of diet counseling to promote healthy eating and weight loss before being randomly placed into four groups. The first group performed resistance training involving weight machines and some free weights; the second performed only aerobic exercise on treadmills, elliptical machines and stationary bikes; the third underwent combined aerobic and resistance training; and the last group did no exercise training.

In the overall study population, each type of exercise reduced body fat significantly and similarly. All three exercise programs caused significantly more fat loss than in the diet-only control group. Among youths who completed at least 70 per cent of the study's exercise sessions, the **percentage of body fat decreased "significantly more in those who did combined aerobic and resistance exercise than in those who only did aerobic exercise,"** says co-principal researcher Dr. Glen Kenny of the University of Ottawa. "Remarkably, among participants who completed at least 70 per cent of the prescribed exercise sessions, waist circumference decreased close to seven centimeters in those randomized to combined aerobic plus resistance exercise, versus about four centimeters in those randomized to do just one type of exercise, with no change in those randomized to diet alone."

Researchers hope that the study will contribute to a national debate about childhood and teenage obesity, potentially leading to a consistent, long-term strategy on how to best deal with the problem. Eighty per cent of overweight youth typically continue to be obese as adults, adversely affecting the quality of their lives and contributing to chronic disease problems. Adult obesity increases risk of diabetes, heart disease, cancer and disability. </TEXT>

To clarify for everyone, this is a bit of an optical illusion. The lake is not that much higher than sea level, and this picture is taken from a high angle looking down at the cliff. The opposite side of the cliff slopes down to the lake. Here's another angle for comparison. http://ppcdn.500px.org/46339490/2b6c10f255a64480610cd0fee2a9281a646a584b/2048.jpg

<TEXT> Good point; full access to Cell.com would likely answer all these. Until then, what I gather from other sources is that they used fMRI on patients under escitalopram:

Study participants let their minds wander for about 15 minutes in a brain scanner that measures the **oxygenation of blood flow in the brain**. The researchers characterized three-dimensional images of each individual's brain by measuring the number of connections between small blocks known as voxels (comparable to the pixels in an image) and the change in those connections with a single dose of escitalopram (trade name Lexapro).

Their whole-brain network analysis shows that one dose of the SSRI reduces the level of intrinsic connectivity in most parts of the brain. However, Sacher and her colleagues observed an increase in connectivity within two brain regions, specifically the cerebellum and thalamus.

http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/09/140918121436.htm

LA Times goes even further:

They created 3-D maps of connections that matter to gray matter: interdependence, not just anatomical connection. They relied on a discovery in the late 1990s that **low-frequency brain signaling during relative inactivity, such as daydreaming, is a good indicator of functional connectivity**.

When more serotonin was available, this resting state functional connectivity decreased on a broad scale, the study found. This finding was not particularly surprising -- other studies have shown a similar effect in brain regions strongly associated with mood regulation.

But there was a two-fold shock: Some areas of the brain appeared to buck the trend and become more interdependent. And all the changes were evident only three hours after the single dosage.

It was interesting to see two patterns that seemed to go in the opposite direction, Sacher said. What was really surprising was that the entire brain would light up after only three hours. We didnt expect that.

Most people who use antidepressants don't report any discernible change in mood for at least two weeks, said Sacher, who also is a psychiatrist. 

The rapid connectivity shifts noted by the study might therefore be precursors to longer-term changes, perhaps starting with remodeling of synapses, the microscopic gaps where chemical neurotransmitters such as serotonin flood across to an adjacent brain cell, the study suggests. But this type of brain scanning cant pick up changes at such a scale, so the hypothesis will have to be tested other ways, Sacher added.

<TEXT> to help determine exactly what changes occur during tDCS, and for specialized treatment

You'd need a fMRI for that, taken during the tDCS session; I don't think one can expect meaningful results from an EEG taken during tDCS. 

These days I see there are more and more studies and clinical trials involving tDCS   fMRI, and they may need volunteers, see if you find one in your area, maybe?

Also, keep us updated? Good luck, OP! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Between 40% and 47% of Americans over the past 32 years have said the creationist explanation for the origin of human life best fits their personal views. These Americans tend to be highly religious, underscoring the degree to which many Americans view the world around them through the lens of their religious beliefs. Those who adopt the creationist view also tend to have lower education levels, but given the strong influence of religious beliefs, it is not clear to what degree having more education or different types of education might affect their views.


These relationships do not necessarily prove that if Americans were to learn more about evolution they would be more likely to believe in it. Those with less education are most likely to espouse the creationist view and to be least familiar with evolution, but it's not clear that gaining more education per se would shift their perspectives. Many religious Americans accept creationism mostly on the basis of their religious convictions. Whether their beliefs would change if they became more familiar with evolution is an open question.

As far as I can see, there nothing in the online media relevant as to what was in Cody Cousins' head when he decided to kill another fellow... 

Quotes  for 'reason' as I can't see any reasoning behind the crime being logic~~al~~ based.

WTF happened there and why?! If we know what was in his mind, maybe we can start thinking about the next thing: was there any way this could have been prevented? or to prevent anything similar from happening in the future? </TEXT>
