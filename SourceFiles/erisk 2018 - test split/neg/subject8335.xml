<TEXT> Certainly you may be a US citizen, but a person's mindset and opinions on things like healthcare, for the vast majority of people, are highly informed by the culture and environment where they grew up. If you ask someone in Italy or France if they consider healthcare a right, almost *everyone* will agree that it is, just as if you ask folks who grew up in a place like Laos or Chad, they will almost be confused by the question as they are not taught that it (or many other things) are considered "rights." 

I'm not sure of course, and have no idea how long you've lived in the US, but I suspect people who grew up in Armenia, like other parts of West Asia, would have similar viewpoints as you, just as most people who grew up in Canada, where I'm from originally, generally think that the debate as to if healthcare is or is not a right is patently redundant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agree. If she showed even an ounce of compassion for Offred, perhaps, but thus far she is not only complicit but unnecessarily cruel. It will be interesting to see where this is taken; she is shown to be manipulative and exploitive in the book plot and though it is certainly possible the show will eventually portray her in a different light and redeem her somehow, for now, it looks like she's truly not meant to inspire sympathy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're not alone - a lot of fans were underwhelmed and disappointed with S6. Though the series could have ended fairly neatly and logically with S5 (or S4 for that matter), I would go so far as to say S6 was better than S3, 4, or 5 as seasons in themselves. I found it creative and, for lack of a better word, just more mature, with honest story arcs for the main characters dealt with both compassionately and sharply. I wasn't a fan of the finale exactly, but the season as a whole I really loved. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fair enough. The intent of the sub when it was created about 6 years ago had been to discuss the interpretation and practise of vipassana in the tradition of Goenka-ji. It's really been the past year I guess that other practises and traditions under the "vipassana" moniker have been discussed here too with some frequency. I was definitely a bit concern troll-y here, but if the sub continues to morph into something different than its original intent, well, I guess that's up to the mods and community to either stop, allow, or encourage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Speaking as someone who adores this show and the previous 2 seasons, the end was a bit cheesy. If they wanted to show the dead it could have been done more authentically, like the last seconds of their "real" lives. Teo would have been interesting to see especially.

<TEXT> I think a lot of the success of her performance in this role has to do with how the type of writing and the character are just better suited to her abilities than Gilmore Girls could be. It takes a talented actress to be able to hold her own next to Elisabeth Moss, but Alexis nailed it. I love The Handmaid's Tale.

<TEXT> The beds weren't harder at the centers I did my 2nd and 3rd courses at. AFAIK centers generally have more comfortable arrangements for old students. 

I actually struggled *less* with both the schedule and diet the 2nd time around - I think because my body and mind were like *Oh, yeah, I remember this* so there was no shock to the system really. And the tea-only at 5 wasn't a problem.

Like someone else suggested, you will want to re-start your practise before the course begins, but I guess that's just in a few days! Also, many find their 2nd course is *not* like the 1st in any number of ways. You will struggle with different things, and elements that felt "easier" or more difficult the first time round may be diametrically different this time. It's best to let go of any expectations. 

In any case, have a good course :)

<TEXT> If you really don't know, they're probably fairly equal in terms of what may be "best" for you. Most people have a helpful hunch and naturally gravitate towards what's most suitable for them, based on their past experiences with either small, medium, or large children :)  Personally, I thought I wanted to teach high school, did for a short time and then got a job at a middle school, which I, to my surprise, *hated.* I went back to high school and never looked back, but this year was made to teach a Gr 8 class for the first time in 8 years. And I love it.

Listen to your gut, but be open to trying different things, and keep your  mind open - you will evolve, and your teaching preferences and talents may too. </TEXT>

Nick got pretty suss pretty quickly too, and there was a lot of character development with Moira. They're almost definitely angling Offred as more rebellious than she was portrayed in the book as well. Love it so far!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> You don't need to choose any one path "for the rest of [your] life" just now. You're, what, early 20s? Try some different things that attract you, but stay focussed on the search for truth I would suggest, not chasing after "spiritual experiences" or "awakenings" as ends in themselves. 

It seems you may have had a habit of jumping from one spiritual tradition to another - like following Christianity intensely for 12 days, then quitting, in spite of an awakening experience. If you're expecting quick enlightenment like from being hyperaware of everything (not sure what that means tbh), it will almost definitely not happen.

The *overwhelming* majority of 13-year-olds who try vipassana will find it too difficult unless approached in the right frame of mind and with the right intention. That you couldn't sit still for 2 minutes is not unusual, but is also a sign that you would benefit immensely from a regular practise. A regular mindfulness practise will absolutely beneficial. If you're up for something a little deeper and more intense, I would look into doing a proper 10-day vipassana course if you are so inclined. Check out www.dhamma.org for more details/info.

<TEXT> Were you in China (or nearly any East Asian country) they would say the reverse. I am living in China and have several friends with mixed race children, who hear *constantly* from people how "white" their children look - comments on their skin tone, how "big" their eyes are, even their body types! North Americans, believe it or not, tend to be *more* subtle.

In any case, you can gently correct people, by saying something like "We find she has features from both of us" or "Actually, we find she looks more similar to me/my mother/her grandmother/whomever." You can be more direct, as well, saying "To be honest, it hurts a little to hear that as we think she is a beautiful mix of both of our features."

Explicitly racist comments, like derogatory comments about her eyes like you mentioned, are well dealt with by gently saying you or your family find that word or phrase offensive. You may choose to briefly explain why if you're comfortable. 

*Most* of these comments, like how she looks Chinese, come from a place of simple ignorance rather than bigotry, and a kind simple explanation can help them understand how their words can offend. It's up to you, though, and if you feel more comfortable letting it go or nodding and smiling curtly then going about your business, that's definitely your prerogative. </TEXT>

Some countries, like Sweden, have hard drugs categorised as "illegal" but do not have anything like a "war on drugs" where that devotes vast resources to things like prosecution and incarceration, focussing more on education and rehabilitation. As a result the hard drug use and trafficking is, by European standards, relatively low and frees up incredible funds for other, more useful gov't spending. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I very occasionally will read the last 10 pages or so of a novel before reading. I'd done this after hearing a really radio show where the guest was advocating this as a technique. The idea behind it was that with many novels, the reader spends an enormous amount of energy wondering and speculating about "how it's going to end" when they would enjoy the book more, and ultimately get more out of it, if they already knew the general ending in advance. The few times I've done this, I have found it gives a richness to the narrative and also creates a different kind of intrigue, as it is the most intense form of dramatic irony. It alters the reading experience, though not always in a bad way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On the absolute contrary, this show has mostly *been* about failure, struggle, and starting over, for basically all the characters. Hannah has had intermittent successes and failures and admittedly caught a great break with this teaching position but looking at the others:

* Shoshanna had a massive struggle finding the "right" job for her before she got the job in Japan - from which she was laid off only a few months later. She also seemed to have nothing solid for a while before her "current" job.

* Marnie was unsuccessful at interviews and ended up with piecemeal temporary work (hostess, barista, Soo Jin's assistant) until focussing on her career as a definitely struggling musician who couldn't even make rent.

* Jessa has never had stable work that lasted more than a couple of months.

* Elijah, as a character, had the raw talent for the gig he got, but he seems to have been on the brink of poverty for years after graduating.

* Ray worked for Hermie for what could easily have been 15+ years before Hermie died.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I loved this article, and this writer's perspective. 

So many of the criticisms of this show that I've heard revolve around the idea of *Girls* being some massive statement piece about what life is exactly like for intelligent, fairly creative 20-something white women in the modern urban western world. This is the story of a few unique characters on unique journeys. It's not so easily categorised, and nor are its characters or the themes it illustrates. I am going to miss it immensely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 35. The book was definitely meant for teen-aged readers in terms of the writing and characterisation (Asher has been open about that too). The series I find kind of a mixed bag. I don't think the show was *intended* for teens - it's way too graphic, too harsh, too dark for them to be the core demographic - but it also has a tone that's not fully "adult" either. There's an immaturity to the script, that makes it seem sometimes like it's meant for anyone, sometimes for mature audiences, sometimes for high schoolers. Maybe because Hannah's voice is so authentically teen-y, and it's though the script and even dialogue was written by a teenager, not an adult, in many ways.

That said, I will recommend it to most of the adults I know who, well, like good TV. </TEXT>

It was Hannah who convinced her to stay in I guess S2, to make it work in NY. I think it would be interesting to see her move to some very obscure place to start over. I don't really like Jessa, and don't think the writers will take it this way, but it'd be good to see her get out of that shitshow of a thing with Adam and have a fresh start. </TEXT>

Like Hector's character 1st season, I suspect Cabral is going to make me empathise intensely with Isaac completely in spite of myself.

Interesting to me how the writers are taking their time drawing the connections between all the different characters. The other 2 seasons most of the connections were laid on the table quite explicitly, quite quick. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The majority of a woman's weight, unless she is **straddling** a bench, will be on her buttocks with a small portion on her labia. This picture would only be accurate if a woman was planted squarely on her hole. Here's an experiment (if you're female). Sitting on a normal kind of chair with your legs out in front of you at a 90 degree angle, slide a finger up your vagina. You will notice it goes in at angle, right? Not straight up? That's because you're not planted puss-flat on a chair. You're sitting *mostly* on your ass, not your vag. 
Such an imprint would be possible on a bike seat, but not a chair or bench, unless you are really built differently than the average woman.

<TEXT> If being with someone with the same religious/spiritual beliefs as him is important to him, he likely would have brought it up already, especially if you've been dating for a significant amount of time. If you feel like you're misleading him somehow, or that he's gotten the impression that you are also a Christian, it would be good to discuss with him sooner rather than later. 

Also, if you really feel compelled to share with him, you should. A relationship will ultimately be quite weak if you can't be open with each other about your beliefs. This doesn't mean being aggressive or "attacking" his beliefs (you can say *I believe x* without that becoming *You are wrong and everything you believe is wrong*). Ultimately, though, if he's "weirded out" or feels attacked simply by you sharing what you believe, it is likely not the healthiest relationship for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is so much great advice here so instead of rehashing that, I'll point out some thoughts I had reading your post.

Often, the things we hate most about people, and groups of people, are things that we are afraid to confront within ourselves. So when you say things like this:
 I view them as physically inferior, the destroyers and stealers of culture and generally unoriginal 

I wonder, do you consider yourself physically inferior? Unoriginal? Destructive? The destruction you hate so much as perpetrated by whites is not so dissimilar to the destruction (emotional or otherwise) caused by the rage you may on occasion feel. It is a vicious cycle of anger, the desire for power and validation, all to support and strengthen the ego. This happens on the global, local, and personal level, cyclically. 

You have likely been using anger as a coping mechanism against the institutional injustices -- real and tragic ones, no question -- against your "people" and minorities as a whole. But we are all one. Was not the violence of Native American tribes committed against one another as vile, as murderous, as unnecessary - albeit on a smaller scale - as the violence perpetrated from one larger society against another?

You say "My people are still slaves" - fair enough. On a literal level slavery existed before even written history, and persists today on a literal level. "Brown" people are chattel slaves under ISIL, thousands of "brown" and "white" women and children also sold as slaves. Hundreds of thousands of "black" children are enslaved as child soldiers throughout much of a continent. Almost a million people are enslaved ("blacks" by "blacks") in Niger. Upwards of 200,000 "east asian" people in North Korea are subject to hard slave labour and torture in massive prison camps. It is not only one particular race of people who have destroyed, conquered, or enslaved others. And from a personal angle, we are all slaves to our desires, to our aversions, which Buddhists seek to liberate themselves from. 

Some study of history and current events can help you to be more aware of injustices perpetrated by many cultures, and this awareness may serve you on your path away from your racist leanings. We must also learn to accept the past as the past. Some of my ancestors (quite "white") were gassed by the Nazis; further back other ancestors of mine were enslaved by Italians. Literally nothing I or my family does will change that fact. To progress spiritually we *must* accept these facts, and then look to confront the problems within *ourselves* - our own ego's need to solidify itself, to feel powerful and safe. Through seeking to understand each other you will find that we are not so easily divided into race, that we all have the same fears and desires within us, that we are none of us truly so different. </TEXT>

As a side note, I would have died to see a couple of Kirk/Lulu spawn, a mix of them both.
Truthfully, the revival could have done with a couple of new, well-drawn, engaging characters. Our closest thing to new characters was Paul, the musical cast, and a 1-second reference to Michel's husband. I think that would have involved too much forethought and, well, actual writing though.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why are you uncomfortable with her saying these things to you?
What is the worst possible outcome (for you) of a continued relationship?

These are very good questions that I don't know how to answer. On a very basic level, certain key elements of our friendship just disintegrate when we get into interactions like that, so it's like I'm suddenly confronted with someone who is not my friend. In those moments (and now, in reflecting) I feel that I can no longer trust her, I don't enjoy her company, and I feel guarded and restricted, all signs of a flailing friendship. Part of the discomfort, too, I guess, comes from my own ego, and how it is continually threatened when she sends me messages like the ones she's been sending (both figuratively and literally). I'm not desperate to support my own ego, mind you, but the negative energy that has arisen with all of that is something I don't want in my life.

The worst possible outcome.. again, I don't know. Because of this I just truly don't enjoy spending time with her, and also just feel very uncomfortable around her. Who chooses to spend time with people whose company they don't enjoy?

I think I've realised, literally whilst typing this reply, how much I've already made the decision as it were. Maybe this is an opportunity to learn about myself, as you suggested, but I also think this is a relationship on its way out.

The tree analogy is super apt. I love it.

Thanks for your thoughts. You've been very insightful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the link. I'll check it out.

 If you are not craving validation, then dis-respect (and respect) means nothing to you.

I understand this sentiment, but at the same point it is extremely difficult when someone is saying something akin to *hey, you know that thing that is at the core of your being and the most important part of your life? It's terrible and you need to change it*. I'm not sure how a relationship can work with that kind of energy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Get to know your kids in those early days! Kids at that age (well, most ages, actually) respond really well to knowing you care about them, want to know them, and form a real connection with them.

Try to be both firm and kind. Your supervising teacher can probably help you figure out this balance if it's something you struggle with.

It's great to have confidence like what you've expressed, but becoming a truly great teacher takes lots of time and experience. Try to keep your expectations high but also realistic!

Good luck :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's really cool to hear about your priest. We became close colleagues as we work at the same place. We just naturally had a great rapport with each other, enjoyed each other's company and conversation, and seemed to be on the same wavelength with a lot of different things - mind you, she was much more moderate in her beliefs then. There was just a great platonic chemistry we had with each other. We've also been strong support systems to one another in various things, and that's drawn us closer to. We've felt like sisters to one another, albeit sisters who don't exactly have that much in common on paper. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the challenging bit here is that evangelical Christians feel like if they don't proseltize then they're letting you down as a friend by not "saving your soul."

From a purely philosophical perspective, trying to prevent a friend's soul from burning in eternal fire is in a weird way both noble and understandable. If someone is about to be hit by a bus, you try to save them. Just because they say "There's no bus! I'm fine!" you are behaving unethically in just shrugging and saying "welp, guess they'll just have to wait and see." So this aspect of evangelising I understand from that angle and a small part of me is grateful and touched... but I still can't actually tolerate it anymore on a personal level.

<TEXT> I really like the way you've outlined this.

I've been taught to stick to one mantra for meditation specifically, and to never change it. I tentatively recommend that to others, too, and have found that aspect of my meditation practise to have been very helpful in helping me to focus and easily enter into that type of communion. That said, I chant and occasionally pray to many deities, though I have always found the energy and intention in kirtan vs meditation to be quite different. When chanting, I have found it, in intention and practise, much more akin to prayer with meditative characteristics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The hairiness you mention is pretty real! I do view my own personal yoga practise as a religious kind of practise, though I'm fully aware that most modern yogis can divorce the religious/spiritual roots of it and focus solely on the physical activity. When you live and study at a place like the Ashram I lived at, the practises (meditation, chanting, pranayama, yoga asanas, etc.) all becomes kind of one thing. So when I lived there I had a some religious experiences, some of which I told her about - in hindsight, probably ill-advisedly. Now she, perhaps rightly, conflates the practise of yoga and Hinduism, based on what I've told her about my own experiences. </TEXT>

Sort of. She's married to a man that she is thinking of divorcing, and is in love with another man who is ill with some unspecified illness, which she is convinced is cancer and that he will die in a few months. This has taken a very strong toll on her emotionally, and she's struggling **a lot** with the thought of him dying, and her own moral conflict over having an affair with him (which has since ended).

I have tried to, but it may not have been with that kind of wording. I have tried to avoid telling her things like she's pushed me away, as I don't want to place blame and wanted to keep the focus more on what *I* need, if you know what I mean. I've perhaps not been direct enough in expressing how I'm not going to change my path, as I have said (and believe) that Christ was a divine figure, and she has interpreted that as an "in", or a sign I'm open to re-converting. I may have to be more direct. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im hoping for a little bit of insight and/or advice on a tricky situation Im in right now.

As background: For the past ~8 years, I have devoted a lot of energy into the study and practise of Buddhism, Hinduism, meditation, and yoga. Spiritually, my beliefs are a bit of a combination of Hinduism and Buddhism, and my core spiritual practise is classical hatha yoga and Vipassana meditation. I lived at a yoga Ashram for a year, and have served/studied at various Vipassana meditation centres. This has been a huge part of my life in recent years.

A very good friend of mine is a devout Christian, of the fundamentalist variety. Like me, she came to her spiritual beliefs later in life, several years ago. We used to discuss religion and spirituality but eventually it became too awkward as we disagreed on so many points. Last spring she also expressed grave concern for my soul, how she thinks through yoga and meditating Im opening myself up to demonic influence and since then I have tried to avoid those conversations with her since then.

Of late, she started sending me lots of articles and videos discussing various aspects of Christianity, including some texts attempting to show how science has proven Christianity to be the one true religion.. stuff like that. I asked her to please not send me those things anymore, and was happy and satisfied with my current beliefs and practises.

Her response was a little aggressive, and she began expressing how dangerous and evil the practise of yoga and meditation is, how Hinduism is a delusion created by Satan, etc. I told her I was very uncomfortable with her saying these kinds of things, and that though I am happy to be friends with someone with differing beliefs, I would have to step away from a relationship with someone who continued to disrespect my beliefs/practises in that kind of way. She said she would need time to think about that. I asked if we could talk about it more and she said shed need weeks to really think about it.

Am I being too hasty in reacting this kind of way? Should a yogi or serious meditator tolerate/accept continued proselytizing and the like? </TEXT>

<TEXT> From another angle, I would say Rory's identity and personality as a 32-year-old is a plausibly natural extension of her OS self. Rory has always been highly, sometimes disastously, impulsive, from small things like running off the NY to see Jess to sleeping with Dean to stealing the yacht; professionally she's also flip-flopped massively, turning down the job at the Providence paper while hoping for the NYT internship, abandoning her journalistic dreams after the talk with Mitchum, finally taking the online magazine job not because it's what she truly wanted but because it was her only viable option, however interesting. 

Rory's impulsivity as rooted in her emotional desires, logic and long-term ramifications notwithstanding, has always been pre-eminent, as has her misplaced professional potential. That she becomes a serial cheater who has intermittent, ambivalent success as a journalist is in some ways a perfectly natural extension of her character development in the OS. (As a small sidenote, her lack of a stable home situation in AYITL - NY, London, Stars Hollow - also speaks to her inability to stay rooted in one place even as an 18-21 year old, flitting regularly between Stars Hollow, New Haven, and her grandparents' house, too.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, meditation did not make your life worse! What can happen (*does* happen) when many start meditating is that they start to see and perceive certain aspects of their lives more clearly which in the short term can seem like a negative effect. So you mention how you "started seeing the world as a little uglier" - that can be manifested as a side effect of becoming more *aware* of certain realities that you may have ignored or seen through differently coloured lenses. The more you practise properly, the more equanimous you will become; this is kind of like a beginning stage it sounds like you are in, even if you began practising last year. Meditation practise can also cast light on certain negative patterns, or ideas of your "self" as well, but this negativity should be temporary.

When we start to really experience the effects of meditation, the ego often begins to feel very threatened, the mind can rebel, and this manifests in LOTS of different ways for different people. For many, the mind starts to perceive meditation as cumbersome, or as a "chore" as you put it - something that no longer fits in your schedule. I would suggest this is all the mind, and your ego struggling to maintain its hold in your life.

I always recommend for people to do a 10-day vipassana course as a way to really solidify a good practise (even if the technique is something you may not use as your main practise). It was of great benefit to me and countless others. If you go [here](https://www.dhamma.org) you will find course listings for wherever you are in the world.

Good luck and I hope you can keep practising :) </TEXT>

Definitely a highly critical vibe, though, but it's hard to compare because I'm a little late to the r/gilmoregirls game, in spite of being a massive fan for 15 years. I wouldn't have wanted to be around in this sub when S7 came out, that's for sure! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Rory and relationships [Revival Spoilers] </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It is truly no wonder Rory has such relationship issues. 

First, she had no consistent father figure in her life. 

Second, her mother was, growing up, the epitome of how to fail at romantic relationships:

* Rory watched her mother abstain romantically for 16 years, then get involved in a string of star-crossed relationships. 

* Max was a trainwreck whom her mother abandoned hours(?) before their wedding day, effectively destroying the step-relationship to which both Max and Rory had been looking forward, and which would have done Rory a world of good.

* Jason's and Lorelai's relationship was mired in deception and then dissolved because of what may or may not have been a serious betrayal to the family.  Another form of betrayal/abandonment, however small.

* Lorelai and Chris have this will-they-or-won't-they thing forever, stringing Rory along in the process for years. Their marriage is a sham and dissolves within seconds. 

* Luke and Lorelai seem oddly fitting for each other, but have *absurd* communication and trust issues all around.


Then there's Rory herself. Her first truly passionate love abandons her, without a word of good-bye no less, and much more directly than the other men in her life. 

In the OS, she seems to be a firm disbeliever in cheating. She is horrified when Paris cheats on Jamie (not just because Asher is 42 years Paris's senior, I'm sure); is harshly critical of Lorelai sleeping with Christopher so soon after her break from Luke in S5or6, and is heartbroken when Logan jumps into bed with multiple bridesmaids even though they were on a break. 

With no resolution with her patterns of abandonment and issues of trust and stability in her life, it is unfortunate but also makes a sad sense that she becomes what she has been so disapproving of in the past. 

Romantically, she is like a lost girl, unsure of how to treat people properly. Also of note, besides Lane and Paris, she has sustained no close friendships either, nor a successful romantic relationship. I hope she can turn it around in this fictional universe. I really do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I totally agree with u/carbler above. People who have rewatched the series 8 times through and still let it occupy a massive part of their consciousness poo-pooing the idea of this book being a resonant, possibly raging success - or at least cult hit - is truly weird to me. Accepting the narrative of the show, Rory is a wildly talented writer, insightful and current. DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO GET PUBLISHED IN THE NEW YORKER AND AS A YOUNG ONLY SLIGHTLY-EXPERIENCED WRITER? I mean, that's Zadie-Smith-level-skill. Hell, JD Salinger was rejected for like 10 years for his Holden Caulfield stuff. ESPECIALLY given that the NYer almost never publishes unknowns unless they hold unbelievable promise and knock the editors socks off. She's got skill, even if she has a poor work ethic with pieces she doesn't care about (i.e., falling asleep during Lines research) and freezes when she's on the spot (Sandee Says). 

She is at the LEAST a very good writer. She is maybe a great writer. Now imagine Chapter X, entitled "They Shoot Gilmores, Don't They?" I would read the shit out of that story. And "You Jump, I Jump, Jack" (and other adventures in the Life and Death Brigade)? "A House is Not a Home"? This is a book most of us have already read and loved, for some of us many, MANY times over. And a talented enough writer can bring this, in a way, MORE engagingly to-life than a tv script-writer, director, or producer. Gilmore Girls is an amazing book. Y'all trippin'. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very "traditional" perspective weighing in: I would say a true yogi is by definition spiritual, as yoga classically means "union", specifically union with the Absolute. Yoga has traditionally been perceived as both the journey toward this union and the union itself. Happiness is a by-product of the union and the mindfulness that comes with the practise. In this sense a true yogi, if not happy, will be moving toward real happiness, maybe slowly, maybe in a two-steps-forward-one-step-back kind of pattern, but on a generally upward slope nonetheless and so, to give a percentage in answer to your question, I guess would then be 100%. I wouldn't call someone a "yogi" just because they attend a couple of classes a week. It's a state of mind and perspective, and the practise of asana is only one aspect (or limb).

I am a practising yogi. I would say my biggest obstacle right now is that I'm not really living in a spiritual environment, and am not part of an in-person spiritual community because of my geographic location. This will change next year, but for the time being it's difficult. But in general, I am happy, and am very spiritual. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Normally, I would say yes, absolutely, sign up today, but this statement gives me a bit of pause:
I am not able to sit idle for even 10 mins

I would suggest practicing some basic mindfulness meditation each day until you can sit for 20 minutes at minimum without discomfort. I've done multiple 10-days and it is **intense**, and it would be best to have at least *some* experience sitting, especially if, after 5 minutes, you feel like you're going crazy. That would not really be the best frame of mind with which to enter the course. Again, it's not so much the never-meditated aspect, but the literally-unable-to-sit-still aspect I would recommend you work on a little first. Mindfulness is a great way to deal with that so you will be better prepared. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Supposedly humans tend to be on a 25-hour circadian rhythm cycle, so sometimes people who aren't working or have a lot of time-specific obligations will "naturally" find themselves staying up later and later until they are in a nocturnal state. This may or may not have anything to do with your meditation practise. 

When morning arises....I kind of go into a panic from all the over-stimulation, especially if needing to go out for groceries and have to drive/be around people (sensory overload)

This doesn't sound particularly healthy. Driving/being around people, unless you're in, say, Manila or some major city in India, should probably not be a "sensory overload."  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you been to a counselor? Speaking to a professional about your anxiety and fears may help you unpack a lot of the issues that have led to you being in this state of mind. Plus an unbiased, professional perspective would serve you well for sorting out what your life or short term goals are, and how to work towards those.

Your life can "change" at any point. You need to put the work in though. The fact that you're meditating is a great start, even if it feels like it's not having tangible positive effects on you. I'd recommend setting up a regular practise time, maybe 1 hr per day, say 30 minutes in the AM and 30 minutes in the evening. If you're awake another 15 hours, then you can't be using it too much as an escapism, can you? - that seems more likely if you meditate whenever you feel like it. But if you're on a reasonable schedule, then you don't REALLY run that risk. Maybe you'll look forward to your sitting times more than you should, but we've all been there too, I bet.

Anyway, back to the anxiety/other issues. When I was 25, I dropped out of my teaching internship because of extreme anxiety. It had gotten so bad I had what is colloquially referred to as a "breakdown" after days of not sleeping and eventually feeling so anxious I could hardly move or converse. I couldn't even find the root of it, not for a while. But I saw a counselor, got a prescription for anti-anxiety medication, took up yoga, started volunteering, and got out of my own "head" for a while. My whole life turned around that year, but I needed to have that unspeakably low point to really instigate change in my life.

Your life can TRULY be whatever you want it to be. Good luck. And keep sitting :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> When you're calm, you should tell your friend the effect her statements/actions/whatever is having on you. Try to avoid blaming her directly -- we all think things like *this person made me angry* or *this person puts me in a bad mood* but it's much more helpful and mature to take responsibility for our own reactions and moods. 

You haven't really explained what she does or says exactly that has this effect on you, so it's hard to comment specifically, but being open and honest about your feelings is a good start. If she genuinely tries to antagonise you or anger you, or doesn't care about your feelings, you may want to look at stepping away from that "friendship." 

Personally, I always take a step back when I feel myself getting angry. I go somewhere and meditate, or if I can't, I just try to focus on my breath, and the feelings in my body without attachment. You have to make a conscious effort to not feed your anger, whilst still accepting it if that's how you're feeling in the moment.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The criminal acts involved must be "motivated by bias, prejudice, or hate" under the new legislation. That by definition means not-an-accident.

<TEXT> That's definitely not what the legislation allows for. You should read the bill. From the summary of the amendment in question, emphasis mine: 

The enactment also amends the Criminal Code to extend the **protection against hate propaganda** set out in that Act to any section of the public that is distinguished by gender identity or expression and to clearly set out that evidence **that an offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on gender identity or expression** constitutes an aggravating circumstance that a court must take into consideration when it imposes a sentence.

This is in no way represented by a case of someone "accidentally" calling someone she instead of he. No judge in our country could do that under the code. This references hate crimes and ongoing, perpetuated discrimination, not an honest mistake. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, that's an interesting and very good point!  From another perspective, though,  when we move toward making citizens legally accountable for abiding by newer social rules, many people tend to make that same type of argument - that authoritarianism is spreading. 

So if you look at with things like laws against workplace discrimination on the basis of race/gender/age, or  how so many American pharmacists run into legal problems in refusing to prescribe medications that run against their religious ideologies, as a more specific example, people who are being held accountable to these relatively new standards tend to argue the same thing and feel very strongly *their* freedom is being infringed upon, that totalitarianism is at work, when in fact these laws aim to protect the freedom of all, freedom *from* discrimination. I can't see anything really coming of these types of pronoun cases, but we are definitely, in Canada, moving toward making everyone accountable for accepting, at least in the public sphere, more modern, progressive views on gender identity.  I think that's a net positive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OP, absolutely don't be held back by this.
I'm a bit like you - I went into my training with a very strong meditation practise and was one of the least physically flexible people in my YTT class. In fact, it was yogic philosophy that really drew me, not the physical aspects of yoga. In my teacher training, we had SO MANY assorted strengths and weaknesses. Some people's main struggle was the pranayama. A few people were reeeeally inflexible. Many struggled, instead, with the theory. Others could hardly sit through our daily meditation sittings at first. Others had trouble with the timetable. Etc. Etc. 

Yoga is about SO MUCH MORE than having perfect-form asana, and we should not worry about being judged by others in our practise, nor should we judge others - especially in a YTT setting! Further, your YTT will enable you to grow immensely in your practise in exactly the ways you need, which may or may not end up having anything to do with those tight hamstrings of yours :)   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think certainly a day-to-day mix could be beneficial, particularly when you're still discerning what works best for you.  For example, personally, traditional hatha is my core practise, but I do vinyasa a couple of times a week, yin 1-2 times a week, and less regularly kundalini and ashtanga; I get different and valuable benefit from each.

If you really want to "feel like [you]'ve gotten a workout in", then you're probably best, well, working out! You mention you have bad joints but even if you're not referring to your knees, you can still work out in ways that are low impact (swimming, using cross trainers, vigorous walking). I'm a bit against the grain here because I was trained in a highly classical style of yoga (Sivananda) and studied under teachers in a tradition that has remained largely unchanged in many decades, if not centuries; more modern approaches to yoga don't always resonate with me, so I'm maybe not the best to advise on your question. 

About the $, yeah, it can be a bit much! Many studios have intro packs, sometimes unadvertised, where you get unlimited monthly classes for a big discount for those new to the studio. But even 1-2 drop in classes a week will make a big difference in your exposure and practise. Good luck :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Power Yoga tends to move very quickly, and most classes I've attended follow a similar structure to Ashtanga, whereas "Vinyasa" classes are sometimes similar to Ashtanga classes, but can vary immensely. Power yoga will feel more like a "workout". 

Personally, power yoga classes are so quick I feel like I'm hardly practising yoga, but then I'm a bit of a traditionalist I guess and have different goals in my practise than the ones you mention. 
I'd recommend going to classes over watching yoga videos while you're fairly new in establishing your own practice. Try a variety and see what works best for you. There's no saying you can't do both, either - or even try other styles too. You may be surprised with what resonates most with you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 8th year teacher now. Right now I'm teaching overseas, living on a school campus so my situation is pretty incomparable, but before I moved I found a pretty good routine. I would always work hard throughout the day and finish my work by 4 or 4:30 then go home. For each meal I would make, I would make sure to have 4 meal-sized servings out of it, so I'd only be cooking supper once throughout the week (at least once during the work week I would do take out). 

Lunches were very simple snack-kind of things (simple salads that took 1 minute to assemble, fruit, cheese, bread/crackers, nuts) or more leftovers. This freed up a LOT of time in the evenings and I would usually either run/workout or do yoga every night, and both saturdays and sundays, so I had 4 workouts, 4 long yoga sessions, and a good amount of free time afterward to chill, see friends, watch tv, whatever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your comments were really interesting and sad and thought-provoking to read. I'm definitely not from a place as rough as detroit, but have taught at some pretty rough schools, including several now-gang members and have seen sometimes sweet kids, with massive potential, slip into lives or violence and crime and misery. To take u/GeneralMalaiseRB's idea a step further: many of these gang members, like the one who survived his accident, more often than not come from terrible family situations, whose lives and choices (rightly or wrongly) seem mapped out from them from the beginning, at least in hindsight. It seems quite likely, ironically enough, that this drunk-riding, reckless, plausible gang member actually had a pivot point in his own life similarly tragic to the sympathy you felt for those mother-less kids. That gang member may actually BE, in a metaphorical sense, one of those children you felt such sympathy for.

And from another angle, often people, when given a new lease on life, especially one that seems unlikely or even miraculous, also take their lives in markedly new directions. Hopefully he was able to use this as a huge wake-up call. Hopefully the mother's children will be OK. There's a lot of apathy in the universe, but there's also an infinity of possibilities too. 

How do we respond to the apathy we encounter? You mentioned feeling crushed by it - which is valid. I'm sorry you felt like that. I like to think of it as an impetus to push me to do more good in the world, to ease more suffering, to remain hopeful and compassionate. The universe may be apathetic - which is the best reason for us NOT to be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Here](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/index.asp) is some information from the government of Canada website on immigration. Most people your age interested in immigrating come to Canada for university - after 4 years living in Canada as a permanent resident (or for 4 full years out of 6, rather) you can apply for citizenship, so in theory you could probably become a citizen in 6-7 years. 

Even if you come to study and change your mind, Ontario has many great universities in either a metropolis like Toronto, very rural areas, and everything in between -- as long as you can afford it, that is -- which can give you plenty of time to decide if Canadaland is right for you while getting a good education.

<TEXT> In addition to INFJHealing's advice, I'd recommend you begin a meditation practise as soon as possible. This is BY FAR the best single practise you can do if you're looking to deal with anxiety. Cardio will help, but it, in my experience, can't hold a candle. r/meditation is a good place to check out if you're a complete beginner.

My other recommendation is to start an asana (yoga posture) practise asap. Pranayama and asanas go hand in hand, and if you go to a good yoga class, you will leave feeling rejuvenated and noticeably less anxious. Pranayama on its own will only take you so far. Meditation combined with a regular yoga and pranayama practise can take you anywhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Love triangles very seldom end well.

Bee doesn't invite me to the Saturday festivities because he doesn't want Dee hearing about them showing up to any of them. This pains me

Have you spoken to Bee about this, telling him how you feel? You are not your brother. You can and should have a social life that does not always involve your brother. If Bee thinks you are a package deal, you should make it clear that his friendship is important to you.

I want everyone to get along, but this situation is impossible to deal with. I hate this drama. 

You want everyone to get along - this is why you're miserable. A situation like this will naturally cause friction and drama. You have not caused the drama, and cannot fix it, nor is it your place to do so. The best you can do is accept it, and that the friend circle you were a part of is, at least temporarily, not going to be the same. You can mourn the loss of it, but ultimately you should accept it. Be a good brother to Dee, and be a good friend to Bee, and it wouldn't hurt to expand your social circle, forming and developing new friendships.

 I have an irking suspicion that the girl is simply milking sympathy out of the two, which has led me to silently resent her. 

I hope this isn't the case, but I suppose that's possible - we don't know her here, after all. Either way, don't resent her. What use is that resentment serving you? Resentment is toxic, for you more than anyone else. Let it go. You don't need to be friends with her, and if she is being manipulative that will come out sooner rather than later. If someone asks your opinion, be careful in offering it, but you're best off letting this whole thing play out and letting go of your anger and resentment.

As a bit of a PS, the language you use in these statements is a little troubling, though maybe you were just being hyperbolic with the metaphor (emphasis mine): 

Here came my brother, Dee, coming to **steal the girl**. For months, they said their relationship was unofficial. Of course, **he succeeded at winning her over, but victory was not without cost.**

Girls and women are not objects or prizes to be won. As a side piece of advice, you may want to ask yourself if this is actually how you see girls, or women. If you do, even partially, this will not bode well for you in your relationship future. This statement too, is troubling: "Dee thinks Bee is being a pansy, because Bee is so upset that "**he couldn't get [the girl] into a relationship with him."** For Dee to think that if you can't "get" a girl into a relationship with someone that makes that person a "pansy", or less of a "man"... well, that's a really unhealthy type of approach too. Again, girls are not manipulable objects. Maybe be mindful of when these kinds of statements or ideas are being thrown around, and if you're being influenced by that type of ideology. </TEXT>

If you don't know for sure, you're not ready. You are extremely young (I'm guessing 17)? And someone who was not raised in the Church, and therefore of maybe a few years' full exposure to Catholicism and the Catholic faith? Just as someone your age is in all probability far too young to marry another person, making the choice to become a nun (which is considered metaphorically marrying Christ) is a MASSIVE permanent decision, one that the vast majority of young women, however strong their faith, are simply too young and inexperienced to make.

What's the rush? You will have your entire lifetime to devote to sisterhood if/when the time is right. There are so many other ways you can live your life over the next several years: maybe enrol in a Catholic post-secondary institution. Study theology. Be active in the Church. Do mission work. Just continue to grow and know yourself and your relationship with God before making this commitment. 

Similarly, your relationship experience when you're a teenager is not a good indicator for your suitability for marriage as woman 10+ years older--you need to thoroughly discern that that is NOT the life you want. 

You can live a life of chastity, poverty, and service in the years while you develop as a young woman, to truly discern what you want. Again, there really is no rush, and if you feel there *is* a rush, that's probably a warning sign that something may be amiss in your spiritual or personal life.

Good luck :)

<TEXT> Even if this man isn't seeing other women, if you and he haven't had the exclusivity talk, then he's not your boyfriend, you're not his girlfriend, and therefore you didn't cheat on him and have no reason to "confess." 

Are you being honest with yourself about your residual feelings for her? In other words, are you more attracted to this woman than the man you're seeing? That might be a bigger part of the emotional cheating that's causing your guilt feelings. But if you are serious about moving on from her, you need to really cut her out of your life.

<TEXT> So you did a 10-day course but decided not to continue vipassana, but mindfulness instead? Why did you make that choice? (I'm not criticising at all, just genuinely curious.) 

To answer your questions: would mindfulness conflict with kundalini? No, I don't suppose so, if only because mindfulness is a bit more of a general and spiritually neutral practise.

would kundalini yoga potentially open up my chakras allowing me to reach the same experience through the breathing exercise that I do?

The breathing exercise you're referring to, I assume, is a a form of pranayama. Pranayama, like the practise of kundalini yoga, will be largely useless and even potentially harmful if you are not on a yogic path already, which encompasses more than just doing pranayama and meditation, especially if these practises are done casually or without a pure intention. 

Re: opening your chakras: your chakras should be "cleared" or "cleaned" before you worry too much about opening them. (Warning: lame analogy ahead, sorry) Think of your chakras like a train station, a station of energy. If the train station is in a huge mess, untidied, hasn't been swept or mopped, trash cans overflowing, it's really not suited to be "open" to the public. It won't be efficient as a station, and will likely end in an even bigger mess. First you need to clean it, purify, then you can think about opening them up. Again, casual meditation and pranayama will not make a lot of progress here -- it requires purifying the mind as well, regular practise of asanas if possible, a sattvic diet, and maybe a change in lifestyle. But what exactly do you want to accomplish? Do you want the rush that comes from unleashed spiritual energy? Do you want tangible evidence of your progress? Or do you want actual spiritual progress?

If you feel comfortable PMing me your city, I'd be happy to help you find a studio/yoga centre that may be near you that could be really helpful with appropriately trained teachers.

<TEXT> Quite a few (probably 50+%) of the vipassana assistant teachers I've met are *extremely* cautious of yoga in general, in how it can "manipulate" energy. Some centres will even bar students from sitting 2nd or later courses if they've indicated they are yoga instructors as well.

The statement you gave about the desire for Kundalini coming from the ego? I tend to agree with that, actually, from a limited sample of people I've met (including some people on r/yoga and maybe even this sub). A lot of people truly do seem to want a dramatic, immediate spiritual experience and power and transformation without putting in the "work." I think that's often a combination of ego and/or spiritual laziness (weird term, sorry) and impatience.

In my understanding, the type of Kundalini practises we see now are modern in the way your teacher alluded to. Classical hatha yoga (i.e., lonnnnng way back), it was believed, did very subtly balance and calibrate one's prana, or vital energy/life force, and in this process, it was believed, kundalini could in an advanced practitioner be awakened. The former happening was a slow but unavoidable effect of the practise of yoga, whereas the latter was very rare. This is what my teachers have taught me, anyway.

Personally, I am a classical hatha yoga teacher and a vipassana meditator, but I am very cautious about kundalini practises and would never recommend to a student who is not very solidly on the spiritual and yogic path already, leading a very sattvic lifestyle, with a noticeably growing taming of the mind. 

PS - I chuckle whenever I hear the "two horse" or "two holes" analogy; it's like a broken record at vipassana centres! But, well, mostly true I think..

<TEXT> Really great question! I've thought about this quite a bit. First, I think there is certainly a way to be mindful when we engage in sexual activity, whether it's alone or with an SO, a mindfulness not unlike mindfulness in other fairly ordinary but pleasurable activities. One important thing a vipassana meditator will do, however, is be careful that all things are in moderation. For a kind of lame analogy, as a lover of chocolate, it's OK to eat it once in a while, of course. But if I need to have a piece every hour, it's already become personally and spiritually problematic. 

Secondly, in saying this:
I m wondering if there is times where masturbating....is bad in terms of used as an escapism of an emotion, stress, boredom

you're kind of answering your own question: If you are aware that when you get stressed/bored you feel the need to masturbate, then you're using it as escapism. Go sit instead.

It may be helpful to ask the following kinds of questions too:

* Am I doing this because I feel a desperate need for it? 

* Is it interfering with my mindfulness -- i.e., I can't focus on X and Y while doing X and Y because my thoughts can't help but gravitate toward sex/the desire to masturbate?

* Am I attached to the practise? If I go without it, will I become frustrated, angry, or irritated? </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are several good warning signs listed here already. The only one I would add would be if the conversation's tone is, by his doing, really heavily flirtatious from the get-go and almost never deviates from that. Learned that warning sign first hand a few months ago.

If you really want to make sure you're avoiding being pumped and dumped, I would recommend waiting until you and he have a) been dating for at least a month b) have gone out with him several times and c) are in an exclusive relationship before sleeping together. 

Most women (and men) really hate doing that for various reasons, but that's truly the best way imo. A man interested in only sex will be VERY UNLIKELY to wait around that long, and will also not lie to you about exclusively dating you unless he's a scumbag which, in my experience, is very rare. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People don't want to hear that what they're currently chewing is cancer causing. There's a time and place to bring those things up, and in the middle of a meal is really not the time, unless they've begun the conversation themselves.

A lot of people truly aren't interested in the cause, or care. You can express your ideas but like you said, you ARE losing mental energy, and you are likely better off accepting that some of your friends will not be moved by your arguments. If you can't accept that, your friendship will turn to shit.

The "leverage" you seek will probably best come from you living your life as you see fit, expressing your ideas calmly and rationally from time to time, and supporting causes you identify with. Getting all angry and emotional over it just alienates people who may actually be receptive in time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Blech.

**(Warning: Purity Plot Spoilers in the following wall of text)**

Critics have dislocated their shoulders throwing expectations on this man and then get upset when his latest novel was not the Great American Novel of the Decade. They measure him next to Dostoyevsky, using a stick they keep neatly up their rectum. If you don't do those things, and enjoy his style of writing, you're the type of person who should read Franzen. But haters gon hate.
 
The criticisms levied in this blog really don't resonate with me. For one, I feel like Sandy English, whoever s/he is, missed the point of the political components to this novel compared to, say, *Freedom*. The politics in *Freedom* (easily one of my favourite novels) were a core element to the narrative, whereas in *Purity* it was more like a moderately key element to the setting. This wasn't really a novel about cyberleaks, or Communist or post-Communist Europe. This was a novel about the characters. Purity is best read as a character study, with a rather brilliant and engaging and compelling and unpredictable plot.

Pip and Andreas, like his other novels' main characters, are vivid, unique, layered, fascinating people and each section in the novel is an intricate study of multiple characters. I loved every minute of reading this book, and didn't feel anything dishonest in the characters' arcs, only some mild-to-moderate and not unwelcome surprises. Andreas's outcome, for example, was neither necessary nor unnecessary. That bit about how unrealistic the post-murder scene was? Of course that scene, and Andreass thought patterns were weird and overblown. Probably 0-2 humans extremely similar to Andreas have been in that type of situation with that type of personality and psychology in the span of human history. Thank you, Franzen, for writing something new and, well, kinda daring. Why should I, and some unknown blogger with an MA get upset when we cant completely empathise with his reaction, with his impulse? If you're even sort of an existentialist, how can you criticise that part of the story? Or any dramatic turn a fictional character makes? Uberdramatic elements aside, Franzen's characters behave often like real human beings: unpredictably, and with a clearly free will. To criticise this novel that (e.g., for something like Andreas's story arc) is, uh, fine, I guess(?) but then the writer is kinda missing the point. Franzen takes *real* risks with his characters: with their backstories, with their psychologies, with their decisions. Thats one of the things I love most about his work.
 
It's also weird to me how this blogger uses the "misanthropic" undercurrent as a major criticism of his work (which is a gross simplification), and then faults him for "sentimental"ity like the ending. In any case, the novel's end is not sentimental. Its honest and vaguely positive and gives a sense of closure. Thats something Franzen usually does in his writing. It feels good. He does it well.  I suspect anyone who doesnt appreciate those last 30 pages is someone who is unfortunately cynical and having a sad life.

TL;DR: I fucking love Franzen and every sentence hes written after, I guess, 1992. *Freedom* is the best but still, 3 *Purity* 3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes! And to add on to your comment about the characters..another thing that is a huge selling point for BCS is that a lot of the characterisation is already fairly set for our protagonist, so there isn't any awkward fumbling as the writers and actor flesh out who the character is. Coming into it, we KNOW who Saul/Jimmy is, on a basic level, and some of the nuances of his character. What we get to see is the journey TOWARD the fulfilment of that character, knowing quite well who he is at the end of that journey. Same goes for Mike. 

Watching the transformation of Walt into Heisenberg was a little unsteady at first, and Jesse's evolution too. For me, it really seemed to be in S3 when their characterisation seemed to hit its own stride, and felt fully honest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's difficult to give advice on this (though it seems like such a simple question), because everyone has different reasons that may inhibit their focus. Generally, the best thing you can do is make meditation a priority and stick to a routine. Every day, ideally the same time, same place, even if it's only for 10 minutes. Once you establish this it will be much easier to slip into that zone, because you've trained yourself subconsciously for that to be your meditation time.

Practising mindfulness in your everyday life is a big help too. Stay present. If you find your mind racing, whether you're making breakfast or jogging or working, bring your attention back to the current moment, and/or your breath. When you're doing the dishes, for example, put all of your attention on what you're doing: the feeling of the water, the sounds you hear, what exactly you're seeing, etc. So often people let their minds run rampant 99.9% of their waking life, even when aware of it, and then wonder why their 20-minute sits every other day seem to be lacking, or don't have much of an effect on their everyday life.

Another thing that is important (which is a little tangential to your question) is not to have expectations about your practise, or become irritated or disappointed if you're unfocussed. This will only hurt your practise.

Hope this helps :)

<TEXT> All of my friends and family noticed the change in me after my first 10-day. The course truly changed my outlook, life and its entire direction.

Everyone has different post-course results and habits. A lot of people I know continued practising for a bit or a long time, but dropped off or stopped over time. Other people keep it up, and other people are so changed by the experience that it becomes a massive cornerstone of their spiritual practise and it changes their lives.

I'd guess you'll almost definitely find your monkey mind quiet down, either a little or a lot depending on different factors. Try not to go into it with expectations, though. It's basically never how you think it'll be. Good luck :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey r/China - I've been lurking here the past several months since moving to China and have been enjoying the show!

I'm wondering if anyone knows how closely conversations are monitored on wechat. I was chatting on the weech with a Chinese friend (in English) about the Taiwan elections, which he'd posted on in his moments, and this led to a general short discussion on democracy. We shut it down quickly, but if we engaged in a good old-fashioned, pro-democracy, pro-freedom-of-the-press, pro-etc. wechat-ersation, are we automatically being monitored? Under what circumstances could anything, well, come of it,short of organising a protest or something? Anyone have any insight into this kind of thing?

<TEXT> This is a very common new age approach - that the energy you "put out" into the universe attracts like energies and that we are continually manifesting our own reality based on our perceptions and what we subconsciously draw into our lives. 

A lot of this has roots in the ideas of karma in Hindu and Buddhist traditions, in that even positive or negative thoughts and intentions are part of the cause/effect cycle of karma, though it becomes a little less classical when you get into new agey stuff like the "law of attraction." The idea of the law of attraction is a bit more along the lines that your thoughts will literally create your reality in real time, whereas according to many Hindu/Buddhist perspectives, karma can take days, months, years, or even lifetimes to "catch up" to us and not in as linear a way as what you seem to be describing. 

Another somewhat popular idea in the new age trends of thought is that there really isn't a psychological/metaphysical dichotomy as you suggest, but that everything is part of one reality where those divisions don't really exist, i.e., that the psychological IS the metaphysical, and vice versa. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Camus was an atheist who firmly rejected the concept of an afterlife, but I'm guessing if confronted with the "reality" of extra-terrestrials, he (like most of us) would accept them as actual beings, without really attaching any spiritual/religious significance to their existence.

This may sound completely neurotic, but when I was a girl I remember seeing a scene or three of The Remains of the Day (the film) which my mom was watching. I have ABSOLUTELY NO RECOLLECTION WHY, but there was something so off-putting about the scenes I have a real hesitation to read the book. I know: weird. It wasn't anything traumatising or even probably remarkable, just an atmospheric sense my 13-year-old brain registered. But I may give it a try.

Your list has a lot of interesting stuff on it. The most captivating book I read that was published last year was Purity by Jonathan Franzen, no doubt. You may like him based on some of your choices. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The [Sivananda](https://www.sivananda.org) Organization has several Ashrams in North America and India where many volunteers go to learn about yoga and perform selfless service be it for a couple of weeks, months, or even years. Usually people apply for a short term stay where you will practise yoga daily, have daily meditation/Satsang, and do service at the Ashram in a very sattvic, traditional environment with experienced teachers and swamis, and then staying on longer is virtually always possible if your intentions are pure.  I'd recommend looking at the website and some of the philosophy behind the organization. It's very "traditional" hatha yoga, with a semi-monastic schedule, where you will also get a lot of exposure to Hindu scripture and teachings. I lived and served at one of the Ashrams for almost a year, got my teacher training in the process, and it was the most transformative and enriching year of my life. If it's something that appeals to you, I'd be happy to answer any questions via PM :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Short answer: YES! You will find that a regular practise will help balance your energy.

Also, in yogic philosophy, you would be considered to have too much rajas, which is a state of overstimulation and overactivity. Though practising the physical exercises, or asanas, will definitely help with that, you might also want to consider adopting some elements of a yogic lifestyle, which would also help (meditation, changes in diet, pranayama). Good luck in your practise :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> lol @ the episode description.

Seriously though... this was generally ridiculous. If they wanted to make this episode about Carrie and Quinn realising they're in love and genuinely want to be together and leave the agency, then they should have done that properly and focussed on that. If they wanted to make an episode on Carrie's family epiphanies/dramz, they should have done this ANY OTHER TIME IN THE SERIES. If they wanted it to be about how Carrie is now truly alone ideologically and personally, then they should have just... done that. But this was messy and boring and felt really lazy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I largely agree with you. S1 and2 were amazing and completely captivating to me, and the psychological-thriller component was a massive part of that. The Brody-Carrie personal relationship story arc added a richness to the narrative that was also very compelling on many levels. Season 3 I found generally enjoyable, but the narrative felt a little unfocussed and messy and Brody's storyline minus the personal drama with Carrie just felt like dead weight. (Controversially, I liked the Dana storyline, but my main complaint would be that it wasn't a tighter narrative, not that it existed in the first place.) Season 4 is lacking the character study that made the first 2 seasons so amazing even beyond the psychological thriller angles, and now that it's shifted into more straight thriller territory, I'm enjoying it for what it is.. but really can't compare it as a complete and layered work the way S1 and S2 were. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Excruciating pain is bearable? Yikes!

I would recommend not rushing. Setting stringent timelines on yourself like this is not the best approach to progress, either for the spiritual or physical benefits. Why the hurry?

But as everyone's said, the issue is opening your hips. Encorporating hip openers throughout the day is the best way to keep your hips open. Do a few simpler hip openers when you wake up, and every couple of hours if possible. Make sure the body is thoroughly "warmed up" before attempting the more difficult ones. Some good ones are butterfly, happy baby (half and full), pigeon, rocking the baby / foot to head, cross-legged forward bends. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did my teacher training at a [Sivananda](http://sivananda.org) Ashram, and would highly recommend it if you're interested in classical hatha yoga. It's an intense 4-week programme that gives a comprehensive, spiritual, classical approach, and is for most people a life-changing experience. Not sure where you're from, but there are teacher trainings worldwide. It's a bit expensive, but worth it. Best to do a short retreat at one of the Ashrams to see if the style is for you but if that's impossible you can get a pretty good feel for the teachings/experience from their website.  Good luck, wherever you end up :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know this post is a bit old but thought I'd weigh in... I have had a few experiences with this. The two times similar to what you describe I'd been asleep, then was drifting in between wakefulness and sleep, with pulsating energy the first time travelling very slowly and methodically up my spine. The second time was more abstract, but involved the same pulsating energy only it didn't really move, just stayed in my solar plexus/heart chakra area. Some visions accompanied this as well, and a couple of times auditory visions too. I kept trying to wake myself up and then move, but it took too much energy and I kept falling back asleep (I guess... it was so fucked up it was hard to tell what was happening). Both times happened while I was doing a lot of meditation (I too have done vipassana courses, two actually, and served a lot too).

I realised that as absolutely difficult and terrifying as it was, the best thing to do was to just "let go", and let it happen without resisting or judging.. observing it as much as possible. And after speaking with my yoga teacher, a very experienced yogi, he told me that I had to practise more yoga asanas, as this releases the blockages that prevent your prana from flowing naturally. Kundalini should be able to flow uninhibited, but when there are "blocks" it can't travel properly, which leads to the more "negative" experiences with what should be positive and wonderful spiritual growth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Meditation is a huge part of my life. Now I meditate about an hour a day. I was drawn to yoga and meditation as a young adult, and they both became very strong anchors in my spiritual/mental/general life as of a few years ago. I think IN types are naturally drawn to practises like meditation as they help us tap into that intuitive and intrapersonal parts of our selves. And it is an extremely helpful way to deal with the monkey mind and anxiety that a lot of us have! </TEXT>

<TEXT> It doesn't really sound like a cult, more like a small and very conservative mini-church, her ties to which sound inextricably linked to her relationship with BF. You don't really mention any practises or beliefs that make it sound cultish per se, just insular. How healthy the church home is depends on factors you don't really address--if your daughter is feeling spiritually fulfilled, if she's happy, if her life has become more meaningful, etc. I don't know if "intervening" is exactly that right approach, but you should absolutely have an honest and open conversation where you thoroughly address your concerns in a loving and non-judgmental way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Coming to r/vipassana to ask this question may yield some kind of biased answers.. but yes, you should! The meals are not really an issue--most find that they are much less hungry, as not only are you very inactive physically, but the meditation kind of, well, lowers your appetite. The hours of meditation (which is 10.75, not 7, btw :) are difficult, but it's supposed to be! AND you will most likely find either some benefit, great benefit, or a life-changing experience if you surrender to the timetable and practise. Good luck :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was basically in this situation a few years ago. Very much wanted to do teacher training with the school of yoga of my choice, but couldn't afford it. Three years later, I can, and am doing it next month! I would say continue your practise, work on being the best yogi you can be (in philosophy, not just asana), and develop as much as you can as a student while saving money. You will then approach your training with more maturity and skill, which will help you. Also, programs under $2000 may not be as comprehensive and established as you'd want. When the time is right, you will be able to do it. And as controversial as this may sound, the fact that you "really, really want" it is in itself plausibly a stumbling block for you. You will learn patience, and perhaps to deal with that craving in a more helpful way. Best of luck :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like your girlfriend is clearly suffering on multiple levels. I would say your first step should be to treat her with compassion and understanding, and love, whenever you can. People who are treated with true kindness and love cannot help but respond positively to it, even if it's in a small or unseen way. When she says hateful or very negative things, you could gently point out the other sides of things, from a place of compassion as opposed to just criticism. 

If you believe that, by responding to injustice with hatred as opposed to compassion and peace, you end up exacerbating the "bad" in the world, it may be helpful to discuss that frankly with her as well to understand her perspective, and see if she can understand yours. It may be, though, that she is not in a place to shift her perspective just yet, which means that at root you may have to accept her negativity/hate as it is if you want to remain with her.  You can't help effect change in someone who isn't ready for it, and learning to accept her fully as she is may actually end up helping YOU grow spiritually in the process. If her attitude is something that is really negatively affecting you, however, perhaps remaining in the relationship is not something you should do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Vipassana centers are run somewhat like Buddhist monasteries. You observe monastic principles and adhere to a very strict code of conduct and schedule specifically in order to accelerate your spiritual growth.  Though many centers themselves use the term "retreat", that's pretty misleading, and it is absolutely for a certain kind of person who is serious about both meditation and spiritual growth. Because of the culture created at the centers, and the focus and intensity of the practise, it can be absolutely and completely transformative within just several days, which would be impossible to experience while living in regular society with a little bit of meditation each day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, because during these courses you're meditating for about 11 hours a day, your meditation progress is very accelerated compared to a 1/2 hour sit each day. It's beyond "intense."  The end result is positive, yes, but the process is EXTREMELY difficult emotionally and spiritually. As part of that process, many deep-rooted issues rise to the surface, and if you're not in a state of stability or mental health I can see how things may be very difficult to deal with, which may exacerbate or reignite a more serious mental health problem. So running, for example, is a great exercise, but if you're not in great shape it'd be unhelpful and probably very harmful to run a marathon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm really sorry to read about this. Vipassana centers can be very strict with these kinds of things, probably due to past experiences with people with certain mental health issues having very serious negative reactions during the courses... The course is very intense and many former issues can rise to the surface during such an intensive bout of meditation. After I sat my first course I heard of people being "banned" for previous mental health problems, practising reiki, and even being a yoga teacher. I definitely WOULDN'T recommend lying on the forms, if only because speaking untruths in order to engage in a meaningful spiritual experience is kind of oxymoronic, and goes against some of the core tenets of the vipassana philosophy in the first place.

I would recommend applying to the center in Montebello QC (it's an hour east of ottawa; i'm actually going to be there in a couple weeks! and they may have a different screening process) and kind of "watering down" your manic episodes.. perhaps emphasising that you were *de-diagnosed* with bi-polar and have been given a clean bill of health and have experienced no symptoms in years.. best of luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to live in serious dread of nearly any social interaction with people who weren't family or close friends. A few years ago I began living in the moment as much as possible. What I mean by this isn't a carpe-diem-lameity, but simply focussing on whatever was happening at any given moment. For me, the majority of my social anxiety was in anticipation--*Who am I going to talk to? What will I say? How will that situation pan out?* I started very consciously trying *not* to do that anymore before and in social situations, and just to stay in the present moment, and focus on my breath. 

When I was with other people, I listened carefully, instead of worrying what I was going to say/do next. And almost every time, things ended up being fine. And if things get awkward? That's OK too. Accept it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reddit is teeming with very vocal anti-equality and narrow-minded users. Though they're not the majority, the fact that they are a VERY vocal minority can create a palpably toxic and unwelcoming environment for people who want to discuss "feminist" issues. Even mention terms like "feminism", "equality", "rape culture," "affirmative action", "wage gap" or "misogyny" in any popular sub and you will be bombarded, downvoted, and attacked. Mentioning that you're a feminist can easily incur as much negative attention as calling yourself a nazi, a racist, or a pedophile. It's a young (old) boys club. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hei Finland!

I am a high school English (Language Arts ) teacher in Canada and am interested in some of the particulars in Language Arts (idinkieli) classes in upper secondary school (or "lukio"). Please feel free to answer any of the below questions with as much or little detail as you'd like.

1. What are final exams like in these classes? Where I teach, usually a final examination would be worth about 30% of the term's final mark, and would consist mostly of multiple choice questions on reading comprehension and a writing section. What is it like in Finland?

2. How do teachers deal with deadlines for assignments? Is it a more permissive system, or are deadlines for assignments fixed and strict?

3. Are classes more lecture based (like university), group work-based, student-driven, or a variety?

4. Are students required to take Language Arts classes at vocational school? How are they different from at upper secondary school?

Thanks so much :)

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your answers! Very helpful and interesting. Upvotes for everyone! </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's so hard to put into words, but when you have thoughts/feelings, to try to imagine yourself as a casual, non-judging, silent observer. Just as you may notice a scene play out in front of you, try to notice what is playing out internally/emotionally/physically. Accepting begins by simply NOT trying to change it aggressively--by saying that was is happening is OK; that it will pass.  I know this is all pretty vague, and I'm sorry I can't explain it much better.

<TEXT> When I first started meditating and studying yoga, I was an EXTREMELY anxious person, and would often have anxiety attacks, especially in the middle of the night. Some were minor, some were very serious. One of the strategies I learned from my yoga teacher was to simply try to *notice* the anxiety happening in as detached a way as possible. I remember one night as I was in bed, my heart racing, panic-stricken, I just tried to very carefully observe what was happening without judging or telling myself to "calm down" (as if that helps anyway). It was like *OK. This is a thing that is happening. Just observe it happen. This is not 'me.' This will pass. Just breathe.* 

I found the key was firstly ACCEPTING the fact that I experienced anxiety. Once you accept it, you can detach somewhat, and it gets so much easier.

On a more general note, meditation combined with yoga was SUCH a transformational thing for me. I attribute most of the disappearance of occasionally severe anxiety with practising these two things, as well as adopting positive thinking. 

[Here](http://www.sivananda.org/teachings/fivepoints.html#meditation) is an outline for the yogic style of meditation that I practise(d), that has been unspeakably beneficial to me. 

Sorry for the ramble. Good luck :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting article. But really, his reason for "why [he's] not a vegan" seems to be that he finds meat "pleasurable" and possibly healthy. He more or less admits that being a vegan is probably best, but that he basically doesn't want to be (not an uncommon standpoint). As for how meat's
concentration of nutrients makes consuming at least some of them convenient and perhaps even smart

um, not really. First, concentration of nutrients? Lol? Compared to refined grains, maybe, but not much else. From what I remember, the most nutrient dense animal product is fish, which is something like 15% as "nutrient dense" as a typical leafy vegetable. Dairy and poultry are about 2/3 as nutrient dense as fish.  Aren't beans and legumes about 3 times as nutrient dense as fish? Unless "concentration of nutrients" means something different than nutrient dense.

Second, "convenience"? What's convenient for the typical western consumer (i.e., driving to the supermarket, picking up a slab of meat, going home to cook it) is more of an illusion of convenience. Are factory farms located thousands of kilometres from where we live, heavily subsidised by our governments and the epitome of waste and cruelty "convenient"? If so, to whom? Such an unsustainable system is convenient only in the short term, to the most privileged members of our planet, and comes at some horrific costs.

<TEXT> As much as I may not like it, I think I would have reacted exactly as Louie's date did in the scene.  There's a cognitive/emotional dissonance there that I recognise, like she did--she even admits that she would have been pissed off if he *had* fought him--it's a very basic, primitive turn-off to see a man emasculated, to be shown possibly unable to defend himself or his dignity.

That said, there are other non-violent ways Louie could have responded that would have been empowering and therefore a "turn-on"--to put the asshole in his place verbally, for example (which I bet real-Louie could do with about 4 seconds forethought). Or to completely ignore him, or diffuse the situation in a way that is in its own way a display of strength of character, brave and strong instead of cowardly and weak. Or a non-grovelling type of pacificism. What would Gandhi have done in this situation? Apart from the absurdity of the idea, I bet he would have handled it right.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're right--problems with things like malnutrition and poor water has much more to do with resource distribution than scarcity. I definitely think there's a moral imperative to reduce the suffering we cause as much as possible. My gut reaction is to say that destruction in itself isn't necessarily suffering--so a person who sweeps bugs from her path or refuses to walk through a field or forest. But on the same hand, insects DO experience some type of sentience, even worms, so I'm not sure how that idea holds up either. 

Maybe it's about trying to find a balance, understanding the connections and making out actions count. Not eating meat might be a necessary action, or maybe just making sure the meat we do eat is cared for in a respectful and environmentally sound manner.

Well said! And insofar as, say, killing a pig for food when there are less harmful, healthy, only slightly-inconvenient alternatives: definitely not permissible. As someone who lives in an urban environment where the vast majority of available food is unethically produced, ESPECIALLY meat products, I can't justify supporting it. I wish there were more sustainable and cruelty-free options, but where I live, there really aren't. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like there's definitely a spectrum of suffering/harm involved. Factory farming, for example, would be at the far end, whereas eating, say, eggs from free-range chickens on a local farm would be at the other end. But even still: is it ever "humane" to kill another being, especially directly?--or rather, it is not always a direct infliction of suffering to kill an animal?

And is it not even harmful to feed grain to animals (which we then kill for food, or whose eggs we consume, or whose milk, etc.) when 1 billion people suffer from malnutrition and do not have enough to eat? To provide water for animals intended for slaughter or food production when 1 billion people do not have access to clean drinking water? I know that these last two examples involve much less direct suffering, but it's my belief that supporting any unsustainable system is harmful, and unethical, from both a Buddhist and general perspective.

What do you think?

What I cannot understand: how anyone who practices *ahimsa*, be it a buddhist monk, a pracitioner of yoga, or anyone else, can otherwise justify consuming meat, and most meat products. There is so much suffering involved, especially where animal products are a product of factory farming, which is beyond nightmarish in terms of the suffering animals endure there, as well as less obvious harm done ecologically, socially, and politically. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you apply as a TA (now called EAs here) I believe that's done through the district. A friend of mine struggled as a supply teacher for a couple of years, applied to be a casual EA in September, and though technically is a casual, works essentially full-time hours. He applied directly through the district, and had a leg up as he had WAY more education than other applicants (i.e., 2 university degrees), as well as experience with kids with exceptionalities, like you. The pay's something like half that of a teacher, but may be a good plan B. </TEXT>

<TITLE> One (last) question: How would you feel about dating this woman? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-05-01 19:11:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi men! This is the last of 10 questions I've been asking this week connected to love and dating. Thanks for answering!

Imagine that youre dating a woman for whom you have strong feelings. She is an attractive, kind, feminine woman, who is happy and busy. You enjoy each others company. She accepts you as you are, and never tells you what to do. 

That said, there are certain unusual aspects to the courtship. For example, though she always returns your calls/texts/e-mails, she does not call, e-mail, or text you out of the blue.  You generally have to take the lead in the relationship.  She has certain principles, like not living with a man before shes married.  She does not sleep with you until she feels completely comfortable, which takes about six weeks.

How do you feel about this? Does any of these things bother you? Any deal-breakers that would prompt you to call it off?

Edit: clarification on the sex comment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you are self-assured and bold, that's a positive thing. Once you become overbearing, or aggressive in your "confidence", it becomes obnoxious and arrogant (i.e., ugly). I love meeting accomplished and ambitious men, and what's an interesting tell is how much time they spend talking about themselves. 

Talking about your accomplishments and life in the natural context of a give-and-take conversation: good. Monologuing/bragging about your achievements: bad. Relatedly, if they're more interested in talking about themselves than asking questions about me, or finding out about me, it's bad for a first impression. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi men! I have a series of 10 semi-related questions connected to dating and love for adult, heterosexual men, but instead of posting a huge survey, I thought I'd post a few at a time so you may be more likely to read and respond. Please feel free to answer any or all of the below 3 questions, as honestly as possible! And if you're wondering what this is all about, I'd be happy to explain in about a week's time.

**Question 7** In general, not specifically with women/dating, do you like a challenge?

**Question 8** All other factors being equal, including intelligence, would you prefer to talk to a woman who is usually light and friendly, or serious and heavy? 

**Question 9** Do you get pleasure from taking a woman out (i.e., picking her up, taking her to a restaurant/event, and covering most of or all of the cost)?

<TEXT> My mind definitely wanders less, and that it's much more under my control. Like when I'm walking, for example, I really "let" my mind wander, but it's much more a conscious thing, like taking specific turns on a path instead of just stumbling through the thought woods, you know? Fantasy and day dreaming are also much more conscious activities. I still do it, but less often, and only after making a conscious choice to do so. 

Interestingly, I never really "noticed" this change until just now. Thanks for indirectly helping me realise this, OP! </TEXT>

**Question 3** You see a woman in a crowded room you really want to meet, but then she seems to disappear in the crowd. Would you try to find her?

I can't even really pinpoint why--maybe it's this kind of understated arrogance, or his smugness, or something else, but on a personal level, I just don't *like* him--so I don't want him to win.

<TEXT> There are even some interesting, more subtle political statements with some of the more "traditionally" feminine characters. Look how quickly Sansa is victimised and abused, her various submissions rendering her both sympathetic and pathetic (in a way). And then you have a luxuriously feminine character like Margaery, who is careful in how she uses her feminine charms and sexuality to her own ends. I'm at the point in the novels where the TV show is now, but you can almost FEEL this power emerging in Margaery, based on that "feminine" nurturing perception of her around King's Landing, combined with this sexual energy she emits. 

The characters are not caricatures, not mere symbols, but full of intricate layers and complexities. Most have traits both "feminine" and "masculine"--whatever those terms mean--powerful in some ways, powerless in others, conflicted, sometimes strong, sometimes weak. In other words: like real people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, any real reply I give will be largely redundant of Daemonicus's points--but to say that he "created the entire world soup to nuts" is not true. It is not fantasy or spec fic in its political structure--it is analgous (and in some ways identical) to the political framework of Europe in the middle ages.  Can we fault him for CHOOSING to use this political structure, instead of a completely new one? Of course not. The sub-genre is MEDIEVAL FANTASY. 

Like D says below, creating relatability is probably part of that choice. As a writer though, he was drawn to that for probably several reasons, some intentional, some natural to his vision. To criticise a writer for choosing NOT to write outside his chosen genre to subvert traditional roles as much as possible seems absurd to me.  Yes, political power of the sexes is an important theme in the series, but it's by no means the only one. If it WERE the only one, OK, maybe a matriarchal setting would have been more engaging.  (MAYBE. I'd have to see that story to see either way.) But GRRM has chosen the best framework to explore ALL of the themes of ASOIAF, and he's done it marvelously. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm for both men's-only and women's-only gyms. I feel that though it seems to be exclusive by definition, the concept is actually empowering and liberating for both genders. I discussed this with an ex-boyfriend a while ago, an extremely modest Catholic man, who expressed that he'd probably prefer to have a men's only section at the gym, or a men-only gym. Though I don't share his puritanical views, I found his reasoning interesting and convincing: he felt it truly distracting to be around women wearing tightfitting, often revealing clothing (revealing figure-wise, not necessarily skin-wise). He felt like this was distracting both from his intent at the gym--to work out--but also distracted him in what he considered to be a moral sense, causing him to struggle with not-staring, not feeling lust, etc. And in general, men DO struggle with lust more than women--it's a more pervasive drive, in ways both subtle and obvious.  

When I go to the gym, I am often and sometimes constantly checked out by men, probably unconsciously on their part. Occasionally I'm leered at. It all makes me feel uncomfortable. Yes, men may feel unwanted attention from women, too, but I'd say the ratio of this unwanted attention that women experience to men is at LEAST 10:1. Whether it's in an aerobics class, or running on a treadmill, doing pilates on a mat, or using an elliptical machine: the movements are sexy, and when women are wearing, say, spandex, or very short shorts and a tight tank-top, it takes considerable energy for most straight men to ignore their instinctive responses to those kinds of things. 

It is empowering to women to allow them the opportunity to remove themselves from situations where they may feel this to the extent that it makes them uncomfortable. But it's empowering and liberating to all of us to also allow men to remove themselves from these situations that make them uncomfortable too (for whatever reason).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's very important to note how Natalia *specifically* responds to Adam. She is in no way "overwhelmed by a drunk man" in this scene.  He tells her to get on all fours. She does. He tells her to crawl to his bedroom. She does. He puts her on the bed, and says he says he wants to fuck her from behind. She says **"OK."** When he enters he, he asks her questions, like if she "really likes" him, which she answers affirmatively. When he flips her over and is about to come on her, she says **No, not on my dress.** So he comes on her chest. The expression on her face is one of displeasure and then disgust--expressions which, perhaps importantly, Adam NEVER saw before they began having sex. Then she expresses that she did not like that," to which he apologises. To even imply that this is rape is so fucking insulting. 

And honestly, *Girls* is a very interesting show. It's a truly engaging character study of four very different young women in New York, full of awkwardness and humour and poignancy. There are frank and sometimes disturbing portrayals of sex and love and desire. I wouldn't discount it for this 3 minute scene, taken waaaay out of context. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To say that 5%, or 1/20, of Canadians are "fringe" or don't matter is ignorant and undermines the very notion of democracy. But to look at it from a more big-picture angle, NDP + Green support equate to 17% of the popular vote, which is about the same as the Liberals'--and that's not counting the one million BQ supporters, whose environmental policies are in between ndp and green. Now we're up to 41% of Canadian voters who do NOT support Liberal/Con environmental policy, which is more than Conservative supporters. But in a democracy, everyone's opinion "matters", whether that translates into a tangible vote or not.  </TEXT>

Great mix of characters, interesting house dynamics, and affably cheesy competitions and dramz. The houseguests are not exactly more down-to-earth, but have a more.. well.. Canadian type of personality, if you understand what that looks like.  A bit... more civil, a bit more like people you'd meet in your everyday life. It's hard to describe.

But one night I was sick and AMC was on, and I was coming in and out of wakefulness (you know, that fever type sleep) and realised that I was hearing some dialogue as good as any dialogue I'd ever heard, ever.  I tried to wake up to watch but fell back asleep instead.  The next morning I woke up, completely unaware of what that damn dialogue had been, but knew I had to watch that show.  Which I did.  Amazing shit.

I agree that a 29% rate of truth-telling is unacceptable.  On the other hand, I think that voting based on a person's political ideology is the best approach, and Obama is a significantly superior choice to Romney. I can't vote in America but if I could I would vote for Jill Stein, not just because she seems to be an "honest" person, but more importantly that she's the only candidate whose political ideas I can truly support. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of good ideas in the comments here.  Here's another: why not try a one-month membership at a yoga studio, then use what you learned there to build a practice apart from the studio?  Then you can get your gym membership and do your gym thing.  Once you learn what you need to from a good teacher, all you need is your mat to keep it going.  

If you're really concerned about calorie-burning a typical hour of yoga probably burns 100 calories, maybe more, while toning.  30-45 minutes of cardio at the gym would burn 300-500; 1/2 an hour doing strength training would burn 200 calories or so.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I pulled this off an buddhism forum a while ago.  I'm not a Zen practitioner, but I do like this interpretation too:
Zen teacher Reb Anderson says, "In the broadest sense, anything we ingest, inhale, or inject into our system without reverence for all life becomes an intoxicant." (Being Upright: Zen Meditation and the Bodhisattva Precepts, page 137). He describes the act of intoxication as bringing something into yourself to manipulate your experience. This "something" can be "coffee, tea, chewing gum, sweets, sex, sleep, power, fame, and even food." ... This doesn't mean we are prohibited from using coffee, tea, chewing gum, etc. It means to take care not to use them as intoxicants, as ways of soothing and distracting ourselves from the direct and intimate experience of life. In other words, whatever we use to distract ourselves into heedlessness is an intoxicant.

<TEXT> A lot of your examples here are interesting, but there are different categories of harm; things that are in themselves more harmful than helpful; and those that in moderation are quite helpful but in excess become intoxicating.  So for you, celery would be in the latter category; meat, fats, complex carbohydrates, etc., would likely belong in the former.  We both agree that many non-chemical things can also be harmful in that 1st category sense, but we do clearly disagree on the chemical stuff.

We are at 2 impasses.  #1: I would go so far as to say all chemical intoxicants (mind- and mood-altering, and/or intoxicating even in small doses to the liver/kidneys/brain) also belong in that first category.  I approach this from the point of view of most interpretations of Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism, but more importantly (personally) from a Yogic perspective, where the things I consume I try to make sure are sattvic (or pure) according to rather clearly-defined principles.  From my personal experience, I have experimented moderately with marijuana and LSD, and to a much lesser extent mushrooms and MDMA; several years ago I made the decision to refrain from consuming these things in the future, for reasons I wont redundantly list again. 
 
When it comes to a lot of things (morality, politics, diet, drug-consumption) Im an objectivist, where it seems that you are much more of a relativist, and/or hold that many important truths are subjective (impasse #2).  The figure-it-out-yourself approach may work for some peopleyourself, for example, maybebut in general I find that approaches like that can be quite dangerous.  Our understanding is so limited, particularly self-understanding, and  I think that drug consumption can be an invisible harm, one that you dont realise has hurt you physically and spiritually.  Just because that harm cannot be immediately (or ever) perceived does not mean it isnt there.

<TEXT> Well, contextually I tried to keep the discussion related to chemical intoxicants since, you know, that's what the post question was asking. And whether this is trivial or not, if a chemical substance intoxicates you, it is an intoxicant.  Yes, some intoxicate in different ways; some are more or less harmful than others; but the precept is semantically very clear. Reject and/or interpret it however you wish.  I agree with you about caffeine, which I consume fairly regularly, and though it is slightly mood-altering, it has no effect on one's judgment (unlike other more obvious "intoxicants"). Other seemingly mild or accepted intoxicants, like alcohol or marijuana, have more far-reaching effects on one's mood, state of mind, and judgment, and are therefore in a rather different category.

Can one be intoxicated by other things?  Certainly.  Power, hubris, sexual desire, greed, fear, etc. And I would agree/assert that these intoxications can all be dangerous and damaging.  But truly, all Ive done is repeat the precept its own simple terms, and yet you seem to have taken my comments personally, then went so far as to imply that Im unwilling to examine my beliefs and am actually perhaps intoxicated by my own ideals.  Neither of those implications is true, and I can't imagine any good will come from arguing this anymore.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't possibly do this.

If she's pregnant, then you already did.  It's done.  If the girl is anti-abortion, then pressuring her to have one because you can't face the consequences of your own actions is just wrong on so many levels.  She can give the child up for adoption; no one's making you raise or support the baby.  If your friends hate you for having sex with this person, then they likely aren't your friends.  Your girlfriend will leave you?  Well, maybe you should have thought about that before you cheated on her.  Good luck. </TEXT>

Some (or many) men come to see women primarily as sex objects, which certainly has a lot of subtle ramifications, one of which is plausibly increased likelihood of sexual violence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are a few important reasons why seats should remain down when not in use.

1.  Defaultness.  For women the seat is generally down for approximately 100% of all toilet functions.  For men, the seat is generally down for approximately 15% of toilet functions (based on an estimation of an average of 1 defecation per day compared to 7 urinations).  This means that, for 55-60% of a toilet's functioning, the seat is probably down.  This makes "down" the default, though I think we ALL know down's the default anyway.  

2.  If the seat is "up" and a person (i.e., a woman) sits on it unthinkingly, the result is messy and uncomfortable and even, from personal memory as a 12-year-old girl, traumatic.  If the seat is "down" and a person needs it up, he will likely notice immediately and never accidentally, for example, FALL IN THE TOILET, which really sucks.

3. Here things get subjective: it looks "gross" when it's up.  Seriously.  It does.  You can very often see things: urine, possibly some poo, and even some mouldy waste matter if the toilet is particularly nasty.  It just looks "right" when it's down.  It does.  You know it; I know it.  Put the seat down. </TEXT>

Then I clicked on the link and immediately realised I've heard this many times thanks to the ubiquity of that film.  Loved hearing it (again) though! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally, I would probably classify as a hindu, but like many religious people, I believe that logic is not a sufficient method to discover the most fundamental truths of human existence; that ultimate reality is fundamentally immaterial and therefore predominantly outside the scope of science.  God/religious truth cannot be found in a closed system, like a tunnel of logic.  Rather, God/truth is revealed to one through spiritual practise, which involves an open mind, an open spirit, and at least a little bit of faith.  

You say you are a scientist, and an atheist, and are looking to understand faith.  Here you automatically have a problem.  Faith involves belief in that which cannot be "proven", but "science" generally disallows belief in that which cannot be proven.  In this search of yours, the first thing you have to be prepared to do is accept that 
a) "science" may not be the best path to lead you to religious truth and 
b) God may plausibly exist, and be knowable to us. 
Only if/when you get to a point where you can accept those 2 things will you be ready to truly begin your search. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm definitely not a proponent of bowing down to injustice, incompetence, or disrespect.   What I was saying is that the worth you extract from teaching is largely irrespective of these things.

<TEXT> I believe I will be happier for having quit teaching. I will make more money. I will have more time. I will no longer sacrifice myself for the sake of others' children. I would like to go back someday when the system finally figures out how lucky it is that people are so dedicated to teaching.

This is a great quote exemplifying why this woman should have left teaching.  By contrast, what schools need most are those who are not looking for great money, and are willing to make sacrifices, sometimes significant ones, for the sake of the children they teach.  Nor should we wait for the system, usually one bureaucratic and corporate-minded in nature, to recognise our worth.  You may not be "recognised" by the administration, the policy makers, or parents, but what matters is the kids in front of you, and being the best teacher you can for each of them, never giving into cynicism or jadedness.  That's where your true worth as a teacher comes from, and its rewards are beyond measure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey. I'm a teacher in a place in Canada that (like mannnny places) is continually cutting back on funding and teachers, everywhere.  One thing I always recommend to people just finishing their degree is to go around to different schools and actually MEET principals in person.  For an administrator, talking to a genuine, enthusiastic person for 5 minutes leaves much more of an impression than a verbal correspondence (like e-mails or letters).  

Here, you HAVE to supply teach, usually for a couple of years, before you can land something more permanent, but supplying at different schools is a great way for administration to get a feel for what kind of teacher you are.  If you're good, and/or have potential, that should be recognised.  And things come up mid-year consistently.  People have babies, get sick, move, and quit, allll the time.  You just finished your masters degree?  WAAAAY too early to throw in the towel.  Make contacts, stay optimistic, and good luck :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was 5, my friend's father, Bill,* began driving us to and from kindergarten.  At least once a week he would drink coffee in the car, which TERRIFIED me as, you know, "drinking and driving" was a surefire way to die immediately.  I tried to convince my friend that she had to make her father stop driving when he drank, but she didn't understand how dangerous he was being.  After a few weeks of this, I told my mother that I didn't want to drive with Bill anymore as sometimes he was "drinking and driving" first thing in the morning.  Hilarity ensued.

<TEXT> I'm sorry that you're struggling so much with this.  That you recognise your ambivalence--and the "poisoning" that is or may be occurring--is in itself very important.  Can a buddhist, or anyone abiding by the principle of *ahimsa*, be employed by a military organisation?  The US military is--and sorry if this is unwanted conjecture--much more served toward imperialism than, say, peace-keeping.  In general it is more violent and destructive than peaceful and constructive (globally/politically).  Ideologically the US military in general is in opposition to *ahimsa*, and while not directly physically harming anyone or thing as a reservist, you are still employed by this institution, and are part of something ultimately quite destructive and harmful to much of the world.  What you may be called on to do in the future may further distress you, and negatively affect your karma.  (If you're interested, there's a short but interesting wiki article on ahimsa, as well as some discussion of Buddhism and the military, historically and ideologically).

You say that you "need" the army to pay for your education and life.  Isn't it truer to say that it is more convenient for you to use the army to pay for these things?  Are there not, in fact, other alternatives that, though perhaps less convenient, would ease your ambivalence, and leave you happier, and freer? </TEXT>

Another perspective is that instead of viewing something as "self-confidence" (which is obviously SELF-centred) you could see it as LACK of insecurity, or the ABSENCE of fear, or anxiety.

<TEXT> The tanning salon "base tan" that a lot of people insist they need before a mid-winter sunvacation really only provides an SPF of about 4, while exposing you to insane uvradiation.. Pretty useless.  Wear a high spf suncreen as per your plan, and what the folks below said. :)

<TEXT> My meditation practise is probably more yogic/hindu than "buddhist", but I try to use mala beads a couple of times a week at least, which I got at a localish general-spiritual-materials store.   My mantra is "OM."  A mantra can be very effective as it gives you something positive to focus on.  It may also be helpful to have a specific space in your house/apartment set aside for meditation, as a) you will naturally slip into "meditation" mode easier and b) after a period of time, it will become infused with a positive energy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As some have implied, as interesting/dramatic an experience as this may be, this Vegan Week may end up looking like a slow-mo car crash.  Your body and mind have become used to a very specific kind of diet and lifestyle, and "going vegan" for a week will probably result in you fantasising about/craving steak and omelettes.  A gradual change in your diet leading up to a Vegan Week in, say, 2 months time, would be a far more beneficial experience, and healthier for your mind and body--and WAYYYY more likely to stick (if sticking's something you'd be into).  I went from being an omnivore to a lacto-veg in about 6 weeks, and if you can commit 2 months to a more organic experiment, that's what I'd recommend. Far easier and more seamless than a cold turkey temporary moratorium on meat, cheese, eggs, fish, and any of the other animal-based shiz you've been eating on what I assume is a near-daily basis for the past X decades.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been wanting to read 'In Search of Lost Time' for ages, but feel immediately turned off by any translations titled 'Remembrances of Things Past.' I know many translators have had their reasons for such a translation, but I just...can't...accept it. I judge the entire translation on the liberties taken with the re-titling. Unreasonable? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm reading 1q84 by Murakami right now.  It comprises exactly half of all Japanese novels I've ever read, but it is beautiful and strange and has infiltrated my consciousness in ways usually only brilliant writing can. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This may contradict or repeat several other comments, but these are my rec's:
*eat either a snack or a small meal 2-3 hours before practicing.  a lot of asanas involve so much abdominal movement you don't want to be either digesting or completely starving (not to mention not having enough energy)
*have an empty bladder and don't drink water DURING yoga unless you really have to 
*listen to your body.  if doing a posture makes you nauseated/dizzy/experience pain/etc, STOP.  go at your own pace.
*focus on your breath as much as possible.  if, like you mention below, you're "panting" then you're pushing yourself WAY too hard.  Not sure what class you're in, but 1.5 hours is a bit long for a beginner..ideally there would be specific beginner's classes you could take that may be exactly what you need. </TEXT>
