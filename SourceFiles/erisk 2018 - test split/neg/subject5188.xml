<TEXT> I haven't seen anything about this story in the media in the past few weeks, and that bothers me a little. I understand there are hundreds of rape cases and that there's bigger news out there, but I don't want this girls death to go over unnoticed. Not that I'm expecting this story to catch any more momentum.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wasn't a huge fan of the Bats v Supes fight, mostly because it really didn't look to me like either of them was actually trying to..I guess, win. The entire fight felt forced to me. From the speed of the actual blows to the space between them, I wasn't sold on the idea of either guy actually trying to win. One of the moments that stands out to me is when Bats grabs the sink to smash Supey with. He slowly walks to the sink, picks it up, slowly walks back, makes a few manly grunts, then drops it on him. It might just be me, but I felt a distinct lack of urgency in that confrontation, which went completely against the drama of Superman trying to save his mother from Lex. 

I think one of the reasons the warehouse fight really works is that it genuinely seems like Batman is trying to kill the mercenaries (which goes against the traditional image of the character but whatever). That urgency is there.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> At the same time, couldn't you say Conor is under just as much pressure and as much scrutiny regardless of belts? He's the money fight, and has fighters from bantamweight all the way up to welterweight (maybe even middleweight) asking to fight him. We joke about it plenty, but he is the champ of the moneyweight division and is in the crosshairs of multiple divisions worth of contenders.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't really agree. I think this was the best Uncharted soundtrack across the board. I thought the action scores like New Devon and Cut to the Chase were very intense and adrenaline fueled, but that the more ambient tracks like A Normal Life, The Lure of Adventure, and For Better or Worse were very strong and stood out. I thought it had a level of energy that the previous OSTs never had. It made me feel like I really was experiencing something special. There were these especially great bits in buildup from ambient to more grand where you can kind of hear the intrigue and wonder and sort of excitement of discovery that I never really heard before in the previous three OSTs. But that's just my two cents.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been detached from games, movies, and pretty much all the shit I really enjoy for a little while. LiS is in a weird place for me where I remember the game meaning a lot to me, I remember it making me feel things, and I remember having learned things from it, but right now I can't remember what they actually were. I've considered replaying the game, maybe refreshing my memory, but (like with other games I used to play often) I can't really bring myself to do it. I think my gaming days might be kind of over. Or I'm just being dramatic. Such is life I suppose. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well Chloe's got (at least) 99 problems, and a bitch is probably one. 

Not that I'm calling either Max or Rachel (or William) a bitch. But all of her pain stems from abandonment. I'm not saying it's the direct cause of everything, but in a butterfly effect sense it is the root. Specifically the joint death and departure of William and Max (respectively). That sent her tumbling down her path. It distanced her from her mother, it made her angry and depressed, it resulted in David entering her life. It led to her smoking as a coping mechanism, which probably led to her trying other more exciting drugs, which either began from or led to Frank, which led to her debt, which led to her getting shot by Nathan. Somewhere in there she met Rachel, which led to her falling in love, which led to her getting manipulated, which led to her plan to leave Arcadia with her, which led to her taking a loan from Frankie, which led to her debt, which led to her getting shot by Nathan. So it's a complex branching path. 

But then again, that's life isn't it? I could say the root of Chloe's problems is the death/departure of William/Max, but that's dumb. Shit happens. Obviously Chloe got played a shitty hand, but you can't pin the blame on anyone or anything. Chloe's problems, at the end of the day, begin and end with her.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that Sacrificing Chloe is the "right" choice, but that doesn't really make a difference to me. I didn't sacrifice the town because I thought it was the right thing to do, I did it because *I* was given the choice. I didn't have to choose the right thing. But yeah, Chloe was 100% willing to die, which really speaks for her character growth, but I was not willing to let her go. It's selfishness at it's purest. Even if there are moral justifications for sacrificing the town, they weren't my thoughts at the time.

Also, completely agree about David. From a writing standpoint he's my favorite character. Very complex, and *thoroughly* misunderstood. While Chloe is a very well written and complex character as well, she's really always framed as one of the good guys. For a substantial chunk of the game, David is the villain. I think that makes a difference as far as interesting-ness goes. Super great character right there (and great performance too!).  </TEXT>

That's a fair point. Even though you can't help but think he didn't deserve to die, he did bring it on himself. He was manipulated by Jeffershit, and he needed help, but it's not like it was one incident that fucked him over. He consistently made the wrong choice, and it ended with him paying the price. Call it karma I guess.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The sane and realistic, and slightly depressing and perhaps boring theory that I lean towards? Max's powers aren't real, and the entire week in Arcadia Bay is in her head; she's just coping with Chloe's death in the bathroom.

The more fun and creative theory? There are old spirits and nature gods that reside in Arcadia Bay, ones from native american legends, that gave her the powers. Max was Arcadia's favorite daughter, and her and Chloe were a perfect duo. When Max left and Chloe's life went down the drain, Arcadia began to crack and decay. The town grew dark and shadows spread. The Prescotts take over. Drug trouble. Wildlife in danger. Etc. Arcadia doesn't have much longer. But then Max, the favorite daughter of Arcadia Bay, returns. These spirits give Max the power and the responsibility of saving the town from disaster, as well as the power to save Chloe and reunite the dynamic duo. Ultimately, they've given Max (and Chloe) a shot at saving Arcadia or, if shit really hits the fan, escape the collapse. 

It's a weird one, but I like it. Makes the story something both more epic and still personal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wouldn't rule it out. But at its core, more than superpowers and blue hair and even friendship, I feel what makes Life is Strange Life is Strange is the theme of growing up. I think having the protagonist be a high school senior and having just turned 18 is a perfect fit for this. While Dontnod could do it with a younger character, it's not really the same is it? How do you tell a story about becoming an adult with a character who's barely even gone through puberty yet? 

Also it might limit them in terms of the material they can cover. Depression, suicide, murder, "DRUGS?", even romance, how do you approach subjects like these (which made LiS stand out from other games' stories) from the perspective of a tween while still giving the player control?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> YES! Me too! That moment is my favorite moment from the whole game. I mean holy shit, the emotions are running so high after the whole alt-Chloe situation, and seeing her again in the morning light with In My Mind playing in the background, and that slow fade in and pan-up shot before you know where you are and if she's there...in my opinion that's the most perfectly crafted scene in the whole game. Even without the serious emotional impact of it. 

But yeah, I was grinning ear to ear for a solid 10 or 15 minutes afterwards. I just stayed sitting on the edge of Chloe's bed for a long time, it was one of those moments that I wanted to stay in forever. The most pure moment of bliss in the game for me. 

I could rant and rave about this one scene all day, seriously, but I've done enough of that over the past 9 months or so. :P  </TEXT>

But yeah, it's very likely that a sizable chunk of the GT fanbase is biased. But that's just the thing about sampling and collecting data; there's always factors that result in inaccuracy.

<TEXT> I'm an N type, ENFP, but I didn't choose to sacrifice Chloe. I know that the theory doesn't apply to everyone, it *is* a theory, but I did find it odd when MatPat began going on about how the intuitive N types were such logical thinkers and were more likely to sacrifice their best friend to save the lives of many while I personally never even considered sacrificing bae. Even looking back now, I don't even entertain the notion of that ending. 

But then again, every time I've taken the Briggs Meyers test (always ENFP) it's always said that my preference of Intuiting over Sensing is very very slight. So I suppose I'm not the best example of an N type. Regardless, "save teh bae." :P 

Loved seeing MatPat finally do a LiS theory though. Been a long time coming! Even if it wasn't about the actual lore of the game, I thought this video was hella intriguing.  </TEXT>

I don't know enough about the Everyday Heroes Contest to speak extensively on it. I just remember looking at when it was announced and thinking that I didn't have anything that I'd be able to submit for it. 

In regards to the EP2 Spoiler Question, I did, and it didn't really impact my playthrough. Like I said above, it impacted my perception in real life, but seeing as I suffered no consequences it didn't significantly effect how I was playing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aw fuck, I wasn't here for the last one! ARGH. I've been slacking in terms of visiting this sub lately, that thing called "real life" has been knocking on my door. Thank you so much /u/armis for making 100 of these things, consistently, every day. They've been hella fun, and have been a great way of keeping us active and talking about Life is Strange (the irony is this coming from someone who has *not* been active for the last three months, lol). You're a boss. 

For my favorite Daily Topic, I'm going to go with the first one I found. [Daily Topic #3: What if Nathan had powers?](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/3xa99d/daily_topic_03/). Nostalgia is a big factor for me, not to mention that topic was something a lot of people had been talking about pre-Polarized. 

My favorite moment from the game is the scene where you return to the original timeline ("the blue timeline") in Episode 4. I've talked at length about it in the past. It was the most emotionally affecting moment in the whole game for me. After all of the heartache and heartbreak and out-of-this-world feels trip that was the Alt-Timeline, seeing Chloe's blue hair again was the most relieving feeling in the world. I was ecstatic, and so excited to have Chloe back. I was grinning like a fool for at least 15 minutes straight after that. And the song, In My Mind, holy shit. That scene is perfect in every possible way to me.

I would try not to rewind, which probably means I'd forget I had the power and would end up accidentally firing it off at times :P

Thank you so much for all the Daily Topics /u/armis! Hopefully you'll still pop by when you can.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One I love to talk about is when you first set foot on the Blackwell campus and the game gives you control of Max and all the time in the world. The ambient soundtrack, the way the light pours over the lawn, it's a very serene moment. It's not a still or frozen moment though, it's very much alive. It's like...active stillness. It's a very soothing thing, just existing in this space with all these other ~~characters~~ people going about their lives.

I also love the subtle changes in Chloe's voice. How she gets super excited when plotting their Portland road trip, or how her voice softens when her and Max are alone.

But the KING of subtlety in LiS is the facial animation. Specifically for Max and Chloe. There's so much subtle detail in the motions of their faces, especially in regards to their eyes. The subtle movements really sell the idea that these are real people and not a bunch of ones and zeroes. They say that the eyes are the windows into the soul, and that rings through here. So much of their emotion is conveyed purely through their eyes. And that shit was hand animated! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes it was very morally challenging, other times it was a split-second decision involving no rewinding. That's a very good thing. It shows that the game actually made me form preferences and made my version of Max grow as a character, but was still able to present me with difficult choices. 

Some easy choices for me were 1) take the blame for Chloe's weed, 2) kiss Chloe, 3) "shoot" Frank, 4) spare Jefferson, 5) sacrifice the town. I didn't need to think hard for any of those. 

Some hard choices for me were 1) answer Kate's call, 2) side with David, 3) stop Warren from beating up Nathan, 4) euthanize Chloe. The last one wasn't as much morally challenging as it was emotionally taxing. 

I did notice my own personal morals changed as a result of the game. Now I feel that the people close to me matter more than anyone and everyone else, regardless of the circumstances. But at the same time I try to be a lot kinder to everyone. It's just that in a foxhole, my friends come before everything else. I don't feel nearly as compelled to act for the greater good anymore. Sounds dickish, I know. I'm not going to bother elaborating further on why I feel this way and the logic behind it, we'll be here all day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It really did. First off, the LiS licensed soundtrack has become daily music for me. I always listen to it before drifting off to sleep, and I'll listen to it throughout the day as well. Can't get enough of it. Secondly, I can't go back and listen to a lot of my old music before. It feels weird listening to the Daft Punk, Mark Ronson, Pharrell Williams, Macklemore   Ryan Lewis and whatever other albums that I used to listen to all the time now. Just can't go back. My music taste changed in the way that I felt I *had* to seek out new artists and new genres of music to listen to. Now I'm a big fan of Fall Out Boy, Panic at the Disco, Halsey, (revived interest in) Paramore, and Lana Del Rey, among others. I don't think there's any real rhyme or reason to it. 

As far as games are concerned, I haven't had the time to play very many games in the last six months. I tried diving back into some multiplayer shooters and some action games I used to love and play a lot of, but they didn't feel that fun anymore. Felt like a chore. However I did have a really good time with the Uncharted 4 beta, so maybe it's like with the music and I just need something fresh. I also played Firewatch, and I loved the shit out of it. 

I'm also oddly more appreciative of movies these days. I've always loved cinema, but now I feel even more drawn to it. Don't know if there's any correlation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Props to you for putting this out there. Even more props to you for overcoming your adversity. The intimacy and relatable nature of the characters really made this story something personal, didn't it? 

For me, LiS was about friendship. It taught me a lot about friendship, my friends, and myself. I don't think I was ever *really* aware of love (but alas, I am still young in the grand scheme of things), but after Life is Strange I started to become aware of it. The feelings I have towards people in my life kind of started...making sense I guess. Specifically towards my best friend. 

But even just in general, after Life is Strange I feel so much more *aware* of who I am. It's kind of hard to put into words.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like one of the reasons Siver was able to last two rounds was because of his kicks. The straight leg kicks, the rounds kicks that made McGregor slip, the body and head kicks, they didn't do much damage but they did seem to keep Conor at bay for a little bit longer. That's why RDA and Cerrone fighting him is really interesting to me personally; those guys are great with their kicks. 

Uh, I'll admit I'm not too sure where I was going with this. Excuse me, I am dumb. 

Nate probably won't come out heavy on the kicks, but he could definitely keep McGregor at range with his reach advantage. I don't think it'll be enough, but I definitely expect McGregor to have more trouble hitting Diaz than most of his past opponents.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not surprising at all. Most of our impressions of these characters are greatly exaggerated. It's funny seeing people rag on fanfic writers when they constantly have Max and Chloe refer to each other by the same nicknames, yet them using "hella/wowser" in every other sentence is totally in character. For the record, I don't mind either. It's just worth pointing out that most of us (myself included) think of Chloe and Max kind of as cartoon characters (not saying they can't be complex cartoon characters).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The supporting character/sidekick/foil always steals the performance acclaim. Look at The Last of Us, Telltale's Walking Dead, any of the Arkham games, etc. The lead is almost never given the same recognition as the foil. 

In the case of gaming, this might actually be an indication that the protagonist's performance is actually really good; you're able to step into the main character's shoes to such a degree that you start to really see everything through their eyes. Hannah Telle, Troy Baker, Kevin Conroy, their performance stops being a "performance". The performance you recognize is therefore for the character you don't play as. In this case, Chloe. Until I actually stopped to think about it I never ever considered how good Hannah Telle's performance was, because I viewed it as my own inner monologue. That's my two cents anyways.  </TEXT>

You'd be able to put two and two together from what comes before and after, so the scene you get to re-experience would completely lose its impact. At least with the ending, it'd be in chronological order so you actually *could* re-experience it. 

But for the sake of a cool answer, I'd love to re-experience returning to the original timeline in Episode 4. It's my favorite scene in the game, and it didn't make me sad. So I'll got with that one. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you ask me, Life is Strange is about a certain tone and style, and revolves around the concepts of relationships, coming of age, and identity. As long as they adhere to those core tenets, it's Life is Strange. It can feature Chloe and Max, established and well loved characters, or a new cast. It can be set in Arcadia Bay, Oregon, or Timbuktu. Whoever, whatever, and wherever the story calls for. Don't give us a new cast just for the sake of having a new cast and milking the IP, and *definitely* don't bring back Max and Chloe just for the sake of bringing back Max and Chloe and milking their already-established characters. 

I will say this though: if they make a second season with new characters, it can't have ANYTHING to do with Season 1. No Arcadia Bay, no significant mention of the storm (if any), NO REWIND, none of it. Just connect it to Life is Strange by those core tenets.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think I was consciously expecting it. Although it was somewhere in the back of my head. Being paralyzed is probably my greatest fear, and my thoughts kept going to what mental state I would be in if I was in Chloe's shoes. In that respect, I guess I did see it coming. It's a crazy moment, and a very real moment. It's one of the most heartbreaking, tear jerking, horrifying, and oddly touching moments in the whole game. It's not my favorite moment from the game, but it's definitely the most memorable. I'm not going to forget that scene anytime soon.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first time you reunite with Chloe. That was a super emotional scene for me. Starts out extremely relieving, then gets worrying, then scary, then tear-jerky, then super touching. The tears be real.

Honorable mentions. 

The Bae ending: I don't care what anyone says, I love the way that ending plays out and I think it's perfect. 

The Beach: Right before the nightmare, after you've saved Chloe. Not much to say other than that it's a beautiful scene. It's a quiet moment with a tornado raging in the background, a lovely little paradox. 

Sitting in the Two Whales: The scenes with Warren and Joyce and Frank are great and all, but the quiet moment you get to have sitting and you and Chloe's booth at the Two Whales is something else entirely. It's the final real quiet moment of the game, and it's the moment when I realized how close we were to the end of the journey. It was oddly bittersweet. Outside the tornado was destroying Arcadia, but inside I had a moment with my thoughts. I stayed sitting for a *very* long time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I love her looks. Her pretty face and unique hair style. Her beautiful, slim body. Her rebelious style. Her cheerful and cheeky smile, which fills my heart with joy. Her both powerful and soft voice, which calms me down.

Yep.

...that's all I really have to say. 

(I lied. I have something else to say.) There's something comforting about Chloe. I find myself thinking about her (usually cuddling with Max or hanging out with Max or something) a lot. Like, first thing in the morning, last thing before I go to sleep, whenever I'm bored, whenever I'm beat down, whenever I'm really happy. I miss Chloe too, but at the same time I don't, because she's always floating around in my head.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought the ending would involve a choice to rewind and save Rachel, and let Chloe be happy with her, but she doesn't get to see Max again. Basically it'd come down to Chloe being happy, and Max not being able to see her, or not catching Jeff/saving Rachel/saving the town but getting to stay with Chloe. I had pondered the sacrifice Chloe/sacrifice town idea, but I didn't think it'd be *that* straightforward. I don't mind though; simpler is often better.

Also, I expected an epic smooch when Max first reunites with Chloe after escaping the Dark Room. I wanted that kiss Dontnod! I thought it'd be an epic moment where Max makes it back, unsure if she made it or not, then she sees Chloe, gets overcome with emotion, and runs over and (determinant) kisses her.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We feel you. You can expect the emotions from this game to be all you think about for a little while. I think I'm past the "emotional wreck" stage, but LiS (very specifically Max and Chloe) is still one of the only things I think about. It's what I'm thinking about when I wake up, and it's always the last thing I think about before I go to sleep. I like it this way though. 

I played Life is Strange twice. Once whilst the episodes were releasing. Then over the 5 days leading up to New Years Eve I replayed the game (quite poetic, if I do say so myself). Like you, I think it's going to be something I return to every few months or so, just to take it all in. Maybe once a year.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think "Season 2" will essentially be a new IP. Max and Chloe's story is over, they've said that. If you made Life is Strange without them, without Arcadia, and without rewind, would it still be Life is Strange?

But at the same time what I think makes Life is Strange Life is Strange is the tone, the art, and the themes. If they make a game with the same quirkiness and nostalgic feel, a similar soft art style, that revolves around the general theme of growing up and discovering your identity, it's the successor to LiS in my book.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think euthanizing her is the right choice. When Chloe rationalizes it, it makes sense. She was already dying, just slowly and painfully. She was costing her parents a fortune, making their lives infinitely harder. And she had just had the best day of her life, seeing her best friend again; she wanted to go out on a high note. But that wasn't really my thought process when I made my choice. I saw the distress she was in, that she didn't want to live like this any more. I then put myself in her shoes and asked myself what I would be feeling. Then I accepted her request. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's how I see it playing out: for a few months, they're both pretty fucked up. They're not mad at each other or anything like that, but they are both badly fucked up. But they're there for each other, so they are able to pull through. I feel like they wouldn't head to Seattle and Max's parents immediately, but after a few weeks they would end up there. That's where they stay for a while.

I'm a Pricefield kinda guy, so after maybe 5 months I can see Max and Chloe properly start going out (and doing other things, giggity). I don't think that the day after Max sacrifices the town they start banging or anything. I get the feeling it would take quite a while for them to get to a place where they can actually fully maintain a romantic relationship. But after that I can see the two of them sticking together. I can see them being together still on January 23rd, 2016, living together and being all cute and shit. Max is chasing her dreams of being a photographer and is finding minor, growing success. Maybe she has a job at a Starbucks or something. Chloe is working multiple jobs, maybe at an auto shop, a tattoo parlor, and/or a diner. 

I feel, like many other, that Max has some variation of PTSD. She's a little paranoid at times. She's more concerned with Chloe's well being than anything else. She hates needles. Nightmares are frequent. Thankfully she has a big blue teddy bear to sleep with. 

Chloe is a lot more positive. She's more active, more ambitious, more generous, more open minded. Her hair isn't fully blue anymore, but she does keep a few blue streaks on Max's request. 

Edit: Also Max has no powers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Returning to the Original Timeline is Episode 4. I wrote extensively about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/3zwkx6/ep5_spoilers_your_favorite_moments/cypxp7g) if you want to read about why, but I'll try and break it down for you quickly: returning to the alt-timeline and seeing Chloe again was the most relieving moment EVER after going through the whirlwind of bullshit that was the ending of Episode 3 and the start of Episode 4. I was so happy in that moment, and I was able to just forget about everything else that had happened and everything that was to come. Technically, the scene is also beautifully executed. This scene was super impactful *in a good way*. 

I feel like too often when we think "impactful", we think about what were the most depressing and tear-jerking moments. But I feel like the moments that had a positive impact on me were far more meaningful that the ones that left me a weeping wreck. Like the ending. The Bay ending is so much more emotional and drawn out and many would say "impactful", but for me the Bae ending is infinitely more meaningful. My takeaway from the Bae ending is so much more positive and constructive than my impressions of the Bay ending, and that means a lot for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this community is so passionate and so awesome because of how Life is Strange hits so close to home. The high school setting. The story of friendship and young love. The issues of bullying and depression. Going through your own Chrysalis. Everyone who plays the game finds something unique to latch onto. It makes the story feel personal. It stops being a game. This community is so incredible because, as cliche as it is to say, Life is Strange is more than just a game.  </TEXT>

It was a fun concept, very well made, had a nice style to it with the comic art bits and the vlog parts, and the story was pretty cool (if not predictable and cliche). I liked most of the characters, despite the fact that the acting was very meh. But then again, Anna Akana was in Ant-Man last year, so what do I know? :P </TEXT>

<TEXT> The "partner in crime-partner in time" quote is super cute.

"Since you're the mysterious superhero, I'll be your loyal chauffeur and companion." 

The whole interaction about Chloe wanting to steal the chair is one of my favorites.

The pool scene is great, but when Chloe tells Max her plan to sneak into the pool is incredibly cute. Chloe with that "impish look" on her face, "splish splash", and Max saying "hella" all combine for cuteness levels over nine thousand. 

But by far the most adorable moment for me was when Chloe photobombs Max's selfie in Episode 3. So *fucking cute*!

I sacrificed the town, and was really happy with my ending; it was the ending I wanted, as fucked up as that may sound. It was the ending I predicted, and the ending I hoped for. I remember watching the final scene, Obstacles ringing through my head, and feeling completely empty yet having a faint smile on my face. When the credits had finally finished and I turned off my PS4, I remember feeling content. Yet empty. It was weird. I didn't really go through a post game depression, but that emptiness still lingered for weeks and weeks. It still comes and goes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> WALL OF TEXT INCOMING THEORY ALERT THEORY ALERT

I think the way the photos work in general kind of breaks the rules of Chaos Theory. It's like whenever Max goes back into a photo, she's in a weird pocket of reality where normal rules don't apply. For example, when Max let's William die in order to the "original" timeline, everything should've been fucked up...or at least different. Why? Because butterfly effect. First, she burned the photo. Then she had a super emotional heart to heart with Chloe, which Chloe would *definitely* remember and would have probably changed certain aspects of their current relationship (you know, considering that her dad dies right after Max tells Chloe that she will never abandon her and all that mushy crap *wipes tear*). Those seem like major changes to the original timeline. My theory is that whatever Max does in these pockets of time doesn't actually have any affect on the timeline. This also applies to what she says. For example, in Jefferson's classroom in Episode 5 you can be super rude to him and make it pretty clear that you're going to bust him (seriously, Jefferson would have to be the biggest idiot on the planet to have not picked up on that), but it doesn't change Jefferson's plans, actions, or attitude towards Max. (Similarly this applies to what Max tells Chloe in the final William photo scene.) The only things that matter in that time pocket are a) Max *giving* him the photo and b) Max *sending* David the text. Similarly in the William photo, the only things that matter are a) hiding the keys and forcing William to take the bus (or not) and b) making a mark on the fireplace. The only things that end up altering the future are not things Max does, but rather things that she lets happen or influences. She can manipulate objects, but her actions and presence seems completely irrelevant. Further "proof" is the final (or second to last for you Bay people *grrr*) photo rewind, when you meet Chloe outside the End of the World Party. Firstly, I know. All Max does in that scene is *speak*, and it changes the future. I know. I said her words don't matter. And this is still true. But I also said that "The only things that end up altering the future are...things that she lets happen or influences." In this photo pocket, Max actually uses her words to convince Chloe to leave the party. She *influences* her. Chloe makes the choice to go, not Max. Similarly to Max convincing William to take the bus after he gives up looking for the keys. Anyways, continuing after that clarification. As soon as they leave the photo, Max remembers nothing she said. What confuses me is what exactly Max *does* remember, but that sounds like a discussion for another time. Max not remembering anything she did in that area is "proof" that her own actions, thoughts, and speech make no change. She herself literally reverts to her previous state, and she's the fucking time traveler! 

So yeah, that's my "photo time-pocket" theory. Everything Max does or says in the photo time-pockets is irrelevant *unless* it results in someone else doing differently *in that specific space*.

<TEXT> I really like Frank. He's a good guy, but he feels threatened. He's at the bottom of the pecking order, and people spit upon him and spur him like a stranger cur (Shakespeare reference, woo). He kind of has to behave prickly, otherwise people would just walk all over him. But he's a good dude. He loved Rachel. He loves Pompidou. He loves beans. Even though their relationship gets off to a rocky start, he eventually comes around to admire Max as a person (if he doesn't die). He's a good guy at heart. He's just in an unfortunate position, and whether it's by his own doing or not doesn't change that. 

As for the morality of selling drugs for students...

A man's gotta eat. I don't think Frank sees any other options for himself. Being at the bottom of the class pyramid can often rob you of hope. If Frank could get a job doing something else, I'm sure he'd take it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  To me Conor looked pretty tired, he wasn't light on his feet, he went completely flat footed and was breathing from his mouth. 

He did. But he looked pretty off his game right out the gate at 189. I distinctly remember watching that fight and thinking Conor looked really, really fatigued from the jump.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Glad that you mentioned stepping onto the campus for the first time. The serene moments like that were awesome. They weren't serene and peaceful because they were still, they were peaceful because they felt genuinely alive. You look around the beautiful school grounds and see an assortment of characters all doing their own thing. A lot of games are described as having worlds that feel "lived in", but LiS is the only game world I've ever been it that feels like it is *being* lived in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My favorite moment is when you return to the original timeline in Episode 4. The scene is *incredibly* well done. The muffled music, "In My Mind" by Amanda Palmer, playing in the background begins sounding creepy and a little ominous and soon changes into the most joyous song you've ever heard. The opening shot of the pirate drawing is initially confusing, a little unfamiliar, but as it comes into focus it evokes a feeling of nostalgia. The scene still hasn't been set, and you're left wondering what's going on and whether or not you've fixed everything. The camera turns to Max, looking as disoriented and worried as the player. Then the camera slowly pans up. The music comes into focus as soon as Chloe's blue hair enters view. The swell of the music is times perfectly with the grin that spreads across Max's face as she turns around, as well as the swell of our own hearts. Max runs to Chloe and wraps her in a tight, awww-so-sweet hug. And naturally, Chloe responds in the best way possible: with her trademark dry humor and sarcasm, "that beautiful pissed off face". It's the perfect way to assure us that we're finally home. The scene instantly transitions into one of the game's awesome sit-down scenes where you can stay frozen in time for as long as you want. The warm colors and morning sunlight streaming in from the windows reinforces the feelings of hope and home. It's one of the best executed scenes in the entire game. 

And for me, it was also *the* most emotional moment in the game. I've talked about how the main takeaways and emotional effects I got from the game are positive, and this scene takes the fucking cake. I remember the sheer emotional brutality of the first act of Episode 4, and I was *so* worried that I'd never see my Blue Chloe again. The scene opens and builds the tension like I described above, but then it all dissolved the second I saw that blue hair. It was the most relieving moment for me in the entire game, even more than saving Kate. I remember just sitting there grinning from ear to ear for minutes and minutes on end, even after the song ended. In that moment, everything else melted away. Rachel, Kate, Nathan, David, the binders, the alt-timeline, as well as everything going on in my own life, it all just disappeared as I got to bask in this moment of pure unadulterated happiness. It wouldn't be an exaggeration for me to say that it was one of the happiest moments of my entire life, and it's not like I've had a shitty life or anything (a relatively short one maybe). I can't remember ever smiling so hard (my face hurt). It's something that I won't ever forget about. It was also the moment I swore to never let Chloe go again. 

Even if you didn't read through that whole blahblahblah (understandable), I'm sure my excessive fawning over the scene shows just how much I love it. 

RUNNER UP: This is a funny one. The scene when you return to the Blackwell campus in Episode 4 and bump into Mr. Jefferson is fucking awesome. It's a scene that really highlights the quality of the dialogue and characters. It's the first real instance where Jefferson seems like a real person, and a genuinely likable dude at that. It's another positive moment where I forgot about all the darkness surrounding Arcadia Bay. The scene contains the single spoken interaction between Jefferson and Chloe in the whole game, and it is AMAZING. The light flirting, while creepy in retrospect, is hilarious. Chloe telling Jefferson that she's Max's date for the Vortex Club party is one of my favorite lines in the entire game. And of course this line: "Besides, you don't want to see the old hipster trying to keep up with the kids." This scene is just awesome. Then the subsequent banter between Max and Chloe (fighting over the sexy teacher) is also super cute. It's honestly one of the most human moments in the entire game, and that's saying something! Makes me long for a timeline where Jefferson isn't secretly Jefferdouche.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> That would've been a ballsy move, and methinks potentially a lot more meaningful. But at the same time, it wouldn't be right to take the game's most important mechanic away from us during the final choice. If Life is Strange's choice mechanics were more passive and not bound to "pick A or B", then it might work. Games that have good and bad endings attached to kill counts kinda work along those lines; you're (generally speaking) not actively making the decision to get the good or bad ending. But for an entire game where we've been presented with this very specific and binary, active, method of making choices it wouldn't work to remove player agency at the very end.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems to me that Rachel was just confused and stuck at crossroads. She falls in love with Frank for the content of his character. She falls for Jefferson because he's the key, or maybe the door, to her success and career as a model. Then her best friend Chloe becomes infatuated with her, and when Rachel doesn't feel the same way she fears hurting her best friend. The Nathan Prescott becomes infatuated with her. Looking at it this way, I think she was just in a really difficult position where there was no right answer. I don't think she was a manipulative bitch. I think she was just like everyone else, she had problems in her life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> But what'd be the point of that? There are plenty of interesting situations they could put Max and Chloe in, but most of them would be pretty pointless in regards to their evolution as people. Let's take your idea: Max gets kidnapped, Chloe has to go all super-Chloe and save her. What's the message? What's Chloe's character arc? The point isn't to write them into a story, it's to write a story *around* them. 

Also, I'd say that Chloe has very much grown over the course of the game. At the beginning, she's bitter and wants to "drop a bomb on Arcadia Bay and turn it to fucking glass". At the end, she tells Max that there are so many people in AB who deserve to live more than she does. If that's not growth, I don't know what is.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They're 100% right. As much as we want to see them again, Max and Chloe's story is done. It wouldn't be worth bringing them back just to get another five episodes out of them (though I would definitely enjoy that). That said, I'm not really sure what the second season would be about. I can't see how or why Dontnod would make a sequel/second season that is still Life is Strange. I feel like a second season with a new cast would essentially just be a new IP in the same genre.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  For Chloe, her story ends in a bathroom of a high school she was expelled from, after a father whom she loved was killed in a car crash, with a step-father that she hated, whilst oweing a drug dealer money that she borrowed in order to try and find Rachel, the love of her life that she doesn't even know is dead, and, to top it all off, without ever again seeing the friend who seemingly abandoned her all those years ago.

This was precisely why I couldn't make the choice to let her go. Chloe deserved better than that. Yeah, everyone in Arcadia Bay didn't deserve to get obliterated by the storm, but I couldn't and still can't bear the idea of Chloe dying alone in that bathroom. Alone.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The shy/introvert posture comments are probably right. Dontnod put lots of work into characters' mannerisms. For example, without talking to her you can see Chloe's confidence (and that it's probably a defense mechanism) from how she carries herself. The way Max holds her arm, and often anxiously looks around while she's doing this, does point towards introversion. And we already know that she's an introvert, so that's that. 

Buuuut coming at this from another angle, your comment that pose having to do with shoulder pain got me thinking. Max is a relatively skinny and frail looking individual. Her clumsiness, build (compared to Chloe's more lean and muscled frame), and awkward running suggest that she isn't a particularly active or fit person. And if you look at Max's posture, she tends to slouch a little. Not drastically, but a little. Her shoulders tend to hang forward, and her back is often bent. This is the case with most people. Most of our lifestyles (even regardless of how often you work out or whatever) involve a lot of sitting down, hunching over computers and books. In the long term, poor posture can lead to things like back pain and shoulder (rotator cuff) pain, but even young people can suffer minor irritation of this kind. So based on these assumptions (which is really all this is), it's very likely that Max Caulfield might actually suffer from some kind of minor/moderate shoulder pain. It doesn't help that the weight of her bookbag is constantly coming down on that shoulder. 

BUT, that's probably not what Dontnod was going for when they worked on Max's animations and mannerisms. Go with the introversion.

<TEXT>   The final choice, then, is a culmination of that idea: is your version of adulthood about sacrificing the things that matter to you (sacrificing your dreams so you can get a good job/raise a kid/whatever), or are you willing to be more selfish in the pursuit of the things that you really care about (in this case, Chloe)?
Personally, the latter resonates more with me. I hate stories like Knocked Up, that endlessly reward their protagonists for giving up their individuality in the pursuit of "real" adulthood, which always means giving up all the shit that matters to you so you can be a True Man Who Takes Care Of Shit.

Wise words, whether you agree or not. Personally, I do. 

 Also, I'm not gonna let my sister die in any game where she's a character, so there's that.

The one criticism I have is that it's hard to tell who's who in that final exchange between the Caulfields and the Prices. I know Max can't see them, but she *can* hear them. A little bit of clarity when it comes to who's talking when would've helped. Loving it otherwise, excited for the next one! </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Question 5:**

Where Max's powers came from is never really revealed. Some people say it was the universe giving her more time to be with Chloe. The visions of the storm would be the universe reminding her that, at the end of the week, she would have to let Chloe go. That only really applies to the Sacrifice Chloe ending though. It's quite poetic and touching though. 
There's also the possibility that the whole week happened in her mind, and dreaming up a last week of adventures with her best friend was Max's way of coping with her death (and her own guilt). That would mean the rewind powers never existed. 

I think that the powers and the storm are metaphorical, and we aren't supposed to take them literally. I don't think the week was all a dream though. I think the game is about Max deciding what kind of person she wants to be, "coming of age", and I think using time travel powers was the best way Dontnod had to tell that story. 

Then there's the possibility that the "spirits" of Arcadia Bay gave Max the powers, hoping that she could save the town. Arcadia Bay had gone to hell in the 5 years Max was away, under the effects of the Prescott family. Maybe when Arcadia's favorite daughter finally returned, and reunited with her partner, the spirits gave her (them) the power to save the town. Or, if the cost was too great, to save themselves. This could also explain the visions; the spirits were warning her of the impending storm so that she could prepare. There are a lot of references to spirits and Native American legend in the game, so something like that really wouldn't surprise me. I'm being vague as hell, I know, but that's all I got at the moment. 

The last two are the ones I like best. I may have also pulled all of these out of my ass.  </TEXT>

I just think he's the most shallow character in the game. The funny thing is that before Episode 5, I think he's much more 3 Dimensional. We see that he is driven, yet carefree. Supportive (of Max, he's an absolute turd to Kate), yet stern (in class). He's rumored to have had sex with students before, but when Victoria makes her proposition to him he outright rejects it. He's a hip, famous photographer, but he also calls himself 'an old hipster'. Pre Episode 5 he had a lot of charm and charisma, and I feel he had more depth as well. Then he turns out to be the villain and just...becomes a stereotypical villain. The unused dialogue hints at more behind his character, but what we saw was incredibly 2 Dimensional.") </TEXT>

<TEXT>  More than anything else, Life is Strange is an incredible use of the medium to tell a story we dont really get to see in games. 

I'm always happy to see people write this about Life is Strange. One of the game's best aspects, if not it's best aspect, is that it tells a story that you couldn't effectively tell in any other medium. Being able to rewind time and change the choices you make works perfectly with the themes and fuses narrative and gameplay into one entity. It's a beautiful and refreshing thing to see in a time where games need to you commit dozens of mass murders before they can show you an emotional moment.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This conversation has been a lot of fun. Thanks for, uh, conversing! Hopefully we'll be seeing you around this sub in the future. 

There's no other game quite like Life is Strange. If you're looking for games with moral choices/conundrum's, play *The Walking Dead: Season 1* or *The Wolf Among Us*. If you're looking for the nostalgic vibe of LiS and a Pacific Northwest setting, try *Gone Home*. If you want a game with an atmosphere as rich as LiS (though different), play *Red Dead Redemption*. And if you want an equally strong story driven my the relationship between two characters that also poses some really deep morality questions like the one we talked about, play *The Last of Us*. And for a story about the touching friendship between two girls, play *The Last of Us: Left Behind* (*Gone Home* also falls into this category). Those are the best recommendations I can give you! </TEXT>

<TEXT>  For me/my Max, it felt the complete opposite. Sacrificing Chloe made me feel guilt, a deep sadness, but no regret. I think that, in the final ending, as she stares out into the sunlit bay, Max feels a deep sadness, but does not regret her choice. She feels sad, but in a way, contented.

I believe guilt is related directly to morality. When I (or rather, the user I quoted) say Sacrifice Bay = Guilt, I'm suggesting that Max feels that she has made the morally wrong choice. Which, in the grand scheme of things, she has. But if she sacrifices Chloe she doesn't necessarily feel guilt, because she has made the morally right choice; she feels regret. Regret is more personal, and in this context maybe more selfish. She'd regret giving up Chloe because it is worse for herself. 

I totally feel you your last point. Every single character in the game feels like a real person. Almost everyone has some kind of character progression and some kind of life that goes on independently of Max's, and also everyone has secrets that they hide. It makes them feel incredibly three dimensional. So yeah when that final choice comes, it's hard to think of Arcadia Bay as a bunch of lines of code. It feels like a real town filled with *real* people. I also feel you on the point of Max being able to easily empathize with others. Especially with her powers. She can see the different sides to everyone. She can see the good, the bad, and the ugly in everyone. If anyone, Max would have the resolve, nay-the ability (did I really just say "nay"? I feel like Prince Hamlet right now) to make the selfless choice. 

But to be entirely honest with you when I look at Max, from my own lens or from a distance, I don't see this perfect and selfless heroine. The fact that there are so many choices in the game that can be broken down to "selfless vs selfish" is reasonable proof that Max is internally conflicted about her morality. She stops and considers different options, justifying each for herself. Her moral compass isn't definitively righteous. She's not a superhero. She's a very real person with normal character flaws. She often wants to take the selfish route but knows that, based on everything society teaches us, it is right to take the selfless route. The age old conflict of feeling vs thinking. (It's worth mentioning for your side that when she initially gets her rewind powers but doesn't have a personal stake in the decision, Max acts selflessly and heroically in the bathroom in Episode 1. Being selfless is Max's true nature. That supports your side, and I'd be a doofus to deny it.)

It's a very complex issue, and it goes far beyond the confines of our monitors. It's a hella deep morality (and even psychology) conundrum. All arguments about it run in an infinite loop, as this sub has most certainly seen over the last two months. </TEXT>

Sacrifice Arcadia Bay = Guilt

<TEXT>  Because let's face it. We humans can relate more to our closest friends / families / loved ones a thousand times more than anyone else.

There's a character in the movie "Interstellar" (which I will not spoil) who says:

*"...it would be (impossible) to get people to work together to save the species instead of themselves. You never would have come here unless you believed you were going to save them. Evolution has yet to transcend that simple barrier.We can care deeply - selflessly - about those we know, but that empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight."*

And he is so brutally correct. "Interstellar" has a team of astronauts searching for a way to save the human race from the impending death of the earth. And although the mission is to save mankind, the main character is driven *solely* by the hope of seeing his children again and saving *them*. He's not trying to save the human race, he's travelled across the galaxy to save his family.

The final choice in LiS echoes this quote: *"We can care deeply - selflessly - about those we know, but that empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight."* Looking at it this way, the writers at Dontnod were actually pretty generous in even giving us the option of Sacrificing Chloe. Very few people would be capable of choosing that option in reality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with you. I think the Bae ending really is a case of "less is more". I've seen some of the fan edits that include the kiss and some more dialogue and stuff in this ending and, while it was nice, it never really felt right. The kiss is the big one. Before I played Episode 5, a YouTube thumbnail spoiled for me that Max and Chloe would/could kiss in the episode. I went in with that expectation (pricefield trash), and that left me initially disappointed with my ending because there was no kiss. But looking at it later, now, that would have been *so* out of place. 

I love the Bae ending though. I think they showed us just enough and just the right things. I honestly think it's perfect.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Why is it when people are in a certain mood they go straight to music?

Well, not everyone does. But yeah, most of us seem to do this.

What it is literally is knocking out your sense of hearing to disconnect you from your surroundings. When you've got your earphones in (or the music turned up really loud) the sounds of the world around you are completely drowned out, therefore disconnecting you from the world and taking you somewhere else. Call it escapism. Sometimes you'll just close your eyes to do this. But more often than not we turn to music, because music has the ability to convey emotions. I don't really have an answer for why music can evoke certain emotions (it's probably got to do with certain frequencies and vibrations that hit the brain in just the right ways, I dunno), but it does, so we use it to take ourselves away from reality.

Would've been nice if some of this side of Jefferson made it into the final cut. He came across as a very 2-dimensional villain in this episode, so even a little pinch of dialogue like this could've made his character feel a lot more fleshed out. These lines are actually perfect in that they give you a reasonable glimpse into his motivations without turning into a stereotypical villain monologue.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seconded. It's incredibly atmospheric, has one of the best soundtracks (both original and especially licensed) you will ever hear, touches on some very poignant, relevant, and relatable issues, and features some excellent characters. Every single character in the game begins as a walking stereotype, but by the end they've all become real *people*. </TEXT>

A lot of it has to do with your personal situation, what kind of scenario you were born into, your experiences, etc. There isn't some general equation for success that applies to everyone. He's right when he says that you can be whatever and whoever the hell you want, but just know that hours upon hours of grinding isn't what gets you there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To my knowledge, the lighthouse was the only part of Arcadia Bay that wasn't in the storm's path. It wasn't explained all that well prior, but in the Bae ending you can clearly see that they're safe from the storm at the lighthouse. In the first vision, I believe Max says that she has to get to the lighthouse. Somehow, she knows that the lighthouse will grant her safety from the storm. How she knows that, I got no clue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I honestly have no complaints about LiS. It has flaws, both technically and artistically (not the right word at all, but fuck it), but none of them ever bothered me that much. The only obvious aspect that I'd like changed, or more accurately improved upon, is the lip syncing. It wasn't a problem for me most of the time; the only instance where it did pull me out of the game was in the most important moment, the final choice at the lighthouse. It wasn't a major inconvenience or anything, but it's a little nitpick.  </TEXT>

As for songs, I say roll with Obstacles, Mt. Washington, and Spanish Sahara. Those three are essential.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **YES**. Absolutely **YES**. It's been thrown out there before, but this is the first time I'm seeing a post about it. I think it's one of the biggest themes of the game, present from the outset, and a HUGE part of building up the world of Arcadia Bay. In Episode 1, we are introduced to a series of stereotypes; the typical nerd, the bitch, the rebel, the drill sergeant, the rich kid, etc. We see little glimpses of depth, but for the most part they are nothing but caricatures. But as the story progresses, we begin to gain insight into these characters. We start to understand Chloe, we start to understand David, we start to understand Victoria, and we start to understand Nathan. They stop being 2 dimensional. By the end of the game, there are no more stereotypes. We are left with *people*. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've never really been much of a shipper. I respect all ships, but initially I didn't really ship anybody. As time went on though, I started to fall into the idea of Max and Chloe being together. It was just a natural progression for me, it wasn't intentional at all. That's just what I saw their relationship evolve into. Now I'm all "Pricefield 4eva". 

Other than that, I don't really ship anyone. There was no other pairing I saw that seemed natural. I'm sure Warren and Kate would be super cute, and Max and Victoria would actually be great, but I never saw them as natural character/relationship progressions. That's just how I think about things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Life is Strange inspired me to pick up the phone and call my best friend (who I had been away from for 5 years) too. I saw a lot of parallels between the relationship of Chloe and Max and the relationship of me and my best friend. It's what actually got its hooks in me and drew me into the game. It made the story feel very personal. I think everyone found some kind of parallel between Max's story and their own story, and that's why we all got so damn attached to this game. </TEXT>

Where were they mentioned? I've never heard of them before. 

Anyways, I agree that everything in Arcadia Bay will just be a reminder of Chloe. I'm just questioning whether or not that would make Max want to leave. It could go the exact opposite way that you're saying; maybe Max will never want to leave Arcadia Bay because it's the only connection she has left to Chloe.   </TEXT>

You're the first person I can recall hearing (reading) this from. And you are 100% right. I've recently been pulled out of my "ermagerd LiS is over my life is void of meaning" phase by necessity, and it doesn't feel good. While you're under it is emotionally draining, but it's also kind of nice. It's weird not having been constantly thinking about Chloe and Max for the last two or three weeks. All I want to think about is the good times we had in Arcadia Bay, the lessons learned, all the memories. I guess what I'm saying is that I just don't want to forget.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends entirely on when he gets the ability to rewind. I think he's too far gone by the time Max gets her powers; if you gave him the ability to rewind during that week, it'd probably turn out to be the straw that breaks the camel's back. I don't know a lot about mental disorders, and I've never really tried to look into what Nathan might be suffering from, but I'd say his perception is already pretty fucked up; having the ability to create alternate timelines might make him completely lose his grip on reality. 

Now if you gave him the power at an earlier stage, maybe before he was under [EP5 SPOILER](#s "Jefferson's") control (he's not his loyal servant, no, but he is under his control), he might have ended up using the power for good. He might have saved Rachel, he might have rebelled against [EP5 SPOILERS](#s "Jeffershit"), he could have used the powers to impress Papa Prescott, and he probably never would've ended up holding Bae at gunpoint. Maybe.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The main idea is still the same, right. But I get the feeling that in the original script for Episode 5, it wasn't. When I say "changed direction", I'm referring to dropping the threads that you listed in the original post. I get the feeling that with all the things that they were building up to, Max's personal journey, which is the core of the game, would've gotten swept aside. They wouldn't have been able to give us the (relative) quiet time to stop and think. The whole episode would've been plot, plot, plot, and no reflection. The change of direction that I see is, more accurately, Dontnod recognizing that they *had* changed direction and were losing sight of what their story was originally about. I don't have any evidence for this, it's just what I gathered after months on this sub and then playing the finale and what I feel in my gut. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think we're saying more or less the same thing. Where we differ is why they changed direction. You think they had to change direction, I think they wanted to change direction. But ultimately you're right, it does all come down to the money. 

This has been a nice discussion. Hats off to you for your theorizing, and thank you for being respectful. I hope I haven't been bugging you with this. :) </TEXT>

It's fine if you don't like Life is Strange; I get that it's not a game for everyone. But what you can't deny is the game's originality. It's different, and it's beautiful for it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since you're the smart one (*jesus christ those screenshots*) I'm not going to completely disagree with you, but I just get the feeling that they completely wrote themselves into a corner and that's why so many of those threads were abandoned. And yeah, the writers aren't making the executive decisions, but I doubt the game directors and producers (maybe not Square) would've rather forced them to put out a game they weren't proud of. The writing team does have some influence.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for writing this, and thanks for doing all this research. You're one dedicated motherfucker alright. :) I have a different idea as to what happened with Episode 5. Bear with me? 

So I think you are 100% right in regards to all the plot points and elements you listed above being removed. I think there's no denying that there was initially WAY more to Episode 5's story than what we got in the finished product. Sean Prescott, Nathan, Samuel, and all the supernatural business going in on Arcadia Bay, *especially* in regards to the nature of Max's powers and the storm. I believe the original script was going to delve deep into these areas. 

Here's where you and I differ. I don't think Dontnod and Square decided not to put money and effort into completing the original vision. Surely, if it was what they had planned out from the beginning, they would've been able to fund it with the original budget? ***I think what happened is the writers had a complete change of heart.*** Think for a second, what has Life is Strange *always* been about? Max and Chloe. The relationship between those two characters always took precedence over the mysteries of Arcadia Bay. But then all these other elements began to be introduced. The supernatural, the Prescott conspiracy, etc. I can't help but remember the period of theorizing that followed Episode 4 and how worried I was that the finale would be a convoluted mess. Even looking at these loose threads now, after much though, I have absolutely no fucking idea how they could have been integrated into the story in a natural manner. And that's the thing, I think the writers realized that they had bit off more than they could chew. There was no way they could answer so many questions, reveal every secret, conclude the conspiracy AND maintain the emotional center that was Max and Chloe's bond in a way that worked. I think the original script for Episode 5 was almost completely abandoned late in development. That's where I think the money went: I think they may have been maybe half way through Episode 5 before realizing that what they had wasn't working. I think the reason Episode 5 felt rushed and kind of cheaply made was because they literally rushed through it's script and had about 50-60% of the budget for the episode left. I genuinely don't think they hung us out to dry; I think they wrote themselves into a fucking corner. They got swept away in the amazing world they had dreamed up and forgot what their focus was. How could they have balanced the emotional roller coaster with the winding plot (in just one episode)? I think ultimately the writers chose to abandon the story of Arcadia Bay in order to focus entirely on giving us a worthy conclusion to Max Caulfield and Chloe Price's journey (or at least their best attempt at a worthy conclusion). I think they chose between a rushed, shaky ending that stayed true to the core of the game, and a fleshed out and polished episode that tied off all loose ends but lost sight of the original themes. 

As for the Hospital Ending, the third ending? I think they had just completely run out of resources after pulling a complete 180 midway through development and had to sacrifice one of the endings. Max wasn't the only one who had to make a hard choice and sacrifice something important.  

**TL;DR** I think Dontnod wrote themselves into a corner with the mysteries of Arcadia Bay and were forced to pull a complete 180 mid-development in order to focus on the game's main themes and characters. As a result, they didn't have enough $$ left to flesh everything out fully. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I know exactly what you mean. After spending the better part of a year in Arcadia Bay I started to feel like Chloe (not as much Max, I kinda *was* Max) was a real person, and a friend. Having them be gone just like that...was kinda jarring. As much as I love my friends and have always loved my friends, I used to think I was a lone wolf. Or at least that I could be a lone wolf. But now I see things differently. I don't want to be alone anymore. I think it's something that I've always known, but something that I never really admitted. My friends are my everything. 

Returning to what you were saying (I may have went off for a second), I'm right there with you in wanting a "soulmate" (I prefer partner in crime and time, but whatever). It could be in a romantic sense or in a best friend sense, or both. I love my friends, but sometimes I feel like there's gaps between us. Like I can't really talk to them. Or, more accurately, like they can't talk to me. Even in the case of my two best friends, I feel like there's just this distance between us (in one case a mental/emotional/personality distance, in the other a literal distance called the Atlantic). It's something I've been thinking about a lot lately, just like you I suppose. 

This is the aftermath of the feels trip called Life is Strange I guess. Thanks for putting this out there. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Speaking for myself...yeah. You hit the nail on the head. I'm a guy, and I wish I could have a friendship like that. I'm already pretty bromancy (for lack of a better term) with my best friends, buuuuuut I wish it could be a little more. I'm not concerned about coming off as "gay" or anything, that doesn't really make a difference to me and I'm not insecure about my sexuality or anything like that, I just get that most other guys including my friends aren't comfortable past a certain point. But I don't know, I'm pretty weird. 

I do feel like that line is slowly dissolving though. The bromance (what's another word for it?) levels today (at least in my experience) are a lot higher than they would've been ten years ago. We're learning to leave behind the arbitrary gender role stuff.

Having Max and Chloe as female protagonists is great because they can have that open relationship without having to hold up these dumb macho masculinity masks that so many of us guys wear. They can actually talk and be open with each other and bond and be adorable and shit. If they were guys, they might have been a bit more awkward and tentative.  </TEXT>

 Almost all fan art has some sexual overtone.

I don't think you can deny the sexual tension between Max and Chloe. Just watch the pool scene. Now does that mean there has to be romance between them? Not necessarily. Doesn't change the sexual tension. 

But yeah, Pricefield is generally the most attractive and accessible ship, which is why so much of the fanbase is cuckoo for ChloexMax. Myself included. It's not denying that other ships are valid, it's just a popular preference I guess.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think it's necessarily the Bae ending, it's just some people not respecting others' totally valid opinions. But what do you expect, after we've been "Polarized"? I can recognize the reasoning behind choosing to sacrifice Chloe, but I'll never really understand it. That's why I chose to sacrifice the town. But like I said, I can still recognize that there are valid reasons for picking the Bay ending. End of discussion, everybody's happy?

Probably not, but fuck it. If people be hatin on you, tune it out. There are more nice people here than douches.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure. "Love at first sight" is kinda bogus-ey, but there is truth to it. Some people just click. Not to be all cliche sappy and shit, but when I met one of my best friends for the first time I *felt* that we were going to be really good friends. And friendship is just another name for/form of love. That's all I'm saying.

Well, actually all I was saying was that Max is less weirded out by Warren and more just scared by her own insecurities. Just as with Chloe in the nightmare (in her underwear, taunting her, making out with everyone but her), that wasn't Max's subconscious perception of Warren (or Chloe). That was her fears and insecurities in regards to him. And fears and insecurities are often irrational (in the case of her fear of Chloe not being interested in her, that turned out to be *completely* irrational).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's made me value the people around me a lot more. I used to believe that I was on my own path, that I didn't need anyone else (though of course I enjoyed my friends' company), that I could take on the world alone. Life is Strange made me realize that we all need friends. Everyone needs a Chloe to be able to confide in, to talk to, to experience both the good and the bad with. You can't walk this walk alone, and neither can they. My relationships with my two best friends (one is a Warren, one is a Chloe) have improved, become more open and more comfortable. Life is Strange taught me a thing or two about love...and that's a pretty powerful thing.

But more importantly, I've started saying "hella" a lot. I've also developed an affinity for beans, and I've become very attached to said beans. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think an important thing to point out is that *Max is not afraid of or disgusted by Warren*. She says in the "Go Ape" entry that he's like a brother to her, and we see over and over again that she genuinely appreciates him and confides in him. She's either **a)** just not sexually attracted to him, or **b)** she's just intimidated by the idea of a relationship like that (I think we can assume that Max has never really dated anyone or done anything, so it's completely understandable that the concept would be scary), and that's why Warren's presence in her nightmare is what it is. Max isn't weirded out by him, she's weirded out by their relationship being something different. *That's completely normal*. If you're already friends with someone, it can be hard to have that friendship change into something else. We can even see a bit of that in Max's journal in regards to Chloe: on the final page of her journal Max actually questions the nature of their relationship, whether it's friendship or something more. 

Point is, Max still loves Warren. He is her dear friend after all. I personally don't see what you might call a "romance" between them (Team Chloe, sorrynotsorry), but Max certainly does care about Warren and appreciate his company.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It doesn't scare me, but I do think I understand better now that you have to just accept your actions with complete conviction and keep on moving forward. But for me personally, Life is Strange was an external introspective experience (if that makes sense; it was an outside look in) that taught me a lot about love, friendship, how important the people around me are, and my own morality. After Life is Strange, I'm more grateful for the friends I have and I appreciate them more. I was always a very up front type of dude, but now I'm just a little more emotionally open and honest with people. In a weird way I feel exposed, but also less scared than ever. Of anything. 

I don't want to end up dragging on too long, so I'll leave it at this: Life is Strange taught me a lot on so many different levels, and I feel like I've actually matured as a result.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the movie Interstellar, Anne Hathaway's character mentions how love is something that transcends time and space in a kind of inexplicable way (well, it probably can be explained, I'm just dumb *and* paraphrasing). It draws McConaughey's character across the galaxy back to his kids, and [MINOR INTERSTELLAR SPOILER](#s "Hathaway's character to her boyfriend, who was on another planet"). I think Life is Strange gives us something similar. Max and Chloe's lives are forever intertwined; across all the different timelines and realities, they're pulled together by love, or maybe "destiny". Whatever you interpret their love as, it's something very powerful. The best evidence of this is probably when Max gets her powers in the bathroom. Max gets her powers when she sees Chloe get killed by Nathan, but at the time she didn't even consciously realize who she was. Maybe her subconscious recognized it was Chloe, or maybe she "felt" that it was her through whatever bond they have, but either way that was enough for her to summon the ability to rewind time. That's enough evidence for me to suggest that their bond can't be broken. *Especially* following the week they just went through. I can't see them splitting up again. Whatever the hell they do moving forward, wherever the hell they go, they'll always be together. 

And in terms of the Bay ending, I like to think that there's some kind of dimension or reality beyond our reach where Chloe is watching over Max from. Once again, Interstellar style. A reality where Chloe has all the memories of their last week together in Arcadia Bay.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fuck, Max getting kidnapped, drugged, and violated by Jefferturd had completely slipped my mind. I thought the Bay ending was fucked up enough already; this really does change everything for me. She needs someone to be able to talk to and confide in. Having to bottle that up alongside everything else... 

Fuck me, I hadn't even considered that trauma. You just blew my mind, Jesse. Like, there's a hole in the side of my skull and all mah brains are dripping out of it.  </TEXT>

In the first episode you think you have everyone figured out; bitchy girl, douchey drill-sergeant stepdad, evil rich kid, etc. But then you start to see other sides to these characters. We start to be able to understand their positions. They stop being good or bad, and they just become...people. Real people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) I agree, its pretty weird how Warren just instantly believes Max. If my best friend came up to me and told me he could rewind time, I wouldn't believe him immediately. That's hella crazy. But keep in mind, Warren *is weird*. And not necessarily in a bad way. He's obsessed with Max (once again, not calling him a creeper, put down the pitchforks for now), and he *always* has her back. Warren's the kind of guy who would take a bullet for Max, even if she wouldn't do the same for him. In that respect, I think it actually makes sense for his character that he *does* believe her. That's the kind of person that he is. The conversation is too brief though. 

2) I loved the hallway sequence. I understand how it can get tedious, but I remember being completely immersed in the sequence. I was scared, worried, angry, regretful, reflective, and I was just walking through an empty freaking hallway. I thought that sequence was great. The stealth was a little odd looking back, but I didn't have a problem with it at all. It felt like a dream alright. 

3) I love the Bae ending. I love everything about it. Initially I was a little disappointed by the brevity, and later I thought about the nature of "Obstacles" being re-used, but I still really liked it. Now I like it even more, having thought long and hard about it. I think they showed us just enough, even though I can practically see the budget constraints jumping out at me. "Obstacles" is still a perfect song for that scene, the dialogue and hug under the lighthouse is GODDAMN PERFECT (I know it isn't our Pricefield kiss, I was initially disappointed at that too but then I realized it would have been out of place), and the ending shot(s) is beautiful. I love the overall feel of the scene, and also the prospect of a fresh start and implications of Max and Chloe's future together. *That said*, I woulda really liked one last dialogue tree. Let me break it down for you: 

*In the truck, preparing to leave what remains of Arcadia Bay. Chloe turns to Max, a somber yet hopeful look on her face. You have four prompts.* ***1) Are you ready?*** ***2) Where to, Captain Chloe?*** ***3) I'm sorry Chloe.*** ***4) I love you.*** *This results in a brief one or two lines of dialogue from Chloe (and possibly another from Max (***"When a door closes, a window opens"***)). Chloe smiles warmly at Max, a gesture which is returned by the brunette. The partners in time turn their gaze to the road ahead of them, as they begin to drive off into tomorrow.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like a cop out saying this, but I think Max's powers are nothing more (and nothing less) than a narrative tool. *Life's about choices; what if you had the power to change those choices?* It's about who Max is, and who you are, as a person. Time travel presents us with the ability to mold ourselves into the people we choose to be. 

Part of my logic behind this is that, if you wanted to turn Life is Strange into a novel or a movie or any linear form of media, you would have to omit her rewinding abilities. Yeah, that would completely *kill* it, but how would you write in that rewind power while retaining the core themes? The story isn't about time travel. The inclusion of rewinding strikes me as DontnoD taking advantage of games as a medium for the story they wanted to tell. But once again, that's just my thoughts.  </TEXT>

We don't get any info on where Sean Prescott fits into all of this or where Max got her powers from, but I can't really imagine either of those things were on Max's mind at the time. I kind of like the story where questions are left unanswered; it would be strange if every single loose end (and god there are a lot of them) got tied off.

<TEXT> I also feel like I can connect with Chloe (a lot of us do; thank you Dontnod!). But I haven't gone through with the loss and grief that she has. I relate with her in a different way. Chloe Price is a person who always has her armor on. She's cocky, confident, snarky, stubborn, passionate, independent, and often difficult. She gives the impression of being a strong and badass woman; she is a strong and badass woman. But underneath her armor is a more sensitive, wounded person. She wants to be loved, and she doesn't want to be alone. Chloe feels like the world is working against her, trying to take everything from her. I feel like I can relate to that. I'm brash, I'm cocky, I'm confident, I'm independent, but it's a direct result of being burned before; the armor goes up to protect myself. It's not pretend, just like Chloe's persona isn't pretend (and just like Jay Gatsby's persona isn't pretend; amazing character, but I digress), but it is concealing something. We get to see firsthand how sweet and cuddly Chloe whenever Max is around; she's like an excited little puppy. Not to mention how she pines after Max (her texts in the Alt. Timeline for example). I don't usually let it through, but I'm exactly the fucking same. I'm a romantic (hopeless romantic), sappy little puppy who pines after his best friend who he hasn't seen in years too. But there's only really one person who brings that out of me too. Otherwise I always have my armor up, just like Chloe. It doesn't mean I can't be myself, but it means I can't let anyone in. By spending time with Chloe, I got to understand myself in a way I never did before. My persona, while 100% real and 100% me, is entirely armor. 

That got a lot more long winded than I wanted it to be, and also kind of sadder than I wanted it to be. I wasn't coming here looking for sympathy, so I apologize if it came off that way (plz furgiv mee). But yeah, Chloe Price is my spirit animal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I may have been the only one, but I never really wanted to know how Max got her powers. I understood it as being more of a narrative device than anything. The story was, to me anyways, always a personal journey. That doesn't mean the journey is all that matters though; the destination is hella important. And with that in mind, I don't really see why people are so upset with the two outcomes. In terms of the personal journey that Max goes on, both destinations are excellent (narrative sense, not how it makes you feel). And the path to them is also excellent. Sure, some of the time travel logic gets *really* inconsistent towards the end, but is that really what we should be focusing on? (not that I'm trying to tell you what you should focus on, this is just my opinion)

At the end of the day, I don't think Life is Strange is about time travel. Time travel is just the tool DontnoD chose to use to show us something greater, and it's a tool that was specifically chosen *for the interactive medium*. 

Just my two cents. :) I do understand why some people felt cheated by the conclusion.

<TEXT> I liked how mundane, and frequently *unceremonious*, things often turned out to be. My favorite example is the death of Nathan Prescott. Some people seemed really disappointed at his death off-screen, but I thought it was brilliant. He was so *unceremoniously* removed from the equation. No fanfare, no buildup, no last hurrah. He was just gone. It was brutal. Real life often works like that. That's a message that I felt LiS drove home a lot. With the death of Rachel too. We have all these wild theories and insane plots in our heads, but at the end of the day life is usually not so dramatic. We don't always get the storybook ending.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't stop thinking about it either. I don't want to do anything other than just sit and remember and daydream about Arcadia Bay. 

The finale had a weird effect on me. Like everyone else, I was feeling kinda empty after ending the story. I was reduced to my roots, which are Life is Strange, calisthenics, the Gameovergreggy show, and my best friends. At first I thought I just didn't want to do anything that didn't have to do with Life is Strange. I didn't want to play any video games, I didn't want to listen to any music (sans the OST), and I didn't want to watch any TV or YouTube or anything. Then I realized that I just didn't want to listen to or watch or play anything that I had *before* playing the finale. I want to leave all my old stuff behind and not look back. I only want to listen to *new* artists and watch *new* shows and play *new* games. I chose the [EP5 SPOILER](#s "bae") ending, which is very similarly about taking what's most important to you and leaving the past behind you. I dunno, it's...weird. I don't know if I will ever go back.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I put up [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/3tcwwc/ep5_spoilers_rank_the_episodes/) yesterday where I asked people to rank the 5 episodes. This is what I had to say: 

 **1. Episode 3:** This is why I love Life is Strange. Max and Chloe, back in action. Getting to sleuth around Blackwell with them and beginning to uncover the truth was great. This episode gave us some of my favorite interactions between Max and Chloe. We start to see them develop as characters and come to understand them better. The pool scene and waking up in Chloe's room are awesome. I love this game for the positive emotions it stirred up in me, and this ep is my favorite because of that. Playing Episode 3 I finally started to realize how much I had fallen in love with these characters and this world. The cliffhanger ending blew me away, and I realized what depths I was willing to go to in order to save Chloe. To me, this story is all about Max and Chloe, and this episode epitomized that. Not to mention I discovered this sub after playing Episode 3. :)

My second fav was Episode 4, but I actually considered putting Episode 1 in the number one spot because it's the most chill and the most atmospheric (in my opinion). To be honest, I have viable reasons to put Episodes 2, 4, and 5 in the number one spot as well. It's just a great game all round, and each episode is a progression of the previous one.   </TEXT>

Besides, it would be plain *cruel* to bring someone like Max into the real world without Chloe. If I can't bring them both, I'd bring neither.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually totally agree with you on your points on Episode 1, and the general tone-trajectory of the series. However, as the game progresses you get to watch the characters slowly become people, while in the first episode they're not much more than stereotypes (but that's not a bad thing). Maybe that's why I like Episode 3 the best: it's right in the middle, where the characters have started to become real people and the tone is still for the most part pretty light.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [EP5 SPOILERS] Rank the episodes </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-19 00:09:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Simple yet difficult: rank episodes 1-5 of Life is Strange (season 1) according to your personal preference. Spoiler tagged so that we can freely discuss the episodes without hassle. Sound off below, I want to see what all of you guys think!

Short List: 

**5: Episode 5**

**4. Episode 1**

**3. Episode 2**

**2. Episode 4**

**1. Episode 3**

Now with more detail.

**5. Episode 5:** I loved every second of the finale but it is still drastically different from the rest of the series, and lacks some of my favorite things from the previous eps; it's got a very different tone and a distinctly different atmosphere. I'd like to stress though that I still *love* this episode, as with all the others. This was a hard list to make.

**4. Episode 1:** This is hard. I considered putting this in my number one spot. At this stage in Life is Strange we had no idea what the game was actually about, and I love that. We got to explore Blackwell and meet new faces with a clean slate and no worries. 

**3. Episode 2:** I also considered putting this at number one. Fuck it, I also considered putting the next one at number one. The Kate story is incredibly emotional, and this is when the greater plot of Life is Strange begins to be revealed. But I love this Episode for it's dope intro sequence (the best in the series in my humble opinion), and for the extended period of Chloe Price and Chill. I love that diner scene. This episode hit both emotional highs and lows, and it balanced them really well. 

**2. Episode 4:** This episode was just something else. We finally began to uncover the dark secrets of Arcadia Bay, characters showed their true colors (Warren, Nathan, Frank, Jefferson, Victoria), and we got to play detective while listening to Sparklehorse and Amanda Palmer (and it was AWESOME). But I love Episode 4 for its first act in the Alternate Universe. Like with Episode 2, this sequence hit such highs and lows. Getting to be with Alt-Chloe provided some of the most heartfelt and fuzzy feels in the whole game, but then punctuated them with some of the most depressing and guilt-inducing ones. The Euthanasia scene is one of the most powerful scenes in the whole game, and it's something that I'll never forget. *See you around.*

**1. Episode 3:** This is why I love Life is Strange. Max and Chloe, back in action. Getting to sleuth around Blackwell with them and beginning to uncover the truth was great. This episode gave us some of my favorite interactions between Max and Chloe. We start to see them develop as characters and come to understand them better. The pool scene and waking up in Chloe's room are awesome. I love this game for the *positive* emotions it stirred up in me, and this ep is my favorite because of that. Playing Episode 3 I finally started to realize how much I had fallen in love with these characters and this world. The cliffhanger ending blew me away, and I realized what depths I was willing to go to in order to save Chloe. To me, this story is all about Max and Chloe, and this episode epitomized that. Not to mention I discovered this sub after playing Episode 3. :) </TEXT>

They don't represent the Democratic Party, or the Republican Party. They represent the Party of Love. The first time the United States will ever have two First Ladies.

<TEXT> I can't say you've given me a new perspective on Life is Strange, but I did enjoy reading your review/impressions. This game really is incredible. The amount of detail in everything, from the multi-faceted characters to the beautiful world, is astounding. You hear a lot of people saying how "lived in" Game X's world is; Life is Strange isn't a game that feels "lived in", it's a game that feels like it is *being lived in*. I've never ever set foot in a fictional world that feels so alive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I finished the game last week, and I'm still finding it really weird to think that Life is Strange is over. I was happy, not heartbroken, with my ending, but I'm still filled with this odd emptiness knowing that LiS is done. Like, I don't really want to do anything else right now. I don't want to play other games, I don't want to listen to other music, I don't want to do anything that isn't LiS related. It's weird, and it will probably pass. But Life is Strange felt like a huge part of my life for most of 2015 (and the best part of my life for most of 2015!), so having it just be finished is so...weird. 

Regardless, I wouldn't trade it for the world. I'm glad to have had these memories and to have spent the year in Arcadia Bay.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The big failing of TLoU was an inability to choose an ending, despite the fact that it really seemed like you should have been able to.

I disagree. The Last of Us is not meant to be your story; it's meant to be the story of Joel and Ellie. Instead of letting you control the characters, it puts you in their shoes in order to allow you to *understand* them. No matter how much you like or dislike the ending, we can all understand why Joel did what he did. It would have been incredibly out of character for him to go the other way. 

I think the game's biggest failing is how forced some of the combat is. Some of it is *extremely* forced, and some of it feels super organic. It's so strange; that "ludo narrative dissonance" is at both its best and worst in The Last of Us.  </TEXT>

Fun fact: I was convinced that the climax of Episode 4 would be Nathan shooting up the Vortex Club party. I was pretty surprised that a school shooting never happened at Blackwell in the game; it's a growing issue in the world today, and I can see a lot of things they could have done with that idea.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd probably be just as invested in the characters, if not more invested. What initially drew me (a guy) to Life is Strange was a parallel I saw to my life in the relationship of Max and Chloe: I haven't seen my own best friend (also a guy) from my childhood for five years. Being Max and getting to reunite with Chloe was like me getting to see my bestie again. So male protagonists wouldn't turn me off; it'd probably make the game feel even more personal than it already does. And if they were gay? Well the way I see it, love is love. I don't really care. Platonic, romantic, it's all the same love to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't have any qualms with the ending(s) of LiS, but I'll admit that I have been let down by some other games this year. As much as I absolutely adore Until Dawn, I was disappointed with how its "butterfly effect" actually worked, and that there's really just one ending (though it's the only logical ending to a story like that, but still). Arkham Knight was a game that had my hype levels through the roof and, while I did enjoy playing the game, I was burned badly by both the story and the content (screw those AR challenges, they done effed it up). So I totally understand the feeling of being let down by something that had you so pumped up. But when it comes to Life is Strange, the story mostly went where I wanted it to and I got the ending that I've wanted since the beginning.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> What inspires me? Jeez, I didn't think I'd have to be thinking so deep tonight! I feel like a self-motivated and self-made person most of the time, though I've started to learn that this concept doesn't exist. I am who I am and do what I do because of the people around me. My environment is responsible for who I am, even though I feel like I'm always fighting my fight alone (and I'm content with that). When I think of the people who inspire me, I can only think of people on the other side of the screen. There's my childhood best friend who I haven't seen in person for years, who inspires me every day because he's still my best friend (love is a powerful thing). Then I have my role models who inspire me. They're not people who I want to be just like as much as they're people who I respect and have learned from. They range from Markiplier to Conor McGregor to our very own Max Caulfield. I'm inspired by the adversity these people have overcome and what they stand for. They all inspire me to be a better person, to work harder, to love, and to be myself. When I think of my friends, I think of my best friend and Markiplier and Greg Miller and Chloe Price. They're always there for me in my mind. 

But most of all I find inspiration and motivation in the horizon. I believe every single one of us has unlimited potential. I'm always looking beyond, dreaming of doing awesome things and *knowing* that one day I will make my dreams into reality. The prospect of the future inspires me. 

Anyways, that's a look inside my mind. Hopefully that's enough good feels for ya OP :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the top contenders for Game of the Year are Life is Strange, Until Dawn, and MGS5. But I still understand that almost all of the praise will be directed to the *huge* AAA big budget titles (MGS is among them). I'm not saying games like The Witcher, Arkham Knight, and Fallout 4 are bad by any stretch. I just don't really see them as being game-changers (pun intended). LiS, Until Dawn, and MGS are the three games I've seen this year that try to boldly go where no game has gone before. I think they deserve recognition for that, and I don't think "Games for Change" really stresses that enough. But that's just my two cents. :)

For reals though, why wasn't LiS nominated for Art Direction and/or Soundtrack? The art of LiS is beautiful and gives Arcadia Bay a very distinct feel (one that we don't get a lot of in games); and the soundtrack isn't just amazing, it's really well implemented. I can't think of another game off the top of my head that makes use of music so well for setting tone and conveying feelings.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know I'm arguing for it, but I hate it too. I didn't pick the Bay ending, and I never will, so I don't actually accept this as a valid theory. It's just my only way of making sense of the Bay ending, because there are a lot of variables and inconsistencies that don't make logical sense. How does letting Chloe die in the bathroom stop the storm? How does rewinding to change the past solve a problem that was created *by rewinding to change the past*? How does Jefferson still get arrested? There are too many things in the Bay ending that don't add up; the only way I can accept that ending as a possible outcome is if the week has all been a dream.

But thankfully I don't need to accept the Bay ending. Bae over Bay, all day every day.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would probably gooo...

1. Life is Strange (duh)

2. Tales from the Borderlands (so style much funny very wow)

3. The Wolf Among Us (NEEEEEOOOOOONNNNNN)

4. TWD Season 1 (I cried like a baby. But that doesn't necessarily mean it's the best ever.)

5. TWD Season 2 (I enjoyed it, but I have no real love for it. Clem has a cool hat though.)

Life is Strange and TFtB take the top spots for me. Here's (a general reason that applies to both) why: they're both fairly lighthearted. I know Life is Strange often deals with very serious themes, and it takes a dark turn in Episodes 4 and 5, but more often than not it's a very chill, fun, and dreamy game. At least 80% of the time in the first four episodes I had a goofy smile plastered on my face. Life is Strange has actually left me with fond, nostalgic memories. The we have TFtB. TFtB is a goofy, ridiculous, cartoonish game that doesn't take itself too seriously. I have no attachment to TFtB, but I can really appreciate a game like that just tries to be *fun* and get a smile out of you, especially these days. 

But LiS takes my number one spot because of a) its immersive and dreamlike world and b) its incredible duo. I don't need to say much more than that; I already spend all of my time in this sub gushing over how much I love LiS and Max and Chloe. :P

Quickfire: I love The Wolf Among Us for its gorgeous graphic style, genuinely engrossing plot, and character progression. The Walking Dead Season 1 is a very emotional experience that made me question my morality a few times, but I can't say it actually had a lasting impact on me (which is surprising to me; those tears were flowing like Niagra Falls). Season 2 was fun too, but I think I may have been better off without it. Quick aside, I think TFtB is the only Telltale Game that actually benefits from the Telltale formula. The other stories end up suffering as a result of a lack of consequences.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> On your second point: I was actually thinking as well that, if you take the Bay ending as canon, the events of the week could very likely be all a dream. It sounds like a cop out, but by leaving it ambiguous it really isn't. Also I feel like this *is* a context where the "it was all a dream ending" could work. Max left behind Chloe five years ago and never attempted to contact her. We can infer that Max also didn't make any really good friends in Seattle. After having not seen Chloe for five years, Max happens to stumble across her getting murdered in a school bathroom. Apart from plain old shock (she saw someone get murdered for Pete's sake), Max gets hit with a tsunami of guilt. If only she had made some attempt to contact Chloe. I think we can assume that Max wanted to see Chloe again, but she was just too scared to try and call her. Guilt, grief, and, most of all, regret. If only she had done something. What if..? For the whole week, Max is on autopilot. She can't come to terms with what's happened. So in her mind, she imagines what could have been. She saves Chloe. The two immediately become best friends again. They go on an often-nonsensical adventure around the *dreamlike* Arcadia Bay (I think that's the best way to describe Arcadia Bay, and the entire game itself: dreamlike). It's the happiest week of both of their lives. But deep down, Max knows the truth. She knows that none of this is real. The (main) embodiment of the rapidly approaching reality is the storm. The storm can't be stopped. It gets worse and worse the more Max tries to withdraw from reality and live in her perfect dream world. In the end, sacrificing Chloe is the only way for Max to accept the loss of her best friend. Chloe Price is dead and she'll die alone, not having the memories of her last moments with Max Caulfield to comfort her as she disappears into the void. Max mourns Chloe, but finds comfort in the fact that the memories of the week (which she manufactured) will always be real to her, and she will always love *her* Chloe.

...I got really into that. Shit.

**tl;dr:** Max goes into shock following Chloe's death and feels regret for not having tried to contact her best friend. To cope, she dreams a whole week where she and Chloe get to be best friends again.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually started to tear up a little listening to your cover of Obstacles, and not because I thought it was "dreadful" (it wasn't dreadful at all). It was super touching. No matter what obstacles appear in front of you, you can always overcome them with perseverance and a little help from some friends. It's absolutely insane to see the impact this game has had on people.

I wish you all the best in the future buddy! See you around!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm glad you brought attention to the beautiful fact that *Life is Strange could not be made in any other medium*. Being able to rewind and change your choices is as much of a story element as the relationship between Max and Chloe. The story is about discovering yourself and deciding what kind of person you want to be; rewinding is the mechanism through which we can do this. It's not something that could work in a linear medium AT ALL. If Life is Strange had to be made into a movie/book/graphic novel, I actually think they'd have to either remove or completely rework Max's powers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this came up in another thread, but it's possible that Dontnod could bring Max and Chloe back for Season 2 by making the Bae ending canon. And before you start jumping down my throat, let me explain. [EP5 SPOILERTAGTOBESAFE](#s "There are enough posts around here that talk about why the Bay ending is "impossible", or at least why it wouldn't stop the storm, so I don't need to go into detail there. Taking that into account, Max might end up taking the butterfly photo -let's assume she keeps it, they can do a tiny bit of rewriting- and undoing the Bay ending, ultimately ending up in the aftermath of the Bae ending. This could let Dontnod bring back Max and Chloe AND start the second season from the same point, though if you chose Bay you might get an extra 10 or 15 minutes. That said, the people who chose the Bay ending would feel cheated, and I don't know if there's a real story to be told there that's anything more than Pricefield fluff, which I'd love but probably couldn't carry the game in the long run. I wouldn't rule it out though. It would be the easiest way to bring them back and pick up where they left off.") 

Or they could just give us Max and Chloe in an alternate reality. Each season of Life is Strange could be us reliving the same week in drastically different alternate realities, where the one constant is the friendship/love of Max and Chloe. I actually really like that idea. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They ran out of money. With the Bay ending, there was more that they had to show. You can infer everything you need to know from the Bae ending from the little they show you. The Bay ending *had* to be longer, so they dedicated more resources towards it. It's really as simple as that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me, playing the game over the course of the year only enhanced that feeling. It felt like a freaking journey. LiS really became a part of my life; when I wasn't playing a new episode, I was constantly thinking about what would happen next and farting around in this subreddit. Having so much time to reflect really made me connect with the story and characters so much more. If I had played the game in one short burst, I wouldn't have been as invested in the story. Max, Chloe, Kate, and Warren started to become real people in my mind, friends who I couldn't wait to see again. And in the case of Chloe, she became someone that I cared about more than anything.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Having difficulty concentrating" might be the story of everyone in the subreddit right now :P. It's so strange thinking about Life is Strange being over. Done. Capiche! For most of 2015, Life is Strange has been a huge part of my life. I was always thinking about it, daydreaming about it (specifically Pricefield), listening to the soundtrack. Arcadia Bay started to feel like home. And now...it's just gone. While it's left an everlasting imprint on me, it's just so *strange* that there isn't another episode to look forward to, more of Chloe and Max to eagerly await. It's left a gap in my life really. 

Despite it being over, I'm so glad that I've been left with these incredible memories of my last week in Arcadia Bay (*sniff*). I'm also finding comfort in the fact that, no matter what happens in my life next, Max and Chloe will always be forever alive through me and through all of us. They aren't going anywhere anytime soon, or ever.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reading this makes me think that a very possible setup for Season 2, if it happens, is Max letting the storm wreck Arcadia Bay. The new Season would either pick up right after the Bae ending, or begin with Bay Max reconsidering her decision and rewinding back through the photo to save Chloe. I think it would be a bit of a cop out, but I think Dontnod knows how much we love these characters and would throw our money at them the second it gets announced.  </TEXT>

 I think Chloe breaks character by not going haywire about the fact that Max didn't save william.

I thought she would do that as well, but I think we were underestimating her. She probably couldn't stop thinking about that later, but I think she understood that what Max went through was terrible, as well as the fact that Max was trying to make things better for her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The scene in question being when you first see Chloe in Episode 5 after jumping through Warren's photo. I don't know about the rest of you, but Max telling Chloe about the alt-timeline, William, and how Chloe asked her to euthanize her (obviously you could choose not to tell her, but fuck that) was the most emotional scene in the whole game for me. It was bad enough back in July when I was given the choice, but having to say it aloud to Chloe just brought it all back, and that's on top of all the other shit that had happened. I also feel like this scene had some of the best acting in the entire game; I think this was definitely Hannah Telle at her absolute best. I'm a little surprised that this scene is being kind of overlooked. Or was it just not that hard hitting for most of you? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a tough one to answer. All I know is that I was only invested in finding Rachel because of how much she meant to Chloe. I've verbalized too often that Chloe was my only priority, and I didn't want to see her in any more pain. I thought the scene where we found the body was incredibly sad solely because of how much it broke Chloe.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love Chloe. She's got a good heart. She's willing to do anything for Max, as she proves by (determinant) shooting Frank without hesitation to save her. Chloe has a lot of hurt bottled up inside her from everything that's happened to her and, while I can't really relate to the tragic loss of her father, I know a little something about bottling up everything and becoming incredible volatile. Chloe is confident and brash, but that's her armor. She feels like the whole world is against her, which is why she needs her armor. I understand this completely. I also understand what it's like to want your best friend back. 

Also her hair is sooooooooo pretty! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's a bit like the ending to The Last of Us (although you don't make a choice in that game). I think you're supposed to assume that you're choosing between two extremes. The person you care about most dies, or literally everyone else is doomed. That makes the action you take that much more powerful. So if you choose to sacrifice the town, that's saying that Chloe means more to you than the whole world. I think that might be the way this was intended to be looked at as a moral conundrum, but it's very open to interpretation so *whatevs!* </TEXT>

<TITLE> [EP5 SPOILERS] A few things I just need to let out...(rant-ish) </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I played Episode 5 last night, and I've been dealing with the everything that comes with that since then. I don't claim that this post is incredibly original, in fact it's probably old news, but I just needed to compile my thoughts somewhere. This rant began as a comment I was leaving somewhere, but I ended up going a little off topic and decided I should post this by itself. Background: I chose to Sacrifice Arcadia Bay. 

**Wall of text imminent**

Chloe wouldn't leave me, so I sure as hell wouldn't leave her. Around Episode 3 Chloe makes it very clear that Max is the most important thing her world. I fell in love with the character around the same time. I realized that I (well, Max. Not me. Kinda me.) was all she had, and that she was all I cared about. When Episode 3 ended I realized that I had to save and protect Chloe no matter what (and she shows in Episode 4 at Frank's RV that she's willing to do the same for Max), and that's been my only goal since then. All the way through Episode 5 I had to fight to save Chloe. In Jefferson's car, when The Sense of Me was playing, and sitting in the Two Whales I was repeating over and over in my mind *"I can save her"* and *"I will save her"*. When I finally found her, saved her from Jefferson, I told myself that I wouldn't let her be taken away again. The nightmare sequence, particularly when Chloe gets it on with literally everyone else and you have to watch, was torture for me. But I had to push through for Chloe. And I did. Then we came to the final choice. Lose the most important person in the world to you, or let countless innocent people die? Was letting Chloe die in the bathroom really what had to be done to stop the storm? More importantly, would that be worth it? Wouldn't that mean that everything I had done that week (or in real time, this year) was for nothing? Chloe would die alone, bitter, and scared. No one would know what had happened in that imaginary week. Just Max. Just me. It's not just that I can't let her die; I can't let her suffer. Chloe deserves better. She deserves to see her best friend (or perhaps soulmate) again and finally be happy. I've seen some people saying that it's the same as the choice to euthanize Chloe in Episode 4. It's not the same as when she asks you to end her life then. There she gets to pass in the dream. Her final moments are some of the happiest of her life. She gets to spend her last day with her best friend, her angel. She dies with a smile on her face. Wherever the hell(a) she goes after she passes, she won't forget Max. But rewinding to the bathroom? Letting her get shot and killed, bleeding out alone on the cold bathroom floor? Hating everyone and everything, probably thinking of the three greatest loves of her life abandoning her as she slips away? *What kind of world does this?* *Who does this?* How could you expect me/Max to leave my/her best friend to die like *that*? And then live with it? Alone? If you let Arcadia Bay get destroyed, Max and Chloe will still be there for each other. They'll still always have each others back. The death that may have been inadvertently caused by them is a tough pill to swallow, but as long and they have each other they'll be able to make it. They make each other stronger. They complete each other. But if you let Chloe die? Max has to carry all of that weight on her own shoulders. She'll be suffering for every second of the rest of her life. She has to live knowing that she let the person who she loved most, and who loved her more than anything, die in the most awful way imaginable. Max is strong, but do you have any idea how much that would fuck you up? I don't know if I'd be able to recover from a wound like that, let alone bear it. I could *never* let my best friend die. I would do literally anything to save my best friend, whether we're talking about Chloe Price or my best friend in "real" life. I can't *let* them die. If my best friend were to die, I'd want to be able to rewind and save them more than anything. Whether it brings a colossal tornado down upon my city or not, I would do it. That's how much love is worth. It gives you the strength to weather the storm. We may have doomed thousands, but as long as we still have each other we can endure. At the end of the day, that's all you need. It's all you can ask for. A dancing partner. Someone who moves with you, someone who's with you every step of the way, someone who's as committed to you as you are to them. Arcadia Bay may be gone, but Chloe and Max aren't. They're stronger, better people as a result of what they've experienced. Together they can take on the world. If you choose to sacrifice the town, Max and Chloe get the chance to leave together *and to be happy*. The scars might not ever heal, but together they can find something to cover them up with. 

**tl;dr** I have no idea to sum up my thoughts concisely. My mind is a whirlwind and I've broken into tears many times today under the slightest touch. Thank you for reading if you did. Maybe you old geezers can give me ideas how to cope, or at least let me know what your thoughts are? Or, you know, tell me how crazy I am :P </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like that Chloe and Max's relationship never felt like "this is our *gay* couple". It never felt like Dontnod was making an explicit statement or challenge. I've said it before (to calm shippers), and I feel like it perfeclty defines the relationship between Max and Chloe: *love is love.* These two people love each other, so who gives a fuck if they're gay or straight, lovers or best friends? It's a truly beautiful and, as you said, organic relationship.

<TEXT> I don't think it makes you a shitty person. To be quite honest with you, I feel like Max and Chloe are worth more to me than most of the people I know irl too. Maybe it's because they're are always there for me, or because I honestly feel like I know them better than most of my friends, or because I've gone to such lengths to make things better for them. Max and Chloe have had a greater impact on me than most of the people around me. I don't think there's any shame in admitting that. 

That said I would be willing to sacrifice virtually anything for the people close to me, even though I don't feel as connected to most of them as I do to Max and Chloe.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was a phenomenal finale episode. It was very different to the first four episodes of Life is Strange (less color, less quirkiness), but I think it's great in its own right. 

I haven't seen anyone really talking about it (yet; I still have a bunch of posts to go through from the last two weeks), but the scene when you travel through Warren's photo to save Chloe was the most emotional scene for me in the entire game. I told Chloe everything about William and AU-Chloe; when I told her about how she was paralyzed and asked me to euthanize her, I broke. That was the hardest cry I had out of the whole game. It was bad enough having to do it in Episode 4, but having to tell it to Chloe was something else entirely. Kudos to Hannah and Ashly for their ***incredible*** performances that brought that scene to life.

I also gotta admit, when the "previously on Life is Strange" segment began at the very start of the episode I got really choked up. Having a look back at the journey for one last time was really special. The beginning of the end. 

I chose to sacrifice the town so that Chloe could live. I fought the whole time to be with Chloe; I wasn't going to let her go, not for anything. I'm a little sad that I didn't get my Pricefield kiss, but Michel explained it quite well. I like my ending. I haven't watched the "Sacrifice Chloe" ending, and I don't think I will. I could never bring myself to choose that path, and I know that it'll break me if I see it. I saw a tribute that began to play out what happens in the bathroom, and I had to look away. I heard the gunshot though, and I couldn't take it. I could never make that choice. 

It's been a great year in Arcadia Bay with Max and Chloe, and with all of you. I can't thank Dontnod or you guys enough for making this one of the most special experiences of my life. And always remember...


***KICK THE TABLE!***

<TEXT> I have many people in my life who I'd do that for. It's selfish, I know. But selfishness isn't the same thing as evil. I'd trade dozens for my good friends or my parents or my older brother. I need these people. And what kind of friend/son/brother would I be if I let them die?

I've thought about these kind of things before, and I came to the conclusion that you and the people closest to you always have to come first. I honestly don't believe it's possible to help others without helping yourself.  </TEXT>

If you're talking about the beat for beat plot revolving around Jefferson and a missing girl, know that most of that is just surface level; the real story is about characters, relationships, the town, and who you are/Max is as a person. Even the final choice is more about Max as a person and her relationship with Chloe than it is about some storm.

<TEXT> My major takeaway from Life is Strange never was the plot. The storm, Jefferson, Rachel Amber, Kate, that's never what the story was about for me. It was always about Max and Chloe, and the relationship they shared. And in that respect Dontnod delivered. They went above and beyond what I feel we expected from them. I won't remember Life is Strange for the Everyday Heroes contest, or the red binders, or the storm. I'll remember it for getting to wake up in Chloe's room in Episode 3, or getting to watch Blade Runner with my best friend in Episode 4. That's what the journey was for me. It was never about anything or anyone else but Max and Chloe for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I loved the ending actually. I didn't get to play the game for a while, so I saw a few people saying things like that the ending sucked. I didn't believe them anyways. The ending I picked (option B) was the ending I wanted since Episode 3 anyways. Chloe comes first. When the option came up, I didn't hesitate. I would've liked to have on more dialogue tree though... </TEXT>

I expected the ending (I sacrificed the Bay to be clear) to turn me into a sobbing emotional wreck going into the episode. I expected to be in tears knowing that Life is Strange, something that's been a huge part of my life since spring, was over. But I wasn't. I was just...empty, like you said. I was choked up, but emptiness is what I felt more than anything.

I think you're hitting the nail on the head when you talk about how when they were happy, you were happy, and when they were hurt, you were hurt. I've never EVER before experienced a story that was as involving as Life is Strange and allowed me to really become the protagonists like Life is Strange did. There's no doubt that this is a hallmark moment for gaming and, more important to me, a significant life experience. Life is Strange reached through to me, and it changed me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I looked at this a different way. The final choice is Chloe or Everyone in Arcadia Bay. You could say that maybe Joyce and David and plenty of people survived, but I don't think that's the point. Choosing to sacrifice Arcadia Bay is saying that Chloe is worth more to you than countless lives of others. It's a bit like the ending of The Last of Us, which I won't spoil here. In Max's mind there's complete certainty that saving Chloe equals the deaths of the entire population of Arcadia Bay, and that sacrificing her 100% stops the storm and saves everyone from everything that happened that week. </TEXT>

But afterwards, when Telltale began juggling a (baker's!) dozen games at once, they scaled back pretty much everything.

<TEXT>  Pretty much anything by Telltale is almost identical mechanically.

Not really. Sure, there's dialogue trees and point and click interactivity, but LiS has deeper mechanics than Telltale's games. For starters there's a lot more exploration in LiS; TT games are generally more confined, a little more limited. But the big difference mechanically is rewinding. Rewinding is a HUGE part of LiS's gameplay (and narrative). It's the core of the whole game (both in terms of gameplay and narrative (ludo-narrative resonance, yay!)) I think that LiS has more engaging gameplay as a result (that bit's my opinion, but there's no denying that rewinding adds a whole new layer to the gameplay).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be honest with you, a 6/10 or 7/10 is a pretty respectable score. I don't mind seeing a reviewer give LiS that score; not only is it justifiable, but he or she is entitled to his/her opinion. What I do mind is when the review is absolute nonsense ("utter tripe" as a friend of mine would say). The IGN reviews of Life is Strange are pretty awful. I don't hate Mitch Dyer (IGN) because he doesn't like the same game I do; his reviews of the episodes are just complete nonsense. His Episode 4 review literally criticizes the game *for the reviewer being dumb* (literally, go read the bit on the evidence puzzle). The same goes for other outlets. Polygon has generally been a site that I take issue with, because I feel that a lot of their reviews are written purely to stir controversy; most of the controversial reviews of theirs that I've read present opinions with poor justification, which leads me to think that they were written for clicks. 

tl;dr Everyone's entitled to their own opinion, and I respect that. I just feel that the quality of journalism/criticism that we see a lot in the games media (and movie) industry is pretty poor. Big sites like IGN, Polygon, etc seem like they are merely pushing clicks (and pushing sales when it comes to huge releases). 

(P.S. Thank you for having the guts to say that LiS doesn't have the best plot in this sub. The world is amazing, the characters are phenomenal, but the moment to moment *plot* is actually nothing special. That doesn't necessarily make the overall narrative worse; The Last of Us has a great story as well, but it has very little to do with the actual plot as much as it does the world and the characters.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've got a slightly different take on this. LiS seems to be something along the lines of a cult hit; it's got an incredibly loyal fanbase that believes it's one of the greatest games ever made, but it got pretty lukewarm reception from critics. Something that we can *all* agree on though is that Life is Strange is super weird. Some people are completely turned off by the weirdness (particularly in the dialogue) and some of us adore it. The only other game I know that matches this description is **Deadly Premonition**. That game was too weird for me, but who knows, you might like it. 

Then of course I've got a more normal answer. **The Last of Us** is a great game that revolves around the strong relationship between its two protagonists, Joel and Ellie. Joel and Ellie are right up there with Max and Chloe as one of the best video game duos ever. 

EDIT: For clarification, I don't give a flying fuck about critical reception. I was just drawing a parallel between LiS and Deadly Premonition.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-11-01 01:20:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was curious about the kind of vibes we all got from this game. It's a dark and violent story about the end of our days, but there's a lot of hope and light (*"look for the light"*) in it as well. For every death, tragedy, and brutal murder, there's a heartfelt conversation with Ellie or a beautiful vista to look out at. As opposed to something like The Road, Children of Men, or The Walking Dead, there's a lot of life and vibrance to The Last of Us. I personally found there to be more and greater uplifting moments than brutally tragic ones, but I'm also batshit crazy. 

So I was honestly wondering, was your takeaway of the game more positive or negative? Did it leave you fulfilled or depressed? Spoiler tagged so that we can discuss particular examples and moments.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've found myself in a bit of a conundrum involving the release of Episode 5 and another important event on my calendar.

Okay, so we all know that Episode 5: Polarized will roll out on October 20th worldwide. There's a really cool counter in the subreddit banner with awesome art reminding us of how close the release day is. We're all super excited for the 20th in one way or another. On the day and the following days we're all going to be here in /r/lifeisstrange crying together or jumping-for-joy together, depending on how evil those Dontnod fellows are. 

But I've got a bit of a dilemma. I can't wait for Episode 5. I really want to jump on it ASAP, and then get involved with the community and be on the ground floor when we're all coming together and reacting to the finale. *But*, about two weeks after Episode 5 releases (towards the end of the first week of November) I've got a rather important, let's say, event coming up. It's the kind of thing that will need to have my full attention, my complete focus. And I know that, no matter what happens in Episode 5, I'm not going to be able to think about anything BUT Life is Strange for a long while afterwards; I won't be able to keep my eye on the ball and give this other thing my undivided attention. 

So my dilemma (sorry for the semi-long-windedness and weirdness) is whether or not I should put off playing Episode 5 *for more than two weeks*, *giving up getting to experience the conclusion to this life-changing story (to me, personally) with everyone else here in the LiS community*, in favor of having a clearer mind and therefore better performance in this other important thing. First World Problems, I know, but this is actually something that really matters to me. This is a decision that ultimately I will have to make myself, but I wanted to just hear some advice from you guys and gals, if you have any, on what *you* think I should do. Or rather if you were in my position, "What would you do now?" 

Even if this proves fruitless (which I'm sure won't happen, I have a lot of faith in this sub), typing this out is helping me process this whole situation. Clock's ticking. Thank you for reading this far down.

EDIT: I wasn't very clear about this, but time is not the issue. The issue is that the finale is going to completely fuck with my head and occupy every nook and cranny of my cranium at a time when I need to have a clear head.    </TEXT>

<TITLE> If WB Montreal makes a sequel to Arkham Origins, should Kevin Conroy play the role of Batman? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-25 00:20:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was thinking about this the other day and wanted to hear some of you guys' opinions. Kevin Conroy most likely wasn't in Arkham Origins because he was already working on Arkham Knight (let that slip), so Roger Craig Smith got the role of Batman. General consensus seems to be that RCS did an excellent job as the Dark Knight. Should he continue to play Batman in WB Montreal's games, or would it be best if Conroy took over?

Personally I think Roger Craig Smith should play Batman in any further installments. Kevin Conroy is my Batman, but I feel that he shouldn't feature in any further Arkham titles (at least not as Batman). I'm not too sure why I feel this way, but I do.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you didn't hold him back against Nathan, Warren's knuckles should be broken. When you look at the way he repeatedly punches Nathan with his bare fist, there's no way he wouldn't have broken them. Punching someone in the face won't just damage them, it'll damage your hand. Fun fact, gloves weren't introduced in Boxing to protect your face; they were introduced to prevent hand and knuckle injuries. 

I know this is completely insignificant and totally nitpicky, but it has been bugging me recently (provided the amount of times I've watched that scene over and over). Thought I'd throw it out there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When Episode 5 is out and Max and Chloe's story is all said and done I'd really like some kind of Collector's Edition, or just a physical copy, of the game. It's been one hell of a journey, and I want a hard copy of the game to keep for the future and to remember the game by. (And in case PSN implodes.)(And because of Collector's Edition *swag*.) What about you guys? Anyone else want this too? 

Also, what kind of other stuff would you like to see in a hypothetical Collector's Edition? I think a poster or two, a statuette, a cool box, and maybe some polaroids from the game would be cool. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [EP4 SPOILERS] About that ending... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-31 13:18:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I thought this episode was phenomenal all the way through. I freaking loved it. But then there's that ending. The ending was hella fucked up and creepy, and Jefferson FUCKING KILLED CHLOE, but didn't we kinda see that all coming? Since Episode 1 a lot of us have been convinced that Jefferson was the evil binder-man, and before this episode a lot of us were saying that it would probably end with Max getting drugged and taken to the Dark Room. And yeah it was crazy when they FUCKING KILLED CHLOE, but it also felt to me like a fake out after the whole alt universe Chloe thing. I didn't believe for a second that Chloe was gone for good. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I didn't feel the same emotional punch in face with the ending of this episode that I did in the last episode. Especially since the ending of Ep4 was out of our control; the ending of Ep3 was actually a direct result of something we did. But it seems like I might be alone on this (?). 

P.S. Did anyone else think the episode was going to end with Nathan shooting up the Vortex Club party? It made sense in my head, considering the subject matter this game has dealt with already. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Specifically what I am referring to is the conclusion to Jason/Arkham Knight's story. He just drops the whole "I hate Batman" thing and literally gets up and leaves. Then he turns up for the finale in one shot, and you don't see anything else of him. He doesn't even get a single line of dialogue there! They don't explain what's going on, why Jason is suddenly back on Batman's side, and what happens to him following the capture of Scarecrow. There is no closure to his story. 

(I haven't yet achieved the final ending, so if his story is given a proper conclusion following this please let me know and excuse my ignorance) </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Arkham Knight: My Theory](/spoiler) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-29 01:17:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is my theory as to who the Arkham Knight is. Arkham City spoilers within. 

The guys at Rocksteady have said again and again that the Arkham Knight is an original character; I believe them 100%. My theory begins with the death of the Joker at the end of Arkham City. There is (obviously) some speculation that the Joker is actually alive and that he's going to come back in Arkham Knight, but that's not true. In the Arkhamverse, Joker is dead. The clever kids at Rocksteady know that it would be cheap and stupid to bring him back having previously killed him off in such dramatic fashion. But with him being the main antagonist in both Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, Rocksteady can't leave him out entirely. We already know Harley Quinn has a presence in the game, but I don't think that'll be it for Mista J's legacy. 

In the Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC for Arkham City, there were several signs and posters for Cadmus Labs throughout the Steel Mill. Cadmus Labs has a history in DC comics lore for creating all kinds of wacky science projects and most notably created a clone of Superman, Superboy. This led to many fans speculating that Cadmus would create a clone of the Joker for Arkham 3, effectively reincarnating the Joker. Once again, that's not going to happen. Not only would this feel cheap (Sefton Hill is a smart guy), but it also wouldn't have much impact as it wouldn't actually be the real Joker; the clone wouldn't have his brain. Yet Cadmus Labs still plays into my theory.

The most notorious Easter Egg from Arkham City is Harley's pregnancy test. This (accompanied by her chilling voice over from the credits) suggested that the sequel to Arkham City would involve Harley and the Joker's child taking revenge on Batman (or at least it'd involve the damn kid, I don't know). This seemed solid. For a few months everyone believed it. Then Harley Quinn's Revenge turned this plot around completely. In the Steel Mill there was a stack of pregnancy tests, all negative, next to Scarface painted like the Joker in a crib. This completely debunked the Harley/Joker kid theory that we had all gotten behind. But something that you may have overlooked is the number of negative pregnancy tests. Obviously it was a lot, as to clearly and openly say to you "NOPE", but there's more to it than that. You can deduce by the sheer number of pregnancy tests that Harley took that she was desperately hoping for Joker's child; she had everything hinged on that hope, and it drove her further into insanity. Point is, she really wanted that kid. 

It may seem like I've been ranting for a while, but here's where this theory begins to take form. Cadmus Labs will not clone the Joker, and Harley is not going to give birth to Joker Jr. What I believe is going to happen is somewhere in between. Cadmus Labs will, using Joker's DNA, create the 'son' of the Joker in a laboratory. It's possible that Harley will somehow get them to do this. His aging will be accelerated, and he will be made into the perfect physical specimen, a living weapon. But with the Joker having been his 'father', he'll have reason to hate Batman and seek vengeance (or at least Cadmus could program it into him). Cadmus, with their virtually limitless resources, will be where he got his private army from. This 'son' of the Joker is the Arkham Knight. 

A slightly more offhand part to this theory is that the Arkham Knight was made from DNA from both Joker and Batman. This would explain his resemblance to the Dark Knight in costume.

The Arkham Knight will be the ultimate anti-Batman. His 'parent' was 'killed' by Batman, and his life goal is to get vengeance on Joker's killer. He is not the Knight of Gotham, but the Knight of Arkham. What I'm getting at here is similar to the story of Batman's rogue Prometheus. In both appearance and MO he will be the antithesis of Batman. Batman works alone, Arkham Knight has an army. Batman doesn't kill, Arkham Knight does. So on and so forth. 

In short, the Arkham Knight will be the Joker's 'son', created by Cadmus Labs as the ultimate killer and physical specimen, and dedicated to the destruction of the Dark Knight. 

That's my theory. Maybe you've heard it before, maybe not, but I felt like pitching in. And I am pretty confident in this theory. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and please let me know what you think about this theory. Thank you. </TEXT>
