<TEXT> My point was that a lot of important change actually takes place outside of elections. A true challenge to Trump will come from people organizing together to exert pressure on all parts of the political   economic system, not just the vote.

Gandhi, the person everyone associates "be the change" with, was after all a protester who proved civil disobedience could win the independence of a whole county, no elections required.

The same goes for Nelson Mandela in South Africa, and Martin Luther King Jr. in America. Their lives were proof of what could be accomplished in spite of elections, not through them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Not sure why it's a pity. You serve the country and in return get citizenship that you earned. I mean, it definitely should be easier to gain it through other means but I have no disregard for anyone who wants to serve a country they're tying to get citizenship to.

Most Americans don't earn their citizenship, they just get born. That alone shows how arbitrary so much moralizing over citizenship is. The forgotten fact is this country was founded in the first place on the basis of *human* rights: "We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights" - but I *never* said people shouldn't pursue whatever opportunities they have in front of them.

 As far as higher education, it's more of a fault with the bureaucratic nature of applying for and receiving grants, scholarships, etc. This is a lot more of a fault with the governments stance on education and the schools who charge ridiculous amounts of money to attend.


I never blamed the military for any of this. These are just the conditions that help make military service so appealing, and why high school is a better time to recruit vs. in college. Economic location matters, too. My well-to-do suburban high school had zero recruitment presence. The overwhelmingly immigrant urban high school I taught at had a whole calendar full of events from every branch.

 I came from a low to middle class family and joined just to join and serve. I've been in for over 10 years and have yet to use TA or my GI Bill for college because I instead have worked to starting a small business. The military definitely taught me the responsibility and character in order to take those steps where I never would have if I didn't join.

"When the contemporary man steps from the street, of clamorous insincere advertisement, push, adulteration, underselling and intermittent employment into the barrack-yard, he steps on to a higher social plane, into an atmosphere of service and cooperation and of infinitely more honorable emulations. Here at least men are not flung out of employment to degenerate because there is no immediate work for them to do. They are fed a drilled and training for better services. Here at least a man is supposed to win promotion by self-forgetfulness and not by self-seeking." </TEXT>

<TEXT> The rationale for invading Afghanistan was that the Taliban government sheltered Al-Qaeda, who carried out the 9/11 attacks under the direction of Osama bin Laden. But the Taliban were only in power there because the U.S. government spent billions of dollars arming religious radicals (i.e. mujahideen) to overthrow the secular Afghan government in the 1980s. [That's called blowback.](https://www.thenation.com/article/blowback/) And then it took even more money and a whole decade to actually get Bin Laden, who was actually hiding in Pakistan. And we're still in Afghanistan today, even though we also overthrew the Taliban. None of it had to do with being "free". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sex work wouldn't be generally coercive if it weren't generally criminalized by law and stigmatized by culture. If you take out the criminal element, most sex workers are self-employed, work on their own terms, choose their own clients, and want the same protections desired by all workers. Under socialism, there will be sex workers as sure as there will be doctors, teachers, musicians, and actors (none of which can be replaced by automation). </TEXT>

<TEXT> There will be no for-profit private employers in socialism, but there will still be workers and professionals, as well as rewards and compensation (i.e. personal appropriations of common property). Socialism is against private property, not personal property or being personally compensated for collective labor. 

 We by no means intend to abolish this personal appropriation of the products of labour, an appropriation that is made for the maintenance and reproduction of human life, and that leaves no surplus wherewith to command the labour of others. All that we want to do away with is the miserable character of this appropriation, under which the labourer lives merely to increase capital, and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of the ruling class requires it.

...

 When, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into the property of all members of society, personal property is not thereby transformed into social property. It is only the social character of the property that is changed. It loses its class character.

...

i.e. There will still be specialized labor under socialism - artisans, builders, doctors, teachers, sex workers, engineers, etc. They just won't be exploited for the purpose of private capital and its accumulation. 

But the real problem is there is *always* an undercurrent to this question, every time it's asked, and that is, "is there something inherently wrong with sex work in particular which socialism must abolish?" And the answer is no, there is nothing wrong with sex work any more than there is with nursing or therapy or teaching or acting.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Doubtful. The Rio Grande Valley is a diverse community and one of the Texas Democratic Party's few strongholds. The people who actually live on the border overwhelmingly rejected the border fence, and now the border wall.

To them, fortification of the border is nothing but a political football used by outsiders (i.e. the Feds, most Republicans) who have no idea how ineffectual physical barriers are for "security", and who also don't have to deal with the harmful consequences of living with them. 

  "I probably have one more decade to live, and I had one decade of torture," said Tamez, 82. "I think if they start that business again, I don't know how much fight I'll have left in me, but I'm going to fight it until the end."

They're not the authors of the quote or even related to the author. They've also quoted [Ralph Waldo Emerson](http://i.imgur.com/jCaPtKq.jpg), [Matt Damon](http://i.imgur.com/91dCaCs.jpg), and [Isaac Newton](http://i.imgur.com/ECysIJX.jpg).

<TEXT> Under the new law, all felony charges against juveniles will begin in a newly-established Youth Part of the criminal court system, presided over by a family court judge where offenders will have access to additional intervention services and programming. 

Any violent felony charge that fails a three part test will be automatically referred to family court. 

When detention is necessary, juveniles will no longer be held in adult county jails but youth detention facilities regulated by the state office for children and family services. 

If a juvenile is convicted in the Youth Part of the criminal court system and sentenced to state prison, they will instead be incarcerated in an adolescent offender facility separate from adults. 

All non-violent felony charges and misdemeanor charges will be automatically referred to family court, unless the district attorney demonstrates extraordinary circumstances that justify retaining them in the Youth Part of the criminal court system.

<TEXT>  How did that work out?

Once in power, the communists embarked upon a program of rapid modernization centered on separation of church and state, eradication of illiteracy (which at the time stood at 90%), land reform, emancipation of women, and abolition of feudal practices.

Traditional practices that were deemed feudal - such as usury, bride price and forced marriage - were banned, and the minimum age of marriage was raised. Education was encouraged for both genders and it became normal for women in the cities to wear whatever they wanted and for men to go clean shaven.

These new reforms were not well received by the majority of the Afghan population, particularly in rural areas, who saw them as un-Islamic and as a forced approach to Western culture in Afghan society. Several rebel groups declared a Jihad against the new government. 

The US took advantage of that and funneled billions of dollars to Jihadi rebel groups via the CIA's Operation Cyclone. The USSR also intervened but ultimately retreated, and in 1991, the USSR collapsed. In 1992, the Afghan government was replaced with an Islamic state. Jihadi groups then fought each other until the Taliban took over in 1996.

Saying that you don't like something doesn't mean anything unless you're organized - and historically, the left has been better organized (out of necessity). 

Also, your complaints about absentee fathers and "internal" problems are badly dated, from a time when people didn't acknowledge that the economy is the basis of social relations. That's why black activists call for practical solutions like jobs and housing and criminal justice reform, not useless guilt tripping.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> *The Masses* was a short-lived American socialist magazine that existed from 1911 to 1917, when it was shut down by the U.S. government. This cartoon comes from the January 1915 edition, and refers to the ongoing developments in imperial Russia (later to become a full-blown revolution) as well as in WWI. 

Six months earlier, Germany had declared war on Russia on July 19th 1914 - a largely anticipated event. But barely a week before that, the Russian capital of St. Petersburg had already been under siege by its own workers, in a widely-covered massive and violent general strike. St. Petersburg was in anarchy from July 3rd to July 10th, as workers flooded the streets, clashed with police, and destroyed public property. 

Not until the 17th - two days before war - was the city back in order, and in the wake of the strike, several left-wing publications were shut down, sympathetic members of government were exiled to Siberia, and tensions remained high between the people and the government.

<TEXT> Who or what is that "disrespectful" towards? Dick Cheney?

One of the first things the new Iraqi regime did was privatize the oil fields which had been nationalized under Saddam and open them up to foreign investment. Saying "we went in for the oil" does not mean "we" the American people went in to get lower gas prices. It was about private ownership of oil reserves which had until the war and regime change been inaccessible. 

 Oil remains fundamentally a government business. While many regions of the world offer great oil opportunities, the Middle East with two-thirds of the worlds oil and the lowest cost, is still where the prize ultimately lies, even though companies are anxious for greater access there, progress continues to be slow.

Dick Cheney, 1999

 Link to Syrian Obersavatory for Human rights statements about casualties please.

 Cause according to my Google search it's state run media and Syrian officials who are putting out that information: https://www.wsj.com/articles/syrian-media-say-u-s-attack-caused-damage-to-air-base-multiple-casualties-1491535071

 Looking into your post history you even posted an artlcle on this sub that states that the information came from the Syrian army here: http://www.france24.com/en/20170407-usa-strikes-syria-base-with-cruise-missiles-trump-gas-attack

 So why the are stating to me that it came from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights when you know in fact that it didn't?


You know if you had *any* sincerity about gathering information at all you would've asked a simple question to my comment but instead you decided to launch an investigative tirade and order me to produce evidence for you. That's fine, just don't expect me to respect you for it.

And don't lecture me on defensive when you put *seven* obnoxious question marks in your last comment.  </TEXT>

Trump is playing with volatile fire, and I doubt the people who say this is all controlled.  </TEXT>

It is frequently quoted by major Western news media, such as Voice of America, Reuters, BBC, CNN and National Public Radio, since the beginning of the uprising about daily numbers of deaths from all sides in the conflict and civilians killed in airstrikes in Syria. SOHR has been described as being "pro-opposition" and anti-Assad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Blaming Hamas goes hand in hand with exonerating the IDF's civilian kills. It's completely explicit. From the IDF, regarding the bombing of UN shelters in 2014:

 Hamas chooses where these battles are conducted and, despite Israels best efforts to prevent civilian casualties, **Hamas is ultimately responsible for the tragic loss of civilian life**. Specifically in the case of UN facilities, it is important to note the repeated abuse of UN facilities by Hamas, namely with at least three cases of munitions storage within such facilities.

Therefore, you can't blame IDF if we bomb UN schools and hospitals from an altitude of 5,000 feet - Hamas made us do it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's anti-capitalist, drawn by Robert Minor in the July 1916 issue of *The Masses*. *The Masses* was a short-lived revolutionary socialist magazine published in the U.S. from 1911 until 1917, when it was shut down along with hundreds of other left wing publications under the 1917 Espionage Act, for opposing WWI. 

The attitude of all the left at the time was that WWI was an inter-imperialist war and a total waste of human life -- "when the rich wage war, it's the poor who die." Considering WWI was started by three quarreling royal cousins, they were pretty right.

 *Strike against war, for without you no battles can be fought. Strike against manufacturing shrapnel and gas bombs and all other tools of murder. Strike against preparedness that means death and misery to millions of human beings. Be not dumb, obedient slaves in an army of destruction. Be heroes in an army of construction.*

<TEXT>  New amendments to the bill added last Thursday would allow sheriffs deputies to report the release dates of serious and violent felons to ICE. The changes also clarified the language of the bill to allow state and local law enforcement agencies to participate in task forces, even when immigration enforcement becomes an element of the investigation.

 And under the amended bill, law enforcement officers would be able to notify ICE if they come into contact with a person who previously has been deported and has a violent felony record.

Sort of ironic you complain about "simplistic labels" while ignoring large parts of the "bullshit bill" - a pretty shallow analysis.  </TEXT>

...

 In the past, the Syracuse clearinghouse had received information from ICE about individuals' arrests, detainment locations, detainment dates and deportation dates, should an immigrant be deported, Long said. The agency also previously released criminal histories, including charges, convictions, sentences and corresponding dates.

...

 Now, the group only receives information as to the nationality, gender and citizenship of a given immigrant, as well as the date a detainer was prepared, the law enforcement agency it was issued to and local body's response. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Fake news can be effective. A poll released earlier this week found that 74 percent of Republicans now believe Trumps evidence-free claim that his Trump Tower office were wiretapped, or under government surveillance during the 2016 presidential campaign. **When House Intelligence Committee chair and former Trump transition official Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) made a clumsy attempt to validate Trumps claim last week, the story was quickly amplified by Sputnik and RT.**

The circle jerk of treason.

<TEXT> Nunes is chair of the House intelligence committee, which is investigating the Russian involvement in the election. Trump has already cried wolf on himself being the victim of illegal surveillance, by tweeting Obama spied on him. That didn't work. So now he's going through Nunes, who can give the cry a little more credibility (or at least ambiguity) by *seeming* as somehow the result of the investigation.

It's very important for Trump to look like the victim of illegal surveillance, because the truth is he was being surveilled by U.S. counter-espionage forces for communicating with foreign spies. </TEXT>

 "For too many years, for too long, leaders of Western democracies have been just ignoring and moving on from what Mr. Putin has been doing," Kara-Murza said.

 He said there are currently 100 political prisoners in Russia and, after tens of thousands of people marched through the streets in different cities across Russia over the weekend, more than 1,500 people were arrested.

 Kara-Murza said he thinks the U.S. should be honest about whats happening in Russia and not "enable corrupt or abusive behavior" and "continue to engage with Russias civil society."

 He said he believes Western democracies have given Putin a pass to interfere in elections because they "have not taken a principled, firm stand against Russia's actions."

<TEXT> The U.S. is currently looking down the barrel of the largest nursing shortage since the implementation of Medicare in the 1960s. It's projected the U.S. will need a workforce of over 4.2 million registered nurses (RNs) by 2022, due largely to the aging Baby Boomer population. 

But the nurse labor market isn't growing fast enough, and less educational spending plus fewer work visas aren't helping. If current trends continue, then there will be a shortfall of 260,000 unfilled nursing positions by 2025. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Paypal**

A state Commerce Department analysis shows officials expected a planned Charlotte PayPal operations center to contribute more than $200 million annually to the state's gross domestic product  an overall measure of the economy. By the end of 2028, the state expected PayPal to have added more than $2.66 billion overall to the state economy, according to the March 2, 2016, analysis.

But shortly after House Bill 2 was enacted, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman announced the company was backing out of the 400-job plan because of the law.

***

**Deutsche Bank**

Using the same model, the Commerce Department estimated that a Deutsche Bank project in Cary would pump about $47 million annually into the economy once fully staffed at 250 jobs in 2017. The September 2015 analysis predicted a total impact of about $543 million by the end of 2027. But the company announced it was halting plans because of the law.

***

**CoStar**

The AP used figures from North Carolina and Virginia to conclude that CoStar's decision not to put its facility in Charlotte will cost North Carolina at least $250 million.

CoStar's CEO had recommended Charlotte to his board and was preparing for final negotiations for a site there when the board backed out because of negative publicity over the law, according to a September 2016 email exchange between Charlotte Chamber of Commerce and city officials.

***

**Voxpro**

The AP analysis valued Voxpro's decision not to come to the state at about $52 million based on figures from North Carolina and an interview with the CEO.

The company was in negotiations to bring hundreds of call-center jobs to the Raleigh area, but chose not to because of the law, founder and CEO Dan Kiely said in an interview. The company chose Athens, Georgia; Kiely said the company will employ 500 there.

***

**Adidas**

The AP used figures from North Carolina and Georgia to compute a value of about $67 million for the decision by Adidas not to choose North Carolina for a factory.

The shoe and apparel company was considering a High Point site and visited about a week before the law passed, according to state economic development emails. 

***

**Sports events, concerts, conventions**

The AP conducted more than a dozen interviews and email exchanges with tourism officials and planners to determine the state lost more than $196 million from sporting events, conventions, concerts and other events. Cities researched include: Asheville, Charlotte, Greensboro, Raleigh, Manteo, Wilmington, Durham and Fayetteville. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  They misinformed us, and told us Quanice was shot three times in the chest. We later found out through the death certificate that, that wasnt true," she said. Quanice was on his knees when he was shot in the head and in the chest. I think thats important when anybody wants to say that he was this dangerous robber.

 Hayes said her son is the victim in the case and that he was painted by police as a robber or a car prowler.

 All of which is not a reason to be executed in the United States of America or the state of Oregon, Hayes said.

...

 Police spokesman Sgt. Pete Simpson told The Oregonian/OregonLive on Wednesday that he didn't know the total number of officers at the shooting scene, but confirmed the presence of one K9 officer and one officer with less-than-lethal ammunition in addition to Hearst.

...

 Unlike the "petit" jury, which is used to determine guilt in a trial, a grand jury consists of 16 to 23 jurors who are not screened for bias. The purpose of the grand jury is not to determine guilt or innocence, but to decide whether there is probable cause to prosecute someone for a felony crime. The grand jury operates in secrecy and the normal rules of evidence do not apply. The prosecutor runs the proceedings and no judge is present. Defense lawyers are not allowed to be present in the grand jury room and cannot present evidence, but may be available outside the room to consult with witnesses. The prosecutor and the grand jury members may not reveal what occurred in the grand jury room and witnesses cannot obtain a transcript of their testimony. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Have you perhaps considered the vast economical and social (no to mention cultural) differences between single European countries and the entirety of the USA?

The differences in social and economic terms aren't that large between most of America and Europe. You could travel between the US and Europe and find us all dealing with fairly similar problems economically (unemployment, urban poverty, immigration, automation, austerity, etc) under almost identical conditions of general social stability (compared to say, Honduras), and even media consumption habits (look at our internet penetration). 

America is much more different *legally* and politically [compared to the countries of Europe,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_legal_systems#) and is one of only three in the world to guarantee an explicit right to bear arms (Mexico and Guatemala being other two - notoriously safe in gun violence). And among fellow descendants of the Britsh Empire, we definitely have the loosest and least consistent set of gun laws. </TEXT>

You're right the media should treat all victims of massacres equally, but they won't, because not all news is equally profitable. And in the end, the media can only point out the problems that politics has to solve.

The worst kind of politicizing though is the gossiping kind - it doesn't seem outwardly political, but fixating on the character of victims or perpetrators of violence doesn't stop a flawed system from producing more of them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unsurprisingly, the anti-immigrant "citizen" knows next to nothing about the legal system.

It takes several layers of *approval from Homeland Security* to move forward with your citizenship application, not the waiting of x amount of years. 

There are several categories of citizen applicants, and a quota system is used to determine who can continue. That has nothing to do with years of residence. 

Amongst men without professional degrees married to US citizens with American children, there were about *800 approvals* granted last year, out of 200,000+ in the same category waiting.

There are shorter lines for the wealthy and higher educated, because American values, with a total of more than 4.4 million people waiting in "line" to take the oath of allegiance. </TEXT>

That sounds like justification to me. And it was ICE policy under Bush and Obama not to target non-criminal immigrants, because theoretically the agency has more important things to do than go after peaceful people and their own political vendettas.

ICE didn't carry out these raids because they served any practical purpose. They had a political grudge against a local government and used that to decide how to "enforce" the law.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Is it advisable for one who is not an expert on economic and social issues to express views on the subject of socialism? I believe for a number of reasons that it is.

It might appear that there are no essential methodological differences between astronomy and economics: scientists in both fields attempt to discover laws of general acceptability for a circumscribed group of phenomena in order to make the interconnection of these phenomena as clearly understandable as possible. But in reality such methodological differences do exist. 

 The discovery of general laws in the field of economics is made difficult by the circumstance that observed economic phenomena are often affected by many factors which are very hard to evaluate separately. In addition, the experience which has accumulated since the beginning of the so-called civilized period of human history hasas is well knownbeen largely influenced and limited by causes which are by no means exclusively economic in nature. For example, most of the major states of history owed their existence to conquest. The conquering peoples established themselves, legally and economically, as the privileged class of the conquered country.

 But historic tradition is, so to speak, of yesterday; nowhere have we really overcome what Thorstein Veblen called the predatory phase of human development. The observable economic facts belong to that phase and even such laws as we can derive from them are not applicable to other phases. Since the real purpose of socialism is precisely to overcome and advance beyond the predatory phase of human development, economic science in its present state can throw little light on the socialist society of the future.

<TEXT> Ignoring sexuality is basically erasing LGBT people from your survey... how are you supposed to a) acknowledge their existence as people and b) design policies that identify and address particular needs of the LGBT senior population (like aging with HIV/AIDS), if you don't have any indicator of where they are or how they're doing? 

That's why the government needs to include sexuality in demographic surveys. There's no way to functionally serve the LGBT population if you don't have sexuality included in demographic data. You can't just ignore people's sexual orientation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.

 This world in arms is not spending money alone.

 It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.

 The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities.

 It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population.

 It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals.

 It is some 50 miles of concrete highway.

 We pay for a single fighter with a half million bushels of wheat.

 We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people.

 This, I repeat, is the best way of life to be found on the road the world has been taking.

 This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.

I'm pretty sure the reasoning of these statements stand well enough on their own. Speeches can and usually do make several points, as any decent argument would. It's not just one continuous stream of thought to be bought whole or not at all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [**"The Struggle in the Fields"** (1996)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIHCdjpFPrw) is an episode from the PBS documentary series *Chicano!* that covers the rise of the United Farm Workers, led by Cesar Chavez.

[**"The Fight in the Fields"** (1996)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgMkX4eE3bs t=8s) is an independently-produced documentary about pretty much the same thing.

The UFW was formed as a merger between Mexican and Filipino workers after Filipino farm workers organzed under the AFL-CIO affiliated Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) went on a wildcat strike against grape growers in Delano, California demanding wages equal to the federal minimum.

They were then joined by Cesar Chavez's predominantly Mexican-American National Farm Workers Association, who issued this statement six weeks into the strike:

 **WE SHALL OVERCOME**

 **September 16th, 1965**



 In a 400 square mile area halfway between Selma and Weedpatch, California, a general strike of farm workers has been going on for six weeks. The Filipinos, under AWOC AFL-CIO began the strike for a $1.40 per hour guarantee and a union contract. They were joined by the independent Farm Workers Association which as a membership of several thousand Mexican-Americans. 

 Filipino, Mexican-American and Puerto Rican workers have been manning picket lines daily for 41 days in a totally non-violent manner. Ranchers in the area, which include DiGiorgio Fruit, Schenley, and many independent growers, did not take the strike seriously at first. By the second or third week, however, they began taking another look  and striking back. Mechanized agriculture began picketing the pickets  spraying them with sulfur, running tractors by them to create dust storms, building barricades of farm machinery so that scabs could not see the pickets. These actions not only increased the determination of the strikers, but convinced some of the scabs that the ranchers were, in fact, less than human. Scabs quit work and the strike grew. 

 The growers hired security guards for $43 a day. They began driving their Thunderbirds, equipped with police dogs and rifles, up and down the roads. The people made more picket signs, drew in their belts, and kept marching. 

 Production was down 30% and the growers began looking for more and more scabs. They went to Fresno and Bakersfield and Los Angeles to find them. They didn't tell the workers that they would be scab crews. The pickets followed them into every town and formed ad hoc strike committees to prevent scabbing. They succeeded in these towns. Within two weeks, only one bus, with half a dozen winos, escorted by a pearl gray Cadillac, drove into the strike zone. A new plan was formed. The ranchers would advertise in South Texas and old Mexico. They bring these workers in buses and the workers are held in debt to the rancher before they even arrive in town. We have a new and more difficult task ahead of us with these scabs. 

 As our strike has grown, workers have matured and now know why and how to fight for their rights. As the strike has grown into a movement for justice by the lowest paid workers in America, friends of farm workers have begun to rally in support of 'LA CAUSA'. Civil rights, church, student and union groups help with food and money. 

 We believe that this is the beginning of a significant drive to achieve equal rights for agricultural workers. In order to enlist your full support and to explain our work to you, I would like to bring some of our pickets and meet with you. 



 *VIVA LA CAUSA Y*

 *VIVA LA HUELGA* 



 Cesar Estrada Chavez

 General Director,

 National Farm Workers Association

Being a peaceful resident should not be punished...pretty simple. Calling someone an illegal alien doesn't erase their inalienable rights, and the Constitution forbids cruel and unusual punishment, disproportionate and detached from the crime. Is that supposed to be controversial now? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Many of them have children who are citizens, almost all of them play an important role in the communities they are staying in. It sucks, but immigration policy should have been enforced properly for the last two decades; the mistake was in letting them think they could put down roots without legal authorization to do so.

This is like saying, "yes deporting these people is cruel to children and value-wise pointless, but you know we made that choice and should really commit to it."

 There are about five million Mexicans who have no right whatsoever to be here. The United States has the right to kick them out.

It really doesn't, it is wrong to be cruel.  </TEXT>

Certainly better than the experience of thousands who wait 20+ years for their legality - that are usually the refugee immigrants and manual-labor migrants, rather than the preferred highly skilled professionals who can get legality with a sponsorship from their employer (such an important quality of citizenship).

<TEXT> Drug traffickers in Mexico literally cut people's heads off and leave them on the footsteps of elementary schools as part of their turf wars over who can control smuggling across the border. 

The majority of these cartels get their products through bloodshed in Central America - including humans, fleeing the ironically U.S.-manufactured political crises in Honduras and El Salvador. 

Meanwhile in America, illegal immigrants are breaking into our neighborhoods, building our homes, becoming doctors. It's just an incomparable situation, and saying Mexico = America is baffling hypocrisy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Right, but having a "like" population somewhere does matter for something.

much "like" apartheid!

 As an example, look at how Russia used the presence of ethnic Russians as their (superficial) justification for annexing Crimea.

Mexico = Russia?? Texas = Crimea?? OMG, do you think illegal immigration is Mexico's secret plan to retake the Aztec homeland??

 If you don't have borders then you don't have countries. 

God forbid we become such a wretched world! No one to bomb, no one to exile, no one to scapegoat - it sounds miserable!

 The only person intimating immigrants as enemies is you.

You're the only person comparing Latin American immigrants to armed troops occupying Crimea...

 WASHINGTON, March 1  President Reagan said today that the rebels seeking to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government were the ''moral equal of our Founding Fathers.''

 In a speech to the annual conference of the Conservative Political Action Conference here, he renewed his call for Congressional approval of $14 million in aid for the rebels.

 Mr. Reagan also strongly appealed for support of the proposed research program on a space-based defense system against nuclear weapons and said conservative ideology was now the mainstream of American public thought. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had to look up what was on that hill - it's a [45-meter stone statue of the Madonna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Panecillo) [(photo by Melinda Henne),](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DXVZlIDrR94/U7CHvRnYkVI/AAAAAAAAEsY/kaEzmB5eSnI/s1600/) modeled after [the Virgin of Quito,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_of_Quito) also called the *Virgin of the Apocalypse*. It shows Mary standing atop the globe and crushing a snake. The hill 'El Panecillo' (or 'Little Loaf') itself was apparently a volcano (Quito is surrounded by them). [Here's another photo of the hill from the Basilica taken by Colin Stump.](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CXrlz7CJqKg/TuMraMbV81I/AAAAAAAAEEU/44w5ysCuMvs/s1600/El+Panecillo+from+La+Basilica.jpg) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The U.S. passenger port at San Ysidro is the busiest in the Western Hemisphere, and the cargo crossing point in Otay Mesa is the second busiest on the U.S.-Mexico border, processing more than 6,000 trucks a day. Including non-cargo traffic, it's over 130,000 vehicles - a large portion of which are commuters as well as tourists and travelers. 

The large cross-border traffic generates billions of dollars in taxable business income for San Diego, and delays in cross-border traffic are estimated to cost millions in opportunity losses, as well as costing thousands of jobs. Traffic demand is so high, 60% of cross-border travelers say they'd be willing to pay a toll to use a faster entry port. </TEXT>
