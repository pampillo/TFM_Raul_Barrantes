<TEXT> This is a systemic cultural issue wrapped up with a lot of other systemic cultural issues. There is a trend here to an extent, of boys not being interested in girls, in favor of anime and games - which is potentially destructive in and of itself - but the same is also true for a great many girls who have equally no interest in boys. So thats not really the main factor. 

Their work culture makes it wholly impractical to even attempt raising children. They're expected - and in most cases obliged - to work 15-18 hour days as standard, and don't always get paid - or request payment - for that overtime. Why even bother having kids if you cant be a parent? So thats another factor. 

As for the older women having children, trust me its nothing to do with going abroad - most japanese people have an innate aversion to foreign people - and is most likely due to a recent trend of "friendship marriage" marrying a friend to satisfy your familys desire that you get married and have a kid - social norms are very important here - and that these usually happen later in life when people have given up searching for a partner. 

This is a very very complex issue and its relation to MGTOW ideology is tangental at best.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Some speculation about the new live shows (and Japan)... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-31 16:28:59 </DATE>

<TEXT> Seeing as they just announced they're playing at FujiRock (I live in Japan so I'm VERY happy about that, but also pissed off as tickets to fujirock are like $200), now's about as good a time as any to put this idea out there. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSyWtESoeOc

Do any of you know about Hatsune Miku? Sorry if it's been brought up here before - im kind of new - She's a virtual singer/pop star in Japan. Her songs are made by her fans and a handful of artists. The company that owns the character scour the fansites for good songs and a lot of producers have actually become famous because of it. 

Her live shows - of which the one posted is very old - basically involve augmented reality. A projection of her performs center stage while a live band are visible through the sheet she's being projected onto. 

It creates the illusion that she's actually on stage with real people - which she kind of is, as the band are all playing live. 

Personally, I would love to see a return to the brit-performance style show, with the characters performing. This tech seems perfect for doing something like that. 

Thoughts?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dunno why but I have this weird feeling that he's going to do something really unexpected. Just thinking about how Conor works, he loves to prove people wrong. With all the talk about how he 'cant make 145 anymore' I have this sick sense that that's exactly what he's gonna do. 

I mean it's totally up in the air, but I would imagine his next fight will HAVE to be a title defense. Despite what Dana has been saying, I can't see him giving up a belt, or Dana making him. Think about it. Say he vacates the featherweight belt, all featherweight fights are basically relegated to the pre-lims. Aldo is most likely retired, no one actually beat the new champ, who honestly gives a shit? I don't see Dana doing that. I think he'll allow Conor to keep both under the condition that he defends them both at least twice in 2017 or something like that. That's just my feeling. 

As for who, I think Aldo is out of the picture honestly. McGregor v Edgar is the only featherweight defense that makes any sense. Lightweight it's gotta be Khabib, right? Especially after all the shit that's gone on. Nate 3 is tantalizing but I think the lightweight division would fucking strike or something if Nate skipped the queue; that would just be a middle finger to everyone there.

<TEXT> That he hasnt defended the featherweight belt is a fair criticism for sure. And i guess going forward his next fight will probably have to be a defense of one of the belts. But I disagree about edgar being a grevious omission. Did you see edgar/aldo at 200? That was embarrassing. Edgar looked like a schoolboy trying to fight someones older brother in the schoolyard. Conor would tower over him and reach wise edgar wouldnt get close. Like, he beat the best in the division. Unbeaten champ for ten years. Slept in 13 seconds. Thats enough of a statement for me. 

BUT that criticism absolutely holds water now in the lightweight division. He DID skip the queue here. Thats impossible to deny. So we'll see what happens next.   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, literally every time conor fights, his opponent is touted as "the answer" to his dominance. 

Talk of mendes pre-fight: 
- amazing wrestler. Nightmare match up for conor. 
Result: 2nd round ko. 

Talk of aldo pre-fight: 
- different beast. Pound for pound best in the world. A nightmare for conor. 
Result: 1st round ko in 13 seconds, fastest title acquisition in ufc history. 

Loses to diaz, owns the loss. 

Talk of diaz pre-fight 2: 
- too much for conor. Outclassed on the ground. 
Result: win by decision, scored 3 knock-downs, defended all but one takedown attempts.  

Talk of alvarez pre-fight: 
- different beast. Nightmare for conor. 
Result: 2nd round - practically effortless - ko. First ufc dual weight champion. 

Im genuinely curious, what exactly WILL it take for people to stop talking shit? Conors persona elicits and invites hyperbole, but the evidence that he is as good as he says vastly outweighs the evidence that he isnt. And yet this cycle is ALREADY starting up again with talk of Khabib being "a nightmare" for conor. 

So honestly, what would it take to shut people up? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is very likely. Japanese people learn english (in japan. Obviously this doesnt apply to japanese people like shuri, raised abroad) through katakana, their loan-word alphabet, sonically identical to their hiragana alphabet. So unless they actively pursue english study, they end up speaking in that heavy syllabic way and more often than not cant understand native pronunciation even for words they know. 

As an example, when I first moved here i went to starbucks and asked for a vanilla latte. Met with blank confusion. When i adjusted to "banira rateh" she got it immediately. 

It took a long time for me to be comfortable speaking english like that without feeling like some sort of racist lol

He's obviously a great fighter, but he's also the best salesman in the ufc right now. Not only is he better than everyone else at selling fights, mostly everyone else sucks at selling fights. Michael Bisping is the only other UFC fighter that can showboat, like McGregor, and even he's only getting a chance to do it recently. Not everyone likes the trash talk (bit WWE, I get it) but McGregor is making the UFC more money than anyone else on their roster. That's why he gets overpaid.  </TEXT>

For the record john kavanagh didnt want him to take the nate rematch either, so idk if his coach will necessarily get what he wants. I really cant see him simply vacating that belt. Losing it, sure, maybe. But i don't think he'll choose to lose it without a fight.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ive heard a lot of people saying he wont go back to 145 but his whole ambition was to be a dual-weight champion. If dana is like "defend or vacate" i reckon he'll defend it. Win or lose, then is the time to move to 155. That makes more sense to me. 

Why are so many people sure he'll vacate the belt? Ive never heard anyone on the inside say that, and he explicitly denied it at the presser anyway. 

Sounds to me like a lot of people WANT him to vacate the belt. Which is a different thing entirely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Go to dear stage in akihabara. Its 1000 yen in and is basically a live venue where the staff are wannabe pop stars and perform multiple live sets every night. If you don't care and "j-pop" is as specific as they're willing to be, dear stage should do the trick. 

If there is a particular j-pop act they want to see, good luck with that. Tickets for anyone even moderately well known are gold dust. Especially the bigger acts, where ticket sales are allocated by an actual lottery. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, myself and another redditor are in the process of putting together a comprehensive guide to akihabaras maid cafes, so i think i might actually be able to help someone here for once. 

If you want something a little more chilled out than the usual maid cafe spectacle, Honey Honey is the one you want. Its got all the novelty with none of the mayhem and unlike just about every other maid cafe, the food is actually pretty damn good. 

If you WANT the typical o.t.t act, i'd recommend @home cafe. Its menu is set up to make it the easiest and most efficient experience for newcomers, and some of the maids are fluent in english. 

Hope that helps! Any questions, just ask :) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Macheads. I need assistance. I bought a second hand macbook pro, its in good nick, but was cheap because the disc drive doesnt work and It didnt come with OS installed. I dont use cds and i was planning on using my boot disk anyway. 

I checked with the staff that this was possible, he showed me the mac booting up from an external boot disk and showed me all the info on the internal disk. 

At present, it boots from my boot disk no problem and runs beautifully. But the internal hard disk isnt showing up in the finder, thus not showing up in super duper either, so i cant clone my external to it. The internal drive shows up in disk utility, but thats it. It looks like i can erase it if i want, i havent because im not sure it will help, but the repair options are all greyed out. 

Any ideas? </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as im aware the imperial palace is locked most of the year, so aside from the emperors birthday and another date i cant remember, you cant actually get into the grounds. It could be worth seeing anyway, but something to consider. 

If its architecture you're after you should try get to kawagoe, its in saitama, bout an hour by the tobu-tojo line from tokyo, but really beautiful town, a whole section of it is almost exclusively traditional japanese architecture.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Japanese girls are normal girls. Some will like you, some wont. No mystery there, im afraid. 

Ive been here just under a year, i also produce music and am trying to break into the scenes through a few projects with japanese friends. My advice would be to use meet up or conversation exchange to meet people with similar interests, or an interest in speaking english, they are out there. 

Your aversion to mainstream definitely isnt helping, but thatd be the same anywhere really when you think about it. As others before me have said, those scenes are cliquey by nature. Breaking in is difficult, even more so with a language barrier. 

My advice is to try the meetup app, conversationexchange.com, or go to any Hub. You'll be fine, you just need to branch out a bit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exhausted. Its an emotionally draining game. In a good way. 

Emi, i got more invested in her than i ever expected to. I played the game mostly out of curiosity, but it hooked me. She felt like a real person, they all do, the writing is amazing in that regard, and by the end of her route it felt like i had been personally involved. And i guess in a way we all were, but few games ive ever played created that kind of agency or evoked that kind of attachment in me. 

And no shame about the tears. We all know that feel.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> GOOD QUESTION!
I toyed around with some Haganai clips and that wonderful bit of the first episode of Oreimo where Kirino is searching under the bed, but ultimately it came down to one winner for me:

Panty   Stocking With Garterbelt. Episode 6. 11.58. 

i.e: one appearance of their epic transformation scenes. Fan service at its finest, ladies and gentlemen. 

Thanks for running the comp :) </TEXT>
