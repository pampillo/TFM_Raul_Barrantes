<TITLE> The Family (2013) - Brown Water Flows Through a Top Notch Film </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-06 02:35:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I dont understand why this movie was received with such horrid negativity as if it was the worst movie ever made.   For heaven's sake--all Giovanni Manzoni wanted was clear, not brown water and by God, he did something about it. No kidding. Something quite unusual but that's all I'll comment about it. You simply have to see how Mr.Di Niro a.k.a Manzoni solves this rather perplexing problem.

What a beautifully written, directed and acted film about an all-American family in the witness protection program, hiding out and being protected by Tommy Lee Jones and his agents in Normandy, France. A treasure of a concocted mixture of levity, satire, sarcasm, assault, battery and murder emanating from each of the four Manzoni family members. Gio, his wife, daughter 17 years old and son, a meek, quiet 14 year old unless you tick him off. And the same goes for that gorgeous sister of his who's easy on the eyes but what a temper, fists and knee.

"The Family," all about stateside mobsters seeking revenge for having been snitched on, is NOT meant to be taken as seriously as, for instance, "Goodfellas" and "Casino." On the contrary. It's sort of like a tongue-in-cheek story of vicious folks, if such a thing is possible. Honest injun---this movie is a potpourri of cornball,bullets, bombs and bursting sides with laughter. A "don't miss-flick." </TEXT>

<TEXT> ok, I have a question. Assuming the underlying cause of the civil war as you have put it was slavery ,  the question still remains, did the northern states go to war sacrificing thousands of men out of the goodness of their heart for the black man held in slavery or because of the economic ramification of having a free labor source that steals employments from the working man in the north? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've said this before on this sub but I'll say it again..

In a few words, "The Last Kingdom" is all I wanted to see in "Vikings" and I never did. Do your self  favor and start watching this amazing show

The plot is vigorous and every episode is full of twists: we don't wait around for things to happen, they happen. And they don't feel the need to keep half of the episode dull or in a slow pace, just to make some moments stand out, you won't leave your screen for a second because it's all interesting.
Acting, that was my major disappointment with "vikings", is good: let's not fool ourselves, just being intense is not acting, you have to give more to the characters to make them real people.
Although it's filmed mostly in gray, "winterish" colors photography is impressive, full of beautiful wild pictures.
The director has done a good job too, no weird or off center angles where you can't see the face of the actor and you try to guess, no jumpy cameras that make you dizzy and lose focus. The camera follows the action and the feelings and does the intended: it tells the story. Note that there are no obscene sex scenes and meaningless splatter violence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hands down my favorite movie of 2015.This is the kind of movie that would make you want to watch it again and again just to revisit some of the amazing scenes and the way the story is told. A comedy with twists and actually a very good story. What I enjoyed the most about this movie is the way scenes are used to sometimes give unnecessary long shots to unimportant parts and swiftly showing you what action is taking place in various parts. Its not bad, the way they are stitched together keeps your mood light the entire time and you get an occasional laugh at some silly situations.

<TITLE> A sequel in the works for The Man From U.N.C.L.E. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-16 22:44:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I loved The Man From U.N.C.L.E. next to The Bourne Trilogy and Casino Royale it is my most beloved Spy movie of all times and I am ecstatic it is getting a Sequel. I was a bit worried that wont be the case because the movie found itself in the unique position of not fitting into the genre it was marketed for. I put this in the same category of "The Princess Bride." It was an unfortunate release in theaters because the marketing department did not know how to send this out to an audience that appreciates exceptional writing, smart acting, great directing, well crafted character development and a story that does not fit into a simple box of "Action" or "Drama" or "Comedy."  It also did not help that they released it along with MI5.

The Man From U.N.C.L.E is truly a fantastic movie that plays to a full story experience. Characters start with depth and grow and progress. Comedy and whit take the place of bad acting. Exceptional writers and directors take the film to a level of making the audience think and become attached to these characters.  As always, Ritchie cleverly subverts each set-piece, letting chase scenes unfold in carefully staged but enjoyably inventive ways, often putting the real action in the background while the characters act as if they're above all this nastiness.

<TITLE> Killer Elite (2011) was one of the better thinking man's action flick in recent memory </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Killer Elite is a macho-action-thriller that didn't have an A-list budget, but probably didn't really need it, either. This movie has an unusual plot in that one is never certain who are the good guys and the bad guys. In fact, by the end of the movie, that question is still unanswered but by then it really doesn't matter because the story is more than just about good versus bad. The fact that the movie was based on an excellent book didnt hurt either. 


Don't know that Jason Statham's a great actor, exactly, but he's definitely a presence and he's got others to do the acting around him, and he performs in a several action scenes that come right up to the edge without getting silly. And I liked the basic plausibility in most of the scenes.

Here are some scenes from the movie [Spoiler Alert]

<TEXT> Imma just post this comment from youtube.
To everyone who's confused, here's what the video is about:
It's showing what little, often unintentional acts of racism by white people feel like by switching the roles (no "whiteface" isn't racist because there's not historical racism associated with it unlike blackface, look up blackface in minstrel shows if you want to know why blackface is racist today).  As you can see, black people are the majority race in this video, and there are posters of smiling black people on the walls.  When the white people walk in, the manager tells the saleswoman to "watch out", much like how black people are often  watched closely and followed in stores.  Then, when they start talking, she tries too hard to relate to them and it just comes off as awkward, forced, and makes her seem uncomfortable.  This would be like a white person saying "I love hip-hop homie, my favorite rapper is Soulja Boy."  Finally, she says "I'm not racist I don't see color" which is a common argument mostly used by racist white people.  There's nothing wrong with seeing color, and you're lying if you say you don't notice someone's color (unless you're color blind.)  The problem is discriminating off of color, just ignoring race and hoping it goes away isn't going to solve anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The last kingdom

In a few words, "The Last Kingdom" is all I wanted to see in "Vikings" and I never did.

The plot is vigorous and every episode is full of twists: we don't wait around for things to happen, they happen. And they don't feel the need to keep half of the episode dull or in a slow pace, just to make some moments stand out, you won't leave your screen for a second because it's all interesting.

Acting, that was my major disappointment with "vikings", is good: let's not fool ourselves, just being intense is not acting, you have to give more to the characters to make them real people.

Although it's filmed mostly in gray, "winterish" colors photography is impressive, full of beautiful wild pictures.

The director has done a good job too, no weird or off center angles where you can't see the face of the actor and you try to guess, no jumpy cameras that make you dizzy and lose focus. The camera follows the action and the feelings and does the intended: it tells the story. Note that there are no obscene sex scenes and meaningless splatter violence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For those who do not know this is the fate of  maids from African and Asian countries that end up working in the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia. Their passports are taken from them as soon as they land so they are left upon the mercy of their employers who often beat them , rape them, throw boiling water at them and work them to death.So most are forced to take thier own lives rather than suffer the agony of slaving for days under torture. As part of an NGO who help these women  I have seen many cases which broke my heart and often leave me sleepless at night. There was a case of Saudi couple who  hammer 24 nails into Sri Lankan maid and most if not all of the accusers are often sent scott free either by paying blood money to their families or by a justice system that openly defends the accusers. It is a never ending torture for these girls working in Arab countries. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TLDR: Prisoner put in boiling hot shower for making a mess, prison guards not charged with a crime.

In June of 2012, 50-year old Darren Rainey, a schizophrenic man serving time for cocaine possession, died in the Dade Correctional Institution. According to prison witnesses and civil rights groups, Rainey died after guards locked him in a shower for two hours with water at 180 degrees Fahrenheit. Nurses who examined Rainey said that he had burns over 90 percent of his bodyand that his skin fell off at the touch.

According to an autopsy report released in January by the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner, Rainey died from complications of schizophrenia, heart disease and confinement in the shower.

On Friday, more than four years after Raineys death, the office of Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle stated that they would not be seeking charges against the four correctional officers allegedly involved in Raineys death.

The shower was itself neither dangerous nor unsafe, the report read. The evidence does not show that Raineys well-being was grossly disregarded by the correctional staff.

According to the report, the facts and evidence in this case do not meet the required elements for the filing of any criminal charge. Therefore, none of the correctional officers at Dade C.I. are criminally responsible for the death of inmate Rainey. Based upon the foregoing, we close the investigation without filing any criminal charges.

At least six inmate witnesses said that correctional officers had rigged the shower so that they could control the temperature from the outside, and that they purposefully turned the water to temperatures that scalded Rainey. The inmate witnesses also claim that Rainey could be heard kicking the shower door and screaming Please take me out! I cant take it anymore!

Prosecutors rejected those witness accounts, calling the testimony unreliable and not credible.

Milton Grimes, the attorney representing Raineys family, expressed extreme disappointment with the states decision.

We are appalled that the state attorney did not look deeper into this case and see the criminality of the people who were involved, Grimes told the Miami Herald.

A Miami Herald investigation into the Dade Correctional Institution called it the deadliest prison in Florida, and chronicled a litany of abuses suffered by inmates at the hands of correctional officers. Around the same time as Raineys death, another mentally ill inmate hanged himself from an air conditioning vent, leaving behind a list of alleged abuses he suffered in the prison.

In 2016, 16 inmates died while in custody at the Dade Correctional Institution. Throughout the entire state, 356 inmates died in custody, according to numbers provided to the Miami Herald by the Florida Department of Corrections.

<TEXT> that is wrong according to Brits report in 58 % of the cases the perpetuator was entirely unknown to the victim. And in only 13 % of the cases were the perpetuator close to the victim. It is also wrong that most of the perpetuaors are domestic for the basic reason that the sweedish government has stopped taking the ethnicity of attackers just to  distance themselves from taking blame. Whtever your argument or conviction is it takes only to be human to understand that getting a 180 hrs community service  punishment for raping a 12 years old is not only wrong but shameful.

<TEXT> Well it isn't totally unreasonable to assume that, considering the many reports of rapes on women and few cases happening to minors.Like the , 27 years old man acquitted of raping 13-year-old girl in Sweden because she looks well developed... and another case where another 13 years old was anally raped and got only 2 months sentence. And more recently a teenager in a wheelchair was raped by 4 men for hours. The men were sent scott free and the girl and other swedes who held a peaceful march supporting her  were shunned by the media and some sjw's.  It might not be happening every second but they do happen and sadly most go under reported. My girl friend is Swedish thus my interest on the matter.

<TEXT> Haile Selassie's speech to the league of Nations.  They stood by and watched when Italy invaded Ethiopia and issued a toothless weapon's embargo on both Italy and Ethiopia which only affected Ethiopia; because italy already had an arm's industry. Haile Selassie went to the league and made a speech that earned him Times man of the year and a legendary status among world leaders  when he spoke the prophetic words "...today it is us, tomorrow it will be you" among a chorus of cheers and a few boo's from Italian representatives. And surely enough, Hitler invaded Poland shortly after, exploiting the league's appeasement policy- with the knowledge that the league was powerless to prevent it and started the second world war.

<TITLE> Just got around to watch "Allied"- A well made and nostalgic rendering of Bogart's "Casablanca" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-08 07:17:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I went to this film with low expectations as I had read some lukewarm reviews that now, after my actual viewing experience, now seem like sour-grapes. This is an excellent film that is very much worth watching.

The war film genre, especially the ww2 war film genre, is not filled with a high proportion of truly great films - most descend to low brow action, jingoism and gratuitous content where any kind of thoughtful investigation of the characters' personalities, motivations et c. are left out.

Here is a film with an uncharacteristically low key, subtle and relatively flat content and plot line as we watch the characters interacting as time passes - we are presented with repeated scenes of Marianne (Cotillard) and Max (Pitt) talking, smoking, making love, making war and hanging out domestically - the result is we get a rather detailed insight into how these two live through what they are going through (not a typical war film agenda). The acting is impeccable, the script excellent and the production values very well done.

Robert Zemeckis has helmed a film that is in every respect worthy of his formidable talent and illustrious filmography. With him in the director's chair, Allied's great production values were more or less expected. The film offers beautiful costuming inspired by Casablanca and Now, Voyager, exhilarating and suspenseful action scenes helped by a humanized protagonist  and a very well-told, poignant story of happiness despite a world gone mad.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seeing that Ethiopia was already embroiled with internal affairs of sucession, The Egyptians under the Ottoman empire invaded Ethiopia in thier conquest to create an empire in East Africa, though they were heavily armed especially In comparison to the Ethiopian army and had launching  pads in all four countries that neighboured Ethiopia, they under estimated the national fervor and unity  of the locals when they were under foreign attack, and were also held at a geographical a disadvantage. The entire Egyptian army was decimated and the khedive had to retreat, his son raised an army few years later and attacked in a feat of revenge, he too was defeated and Ottoman ambitions in eastern Africa were crushed. But the Europeans arrived a few years later and Italy had to learn the same lesson again. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-02-07 11:12:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The comparison is  merited not because they are both space adventures but because both were grossly underrated at the time of release. Movie critics and goers alike walked out of  2001 ASO when it was first screened but today it is regarded as  one of the hallmarks on cinema. Passengers has a  1.4 score on Roger Ebert and 33% on Rotten Tomatoes, but I think it was one of the best movies on 2016 and definitely on of the best of its genre. The acting was great, pacing was good and never boring,the action sequence and the visuals were amazing as well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> indie movie I saw, I think it came out in 2010's maybe 2014. I cant quite remember the plot. But it was about this guy , I think he checked into a hotel and notices this rich young girl in a swimming pool who liked him. afterwards he along with her and her friends gathered for a drink and later he told her he has a wife and she told him she doesn't care who he goes out with as long as he is with her. I am sure there is a lot to the story and I just wrote a whole lot of blubber but that is all I remember. Me and my friends were talking about it but for the life of me I cant remember the title or anything about it. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> indie movie I saw, I think it came out in 2010's maybe 2014. I cant quite remember the plot. But it was about this guy , I think he checked into a hotel and notices this rich young girl in a swimming pool who liked him. afterwards he along with her and her friends gathered for a drink and later he told her he has a wife and she told him she doesn't care who he goes out with as long as he is with her. I am sure there is a lot to the story and I just wrote a whole lot of blubber but that is all I remember. Me and my friends were talking about it but for the life of me I cant remember the title or anything about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Snipet is from hearing of the tape they made killing their last victim, 16 yrs old shirley lynette ledford. These torture/rape sessions didn't last a couple of hours. Some of these girls were held for days, tortured non-stop. The 5th victim Lynette Ledford, the one who is on the audio tape, was physically destroyed. Norris wasn't even able to commit his rape because Bittaker inserted his pliers inside her vaginal and anal cavities and literally ripped her apart. He was doing that on the audio tape. I've never heard a human being scream in pain like I heard on that tape. For those who want to hear it, TRUST ME, you DON'T. I'm not squeamish, I've seen some terrible things. I've seen some of Maury Travis' videos of his murders. But the Ledford tape is in a category all its own. I wish I never heard it. Of the 25 students in my criminology class only 3 of us stayed in the room. Many dropped the class. Others vomited. It's 18 minutes of the most unbelievably brutal acts imaginable. I don't have many regrets in my life. But I seriously regret listening to that tape. I wish I could get it out of my head. No matter how I try to describe the tape it's not really possible. The fact that a human being did this to another is too much. Bittaker not only LOVED what he did, he listened to the tape constantly and even let neighborhood kids hear it. They reportedly thought it was fake. That's what gets you, that it sounds like a fake "Hollywood" actress screaming. But it's real. It makes perfect sense that the FBI uses the tape to train new agents. It's the most heartbreaking thing I've ever experienced. I don't cry often but I don't mind saying I cried like a baby, almost uncontrollably. It's not an experience I'd wish on anyone. I bet Bittaker would enjoy hearing that this tape has caused 35 years of sadness and pain to anyone who hears it. If anyone on Earth deserves the death penalty it's Bittaker. The only problem would be that he could only die once. There is a special place reserved for him in hell.

<TEXT> yeah you are right better listen to  the grunts and interjections of  this lame ass trap niggas who say nothing at all. If you really listen to his songs his lyrics are very deep and intuned check out Ill Mind Of Hopsin 7 and tell me any rapper with a lyrics half as deep.. yhea go on down vote this too see if I give a fck lol
Yo, fuck anybody I might alarm

Life is a tour, I sit and ride along

Taking some notes and then I write the song

I'm staring down the road my life has gone

Is this where I belong?

Is it wrong to not believe in right and wrong?

My mental state is fucking me up

And I cried upon while asking you for some answers

But we don't have that type of bond

That my desires gone with the way that I've been living lately

If I died right now, you'd turn the fire on

Sick of this bullshit, niggas call me a sellout

'Cause I hopped on Christianity so strongly then I fell out

Now I'm avoiding questions like a scared dog with his tail down

I look at the Earth and Sun and I can tell a genius man designed it

It's truly mind blowing, I can't deny it

Is heaven real? Is it fake? Is it really how I fantasize it?

Where's the Holy Ghost at? How long it take Man to find it?

My mind's a nonstop tape playing and I can't rewind it

You gave me a bible and expect me not to analyze it

I'm frustrated and you provoked it

I'm not reading that motherfucking book because a human wrote it

I have a fucking brain, you should know it

You gave it to me to think to avoid every useless moment

It was a mission that I had to abort

'Cause humans be lying with such an inaccurate source

It's gon' be hard to put me back on the course

Next Jehovah's witness to come on my porch, I swear I'm slammin' the door

A lot of folks believe it though, but I'm not surprised

Humans are fucking dumb, still thinkin' that Pac's alive

<TEXT> I agree with that but how about Russia? Russia is advancing deaper and deaper in to the arctic drilling for oil and releasing tons of methane gas in the process. Unless they is a  legitimate agreement between countries that claim the arctic circle ie- Canada, US, Russia and Denamark it doesnt make sence to stop only American companies from exploring the Arctic, some might even say unpatriotic.

Here is a very explanatory video on  the geo-politics of the Arctic, I highly recommend you watch it.

<TEXT> The Snipet is from hearing of the tape they made killing their last victim, 16 yrs old shirley lynette ledford. These torture/rape sessions didn't last a couple of hours. Some of these girls were held for days, tortured non-stop. The 5th victim Lynette Ledford, the one who is on the audio tape, was physically destroyed. Norris wasn't even able to commit his rape because Bittaker inserted his pliers inside her vaginal and anal cavities and literally ripped her apart. He was doing that on the audio tape. I've never heard a human being scream in pain like I heard on that tape. For those who want to hear it, TRUST ME, you DON'T. I'm not squeamish, I've seen some terrible things. I've seen some of Maury Travis' videos of his murders. But the Ledford tape is in a category all its own. I wish I never heard it. Of the 25 students in my criminology class only 3 of us stayed in the room. Many dropped the class. Others vomited. It's 18 minutes of the most unbelievably brutal acts imaginable. I don't have many regrets in my life. But I seriously regret listening to that tape. I wish I could get it out of my head. No matter how I try to describe the tape it's not really possible. The fact that a human being did this to another is too much. Bittaker not only LOVED what he did, he listened to the tape constantly and even let neighborhood kids hear it. They reportedly thought it was fake. That's what gets you, that it sounds like a fake "Hollywood" actress screaming. But it's real. It makes perfect sense that the FBI uses the tape to train new agents. It's the most heartbreaking thing I've ever experienced. I don't cry often but I don't mind saying I cried like a baby, almost uncontrollably. It's not an experience I'd wish on anyone. I bet Bittaker would enjoy hearing that this tape has caused 35 years of sadness and pain to anyone who hears it. If anyone on Earth deserves the death penalty it's Bittaker. The only problem would be that he could only die once. There is a special place reserved for him in hell. </TEXT>

So lets take the fun out of it. Add typical Tom Cruise running, CGI's, loud explosions and one liners that we're supposed to take serious. Oh and the mummy is now female. Brendan Fraser and Arnold Vosloo would roll over in their acting career grave. </TEXT>

<TEXT> thanks for the awesome questions. I must admit I haven't seen any movie by those two, doing a quick google they were pretty much the Cohen brothers of their day. I'll be sure to check out a few of their movies. Movies have always been an escape to me growing up and I love story telling so that is how I got started. a few old movies probably everything by Buster Keaton, Wings(1927) for [its brilliant cinematography](https://gfycat.com/VeneratedFluidGroundbeetle), 12 angry men, benhur, Dr. Strangelove or, The third man, psycho, citizen kane. The problem with today's cinema I think is it tries to appeal to the wider mass by having a Lacklustre story and focusing on action sequences movies like the fast and furious and the latest installment of bourne come to mind. Apart from the USA Japan, France and Italy have vibrant cinema's imo. Movies to watch in a cloudy day

I would have to say  La Dolce Vita because that is my dads favorite movie. The 60's and early 70s were the golden age of Italian Cinema I would say.Although there are  recent classics that I like like Malena and Gomorrah. I dont think watching movies in VHS would become a trend because you would have to replace quality just for a period piece equipment. </TEXT>

Comedians like Patrice o  Neal, Dave chapel, Chris rock, eddy Murphy, Richard Pryor. Those guys are actually funny even though they repeat thier lines for effect.

<TITLE> Keeping Up With the Joneses Review </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-24 18:47:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Did Any one watch the movie? I dont understand why it flopped in the box office , I thought it was a decent comedy.


Keeping Up with the Joneses has this great nostalgic feeling, a kick back to those wonderful 80's comedies that fuse action and humor, while actually making you care for what the characters are going through. It's a bit of the oddball The 'Burbs with elements of classic spy flicks like True Lies or Mr.   Mrs. Smith. Zach Galifianakis is hardly recognizable, after shedding most of his weight, but he still keeps his iconic lovable every-man persona intact. He's also one of two things that keep Joneses moving in a smooth pace, with his perfect timing and hilarious delivery making way for tons of good laughs. Isla Fisher does a decent job at portraying Karen Gaffney (opposite Galifianakis's Jeff), a 40 something mom leading a rather dull life in suburban America, who finds her semi-average life challenged when a new couple moves next door. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Snipet is from hearing  of the tape they made killing their last victim, 16 yrs old [shirley lynette ledford](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/57/Shirley_Lynette_Ledford_Sunland-Tujunga_1979.jpg). These torture/rape sessions didn't last a couple of hours. Some of these girls were held for days, tortured non-stop. The 5th victim Lynette Ledford, the one who is on the audio tape, was physically destroyed. Norris wasn't even able to commit his rape because Bittaker inserted his pliers inside her vaginal and anal cavities and literally ripped her apart. He was doing that on the audio tape. I've never heard a human being scream in pain like I heard on that tape. For those who want to hear it, TRUST ME, you DON'T. I'm not squeamish, I've seen some terrible things. I've seen some of Maury Travis' videos of his murders. But the Ledford tape is in a category all its own. I wish I never heard it. Of the 25 students in my criminology class only 3 of us stayed in the room. Many dropped the class. Others vomited. It's 18 minutes of the most unbelievably brutal acts imaginable. I don't have many regrets in my life. But I seriously regret listening to that tape. I wish I could get it out of my head. No matter how I try to describe the tape it's not really possible. The fact that a human being did this to another is too much. Bittaker not only LOVED what he did, he listened to the tape constantly and even let neighborhood kids hear it. They reportedly thought it was fake. That's what gets you, that it sounds like a fake "Hollywood" actress screaming. But it's real. It makes perfect sense that the FBI uses the tape to train new agents. It's the most heartbreaking thing I've ever experienced. I don't cry often but I don't mind saying I cried like a baby, almost uncontrollably. It's not an experience I'd wish on anyone. I bet Bittaker would enjoy hearing that this tape has caused 35 years of sadness and pain to anyone who hears it. If anyone on Earth deserves the death penalty it's Bittaker. The only problem would be that he could only die once. There is a special place reserved for him in hell. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trailer- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxPApTGWwas

With the plethora of mediocre historical series out there, I did not expect much from this show. I, however, was utterly blown away by how compelling it is, and by the excellent acting by all. The subject matter is fascinating, and it depicts well the harshness of living, and surviving, in a barbarous world, with an emerging, equally barbarous "new" religion. The casting was terrific. The actor who played Scorpa, the Dane of the White Horse, was beyond fierce. An unforgettable presence. I was especially, impressed by the lead, Alexander Dreymon, whom I had never seen before. As the series progresses, you really see this guy's acting chops. His range is from the tender to the ferocious.  

  The characters and the actions are well developed, the landscapes are amazing, the dialogue is also incredible. Everything is just outstanding and introduces the viewer in the period which the show represents. I'm so happy i gave it a shot and I want it so badly to continue for at least a couple more seasons. Oh, if only more series would be as good as this one, but unfortunately it's really hard theses days for a show to stand out, considering how many there are out there. So all I can really say is The Last Kingdom is a masterpiece so far and it really should be continued. Well done with the casting and the director is really good.

And yes it is better than History channels Vikings. No matter how much I like the latter.


If you watched it and like it you can vote for it to be nominated as it has been shortlisted for this years National Television Awards for Best Period Drama

<TEXT> Different strokes for different folks then, I watched my first episode with tears of laughter streaming down my face. It  is hilarious because the guests are put through some of the funniest stuff I have ever seen! My only negative is the continued use of Jedward, but the games in which they are involved are mildly amusing and Keith often steals the lime light. I like the character Keith Lemon, he is funny, risky etc and i think if there was a different host, it wouldn't be celeb juice anymore, he would be missed, no one is as risky as him. It is not just him being funny, it is the things he says, they shock you, you wouldn't expect someone on TV to say the stuff he does so you laugh in shock. It makes a change from programmes being so serious and professional, c'mon it is good to see a show where celebs can be themselves and have a laugh instead of being stuck up and boring. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This happened me to 2 years ago, I was going to catch a train from asmara (Eritrea) to another town the next morning.Me and my dad had to talk to the city administration about my great grand fathers properties which included 3 factories, a hotel, mills and a cinema and houses in the capital that was nationalized by a communist government, but we couldn't get it back because Ethiopia and Eritrea separated afterwards. Anyways I was with my dad and I told him I'll take the next train tomorrow because I wanted to stroll in the city and it's beautiful architecture. I saw this really beautiful lady wearing red dress and a white scarf, kinda weird because every body was coming from church mass and every one was wearing white. I followed(stalked) her for a couple of long and twisted ailes like the onces inmedieval Italian cities, I saw her making a left so I started walking and made a left too , it was a dead end, there were no houses no nothing and she was gone, I was really perplexed. any ways I toured the city afterwards It was getting dark so I got a room at this old Italian built albergo, I got a keys to my room, I shut the door, locked the keys, set my alarm and went to bed. The next morning I was a going to catch my train when suddenly there was a lady in red sleeping next to me. It was the creepiest shit that's happened to me mostly because the door is still shut from the inside and there are no windows and I had seen the day before. I was going to wake her up and ask her questions but I was going to miss my train. I jolted out of there real quick.

<TEXT> indie movie I saw, I think it came out in 2010's maybe 2014. I cant quite remember the plot. But it was about this guy , I think he checked into a hotel and notices this rich young girl in a swimming pool who liked him. afterwards he along with her and her friends gathered for a drink and later he told her he has a wife and she told him she doesn't care who he goes out with as long as he is with her. I am sure there is a lot to the story and I just wrote a whole lot of blubber but that is all I remember. Me and my friends were talking about it but for the life of me I cant remember the title or anything about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> you are wrong. Cush never refered to all dark skinned sub saharans it reffered to a specific group of people  that were located south of Egypt. Some historians thing this is because the inhabitant of ancinet kush included most part of semetic Modern day Ethiopia as There are plenty of Axumite texts sound in modern day Sudan/Nubia . Others think this is because of axumite conquest which brought forth the doom of the nubian kingdom far after biblical times. In the new testament there is a story that  Philip the Evangelist was told by an angel to go to the road from Jerusalem to Gaza, and there he met the Ethiopian eunuch. He had been to Jerusalem to worship (Acts 8:27), and was returning home. This and the fact that Ethiopia is the only christian kingdom in the region and oldest christian kingdom in the world implies that kush/Ethiopia in the bible refers to  or includes for the most part semetic modern day Ethiopia. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Who else Hate the TV show Lucifer? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-21 02:35:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What's the point of this show other than to fill a time-slot vacated by other failed shows? The devil, the potent symbol of temptation and evil, is rehabilitated into an avenging cop wanna-be. Really? He's depicted as a Hollywoodesque alluring male fantasy-figure: well-groomed, athletic, with an upper-class British accent and possessing cool cars, clothes, and big boy materialistic toys. He's anti-children (i.e., anti-responsibility). Hmmm, a page taken out of the old, tired Play Boy magazine formula. Yawn. It lacks wit. Los Angeles as a surrogate Paradise Lost? Would have been amusing to see how the Devil would respond to a LA rush hour traffic jam or proselytizing Christian street-missionaries instead of stereotypical 'beautiful people' in night club shticks. We can only hope that Lucifer gets sent back to hell where he belongs in short order.

Just think of a happy thought and grab hold to it. what ever it is.. watching a rerun of our favorite movie in a rainy afternoon, traveling the world, reading a good book in a cafe. anything...and live for that moment. Even if you disregard my advice there are less painful ways to part than a bertha. Just hold on and take it one at a time. If you can't fix the things in your life( family, personal life) remember you can always start again. I hope this helped you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Been huge fan of American Horror story but lets be serious they weren't much of a horror genre as they were a thriller. And for the most part the scariest parts of the show have always been the intros except perhaps for Assylum. But Roanoke takes the edge as perhaps thier scariest season uptodate </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The net potential energy between two adjacent ions, EN, may be represented by: En= -A/r + B/r^n where r is the distance between two ions, and A, B, and n are empirical constants. Calculate the bonding energy Eo in terms of the parameters A, B, r and n using the following procedures: (a) Differentiate EN with respect to r, and then set the resulting expression equal to zero, since the curve of EN versus r is a minimum at Eo (i.e., dEN/dr = 0) (b) Solve for r in terms of A, B and n, which yields ro, the equilibrium inter-ionic spacing. (c) Determine the expression for Eo by substitution of ro into the above equation. Please Explain

<TEXT> Although there is no historical accord or written affirmation it is generally believed that Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia leased Djibouti to France for 99 years, from around 1894, after the French had (in 1885) established a presence among the Issa and Afar peoples and built a port city on land acquired from Issa notables. Djibout later declared its independence from France and became its own country. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Tool Box Killers. Mostly from hearing a snippet of the tape they made killing their last victim. The FBI use the tape now to desensitize their agents to the sounds of torture. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Bittaker_and_Roy_Norris https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fY7hRCQaUw

Here is the transcript of the tape. Be warned. It is NSFL

<TEXT> These documentaries don't always elaborate on the length of time these girls were held. These torture/rape sessions didn't last a couple of hours. Some of these girls were held for days, tortured non-stop. The 5th victim Lynette Ledford, the one who is on the audio tape, was physically destroyed. Norris wasn't even able to commit his rape because Bittaker inserted his pliers inside her vaginal and anal cavities and literally ripped her apart. He was doing that on the audio tape. I've never heard a human being scream in pain like I heard on that tape. For those who want to hear it, TRUST ME, you DON'T. I'm not squeamish, I've seen some terrible things. I've seen some of Maury Travis' videos of his murders. But the Ledford tape is in a category all its own.  I wish I never heard it. Of the 25 students in my criminology class only 3 of us stayed in the room. Many dropped the class. Others vomited. It's 18 minutes of the most unbelievably brutal acts imaginable. I don't have many regrets in my life. But I seriously regret listening to that tape. I wish I could get it out of my head. No matter how I try to describe the tape it's not really possible. The fact that a human being did this to another is too much. Bittaker not only LOVED what he did, he listened to the tape constantly and even let neighborhood kids hear it. They reportedly thought it was fake. That's what gets you, that it sounds like a fake "Hollywood" actress screaming. But it's real.  It makes perfect sense that the FBI uses the tape to train new agents.  It's the most heartbreaking thing I've ever experienced. I don't cry often but I don't mind saying I cried like a baby, almost uncontrollably. It's not an experience I'd wish on anyone. I bet Bittaker would enjoy hearing that this tape has caused 35 years of sadness and pain to anyone who hears it.  If anyone on Earth deserves the death penalty it's Bittaker. The only problem would be that he could only die once. There is a special place reserved for him in hell. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This movie made me want to leave after one hour, and kill myself after 2 hours. I am a huge Bourne fan I was very exited for Matt Damons return to the Bourne franchise. Also there was fresh face of Alicia Vikander and not so fresh face of Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent Cassel as the bad guy so what can go wrong? Well it turns out if you have a horrible script, plot that only a person who wears helmet indoors can consider exiting you are left with the biggest disappointment in the cinema this year.

Spoiler alert everybody! Jason Bourne walks for 2 hours, sometimes he remembers things sometimes he doesn't - the end.

So to conclude : Do not see this movie! I had to watch the trilogy the next morning just to get over the disappointment of the new Jason Bourne. </TEXT>

I am sure there is a lot to the story and I just wrote a whole lot of blubber but that is all I remember.

<TEXT> [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F1wrDsUqYc)


I'm baffled by some of the reviews I've seen of this film. It is one of those movies you rewatch once in a while.  I saw it again this weekend and it reminded me of how strong it was. Clive Owen and Jason Statham are both excellent as... elite killers. The action is great, the story is intricate and watching the plot unfold is just fun. You've got a group of mercenaries on a dubious mission, a group of ex-SAS stumbles on to them and then both sides are trying to figure out who the other guys are and what they're up to. Maybe it throws some people that there are no clear cut good guys and bad guys here. Both sides are essentially bad guys acting out of a questionable sense of what is right. But that's what made it interesting to me.

The theme of this movie is "intrigue." There are layers of protagonists with mysterious agendas. Not all the t's are crossed, but the main story holds firm.

Which is the story of a reluctant band of experienced mercenaries plotting to kill, one by one, several British citizens as payback for something they did in a British skirmish somewhere in the Middle East. Each kill has to be cleverly disguised as an "accident," and evidence of each successful plot has to be provided to the "client." To top it off, another layer of protagonists senses what is going on, and plots to stop said plotting. Intriguing, indeed!


The film is at it's best when Owen and Statham are on screen together either coming after each other, fighting or staring each other down. Add a gun wielding, ass kicking De Niro into the mix and I'm happy sitting in a dark theater and munching popcorn. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I'm curious as to why you are addressing Far Eastern Buddhists specifically as Burma/Myanmar is not even located in the Far East.

 The Far East also describes Southeast Asia, which includes such countries as Laos, Cambodia, Singapore, Burma and Vietnam
[source](https://www.reference.com/geography/countries-far-east-d47086edcb0eb869)

The reason of my inquiry is to understand why the budhists in burma are more violent than other budhist in the far east, considering other countries also have considerable religious and political ideology differences.
Islam has no qualm taking an eye for an eye you can ask any cleric, unlike the teaching of Buddhism that  professes kindness and compassion even  if you are wronged, which  makes their actions far more odious. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not just Qatar which seems to let off Qataris, there was also the case of a pedophile Qatari prince Hamid Bin Abdul Sa ni al Thani who had sex with 16 Czech minors, two of whom were under 11 according to other reports, but as usual, he was untouchable and repatriated back to Qatar http://ceskapozice.lidovky.cz/czechs...0_pozice_48137
Also there are far more extreme cases where Qataris are let off scot-free; a Qatari man raped a British teacher, stabbed her in the heart and then burnt her corpse in the desert, and the man who aided the rapist only got 3 years, and even worse the Qatari courts overturned the Qatari rapist-murderers punishment after the initial press outrage died down. He's now facing a retrial, while the victims mother barely has enough money to cover the legal costs and had to crowdfund it.
And even worse is how they treat the domestic servants. Hate to bring in nationality but in Qatar, nationality is everything. On top are Qataris, then GCC national, then professional white / arab expats, then a huge gap and all the African and Asian slaves at the bottom (88% of the country!). The only reason these cases are covered are because the victim is white. The millions of housemaids in the Gulf states are treated much worse and receive no justice whatsoever.
For instance; was the "Al Dhaid" murder case in the UAE, where 4 Emirati men kidnapped an Ethiopian maid, gang-raped her twice in different locations, then ran her over with a car and then proceeded to stone her to death with large rocks which smashed her skull into pieces.
After paying 200k dirhams ($50k) "blood money" in total (so around $12.5k each, a few months salary for an Emirati), they were released from prison. One of the attackers 13 years prior had raped and murdered a Pakistani little girl, but her father who was an imam forgave him.
So just to be clear, 4 Emirati men, one of whom was already a known rapist and murderer, gang raped and then brutally murdered an Ethiopian housemaid, smashing her skull into pieces, and they were released after paying just over $10k each. Because the Ethiopian family were practically forced into accepting the blood money, none of them received their sentence.
This was the "Al Dhaid murder", I strongly insist people look it up because it's even worse than you think. Here's one link to the story, but only a partial coverage: http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/courts/...oney-1.1410497
Now, how many people heard about this? Not one international news media covered this case. Not one! It happened when I was an expat in the Gulf, and no international news gave a **** about it. In any case I'm never going back to these countries again even if they quadruple my salary.
Ultimately, in the GCC countries, if a woman gets raped it's her fault. Many Westerners do not realize how fundamentally different their values are and why they believe it is the woman's fault. Even many policemen, judges and courts, when punishing a raped woman, state that the victim "seduced" or "lured" them and thus deserve their punishment. This is what Westerners fundamentally do not understand about the niqab / abaya that Gulf women wear; they think it's about "modesty" or "culture" because they are viewing it from the Western point of view. Wrong; the reason they wear it is simple; because if they didn't, anything that would happen to them would be their fault and their tribe or community would blame them rather than the attacker. The abaya is not for "modesty", it is to stop themselves getting raped.


EDIT:
Another very recent story which deserves to be told so I'll add it in here, since it was barely covered in the media. In case anyone still believes that it's just random primitive criminals engaging in this behavior, the highest levels of Gulf Arab governments engage in this too e.g. the repeated mass gang-rape of two women by over 20 Saudi diplomats http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/i...w/48940210.cms http://www.reuters.com/article/india...0RH2A820150917
Basically, a Saudi diplomat, called Majed Hassan Ashoor, who lives in Jeddah, enslaved 2 Nepali housmaids when posted as a diplomat in India and along with over 22 of his Saudi diplomat friends (with diplomatic immunity), they raped, gang-raped, sodomized and sexually tortured 2 Nepali maids every day for over 4 months, ending September 2015. The maids said that sometimes, 7-8 Saudi diplomats raped them at the same, they anally raped them and they even tortured the maids for their own sexual gratification and they had injuries all over their body. Mr Majed Hassan Ashoor passed the maids around to over 20 of his friends who repeatedly gang-raped them. If you think that's bad enough, all of this happened with the consent of his wife and his daughter, Roza Ashoor, who knew what was going on. The wife of the Saudi diplomat also tortured and beat the maids, forced them to work 20 hour days and starved them and forced them to feed off scraps. Basically this enormous gang-rape racket happened with the consent of his family. The only reason this was found out was because Mr Ashoor tried to enslave a third maid, who managed to escape and notified the Indian police. When the Saudi diplomat was exposed, the Saudi embassy spent the next few days berating the indian police for violating diplomatic immunity. The diplomat seemed to think he did nothing wrong since he "bought" the Nepali maids (thinking they were slaves) and that he could do anything thanks to his diplomatic immunity, and that the police were at fault for daring to rescue the slaves. These 2 Nepali maids went abroad to find work after their homes and livelihoods were destroyed by the Nepali earthquake and then their lives were destroyed by the gang of Saudis. This gang of Saudi diplomats will never be punished and Mr Majed Hassan Ashoor, is living freely in Jeddah today and will never be punished for his heinous crimes. In fact, you can guarantee that back home, he has simply got two new maids and is just repeating the same thing in Saudi Arabia, except now nothing can be done. </TEXT>

Hannibal Lecter:
Killing must feel good to God, too. He does it all the time, and are we not created in God's image?

Will Graham:
Depends on who you ask.

Hannibal Lecter:
God's terrific. He dropped a church roof on 34 of his worshipers last Wednesday night in Texas, while they sang a hymn.

Will Graham:
Did God feel good about that?

Hannibal Lecter:
He felt powerful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is equally brilliant in respects with family and business. The premise is very well conceived and overall fulfilling. This may be the show to look out for to make it through the long stretch. High production values, brilliantly realized and meticulously detailed...intriguing characters that are unique and well written...fantastic cast all structured in a solid engrossing narrative. The integration of modern music gives it a very other dimensional feel that is richer and has more urgency than that of other period pieces which often come off as caricatures of themselves (cough- boardwalk empire). Authentic and powerful, </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I just finished binge watching the whole series and I felt close empathy and  identified with his character throughout the series, except with his relation with Megan, I think he was at fault for creating a wedge between them, first by going against his word to move, and I cant' help but notice he was grumpy all of the time. Which made her fall in love with him less and less every time.
