<TEXT> The blog post mentions the following:

 In addition, many industry partners will be debuting their Street View ready hardware and desktop applications this week at our Street View Summit in Tokyo, Japan.

Seems like this was just posted to let people know about the new street view opportunity and upcoming hardware releases.

<TEXT> It won't be available immediately. Newegg is the only one mentioning that. B H, Best Buy, and even the Asus website just mention marshmallow.

[9to5Google](https://9to5google.com/2017/05/09/asus-zenfone-3-zoom-now-available/) mentions the following:

 Out of the box, the ZenFone 3 Zoom offers Android Marshmallow, which is disappointing, but ASUS has promised an update down the road to Android Nougat.

That is likely what Newegg is referring to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Snapdragon variant should be alright for that. At the moment, it's really tough to say how Samsung will be treating the unlocked S8 when it comes to updates. They could reverse course and keep it on the same update schedule as the carrier variants or it could be the same situation as before with them lagging behind.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on what you're looking for. Some opt for the international models to get the Exynos processor and because it's better for custom software development. With the U.S. unlocked models, you're guaranteed to have all the necessary network bands to work on GSM and CDMA carriers. The international one will only work on GSM and I haven't checked to see if it has all the necessary LTE bands for ATT or T-Mo.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  An exclusive source has shared with us a render of the T-Mobile REVVL T1, which is expected to be the first of at least three devices launched by T-Mobile. The others are the REVVL T2 and REVVL T3 PRO and while we dont have specs for the T2 or T3 Pro, were guessing the T1 will be the most affordable of the three devices

* T-Mobile REVVL T1: midrange device, 5.5-inch 1080p IPS display, a 3,000mAh battery and a fingerprint sensor. 13MP rear camera w/ a front-facing 5MP selfie camera that also has a flash and captures wide-angle images. T-Mobile REVVL series runs Android Nougat out of the box, but expected bloatware aside, its unknown if itll be a heavily skinned interface.

* The T-Mobile REVVL T1 is set to be an ODM device thats manufactured by Alcatels parent company TCL,  </TEXT>

Also, the dev has other LG V20 themes available (paid) that have positive reviews. Keep in mind that something like this wouldn't have many installs to begin with since the V20 isn't as popular as more mainstream phones and even fewer people with the device are looking to buy a theme for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm just going off the forum post. It's the first time I've come across this and the Nvidia employee who made the post stated "new." 

Edit: AP mentions [here](http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/05/03/nvidia-launches-shield-preview-program-let-test-new-software-released/) that there was such a program last year, but it was closed down. The author does mention that "this one seems to be more publicized and tailored for regular users who'd like to participate in beta tests and give their feedback regarding new features." That "more publicized" part is likely why I never came across it before. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Larger displays sell better 

According to [IDC](http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS42334717)

 "Despite the moderate 2.5% growth in 2016, phablets displayed 49% year-over-year growth as consumers continue to flock to big-screened devices in both emerging and developed markets," said Anthony Scarsella, research manager with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker. "Phablets will undoubtedly be the main force driving the market forward thanks to an abundance of feature-rich devices in both the premium and entry-level segments. Total phablet shipments worldwide are expected to reach just under 680 million units by 2021, resulting in a compound annual growth rate of 9.2% for 20162021. In comparison, regular smartphones will grow at a rate of just 1.1% during the same period, proving perhaps that bigger may be better, or at least more popular when it comes to smartphones."

<TEXT>  However from a practical perspective, the composition unit is likely where most users will see or feel the real differences. Responsible for compositing and scaling the different layers within a UI, ARM has consistently been buffing up their composition capabilities over the years to handle Androids increasingly complex UI and features. The Cetus display processor can now composite 8 layers  up from 7 on the previous-generation processors  and with 4 scaling engines, can scale up to 4 of those layers.

 This is especially significant for Android 7, which introduced multiple/side-by-side window modes, and each of which requires its own layer. Combined with any special layering effects on a given window (e.g. window animations), and a multi-window setup can easily eat up layers, not to mention pixels as well in the case of a high resolution tablet.

<TEXT>  Onkyo Corp. completed a string of announcements this week that it is now delivering firmware updates that bring support for Chromecast streaming services to key wireless speakers and AV receivers across its stable of home theater audio brands   Onkyo, Integra and Pioneer.

The list of models getting the update is provided in the article.

 The firmware update adds support for the Google Home, and audio devices featuring the forthcoming Google Assistant. Users can ask Google Home to find music from supported streaming services and play it back through their Integra component. Operations such as volume adjustment and song selection can also be performed using voice commands. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the [press release](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170427007040/en/Nintendo-Launch-Nintendo-2DS-XL-Portable-System) 

 The new system will be available in a stylish black/turquoise color, and will use the same size large screen found on New Nintendo 3DS XL systems. As the name of the new system implies, visuals will be displayed in 2D only. The system is lighter but still packs the same power as New Nintendo 3DS XL, and has built-in NFC support for amiibo cards and figures. It can play the massive library of quality Nintendo 3DS, New Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo DS games in 2D. Nintendo systems are also the only dedicated video game systems where people can find their favorite characters and game franchises, such as Mario, Peach, Yoshi, Kirby, Pokmon, Fire Emblem, Mario Kart, Super Smash Bros., Animal Crossing and The Legend of Zelda. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The issue with a universal smartwatch operating system as it currently stands is that manufacturers just have too hard a time distinguishing themselves. I try on a lot of different smartwatches, and its pretty tough to tell one from the next. Even after a couple of years on the market, manufacturers are still facing an uphill battle convincing mainstream consumers that they need such a device in their life. When you add a device with few distinguishing characteristics in the mix, the fight to stand out becomes that much more difficult.

<TEXT> Pretty barebones when it comes to details

 Magenta is set to offer its own device as well as redefine how you pay for your device plan each month. While we dont have a lot of information about the device itself, we know its going to be a value-based proposition, designed to offer the hot new features of a $650-$850 flagship phone at a much more affordable price.

 Whats the next Uncarrier plan all about we hear you ask? Were not able to reveal everything about this plan but its likely to be commitment free with lifetime warranty and insurance included. So if youve broken your phone, want a new one or have had enough and just want to return it, T-Mobiles plan will have you covered.

Expected timeline for the new plan is rumored to be Q3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> From [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/27/15442994/google-assistant-sdk-smart-speaker-actions-gadgets-raspberry-pi):

 I asked Google what the terms of use would be, and the answer from Chris Ramsdale, a product manager for Google Assistant, is unsurprising. If you want to use the Assistant on an Android device, youll end up following the same process phone makers go through. Commercial terms for other types of devices will roll out over the coming year.

 Ramsdales notes that Developers do not currently have to pay a licensing fee to embed the Google Assistant. He characterized todays announcement as a developer preview ... focused prototyping and evaluating. Google points out one company made a fun mocktails mixer (Okay Google, talk to Mocktails and let me pretend to get hammered.).

<TEXT> For the privacy-minded, the following is noted in the beginning:

 Everything discussed here is opt-in and the features will not work if users do not select a photo of themselves, and that means nothing can happen accidentally or without granting permission. Furthermore, most of the features are only slightly modified versions of existing aspects of the app and pose no additional risk to privacy. I'll leave it up to each reader to determine how they feel about the remaining functions and their practical implications. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  **Edit text more easily**

 Besides new languages, Gboard now comes with a new text editing mode with buttons for easy cursor control and the ability to select text, cut, copy, and paste right from your keyboard. To access this feature, select the Text Editing icon in the quick features menu by pressing on the G button (or arrow) in the suggestion strip. Pro tip: if youre trying to up your typing speed, you can also move the cursor by sliding your finger back and forth along the spacebar, or delete by swiping to the left from the delete key.


 **New customization options: resize and reposition your keyboard**

 Now you can resize the keyboard and move it to a position that feels the most comfortable for you. In the quick features menu (press on arrow or G in the suggestion strip), click More (the three-dots icon), and click the one-handed mode button, then you can adjust the size and position of the keyboard.

<TEXT> Conclusion:

 The S8 doesnt have any clear photographic advantage over the Pixel. Maybe it will if it ever finds a way to use Bixby for more than just shopping or AR for more than just face filters. Right now, though, the Pixel simply captures better photos more often than the rest. It produces richer detail across the entire image, and it does this regardless of lighting.

 I was also pleasantly surprised by the LG G6. I think LG applies more aggressive post-processing to its images than the competition, but its not so aggressive that Id hate the images I was getting out of my G6. 

 What surprised me the most is how the iPhone now feels a generation behind. It was harder to see last year when we pit the iPhone 7 against the Pixel and the less capable S7. But the S8, along with the Pixel and the G6, illuminates the extent to which Apple has fallen behind.

<TEXT>  To help you perfect your kitchen skills, were introducing the ability to cook with the Google Assistant on Google Home.

 Thanks to Bon Appetit, The New York Times, Food Network and more, youll be able to follow step-by-step cooking instructions for more than 5 million recipes.

They note that it will be rolling out over the coming week.



Step 1: Pick a recipe! Go to the Google Assistant on your Android phone or to Google Search (iOS or Android) and find a recipe. Once you pick your favorite, select the Send to Google Home button. Whether youre at home or on the go, your recipe will be saved.

Step 2: Once youre ready to cook, just say Ok Google, start cooking" or "Ok Google, start recipe."

Step 3: And, for those times when youre not sure if you missed a step or just need to repeat the directions, say Ok Google, repeat or Ok Google, whats step two?

Step 4: While you stir and taste test, you can also continue to get things done with your Google Assistant on Google Home. All while youre following the recipe, you can play your favorite music, ask about conversions (teaspoons to tablespoons, tablespoons to cups -- who can remember that stuff?) and set a timer or two. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  today were taking the next step toward continuing to surface more high-quality content from the web. This includes improvements in Search ranking, easier ways for people to provide direct feedback, and greater transparency around how Search works.

* **Search Ranking**: To limit the spread of offensive or inaccurate search results, Google recently updated its Search Quality Rater Guidelines, which human evaluators use to gauge the quality of search results. The updated guidelines provide clearer examples of low-quality results, including misleading information, unexpected offensive results, hoaxes and unsupported conspiracy theories, engineering VP Ben Gomes wrote in the blog post. Google has also tweaked its algorithms to prioritize authoritative results. (from [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15418490/google-search-snippets-changes-fake-news-offensive-results))

* **Direct Feedback Tools**: Starting today, were making it much easier for people to directly flag content that appears in both Autocomplete predictions and Featured Snippets. These new feedback mechanisms include clearly labeled categories so you can inform us directly if you find sensitive or unhelpful content. 

* **Greater transparency about our products**: Now were publishing this policy to the [Help Center](https://support.google.com/websearch/?p=blog_autocomplete_policies) so anyone can learn more about Autocomplete and our approach to removals.  
For those looking to delve a little deeper, we recently updated our [How Search Works site](https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/) to provide more information to users and website owners about the technology behind Search. The site includes a description of how Google ranking systems sort through hundreds of billions of pages to return your results, as well as an overview of our user testing process.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The supply constraint is blamed on the [lack of oled panels](http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/10/15242986/google-oled-screen-pixel-phone-android-investment):

 According to the Electronic Times (via Reuters), the lack of a steady supply of OLED panels was one of the main reasons why Google has had such a hard time shipping the current Pixel phone.

As I stated, Google likely saw this becoming an issue. When the mainly oled supplier is Samsung, there's nothing HTC can do to ramp up production.

<TEXT> If Google is having supply issues in the U.S. supplying just the Google Store (Fi too) and Verizon, I can only imagine how much worse it would be had it been available through other carriers. I still think this is a reason why Google only partnered with one carrier for the Pixels. They likely foresaw that they'd have stock problems. </TEXT>

That is pretty much it. I find it a bit fun hunting app deals before they show up in that app. As I stated in another comment here, It's also why I tend to avoid posting app sales that have shown up in the AppSales app. It kills the fun of finding the deal :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The difference though is that Apple already had a recognizable brand in place from the start of the first iPhone. If the carriers wanted the iPhone, they had to play by Apple's rules. On the Android side of things, every manufacturer started off building phones with brands that didn't have the same prestige. As a result, the U.S. carriers have been able to push them around in order for them to access their network of carrier customers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't seen many Type A (male) to Type C adapters. I came across [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RG8180TYKYFEX/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8 ASIN=B01ABTHI7C) and Benson Leung had the following to say (emphasis mine):

 "USB Type-C receptacle to USB legacy adapters are explicitly not defined or allowed. Such adapters would allow many invalid and potentially unsafe cable connections to be constructed by users."

 This is because if you combine this adapter with a USB Type-A to Type-C cable, you may create a dangerous condition where two power supplies may be connected together opposing each other using the combined cable

 Long story short : This adapter is a type forbidden by the USB Type-C specification, and should NOT exist. It gets my lowest rating of 1-star because **there is no simple thing that the manufacturer can do to make this adapter correct**. As a consumer, DO NOT buy this cable to convert your USB-A chargers or USB-A hub or host ports

Also, I'm sure it comes down to cost as well for Samsung. With the Note 7 situation, it likely resulted in a large amount of type A Fast Chargers sitting around. Instead of disposing them, they probably saw better use pushing the same charger configuration from last year's models. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a consumer friendly move. Shipping with only a C-C cable would limit the accessories people could use. Old chargers sitting around? They would no longer be compatible. Also, Type C to A cables are the ones that tend to have issues with device damage (think Benson Leung). Having that type of cable already in the box ensures that people will at least have one safe cable to charge their S8/S8+.

 This is quite disappointing, as I was hoping that the S8's switch to USB Type-C would spur the movement away from USB Type-A in wall chargers, portable battery packs, laptops, etc.

Type-A will still be around for quite a while. As nice as Type C is, there's no need to rush the change. </TEXT>

 Coming soon, consumers in the U.S. will be able to use PayPal in Android Pay at retailers from Walgreens to Dunkin' Donuts.

 Initially, users will be able to pay using their PayPal balance and over the coming months we will add the ability to use cards that have been stored with PayPal, enabled by our recent tokenization partnerships with major card networks

 The PayPal integration with Android Pay is supported on versions of Android OS 4.4 and higher, including KitKat, Lollipop, Marshmallow and Nougat.

<TEXT>  Here are a few applications that could be facilitated by Snapdragon 835 on-device machine learning tech:

* Photography: Machine learning can aid in scene classification, real-time noise reduction, and object tracking, making it easier to take the perfect shot, or capture video regardless of the conditions.

* VR/AR: With machine learning on your device, VR/AR feature can operate faster and with less lag, so everything from gestures and facial recognition to object tracking and depth perception are an immersive experience.

* Voice detection: Your phones on-device AI can listen for commands and keywords to help you navigate the data and apps on your device more efficiently, and save power doing so.

* Security: With facial recognition software and iris scanning, all operating independently from the cloud, your device can learn to identify, and help protect, you.

* Connections: Your Snapdragon device has the ability to filter out distracting background noise during calls for clearer conversations with friends and family. </TEXT>

 If you insist on inserting yourself or family members into the happy tourist snap, that shouldn't be too much of an imposition, either: just take a bunch of selfies in advance and the software will stitch the two images together for you.

So he notes you can take a picture without needing to use a camera, but here he's recommending you take selfies in  advance (with an actual lens?) in order to get around this tech not being able to capture people as they actually are in the moment. Sorry, but I don't want an image of myself from a totally different day to be inserted into a rather unique shot.  </TEXT>

 Im not a man who wears watches, and Ive never been optimistic about this market. In fact, Ive never figured out why we need to wear smartwatches when everything we need is on our phones.

This is why smartwatches have yet to interest me. There are those who do find benefits in a smartwatch, but in their current state, a smartphone is always the first thing I reach for.

**Edit** for clarification since I keep seeing this brought up: I used a smartwatch (Moto 360 Sport) for a month. Found no need to keep using it afterwards. As I already stated, I'm not saying they're pointless since some people do find them beneficial, but it just didn't work for me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  In a future version of Android, apps targeting Android O will see Build.SERIAL as "UNKNOWN".

Too early to get the Android P train rolling? 


The change below looks like a response to the security issues brought up in this [ARS Technica article](https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/03/shielding-mac-addresses-from-stalkers-is-hard-android-is-failing-miserably/)

 We collaborated with security researchers to design robust MAC address randomization for Wi-Fi scan traffic produced by the chipset firmware in Google Pixel and Nexus 5X devices. The Android Connectivity team then worked with manufacturers to update the Wi-Fi chipset firmware used by these devices. 

 **Android O integrates these firmware changes into the Android Wi-Fi stack, so that devices using these chipsets with updated firmware and running Android O or above can take advantage of them.**

 Here are some of the changes that we've made to Pixel, Pixel XL and Nexus 5x firmware when running O+: 

 * For each Wi-Fi scan, the phone uses a new random MAC address.
 * The initial packet sequence number for each scan is also randomized.
 * MAC addresses are randomized for all Wi-Fi scans while the device is disconnected from an access point (whether or not the device is in standby).
 * Unnecessary Probe Request Information Elements have been removed: Information Elements are limited to the SSID and DS parameter sets.

<TEXT>  In my years of reviewing devices, no other smartphone has ever been able to last through my demanding workday like the Z Play can.

The Z Play is a beast in the battery department. Definitely the best battery life I've ever experienced on a phone and it still had many other positive points. Out of all the devices I went through last year, it's one of the ones I miss the most. It'll be interesting to see how Moto follows it up this year.

 . . . but each time Ive switched my SIM into another phone, it ended up back in my Z Play after less than a day. I hope that in the future other device makers will prioritize battery life the way that Moto did here, without compromising the rest of the features that make my smartphone such an indispensable tool. Until then, Ill be sticking with my Z Play.

Damn good endorsement for the Z Play from Dan Seifert. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  We usually complain about the plateauing of smartphone improvements, which are now coming at a slower pace and in more incremental ways  but the upside of that deceleration is that you can pick up yesteryears flagship phone and still feel like youre riding in the premium smartphone carriage. And thats nice.

Very nice indeed. For those in the market for a new phone and want great value for the money, discounted flagships from last year will still provide a great experience. </TEXT>

Interesting. Google sourced their amoled displays for the current Pixels from Samsung. With the recent news that Apple reached a deal with Samsung to supply OLED panels for the next iPhones, it looks like Google was pushed aside and forced to look for another supplier. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 2017 devices singled out:

* Sony Xperia XZs/XZ Premium (U.S. fingerprint situation)
* LG G6 (wireless charging and quad dac variants)
* Galaxy S8/S8+ (128GB storage w/ 6GB RAM variant)

The people making these business decisions must have valid reasons for releasing unique market variants, but as a consumer, it kinda sucks knowing there's another model out there of the same phone that would be better suited for my usage. At the same time, I also understand it's mainly an enthusiast problem since regular consumers (in the U.S. at least) likely don't know that there's a G6 model out there with better audio capabilities or an S8 with more storage and ram. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some sections from the article:

 On Thursday, Microsoft added a few details via two emails to Computerworld, saying that the pre-orders apply to S8 and S8+ devices running on the AT T network. Unlocked devices that will work with any carrier are coming "in the future," a spokeswoman added.

 The potential to buy unlocked phones with Windows apps is significant, analysts said, given the 20% or greater savings enterprises can achieve with unlocked smartphones that don't require a service contract. 

 Business users may come out winners in the Samsung-Microsoft arrangement, while both companies expect to benefit as well, analysts said.

 Galaxy S8 customers using the loaded Microsoft productivity apps stand to gain access to Microsoft Azure cloud services, productivity software with Office 365 and enterprise workflow with SharePoint, said Gartner analyst Werner Goertz.

 With the new DeX docking station that Samsung announced alongside its new phones, workers could dock a new S8 and run Windows apps on large displays and a full-size keyboard and mouse. And "think about the [many] use cases that DeX [docking station and large screen] will open up for Samsung in the workplace," Goertz said.

Personal preference thing, but as someone who has had wireless charging capable phones in the past, I'd take an upgraded audio experience over wireless charging any day. Even with Samsung's fast wireless charging, I've always had a preference towards plugging the phone into a quick charging brick. That said, when it comes to sales, there's more money to be made selling wireless charging pads. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As noted in the article, it's similar to what LG did with the G Flex, but it's at least few years away from getting into consumer hands:

 Some LG phones, like the G Flex, already include a similar material on its back covers that can heal scratches. But this material can't conduct electricity, so manufacturers can't use it for screens. Most phone screens have a grid of electrodes underneath, and when you touch it, your finger (which is also conductive) completes a circuit, telling the phone what to do.

 Wang predicts that this new self-healing material will be used for phone screens and batteries by 2020. </TEXT>

 But who actually likes April Fools Day? Well, theres always that one guy  And its usually a guy, for some reason, Boese says  who considers himself a prankster, and waits all year for the holiday. (The rest of us, of course, do not require the excuse of a holiday in order to make a joke.) **So maybe most of us hate April Fools Day, but the people who like it really like it.** Sadly, the dumb pranks will continue for the foreseeable future. </TEXT>

If you have a bit more time, podcasts also cover good info around the time reviews start coming out. Some tend to go beyond the reviews they posted and add extra tidbits when discussing it. The following ones are a few I listen to: All About Android, Mobile Tech Roundup, Android Authority, Android Central, Android Police, Mobile Roar, Pocketnow Weekly, and Droid Life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [imgur mirror](http://imgur.com/a/sExUe) (26 images in this album, all from WinFuture.de). The album also contains all 4 colors for the S8/S8+.

Screenshot of the [spec table comparing the S8 to the S7](http://i.imgur.com/8DZ84yM.png)

Some quotes from the article (emphasis mine):

 **The new Galaxy S8 models have stereo speakers**

 Although Samsung mainly uses the iris scanner for user registration, the fingerprint reader is still on board, even if it now sits sideways to the rear camera. **It can also be used with some gestures to open or close apps.**

 The devices actually get 5.8 and 6.2 inch screens with an aspect ratio of 18.5: 9, where the resolution of the Super-Amoled panel used here is equal to 2,960 x 1,440 pixels on both models. **The display is even more stretched than the LG G6**

 In some countries, Samsung offers the S8 models, as before, **a program called "Samsung Guard S8"**, which can be repaired within two hours and extend the warranty by another year. In addition, a one-time free replacement of the display will be possible and the option of "remote support" is available on the devices themselves

  Samsung installed on the back again a single 12-megapixel sensor, whose sensor pixels are 1.4 micrometers large. The camera also has an F/1.7 aperture and combines a phase detection and a laser autofocus, although there will probably be an optical image stabilizer again - but we can not confirm that yet.

 On the front of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus is not only an 8-megapixel camera , which also has an F/1.7 aperture, but also has an autofocus. This should help "to capture highly dynamic situations". Something more interesting, however, is that Samsung's new flagship again installed an iris scanner, which is intended to identify the user quickly, easily and reliably.

 The battery of the Samsung Galaxy S8 is **3000 mAh**. With the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus it is probably **3500 mAh**, whereby in this case confirmation is still pending </TEXT>

<TEXT> Definitely an interesting read. 

 Sometimes teams at X set out to build one thing, only to discover that the technologies they create have applications far beyond the initial problem they were trying to solve. This was certainly the case for Gcam, the computational photography project that now powers the acclaimed Google Pixel camera, as well as a range of other image processing products across Alphabet.

 Most recently, Gcams HDR+ technology launched as the default mode for the critically acclaimed Google Pixel phone. DxOMark, the industry standard for camera ratings, declared that the Pixel camera was the best smartphone camera ever made in 2016. Reflecting on the evolution of the project, Marc says, It took five years to get it really rightand were grateful that X gave our team the long-term horizons and independence to make that happen.

<TEXT> I looked around for some more info since this hasn't really ever crossed my mind. The one exception appears to be Meizu, since they have launched some phones with Exynos processors. However, it may not have been a big deal to Qualcomm considering Meizu's main market is China and apparently [90% of their devices](https://gearburn.com/2017/03/meizu-qualcomm-phones/) utilize MediaTek. 

Moving forward, it'll be interesting to see how Exynos plays a role in Meizu's lineup since in late December it was [announced that Meizu agreed to pay Qualcomm licensing fees](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-30/qualcomm-to-gain-fees-from-china-s-meizu-in-lawsuit-settlement-ixbd1ikq) and because the first article I linked to mentioned the following:

<TEXT> I'm enjoying it, though I still prefer Android. In regards to other flagships, the main thing I like about the iPhone is the consistent battery life. Unlike with some other phones, I've never had a day where the battery life unexpectedly took a dive. The camera is great, but the same can be said for many of the flagships from 2016. In comparison to other dual camera phones, I slightly prefer the wide angle lens incorporated into the V20 rather than the telephoto lens in the 7 Plus. Moving onto the screen, I prefer Samsung's amoled panels, but the iPhone's display is still great to look at. I'm not a pixel peeper so having it be a FHD panel rather than a QHD doesn't bother me. 

I'll stop there because this could get longer if I keep on going. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. 

Just to add: I never owned the Pixel/Pixel XL, but out of the 2016 flagships I've had, my favorite still has to be the Note 7. </TEXT>

#Potential good news: 
On the back of the box it states A3LSMG955U. As reported by [Droid Life](http://www.droid-life.com/2017/03/08/unlocked-galaxy-s8-plus-s8-fcc-smg950-smg955/), this is the unlocked U.S. version. If this is being sold with a Verizon box, it could mean the U.S. could just see one model instead of the typical carrier variants.

With the first setting, you just drag your finger around to manipulate the shape of the face. The movements are pretty limited, but the result is evident in the second photo. The next three settings are just sliders that you adjust to your liking. I went to the extreme with all three just to show it in action. I'm not proud of the end result :( </TEXT>

<TEXT>  **Immersive full screen for PWAs**

When Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are launched from the Android Home screen, they launch in a standalone app-like mode that hides the omnibox. This helps create an engaging user experience, and frees up screen space for content. However, for even more immersive experiences like games, video players, or other rich content, other mobile UI elements such as the system bars can still be a distraction.
 Now PWAs can provide a fully immersive experience by setting display: fullscreen in their web app manifest, which hides non-app UI when the site is launched from the home screen.

<TEXT> I searched beforehand for each app individually and only noticed 4 apps of theirs directly posted here. However, after seeing your comment, I searched "HDM" and noticed [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/googleplaydeals/comments/606zrm/apps_some_utilities_like_cleanup_blue_screen/). Seems like I missed it since the apps weren't listed by name and the blue light one was incorrectly titled "blue screen." Thanks for the heads up. I'll just delete this post.

Edit: Just noticed that other one is the 10th post down when the sub is organized by "new." I'm an idiot. lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> It pretty much comes down to how much you value your privacy. Some want to be as secure as possible and prefer not to be tracked online for certain reasons. For them, it doesn't matter if they're simply browsing, torrenting, or doing confidential stuff. Others, like yourself, prefer the convenience VPNs offer by being able to access certain sites blocked by some countries. In that situation, you're not really concerned about privacy.

However, keep in mind that the following is mentioned in the article:

 But a shady or poorly configured service could compromise your traffic, either by design or by accident, or could even piggyback on your encrypted connection for nefarious purposes.

 "Your data could be intercepted or decrypted," said Mat Gangwer, chief technology officer with Rook Security in Indianapolis. "Bad guys could be using your connection for shady activities or to cover their tracks."

You may not be doing confidential things, like online banking, but a compromised VPN could still have a negative impact. It won't always happen, but the possibility is there. </TEXT>

Yep. I'm a former Moto Z Play owner and that device treated me well. It won't be a top dog when it comes to benchmarks, but in daily usage, it performed as well as any flagship phone I've owned.

<TEXT>  What happened here sounds bizarre, but it's actually all of the individual pieces of this charging system working as designed. The battery backup charged my phone until it was drained, and then started pulling power back from the phone because it was drained. USB-C is designed to allow simple power sharing, so anything can charge anything else. In theory it's amazing, and has seriously come in handy when I needed 20 more minutes of juice on my Chromebook for work and only had a phone nearby. In this situation, though, it didn't work out the way I wanted it to.

This has never crossed my mind since I rarely let my battery packs fall below 50%. I'd definitely be upset if I woke up to something like this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> True, and I wouldn't be surprised if the mods remove it for that reason, but it still has the ability to benefit mobile users as mentioned below (emphasis mine):

 It is our hope that webmasters and graphic designers will find Guetzli useful and apply it to their photographic content, making users experience smoother on image-heavy websites **in addition to reducing load times and bandwidth costs for mobile users.** Last, we hope that the new explicitly psychovisual approach in Guetzli will inspire further image and video compression research.

Ultimately, there could be benefits to Android in the form of incorporating the feature into the OS as it gets further developed. In addition to the above-mentioned benefits, it could reduce the size of pictures and videos taken by our phones without negatively impacting quality. </TEXT>

 When your kid turns 13, they have the option to graduate to a normal Google Account. Before a kid turns 13, parents will get an email letting them know their kid will be eligible to take charge of their account on their birthday, so you can no longer manage their account. On the day they turn 13, kids can choose whether they want to manage their own Google Account or continue to have their parent manage it for them.

If they choose to stay after 13, it seems like the same parental controls are carried over. </TEXT>

 According to this quick pic of some Verizon internal materials, pre-orders start Friday, March 17 for the LG G6. It appears that everyone who pre-orders gets the free Google Home LG is offering, while folks upgrading on an existing plan will also get a $200 trade-in for select devices. If you're coming to Verizon as a new customer (or opening a new line) they have a sweet 43-inch LG TV for you, too. These promos also stack with Verizon's $650 Switcher offer if you're coming from another carrier and the FIOS $500 bundle promo for new customers. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  We've decided to add support for Java 8 language features directly into the current javac and dx set of tools, and deprecate the Jack toolchain. With this new direction, existing tools and plugins dependent on the Java class file format should continue to work. Moving forward, Java 8 language features will be natively supported by the Android build system. We're aiming to launch this as part of Android Studio in the coming weeks, and we wanted to share this decision early with you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since the dev is based in China, I wouldn't be surprised if they used [the same excuse as Meitu](https://www.cnet.com/news/meitu-denies-selling-collected-user-data-blames-china-for-data-collection-workarounds/). 

For those that don't want to click:

 Meitu told CNET in a statement that the data collection code was included because the company is headquartered in China, where tracking services provided by app stores such as the Apple App Store and Google Play are blocked.

 "To get around this, Meitu employs a combination of third-party and in-house data tracking systems to make sure the user data tracked is consistent," said a Meitu spokesperson.

 The check also ensures that ads are tracked properly, as well as for protection against illegal API usage, said Meitu's spokesperson. MAC addresses and IMEI numbers are also combined into a unique ID for internal tracking purposes.

<TEXT> Not necessarily. A hardware revision means they changed something about the design, like they did when adding the small nubs to the back of the Nexus 4. In the Pixel's case, it seems like they solely focused on the manufacturing aspect, without changing any of the components within the phone. I assume this could be something like tweaking the machinery, revising some processes, and improving quality control. 

Also, they could have done a revision, but are spinning it a bit to make it seem like it's not a bit change in order to avoid upsetting current owners. That said, hardware revisions are nothing new when it comes to consumer electronics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unconfirmed, but below is the reason given:

 The optical fingerprint recognition technology is still nascent and the report claims that Samsung and its fingerprint sensor supplier Synaptics were running out of time. Even though Samsung poured resources into Synaptics nascent technology last year, the results were frustrating.

 The company had to make a decision as it had to start mass production of the Galaxy S8. It made a last minute decision to relocate the fingerprint sensor to the back. Samsung reportedly tried its best to have an embedded fingerprint sensor in the Galaxy S8s display but Synaptics was unable to develop the technology on time. </TEXT>

Additionally, for the longest time, the unlocked U.S. G5 was stuck on the July security patch. However, it finally got a security patch update in January.

<TEXT> [3C image link found via Weibo](http://i.imgur.com/i4dQzS1.jpg).

Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charging is pretty much the same as QC 2.0. As [AC noted last year](http://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-s7-and-s7-edge-only-support-quick-charge-20-coming-short-latest-standard), they're probably going this route due to the phone shipping with two different processors. Also, given the Note 7 situation, adopting a faster charging standard likely wasn't a priority.

Edit: just noticed that unfortunate title error :( </TEXT>

 Privacy Shade will let you read emails, messages and personal content at any time without worrying about snoopers, even if someone is looking over your shoulder. The app allows you to view private information in public places  like on the train or in a restaurant  by obscuring the parts of the screen that youre not actively viewing or using, while still allowing you to interact with the obscured parts.

 Privacy Shade lets you adjust the transparency of the filter to suit the surroundings. Another feature is quick access to Privacy Shade in four ways:

 * If you are using Android OS 7.0 Nougat or higher, you can add BlackBerry Privacy Shade to your Quick Settings.
 * If you are using a BlackBerry device with a Convenience Key, you can assign BlackBerry Privacy Shade to the Convenience Key.
 * If you are using a BlackBerry device that supports Swipe Shortcuts, you make BlackBerry Privacy Shade one of your shortcuts.
 * Regardless of what Android device youre using, you can also toggle BlackBerry Privacy Shade on or off via an optional dedicated notification in the notification tray. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned messaging service used by more than 1 billion people worldwide, is testing a system that would let businesses talk directly to WhatsApp users for the first time, according to communications about the project seen by Reuters.

 One potential revenue source is to charge businesses that want to contact customers on WhatsApp. But the company is working carefully to avoid problems with spam messages, the documents show. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Our brand new Android app lets you instantly see which apps are wasting your data, acting suspiciously, slowing your phones Internet speed, or causing you to go over your carrier data limits. GlassWire for Android makes it easy to keep track of your mobile carrier data usage and WiFi Internet activity.

 Key features:

* See a live graph of what apps are currently using your carrier data, or slowing your Internet connection.
* Instantly know every time a new app accesses the network and begins using your data.
* Go back in time with GlassWires graph to see what apps wasted your data earlier in the week or month.
* GlassWires data alerts help keep you under your data limit. Get alerted before you reach your carrier data limit to avoid costly overage fees.
* GlassWire reveals unusual network activity from unknown apps or malware that could be violating your privacy or spying on you.
* GlassWire counts your mobile carrier data (Edge, 3G, 46, 5G, LTE, CDMA, UMTS, GSM, GPRS, mobile hotspots) and shows you detailed usage statistics on GlassWires Usage screen, along with your WiFi data. See your mobile phone provider data for AT T, Verizon, Sprint, T-mobile, Virgin, Vodafone, Orange, EE, 3, Swisscom, Telia, Movistar, O2, and all others.
* See data usage for different apps like Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, Pokemon Go, Netflix, Youtube, Instagram, Pandora, Spotify, Pinterest, Whatsapp, Skype, Kik, and any other apps you use. </TEXT>

I posted direct links to the the source before this post was submitted. The first post, [seen here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/5xztcb/more_leaked_pictures_of_the_galaxy_s8_and_galaxy/), was removed for "blog spam" even though it's the direct source. After noticing it, I submitted [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/5y054k/slashleaks_even_more_galaxy_s8_and_galaxy_s8/) linking to Slashleaks' twitter post and that was removed by u/gadgetdroid for spam/rehosted content. Since Android Central got these photos from Slashleaks, shouldn't this be considered rehosted content? I would love for a mod to explain this since I have gotten no response through messaging.

Edit: looks like now this post was removed.

<TEXT>  investors shouldn't consider Xiaomi's announcement to be a major blow to Qualcomm on its own. Nonetheless, the overall trend is worrisome, because it indicates that Qualcomm's chipmaking business -- which posted flat year-over-year sales growth last quarter -- will likely continue ceding market share to first-party ARM chips for the foreseeable future.  

It'll be interesting to see how many other manufacturers switch to making their own chips. With TI and NVIDIA having exited the game a while back, I'm all for other manufacturers stepping up to give Qualcomm competition.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The twitter source does state "film+S8." I'm wondering if that means there's a screen protector over the S8 and that is just showing much more cutouts than normal.

For reference, the Note 7 only had 3 noticeable sensor/camera cutouts. However, as [seen here](http://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/article/83785-image/Best-Galaxy-Note-7-plastic-film-and-tempered-glass-screen-protectors.jpg), screen protectors need to provide more cutouts for the other sensors that aren't easy to spot. Something like this has already been shown for the S8, [product seen here](http://static.trustedreviews.com/94/00003ce44/0ad1_orh370w630/s8-case.png). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wonder if the limited carrier release had to do with Google expecting there to be supply issues. If they're having issues keeping them in stock with just Verizon as a carrier partner, I can only imagine the stock issues would've been much worse had it seen distribution through more carriers. Hopefully production supply kinks are straightened out by the time the second gen Pixel gets released.  </TEXT>

 Heres the full text of what we were told:

 You should interpret Budget Pixel as a device that is being developed by the same team working on the Pixel 2, that is aimed at being released in emerging markets. This could mean Android One, this could mean something entirely different. My knowledge of this device is that: a.) its being developed alongside the Pixel 2 and b.) **will not be sold in the US (assuming that it leaves the prototype stages)**.

<TEXT>  Google is undermining MWC debutants simply by having the best mobile camera tech all to itself. Granted, the Pixels distribution and marketing still leave it as a niche device for now, but its acting essentially like an iPhone  dampening enthusiasm for the newest and shiniest Android phones by virtue of its superior technology.

I'm  all for having the best smartphone camera, but Google isn't undermining Android manufacturers by having unique camera software for its hardware. There is still plenty of enthusiasm surrounding new Android hardware releases. Not everyone is going to get the G6, but there's still a group of fans eager to get the phone. Then the even larger Galaxy fan base is enthusiastic for the upcoming S8/S8+. 

When it comes to the top tier flagships, you're going to get a good shooter no matter which option you go with. Would it be nice to have Google's processing on my non-Pixel phone? Yes, but that alone isn't going to sway my buying decisions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Looks like Lenovo plans to introduce its own "AI-powered" service to devices later this.

 Lenovo's coming voice-based service will rely on a personal identifier attached to all users of its hardware, allowing it to work consistently across Lenovo phones, tablets, desktop and laptop computers, said Dery.

 Dery described this as a supplement to the assistants from Amazon and Google. While those two services mostly respond to queries and commands, Lenovo's will send notifications and alerts based on predictions about users' behavior and needs, according to the executive.

 "We don't like to call it an assistant because it's misleading in a way," he said. "This is something which is always aware, in the background, syncing for you."  </TEXT>

The three noted changes:

 In an update to Allo for Android today, Google is placing a button to access the Assistant right in the little box where you type out a message. Previously, you had to type @google in order to call up the Assistant.

 Google is adding two other new features to Allo today. One is the ability to search for GIFs, which you can do by pulling up Allos emoji suggestion box and swiping all the way to the end of it.

 Allo is also getting some giant animated emoji today that spring to life when you enlarge them with the apps shout feature. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Apple does tend to start trends, but I think this is one that won't be widely adopted anytime soon. Plenty of people still rely on headphone jacks, and for those that don't, having a jack there isn't really a nuisance. On the Apple side, people just deal with it since it's an iPhone. Whereas some people shop for a phone that has certain features, such as water resistance or a fingerprint sensor, I have yet to see anyone saying not having a headphone jack is an important selling point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Screenshot of the channels it has](http://i.imgur.com/9h7boWP.png). Also includes regional sports networks and local TV stations.

 For $35 a month, subscribers get all four major networks - ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC - and around 30 of the biggest cable channels. That price covers six accounts, so each member of the household can have a personalized account that offers recommendations tuned to their taste.

 Sadly, like many other streaming bundles, it has gaps. YouTube TV, as its called, will be missing channels from Viacom, including big names like Comedy Central and MTV. It also wont have programming from Turner Broadcasting, meaning you wont be able to get CNN, TBS, and TNT. AMC Networks, Discovery Communications, and A+E Networks are also missing as of the launch announcement.


Other tidbits mentioned by [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/apps/2017/02/28/google-announces-youtube-tv-service-rivals-cable/#.tnw_UUTRh8Pq):

 The service also includes a feature called Cloud DVR, which allows you to save an unlimited number of shows without worrying about the storage limits of a traditional DVR.

 The company also said it was focusing on providing a solid customer service experience, because cable services tend to suck at that. Youll be able to call, email, or chat with customer service right from the YouTube TV app.

 Speaking of the app, its divided into three sections: Library, Home, and Live. The Live section allows you to channel surf, even letting you swipe up and down to switch between channels instantly. To record a show, simply tap on the + icon.

 Meanwhile, the Library tab is meant to help you find your favorite shows as well as your recordings. It also provides show suggestions using machine learning based on your interests and a shows characteristics.

 The first upcoming change is pretty simple, it's just a new button in the task bar that can be used to sort messages. The specifics about the available sorting options aren't available yet, but it's likely there will at least be options to sort by date and by sender name.

 The second item on the list is a bit more interesting. It looks like Inbox is going to offer to intelligently pick the "most important part of [a] message" to show in the brief line of text below the subject and sender in the email list. </TEXT>

NextBit released the Robin with the fingerprint sensor and power button combo in the U.S. without problems. Mesa bringing up the U.S. carriers is still a bit vague. In the end, we still don't know much about the situation since the Sony exec danced around the question. As a result, people will continue to speculate. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  So here's the meat of the issue: based on some deal previously made relating specifically to the U.S., in order for Sony to sell phones in the country it cannot ship them with functioning fingerprint sensors.

 When pressed for specifics, Mesa acknowledged the rub with U.S. carriers in Sony's transition from selling carrier-backed phones to going entirely unlocked, eventually leading to this fingerprint situation in some way.

Gotta love our U.S. carriers... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the info. I guess we'll find out later today, but I wonder if this is another situation like the Priv where AT T gets it first, followed by the other US carriers at some later point. Since it launched a few months after it was first released, that could be why BB never got around to listing VZW's Priv on their site. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Edit: Had a feeling the site went up too early. [Here are screenshots from the front page and the specs](http://imgur.com/a/ihwGG)

Some Specs:

* 4.5" Display: 1620 x 1080 IPS LCD (433 PPI)
* Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 Octa-Core 2.0 GHz w/ 64-bit Adreno 506 GPU
* 3505 mAh battery w/ QC 3.0
* 32GB Storage + microSD card support up to 2TB
* 3GB RAM
* 12MP auto-focus large pixel rear camera: Sony IMX 378 Sensor (same one in the Pixel)
* 8MP front camera with flash
* Android 7.1

Also: Judging by the network bands, the North American model won't support the US CDMA carriers. However, it has all the LTE bands for AT T and T-Mo.

<TEXT> I never said they aren't working on it. It's just that most of the RCS articles written up to this point haven't been positive with regards to AT T, T-Mo, and VZW. However, it could very well be that they're quietly working behind the scenes to implement it and Sprint chose to be the main US carrier doing it publicly.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, [they're partners](http://www.gsma.com/network2020/universal-profile/), but they haven't done much yet to get behind the RCS push. The main US carrier that has been doing this is Sprint. [Here](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160222005526/en/Global-Operators-Google-GSMA-Align-Adoption-Rich), [here](https://9to5google.com/2017/02/01/nope-t-mobile-isnt-rolling-out-support-for-googles-rcs-offering-in-messenger/), and [here](https://thenextweb.com/apps/2017/02/24/how-google-is-trying-to-make-sms-sexy-again/#.tnw_wmKQaQ7B) you can see that AT T, T-Mo, and VZW are still not behind Google's RCS push. Being a partner for the Universal Profile is one thing, but actually working together to get widespread support for the standard is something different. Hopefully that changes soon after Google's re-branding for Android Messages. </TEXT>

 Verizon supports RCS, but not officially in any way that the GSMA feels is compliant. That's not really surprising because this is Verizon we're talking about and they don't like to play nice with anyone until they have to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [LG V20](https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/lg-v20)

[Galaxy S7 Edge](https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge?color=Bluecoral)

[Galaxy S7](https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/samsung-galaxy-s7?color=Goldplatinum)

**Bonus deal for V20 buyers**: LG has a promotion where you can get a free MiniBeam Projector by mail for purchasing the T-Mo V20. [Click here](http://www.lg.com/us/promotions/t-mobile). The purchase must be made by today (Feb. 22) to get this projector offer.

For current post-paid T-Mo customers looking to get either of these phones: You need to sign into your My Tmobile and you will get the option for device payment or one-time full charge of $360 (no $20 sim needed if you're an existing customer). For users who can't upgrade online or are still on JOD, call the 1800-Tmobile number to place your order. They will see the $360 price, but they will charge you a $20 upgrade fee (which they cannot remove).

For non T-Mo users, there doesn't seem to be a way to order the phone without a plan. You can cancel your plan afterwards and just pay off the device balance. If you want to avoid a credit check, you'll have to call T-Mobile. Lastly, if you're interested in using the phone on another carrier, T-Mo requires the line to be active for 40 days before you can unlock it.

<TEXT> Some keypoints:

* The Snapdragon X20 LTE modem will use Samsungs latest 10nm LPE process and offer a few key enhancements over the X16 LTE modem integrated into the Snapdragon 835 SoC
* The X20 allows network operators to deploy gigabit LTE service with only 10MHz of licensed spectrum. This is vitally important in many crowded markets where 20MHz blocks are rare
* Exclusive DSDV feature: With DSDV the second SIM is no longer limited to 2G or 3G voice duties, because voice can be carried over LTE. It also allows the user to select either SIM for LTE data service.
* Like previous Qualcomm LTE modems, the Snapdragon X20 will be offered as a stand-alone product initially, but will likely be integrated into a high-end Snapdragon SoC next year.

it also boasts a peak theoretical bandwith of 1.2 Gbps DL, but I doubt any of us will be seeing that anytime soon.

Towards the end, there's also [this info pertaining to Snapdragon 835 antenna tech](http://i.imgur.com/bblSLf6.jpg). The QAT35xx parts can be used alongside the 835 and those work together to optimize signal quality. </TEXT>

* $45 per line for four lines with unlimited data, talk and text on your smartphones and tablets with paper-free billing and AutoPay.

Looks like it includes HD video streaming, which is obviously better than 480p. It does state the following though:

  To ensure a quality experience for all customers, after 22 GB of data usage on a line during any billing cycle we may prioritize usage behind other customers in the event of network congestion. While we dont expect to do that very often, network management is a crucial tool that benefits all Verizon customers.

<TEXT> They're only in for tough luck when it comes to the enthusiasts that care about the 835 more. Normal consumers make up the majority of buyers and will likely base their buying decisions on anything but the SoC. 

Also, keep in mind that HTC released the U Ultra as a flagship running the 821. Some people may not see it as a flagship, but HTC does. With no leaked launch date for the HTC 11, this could be like LG's G and V series. U Ultra gets released first and the HTC 11 comes out later in the year. </TEXT>

Also, in the VB photo, the opening for the camera sensor is slightly bigger. The opening in this "leak" is exactly the same as the S7. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't gotten around to updating my device flair, but I no longer have it. However, it was a damn good phone. Performance on it never let me down. I'm not a mobile gamer, but for everything else I threw at it, it worked as well as the pricier flagships. Also, the camera performed a lot better than what I expected. Low light photography is where it falls short, but it could still keep up with the much more expensive Z Force and some auto mode shots on it came out better than what the V20 can produce. Battery life is an obvious plus and easily beat out any phone I have owned. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone that is looking to pick one up. Great build quality and some of the Moto Mods, such as the free battery mod I received, do provide added benefits. </TEXT>

The photo came from my phone (LG V20) and my edit attempt is the image I posted. I'm still new to manual shooting and there's obviously a limit to what a phone can do. I did my editing on Lightroom for mobile. I haven't gotten around to understanding all the editing options it offers. I did most of my changes using the app's basic mode. I'm also colorblind so I usually try my best not to overdo it in post-processing, but that doesn't always work out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nice shot! Most of my night photos were with a 30 sec. exposure. I was using a Joby gorillapod and would place it on whatever I could. Depending on where I placed it, it wasn't always the most stable thing. I only noticed star trails starting to form if I slightly bumped the V20 at the beginning. 

You can brighten the image afterwards, but it's better to get a proper exposure while you're shooting rather than doing it in post-processing. As for extra brightness for a 15 sec exposure, all you can tweak is the ISO. However, if your main object is in the foreground and you just want the night sky for a background, you can use a light source to help you. 

[For example, this picture](http://i.imgur.com/T4myfWN.jpg). I placed the gorillapod on the back of a flimsy plastic chair in front of the tree. I had a small flashlight that could only light up a small section of the tree. I set the exposure for 25 sec. Once the V20 began shooting, I got below the tree and moved the flashlight back and forth to light paint most of the tree. Some odd looking star trails can be observed, but I think it had more to do with the phone not being on a really stable surface. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did some reading online, but most of the stuff I've learned so far has come from just playing with the app. Hopefully someone who knows far more than me can chime in.
 
If you don't have a very bright object in view, then you can bump up the exposure to get better night sky photos. In my case, the moon had already set so I didn't have to worry about it and I was in a very small town with minimal street lights. You can then tweak the ISO to get a brighter image. However, as you do this, you might start noticing more noise if you go with too high an ISO. Just so you get familiar with it, I'd start with a long exposure (say 15 sec.) and the lowest ISO. Keep the exposure the same, but increase the ISO for different shots just so you can observe how changing the ISO affects the image. You can do auto-focus, but I'd stick with controlling it manually. I stuck with an auto white balance since I'm colorblind. Thankfully, if you shoot in RAW, you can change the white balance afterwards. However, I've read that changing it manually while shooting leads to a better result rather than relying on editing the RAW file.

Check out the album I linked below showing three shots with exposure times of 10, 20, and 30 sec. I should've changed the ISO, but I kept it the same just to show how only tweaking exposure can lead to stars coming out brighter.

<TEXT> Current V20 owner here. The dual camera setup is great, but LG needs to release a software update to tweak its performance. As an example, one has to be careful when HDR is enabled. In full light, it gets the job done. However, indoors and in low light conditions, if HDR is enabled, say goodbye to your picture quality. It ends up looking over processed and quite odd. I've owned quite a few devices this year and this is the first time I've come across a situation where HDR does this. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Incipio cases for the V20 (Carnaby + NGP) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-22 15:09:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I bought these cases while Incipio was running their sale. Both work great with Skinomi's full coverage screen protector. I'll keep the info basic here since I put more notes in the imgur links below for both cases.

[Incipio Carnaby Esquire Series](http://imgur.com/a/Wvrrs): Nicest looking of the two. Incipio doesn't drop rate this case but it looks like it should provide some good protection. Fits great and all the cutouts are correct. As nice as it is, the MSRP is a bit high.

[Incipio NGP Advanced](http://imgur.com/a/mou7L): My favorite one. Slightly thinner than the Carnaby and provides better grip. Incipio drop rates this case for 5 ft. One con is that the power button cutout is a bit steep. I can still use the fingerprint sensor fine, but a more angled cutout would've been nice.

The other stuff in the pictures:

<TEXT> I encountered the same issue with my S7 Edge back in May. Others did as well. No matter the fix I tried, whether it was the phone or messing with my router, nothing fixed it. I believe most were able to fix it, but nothing worked in my situation and I ended up getting rid of it. I blamed it on faulty hardware with the phone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Usually" is the keyword. I usually blame the carriers for slow updates, but this year has showed me that isn't the case with LG and Samsung. Both of them have released unlocked U.S. models and both have treated those phones like second-class citizens. The unlocked G5, S7, and S7 Edge have all lagged behind in updates when compared to the carrier models. The unlocked G5 (RS988) is still on the July security patch and hasn't received Nougat yet. Meanwhile, carrier models have already been receiving the update and have gotten more consistent security patch updates. I wouldn't be surprised if the carriers are the ones pushing to get the updates out quicker and LG pretty much has to comply.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've gotten skins from both. Quality wise, both use 3M material and are precisely cut. It mainly comes down to customization. With dbrand, you can mix and match skins to get a unique look. Going with Slickwraps, you get a skin that will be the same design for every part of the phone.

In regards to shipping times, both can be a hit or miss. My last two orders from dbrand took a week for it to leave their facility in NY. However, both of those orders occurred during sales and delays were expected. My last Slickwraps order shipped within a couple of days. They're based out of Kansas.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Phones can be sold without being fully paid off. It's one of the negatives that came with the carriers moving away from the two year contract. As long as payments are still being made, the IMEI will appear clean. Once the payments stop, that's when it'll get blacklisted. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can do this with any carrier. I frequently buy and sell phones and have come across a lot of things. This type of scam became popular after carriers moved away from the two year contract. Payment plans don't show up in an IMEI search (I believe T-Mo does show EIP though) and the phone comes back clean. Even getting this info from some carriers is not possible. I've asked Verizon reps multiple times for various phones if they could check if a phone is still financed, but they can't say anything. As long as the original owner continues making device payments, the phone's IMEI will stay clean. However, once they stop, that's when it gets blacklisted. So a scammer can continue to make payments and stop after a few months and the buyer gets screwed. 

This happened to me with the Note 5 last year. Neither eBay nor PayPal were on my side even though I was within the six month period and provided info showing it blacklisted. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends. As you stated, the international version won't get warranty support. If something goes wrong within a year, then LG won't be able to help. Second, if it doesn't come with all of your carrier's bands, you're going to have subpar network performance, especially if it's missing an important LTE band. You can check out the [US carrier bands here](http://www.phonearena.com/news/Cheat-sheet-which-4G-LTE-bands-do-AT-T-Verizon-T-Mobile-and-Sprint-use-in-the-USA_id77933) and compare it to the ones the phone has. If you plan on keeping this phone for a while, then the next point likely won't matter, but an unlocked international model won't do well when it comes to the resale value. Their prices tend to drop the fastest and some buyers may be turned away from an international variant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's there for basic scratch protection. Skins are meant to provide any protection beyond that. 

As for the camera glass shattering, I don't believe it's a big issue. The people that have encountered it are very vocal about it. This is usually the case for most products. People that don't encounter issues don't feel a need to bring it up, but once something bad happens, that's when people start speaking up. For every person that reports the camera shattering, there are more out there that haven't cracked. Also, this isn't the first time it has been brought up for a device. Both the Nexus 6P and Galaxy S7 also had reports early on of the camera glass shattering. </TEXT>

Definitely gotta have a hair dryer on hand to get the sides to properly stick along the curved back plate.

<TEXT> I've used skins from both of them for previous devices and they're pretty much the same. If I had to pick one, I'd say I lean more towards dbrand, especially since they offer more customization. In regards to fitment, both provide precise cutouts.

I did have one negative quality experience with Slickwraps a couple years back. After I ordered a red carbon skin from them, I found out they switched to another vinyl supplier since they couldn't get red carbon from 3M. The skin arrived and it was crap. The carbon weave looked and felt odd. Since then, I have never ordered a carbon skin from them. They've likely switched back to 3M since then (the matte black V20 skin is by 3M), but that negative experience sticks with you. </TEXT>

* **Ordered**: Nov. 8 **Shipped**: Nov. 15 **Reveived**: Nov 17
* **Ordered**: Nov. 28 **Shipped**:  Dec. 9 **Received**: Dec. 12

My prior experiences with SW have been similar to dbrand. Sometimes they ship out quickly, but other times it can take a while. I decided to take a chance with the V20 skins since SW is located in Kansas and tend to arrive quicker. I ordered my matte black skin last week and received it yesterday, which happens to be the same day my Nov. 28 order from dbrand arrived. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had the force and absolutely loved it. I'd still be using it if I didn't sell it shortly after getting my second Note 7. Battery life between it and the Z Play is pretty big. On the Z Force, I would get between 4.5-5 hrs of SOT between charges. With the Z Play, I'm usually in the 8.5-9.5 hr range. The camera on the Z Force was a bit better, but not by much. It only slightly pulls ahead when it comes to low light performance. I never had the opportunity to hold both next to each other to compare displays, but I'd say they're even, unless you need that extra ppi for VR stuff. With regards to feel, the Z Force felt a bit odd in the hand when I first took it out the box. I got used to it, but I'd give overall feel to the Z Play. Software performance on both is great. From memory, I'd say the Force was ever so slightly faster, but it's really nothing too noticeable. I never experienced any noticeable performance issues with either device. </TEXT>

Way too thin for my liking and I didn't like the camera on it. I next got the Z Force and absolutely loved it. Camera was great, performance was top notch, and battery life was awesome. I'd still be using it if I didn't get the Note 7 :( After getting the Note, I sold the Z Force since I thought I'd be sticking with the Note for a while. Big mistake. After returning my Note 7, I bought the Z Play Droid. I got it since I loved the experience on the Z Force and it was much cheaper. It pretty much matches all the pros from the Z Force. For my usage, performance has been excellent. I haven't noticed any noticeable slowdowns. The camera takes great photos (much better than the regular Moto Z) and battery life is the best. Between the Z Force and Z Play, it'd be tough for me to pick a favorite. Value for the money definitely goes to the Play, but there's still something about the Force that makes me regret selling it so quickly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Keep in mind that Verizon likely had a lot to do with it since the Moto Z line all came out first on Verizon. The Moto X Pure Edition launched last year at a base price of $400. It was sold solely unlocked and without any carrier carrying it. If it was the same way with the Z line, I could see them selling at a lower price, but carriers like to include a markup and Verizon probably included some clause stating that the unlocked Moto Z and Z Play couldn't have a cheaper MSRP. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I gotta go with the band-aid phone. The Galaxy S5 looked alright from the front, but that thing went straight into a case right after I got it. The chromed plastic frame was terrible and the charging port flap was so cheap feeling. The flap was also prone to falling out and it made the phone even uglier. </TEXT>

With the right cable, it is possible. As for the charger, it's the stock one that has shipped with Samsung phones since the Note 4. The one I'm using now came with my S7 Edge. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on the cable. I have a Samsung Adaptive Fast Charger. With the Choetech Type A to C cable I have, it would activate turbo charging on my old Moto Z Force. However, with the Z Play I now have, it does not activate turbo charging. However, if I use the Type A to C cable that was included with my Samsung T3 portable SSD, it does turbo charge the Z Play. I don't use that Samsung cable though since I'm not sure if it's USB-C spec compliant and the last thing I want is to fry my phone. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After receiving an email five days back that a refund request was submitted on my behalf, I got another email today stating "The compensation request has been approved and is being processed by the Accounting Department." They've had mine since Oct. 25 for a third-party return. 

If the last Samsung rep I talked to on the 21st is correct, he gave a rough estimate of receiving the refund by the second week of December. The previous rep before that on the 14th gave me a date of December 6. Also, the rep from Nov. 14 stated my return wasn't in the system and I needed to provide her my tracking number to prove it had arrived. The one from the 21st said mine started the process on Nov. 19. So it took almost a month for there to be some movement with my phone. At least now I can stop my weekly calls to Samsung for status updates. </TEXT>

The customer rep mumbled something along the lines that it should have been done already since the 14th day had passed, but then she proceeded to count 5 regular days after it and continued to count 14 business days after those 5. She then came up with a random Dec. 6 date for when I should receive my refund. Instead of getting upset, I just let her talk since she clearly had no clue what she was doing. During the initial call that initiated my third party return, I (along with others) was told the refund by check would be issued within 10-14 business days. That time has clearly passed in my case. Gonna call again today and see how it goes. I've been a long time Samsung customer, but that will likely change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fees vary depending if you sell on eBay and Swappa. Since both use PayPal, they have their own 2.9% of sale price + $0.30 fee. eBay charges 10% of the final sale value (ridiculously high). Swappa used to charge a flat fee of $10 for each sale, but that changed this month, but it's still a lot more reasonable than eBay. I usually meet at the mall or a carrier store if I'm doing a Craigslist sale. I usually keep my loss below 30%. It just depends on the phone and how often retailers decide to put them on sale. If I initially  get a phone with discounts and gift cards I've earned through promotions, then I can often end up making more than what I initially paid.  </TEXT>

Just including smartphones since my first phone was a flip phone back in 2003. I'm pretty happy with the Z Play. Great performance and the battery life is the best I've ever experienced. :

* Moto Z Play
* Note 7 (2x)
* Galaxy S7
* Moto Z Force
* Moto X Pure Edition
* Nexus 6P
* GS7 Edge (2x)
* Nexus 5X (2x)

* Nexus 6 (2x)

* Note 4
* LG G3
* iPhone 5s
* Galaxy S5
* One M8
* Moto X Dev Edition
* LG G2
* Galaxy S4
* iPhone 5
* Nexus 4
* Galaxy S3
* HTC EVO 4g LTE
* Galaxy Nexus
* Galaxy Epic 4G Touch
* HTC EVO 3D
* Galaxy Epic 4G

Sadly, I have not kept any of these since I sell them after a while to offset the cost of the next phone. The phone I've kept around the longest has been the Nexus 6P (~ 8 months). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks! A full coverage tempered glass is not possible on the Moto Z and Z Play. The glass is slightly curved along the edges (similar to 2.5D glass) and it's the reason why they leave a large gap of glass exposed along all four sides. On the other hand, the top plastic layer on the Z Force is flat and allows Pleson to offer this edge-to-edge option.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Accessories for the moto z play + a couple for the z force </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-01 16:09:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Decided to post this in case someone is in the market for some accessories. I have been staying away from cases lately, but I decided to get a couple for the Z Play through Verizon's BOGO deal. ~~My favorite of the two has to be the Incipio~~ (see update below). The color combination looks great and it has a nice soft matte finish. The Tech21 case is a tad bit wider and taller than the Incipio, but it is slightly thinner. Both work great with the stock charger and third-party cables. The fingerprint sensor also remains easy to use.

When I'm not using a case, I stick to a dbrand skin for the back. The one that is currently on the Z Play was previously on my Z Force, but since I sold the Force, I pulled it off and applied it to the other one. Works perfectly with it and remains Moto Mod compatible. There's also a matte black skin over the camera glass. For screen protection I use a Skinomi skin since I didn't like the tempered glass ones being cut short due to the slightly curved edges of the glass. It works well with the cases and doesn't affect the clarity of the screen. There is a slight orange peel effect when the screen is off, but it's not bad. On my Z Force I had the Pleson tempered glass. Some reviews have been negative about it, but mine turned out great and offered solid full screen coverage.

<TEXT> I didn't directly come from the S7E, but I did own it earlier in the year. I got the Moto Z Play after returning my Note 7. Battery life shouldn't be a concern. I haven't even come close to draining the phone during the day. I don't play mobile games, but I do use it a lot and don't disable any services. I have yet to encounter any performance hiccups. For my usage, it has performed as well as the Moto Z Force I had prior to getting the Note 7.

Though the camera won't outperform the S7E, the one on the Moto Z Play has been remarkably good. I honestly didn't expect it. AnandTech even did some photo comparisons between the Z-line and the Z Play outperformed the regular Moto Z. 

The things I miss from Samsung are the camera app, multi-window (Nougat will fix that), and the phone's sexy build. Looking at the S7E never got old. Damn good looking phone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is because both Pixel phones have a slight curve (2.5D) along the edges. These make having an edge-to-edge tempered glass pretty much impossible without an air gap. Some companies get around this by adding colored border to the tempered glass, but all that does is hide the air gap. Others deal with it by cutting the tempered glass well short of the edges which leads to what you experienced. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nope. I was dumb and sold the two phones I already had (Moto Z Force   S7 Unlocked) right after getting the Note 7. Since this was supposed to be a "safe" unit, I didn't give it much thought. Totally regret it now though. The Z Force was a damn good phone. I should've kept one at least as a backup. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Verizon Already Blacklisting Note 7? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-16 01:03:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I got a text this morning on my Verizon Note 7 that stated the following:

 This device is not authorized for use. Please activate another device or call 800-922-0204 or service will be suspended but billing will continue

I immediately went to check my IMEI and it is showing up as being blacklisted. As of right now, my service is still working. Before calling that number, decided to do an online chat. The following is a section from the chat:

 **rep** : This is a safety issue and they are canceling any users phone who is still using one. WE will credit your account back and you can upgrade to a new phone today
**You** : There is a store I can go to. I understand that it has been recalled, but my other device isn't scheduled to arrive until Monday. If I understand correctly, Verizon is blacklisting the Note 7?
**rep** : It is being blacklisted, we do want anything to happen to our customers who still use the device

I looked it up more and found the following [XDA link](http://forum.xda-developers.com/verizon-note-7/help/started-blocking-imei-samsung-carriers-t3480701) with someone else bringing up the same thing. The OP mentions it happened after providing Samsung his IMEI to process the return. I called on the 12th and provided the same info. I'm still waiting for the box to arrive. 

I ended up calling the number Verizon provided in the text. After a long wait, the rep pretty much told me the same thing the online one did. Something along the lines that Verizon will be be preventing Note 7 phones from working on the network to protect customers. Has anyone else here encountered the same thing? If not, did you process your return directly with Verizon and bypassed Samsung? It will be interesting to see if this is only occurring to people that provided Samsung with the IMEI for the return or if Verizon is indeed going to do this for all phones.

**EDIT 10/16** Woke up in the morning with service disconnected. I did an online chat to see if I can get service again, but that didn't work. The chat rep did leave a note on my account and I was given a number to call. Called the number and the rep was very helpful. Also seemed to be a phone enthusiast himself. Somehow my phone was put in the lost/stolen list, but he also brought up the safety concern blacklist thing the other two reps mentioned. However, this was slightly different since he mentioned that Verizon is blacklisting Note 7 phones if they're in another country. Since they can't be brought onto a plane, he says they're automatically being blocked. He was rather surprised to learn my phone was blocked, but he was able to remove it from the lost/stolen list. Even after this, he said I would need to activate another phone to get service back up. A few hours after the call go by and I decide to log back into Verizon to see if I can reconnect the line with my Note 7. Went through the process and it worked. Got service back running. Can't wait for this whole mess to be over :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Z Play is the cheaper one. It sells for $409, but I got it through Moto for $348 before tax and with a free Incipio battery mod. The Moto Z's camera sensor is different (much older) than the one in the Z Force. I did a check and the Moto Z is using the same sensor that was used in the Nexus 6. Both the Z Force and Z Play are using newer, but different sensors. Actually, AnandTech did a photo comparison between them and both the Z Play and Z Force outperformed the regular Z. The Z Play was able to keep up with the Z Force for many shots, but the Force pulls ahead when it comes to low light conditions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you referring to the regular Moto Z or the Moto Z Play? I previously had the Moto Z and Z Force. The normal Moto Z is not worth it. The thing I hated most about it was the camera. The Z Force was excellent. Great display, solid camera, and was super snappy. I sold it right after getting the replacement Note 7. I didn't want to sell it, but it made no sense keeping both. Now I regret that choice. The Moto Z Play is currently on its way and should be here by Tuesday since it ships from China if ordered from Moto's site. Before I ordered, I was able to get some hands on time with one. Not enough to really give a decent comparison to the Note, but I feel like I will definitely enjoy using it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well worth the call. I told the first operator I got in contact with that I would be requesting a refund. She took down my info and asked where I got it from. She even brought up options like eBay and Craigslist, but I told her Swappa. Kinda surprised since I initially expected them to only accept carrier stores or Samsung.com orders. After that, I was transferred over to the Colorado center people have mentioned. That was a very long wait so don't lose hope if it takes over 40 minutes. The second operator took down my info again and asked for the IMEI. 

Once done, I was told I would be receiving the return packaging. I was also told that all accessories had to be returned with the phone. Doesn't bother me, but I'm sure there are some out there that won't like this. Whole call from the first operator to the second one lasted a little over an hour. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If an unlockable bootloader matters to you, then you should probably stay away from the Verizon version. Other than that, people saying that updates will be slower are just speculating right now. The "bloatware" is just three uninstallable apps. Security updates will still be through Google, with OS-level updates handled by Verizon. Tough to say if there will be much of a delay since the Verizon Nexus 6 has gotten OS updates as quickly as the unlocked model. That said, unless you can get a discount by ordering through Verizon, then go that route, but the Google Store model is probably the safest route for the moment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They certainly are in a better position due to Samsung's mess. However, given the lack of carrier availability, I think the impact will be rather small. The people that are going to be returning their Note devices to carriers other than Verizon are going to be opting for whatever device is in stock. My money is on the iPhone being the next obvious pick since LG still hasn't launched the V20.

<TEXT> Most people just like them for the leaks. I hate reading AP for reviews, no matter the device. David is mainly the one doing reviews and he always finds something to complain about. Discussing cons is one thing, but he really likes to dwell on the negative aspects. Even the guy who created AP and APKMirror (Artem R.) is the same way. [Here he is](https://plus.google.com/+ArtemRussakovskii/posts/dFuE11p5Uaw) singling out Backdrops because he didn't like how they did version numbers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sounds like a fake one to me

 Klering says Samsung also wanted possession of his device but he refused to give it up. 

Also, the hole in the case is rather suspicious. Those Pelican cases are pretty thick and a Note 7 bursting still probably couldn't cause that damage. A puncture through the case, whether on accident or purposefully, would cause the phone to burst. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are reasons to buy from Verizon, if you're a Verizon customer. Yes, Verizon sucks, but it's still going to be interesting to see how much slower the updates will be, if at all. The Nexus 6 on Verizon has been getting updates as quickly as the unlocked model and I'm sure Verizon also has to approve those. The main thing that will probably matter to some is the bootloader, but in that case, you already likely decided against the Verizon model. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It would make no financial sense for the phone manufacturers. There isn't a large enough consumer base for it to work out in the long run. Even with the previous GPE devices, manufacturers still had to add in extra stuff to get certain parts of their hardware working correctly (e.g. HTC's sound mods and other software that is licensed). So now instead of supporting just their line of devices, they need to allocate developers to support a separate model. </TEXT>

Album links below to what I'm currently using:

* [Skinomi TechSkin Full Coverage](http://imgur.com/a/2aI5o)
* [dbrand bamboo](http://imgur.com/a/jOkOP)

I also have a [Spigen Thin Fit case](http://imgur.com/a/oHqSJ), but haven't used it with my new Note 7. The Thin Fit is the only case I've owned that is compatible with the full coverage screen protector. If anyone out there is using a full coverage screen protector with a different case, please let me know since it's always good to have some options.

For my old Note 7, I used the [IQ Shield Full Body skin](http://imgur.com/a/MG30u). If anyone is curious in how some cases look on the Note 7, I had the following ones for my previous Note 7, but ended up getting rid of them.

<TEXT> As a regular seller, I've learned that bundling accessories with your devices doesn't necessarily lead to more value when it goes to sell. There are exceptions for some accessories, but most of the time, you'll only get back a small fraction of what you paid for it. Just look at other listings and compare what they're offering for the price they have. If someone is just selling the phone with the original accessories, you can obviously price yours higher, but you also need to take into account the condition of the phone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've had both. I can't really say much about battery life on the S7 Edge (VZW model) since I had wifi problems with it which led to average battery life based on other phones I've owned. Also, I couldn't stand accidentally touching the edges, especially while in the camera app. I sold it after a month or ownership. I got an unlocked S7 (U.S. model) recently. Battery life was great. I would easily get 4-5hrs of SOT. The size was great for one-hand use, but dang did I miss having the larger display.

If your main concern is battery life and don't care about a larger screen, then I'd go with the regular S7 and decide at a later point if you need the battery pack. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did a crappy job of explaining it up top. Back when Verizon first rolled out Advanced Calling 1.0, users had to go online and enable the option to get features like HD Voice and simultaneous voice   data. Verizon later changed the branding from "Advanced Calling" to just "HD Voice." With HD Voice enabled, people with unlocked phones on Verizon will only get access to simultaneous voice and data. Below is how VZW explains it:

 With HD Voice, when you're connected to the Verizon 4G LTE network, you can surf the web, continue a download, use an application, or use a feature like Mobile Hotspot while talking on a call, regardless of whether the person you're calling has HD Voice or not.

They bundle HD Voice, Wifi Calling and simultaneous voice   data all into one option. However, enabling that feature on your Verizon account  doesn't give you access to all those things with unlocked phones. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Apple, LG, and Huawei all use their dual camera setups differently. From what I understand, Apple mainly uses it for the 2x optical zoom and the bokeh effect. With LG, you can take a normal style shot or opt for a wide-angle one. So pretty much here both are acting separately. Like Apple, Huawei uses both sensors simultaneously. However, one is RGB and the other is monochrome. Huawei uses both sensors to supposedly create the best shot. They also have their own bokeh mode. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a great phone. The camera is solid and overall performance has been great. I'm a tech addict and usually get a new phone and sell my previous one multiple times a year. However, the 6P has been the first device I've kept for longer than four months. I've had it for a little over six months and it has never let me down. 

That said, it was really nice when I finally got my hands on the Note 7. I instantly got hooked. I previously had the S7 Edge, but got rid of it since I would accidentally touch the curved panels way too often. Though the camera on the 6P is no slouch, the Note 7 is on another level. I saw people complaining about lag on the Note 7, but I never noticed any slowdowns. I also don't have any problems with OEM skins. Stock Android is great, but it's also nice to move away from the plain experience to a more robust set of features like Samsung provides. If this battery recall never came up, I likely would have sold my 6P.

Forgot to mention that battery life is much better with the Note 7. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you order from ebay, make sure it's the U.S. model. I've come across a lot of people here on Reddit thinking they got the U.S. one, but in reality they purchased the international variant because it was on sale. If you're not aware, the model number for the U.S. is LG-H790 and the Intl one is LG-H791. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It won't affect carrier branding. Besides, the recall only affected the batteries. The other aspects of the manufacturing process hasn't changed. That means those colorful backs with AT T and VZW logos are well in stock. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. Verizon and AT T love putting their branding everywhere. It sucks, but it's just how it is. Until Samsung releases an unlocked U.S. model compatible with all the carriers, you're stuck getting carrier branded ones. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It has held up great. I usually buy these type of screen protectors for my devices with curved edges so I'm not new to them. As for the thing you're referring to, it's called the orange peel effect and is common among wet application films. It's only noticeable with the screen off. With the screen on, it doesn't affect the display quality and pretty much doesn't look like a screen protector is on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since Verizon occasionally does open enrollment for phone insurance, that'll probably be your only way of hopefully getting onto a newer revision. However, then you're at the mercy of Asurion's stock quality. The few times I've used them, I haven't had any major issues, but there's usually someone out there with a bad Asurion experience. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Slickwraps Naked Wrap on Gold Nexus 6P </TITLE>

<TEXT> [Slickwraps Naked Wrap](http://imgur.com/a/Yuu69)

Other skins I've used on my gold Nexus 6P

* [Purple dbrand](http://imgur.com/a/eSV6I)

* [White Carbon Fiber dbrand](http://imgur.com/a/O3KeX)

I installed the clear skin a few days back. Overall, it's a great alternative to those who want to protect their device with a skin, but still want to keep the original look. For those who have used a liquid installation skin before from a brand like Skinomi or IQ Shield, the process is the same. Installation instructions are included with the skin.

Even though Slickwraps customer service stated it adds grip, it doesn't really add any grip. It does have a matte finish and does a great job from preventing fingerprint buildup. The only really place the skin is easy to spot is over the black bar. Other than that, it blends in with the phone nicely.

Comparing Slickwraps to dbrand shipping: 

* SW: I got this skin during the recent sale they had. I ordered it late in the morning and it surprisingly shipped out the same day and arrived quickly via the standard shipping method. I say "surprisingly" since my previous shipping experiences with them in 2015 were less than stellar. It arrived in a padded envelope and the packaging shown in the imgur album. The skin arrived undamaged.

* dbrand: Shipping with them can be a hit or miss. Sometimes they've shipped out a skin within a couple of days and other times it has taken up to a week or slightly more. However, they recently switched their standard shipping to DHL with tracking so that's a nice change compared to the previous (slow) one with USPS and no tracking. The one negative is their envelope. It's basically a standard envelope and isn't padded. I've had a couple of skins arrive creased, likely from damage during shipping.

<TEXT> In addition to Amazon and Best Buy, it looks like Google has decided to join the discount for the gold variant. Probably a better choice for those who want to sign up for Nexus Protect and better support from Google CS.

<TEXT> So I recently graduated and never took the exam while in school even though the professors kept telling us we should. For those who past the new computer based exam, did you use any of the review manuals provided by Kaplan or Lindeburg? I have to take the Civil version of the exam and I already know I should familiarize myself with the reference handbook. If I do buy a review manual I think I might go for the Kaplan version since it's a lot cheaper than Lindeburg's $160 book. Just hoping it's not a you get what you pay for situation since Kaplan's only costs $68. </TEXT>
