<TEXT> **This is a warning! Please read my story and heed my advice! Tell everyone you can not to make the same mistake I made!**

I am a fitness freak, *was* a fitness freak. Marathons, Tae Bo, P90X and Insanity, basketball twice a week, indoor soccer, free weights twice a week, cycling every Sunday morning, and exploring trails and caves in between. That is until I suffered a double hernia. I was in the early prime of my life and just beginning to peak, I mean HUGE gains the month before. My wife wasnt the happiest about how much time I spent working out but she sure appreciated the results. Anyway, back to the hernia. It would have been fine if it had been an umbilical hernia, those arent so bad. Usually back to work the next day with no complications if you are in any semblance of fitness. Of course, I wasnt so lucky. 

Mine were lower, very low  an indirect inguinal hernia and a femoral hernia  both of which I was told were congenital, meaning I was born with them. Apparently the extreme workouts built enough muscle in places I never really had to force my intestines around into wherever they could go and bam, a huge bulge just below my waistline. Insert penis joke here. 

Normally I wouldnt worry about it. I have pushed through injuries all the time and heal quickly. The first time I felt it happen I just pushed it back in and kept going at it, scissor kick after scissor kick. It didnt show up again for another two weeks but it hurt that time and from then on as well. I could always push it back in but it started to pop out more and more frequently. Totally freaked out my wife the first time it happened during sex, Ill tell you what. She dialed my doctor for me, still naked, and pushed the phone into my hand to make an appointment.

Fast forward a few weeks and I am getting wheeled out of the clinic with a small incision and a little bag full of meds. The doctor said I was lucky nothing serious happened like intestine strangulation because it was very bad, so bad that they had to use a new procedure to fill all the gaps. I dont speak doctor but basically, she said it looked like an ant colony down there, lots of little holes and rooms for the intestines to get trapped in and back me up really good. 

I had taken that day, Friday, off of work to get the procedure done and had to be back on Monday bright and early  something I really didnt think would be an issue. That is until I tried to take my first step or sit up in bed or take a leak. Who knew such a tiny cut could cause so much damage and pain? I made it in to work much to the dismay of my wife but I wasnt much use. I couldnt stand up fully straight and I couldnt lift or push anything over five pounds. I basically shuffled around like an old man in a robe and loafers trying to find his glasses. Towards the end of the shift, my boss called me in and asked me how I was doing (not great) and decided to give me the rest of the week off to recover faster. I wasnt happy about it, (pride you know?) but I did go home.

Things didnt improve that week, nor the week after. In fact, things only progressed downward. I regained some strength and mobility but I kept getting shooting pains throughout my body that began at my incision and lanced out in all directions, pulsing once, then twice. The incision was always itchy and tingly and felt like something was moving around, burrowing or pushing my insides around. It reminded me of the ant colony analogy my doctor used  thousands of ants crawling along the underside of my skin laying eggs in all of my organs and muscle tissue. My head throbbed, my eyes were itchy and red constantly, even my brain itched. Have you ever felt like that?

Then, suddenly, it was all gone. The pain, the tightness in my muscles, the tickly tingles under my skin. I went back to work like nothing had ever happened, stronger and spryer than before, like I hadnt missed almost a month of workouts. In fact, my usual weights seemed a bit lighter and I was quicker than I used to be on the basketball court. I hit the gym hard for a month trying to capitalize on this high I was on and turn it into sick gains. As they say, though, all good things must come to an end. 

It started out small  a missed step up the stairs or my hand letting go of a weight mid-curl like a total gym-tool. Each day it seemed to get worse, more missed steps, sometimes even going the wrong direction. Cutting to the left and out of bounds is pretty embarrassing in the middle of a championship basketball game. It was like I had zero control of my body!

I am not sure what prompted me but I began looking into the new procedure they had used on me during my outpatient operation. I couldnt quite remember what the doctor had said so it took a while for me to find it but it is called Nanomesh and it is supposed to fix all the issues they have had in the past with mesh inserts slipping, getting rejected by the surrounding tissues, and causing internal pain and bleeding. Instead, this mesh is flexible and adapts to your body so that it can blend right into any multitude of tissues it is placed by and can stretch and even grow to close off holes that appear near it. In theory, it sounds awesome. In practice, however, all the kinks havent been worked out quite right. 

So here we are in the here and now. Things have become much worse since I have begun to type this up almost two weeks ago. I have had to resort to writing out a section in random emails or on forums and then cutting and pasting them into this document in order to fool myself (hopefully it will all make sense) but I dont know how much longer Ill be able to keep it up. It is learning quickly, taking over more and more each day. The mesh. I think it has spread much further than just a few inches to heal newly formed holes. It is in my brain, controlling everything I do. Sometimes I can force myself but often I fail, unable to break through the hold it has on my body. 

My wife is lying on the floor next to me, dead. I, it, we, killed her after a few questions too many for our liking. She is really decomposed now, and the flies are coating her so thickly I cant even see her once beautiful hair. Fortunately, the mesh has turned off my ability to smell otherwise Id probably vomit from the stench of her rotting flesh. Once I finish this I am going to try and kill myself. I doubt it will work but maybe I can trick it, or force someone to kill me. Whatever. 

Please, if you get a hernia or need anything like a mesh insert **do not** let them use Nanomesh.

--------------

*Good evening! Today has been mellow so far, thank God, but that wont continue much longer. If you take a look at the monitor with me youll see a massive front coming in. It initially looked like it was coming in this morning, early afternoon at the latest, but a strong current from the southeast has slowed it down and shifted it slightly. Expect four to five inches of snow by ten pee em and over a foot when you wake up tomorrow morning. Bundle up, get home, and stay safe.*

Behind him, the green screen switches from a Doppler map to a comical cartoon scene of Bugs Bunny holding on to a tree by his fingertips. The tree bends and sways enough to touch the ground but never breaks and a large mound of snow drops from the sky to blanket the ground, tree, and bunny instantaneously. 

Cut to commercial and the weatherman steps off of the small stage, pulling earpiece and power-pack off of the rear of his belt. He walks stiffly down the corridor, loosening his tie in stride, to his small dressing room to grab his heavy coat.

Good evening, Phyllis. Get home safe, okay? It is going to be a bad one, promise.

You always say that, Kirk. The smile on her face was unnecessary because it rang true with each word she spoke.

Kirk stopped at her desk and leaned forward, hands on each side of her large computer monitor, and stared down at her. The color turning to white on each of his knuckles and the stern, set jawline clued her in to his seriousness. Phyllis, please. Can you take me seriously one time? Go home early and stay indoors.

She nodded slowly and tried to smile her usual smile. He was scaring her and she didnt know how to respond. He was normally such a silly, laid back guy. (Imminent doom will do that to a guy.)

------------

With that, he turned on his expensive brown leather-soled shoes and stalked out to his car with purpose. The engine roared to life fifteen steps before he passed the rear bumper and the powerful engine had the car warm and ready to go by the time his seatbelt clicked into place. Technology, so beautiful and elegant when applied properly. The comforts we now possess are incredible, no? 

He reversed the car and made his way out of the basement carports, tires screeching on the smooth, polished cement floor. The radio crackled to life once the hood of the car peeked out from the underground bed it was sleeping in  traffic was light, but it wouldnt stay that way. Every weatherman in the five surrounding counties was issuing the same warning. Get home, stay inside, and pray you have enough candles and water to make it. 

The storm hit as soon as his car turned off from the highway and onto his country road  well used and in dire need of attention. Of course, he had memorized all of the pot holes and mud slicks so he didnt mind. He had a large all-wheel drive SUV after all, it wouldnt matter if he knew each low point or not. Winds pushed and pressed against the drivers side of his vehicle with increasing vehemence and power. It was getting hard for him to keep it moving straight, muscles straining against the rebelling steering wheel. Snowflakes were dancing across his windows too fast to need wipers. 

He slowed down to twenty to maintain control  only two more miles to go before he could turn into his driveway. The snow began to stick and accumulate, thicker and thicker flakes created by the cruel heavens above coming faster and faster. With defrost on full blast and wipers swishing madly back and forth on the heated windshield he could forge out just enough visibility to stay on the two-lane road if he stayed in the center. Not the best place to be considering most of the biggest ruts and holes were in the center  but what choice did he have? 

The largest of holes was just in front of him, although he had no idea until his SUV was jarred and began spinning its tires. His head snapped back and to the left, cracking roughly into the freezing cold window. He switched on the all-wheel drive and tow features to try to get himself out but the wet snow and strong rubber made for poor teammates. Instead of moving him forward he only succeeded in making the rut deeper, further tilting the car. Throwing the car into reverse he gently touched his foot to the accelerator pedal, nothing. In fear and frustration, he stomped on it and the car lurched momentarily, then settled back down into its new parking spot. He was stuck. 

His head settled back against the headrest in defeat, the wheels in his head turning furiously. The storm wouldnt be over for half a day. Could he wait it out without freezing to death? His eyes flicked to the gas gauge, half full. Probably not  this beast didnt get the best miles per gallon. How far was he from home? A mile, a little more maybe? He could run a mile in eight minutes, even in business attire, but what about in the storm? He risked it.

Donning his gloves, overcoat, scarf, and wool cap, he took a deep breath and killed the engine and pushed open the door. Or rather, he tried to push open the door. The wind ripped through the tiny crack between the door seal and the frame, instantly freezing him to the core. A snow drift almost to the window had built up in just minutes, impeding his exit on that side. The wind, as far as he could judge, was at least sixty miles per hour. Even in the roomy interior of the SUV his lanky frame had difficulty moving over to the passenger side. Knees and feet and elbows bumped and banged and dug into every console and component on his way, stiff and sore and annoyed before stepping one foot into the storm.

The door opened easily and he lost his balance from the excessive force he applied, tumbling out onto the hard, cold ground. Cursing and reaching for his cap that had fallen off he stands, takes one last look at the warm cabin of the vehicle, then takes off in the direction of his home. 

Step by plodding step he ran. The wind howled in his ears and buffeted him off course each time his foot lifted from the compact dirt. With each five steps, he took one moved him towards his goal and the wind picked up still more. Brittle, delicate, soft  the snowflakes instead cut into his skin like tiny ninja stars dipped in poison. Breathing became increasingly more difficult. The frigid air seared his passageways with each breath and chapped his lips and surrounding skin with each exhale. His eyes wanted to hide behind their lids, afraid of the wicked wind and the endless white they processed. 

---------------

*Tragic news last night, our local weather man was found dead just outside of his car after being caught in a freak storm on the way home. Police were on the scene early this morning when a semi-truck passing on the highway spotted the car askew in the middle of the road and radioed it in. Investigations are ongoing.*

The storm he was predicting ended up centralizing over his road, and only his road. In fact, it was only one-eighth of a mile square. The build-up of snow found around his car indicated the wind speeds reached hurricane force and over four feet of snow accumulated overnight. His body was found nineteen steps from his SUV curled in a ball and frozen solid. His lungs and stomach were full of frozen water on account of his mouth freezing open wide and his eyeballs burst from the extreme cold.

If you want to be a weatherman let this be a warning to you. We are a sacred group, dedicating our lives to accurately portraying the weather. We hold many secrets and we hold them dearly. We take care of our own and we **do not** tolerate oath-breaking.

The engine roared to life fifteen steps before he passed the rear bumper and the powerful engine had the car warm and ready to go by the time his seatbelt clicked into place. Technology, so beautiful and elegant when applied properly. The comforts we now possess are incredible, no? 

He reversed the car and made his way out of the basement carports, tires screeching on the smooth, polished cement floor. The radio crackled to life once the hood of the car peeked out from the underground bed it was sleeping in  traffic was light, but it wouldnt stay that way. Every weatherman in the five surrounding counties was issuing the same warning. Get home, stay inside, and pray you have enough candles and water to make it. 

The storm hit as soon as his car turned off from the highway and onto his country road  well used and in dire need of attention. Of course, he had memorized all of the pot holes and mud slicks so he didnt mind. He had a large all-wheel drive SUV after all, it wouldnt matter if he knew each low point or not. Winds pushed and pressed against the drivers side of his vehicle with increasing vehemence and power. It was getting hard for him to keep it moving straight, muscles straining against the rebelling steering wheel. Snowflakes were dancing across his windows too fast to need wipers. 

He slowed down to twenty to maintain control  only two more miles to go before he could turn into his driveway. The snow began to stick and accumulate, thicker and thicker flakes created by the cruel heavens above coming faster and faster. With defrost on full blast and wipers swishing madly back and forth on the heated windshield he could forge out just enough visibility to stay on the two-lane road if he stayed in the center. Not the best place to be considering most of the biggest ruts and holes were in the center  but what choice did he have? 

The largest of holes was just in front of him, although he had no idea until his SUV was jarred and began spinning its tires. His head snapped back and to the left, cracking roughly into the freezing cold window. He switched on the all-wheel drive and tow features to try to get himself out but the wet snow and strong rubber made for poor teammates. Instead of moving him forward he only succeeded in making the rut deeper, further tilting the car. Throwing the car into reverse he gently touched his foot to the accelerator pedal, nothing. In fear and frustration, he stomped on it and the car lurched momentarily, then settled back down into its new parking spot. He was stuck. 

His head settled back against the headrest in defeat, the wheels in his head turning furiously. The storm wouldnt be over for half a day. Could he wait it out without freezing to death? His eyes flicked to the gas gauge, half full. Probably not  this beast didnt get the best miles per gallon. How far was he from home? A mile, a little more maybe? He could run a mile in eight minutes, even in business attire, but what about in the storm? He risked it.

Donning his gloves, overcoat, scarf, and wool cap, he took a deep breath and killed the engine and pushed open the door. Or rather, he tried to push open the door. The wind ripped through the tiny crack between the door seal and the frame, instantly freezing him to the core. A snow drift almost to the window had built up in just minutes, impeding his exit on that side. The wind, as far as he could judge, was at least sixty miles per hour. Even in the roomy interior of the SUV his lanky frame had difficulty moving over to the passenger side. Knees and feet and elbows bumped and banged and dug into every console and component on his way, stiff and sore and annoyed before stepping one foot into the storm.

The door opened easily and he lost his balance from the excessive force he applied, tumbling out onto the hard, cold ground. Cursing and reaching for his cap that had fallen off he stands, takes one last look at the warm cabin of the vehicle, then takes off in the direction of his home. 

Step by plodding step he ran. The wind howled in his ears and buffeted him off course each time his foot lifted from the compact dirt. With each five steps, he took one moved him towards his goal and the wind picked up still more. Brittle, delicate, soft  the snowflakes instead cut into his skin like tiny ninja stars dipped in poison. Breathing became increasingly more difficult. The frigid air seared his passageways with each breath and chapped his lips and surrounding skin with each exhale. His eyes wanted to hide behind their lids, afraid of the wicked wind and the endless white they processed.

*Tragic news last night, our local weather man was found dead just outside of his car after being caught in a freak storm on the way home. Police were on the scene early this morning when a semi-truck passing on the highway spotted the car askew in the middle of the road and radioed it in. Investigations are ongoing.*

The storm he was predicting ended up centralizing over his road, and only his road. In fact, it was only one-eighth of a mile square. The build-up of snow found around his car indicated the wind speeds reached hurricane force and over four feet of snow accumulated overnight. His body was found nineteen steps from his SUV curled in a ball and frozen solid. His lungs and stomach were full of frozen water on account of his mouth freezing open wide and his eyeballs burst from the extreme cold.

If you want to be a weatherman let this be a warning to you. We are a sacred group, dedicating our lives to accurately portraying the weather. We hold many secrets and we hold them dearly. We take care of our own and we **do not** tolerate oath-breaking.

*Good evening! Today has been mellow so far, thank God, but that wont continue much longer. If you take a look at the monitor with me youll see a massive front coming in. It initially looked like it was coming in this morning, early afternoon at the latest, but a strong current from the southeast has slowed it down and shifted it slightly. Expect four to five inches of snow by ten pee em and over a foot when you wake up tomorrow morning. Bundle up, get home, and stay safe.*

Behind him, the green screen switches from a Doppler map to a comical cartoon scene of Bugs Bunny holding on to a tree by his fingertips. The tree bends and sways enough to touch the ground but never breaks and a large mound of snow drops from the sky to blanket the ground, tree, and bunny instantaneously. 

Cut to commercial and the weatherman steps off of the small stage, pulling earpiece and power-pack off of the rear of his belt. He walks stiffly down the corridor, loosening his tie in stride, to his small dressing room to grab his heavy coat.

Good evening, Phyllis. Get home safe, okay? It is going to be a bad one, promise.

You always say that, Kirk. The smile on her face was unnecessary because it rang true with each word she spoke.

Kirk stopped at her desk and leaned forward, hands on each side of her large computer monitor, and stared down at her. The color turning to white on each of his knuckles and the stern, set jawline clued her in to his seriousness. Phyllis, please. Can you take me seriously one time? Go home early and stay indoors.

She nodded slowly and tried to smile her usual smile. He was scaring her and she didnt know how to respond. He was normally such a silly, laid back guy. (Imminent doom will do that to a guy.)

<TEXT> **VIRRRR VIRRRRRR RIZZZZZZZZZZZZ**

The drill motor slowed and stopped, blood pooling at my feet, bits of flesh tenuously clinging to the six inch bit. I had stopped screaming long ago although my mouth still split wide with each touch of the hot metal  my vocal chords pushed far past their limits. 

He had started on the slowest speed and the biggest muscle claiming the slow speed did more damage. Instead of just drilling through it pulled and tore at the surrounding area, pulling larger pieces of meat with it and wrapping tendons. I cant say it did or didnt because I blacked out after the first few seconds of it entering my thigh. Each time I shut down he would wake me with the high-pitched whine of the drill millimeters from my ear and a hard slap to the face. 

The hands were the worst. Multiple holes now littered them, bones severed by the merciless tool, tendons and muscle shredded and useless. My head hung low, mind foggy from pain and exhaustion and blood loss. The soft crunching of footsteps stirred me slightly and I rolled my head slightly to the left and brought my eyes up to the highest point in their sockets. My grandfather stood directly in front of me, hands clasped behind his back.

Did I not warn you? There was sadness in his voice.

I searched him with my eyes for answers but found none. This is your doing?

I tried to warn you, tried to instill a love of this world, every world. I thought you understood, Aaron. 

Anger swelled within me, giving me a new strength. My head snapped up and my body pushed against its restraints. Pain exploded in one hundred tiny bursts across my body but I didnt care. What is *wrong* with you? You would torture your own grandson over a tree?!

The frown on his face grew deeper, his age showing in a crisscross of wrinkles, and he motioned for the jar. Onion Man handed it over and grandfather lifted it up to eye level, peering inside at the eternal inferno. His eyes took on a crimson hue from the flickering flames. How could this man be my grandfather? The man who spent every moment he could teaching me how to fish, tend to gardens, tie knots, and pop a wheelie. The man who read Shakespeare each night to his sick wife and spun wondrous tales to us tucked warmly in bed. The man who cried at every family wedding and every funeral. No, this was not that man. This was no man at all.

Balance. Every world has one, every world *needs* one to survive. Too much life and there are not enough nutrients to go around, too much death and there is not enough left to keep species going. Chain reactions ripple through the ecosystems and cause dependent species to die, then another, then another. Eventually there is nothing left. When I first came to this Inner World it was by accident. I was tasked to explore a fox hole and collapse it if necessary. After over an hour of crawling I still hadnt found an end, or even a branch to another tunnel but I came across a drop that went straight down. I shined my light down but couldnt see anything. I couldnt get across so I dropped a grenade and hauled back as fast as I could.

He paused there, regret clearly expressed in his eyes. When I made it back out and described it to the Sergeant he wanted the whole area torched and blown to hell. He was a pretty superstitious guy so we did as he said. What we ended up doing was ripping open a portal to this world and then the napalm hit.

He slowly turned the jar in his hands, inspecting each individual tip of flame. Of course I had to pay for my crimes, accidental or not, and that is where the story came from. I found the portal and stopped anymore from entering here. I shared that story with you, hoping my mistakes would not be repeated. Why couldnt you have listened to me?

Nature isnt the only thing that needs balance, Gramps. Your psyche could use a little right now.

With that he stepped forward and began unscrewing the jar. The heat escaped immediately and washed over my cold, weak body. It felt good, if only momentarily, then was so intense I turned as far away as the restraints allowed. Just before he tipped the jar I lashed out with everything I had and caught him off guard. My head knocked the jar from his hands and napalm went flying across the room. 

My momentum tossed me and the chair I was on sideways and I landed with a hard thud. Panic set it instantly, hunger fire devouring whatever it could find. The trees went up quickly and the smell of caramelized onions filled my nostrils. The room was a flurry of movement and a cacophony of screams in octaves Id never heard before, deep like an earthquake. I struggled on the floor to free myself of my bonds but nothing would give.

Fire spread and the screams died down. The only sound in the room was the crackle of the flames and the scrape of my chair on the floor as I inched toward the only exit. I could feel the heat on my hands and neck, closer, closer, closer. A scream ripped from my raw throat when the first of the napalm leapt onto me. Skin charred, peeled, melted, but so did my bonds. I rolled, one to be free and two to put out the fire. My injuries left me feeling weak and crippled but I managed to get to one leg and hop out of the burning room. I looked back once to see where my grandfather was but saw no sign of him. 

Several hours later I found a portal. Which portal it was I didnt know but at least it was a way out. The land around me was beginning to catch fire, much slower than it did the first time I am sure, but spread it would. Hopefully it would finish the job this time. A charred figure made its way through the wall of fire and shouted at me. The wall stuck with it, engulfing it like a suicide bomber. Whatever it said I couldnt hear it and I honestly didnt want to - I stepped through the portal.

<TEXT> my father always told me to seek out joy in everything i do so i did.

i tried goin to the park en walkin the trails, playin frisbee, fishin. i joined book clubs en read all of the bestest books even writin my own stories en poems to share. tried yoga, hot yoga, cyclin classes, free weights. nothin worked! 

no matter what i did joy eluded me. no not eluded! joy flat out ran from me

i ran as hard en fast as i could but i could never catch joy. eventually i got depressed en just stayed at home. what was the point of going out en doing things without joy in my life? joy is important, ya know? 

the restrainin order she set against me is what really did it for me. why wouldn she want to live here with me so that i can be joyous? So this is my letter of resignation from life. i'll try'n find joy one more time but if i fail i cant go on any more </TEXT>

<TEXT> 

*Hand in hand with my grandfather, we made the leap into the hole together. I felt as if I was turned upside down, stomach clenched tight and churning, when a jolt traveled up my feet and ended somewhere in my back. My knees and back ached from the sudden impact but I didnt let go of his hand. With a sweep of our necks we took in the strange surroundings. Blue trees, soft red sky, sheets of yellow clouds stretching out forever, and a small onion running on thin legs in an unknown direction. What choice did we have now? We followed.*

If my neck wasnt stiff already I would say it was now. I pulled myself to my feet and blinked back the tears forming at the corners of each eye. A searing pain raced up and down my spine and each shoulder throbbed. Barely able to twist my neck, I could see bright red blood dripping down my arms from deep scrapes on each shoulder.  Whatever that thing was, it wasnt the Gentle Giant. 

With closed eyes, mostly because of the pain but also fear, I went through a few stretches from high school cross-country to loosen up my back and neck. It helped somewhat although I would have much preferred a few coated pills and a whiskey. When I felt sufficiently loose and marginally less fearful I opened my eyes to take in the view. 

I stood in a thick copse of trees the color of tropical ocean water, bright blue and radiant. Above me loomed a red sky like a velvet blanket slowly settling down around you. The ground felt different under my feet, softer, less dense, like a freshly tilled patch of dirt that is sitting loosely waiting for seed. The air I breathed was not toxic but it had an abrasive quality to it  burning my eyes and forcing me to blink often. A deep bellow rang out harshly and the ground I stood on rumbled. I ran. 

*Grandfather and I caught up with the Onion Man once he stopped at the top of a low hill, teardrop shaped body quivering with excitement.*

*Look, the fire rages. If it is not stopped our home will be destroyed.*

*From the top of the hill we could see in all directions. A fierce wall of green flames licked at everything in sight, moving quickly with a hunger Id never seen before, as if alive.*

*What caused the fire? Grandfather asked.*

*We know not. A small ember fell through the central portal and grows rapidly. We cannot stop it. That is why I was sent to find you both, Wise One and Courageous One. Please, help us?*

*Can we fix it for them, grandpa?*

*We will do what we can. His face was solemn and gaze fixed on the raging fire in the distance.*

I ran until my lungs burned and my back could tolerate the motion no more. I collapsed to the ground with spasms in my back and my chest heaving up and down. Spittle formed a thick layer on my lips and perspiration dripped down each temple to cheek and chin. The bellow had finally stopped but my ears still rang with it. Raising my head I realized I had broken free of the trees and panted on my hands and knees in the middle of a barren plain. Rolling hills stretched out in all directions, the low valleys between them scorched and picked clean like a carcass in the desert. 

My mind raced, searching my memory, trying to make sense of what was happening. Could his story really be true? It made no sense, it was just a bedtime story. Was I dreaming? Back on my couch tossing and turning and ready to jolt awake at any moment? Another bellow, closer this time, broke me out of my thoughts and I pushed myself to my feet. I couldnt go back the way I came but I knew another way out  that is, if the story is real. 

Why was I brought here? Was I actually here before? What do they want from me? I played through the story in my head as I ran.

*Thousands of vegetable creatures fled the fire  onions, beets, carrots, broccoli, whole shrubs and aloe plants. Massive sequoias plodded slowly, huge root systems for feet tossed dirt clods the size of VW Bugs left and right. Most of the larger trees were too slow, consumed from behind by the unnatural flames that blazed across their land.*

*Grandfather stood and watched for a moment, hand on his chin, other hand holding tightly to mine.*

*Tell all of the creatures to run toward the edges and loop behind it. The fire can only move in one direction and eventually will burn out. Once it dies out you can drop roots once again and rebuild your world. My grandson and I will find the source and ensure no more is coming from our world.*

*The Onion Man looked at us for a second, then bowed toward the ground and scampered off to spread the new orders.*

*Grandpa, will that work? It doesnt look like normal fire.*

*Napalm. A portal must have been opened somewhere in Vietnam during the war and it leaked down into their world. It makes me wonder how time passes here compared to our world.*

*Time can pass differently? How?*

*That is a discussion for later, my boy. Now is a time for action.*

*We approached the oncoming wave of superheated fire and he scooped me up in his arms, leaping higher and farther than I had ever seen him do before. The heat was intense for a moment  I closed my eyes to it and turned my face up instinctively. We landed a few feet behind it but grandfather just ran, not setting me down.*

*I can run, grandpa.*

*In a moment, he huffed. It is very hot here still.*

*Sweat was pouring off of him, both of our shirts drenched and clinging to our bodies, when he finally set me down. Move quickly. Do not let your feet stay still for even a moment. The ground is still very hot and will melt your shoes.*

*I nodded and followed him, jogging lightly toward the hole in the sky that I never noticed before. Fire seemed to drip from it like a slow leaking hose. As we got close enough to really inspect it the ground cooled and we slowed to a walk. Everything in the area had been burned and charred so badly the fire couldnt spread. It just dripped down and burned on a single spot directly below the hole, which looked just like the one we came from, green swirling light tinged with liquid fire.*

*Fire needs fuel, oxygen, and a source. But this is no ordinary fire. Give me your coat and step back.*

*I handed it over to him and watched him work. He stripped off his coat and thick flannel shirt, wearing only an undershirt and pants. He set to work tying them together into a thick rope and then looked at me. Stay here, no matter what. With that he flung one end of the shirt-rope up into the portal and it pulled him up and out of sight.*

*Several seconds later he came crashing down and rolled crazily in the dirt to put out any fire that may have clung to him during the fall. Is it fixed? Are you okay grandpa?!*

*Out of breath but smiling widely, he answered. All is well. I removed all the debris from around the portal and built a mound-moat around it to keep the napalm from spreading. I was right, it was a different time, during the war.*

*I was too confused to ask anything and too thankful that he was able solve the issue. I ran over and hugged him tightly. At some point Onion Man made his way over to us and ended the silence -*

*Is all well, travelers?*

*I believe so, Onion Man. Since I have come through the portal no more fire has followed. Your home should be safe. I beamed at his words. I helped save their world!*

*Oh, thank you, thank you! Please, I have one more request of you before you leave. He paused dramatically before continuing. Be respectful of your world. It is only when you destroy yours that ours seems to suffer.*

*Grandfather looked at me with strong, compassionate eyes. Do you promise to take care of the planet you live on, Aaron? I nodded emphatically and issued my promise. Yes, we promise.*

I stopped dead in my tracks. I cut down the trees  broke the covenant I made as a child. Grandpa. Was he safe? I had to get to him. The ground trembled and I turned in time to see a massive branch cross my vision. 

Rough slaps to both sides of my face brought me back to consciousness. I raised my lolling head to see my assailant standing before me. A massively built and horribly pungent onion loomed within arms reach flanked by a redwood and a squat palm tree. In one hand the Onion Man held a small jar with a familiar fire licking up the sides with a hungry intensity, in the other a wicked looking drill.

Remember me, boy?

<TEXT> 1992, I approach my grandfather in the backyard and ask him what he is doing. My grandfather is a kind and loving man, always taking the time to explain in as much or little detail as I ask. He sets his shovel aside and begins to teach me about gardening. Together we plant several rows of vegetables; tomatoes, onions, peppers, and cabbage, alongside the back fence which is chain-link. It will help them grow tall and strong, he said to me, like you will be one day.

That night I wiggled deep into the warm sheets in the guest room of their home and eagerly waited for the story to begin. Grandfather was an **incredible** storyteller, so much so that I usually spent the night at their house for the sole fact that Id hear a story at night. Tales of time-travel, massive underground gangs, fantastical creatures helping my sister and I save the world. I clung to those stories for many years after we got too old for bedtime stories and we would discuss them at length over lunch or through e-mail every so often. That night would begin the most epic of his stories  The Onion Man.

*Tap Tap Tap. In the cool and quiet night, the sound could be clearly heard. It was coming from the window. Quickly we gathered together and rushed outside to find the source of the disturbance, grandfather in the lead wielding a strong, wooden bat. After circling the home twice we could find no sign and so filled back to bed. In the morning we rose early to continue our work on the garden but found a large hole in the middle of the row of onions.* 

*One of the strays must have dug up the seeds, I complained.*

*I dont think so, take a closer look.*

*My grandfather always lets me try to figure things out for myself, albeit with a nudge in the right direction from time to time. I set the rake I was holding down and stepped carefully between the rows. He was right, of course. Only one of the mounds that we planted the day before was disturbed but the hole was enormous and deep.*

*What do you think did it, grandpa?*

*He squatted down to inspect the gaping hole closer, powerful mental wheels turning inside of his head. Lets eat breakfast and think on it.*

*And so we did.*

The time came for me to move out on my own and I started to get into science fiction shows and movies I started to see parallels to his stories, sometimes vague and other times incredibly similar in nature, so I asked if some of those shows were his inspiration. He admitted some were but about half of them were completely pulled from his beautifully creative brain. We have bonded tremendously over the years because of those stories. Anytime I see a movie or read a book I think hed like I call him up and tell him all about it, and visa versa. Once we have both seen or read it we talk about it  what we liked, didnt like, how we could have made it better. 

*Just like the night before I was roused from sleep by a soft but clear Tap Tap Tap. My grandfather was already out the door by the time my feet hit the floor and I followed him out, struggling to get my slippers on while pursuing him. He rushed to the left, towards my window, and I saw him dive forward. I approached cautiously, worried that whatever he was wrestling with would get free and attack me. Suddenly, the struggling stopped, and my grandfathers deep laugh filled the night air. In his hands was a squirming, shuddering onion with thin arms and thin legs.* 

*I am sorry to startle you, humans. But I need your help. Our world is under attack!*

Two years ago I purchased my first home. It is a fixer-upper on the edge of town on a fairly large corner lot. The home itself is shaded by half a dozen trees as old and ancient as they are tall. As beautiful and majestic as they all were some were dead or dying and dropping huge limbs all over the yard and roof. Fortunately, no damage had been done but it was only a matter of time before one strong wind knocks enough off to crush the house, maybe with me in it. I called a tree service company out for estimates and information on what each type of tree was and whether or not they were healthy. Much to my surprise they only recommended removing two which happened to be the biggest, tallest, and closest to the house. $2,500 for each tree. $5000! Just to drop two trees. 

My stubborn nature, can-do attitude, and complete lack of common sense told me that I could take care of them myself for far less. After all, I had never worked on a house before buying this one but Id been able to fix a lot of the plumbing and electrical issues in the house and even knocked a few walls down. I started looking up pricing for chain saws, ways to store firewood, and how to make a nice outdoor fire pit. After several hours of YouTube videos, a few trips to Home Depot and half a paycheck later I was ready! 

*I sat back on my heels with eyes wide and bulging. A talking onion?! Grandfather seemed to be unfazed, conversing with the little guy about the ongoing attack and what we could do to help.*

*Follow me, I will show you.*

*And with that, we walked to the backyard and watched the Onion Man drop down into the hole  a dim green light emanating from it. I stood just close enough to peer over the edge but saw nothing  just green swirling light. Grandfather was a practical man and a window cleaner. He grabbed a long, thick rope from his gear and tied it around our waists, then looped it around a large tree.*

*Are you ready for an adventure, my boy?*

I took a week off of work to ensure I had enough time to do things properly and not make stupid mistakes. I was able to drop the first tree just fine. It was a little off-mark from where I wanted it to land but all in all pretty easy. By the end of the second day, I had it chopped and stacked. I also had a major back ache! The second tree was closer to the house and much less room for error which is why I waited, using the first tree as practice and experience. After shooting up a quick prayer I revved the 36-inch chainsaw into action. The tree took a lot more precision cuts compared to the first one but after an hour I got it to the ground with a thunderous boom. My house was still standing and I was victorious! I circled the massive trunk to start making cuts into the stump when I was stopped by what I saw. 

There in the center, where a solid trunk marked by hundreds of rings should be, was a deep hollow emanating a green light. Memories came flooding to the forefront of my mind  hundreds of stories my grandfather told us as we laid in bed. I approached boldly and grasped the massive trunk with both hands to peer down into the gently swirling light. It was hard to focus on any one point, mesmerizing, hypnotizing were the swirls. I squinted and strained to see through the swirls but ended up getting queasy.

Clutching at my stomach I teetered backward and landed hard on my butt in the soft grass. Moaning in pain from two sore spots I turned over to hands and knees and eased my way inside the house. An hour later, with hot tea in hand, I lounged on the couch watching television. My butt was no longer sore however my stomach was still tied up in knots. Just standing fully erect was enough to double me over again and shoot spots across my vision. I dont know how long I struggled with my tea and the remote but eventually, an empty mug dropped from my hand and I dreamed about my childhood. 

Tap Tap Tap. 

My eyes blinked open. Was that a part of my dream? With slow deliberation, I swung my legs down and gingerly rubbed my stiff neck. My phone light up at a touch and revealed the time  10:18 PM. Crap, my sleep schedule was going to be way off. I began making my way to the fridge to grab something to eat when I noticed my stomach had finally settled. Good, I can get back to work tomorrow. The cool air felt amazing on my face, eyes scanning for something quick and easy.

Tap Tap Tap.

I spun toward the sound. Definitely not a dream. I pushed the fridge door closed and stalked to the patio doors and flicked the light switch up. Soft yellow light removed the darkness in a thirty-foot semi-circle, just shy of the stump. I could easily make out the strange green light in the darkness  swirling up and out like a fog machine at a concert. With a twist of my wrist, the door was unlocked and sliding open. I stepped out and made my way towards it but skittering behind me made me pause. Raccoon? Opossum? Something bigger? 

The stiffness in my neck hadnt faded so I pivoted with my hips but saw nothing. Then, out of the corner of my eye, movement at the stump. I turned and moved forward in one fluid motion hoping to close the distance on whatever was out here when two powerful hands latched on to my shoulders and lifted me up and off the ground. 

I tried to break free, to turn and see what held me so tightly, but each movement was met with more resistance. My body was on the verge of breaking  the stump drew closer and the light shone brighter. Without warning, I was flipped 180 degrees with my feet in the air and my head dangerously close to the rough bark. I caught a brief glimpse of powerfully built legs and the overwhelming smell of onions before my head broke the plain of green light and everything went black.

<TITLE> The Onion Man </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1992, I approach my grandfather in the backyard and ask him what he is doing. My grandfather is a kind and loving man, always taking the time to explain in as much or little detail as I ask. He sets his shovel aside and begins to teach me about gardening. Together we plant several rows of vegetables; tomatoes, onions, peppers, and cabbage, alongside the back fence which is chain-link. It will help them grow tall and strong, he said to me, like you will be one day.

That night I wiggled deep into the warm sheets in the guest room of their home and eagerly waited for the story to begin. Grandfather was an **incredible** storyteller, so much so that I usually spent the night at their house for the sole fact that Id hear a story at night. Tales of time-travel, massive underground gangs, fantastical creatures helping my sister and I save the world. I clung to those stories for many years after we got too old for bedtime stories and we would discuss them at length over lunch or through e-mail every so often. That night would begin the most epic of his stories  The Onion Man.

*Tap Tap Tap. In the cool and quiet night, the sound could be clearly heard. It was coming from the window. Quickly we gathered together and rushed outside to find the source of the disturbance, grandfather in the lead wielding a strong, wooden bat. After circling the home twice we could find no sign and so filled back to bed. In the morning we rose early to continue our work on the garden but found a large hole in the middle of the row of onions.* 

*One of the strays must have dug up the seeds, I complained.*

*I dont think so, take a closer look.*

*My grandfather always lets me try to figure things out for myself, albeit with a nudge in the right direction from time to time. I set the rake I was holding down and stepped carefully between the rows. He was right, of course. Only one of the mounds that we planted the day before was disturbed but the hole was enormous and deep.*

*What do you think did it, grandpa?*

*He squatted down to inspect the gaping hole closer, powerful mental wheels turning inside of his head. Lets eat breakfast and think on it.*

*And so we did.*

The time came for me to move out on my own and I started to get into science fiction shows and movies I started to see parallels to his stories, sometimes vague and other times incredibly similar in nature, so I asked if some of those shows were his inspiration.

<TEXT> I always wanted to be a father, as far back as I can remember, probably starting with when my younger sister was born. Being an older brother was a lot of fun and I must have translated that into being a dad will be fun. I probably scared off a lot of girlfriends early on with all my talk of being a dad someday but that is fine, they clearly didnt have what it takes! 

When I met my now-wife, then-girlfriend we clicked immediately and I wasnt even the first one to mention babies which was a first. She was just as excited about being a mother as I was at being a father. Match made in heaven! We didnt date long, just seven weeks, we were so eager to start a family. That was eleven years ago, eleven childless years. It turns out that enthusiasm isnt the only thing you need to have children. High sperm count, active sperm, an inviting cervix, and many other factors are involved, all of which we addressed one by one, even going out on a limb and doing new and provocative methods in other countries that werent legal here in the US. 

After a few years we slowly began to lose hope and in turn the relationship suffered. I dont like thinking back to that time as I am not proud of who I was but we managed to get past it; renewing old bonds, creating new ones, founding a new set of passions and in time came to peace with our childless home. The would-be nursey became a home office, the larger spare bedroom reserved for later years a home gym. We took trips to faraway places, became fitness freaks, tried to learn pottery and painting. And then one day it happened  a beautiful little boy began to take form inside of my wife. We are still not sure why or how but of course we were thrilled! We joke that it was the wine in France. He was our miracle baby. 

The home was a buzz almost immediately. I ordered dozens of books for dads, moms, how to care for the baby in the womb, the fourth trimester, you name it I probably ordered and read it. My basement quickly turned into an office and gym, paint went flying, Buy Buy Baby stock increased 18% in a months time - they knew us by name at the local store. Have you ever been in one of those stores? It is *insane*. They have a product for every single possible scenario you could ever encounter. And none of it is cheap. 

Finally, 276 days later, a curly-haired little prune cried for the first time and a permanent smile was fixed to my face. Isaac was perfect, our family was perfect. The two days in the hospital went pretty quick. There was lots of crying and sleeplessness, although the food was much better than everyone makes it out to be. We made our way home ever so slowly in our new minivan (I traded in my 12 Audi TT) and settled in. A few weeks went by without a hitch, like I said, Isaac was perfect. He rarely cried, feeds regularly, and sleeps half of the night already. 

I was back at work in the middle of a presentation when I received an urgent phone call from my wife. To paraphrase the strange phone call, she was cleaning up the kitchen after lunch and her water broke. You can imagine my surprise at that considering we just had a baby. Looking back on it now I suppose it was odd that over those few weeks her mid-section never lessened in size, but hindsight is 20/20. I rushed home and helped her and Isaac to the hospital to get checked out. Maybe her water never broke during the delivery so it was delayed? Was that a thing? The nurse did a few quick checks and left the room for what seemed like hours. When she came back my wifes OB/GYN was with her. She looked perplexed to say the least and asked my wife to lay back on the table so she could perform an ultrasound. As soon as the transducer hit her belly a strong, quick heart-beat greeted us and everyone in the room gasped. 

Twins? But how could they have missed a second child for so long? And why didnt she just deliver both at the same time? What the hell was it doing hanging out in there for three weeks? Questions were flying around the room but were interrupted with a scream from my wife  contractions. We were transferred up into the Labor and Delivery department and eight hours later we were proud parents of a second child  Isabella.

Unfortunately because of the back-to-back nature of the deliveries my wifes body was wrecked and worn out. She bled a lot during the second because stitches from the first were not fully healed and each one re-opened. We were grateful, of course, to be parents to a boy and now a girl. Our family was complete  the perfect model family. A longer stay was necessary but five days went fast with two newborns on your hands and soon we were back home and I was re-painting half of the nursery a soft coral color. My work granted me three more weeks off given the circumstances and boy was it ever needed. I probably slept a total of 60 hours during that time! The things you do for your family, right? 

A nurse visited our home once a week to check in on her, probably because of the crazy situation. No one had ever heard of that happening before. The day after our last in-home nurse visit her water broke again. This time I was home when it happened and before we could even get to the hospital I had to pull over on the side of the road and rush around to her side to help catch the baby girl that was so eager to come out into the world. An ambulance met us at our car to assist because she was bleeding out and fainted from the pain. One pregnancy is extremely hard on a womans body, let alone three in the course of three months. We just arent made for that! A whole team of doctors and specialists took interest in our case and began to try and solve the mystery behind it. 

That was eight months ago. 

My wife died during the fourth incident, each one exactly three weeks apart, each one a perfectly healthy and strong baby. Each one looks slightly different but clearly our children. I have stopped calling the hospital, what is the point? They never figured out the cause. I set up a special delivery bed in the guest room for her, legs permanently strapped to the raised stirrups. Every three weeks another child emerges. I have no idea how long this will last. I had to pull the last one out because her body has wasted away to such a degree that she has no musculature left. I am afraid if I am not here for the next one it will suffocate and died inside of her. Would that stop things? Maybe. Maybe the next one will just push out the dead one. Or they will get backed up and explode. I dont know, I am going crazy. Trying to take care of eleven babies? Maybe there are more, I cant really think right now. Her milk ran out a long time ago so Ive tried to keep up with formula but it is so expensive! I wonder if I bought a goat and milked it. Who am I kidding, I dont have time to milk a goat. 

Whos crying? Isaac, stop that! I swear, I am going insane.

<TITLE> The Imposter - 2 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-25 21:18:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Imposter. Stranger. Doppelganger. Changeling. Shapeshifter. I have been called many names over the centuries. Who I am is not a valid question because I am many. *What I am* is a much better question and one that I will do my best to describe to you in terms you might understand. 

If memory serves me right, and it almost always does, I was created sometime in the 5th Century. A grieving woman, desperate for her husband to return to her, called upon a power she did not fully understand and could not control. She received her husband back, of course, but he was me. Maybe created is the wrong word because I already existed but I had yet to be given a purpose. I floated along the Breeze of Time until that night when I was Summoned and given a body to inhabit. From that point on I have lived in your realm in various bodies, enjoying life after life. 

When a body loses its ability to live I drift out and once again enter the Breeze of Time until another summons. Naturally, once I had a taste of life as a human I wanted more. I had developed a desire for life and the sweet tastes that come along with it  emotion, desire, needs, even lusts. I grew impatient waiting for the next summoning, something I never dealt with before. Ignorance truly is bliss. Over a century of counting the milliseconds passed before I had another opportunity to indulge in the human realm. 

She was a pretty little thing, the woman I entered, for human standards. Love-sick suicide. Her grief-filled boyfriend unintelligibly offered his life for hers which I was most thankful for. Public service announcement, dont be so brash and careless with your words  someone is *always* listening. Instead of simply enjoying life as I had done previously I spent time learning about your race, absorbing your tendencies and weaknesses and storing away as much information as I could. As my borrowed life came to an end I explored ways in which I could extend it but alas I ran out of time. 

Fortunately for me this was the period you call the Dark Ages and I was not without opportunity. I skipped from body to body and experienced a vast smorgasbord (Oh how I love that word) of people, places, cultures, and witnessed many a secret. Within a few decades I had bounced between a dozen or more individuals thanks to outlandish religious beliefs and short lifespans. I knew it wouldnt last that way forever and therefore I needed to figure out how to stay for good. The Breeze of Time sounds beautiful and all but it is empty, Time itself is nothing except what you make of it, and so I sought out a means to stay.

I am sure that you have heard the expression It is not what you know but who you know and it is spot on. I spent life after life trying to get closer to the great minds of the era and learn from them, or become them if possible. Tesla was crucial for me. The knowledge that man had stored away was incredible! During my short time within him I learned the secret of how to jump from person to person instead of waiting for a Summons. It was at that point I could *choose* my next life and if manipulated properly I could then steer that man or woman into allowing me in. I never had to travel along the Breeze again! 

Something else I should note is that once I am a part of someone I become them and they become me. When they would die and I would return to the Breeze of Time their memories departed with me. After sixteen centuries of focused learning you could say I am the smartest man alive. Or woman, depending on who I choose, I dont discriminate. That brings us to the here and now, the point where my hard work, patience, experience, and knowledge pay dividends  finally freeing myself of these shackles.

Two days ago I found an amateur author, tired and desperate. He was bogged down with life and in his lowest point he uttered the words I so desperately needed to hear  he was mine. I drifted into his body and watched his shadowy essence depart, lost and confused. It swirled and circled for a time before an open window pulled it out. 

Last night as I went about my new daily routine I encountered something new, something disconcerting. The shadow returned, and it watched. What is perhaps even more damaging is that his daughter, my daughter, seems to recognize me for what I am, or what I am not.

You may be asking yourself a question right now, something along the lines of What the hell does this Imposter need from a crappy author?  It just so happens that this author knows things, as a matter of fact the *only one* to know one particular fact  where is Harrison Matherson hiding? 

When he killed me I was forced out of a body I had been in a long time, one I had planned on staying in forever. And now that has been taken from me! However, I will find Harrison and I will take his body. It is almost as good as the one he stole from me.

<TEXT> [Imposter](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/67b19w/the_imposter/). Stranger. Doppelganger. Changeling. Shapeshifter. I have been called many names over the centuries. Who I am is not a valid question because I am many. *What I am* is a much better question and one that I will do my best to describe to you in terms you might understand. 

If memory serves me right, and it almost always does, I was created sometime in the 5th Century. A grieving woman, desperate for her husband to return to her, called upon a power she did not fully understand and could not control. She received her husband back, of course, but he was me. Maybe created is the wrong word because I already existed but I had yet to be given a purpose. I floated along the Breeze of Time until that night when I was Summoned and given a body to inhabit. From that point on I have lived in your realm in various bodies, enjoying life after life. 

When a body loses its ability to live I drift out and once again enter the Breeze of Time until another summons. Naturally, once I had a taste of life as a human I wanted more. I had developed a desire for life and the sweet tastes that come along with it  emotion, desire, needs, even lusts. I grew impatient waiting for the next summoning, something I never dealt with before. Ignorance truly is bliss. Over a century of counting the milliseconds passed before I had another opportunity to indulge in the human realm. 

She was a pretty little thing, the woman I entered, for human standards. Love-sick suicide. Her grief-filled boyfriend unintelligibly offered his life for hers which I was most thankful for. Public service announcement, dont be so brash and careless with your words  someone is *always* listening. Instead of simply enjoying life as I had done previously I spent time learning about your race, absorbing your tendencies and weaknesses and storing away as much information as I could. As my borrowed life came to an end I explored ways in which I could extend it but alas I ran out of time. 

Fortunately for me this was the period you call the Dark Ages and I was not without opportunity. I skipped from body to body and experienced a vast smorgasbord (Oh how I love that word) of people, places, cultures, and witnessed many a secret. Within a few decades I had bounced between a dozen or more individuals thanks to outlandish religious beliefs and short lifespans. I knew it wouldnt last that way forever and therefore I needed to figure out how to stay for good. The Breeze of Time sounds beautiful and all but it is empty, Time itself is nothing except what you make of it, and so I sought out a means to stay.

I am sure that you have heard the expression It is not what you know but who you know and it is spot on. I spent life after life trying to get closer to the great minds of the era and learn from them, or become them if possible. Tesla was crucial for me. The knowledge that man had stored away was incredible! During my short time within him I learned the secret of how to jump from person to person instead of waiting for a Summons. It was at that point I could *choose* my next life and if manipulated properly I could then steer that man or woman into allowing me in. I never had to travel along the Breeze again! 

Something else I should note is that once I am a part of someone I become them and they become me. When they would die and I would return to the Breeze of Time their memories departed with me. After sixteen centuries of focused learning you could say I am the smartest man alive. Or woman, depending on who I choose, I dont discriminate. That brings us to the here and now, the point where my hard work, patience, experience, and knowledge pay dividends  finally freeing myself of these shackles.

Two days ago I found an amateur author, tired and desperate. He was bogged down with life and in his lowest point he uttered the words I so desperately needed to hear  he was mine. I drifted into his body and watched his shadowy essence depart, lost and confused. It swirled and circled for a time before an open window pulled it out. 

Last night as I went about my new daily routine I encountered something new, something disconcerting. The shadow returned, and it watched. What is perhaps even more damaging is that his daughter, my daughter, seems to recognize me for what I am, or what I am not. That is a bridge I will cross when I must but for now I need to be rid of his shadow. For those that do not know a shadow, or shade, or ghost, depending on who you ask, is his corporeal essence. Because he did not actually die the Breeze of Time is not calling to him and because he no longer has his body he is stuck, for lack of a better word. I need to get him unstuck, and fast. If not, and this is only conjecture because it is the first time I have tried this kind of trade, is that he will try to return to his body and his body will be destroyed from being pulled in two directions. Granted, I dont foresee needing his body very long so maybe it wont be an issue after all.

<TEXT> In his state he would do anything, so yes that would fit. If it were my story I would keep everything you have the same but insert a gruesome and wrath-filled Tarentino styled torture of the other driver and act like it was no big deal. Then kill himself after to meet up with his mom. 

Or maybe his mom is actually not dead but in a coma and he is so stricken with grief that it seems like she is dead. He kills himself and at that moment she rises up from the hospital bed. 

Orrrrrr twist it so that *he is the driver that killed her* but we don't find out until the end after he blames others around him and alienates himself into oblivion.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bright red and blue lights pulsed on and off through my blinds, diluted slightly by my drapes, and startled me out of a deep sleep. I glanced at my phone  3:29AM. With a groan and a sigh I rolled over and proper myself up enough to peek out the window. I already knew what was going on but I had to be sure. Yup, another break-in. The fourth one this week! Police officers were spread out on the lawn talking amongst themselves and the family who lived there. Others canvassed the surrounding area and more still were searching the home for clues they wouldnt find. 

Over the past three months our city has been hit hard with a wave of burglaries of historical proportions. Every single day I see something else on the news about the Fingerless Bandits and every day it is the same story  no evidence was found, nothing has been recovered, authorities are stumped. The only leads they have are that they break in at night and only break into homes without security systems, which is why my wife has been hounding me to call up a company and have one installed. Groaning inwardly this time I know what Ill hear all day long because of another neighbor getting hit up. 

Ive put it off so far for several reasons, one being that we really dont have anything to take. Most of our furniture are used hand-me-downs from friends or family, our TV is old and only 720P resolution and weighs far more than seems possible. Money is another concern. Alarm systems arent cheap and we really dont have the room in our budget for another monthly bill. But me, being the thrifty and practical guy that I am, was able to get some window stickers and a lawn sign from a neighbor so that people *think* we have a system. It works with Beware of Dog signs doesnt it? 

After watching for a few more moments I settled back into my warm sheets and drifted into a dreamless sleep for what seemed like only a few minutes when my alarm buzzed and beeped me back to reality. I begrudgingly went about my day: drive to work, grab a donut at Nancys desk, type furiously for eight hours, eat somewhere along the way, and drive home. Sure enough my wife was glued to the local news and bombarded me as soon as I walked in the door.

You know those signs wont last forever. They watch the neighborhood and follow the install trucks. Theyll know we dont have a system!

My eyes would have rolled right out of my head if I hadnt closed them. Hunnie, I told you we cant afford a system and you need to stop being paranoid. I bent to untie my shoes before stepping off of the rubber mat.

It isnt just about stuff getting stolen! It is about our safety, my safety! You are gone all the time at work and here I am all by myself looking after our daughter without any protection! She ran forward and sobbed heavily into my chest. Hazel, our daughter, poked her head out from her nursery and did her best impression of walking over to us to tug on our legs. Wrong?

I let her get it all out before lifting her chin up and wiping the tears away and kissing her. I promise it will be okay. You just have to trust me. I bent down and scooped up my little girl, giving her a reassuring hug. Nothing is wrong Hazelnut. Show daddy your sign? 

Let me back up here for a minute. My wife grew up in the deaf community because her parents are deaf so her first language was actually American Sign Language, or ASL. With second languages being important these days we decided our daughter should know sign language as well. I know a little but Ive never had the time to devote to it like I should so my daughter probably knows more than I do. Every day I come home and she shows me all of the signs she knows and the animal sounds and the colors and just about anything else she thinks is worth mentioning. Kids are cute. 

------------

For a second night in a row I was disturbed from sleep  this time by a feeling. It is amazing how our body works, dead asleep but yet our senses still detecting everything around us, snapping into action when necessary by way of coursing adrenaline. I could heart my heartbeat in my ears and feel it against my ribs while easing my body soundlessly out of my bed. I pushed my feet into my slippers and grabbed the solid-core pipe from under the bed. A few silent steps later brought me into the living room, and then the nursery.

She was fussing quite a bit in her crib and most likely what woke me up. To be on the safe side I made the rounds through the other few rooms before returning to my daughter to see what she needed. It turns out chugging a sippie cup of milk right before bed isnt the best plan of action for a fourteen month old to take  her diaper was HUGE.

Careful not to wake her up too much I gently laid her down on the changing table and set to work getting her comfortable again. You know how you do something so often that you dont really think about it? Your eyes are working but you arent taking any information in, your hands move but you dont remember where they went or what they did. I was in that kind of zone when my eyes finally recognized my daughter signing something. It was a sign I had only seen before once so at first I thought she was just wiggling her arms (she is a very active kid) but when she did it over and over I knew but I had no idea how she had learned it  *imposter*.

I was going to ask my wife in the morning but I noticed Hazels eyes staring at the window behind me, unwavering. I turned to follow her gaze and caught someone moving quickly away from the window. She started crying and although I did everything I could I couldnt get her settled back down. My wife came in after a bit and took over so I could get some sleep. I didnt tell her about the incident because I didnt want to scare her but I knew I would have to do something about it. I cant having him come around anymore, especially since Hazel knows that I am an Imposter. Maybe a security system would be good after all. But what to do with her?

<TITLE> You must Die in order to Live </TITLE>

<TEXT> Have you ever wondered what it feels like to die? Is it painful when your body lets go of its last stores of energy? Are you aware that you are dying or do you think it will pass? Maybe you are one of the many that have thought it great to never be *able* to die. Like a superhero. Saving beautiful women from horrible men and little children from burning houses. Oh yes, that would be nice.

Now lets imagine you are walking up some stairs. The damned elevator is broken again and you have to trudge up five flights to get to your office building. Step up, step up, step up. After two flights you are a little winded perhaps, maybe you take your phone out and check e-mails to save time. That is when your foot catches the stop of a riser and for a split second you panic. Your heart races, your blood flowing fiercely through your body which causes your body temperature rises significantly and you break out into a sweat. In the next moment your foot finds the step and your panic recedes although you feel a little sheepish and hope no one witnessed the miscue. A few stairs later and your face is no longer flushed with the excess blood, your heart has returned to a normal rhythm, and all is right with the world. You may tread a little more carefully for the next minute or so, maybe even putting your phone back into your pocket or purse, and you forget about that moment in time.

These are all normal responses for a normal human being. Your body senses danger, your balance is thrown off and your mind knows the great distance you could fall should you go backwards. All normal. But what if I told you that **everything** caused your body to react that way. Every properly executed step. Every change in the winds direction. Every noise your ears perceive and every flash of color taken in by your retinas. What if your body could not differential between normal interactions with the world around you and emergency situations? I suppose, then, you would be me. 

My mother told me once that all I ever did was cry for the first few years of life. She couldnt understand it, the doctors couldnt understand it. Pain, the doctors told her. He is always in pain. There was nothing they could do because they couldnt find the cause. The only indication they had was my heart  it constantly revved up like I was in pain and then stopped very briefly before resuming a normal beat. She had raised four children already and knew exactly what each needed based on their cry, except for mine. It didnt take long for her to stop taking me places and pretty soon I was left alone in a dark room with the door closed and a primitive baby monitor keeping me company. 

I was small and weak, physically and mentally. Going outside for even a moment was enough to send me into shock. But I survived. I kept on going. As I grew up and my capacity for communication increased I was able to relate more of what I was going through with my mother and doctors. Unfortunately it was far too late for any real help or hope. The debt of constant hospital visits and specialists crippled my mother. My father only lasted a few weeks before giving up and leaving us. I told my mom to stop looking for a cure and focus on my brothers and sister, and thankfully she did.

I spent the next fifteen years by myself for the most part, except for those my laptop connected me to. School was out of the question so I enrolled in online learning that was an at-your-own-pace style. It was hard considering just touching the mouse or clacking on the keyboard sent my heart racing and stopping suddenly, mind crashing into mental walls of anguish and blinding light overtaking all of my senses. It is hard to describe but it was as if I tasted more than I could handle, heard more than I could process, smell so much I became clogged, felt every molecule colliding with my body, see so clearly the spectrum of visible light separated for me for a split second. It was so overwhelming every time. But I kept going. I survived. The episodes slowly grew worse, longer, harder to handle. I had to do something but I no longer had doctor visits or specialists calling the house or coming by to see if they could figure things out. I was on my own armed with the internet and a determination to prevail. 

Fast forward to today as I speak this aloud for my computer to transcribe. I have my answer, my cure. Death. As you are probably aware there is some very taboo stuff on the internet and as a person who literally spends his every waking moment online I have stumbled across a lot of it. I began studying death more deeply some time ago and it intrigued me. Something about it seemed so familiar but I wasnt sure why. I studied what death was, how people died, what religions thought about it, what people with near-death experiences describe. It slowly became clear to me that I was dying. With every touch, sound, blink of an eye I died. And came back. Again and again and again. Eventually my heart wont be able to take the constant trauma and I will die for good unless I can find enough *helpers*.

As I said I found a cure, but it isnt an easy one to obtain and I happened upon it by accident. Yesterday I was determined to make another attempt at outside for research and to see the world. This would make my fourth visit that I can remember to the world outside of my home. Wearing special sunglasses that block out almost all of the light and noise-cancelling headphones I took it very slow, my powerchair cruising at the slowest speed. I had died twelve times by the time I made it to the end of my driveway. Glancing up ever so slightly to one side and the next I made sure the road was clear and began the slow crossing. As I crossed the yellow line in the middle of the road I heard the loudest sound Id ever witnessed, dying for twentieth time. When I came back to myself I could feel the heat of the car crash a ways down the road, hear the screams of those inside the car and those running to help. I died nine more times trying to get away as fast as I could before the car exploded. 

Seven people died that day because of me. Four in the car and three who attempted to rescue them from the car before it blew. I could feel the blast on my neck as I powered away at a brisk 3 miles per hour. But I didnt die. Not that time. In fact I made it all the way back inside my home before I succumbed to another instance of my malady, caused by the high-pitched sirens of emergency vehicles arriving on the scene. 

I was filled with fear, filled with hope. It was time to [experiment..](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5px61m/helpers/)

<TITLE> The City of Etzanoa </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-21 15:40:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Some of you, especially if you live in the Midwest, know about Etzanoa. For those that dont Ill give a brief account of the city and its people. Several hundred years ago the Native Americans rules this continent. For the most part they were tribal and nomadic with free reign to move about as the seasons dictated. However, there were exceptions to this with large, permanent settlements such as Cahokia and Etzanoa supporting upwards of 20,000 people.

As history and legend have it Juan de Onate and seventy soldiers discovered a sprawling settlement of Wichita Indians poised between two rivers. When the Indians saw the Spaniards they fled and left their city. Once inside Onate explored the city and the size of the city alone unnerved them so much that they turned and retreated only to find a rival tribe coming in behind them. Onate stated that the rival tribe was surprised at their presence, indicating that they were actually there to attack Etzanoa. The Spaniards hunkered down and fired cannonballs out into the surrounding area hoping to scare off the warriors, which they eventually did. 

Why is this relevant, you might be asking yourself? For the past two years I have been working on site in Arkansas City, Kansas with a small team of student archeologists and Donald Blankeslee at the head. During that time we have uncovered undeniable evidence of the once-thought impossible city. What you will find in the news is that Blankeslee has confirmed the tale of Onate and his battle near a massive city. Cannonballs have been recovered, tons of flint objects, pottery, tools, and remains of building structures including a fully operational water shrine. 

Some of that is true, but mostly misinformation. Yes, the city existed, yes the Spanish were there, and yes we found a shrine. That is where the similarities stop. What we actually found was five times the size! Twenty five miles of Indian metropolis stretching as far as you can see in all directions. They completely dominated the area between the rivers and the surrounding hills in a manner never seen before. What I found to be the most surprising is that we found no walls, no battlements, no defense systems whatsoever. It was as if they had nothing to fear at all.

In the exact center of the city is a beautiful and ornate shrine designed with incredible skill and intricacy. At what would have been the highest point in the city stood six columns, four at each corner most likely supporting an open roof to allow the sun and moonlight to pierce through, and two smaller columns spaced four feet apart adorned with massive chains. The floor resembled a pyramid, sloping gently away from the center and opening to four aqueducts at the edge of the platform on which the columns stood. These aqueducts branched over and over as they moved down and spread to a trough that circled the shrine at its base. If you are having trouble visualizing it I could sketch something quickly but Im not an artist so it probably wont help.

The aqueducts were fashioned out of gold and each side of the shrine had its own design. It was clear this was not just a water shrine but one of sacrifice and service to a god or multiple gods. The sun god, moon god, harvest god? After weeks of studying the sides of the shrine I realized each one was a symbol and therefore must have meaning. We poured over every text and book we could get our hands on and finally found what each of the symbols means. Blood. Protection. Monster. Annual. It reminded me of the movie King Kong where they sacrifice someone to the giant gorilla in exchange for peace or for general worship.

Along the base of the shrine we also found several mounds which ended up being hundreds of skulls. In total we counted over one thousand individual skulls. What was interesting and horrifying was the condition of the skulls  they were all completely intact without blemish or any sign of damage and they were all from children. I truly believe these skulls are the remains of each sacrifice, which means if it truly was only a once per year ritual that these people lived here over one thousand years giving up their children to appease the gods. 

That really got me to thinking. Why would the Wichita turn and flee from a few Spanish if they were so numerous? They clearly ruled the land and feared nothing so even a few cannons should not have stopped them from decimating Onate and his men. And why would a rival tribe sent only a few hundred men to attack Etzanoa in the first place? Something was not adding up and I wanted to figure it out. As more and more of the ruins were uncovered we started to see a pattern in the homes and other buildings  it resembled Pompeii! Whole families huddled together arms locked across shoulders to protect the young which crouched inside. Each and every skeleton was missing the head.

It was a bone-chilling sight as we went from room to room finding only headless corpses all in the same position. I couldnt help but feel like I was being watched, but more than that, being judged, as I passed from hut to hut. I didnt stay down there long. A fear kept bubbling inside of me that I couldnt shake and after about fifteen huts I quickly made my way back to the surface and fresh air. Before the fear drove me out of that valley of death I did notice one other thing in each home  the symbol for Monster. 

Small, precise, and painstakingly burned into each of the main entryways was the symbol. Protection? Maybe. Reverence? Possibly. But maybe something even worse than that. A mark, made by the monster itself as it passed through each home. You see, I think that their protection ran out. Maybe they had no more children to sacrifice but that seems unlikely due to the size of the place. 

Want to know what I think? I think the Spanish interrupted the ceremony and angered the Monster/god to such an extent that it ravaged the land and all those in its path. I think Onate fled at the first sign of trouble and ran into a tribe on their way to the ritual and while they battled it out in order to flee the entire city of Etzanoa suffered the wrath of their once-protector  the Wendigo. 

That is why youll never hear about any of these details being found. I dont know if Blankeslee is being silenced or if he is working for someone in order to keep it silent. I want to know what else they uncover but I dont want to go back there, I dont feel safe. Almost as if it is still nearby, watching and waiting for the next ritual.

<TITLE> Anisometropia </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-21 15:38:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Three quarters of American adults use some type of corrective eyewear. Can you believe that? I can because I have worn glasses my entire life. Granted it was eye-patches as a baby but glasses from as long as I can remember. Optometrists tell you all kinds of statistics during the exams and I have been to hundreds so my head is full of useless knowledge about eyes. How they work, common issues, you name it. 

I have the unfortunate fate of falling into a particularly rare issue, or rather, block of issues that culminated into two incredibly useless eyes. I was born with extreme anisometropia and aniseikonia which resulted in astigmatism and amblyopia. What that means is that one eye is incredibly near-sighted while the other is incredibly far-sighted. Usually eyes will work together but mine fight each other causing my brain to pick one image over the other. After almost two decades my brain has finally figured out how to use one eye or the other without fighting as much so depending on what I am looking at the depth of that object determines which eye snaps into focus. This means that one eye is constantly rolling around doing nothing until its turn to focus.

Sometimes surgery will correct it but the five that I have had so far havent done too much. They kept me from going blind, sure, but not much else. Doctors have tried everything but they are at the edge of technology and unless another breakthrough occurs me and my eyes are out of luck. I tell you all of this because I think I see things others do not. I can hear the jokes now so save them. *The practically blind guy sees things we cant? Pshhh* Trust me when I say you dont want to see the things I see. 

I am not certain whether or not I have always seen them and not noticed or if this is something new, a side-effect of the latest surgery maybe. All my life I have had incredible peripheral vision  the one benefit of having endlessly wandering eyes. Even though they are not entirely focused on it I do pick up on things off to the sides that others would not normally see and then can turn to focus my eyes on them. They has saved me many a time from the vicious bullies throughout my school years trying to sneak up behind me. You can probably imagine the endless torment I have received with literal googley-eyes-syndrome as my wonderful contemporaries like to call me. But now the one positive factor I have had about all of this is betraying me. 

During one of the latest run-ins with a group of jerks I thought I saw a slap coming from the left side so I threw a hand up and flinched away to the right, directly into the slap that actually came from that side. My head rang and my cheek was instantly streaked with tears (I have over-active tear ducts as well) and my ears were filled with harsh, barking laughter from all around me. I guess the psychic is losing his touch! HAHAHAHAHA! Crying from one little slap? Baby bitch! Normally I would stand up for myself, even fight back at times, but not today. My mind was trying to grasp what I had thought I had seen to the left. It was a fast moving blur. What was it? I looked around past the ring of future societal rejects in a vain attempt to track down what could have caused it. 

Pushing past them I stayed vigilant on my way to class hoping to see it again. I am not sure why I was so obsessed with the blur but something about it nagged at me, agitated me. I tried to pay attention all through anatomy class (it was actually my favorite subject) but I kept getting distracted by flitting images at the edge of my periphery. Normally I wouldnt be bothered by this, I am used to it after all, but today it was different. They were different. 

How can I describe it? Have you even been poked in the eye and your vision is blurry? You can make out shapes and colors and maybe because you are familiar with your surroundings you even know what it is you are looking at despite the blur and tears obscuring your view. That is what these were like except everything around them was clear. Like oil in water, they only disturbed the space they took up and nothing more. And, just like oil in water, they didnt belong. I was sure of that more than I was sure of anything else. 

------------------

That was three weeks ago. 

I havent gone out much because it has become much worse. I see them more and more, yet I dont see them. No matter how fast I turn, no matter how much I anticipate their movements I cant catch them. But I think they are getting closer  a horrible ink blot moving sinuously through the air. They seem to take up more of my periphery whereas before it was just a flicker in the far corner. How they are closer yet impossible to see I still dont know. 

Something else, something new, I can see them at night. Even in the deepest recesses of shadow they undulate and defy my vision. They are a different kind of darkness, darker than the absence of light? How?

I sit here in bed with my phone as dim as possible in order to perform tests. As I type this out they draw nearer. When I raise the brightness to the maximum they draw nearer. The only thing I can do is turn to look. Then, and only then, do they vanish. But what if the next time I turn they dont?

I gave my eyes a rest and I can see them still, clearer, closer, taking up more of my field of view. What do they want? I used to get respite when I turned my head. Now I push them closer to the center. 

Eyes closed. Dont look, dont stare. 

LOOK! Open your eyes! 

They are in my eyes. Insideeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

-------------

I can see your future - You dont have much time. If you start to see them dont look, dont acknowledge them. It might give you more time.

<TITLE> I Hate Saturdays </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-21 15:36:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A shrill beeping startled me into consciousness and I blinked against the harsh overhead lights. A horrible chemical taste filled my mouth and as I brought my hands up to rub at my puffy eyes they quickly halted and pain shot up my arms. Cold metal dug mercilessly into my wrists, catching my full attention and snapping me immediately out of the post-sleep stupor. It must be Saturday again.

My wife shuffled over to the oven and pressed a few buttons, ending the beeping and letting out a wave of heat as she reached inside and pulled out a dish. My stomach gurgled and turned at the smell and the thought of what was about to happen once again. How did I let her get me again? I needed to stop letting my guard down.

"Time for dinner, hunnie!" Her chipper voice and gently swaying hips made it all the worse. How could she?!

A full plate was placed in front of me, assaulting my eyes and nose with the horrible stench and repulsive sight of what was about to be forced into my body. "Please don't" I pleaded, "I wasn't raised like you.... I can't eat that shit!"

I fought hard against the handcuffs but my arms were crossed and cuffed individually to the chair. My feet were constrained in a similar manner but to the table legs which were strong and sturdy. I had managed to break free the first night but there was no escaping this. My legs were stretched out in front of me so that I could not get purchase to stand and my arms tight behind me. I tried rolling to the side but only lost skin on my ankles and quickly came back to the center of my prison. 

A loving smile never left her face as she sliced through the viscera before me and soon had a perfect fork-full, moving steadily toward me. I clenched my jaw and pressed my tongue as hard as I could against the backs of my teeth in an attempt to keep it out. I could feel it rubbing against my thin-set lips.

"Open up or we will do this the hard way."

I took one look at the fork, then stole a glance her way. I knew she wasn't bluffing but I couldn't willingly open my mouth. She sighed and set the fork down, reaching for the harness she made that fit into my nose and around my neck. I threw my head back and forth and tried to snap at her hands but eventually, she had it around my head and the plugs pushed up into my nostrils.

A small amount of oxygen made it past the plastic and cloth but not enough. Soon my lungs were burning and I chanced a small breath through pressed teeth. Her hand was swift, slapping at my Adam's apple and I gagged, gasping for air. The fork found its way inside before I could blink and my stomach turned once again. 

Just being on my tongue sent tears streaming down my cheeks and my gag reflex increased to a code red. The little piece slid around on my tongue no matter how still I tried to be. The texture of it alone was enough to loosen the snot in my nose and it began to run down and around the plugs. Soon my beard was full of snot and salty tears.

"You have nine more pieces to go so you better hurry up. You know it is better when it is warm."

I stared at her with hatred, wishing innumerable evil upon her and bit down into the horrible filth she forced into my palette. Revulsion coursed through me and I shivered, goosebumps covering my entire body. My butthole puckered and fresh tears followed the salty paths to my chin. I could feel the juices sliding down my throat and the stringy meat coated my teeth. Two quick bites to mash it up as best as I could before tilting my head back and forcing it down. It spread its tendrils of pulp out as it slid down into my stomach. I highly doubted it would stay there long. Another piece made its way toward me on the fork and I let out a sob. 

"Please, I just can't. Don't make me do this. If you loved me-"

I was cut off when the fork jammed into my mouth and into my tongue. I pulled back instinctively from the pain and bit down accidently into the piece. The juices exploded in all directions and I choked once, twice, and the first piece came back up along with whatever she had drugged me with.

She tsked, cleaned it up, and pressed another piece toward me once more. 

I really fucking hate squash.

My eyes snapped open and my adrenaline immediately tripled. I fumbled with the sheets as I tried to untangle my sweaty legs from the cotton prison and bounded down the hallway to the security panel. I punched in the four digit code and a womans friendly voice greeted me several seconds later.

This is Watchful Skies operator 212, we received a motion detection alarm. Is everything okay in your home?

It was only a few steps from bedroom to hall but I was out of breath. I am not sure yet. Will you please stay on the line while I check the home?

Certainly sir.

Our home is on the smaller side but like all ranch-style homes it has a lot of windows. I reached for the bat I keep behind the closet door and slowly walked through each moon-lit room. I checked each window and door carefully for signs of forced exit or damage and each closet and hiding place. With each room my heart rate increased slightly, knowing that would be the room I found someone.

When I made a full circle of the home I let out a long breath and tried to regain my composure. I put the bat back in its place and informed the woman all was clear. She asked for the verbal clear code and I gave it to her and re-armed the system. I wiped the few beads of sweat off of my brow before heading into the bedroom.

My wife sat huddled in bed with eyes as big as Ive ever seen. Its okay, sweetheart. Just a false alarm. 

But, but why would it alarm at all? Are you sure you checked everywhere? Nothing is missing?

I crawled into bed and put my arms around her tightly and scratched her back. Yes everything is fine. Electronics are silly like that sometimes, you know? At least we know it works! I flashed my best grin and kept scratching until she drifted back into sleep.

-------------------

We both woke up a bit groggy from the midnight interruption but a large mug of coffee quickly remedied the slowness of step and glazed expressions. I tore the rubber band off of the paper and handed her all but the sports section. After a few poorly written stories about our awful teams and two pieces of peanut butter toast I got up and got ready for work.

Any news in the paper this morning, dear?

Nope, she replied with a grin.

See, nothing to be worried about. Lets get to work shall we?

I offered her my arm and walked down to the basement. We slipped on our lap coats and rubber galoshes and I keyed in the code. The large metal door swung in silently and I stepped through first. Just as I suspected one of our children had tried to escape again. I walked over to the cage our first born was in and inspected the damage. A few bent bars here and there but nothing I couldnt fix.

See? I asked my wife, I told you this was a good idea. *Why do we need to electrify the cages* you asked. *Why do we need a security system? What if they get suspicious?* She is a little hellion and needs to be taught a lesson. I directed my voice to our daughter and smacked her hard across the face. You try escaping again and a little zap will be the least of your worries.

<TEXT> 

I am writing this from my mother-in-laws house, trying to recall everything I can over the past few days. Fear doesnt know age.

-------------------

When you watch a scary movie you are jumpy, nervous, on the edge the entire time because *you know* something is going to happen. It wouldnt be a scary movie if nothing did after all. Once the movie is over you slowly come down from the edge but you are wary, apprehensive. Strange sounds set your heart into overdrive and your imagination goes wild. When a lightbulb fizzles out or a door closes by itself that fear flares back up for a moment. That is how my family and I felt for the first few days back in our home.

Lights were left on all night in the hallway and kitchen, the vent fan in the bathroom turned on to mask the sounds of the night, and the bed was pulled away from the walls. When nothing happened that first night a wave of reassurance washed over us and we began to behave more normally again. The house was filled with the soft, tinkling laughter of our daughter and her silly antics removed any lingering fear or worry. 

It was good to be home. It is so easy to take for granted the things you have until they are taken from you. I found myself working harder at my job, more productive, so that I could get home sooner and spend time with my wife and daughter. I am pretty sure she knows the sound of my car now because when I open up the front door she is already moving toward it with an expectant grin. Those bright, blue eyes filled with the innocence and joy of a child lumbering toward me with each disjointed step. 

Every day she seems to learn something new. Just last week she has said four new words, signed two more, and began walking. But my favorite of all is hide and seek. Babies love peek-a-boo which is just a stationary version of hide and seek so it makes sense that they love the mobile game as well. She will crawl around behind her toy house and peek her head through the windows until I catch her gaze, then duck down and giggle. 

My wife and I bought her a nylon tent with tunnels that connect to each side for her birthday and set it up in her nursery this week. She loves it! We bought a little campfire set with the logs and fire and smores and hotdogs to roast and a little lantern to hang at the top. This is her new favorite place to play hide and seek. So many places to hide and crawl around, her own little maze. 

Every evening when I get home my girls give me a big hug and kiss, my daughters little arms grip around my neck and she says dada nonstop for the next half hour. I set my things down and crawl around after her while she hides and giggles and screams in delight. Ill pop my head through a tunnel and reach my arms around the other side to tickle her chubby thighs. Suddenly I am on the other side reaching through the front flaps. Then my huge body worms down another tunnel and I take all of the space up inside of the tent while she escapes down another tunnel toward freedom. Round and round we go until I am tired and dinner is ready. 

You would think with all of this play time she would get worn down by the end of the day and zonk out on her mommies belly after a good nursing but she is a ball of boundless energy. What used to be quiet time for my wife and I has been pushed from 7:30 to 8:30 and now this week past 9:00 PM. We still turned out all of the lights at 8:00 except for the reading lamp and let the night lights illuminate the rest of the home.

After dinner I was down on the floor reading her favorite books to her while she went back and forth between building a tower out of blocks and knocking it down. I finished the fourth or fifth book and clapped my hands as is custom at the end of a kids book and she took off for the nursey. I sighed and looked at my wife with a smile as my little girl waddled off for me to follow. On all fours, I growled my big scary daddy growl and slinked along the floor.

I smell a little baby, yes. I moved forward slowly, sniffing around the corner and peeked my head into the dimly lit room.

She sat at the edge of the tent with one hand on the flap looking over her shoulder to make sure I was following. Her eyes lit up and she lunged forward into the tent, knees sliding noisily along the nylon fabric. I waited until she stopped moving before proceeding to the tunnel she occupied, pushing my hand down to poke her in back. I was rewarded with a little squeal and the swish swish swish of her chubby legs motoring forward to the center of the tent. I gave my best lion roar and pocked my head through the flaps. She jumped backward and tugged on my hair before moving to another exit. 

I circled, growling softly, pushing my hands in this spot and that spot to see if she would grab back like she sometimes does. Tiny little razor sharp teeth clamped down on my finger and I pulled back quickly. 

Dang it! No biting, sweetie. She has been teething non-stop for over a month and chews on everything. It is a work in progress. I poked my head into the tent to pull her out but was met with her little feet churning away quickly to the end of a tunnel.

I wanted to get a hold of her quickly before the biting left her young mind so I leapt over the tent and reached into the tunnel she was in. I gently grabbed hold of her shoulders and her teeth immediately sank into my thumb. Only this time she didnt let go. I pulled her out to give her bottom a pat but was greeted with a furious swipe across my face. Razor sharp nails dug deeply into my skin and drew blood and tears. My vision was blurred but I could make out *something* resembling my daughter. The eyes were dark, dim, deeply set in anger and hatred. It was her sweet little face cast over with a horrible evil sneer. I gasped and out of the corner of my eye could see my daughter worm her way out of another tunnel, looking up at me with wide eyes. 

I tried to blink away the blood and tears but whatever this thing was squirmed out of my grip and sank its horrible teeth into my calf. I could feel the muscle separating inch by inch. Howling in pain I swiped out for it only to retreat back into the tunnel. My wife came running in as I was scooping up my daughter and limping forward to the door. Her eyes took in the damage to my face, the confused fear coated our daughter, and realization set in. She took our daughter and ran to the car.

Closing the door on her heels I turned slowly just in time to see the thing spring forward, nails glinting in the dim glow of the night light. I barely had time to raise an arm up before it crashed into me with surprising force and I staggered down to one knee. My leg throbbed all the way up to my knee, hot searing cuts opened on my arm where I had taken its charge. Blood continued to trickle into my eyes blurring my vision and I flung my arm out in a wide arc to try and slam into my tormentor. 

I felt the back of my hand connect with its leg and saw it fling sideways off balance. I lunged forward and landed directly on top of it. Bones cracked and a high-pitched screech sent cracks across the mirror and windows. I clutched at my ears but gasped when a talon started to burrow into my chest. Reaching under me and rolling sideways I held it at arms length and battered it into the solid wood drawing table. Another series of cracks, probably ribs this time. Between rapid blinks I could see pure hatred mixed with pain in the mimics face. 

Adrenaline coursed through me and powered my arms into action. I bent and twisted and squeezed and tore at the horror in front of me. Blind rage overtook me. Invading my home, tormenting my family, scaring my child. My hands did not leave much left when I was done. With my one good eye I watched the life slip from the terrible thing and once it did I broke down. My body wracked with sobs and somewhere deep inside I knew I would never be the same.

Then a slow, maniacal chuckle echoed through the house.

Fears never go away, they just get suppressed. And they get stronger.

<TEXT> I used to have a habit of sleeping with an arm or a leg hanging off of the side of the bed. For whatever reason it was comfortable to me. Then I watched Childs Play. The little psycho doll hiding under beds and slashing peoples tendons. I was probably eight or nine when I first watched it and my habit came to an abrupt end.

For years I was fearful of something hiding under my bed poised to attack the moment I swung my legs over the edge or dangled a hand down. So I began jumping out of bed. I was not afraid to be in bed and go to sleep and I was not afraid to grab my toys out from under the bed or even play under the bed IF I was already on the floor. The unknown, the hidden, out of my sight lines - that is what scared me. 

As do most childhood fears like being afraid of the dark or the deep end of the pool I grew out of my need to jump off the bed and my habit of arm or leg dangling off the side of the bed slowly took hold once again. I dont know whether it is the fact that as we age we become more rational or become bigger and stronger and more capable. Every so often the movie would pop up on TV late at night, usually around October and November, and I think about my silly fear and chuckle. But without fail that very first morning I would hesitate slightly before getting out of bed. Just for a brief flicker that fear would rush to the front of my mind and I would need to push it back. 

The last time that happened was probably a decade and a half ago, maybe even longer, because I cant remember the last time I hesitated. Until this morning. 

I am 31 now, married and have a child of my own. I would like to say that I run my household but I dont. My little girl does. Every drawer has a special lock on it. Every corner has rubber coatings. Baby gates dominate the landscape. And my king sized bed lies unceremoniously on the floor. No box frame, no box springs, just a low profile mattress covered in pillows and sheets. Why, you might ask? So that our sweet little girl wont fall off. 

Now you may be asking yourself why any of this matters to the story at hand. Remember how as I child I would be afraid of things under my bed? This morning I awoke with a start. Heart racing, feet and palms sweating, and blood dripping from my outstretched arm. Thin, deep cuts ran the length of my forearm. The cuts began at the point where my arm extended off of the edge of the bed. 

It is hard to be afraid of something under your bed when it is lying flat on the floor with your body weight pressing it down but at that moment I was terrified. My eyes flicked around the dim room trying to see the culprit. When nothing jumped out at me as obvious and all hiding places appeared empty I slowly made my way out of bed, trying not to let any more of my blood further saturate the sheets and attended to my wounds in the bathroom.

After a lot of gauze and athletic tape my arm was bandaged up so I began searching around the house for anything out of place, missing, uncharacteristic. After finding nothing I tried to calm my nerves and settle down. I tried the logic approach - The alarm was still on, nothing set it off, what did this to my arm?

I went in to wake up my wife and explain to her what happened when I saw a glint of metal coming from the grate next to our bed. Sprinting the last few steps I pushed the bedside table out of the way and ripped the vent right off of the wall. A few drops of blood on the back of the vent cover were all I could find but I swear I saw something inside of there! 

My wife woke up startled from all of the noise and saw my bandaged arm and torn up wall. Her first words were along the lines of what the hell are you doing? but she was cut off when a low, soft chuckle made its way out of the vent and into our ears.

---------------

UPDATE:

First I want to thank you all for the amazing suggestions given in the comments. I never would have thought of most of them to try. Honestly I was too afraid to do much thinking at all other than to get out. 

I wasnt able to get any chlorine gas but I did hook up my car via a very long hose. I went through the house and closed every vent except for one and dropped the hose down into it. Once the car was running I ran around the house pouring salt around each vent to try to further force whatever this thing is to stay inside and suffer the fumes. 

Once that was done I set our motion sensors on the highest setting and armed the house. They should pick up any movement the size of a bunny or larger. I opened up the app to my security system and watched for any motion notifications while I circled the house, making sure nothing escaped from a vent or window or hole in the ground. Who knows, right? 

I ran my car for a full gas tank worth just to be sure and then let the house air out while I walked to the closest gas station with my spare tank. I watched my security notifications all day, all night, and all through the next day as well without a single alarm. I figured the house was probably cleared out by then and safe for me to walk around in. There was still a funny smell in the air but I opened up all of the vents and turned the attic fan on and opened up all of the windows. None of the salt was disturbed so I know it didnt make it out of a vent. 

Thank you so much for the great ideas, guys! We are going to wait one more day to really clear out the air and then move back in. My wife is looking forward to sleeping in our bed once again and so am I.

<TEXT> He was not a good person. Not a good husband or father, not a good neighbor or teacher. English class, I believe.

He was, however, an excellent task master. What good are children if not for labor? He had many.

His house was sparkling and spotless. Martha Stewart would be proud. The lawn immaculate, rivaling the cities botanical gardens. Had you been unfortunate enough to be his neighbor you would see his children work their fingers to the bone day in and day out. 
They could not play. They could not frolic. They could not eat until the chores were done. 

I never heard them talk, let alone laugh. But I heard him.

Bite the bullet, girl. You dilly dally now youll miss supper.

Dont you dare cut corners, boy. A man is only as good as the job he does.

Looks like you finished by the skin of your teeth today!

What are you waiting for? The early bird gets the worm!

My wife told me not to interfere. She told me to let the police handle things. I couldnt do that.

------------

I strapped him tightly to a sturdy chair in my basement and slapped his face to wake him up. I forced the mouth widener into his thin-lipped maw. No pain, no gain. My eyes must have twinkled when I uttered those four words because fear dripped out of his in the form of tears. 

Using a scalpel I slowly peeled the gums away from his teeth one by one. 

I am not sure what exactly constitutes a corner on a human being so I did my best. His shoulders gushed from the deep gashes and his feet pumped blood out of the stumps where toes used to be. 

As the color in his skin slowly faded I placed a bullet in between his red teeth. Time to call it a day, neighbor. I placed a punch on the back of the bullet casing and mashed into it with a hammer. 

I hated English.

<TEXT> Time is a powerful thing. It dictates how we value activities and what we warrant good enough. You can waste time or be efficient with your time however you can never get time back. It is ever-flowing and only on one direction.


The pleasantly voiced woman turns her body forty five degrees and gestures with her outstretched arm to the gentleman behind her. 


With that being said what would you do if you had no perception of time? Would you live your life any differently? Would you waste time on video games or books or social media? Would you focus on one hobby and perfect it? Would you simply go crazy?


She cocks her head slightly and smiles to the group.


That is what we aim to find out. So far Ian has been living within this confined apartment-style cell for twelve years and four months. We supply everything he needs and asks for barring items such as a clock or calendar. Some of you might have noticed the clock hanging on the wall. Does it look somewhat strange to you?


A hand goes up slowly, nervously.


Yes, what do you notice about the clock?


The young boy timidly responds. It only has a second hand.


Correct! Ian is not the first volunteer for this project. Steve did not last very long, unfortunately. Six weeks if I remember correctly. He made an innumerable amount of comments during his time in the cell about needing to know. Before we placed Ian into his new home we installed a clock with only the second hand in an attempt to understand just how much information we need about time in order to function. Does anyone else notice something different about the clock?


Its too fast, blurted out another child. 


Well done! Yes, we have sped up the second-hand twice now, each an increment of one eighth of a second. It was believed that if done in small enough increments that Ian would not notice and therefore use his time that much more effectively. So far the hypothesis has been correct.

A brief pause, then, Any questions?

<TEXT> On your left you will see ten complete strangers living in a room. They will remain together in the room for one week or until only one person is left. Inside of the room is one chair, one bed, and one book. Typically there will be one homosexual, one criminal, one hippie, and one corporate executive among the ten people. Of course we have done studies were each individual was of the same job type, sexual preference, religion, and so on, however the results seldom vary. On average a group lasts thirty one hours. Interesting side note  when we put ten cult leaders together in the room they lasted longer than any other group at eighty seven hours.

As you can see this particular group is entering the eleventh hour and already groups have formed. Ah, subject 10 has begun fighting with subject 8 over the book. Lets see what happens, shall we? This is the third fight over the book already between these two. It could get ugly this time. Oh my, subject 10 broke a leg off of the chair and is waving it at subject 8. You may want to look away, the rage in her eyes is  ok yes she drove the chair leg into his neck. 

You would think that knowing they were being watched would change their behavior but it doesnt. We just hate each other so much, dont we? Now if youll step this way and look to your right

<TEXT> My name is Aaron and I work for a call center. It is a ridiculously boring job but it pays the bills and I know what I am getting into each day, you know? Very scheduled, very compartmental, very accommodating of my OCD tendencies. The company that I take calls for is pretty famous for their bad infomercials and sketchy product but yet we get hundreds of calls a day wanting to schedule a free consultation. 

Those are the calls I usually get. Take their information, fill a spot on the calendar, next call. The reason I am posting here today is because a few nights ago I received a call Id never taken before and pray I never take again. At first I thought maybe it was a prank (we get those a lot, too) but pretty soon I realized this man was serious and I freaked out. Below is the transcription of that call.

03/02/2017 - 7:14PM

*Operator* - Good evening, thank you for choosing [REMOVED]. You are speaking with Aaron, are you ready to change your life?

*Caller* - Please help me!

*Operator* - I like your enthusiasm, sir. May I have your first and last name, please?

*Caller* - [REMOVED]

*Operator* - Great, thank you so much for calling us [REMOVED]. I have a few simple questions I must ask in order to speed up the consultation process. The entire process will only take a few moments. Would that be ok?

*Caller* - You dont understand, I already have your product. I need HELP! 

*Operator* - I am afraid I dont understand [REMOVED], why are you calling the consultation line if you already have our product?

*Caller* - This was the only number I could find. Look, I really need help. I doubted you, the product, whatever. I cant get it to stop!

*Operator* - Sir, get what to stop?

*Caller* - My hair! It keeps growing! 

*Operator* - I am sorry [REMOVED] but isnt that what our product is designed for? I am failing to see the issue. Are you afraid to get it cut at a barber shop? I can assure you, sir, that no one will know you used our product.

*Caller* - LOOK! IT IS GROWING SO FAST I CAN LITERALLY WATCH IT GROW! I NEED HELP! WHAT THE HELL DO I DO?

*Operator* - Sir, please try to remain calm. I am going to put you on a brief hold while I contact my manager.

-Hold music-

[I called my manager over and explained the call, telling her that I thought it was a prank call at first but the terror in the guys voice sounded so real. She patched into the call and took over. I just sat there in stunned silence while I listened to the exchange.]

*Operator* - Good evening, this is Julia, the telecomm manager. Would you please explain the situation very calmly, sir?

*Caller* - OH MY GOD.. OK ok ok umm. So a few weeks ago I called and had a consultation. The product came and I was excited to try it out because I had a blind date in a few days. I admit I had my hesitations about the legitimacy of your claim so I applied a little more product than the directions stated and no..

*Operator* - I am sorry to cut you off sir but did you say that you did not follow the instructions in the packaging?

*Caller* - Oh God is it going to stop? Uh, yea that I didnt really read them carefully. Shit. loud buzzing- I just scooped out a bunch and rubbed it in and took a few vitamins.

*Operator* - Sir, put the clippers down and listen to me carefully. Think hard now. How much of the product did you apply to your scalp? How much of the jar is left?

*Caller* - There is none left. I used about half last night and the rest of it this morning. grunts and the sounds of a struggle come across the line-

*Operator* - I have one last question. Did you use any of the specially formulated shampoo and conditioner?

*Caller* - Uh yea I did this morning when I took a shower.

*Operator* - Ok I need you to listen closely. DO NOT use any more product. Pills, shampoo, condition, nothing. Understand me?

*Caller* - Yea ok.

*Operator* - Good. DO NOT under any circumstances cut your hair, trim your hair, run a comb or brush through your hair. Not even your fingers. All of these activities promote hair growth and that is the last thing we want right now. Am I making myself clear?

*Caller* - Yes but you are really scaring me. What is going on? 

*Operator* - One last thing, sir. DO NOT fall asleep. Once your hair stops growing you will need to wait two full days and then you will be able to cut it like normal. We will check on your in the morning for the next three days for updates.

*Caller* - Uh yea ok, uh bye.

---------------------------

Because I was the one to take the call I had to check up on him each morning. The first morning he answered and thanked me for checking in. He sounded incredibly tired and scared. So far it hadnt stopped growing. The next morning he didnt answer so I tried back two more times, at thirty minute intervals. 

After the third call going to voicemail I called the police to head over and check on him. They found him on his sofa where he had fallen asleep. His hair had grown so long and thick that it had suffocated him. They found over ten feet of hair in his airways. 

Because of this incident we now sell our product in daily capsules and have warning labels on every part of our packaging. We also have a special protocol designed for calls such as these. I beg you, regardless of the product, no matter how harmless or innocuous it may seem, always follow directions.

<TITLE> Never buy a mattress off of Craigslist - 3 </TITLE>

<TEXT> 

My wife went from chains to cuffs within minutes. We were stuffed into the back of a squad car and the sirens started up. Twenty minutes later we were on the outskirts of town at a park on the river that no one ever goes to due to the smell. The office opened the door and let us out. He led us about a hundred yards away from the car and told us to face the river on our knees. My wife was balling her eyes out, pleading for our lives. 

*I aint gonna kill ya, just need to look like it, alright? Now shut up and listen.*

So we did. Turns out this cop was new to the area, two weeks to be exact, and noticed a lot of weird, off-the-record stuff going on. When he was transferred he was told to take some drug that is exploding out on the streets so he faked it. He didnt know what it was but he figured it was some kind of weird mind crap because the Chief would give people orders no one should ever accept but no one asked any questions. They just did whatever he said. Anyway the police have been keeping this human trafficking stuff hush-hush because it is how they are testing the drug or getting it out on the streets or something. The cop was told to take us out here and pop us since I was causing all this trouble talking about kidnapping and stuff online, bringing unnecessary attention to Downtown. The last thing he tells us is that this will hurt our ears and to fall down and never come back to the city.

**BANG BANG BANG BANG**

I flopped forward like a dying fish and laid face-down on loose gravel and mud. I heard a thud and hoped my wife had done the same. I whispered softly to lie still until we could no longer hear the car. A few minutes passed before I ventured to flip over and found a small key nearby. The key unlocked the cuffs holding my wrists together and I leaned over to undo my wifes. She was trembling on the cold ground and I pulled her into my arms. 

*Its going to be OK, now. Youre safe with me now, babe.*

She stared back at me with eyes that had seen far too much. I am not sure how long we sat there staring or how long we cried, but eventually she broke the silence.

*They took her. Our baby. They took her.*

*Who? Where did they take her, hunnie?*

She started to cry again but it didnt last long. She was spent. It would be the last time we cried until this whole thing was over. She explained what had happened and how Brian and the receptionist used the storage facility to move people and drugs. They lured people up there with all kinds of Craigslist ads, sometimes to steal the person, sometimes to spread the drug. She said the mattresses would be filled with the vials and sent out all over the city. Some of the people they stole were given the drug, some were sold off and some were used as slave labor. She wasnt harmed or abused in any way, just treated harshly but she didnt know what happened to our little girl. I promised her Id find our daughter and bring her back and we would get out of this forsaken city.

It isnt easy leaving Downtown if you are in a position like us  no money, nowhere to go. But I knew our lives depended on it. 

---------------------

I still had all of my gear in the car and since I had parked it off the beaten path I hoped it was still there. Obviously I couldnt contact the police for help and I didnt have many friends to begin with, let alone trust now that all of this had happened, so I was on my own. I told my wife Id be back as soon as I could with the car and Id take her to the next city over and get her into a motel while I figured things out. 

It took me a few hours to make it back to my car but I was in luck because not only was my car still there but it hadnt been broken into yet or thrown up on blocks to steal the tires and rims so all my gear was still in it and it ran. My wife was sitting in the same place I left her, throwing rocks into the slow-moving river. I went as far as I could go before filling up the gas tank. While I was there I pulled out the limit for cash on the card and gave it to my wife for food and clothes and then drove another half a tank of gas away before pulling into a pretty nice looking motel. It was one of those extended-stay places with a little kitchen and living room and a nice hot breakfast each morning. The nice thing about being dead is that no one can come after you when you dont pay your credit card bill. 

We made love that night like it was our honeymoon, or like it was the last time wed ever see each other. I am not sure if there is a difference, honestly. That morning, full from a nice breakfast, I went to a pawn shop and picked up a heavy-duty Taser and a decent rifle. It wasnt as nice as the one that was taken from me at the factory but it would do. I made my way back to the hotel, pulled out whatever money I could from the ATM and then we headed the opposite direction. I didnt know for sure but in case we were followed or my credit cards were tracked I didnt want to take any chances. I only used cash from that point on and went about four hours in the other direction to a different extended stay motel. This one was just as clean as the last and I thought it would make due until I could find our daughter. My wife promised she would stay indoors as much as possible and only use cash when she needed food. We tested out the bed before I left. 

I made a new e-mail and kept checking Craigslist all day to see if I could find any ads like the ones they used so I can try and meet up with someone for information. I responded to a few but so far nothing back from them. I waited until late into the night before putting a few more cameras around the storage facility. Since the cops were a part of this whole thing I figured they wouldnt shut down operations. Once everything was set up I retired to my car to watch footage and browse the Deep Web for anything about infants. I couldnt imagine what they would want a child for and I was somewhat thankful for that. Trying to imagine all the things that could be happening would bring any father to his knees. 

----------------------

I must have passed out because I woke up to warm sunlight on my face and my laptop and phone clutched tightly in my hands. Both were dead. Fortunately I had a car charger for my phone so I was able to get that going again but I didnt have anything for the laptop. I must have left it at the house. Without the footage I could only hope to get lucky with a hit on some of those ads. 

Not too far from where I was parked was an amazing smelling food truck so I went over and grabbed something to eat  breakfast burritos with homemade salsa. So good. Halfway through the bulging tortilla I got a buzz  someone responded to my ad inquiry. This one was for a single-sized mattress. I was guessing that maybe the size of the mattress was code for something, maybe age. After several more e-mails and much convincing I was able to get the meeting place to a local Wal-Mart parking lot. With the Taser in my pocket I waited for the van to pull up.

Have you ever used a Taser before? It is so satisfying. When the gentleman was showing me the mattress I jabbed the Taser right into his crotch and let it rip. The look on his face was priceless. After a bit of interrogation in the spacious cargo area of the van he gave me enough information to believe my little girl was alive and unharmed. My main concerns was whether or not she was given the drug or if she would have eaten at all during our time apart. She is a pretty sensitive girl and a picky eater. Apparently they dont usually take kids but if they do they raise them and sell them as child brides at an early age.

*You are going to go to wherever my daughter is and you are going to bring her back to me. If you dont Ill find you, your family, everyone you ever cared about, understand?*

I took my new friends wallet as insurance. At least I would have his address if anything went south. I could have guessed where we were going. After a few minutes he parked the van up front at the receptionist office and went into a side door. Peeking through the windshield from the back of the van I could make out a few kids faces and hear shrill cries for mommy. My gut was wrenching around  I couldnt leave them. 

As promised my daughter came out in this bastards arms and he opened up the back of the van. The look on her face when she saw me was magical. She squirmed and leapt out of his arms and crawled over to me faster than Id ever seen. 

*How many kids are in there?*

*Um, like five, man I dont know. Please, I got your daughter.*

*Who is here right now? Who is watching them kids?*

*Just the new receptionist, man. Come on, man, I did what you asked.*

*Bring them all out.* I finished my finish with a crackle of the Taser. *Bring them out and then we are done, ok?*

He did as I asked, although it took an agonizingly long time. At first I thought he screwed me and was about to hop out of the van when the door opened and a range of kids came out, all old enough to walk. The new receptionist was yelling at the guy but he just slammed the door on her and opened up the van. The kids piled in with me and my daughter and we were off. About three blocks down I told the guy to get out.

I drove off into the heart of Downtown to the news station headquarters. I knew the police wouldnt help me but maybe if I dropped a bunch of grimy, starved kids at a news desk claiming they were kidnapped Id get a little attention. Of course they thought I was crazy but the state of the kids gave them enough pause to look into some things. I didnt wait around, but I felt like I at least gave the kids some chance, some hope. I trashed the van (they did horrible things with it!) and buckled my little girl into her car seat. 

----------------------

I am posting this from a Starbucks in a hopefully far-enough-away location to never be bothered again. I watch the news to see if anything came of those kids but nothing, yet. Ive tried contacting other agencies to look into the police there but maybe this is the best way, posting here. Maybe with enough attention it can create some change.

My daughter has gained back most of the weight she lost and doesnt seem to be affected at all by the ordeal. Only time will tell. Jobs are hard to come by but we are making ends meet. All we wanted was a nice mattress but my family is safe, that is all that really matters. Sometimes you just have to be happy with what you have.

<TEXT> 

So like I said in my first post I unblocked Brians number and tried to get in touch with him again but it said it was disconnected. Of course I gave the number to the police to try and track but I have yet to hear any news from them, which is incredibly discouraging. They say you only have 48 hours to find a missing person and I am approaching that number very quickly. I cant I just cant lose my family. My wife is the sweetest, most loving and wonderful mother to our beautiful, vibrant daughter. I remember when she was born and  sorry. I have been thinking a lot about that night. I guess it is the only thing pushing me on. *I have to find my family!*

One of the comments mentioned checking my car for a tracking device. Dont know why I didnt think of it before so I went out last night before I went to work and after a few minutes of checking I did find something under the rear bumper, on my exhaust pipe. I dont know if it is a tracking device or what but I turned it in to the police on my way to work. Why didnt they think to check my car? Anyway I didnt really feel like working much. I was distracted and exhausted. My boss told me to take a few nights off, paid, to clear my head. I couldnt believe it, not because it is out of the ordinary but he is just a hardass most of the time I didnt think he had a soft spot on him. I took full advantage of it by heading back up to the storage site to see if I could find anything. 

Like I mentioned in my first post I work two jobs, one being warehouse stocking overnight and during the day I work for a home security company called Vivint installing and servicing home systems. One of the neat things we offer is a camera that you can access from anywhere in the world and watch a live stream. Most people use it as a nanny cam or to see what their pets do while they are gone but I had a great idea. Id set one up on the roof and then I could watch it from my work laptop to see if anyone is moving mattresses around. If I could get a visual on the guy we could catch him! So I headed up to the site and climbed up the backside of one of the buildings that had the humidity controlled units.

According to the receptionist they only have 24 of these units and since they are selling a ton of mattresses I figured that is a unit they would need to have. There were cameras all over the place so I couldnt get a perfect angle or see the whole row of units but I was able to place it in such a way that I could see about two thirds of them. Not ideal but better than nothing. The camera is tiny so I wasnt worried about anyone finding it and I know it can run for over 6 months on a fresh battery. 

Since I dont have anywhere to sleep at home I decided Id just recline the seat in my car and try to snooze a little while keeping an eye on the footage. Now I know a lot of you are probably thinking There is no way Brian is ever coming back to that place. And while I agree with you, what else can I do? I have to have hope, to believe they are still alive and unhurt. It is the only thing keeping me going. I am sure you can understand that. 

I must have actually fallen asleep because a train horn startled me and I jerked up, knocking the laptop off of my lap. The train was moving pretty slowly, even slower than most around here and there was a van and a few cars waiting at the crossing. It took a moment to remember where I was and rub the sleep out of my eyes. It was 3AM. I rewound the footage in triple speed to see if anyone had shown up during the hour and a half that I was laying there and only twenty minutes before a 15-passenger van showed up just inside the frame of the camera. It was hard to tell but I am pretty sure it was the receptionist that was there the day we came to buy the mattress. Two guys were hauling mattresses out of the back of the van and into one of the units. I started to get excited. I had him. I found him! Then I got sick to my stomach. From inside of the unit came five women, most of them older but one was pretty young. I couldnt see their faces because of the distance from the camera but I could see that they were chained together and gagged with something. One of the guys gave something to the receptionist lady, most likely money, and they piled into the van and drove off. 

Wait, I thought, didnt I just see a van? I looked up and the train was gone, the cars that were waiting now far off in the distance. I turned on my car and took off after the fading tail-lights, praying Id be able to catch up and hope they hadnt already turned off somewhere. I grabbed my phone and called the police, telling them everything that transpired and where I was/direction I was heading. They told me to pull over and to stop following but screw that - I floored it even more and tried to close the distance. 

Pretty soon I heard sirens from several different directions but I had lost sight of the van, or maybe never had sight of it. When I finally caught up to the taillights I was chasing they belonged to a Corolla or something. About that time my phone went off. It was the police, they had found the van! I drove my way over, only a few blocks east of where I was, hoping for good news. 

When I got there they had two men in cuffs in the back of a squad car which left soon after. Five women were laying on gurneys being tended to by medical staff, but none were my wife or daughter. I was relieved, happy, thankful that they were safe, but also devastated. Where was my family? After interrogation or whatever of the men and the women that were saved it was determined that they would have been sold as slaves  human trafficking. The police are still looking for my family, of course, but they arent acting very positive about the whole thing. 

I just left my day job because my boss caught me still watching footage of the unit and told me to just go home. I know it sounds stupid but what else can I do? I cant eat or sleep or even think without feeling the need to vomit. My family, slaves. Sold to some freak that will do God knows what to them? My eleven month old daughter. So beautiful, so innocent. Daddy is going to find you!

----------------

**UPDATE**

So far no one has come back to that unit other than police. I watched them drag everything out, sick to my stomach. I watched their cars drive off full of evidence. Everyone seems to have vanished that was connected to this aside from the two guys that were arrested. They havent given up any information from what the station is telling me. I dont know why but I started to browse Craigslist again to see if any new ads were put up similar to the one I had responded to. I didnt find anything but I did remember a few stories Id heard about the Deep Web/Dark Web and how human trafficking goes down on those sites. 

I dove head first into that awful area of cyberspace trying to find anything that could help me find my family. The things I found only made me that much sicker and more worried about my family. Who could do such things to fellow human beings? I know we are in a sick, confused world but oh  I will just stop there. I dont want to upset anyone by the things I saw. After an hour of searching I was about to give up when I found something hosted by BMK. I had seen it before and passed it by but looking at it again jogged my memory. The only reason it stood out to me at all is because of the CL ad. Brian had called himself the Mattress King. It is a pretty standard claim, to be fair, but I didnt think I could pass up an opportunity even if it wasnt him. 

I responded to it with an old e-mail I hadnt used since probably high school and got a response almost immediately. $5000 cash for a female. $4000 for a male. Discounts for age. An address to meet at and a time.

When I plugged the address in I was surprised to see how close it was to the storage facility. One of your comments was right, they kept operations close. Obviously I dont have the cash but I have a gun. What mid-westerner doesnt? I am on my way right now. I dont want to be late.

----------

**FINAL UPDATE**

So as I said I like being early and I figured my old pal Brian would be late to this arrangement. I got there an hour ahead of time to scope out the place and find a good spot to take him out. 

I found a nice loft where I could overlook the big, open factory floor. I parked my car a ways away at a thrift store parking lot and walked to it with a guitar case - hiding my .22. I guessed they would probably have a few people out front waiting for me to come in and Brian inside with the lineup of women. Fortunately I guessed correctly. 

A total of six armed people showed up, four taking position somewhere outside. Brian and the receptionist stood inside with twenty women. My heart skipped a beat when I saw my wife among them. I almost cried out right then and there but I stifled it in time. 

I took careful aim and busted Brian's knee with the first shot. I'm assuming he went into shock because he dropped and laid there moaning for the entirety of my visit. My next shot took out the receptionist as she ran. 

The girls started screaming right away, obviously not knowing what was going on. A guy from outside came in but I was already back outside on my way down. I have never been happier than right then about my grandad forcing me to go hunting every year and "earn my dinner". It was paying off! It was then that I called the police. 

I waited until sirens were nearing before I shot the next two guards in the leg. Suffer for your sins. I made my way inside and used one of the guards handguns to finish Brian and the other guy with him after I let him see my face. I don't think my wife even noticed me until I put my hand on her face. 

I'm not sure where the last one ran off to but he didn't bother us as I unlocked the women and hugged my wife. *Where's my baby? Is she ok?*

She just shook her head. We cried, oblivious to the police filtering in.

<TITLE> Never buy a mattress from Craigslist - 1 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-21 15:16:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My wife and I have had the same mattress since we have been married. It is lumpy, dips horribly in the middle, and isnt large enough now that our daughter sleeps on it with us. I know, thats dangerous and not recommended at all. But when you go six straight months without more than an hour of sleep at a time you eventually cave in. With that being said I am always on the look-out for a good deal on a king size mattress and yesterday I found one. $125 for a *new set*, and not a cheap one either. Incredible, right? I thought so too so I called the guy up and asked if it was still available (you know how sometimes they advertise something really cheap because it doesnt exist). To my surprise it was so I set up for my wife and daughter to go out and take a look at 5PM. I would have rather just gone myself instead of dragging my cranky daughter all the way into Downtown but my wife is pretty particular about the firmness of the mattress so I had to make sure it was comfortable for her. 

Brian, the guy selling the mattress, said to call when we were on our way so he would know when to meet us at the storage site. I called but it went to voicemail so I left one and also texted him to let him know we are on our way. The whole drive there my wife and I are chatting happily about how great it will be to finally have a new mattress and have our own space in the bed once again. My daughter likes to sleep at a bit of a diagonal so that her hands are touching mommies shoulder and her feet are touching my leg. It is very sweet and cute but also incredibly uncomfortable because I have to sleep on the knifes edge of the bed in order to not crush anyone (dads out there I am sure you can relate). Fortunately the traffic isnt too bad yet so we make it right on time. I HATE being late to appointments. It is just so unprofessional and inconsiderate, you know?

I get out of the car and unstrap my daughter so that she can enjoy the cool breeze and point to all the new things she sees while we wait for Brian to arrive. After about fifteen minutes I walk into the office of the storage facility and ask to see if Brian maybe works there or if the receptionist knows anything about him. She told me that he works for a home staging company for when people try to sell their homes. That is why we can buy the mattress so cheap! It is unpackaged and set up so they cant resell it in a store. She assured me he was a great guy and was probably just running late due to traffic. I was glad I talked to her because I was still having a few doubts about why the mattress was such a good deal but his line of work made a lot of sense. My daughter and I walked around some more, singing songs and feeling the brick wall of the building and the nylon threads of the American flag swaying in the breeze. She is a very happy, sweet girl and loves to feel new things so I didnt notice how much time had passed until my wife popped out of the car and asked what was going on. Forty minutes had passed! This guy was ridiculously late. I handed off my daughter so that I could call him up and see what the deal was. 

*This is Brian.*

*Yea, hi, this is Steven. We had a 5PM meeting to look at a mattress. Where are you at, bud?*

*Oh yea ok I am thirty minutes away, Ill be there soon.*

Now as you know I hate being late. I also hate when others are late. *Seriously? It is 5:35PM and we agreed to 5PM, Brian. Dont bother, we are leaving.*

*I told you to call me when you were leaving so that I knew you were coming, this is the first time you are calling me so now I am coming.*

WHAT?!

*Look, Brian. I called you when we left our house and I left you a voicemail. I texted you to let you know we were on the highway. We agreed to 5PM and you stood us up. I dragged my daughter and wife out here for no reason and now we have to fight traffic to get back home. Thank you for wasting our time.*

I hung up before he could get another word in. I was furious. Who sets a time to meet but then doesnt show up until the person calls? Clearly this guy wasnt a real businessman. He called me right back but I ignored it. We needed dinner and showers, we had routines to follow or this baby was going to be up all night. He texted me right after trying to justify his reasoning, telling me I was foolish for not wanting to wait around to save so much money on a $1000 mattress. Obviously this guy didnt have kids. I added his number to my spam list so that I wouldnt get any more calls or texts from him and apologized to my wife for wasting our evening. I work two jobs to make enough for the bills and we dont have much time together as a family. I feel like a bit of a failure but my wife always reassures me, thanking me for working so hard. Still, I cant shake the sadness I feel when I come home late and barely get to spend any time with them so I was extra frustrated with Brian for wasting one of my only free evenings.

Of course traffic was awful heading back out of downtown and there were two car accidents because why not add insult to injury? My daughter was starting to get fussy so I was singing all her favorite songs and making silly faces to keep her occupied. It took over an hour to get home but once we hit the driveway everything was forgotten and we all smiled. Home at last! We went through our normal routine of dinner and bath time and instead of turning on the television I just played with my daughter until she was ready for bed. It was a nice change of pace. I cant believe how big she is getting! 

------------------------

The alarm went off far too early for my liking but I got up and did my best to crawl out of the dip in the bed without arousing anyone else. Got dressed, packed a lunch, ate a quick breakfast and I was off to work. The day was pretty uneventful which was nice because I couldnt keep my eyes open easily. Normally I get a few calls from my wife during the day and at least one picture showing our daughter doing something silly or new but I didnt get any of that today. I knew they had a few plans to go to the petting zoo and story time at the library so I didnt think much of it although I did miss my daily picture. Wednesday is always a special day because it food pantry day (at first we were just embarrassed but we try to make the best of it by guessing what dessert they will give us)! The generosity of people in our area is so amazing. They donate all organic foods, even organic meat. I usually make it home before my wife is done at the pantry so I tidy up the house and get ready to go out and grab all of the bags full of food. 

I kicked off my work boots and put my lunch bag away, cleaning up a few dishes in the sink and washing down my daughters high-chair tray. As I headed into the bedroom to change into more comfortable clothes I stopped dead in my tracks. There, in place of our small, lumpy bed was the king sized mattress on a simple bedframe. It even had sheets on it, nice ones. A few tears gathered at eat eye because I realized why my wife never called me today. She was busy surprising me with a new bed! She must have found Brians ad on Craigslist and went up to meet him on her own while I was at work. What a wonderful woman she is! On the bed was a small, white card. I rushed over to it, flopping onto the bed and taking the card in my hand to read.

Dear Steven,

I hope you like the mattress. Dont worry about payment, I already took what I needed.


-Brian

What the hell?! I sprang up off of the bed and went to my phone, calling my wife. No answer. No problem, she is probably wrapping up at the food pantry or driving home. She never answers when she is driving. 

I waited fifteen more minutes before calling again. She is never this late from coming home. 4:15 at the latest and it was already 4:30. I called again, straight to voicemail. I tried not to panic, tried to let my imagination run wild but I couldnt help it. Was she in an accident? Is she stuck in traffic? Please answer! After another twenty minutes and no response from her I drove over to the food pantry and found the managing volunteer just before they closed up for the night. 

*Hey Terry, was my wife here today?*

*Oh, hi Steven, no she never came today. I was a bit surprised myself but I thought maybe you finally found a better job and didnt need to come anymore.*

I drove home much faster than the law or safety would dictate praying that her car would be in the driveway, but it wasn't. I tried calling one more time with no luck. Sprinting around the house I searched for anything strange or missing. That is when I noticed the picture frame on our nightstand. The picture was torn down one side, leaving just me.

Tears started flowing down my face, coating my phone as I dialed 911.

We ran. We stumbled. We ran some more. Blindly, without regard for direction or purpose. My lungs burned, my legs wobbly, and my face covered with sweat from sprinting up several flights of steps and across many yards of empty hallways. That was when I realized I never once heard someone chasing. I reached a hand out to Lauren to steady her and after a second to catch our breath I led her to my most secret hiding place. It was an unmarked room that only three people could open. We hunkered down and regained our composures and our breath. I hadn't run like that since high school! 

Fortunately I keep snacks in my hiding places so that I don't need to bring them around. Much less suspicious that way, you see. Anyway, I reached up to the back of the top shelf and brought down a box of frosted mini wheat and a box of Ritz Bitz crackers. We ate as silently as we could, to nervous to enjoy the sustenance. 

After a while we chanced a few whispers:

*What do we do?*

*Gotta wait. Listen for any pursuit or search party*

*Maybe security will think it was just a vandal. Maybe no one saw our faces*

*Do you know who even called out back there? I didn't recognize the voice*

*No I haven't even worked here a week yet..*

*What was that? Shhhhh*

--------

We practically broke our necks craning our ears toward the door in hopes of knowing what might be just outside. No other sounds were heard. Hours passed by but nothing seemed to be happening out side of our hiding spot. Lauren needed to pee and the bathroom was literally across the hall. She cracked the door, waited. Cracked a little more, waited. All clear. She darted across into the bathroom to relieve the building pressure in her bladder, a pressure I was starting to feel as well. 

My head snapped up and dizziness overtook me for a moment. Shit, did I fall asleep? How long? SHIT, WHERE IS LAUREN? Maybe I just dozed for a moment and she will be coming right back. I waited, counting seconds in my head. Five minutes passed. Ten.

The door screams as I open it. God, you are a loud bastard! I peek my head out and look both ways like a little kid crossing the street. I step out. Cross the hall to the bathroom door. Crack it open. *Lauren?* No answer. I step in and check all the stalls. It's empty. They got her. At this point I just stopped caring and ran out and down the hall toward the basement. If she was alive she'd be there. Maybe I still had time. 

Rounding the last corner of another completely empty hall I skidded to a halt. Hundreds of employees gathered in a circle, filing the entire warehouse and spilling out of the entrance and into the hallway. No one turned around and I stepped back behind the corner. There was a fire escape of the far side of the warehouse I could get to from outside and maybe see what was going on invisibly. Making my way out into the cold and around the hospital made me realize just how exhausted I was. It had been over a day since I had slept. Finally I got to the door and badged it open, pulling it open just enough to get my lean frame in. For once I was thankful for the fire code of two separate doors. The inner door had a window so I could see in without needing to open it. 

They had her. Standing on the door, hands chained together in front of her. I couldn't hear what they were saying but the president took a key out that matched a key being held by the HR director. The keys were attached to a chain hanging down almost to the ground from her hands and pressed into the holes in the door. A pale light emitted from the crease around the door as it slowly dropped down into the floor with Lauren chained to it. I could see her mouth split as wide as it could go and her entire body straining against the chains as she screamed. Still, she descended. The pale light moved and sloshed like water in a jacuzzi. Oh God they are going to drown her!

I watched in horror as her eyes slid past the edge of the floor. Then the top of her head. The light showed water just below her head. Then two facilties workers brought a metal cover over and set it onto the hole in the floor, sealing off the light. 

My mind raced but in all the wrong directions. What could I do. There were police in there. I couldn't call 911. I had to get her out and fast. Making my way back to my hideout, I sat and sobbed. It all flooded out. I couldn't help it. My body heaved and shuddered. Again, I fell asleep. 

When I awoke Lauren was staring down at me, a smile on her beautiful face. *Hi Shane*

-CRACK-

She must have hit me hard because when my mind regained it's abilities I was chained and surrounded by my coworkers. She called me Shane. I'm not Shane! The keys went in. I slowly descended into a frigid liquid. She knew my real name. Why? Why?! The lid was placed over my head. All light was sealed off. 

I'm not sure how long I was in there. And I'm not sure what I was babbling about this whole time to you all about. 

My name ***IS*** Shane.

<TEXT> 
Today something new happened, something I only now realize I've seen just once before. A body was carted, covered and zipped up in a silver bag, down the basement hallway past my workshop and into the morgue. I say it was new because up until right now as I type this out I  thought it was. But I'll get back to that. 

Moments after the faceless body bag was pushed slowly into a huge steel room I've never been in and hope to never be in I saw my first new face since working here. She was stunning, breathtaking even. I fulfilled every clich in that moment. My heart raced, my mouth hung open, and I'm pretty sure I had a semi. Her eyes mirrored every color that she passed. Her posture perfect yet not aggressive. Petite. And lips like Angelina Jolie. Describing her fills me with shame knowing I paid so much attention yet can barely stammer out a few ugly words. 

She stopped, held out her hand. *"Hi, I'm Lauren."*

*"Nice to meet --"*   ***"SHANE! This bed isn't fixing itself."***

*"Thanks boss. Thanks. I'll be right there. So yeah, nice to meet you."*

I must have looked like a kicked puppy because he apologized once I stepped into the workshop and closed the door. 

Lauren worked in food services, taking patients orders and delivering the food. I saw her often because I went from room to room fixing things and she went room to room filing bellies and lightening dark rooms with her eyes and smile. We talked a bit and something magical happened. She used my real name. I wasn't Shane to her. Do you know what it feels like to hear your name for the first time? It's impossible to describe but I took every chance to talk to her, just to hear her say it. We actually have a lot in common. Dancing, sports, same strange obsession with eating hot peppers. And by the end of the day exchanged numbers, planning on going out to dance tonight. If that goes well I hope to ask her over on Sunday to watch the game. 

During one of our three hundred conversations (I know, I know, pathetic) I drummed up the courage to ask her about the person she replaced. She didn't know much, except that her name was Lauren also. 

God, it felt so good to hear my name. I could listen to her say it for hours. Anyway, back to the body bag. This morning I thought it was the first time I'd seen one and just attributed it to a great hospital staff and modern medicine. But now I remember seeing a body rolled past me once before but I didn't realize what was happening at the time. It was my first day at work. Now that I think about it, it was the same two people pushing the body down the hallway. Weird.

Oh yeah, Lauren is calling! Gotta go get ready. 

She said my name again when I answered. I think I'm in love. 


We danced to a few songs, drinks in hand, never spilling a drop, smiling and grinding a bit. A weird song neither of us knew came on next so we took the opportunity to get some water and talk some more. 

"How come everyone at work calls you Shane?"

Her question caught me off guard, not because it was a difficult question to answer (or maybe it was) but because I never thought anyone would ask it. And everything came flooding out of my mouth. I told her about the employee I replaced and his name somehow passing on to me, about how much I hated it, about the door I found and the two dead bodies I'd seen. About them coming on first days and how she was the first new employee I'd seen in five months. My mind finally caught up with my mouth and I firmly placed my hand over it. 

*"I'm sorry, I talk fast when I'm nervous"*, I mumbled. 

*"You know what I think? I think we need to get into the morgue and look at that body."*

*"What, when?"* I asked. 

*"Tonight."*

That last word caused my drink to reverse course, spewing from the sides of my mouth. 

She laughed a melodious laugh, tossed a few napkins at me and got up, shaking her cute butt to the beat of the newest song. Sheepishly, I cleaned the corners of my mouth and bounced up behind her in an attempt to get close once again... and close we got. A few songs later and she suggested we head back to my place to plan our break-in. 

I'm writing this from my bed, her hair tickling my arm. It was some plan. 

-------------

**UPDATE:**

I am exhausted and scared. After a short nap Lauren and I got dressed for work, only we were going in seven hours early. Her plan was simple and flawless, or so I thought after a few drinks and an orgasm. A word to the wise, never trust your brain after sex. Anyway, the hospital is usually a ghost town after about 5PM in the basement because that is where all of the maintenance, facilities, cleaning type of workers have their offices and of course that is where the morgue. 

We came in through a door that doesn't need badge access but isn't a main entrance either so as not to be spotted and crept down to the basement. I had been here before at this time answering an on-call from the ICU department and it didn't seem creepy or frightening then but it certainly did now. The quiet was tangible, pressing against me with each step. Coincidentally the door that I found and the morgue are in the same large warehouse so I took Lauren over to it and showed her. 

Squatting down to get a good look with her I noticed the door was slightly damp and one of the plugs was missing from the two central holes that a handle probably fits into. While she ran her fingers over the door's seam I searched the immediate area for the plug, praying it wasn't me who lost it when I first discovered the door. I almost let out a whoop when I found it and pushed it back into it's home but when I did some liquid forced its way up and out of the hole. There was no noticeable scent to it, or strange feel or texture. It seemed to just be water. I guess the strangest thing about it was that ONLY the door was damp, not even a tiny portion of the surrounding floor. 

Instead of wasting too much time with a door I couldn't open we made our way over to the huge steel door that lead into the morgue. As I have said before, I have a lot of master keys and a few master codes to keypad doors. Fortunately one of them was the right one and after a few tries I was able to get the door open. We stepped inside of a small, chilly chamber just big enough for four people. In the center was a sleek steel table about eight feet long. On the left and right of the entrance were matching steel work tables, covered in gleaming surgical tools. 

Drills. Saws. Hundreds of scalpels of all shapes and sizes. Steel bowls and bins. Forceps. An industrial sink with huge over-head handles like in a restaurant. 

On the far wall was what we came in here for. Four steel doors with bodies behind them. 

I took a deep breath, shivered a bit from the cold air entering my lungs, and stepped across the room. One hand on the handle and one hand gripping Lauren, I pulled. Empty.

We locked eyes for a second, relief on both of our faces. I am not sure what we thought we would find in the first one but apparently both of our imaginations were running wild. I gripped the next one and pulled. Empty. The third, empty. The fourth, not empty. 

SHIT.

Another deep breath and I grabbed the sliding tray with both hands. It slide out easily on well maintained rollers and so did the Taco Bell we had on the way to the hospital. Staring up at us was Lauren. The old Lauren. The one that was replaced.

I couldn't breath, I couldn't think. I slammed the tray back in, shutting the door. Shit, vomit everywhere. Never eat Taco Bell. Never never. I leaped two steps over to one of the sinks and grabbed the over-head handle. The water stream was powerful and freezing cold. It blasted the vomit toward the drain underneath the center table easily and after a few seconds the floor looked brand new. 

*"Hello?"*

We ran.

<TEXT> 

Sorry about the delay. I was out of state at my brothers wedding. So. Much. Fun! I never realized I enjoyed dancing so much. I don't think I have ever been to a club or really ever danced at a wedding or party, either. Definitely going out this weekend to keep the party alive. During the reception I was talking to a few buddies and they were excited about the Super Bowl and how big their party was going to be, yada yada. That was when I realized that I had never thrown one myself. Or even been to one. Weird. I was in a pretty good mood heading back in to work until I clocked in and had my first "hello" from a co-worker. God, I hate that name so much. Shane. Shane. At least the time-clock knows what my name really is.

As I cruised around the hospital from repair request to the next my mind wandered back to that door I had found and I started to plan how I could get a fair amount of alone time with it to investigate. A few of our machines make a permanent home down in the basement but as long as we own them they need to be maintained so I decided I'd volunteer to take the lot of them on and get them calibrated for the year. All I needed was some tools and our calibration system to take down to them and I can work on them all day. My boss agreed quickly, probably because he doesn't want to do it, and so the next day I gathered up what I needed and headed down.

Once in the basement I laid out all of my calibration equipment and tools in a neat row and positioned all of the equipment that needed to be worked on around me in a circle, one so that I could access each one rather easily and two so that I could be mostly blocked from all views while I messed with the door that I placed strategically inside with me. I was about halfway through the first machine when I took a break to check out the real reason I was down there. Grabbing my mini Maglite and soft bristled brush I went to work trying to find a real seam or gap that I could wiggle a screwdriver into. As I worked it became increasingly more obvious that this was not supposed to be found. I'll do my best to describe my findings now.

The door is 16 inches by 16 inches perfectly square and 1/4th of an inch lower than the floor around it. It is perfectly level and has two small holes drilled into the middle nine inches apart. I couldn't see the holes before because they were filled in with some type of soft putty insert that matches the color of the floor, like a temporary plug. The holes are only an inch or so deep from what I can tell with the Maglite. The outer seam is also filled with that putty but more like caulking in this case and the seam is only 1/8th of an inch thick. This door is designed well! So well that it pushes my curiosity further and further into skepticism and fear. I have read enough r/nosleep and SCP articles to know when I am in too deep but somehow I am driven forward. Call it blind stupidity.

I could probably have finished up all of the equipment down there in one day but I knew that I needed to find the handle that lifted up that door so I took my time instead and split it up into two days. When I came in the next day an idea came to me. Maybe I could make my own handle. We have a huge parts room that rivals any hardware store. Surely I could cobble together something that fit the threads and be able to lift it up so I went and grabbed a few different sized bolts and washers to see what I could fabricate.

All of the first batch were too big but on the next visit I hit pay dirt with an eye-hook screw. Using an old power cable I threaded through both of the eye-hooks I had my handle. Giving it a tug was futile, however. Even getting into a deep squat and using my entire body I couldn't even feel the door give one bit. The cord snapped, I lost my balance and tumbled back into the equipment I had circled around, making a massive crash. Several people ran to the noise and fortunately I had enough time to get my eye-hooks out before anyone noticed.

*"Are you OK, Shane?! What happened?"*

Holding back a low growl I responded with a lame "I tripped" excuse and went back to work on one of the pieces of equipment.

*"Oh Shane, always being so clumsy! Do you remember the time Shane.."* Everyone walked out shaking their head and laughing and sharing stories of my clumsiness. The only problem is that I had never done any of the things that they talked about. Not a single one.

----------

UPDATE:

The episode today at work really freaked me out. I tried to distract myself by driving around, going into some stores but nothing could take my mind off of it so I went home and made some calls. First I called the hospital that Shane took a new job at to see if I could speak to him. The guy I spoke to said there weren't any Shane's working in Biomed. I asked a few questions, maybe he is in maintenance or something but still no Shane. With shaking hands I called a few more hospitals in search of Shane, then more, then all in the entire metro. No one had a Shane.

For some reason I called the first hospital back and asked to speak to the hiring manager this time. What he told me made my blood go cold. Yes, they hired Shane, but he never showed up to work.

I hopped onto Facebook next in hopes of finding a recent post by Shane and alleviate my fears. Shane hasn't made a post or picture or status for YEARS! Looking back thru his history he stopped posting a few months after joining my hospital. What is even more disturbing is that his only friends are coworkers. He used to have friends but must have removed them all. His last post had comments from other people, family it looks like based on last name, and a few school buddies. All of them appeared worried about something.

It didn't take long to dig thru his old posts because of the rarity of them so I started looking at my coworkers pages. After a few people I noticed a trend and after several hours of checking I have condoned that every single person that I work with is ONLY friends with coworkers. Not a single extra friend out of every person I could find. God, just typing that out makes me sick and cold inside.

Anyway, while I was out I decided to finally get a new TV so I picked up a 60 inch 4K Samsung for my football party this Sunday. I'm going to have everyone over for each game our team is still in the playoffs. I'd keep blabbing on but I'm off to go dancing. I'll update my progress with the door tomorrow.

<TEXT> 
My name is not Shane.

I just wanted to clarify that right now. Four months ago I began my career as a Biomedical Technician at a local hospital. It wasn't the best paying job and it was not as close as my last job to home but it was a start. Getting a foot in the door is the hardest part from what I understand. Anyway, my co-worker was really nice and the rest of the staff at the hospital seemed kind enough. Always waving and smiling. And never learning my name.

I attributed it to being new at first but even people I saw every day never remembered it. They could remember the once-a-week contractor just fine, but me? Nope.

Normally this wouldn't bother me because I have a hard time remembering peoples names as well and I have been known to say the wrong name from time to time. It started to bother me, however, when I had every single name memorized and NO ONE had mine. Petty? Maybe. But try it for a few months and tell me it doesn't get ridiculously annoying and belittling. What was even more strange is that everyone called me the same wrong name....

Shane.

After a month I was "let loose" from the training label and started to move a little more freely around the hospital instead of having to follow my co-worker around like a lost puppy. A part of our job is to do repairs on all of the equipment so I have the master code to all keypad locks and a few keys that will open basically any door in the hospital. In my down-time I'd wander around and explore, opening up random closets in search for lost equipment and to better understand the layout of the hospital (and to find a great hideout when I wanted to just sit and watch YouTube videos).

A few months of poking around and I had peeked into just about every room I could find but one day as I was looking thru some old equipment in the basement storage for a missing ECG machine I found a door. There was no key, no keypad, no lock, virtually no seams either. And it was on the floor. Once I cleared the clutter away I squatted down to inspect it.

Was it a drain? No, that didn't make any sense. Was it access to a sub-basement? Shouldn't even be one, all of our plumbing is here and our boilers are outside.

Just as I started to run my fingers along the very faint crease my body cringes from the sound I hate most.

"Shane? Shaaaaaaneee."

"Ya over here, and it's NOT Shane. Did you find the ECG?"

"Sure did, let's test it to make sure it still works."

Days went by but I couldn't get that strange "door" out of my head so I let myself into our records room that has all of the blueprints and schematics for the hospital hoping to find an answer. None. Not one damn mention of anything being underneath the basement storage. No electrical. No plumbing. Nothing. Undeterred, I make it a point to keep digging when I have time. I even made a daily alarm on my phone.

The next day during lunch my co-worker and I were talking about football and how we couldn't wait for the season to start. Our team was going to be very good this year, you know. Apparently the guy that I replaced was a huge football fan. Tailgated every Sunday, had huge parties for the Superbowl, that kind of thing. I had never heard anyone talk about him before so I asked what happened. It seemed like a sour subject because my co-worker just mumbled a bit about him not giving any notice and taking another job downtown at the school hospital. [Oddly enough I had applied for the same job but after making it to the final three candidates I was knocked out. Lack of experience, they said.]

"Sorry he skipped out on you like that. What was his name?"

"Shane."

<TITLE> Room 13 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-20 20:44:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Some hospitals are superstitious and some are not. Some have a room 13 or a room 666 or a floor 13 if they are large enough and others skip right past those numbers as if they hold the very power of hell in their plastic placards. Mine falls into the superstitious category, maybe to an unhealthy degree. Our rooms are numbered based on the floor so first floor are all 100 rooms while second floor are 200 rooms and so on which is pretty standard. None of the floors have a room 13. 

I work in the Emergency Department as a security guard. Why is a security guard necessary? Because we admit mentally unhealthy and unstable patients on a daily basis I am there to ensure they do not hurt themselves or the staff treating them. On occasion I have to deal with an irate patient due to wait times or someone screaming about a bill but those dont happen too often. 

As a large and imposing man I am not easily frightened and I am not particularly superstitious. Everything has a reason, everything can be explained. Maybe that nave way of thinking stemmed from the little education I received, small town upbringing, or my parents being such practical, no-fuss people living in a black and white world. No matter the reason behind it, it was sorely incorrect. 

With that being said I should probably get to the reason I am even writing this out in the first place. Something happened last night during my shift that I simply cant explain and has shaken me to the core. The shift started out in standard fashion and I settled in quickly with a huge coffee and the funnies to browse through. We only had one of three mental health rooms occupied, suicide watch, so not bad at all. I dont think in the seven years I had worked here that we ever received anyone overnight. Peak hours were first thing in the morning and right after work lets out. That is when the guys in business suits and nice cars think their life is awful and try slamming into something at highway speeds or jump off of a bridge into rush hour traffic. 

I was half a page in and already chuckling when I heard a soft voice whispering. Glancing up I see the young teen pressed against the small safety-glass window murmuring wide-eyed. I couldnt make out what she was saying but her eyes got my attention right away and I nudged the nurse dozing off next to me. Her eyes were completely red. I dont mean bloodshot from being tired or a burst vessel. I am talking no pupil, no whites - nothing but a dark unwavering red staring back at me. 

The nurse jumped up and I followed, opening the room and making sure she didnt find something to hurt herself with. The rooms are bare except for the bed they sleep on and those are specially designed but things have happened in the past. The patient turned to us as we walked in and continued to whisper the same phrase over and over again: *He is in room 13.* The nurse tried talking to her without much effect but she did get her back to her bed to take vitals and allowed us to check her eyes. I stood two steps back as a precaution but she just sat there on the edge of the bed staring at me with her unblinking red eyes whispering.

When the nurse was satisfied with her readings and found no obvious reason for the eye condition we stepped outside of the room and discussed what we saw with the charge nurse and a doctor. I went back in with the doctor as he looked her over and did his best to ask some questions but got nothing out of her except *He is in room 13.* I am not sure but from what I heard in the discussion she shouldnt be having such a sudden change and no one really had an answer to why or how her eyes took on the red color. I did my best not to interject but no one seemed to be asking the question that was on my mind.

Umm, pardon me, but why is she saying someone is in room 13?

The doctor and nurse stared at me for a moment before both shrugged it off. She is not in her right state of mind. Probably just something she saw in a movie. As far as I know she doesnt realize we have no room 13.

With that they went down the hall discussing treatment options and further testing. I sat for a moment just staring at the room. I knew I couldnt leave  she must be supervised. I knew we didnt have a room 13. Yet something pulled at me, twisting and digging its way inside past the barriers of reasoning and stubbornness. My eyes flicked from left to right and back, searching for anyone who could be around to take my place or witness me leave my post. No one in sight, an eerie calm hanging over a normally loud and busy department, I stood and took a step to my right when a bloody hand smacked hard into the window of her room. 

I charged the room and threw the door open praying she was still alive but I found her sitting cross-legged on the floor with her head down as blood seeped into the gown between her thighs. She looked up at me, her face twisted in agony and defeat. Marks began forming on her arms and legs as if an imaginary belt lashed out repeatedly striking her exposed skin. I screamed into my mini-cell for the nurse and doctor ASAP and tried to get anything out of her as to what she did. I couldnt find anything resembling a weapon on her person or in the room. A few moments passed but two nurses rushed in with the doctor and quickly assessed her for injuries.

I took the moment to slip out and power-walked down the hall to room 14 but to my shock a man sat quietly in room 13, a room we never before had. As I stared dumbly at him he noticed I had approached and asked when someone would be taking a look at him. He had a broken nose and deep scratches up and down his arms. I informed him a nurse would be by soon and went to track one down. When I stated there was a man in room 13 that needed attention he didnt bat an eye but jaunted on down and popped into the room. I couldnt wrap my mind around what was going on so I went back to my post and check on the girl. 

She was gone. No blood, not even the handprint on the window. I checked the log to see if someone had checked her out for transport to another facility I noticed that she had already been checked out several hours before my shift had even started. Not just checked out but deceased. Questions were exploding out of my mouth faster than my tongue could keep up but just as the nurse was about to look up the man from room 13 sprinted past, IV pole bouncing along behind him and two nurses chasing. My instincts and training kicked in and I took off after him and apprehended him against the wall before he could hit the exit button that opened the double doors. 

The staff had found blood under his nails while treating his wounds and ran some tests. It matched the girl. Once in custody they found other traces of her on him from what I am told. I think they are searching his home now for clues, hoping to crack other unsolved cases from the past. The rest of my shift blurred by  I even had to be reminded to leave when the dayshift guard came in to relieve me. I walked down the hallway to the locker room to get changed and stopped when I came to room 12. Then 14. When I turned back to look again at the placard on the wall in front of room 12 I saw who I think was the girl, a faint glimmer or silhouette, accompanied by an even fainter *Thank you*.

I think that what little I knew of this world just got a lot smaller.

<TEXT> I won't pretend to fully understand the motives behind this article but I can relate in my own way. Forgiveness is not something that needs to be asked but rather something that midday be given of your own accord. I wish everyone would sincerely ask for forgiveness because if they did it would mean they are actively seeking to change their behavior. 

Another wish of mine is that everyone didn't treat life like there is always a tomorrow to make it right. You never know when your time comes to an end so please don't wait. This goes for all things, whether it be a hobby you want to try, an emotion you must express, whatever. Stop waiting. 

I'm probably way off base but those are the things the article made me think of. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> To answer you question measures already have been taken. The length of stories in a series were increased to 1000 words including the original post. 

If you believe other measures should be taken that are enforceable by the mods message them. 

The issue you are having with supposed quality is across the board, not just series posts. But that is the beauty of NoSleep. Hacks like me and amateur writers are able to express themselves in a public forum. 

I suggest you sit back, relax, and enjoy the good ones as they come along. If you see plot holes in an otherwise great story pm the author and let them know. That way next time they can be cognizant of such things and give a better product. 

Have a great night.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some of you, especially if you live in the Midwest, know about Etzanoa. For those that dont Ill give a brief account of the city and its people. Several hundred years ago the Native Americans rules this continent. For the most part they were tribal and nomadic with free reign to move about as the seasons dictated. However, there were exceptions to this with large, permanent settlements such as Cahokia and Etzanoa supporting upwards of 20,000 people.

As history and legend have it Juan de Onate and seventy soldiers discovered a sprawling settlement of Wichita Indians poised between two rivers. When the Indians saw the Spaniards they fled and left their city. Once inside Onate explored the city and the size of the city alone unnerved them so much that they turned and retreated only to find a rival tribe coming in behind them. Onate stated that the rival tribe was surprised at their presence, indicating that they were actually there to attack Etzanoa. The Spaniards hunkered down and fired cannonballs out into the surrounding area hoping to scare off the warriors, which they eventually did. 

Why is this relevant, you might be asking yourself? For the past two years I have been working on site in Arkansas City, Kansas with a small team of student archeologists and Donald Blankeslee at the head. During that time we have uncovered undeniable evidence of the once-thought impossible city. What you will find in the news is that Blankeslee has confirmed the tale of Onate and his battle near a massive city. Cannonballs have been recovered, tons of flint objects, pottery, tools, and remains of building structures including a fully operational water shrine. 

Some of that is true, but mostly misinformation. Yes, the city existed, yes the Spanish were there, and yes we found a shrine. That is where the similarities stop. What we actually found was five times the size! Twenty five miles of Indian metropolis stretching as far as you can see in all directions. They completely dominated the area between the rivers and the surrounding hills in a manner never seen before. What I found to be the most surprising is that we found no walls, no battlements, no defense systems whatsoever. It was as if they had nothing to fear at all.

In the exact center of the city is a beautiful and ornate shrine designed with incredible skill and intricacy. At what would have been the highest point in the city stood six columns, four at each corner most likely supporting an open roof to allow the sun and moonlight to pierce through, and two smaller columns spaced four feet apart adorned with massive chains. The floor resembled a pyramid, sloping gently away from the center and opening to four aqueducts at the edge of the platform on which the columns stood. These aqueducts branched over and over as they moved down and spread to a trough that circled the shrine at its base. If you are having trouble visualizing it I could sketch something quickly but Im not an artist so it probably wont help.

The aqueducts were fashioned out of gold and each side of the shrine had its own design. It was clear this was not just a water shrine but one of sacrifice and service to a god or multiple gods. The sun god, moon god, harvest god? After weeks of studying the sides of the shrine I realized each one was a symbol and therefore must have meaning. We poured over every text and book we could get our hands on and finally found what each of the symbols means. Blood. Protection. Monster. Annual. It reminded me of the movie King Kong where they sacrifice someone to the giant gorilla in exchange for peace or for general worship.

Along the base of the shrine we also found several mounds which ended up being hundreds of skulls. In total we counted over one thousand individual skulls. What was interesting and horrifying was the condition of the skulls  they were all completely intact without blemish or any sign of damage and they were all from children. I truly believe these skulls are the remains of each sacrifice, which means if it truly was only a once per year ritual that these people lived here over one thousand years giving up their children to appease the gods. 

That really got me to thinking. Why would the Wichita turn and flee from a few Spanish if they were so numerous? They clearly ruled the land and feared nothing so even a few cannons should not have stopped them from decimating Onate and his men. And why would a rival tribe sent only a few hundred men to attack Etzanoa in the first place? Something was not adding up and I wanted to figure it out. As more and more of the ruins were uncovered we started to see a pattern in the homes and other buildings  it resembled Pompeii! Whole families huddled together arms locked across shoulders to protect the young which crouched inside. Each and every skeleton was missing the head.

It was a bone-chilling sight as we went from room to room finding only headless corpses all in the same position. I couldnt help but feel like I was being watched, but more than that, being judged, as I passed from hut to hut. I didnt stay down there long. A fear kept bubbling inside of me that I couldnt shake and after about fifteen huts I quickly made my way back to the surface and fresh air. Before the fear drove me out of that valley of death I did notice one other thing in each home  the symbol for Monster. 

Small, precise, and painstakingly burned into each of the main entryways was the symbol. Protection? Maybe. Reverence? Possibly. But maybe something even worse than that. A mark, made by the monster itself as it passed through each home. You see, I think that their protection ran out. Maybe they had no more children to sacrifice but that seems unlikely due to the size of the place. 

Want to know what I think? I think the Spanish interrupted the ceremony and angered the Monster/god to such an extent that it ravaged the land and all those in its path. I think Onate fled at the first sign of trouble and ran into a tribe on their way to the ritual and while they battled it out in order to flee the entire city of Etzanoa suffered the wrath of their once-protector  the Wendigo. 

That is why youll never hear about any of these details being found. I dont know if Blankeslee is being silenced or if he is working for someone in order to keep it silent. I want to know what else they uncover but I dont want to go back there, I dont feel safe. Almost as if it is still nearby, watching and waiting for the next ritual.

<TITLE> Anisometropia </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-18 20:26:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Three quarters of American adults use some type of corrective eyewear. Can you believe that? I can because I have worn glasses my entire life. Granted it was eye-patches as a baby but glasses from as long as I can remember. Optometrists tell you all kinds of statistics during the exams and I have been to hundreds so my head is full of useless knowledge about eyes. How they work, common issues, you name it. 

I have the unfortunate fate of falling into a particularly rare issue, or rather, block of issues that culminated into two incredibly useless eyes. I was born with extreme anisometropia and aniseikonia which resulted in astigmatism and amblyopia. What that means is that one eye is incredibly near-sighted while the other is incredibly far-sighted. Usually eyes will work together but mine fight each other causing my brain to pick one image over the other. After almost two decades my brain has finally figured out how to use one eye or the other without fighting as much so depending on what I am looking at the depth of that object determines which eye snaps into focus. This means that one eye is constantly rolling around doing nothing until its turn to focus.

Sometimes surgery will correct it but the five that I have had so far havent done too much. They kept me from going blind, sure, but not much else. Doctors have tried everything but they are at the edge of technology and unless another breakthrough occurs me and my eyes are out of luck. I tell you all of this because I think I see things others do not. I can hear the jokes now so save them. *The practically blind guy sees things we cant? Pshhh* Trust me when I say you dont want to see the things I see. 

I am not certain whether or not I have always seen them and not noticed or if this is something new, a side-effect of the latest surgery maybe. All my life I have had incredible peripheral vision  the one benefit of having endlessly wandering eyes. Even though they are not entirely focused on it I do pick up on things off to the sides that others would not normally see and then can turn to focus my eyes on them. They has saved me many a time from the vicious bullies throughout my school years trying to sneak up behind me. You can probably imagine the endless torment I have received with literal googley-eyes-syndrome as my wonderful contemporaries like to call me. But now the one positive factor I have had about all of this is betraying me. 

During one of the latest run-ins with a group of jerks I thought I saw a slap coming from the left side so I threw a hand up and flinched away to the right, directly into the slap that actually came from that side. My head rang and my cheek was instantly streaked with tears (I have over-active tear ducts as well) and my ears were filled with harsh, barking laughter from all around me. I guess the psychic is losing his touch! HAHAHAHAHA! Crying from one little slap? Baby bitch! Normally I would stand up for myself, even fight back at times, but not today. My mind was trying to grasp what I had thought I had seen to the left. It was a fast moving blur. What was it? I looked around past the ring of future societal rejects in a vain attempt to track down what could have caused it. 

Pushing past them I stayed vigilant on my way to class hoping to see it again. I am not sure why I was so obsessed with the blur but something about it nagged at me, agitated me. I tried to pay attention all through anatomy class (it was actually my favorite subject) but I kept getting distracted by flitting images at the edge of my periphery. Normally I wouldnt be bothered by this, I am used to it after all, but today it was different. They were different. 

How can I describe it? Have you even been poked in the eye and your vision is blurry? You can make out shapes and colors and maybe because you are familiar with your surroundings you even know what it is you are looking at despite the blur and tears obscuring your view. That is what these were like except everything around them was clear. Like oil in water, they only disturbed the space they took up and nothing more. And, just like oil in water, they didnt belong. I was sure of that more than I was sure of anything else. 

------------------

That was three weeks ago. 

I havent gone out much because it has become much worse. I see them more and more, yet I dont see them. No matter how fast I turn, no matter how much I anticipate their movements I cant catch them. But I think they are getting closer  a horrible ink blot moving sinuously through the air. They seem to take up more of my periphery whereas before it was just a flicker in the far corner. How they are closer yet impossible to see I still dont know. 

Something else, something new, I can see them at night. Even in the deepest recesses of shadow they undulate and defy my vision. They are a different kind of darkness, darker than the absence of light? How?

I sit here in bed with my phone as dim as possible in order to perform tests. As I type this out they draw nearer. When I raise the brightness to the maximum they draw nearer. The only thing I can do is turn to look. Then, and only then, do they vanish. But what if the next time I turn they dont?

I gave my eyes a rest and I can see them still, clearer, closer, taking up more of my field of view. What do they want? I used to get respite when I turned my head. Now I push them closer to the center. 

Eyes closed. Dont look, dont stare. 

LOOK! Open your eyes! 

They are in my eyes. Insideeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

-------------

I can see your future - You dont have much time. If you start to see them dont look, dont acknowledge them. It might give you more time.

<TEXT> As for the first question just put a series tag on it and link the first hell post as "related". The context will be enough to know it is the same universe. 

And to answer the second - I liked it. It is good. However I think it is too watered down. Spice it up so that it doesn't blend in with the other dental stories. If I'm being honest I was never scared and I guessed the general issue right away. 

Maybe cut away to the doctors perspective out in the amazon when she first discovered such an issue. The entire tribe was suffering and the scene was gruesome. Describe in detail how the bodies were littered with millions of centipedes and you only found a few still alive to know what had happened. 

Maybe it is only a certain kind of fruit that we need to be wary of or a brand of toothpaste has a weird chemical in it that brings them out of dormancy.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I Hate Saturday </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-16 04:44:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A shrill beeping startled me into consciousness and I blinked against the harsh overhead lights. A horrible chemical taste filled my mouth and as I brought my hands up to rub at my puffy eyes they quickly halted and pain shot up my arms. Cold metal dug mercilessly into my wrists, catching my full attention and snapping me immediately out of the post-sleep stupor. It must be Saturday again.

My wife shuffled over to the oven and pressed a few buttons, ending the beeping and letting out a wave of heat as she reached inside and pulled out a dish. My stomach gurgled and turned at the smell and the thought of what was about to happen once again. How did I let her get me again? I needed to stop letting my guard down.

"Time for dinner, hunnie!" Her chipper voice and gently swaying hips made it all the worse. How could she?!

A full plate was placed in front of me, assaulting my eyes and nose with the horrible stench and repulsive sight of what was about to be forced into my body. "Please don't" I pleaded, "I wasn't raised like you.... I can't eat that shit!"

I fought hard against the handcuffs but my arms were crossed and cuffed individually to the chair. My feet were constrained in a similar manner but to the table legs which were strong and sturdy. I had managed to break free the first night but there was no escaping this. My legs were stretched out in front of me so that I could not get purchase to stand and my arms tight behind me. I tried rolling to the side but only lost skin on my ankles and quickly came back to the center of my prison. 

A loving smile never left her face as she sliced through the viscera before me and soon had a perfect fork-full, moving steadily toward me. I clenched my jaw and pressed my tongue as hard as I could against the backs of my teeth in an attempt to keep it out. I could feel it rubbing against my thin-set lips.

"Open up or we will do this the hard way."

I took one look at the fork, then stole a glance her way. I knew she wasn't bluffing but I couldn't willingly open my mouth. She sighed and set the fork down, reaching for the harness she made that fit into my nose and around my neck. I threw my head back and forth and tried to snap at her hands but eventually, she had it around my head and the plugs pushed up into my nostrils.

A small amount of oxygen made it past the plastic and cloth but not enough. Soon my lungs were burning and I chanced a small breath through pressed teeth. Her hand was swift, slapping at my Adam's apple and I gagged, gasping for air. The fork found its way inside before I could blink and my stomach turned once again. 

Just being on my tongue sent tears streaming down my cheeks and my gag reflex increased to a code red. The little piece slid around on my tongue no matter how still I tried to be. The texture of it alone was enough to loosen the snot in my nose and it began to run down and around the plugs. Soon my beard was full of snot and salty tears.

"You have nine more pieces to go so you better hurry up. You know it is better when it is warm."

I stared at her with hatred, wishing innumerable evil upon her and bit down into the horrible filth she forced into my palette. Revulsion coursed through me and I shivered, goosebumps covering my entire body. My butthole puckered and fresh tears followed the salty paths to my chin. I could feel the juices sliding down my throat and the stringy meat coated my teeth. Two quick bites to mash it up as best as I could before tilting my head back and forcing it down. It spread its tendrils of pulp out as it slid down into my stomach. I highly doubted it would stay there long. Another piece made its way toward me on the fork and I let out a sob. 

"Please, I just can't. Don't make me do this. If you loved me-"

I was cut off when the fork jammed into my mouth and into my tongue. I pulled back instinctively from the pain and bit down accidently into the piece. The juices exploded in all directions and I choked once, twice, and the first piece came back up along with whatever she had drugged me with.

She tsked, cleaned it up, and pressed another piece toward me once more. 

I really fucking hate squash.

<TEXT> Hunnie, we need to talk.

When I didnt get a response I kept going. Look, I dont know how to start, what to say. I messed up. Hunnie, I am so sorry.

Tears were streaming down my face before I knew it and I couldnt control them. My face was contorted with fear, shame, guilt.

I am not going to make excuses or blame one thing or another. After managing to control my emotions somewhat I continued. I am having an affair.

I paused there, waiting for some kind of response. Some backlash. Emotion. Anything. When I received none of it I hung my head, dried my tears, and walked out the door with a bag full of clothes. 

I stopped, turning one last time at the screen door and hoped she would be looking my way. When she wasnt I whispered Im sorry and headed for my car.

Sobs overcame me again after just a few blocks and I pulled the car over until they passed. Around the same time I regained my composure my phone rang and I answered it, hoping for my wife of eighteen years.

How did it go, a voice as sweet as honey asked me through the speaker?

It didnt. Not really. I confessed, planned on telling her everything. She never even looked at me or uttered a word. It was like she already knew and it didnt bother her. A fresh sob exploded out of my chest but was quelled quickly by the soft and gentle words sliding into my ear.

Shhh now, it is OK. I told you she would be fine about it. Now we can be together with a clear conscious. Why dont you come over and Ill draw you a bath, hmm?

A hot bath did sound nice, especially after a long day at the construction site and now this. Guilt crept up slowly as I put mile after mile between the house and my car. Halfway to my girlfriends house and I couldnt take it any longer. I crossed four lanes of traffic and popped over the median in a frantic U-turn. Horns blared and tires screeched all around me but I slammed my foot on the gas pedal and left the chaotic scene behind me. I needed her to acknowledge this!

The engine roared as I swerved and weaved through manicured streets filled with kids and their parents playing games and riding bikes. The tires ripped huge chunks of thick green grass out of the lawn and I flung the door open leaving the engine running. Four long steps got me to the front door and I burst inside. Why I was so angry I still dont know, but angry I was. 

Helen! Helen, I need to know you heard me. Helen?!

I sprinted through the home slamming open every door but she was nowhere to be found. Where could she have gone? I checked the garage but her car was still there. None of her clothes were missing. The door was still unlocked just as I had left it when I exited earlier. I grabbed for the cordless phone on the wall and started to punch in numbers.

Hi, Gary? Yea its me, have you heard from Helen? No, what? No, I just saw her today. Slow down! Why would you say that about your daughter?

I hung up, not able to listen anymore to the horrible things he had to say. 

The police found me about an hour later curled up in a ball on my bed holding our wedding picture. Gary had called, worried about my health and safety. I didnt fight when they took me down to the police station for questioning and evaluation. I passed the eval, of course. I wasnt crazy, I had just forgotten. Maybe that is the wrong word. I had not wanted to believe it and therefore didnt. 

They showed me some pictures and took me out back to the impound where they still had the car. It was smashed so badly only one of the four doors was visible, my door. How I managed to survive I will never know but she did not. The police still dont know why the car failed the way it did which is I guess why they still have it in the first place. The guilt washed away then, replaced by a fresh wave of sadness just as the tide moves in and out. 

I still get sad from time to time but Elana helps. She is such a great woman. I figured she would leave after I explained everything to her, my wife being dead and me being crazy and acting like she was alive all these long months. But she just smiled her soft smile and reassured me that we were meant to be together. It is hard to argue with a beautiful woman while soaking in a hot bath. 

Helen never appreciated you, you know.

I turned my head to respond and that is when I noticed a picture frame on the counter. It was a small silver frame with a picture of Elana and I on a hike through Big Sur. But she never went hiking with me in Big Sur, Helen did.

<TEXT> Hi there, just a few things. 

1. I found the story to be a bit too choppy. I like going back and forth from past to present but maybe it was done at the wrong times or needs some polishing. 

2. I was never really scared or alarmed or worried. You need to have some real scare factor of some kind. 

3. It was a bit predictable in its ending. 

4. There are some typos and a misuse of a few words. I think you meant to use a different word but typed out another. 

I enjoyed reading it. It just needs some tweaking and a lot more scare.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Pleasure. Pain. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-08 00:38:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I dont recall the first time I felt that warm, flowing sensation between my legs. I must have been young because I always seem to remember knowing about it. I just cant pinpoint the first time. I do, however, remember my first orgasm. 



We had just moved into a new home and I had my own bathroom for the first time in my short life. The first thing I did when I was all unpacked was take a nice, hot shower in my own personal bathroom. Steam filled the room quickly and soon I was covered in soapy bubbles. The best part was how the shower head could be taken off of the wall and move around. No longer would I need to bend over or hike up a leg to get all the soap off. I could just aim the water exactly where I needed it! Soon enough I found out *exactly* where I needed it. My parents water bill probably increased quite a bit that month.



Id call that my Awakening. From there I began to experiment. A Sharpie was my first toy. I have never told anyone about this or even asked questions relating to it out of embarrassment so I dont know if I progressed faster than most girls or if I was just another normal teenage girl. One Sharpie led to two. Sharpies led to hair brush handles. Brush handles let to carrots and cucumbers.



Each stage in my adventures thrilled me more than the next. The thrill just didnt last very long. I had to find something new, something bigger or better. Something to bring me back to that first night in my shower. 



-----------------------------



Friends gossip and some of my friends were talking about what they did with their boyfriends. It sounded like a lot of fun and maybe, just maybe, it would fill the void I kept searching for. I am not the most beautiful girl or anything but Ive noticed a few passing glances here and there. One of those glances came from a tall, muscular boy in my gym class. He was *gorgeous* and pretty popular as well, which made his glances all the better. Id get wet just thinking about it!



Within a week he was mine and I was his. I didnt know how to go about these things with a boy but he seemed to know a lot. It is different with a boy. Better. Maybe it is because I dont know what he is thinking so I am kept guessing. When it is just me I already know what I am going to do. The only bad side of it is how short he lasts. Doesnt he know I want it all the time? If I could have him inside me every minute of the day I would!



Our first time together was amazing for about a minute. I begged and pleaded for more and after a while he obliged. I guess boys and girls are very different because he started getting really tired while I was just getting started. I was wide awake when he passed out next to me. It was still nice and hard, glistening with what we had engaged in, beckoning me over. I played with it a little and before I knew it I had cut it off and pushed it back inside. It felt sooooo good and warm  but only for a few seconds. Boys are so stupid. He was screaming and bleeding all over but that didnt last too long. It took much longer to clean up than it did to have sex. 



So after that I gave up on boys. They were too much work for such little reward, you know? I began to experiment again and soon found out that I enjoy a little pain. If I added some pain even one Sharpie felt good again! I was so excited! I found this website that sold all kinds of fun things and used my babysitting money to buy it all. Clamps and tassels and oils and things that move and shake and wiggle. My eyes were bigger than my you know, because one of the things I ordered was almost the size of my arm!



Of course all of these fun things only lasted a little while. Once I try something I cant go back, you know? Always forward. I really want to try the huge one but I think it is more like a joke or something because there is no way it would fit, right? Maybe I will try once just to make sure.



Well the joke was on them because after just a few snips I was able to get it to fit and it feels so good! I just had to make like two or three little cuts so that I could open up a little more, you know? And all the blood makes it so easy to move back and forth. When I say it is big, I mean HUGE. I have to stand up and kind of squat onto it. 



------



Ugh so I just got back from school and all the girls are such bitches. Seriously, I just hate them all. I was in senior gym and I think one of my cuts re-opened so I was bleeding all over and all the girls started to make fun of me like it was my first period or something. They kept calling me Carrie, whatever that means. And then they said I was so gross I scared all the boys away (because my boyfriend hasnt been to school all week) so they think he ran away and switched schools just to get away from me. Stupid bitches. I threw a basketball at one of them and hit her right in her dumb head. 



Guess what?! She started bawling and had a broken lip, what a baby, but I got really excited by it, like if I was rubbing you know? Maybe I just like pain in general. Oh, I had an idea!



-------------



Thanks for coming over, Susan! I am just so sorry about throwing that ball at you. I was all worked up, you know?



She hesitated a bit before crossing the threshold of the home. Yeah, whatever, you know? Its cool. So why did you want to see me in person, again?



To apologize, silly. I just felt so so so bad and I know you LOVE cheesecake so I baked you one. I led her to the basement stairs. My parents remodeled the upstairs kitchen and put all the old stuff down here so I could learn without messing up their nice stuff. Whatever. Parents, right?!



She hesitated once again but the smells of freshly baked cheesecake wafted up into her nostrils and beckoned her down. One step at first, then she was down within a heartbeat.



That was so nice of you, you didnt have to do all of that. Cheesecake is a lot of work to make from scratch.



Oh it was no big deal. I LOVE cooking. Plus now we can sit and girltalk while we eat chocolate cheesecake. I pulled a chair out for her at the two-person bar table where the cake was waiting. 



I sliced the cake into eight pieces and served us each one. She dug in greedily and I nibbled while watching her. The way the chocolate coated her swollen, red lip was so sexy. I scooted out from my chair and walked around behind her, massaging her shoulders. Instantly she snapped her head up with wide eyes.



What the fuck?



Sorry, you just looked so happy eating it. I wanted to make it even better.



She jerked away from my hands and started for the stairs. Fucking weirdo. I knew I shouldnt have come over-



I tackled her from behind, driving her to the floor. She hit her head hard on the bottom step and a deep gash opened up right above her left eyebrow. I dragged her limp ass back to the unfinished part of the basement and tied her up to the stubbed water pipe that will probably never get any closer to being finished. I could feel the excitement coursing through me. Throbbing, pulsing. I was so WET! I stripped off my clothes and sat facing her bleeding face while I toyed into a climax. 



Yes, I like pain. I dont think Ill be bored for a while.

Did you ever stop to think that maybe the op is trans? That they want to empower the group as a hero in the story or simply spread awareness of the terrible treatment certain people receive?

<TEXT> I only downvote when it is clear the person just wrote a random idea on their phone without a single edit or moment of pause.

That is few and far between but it does happen. 

If I had to guess I would say I upvote 95% of the stories I read, 4.5% no vote, and 0.5% downvote. 

Maybe less deserve upvotes but I feel like many of my stories get votes they don't deserve simply from supportive community members, like a pat on the back to the new guy. Because of that I try to do the same.  </TEXT>

My eyes snapped open and my adrenaline immediately tripled. I fumbled with the sheets as I tried to untangle my sweaty legs from the cotton prison and bounded down the hallway to the security panel. I punched in the four digit code and a womans friendly voice greeted me several seconds later.

This is Watchful Skies operator 212, we received a motion detection alarm. Is everything okay in your home?

It was only a few steps from bedroom to hall but I was out of breath. I am not sure yet. Will you please stay on the line while I check the home?

Certainly sir.

Our home is on the smaller side but like all ranch-style homes it has a lot of windows. I reached for the bat I keep behind the closet door and slowly walked through each moon-lit room. I checked each window and door carefully for signs of forced exit or damage and each closet and hiding place. With each room my heart rate increased slightly, knowing that would be the room I found someone.

When I made a full circle of the home I let out a long breath and tried to regain my composure. I put the bat back in its place and informed the woman all was clear. She asked for the verbal clear code and I gave it to her and re-armed the system. I wiped the few beads of sweat off of my brow before heading into the bedroom.

My wife sat huddled in bed with eyes as big as Ive ever seen. Its okay, sweetheart. Just a false alarm. 

But, but why would it alarm at all? Are you sure you checked everywhere? Nothing is missing?

I crawled into bed and put my arms around her tightly and scratched her back. Yes everything is fine. Electronics are silly like that sometimes, you know? At least we know it works! I flashed my best grin and kept scratching until she drifted back into sleep.

-------------------

We both woke up a bit groggy from the midnight interruption but a large mug of coffee quickly remedied the slowness of step and glazed expressions. I tore the rubber band off of the paper and handed her all but the sports section. After a few poorly written stories about our awful teams and two pieces of peanut butter toast I got up and got ready for work.

Any news in the paper this morning, dear?

Nope, she replied with a grin.

See, nothing to be worried about. Lets get to work shall we?

I offered her my arm and walked down to the basement. We slipped on our lap coats and rubber galoshes and I keyed in the code. The large metal door swung in silently and I stepped through first. Just as I suspected one of our children had tried to escape again. I walked over to the cage our first born was in and inspected the damage. A few bent bars here and there but nothing I couldnt fix.

See? I asked my wife, I told you this was a good idea. *Why do we need to electrify the cages* you asked. *Why do we need a security system? What if they get suspicious?* She is a little hellion and needs to be taught a lesson. I directed my voice to our daughter and smacked her hard across the face. You try escaping again and a little zap will be the least of your worries.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I posted this today in NS but it was removed because it wasn't horror enough. What would you do to bring it to the next level? 

I've never posted a story for critique so this would be as good as any. Pick it apart, help me clean up my writing, whatever you can think of!

On to the story! 

---------


Somehow, deep down, I always knew Id kill myself. I never had much to live for. Grew up with no money and no friends, not particularly bright or hardworking enough for scholarships. My family are a bunch of loners and hatemongers, tearing at each other each Thanksgiving like carrion birds flocking to new death. 

I worked a real shit job on a real shit shift in a real shit part of town. Literally. I was an overnight sanitation worker at the sewage treatment plant. Armed with a hazmat suit and a forty foot paddle I pushed shit around all night long to keep the pumps from getting clogged. If one did I would get lowered down into a giant steaming vat of watery shit to manually unplug whatever horrible excrement-monster was gumming up the works.

When you get dunked into a vat of shit day after day you begin to only smell shit. Flowers smelled like shit, food smelled like shit. And of course I smelled like shit. That suit didnt do as much as you would think to protect me. No amount of showers could wash away the smell. You think I had a lot of friends or girls coming around? But dont feel sorry for me, I earned that life. Deserved it even. 

It was on one such shit-clogged night that I had to go diving into the swirling mess of my towns buttholes when my decision was made. My partner checked my suit, gave me the OK, and I was lowered down. I immediately knew something was wrong because the smell was much worse. Then I could feel it - the thick, stinky liquid began filling my suit. I tried to signal but the crane operator wasnt paying attention and by the time he did notice and lifted me out the foul brew was almost to my chin. 

I tried to keep my lips sealed tight but the herky-jerky movements of the cable sloshed shit all over my face. Some splashed into my nose and ears and some got past my lips. I gagged, vomited. More entered.

Everyone apologized; my co-workers, my supervisor, the nightshift plant manager. I was having none of it.

I got into my car, still covered in shit, and floored it out of the compound. With no traffic in sight I was free to let my 89 Ford Festiva open up full throttle. The car shook and convulsed once we hit 58 miles per hour but still I forced it further. The front bumper collided with the cement freeway pillar at 71 miles per hour and pushed inward until it met the trunk barrier. In movies the cars erupt on impact and a massive fireball ensues but that isnt real life. The car never caught fire, thank goodness for that. Can you imagine the smell of cooking shit?

You may be asking yourself How the hell does he know all of this? Apparently you cant commit suicide if you are already dead, drowned in 50,000 gallons of shit water. Somehow I made it out of my body before it ceased to exist without knowing, fueled by a hatred for the life I had led and tried to end it.

Watching your own funeral is quite sobering. It is hard to tell if anyone there is sincere or not but there were quite a few nice things said about me. It is no matter, I like the body I am in now. I am strong, tall, a bit more handsome that I used to be. I am married to a sweet, soft-spoken woman and have two children. One is even named after me. The job I have is fine albeit boring. Sit at a desk, answer calls, and tell a few people what to do. It can get maddening at times but at least I dont smell shit all day long.

The problem is I am getting a little bit bored. I never really wanted kids so they get on my nerves too easily. My wife keeps saying I have changed and has begun pestering me all the time. Oh, and her cooking, atrocious. I may give this suicide thing another try. Maybe I can bounce into another body that I like better this time. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Never fully dismiss your fears - Part 2 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-29 14:27:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Before](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/60uov0/never_fully_dismiss_your_fears/)

I am writing this from my mother-in-laws house, trying to recall everything I can over the past few days. Fear doesnt know age.

-------------------

When you watch a scary movie you are jumpy, nervous, on the edge the entire time because *you know* something is going to happen. It wouldnt be a scary movie if nothing did after all. Once the movie is over you slowly come down from the edge but you are wary, apprehensive. Strange sounds set your heart into overdrive and your imagination goes wild. When a lightbulb fizzles out or a door closes by itself that fear flares back up for a moment. That is how my family and I felt for the first few days back in our home.

Lights were left on all night in the hallway and kitchen, the vent fan in the bathroom turned on to mask the sounds of the night, and the bed was pulled away from the walls. When nothing happened that first night a wave of reassurance washed over us and we began to behave more normally again. The house was filled with the soft, tinkling laughter of our daughter and her silly antics removed any lingering fear or worry. 

It was good to be home. It is so easy to take for granted the things you have until they are taken from you. I found myself working harder at my job, more productive, so that I could get home sooner and spend time with my wife and daughter. I am pretty sure she knows the sound of my car now because when I open up the front door she is already moving toward it with an expectant grin. Those bright, blue eyes filled with the innocence and joy of a child lumbering toward me with each disjointed step. 

Every day she seems to learn something new. Just last week she has said four new words, signed two more, and began walking. But my favorite of all is hide and seek. Babies love peek-a-boo which is just a stationary version of hide and seek so it makes sense that they love the mobile game as well. She will crawl around behind her toy house and peek her head through the windows until I catch her gaze, then duck down and giggle. 

My wife and I bought her a nylon tent with tunnels that connect to each side for her birthday and set it up in her nursery this week. She loves it! We bought a little campfire set with the logs and fire and smores and hotdogs to roast and a little lantern to hang at the top. This is her new favorite place to play hide and seek. So many places to hide and crawl around, her own little maze. 

Every evening when I get home my girls give me a big hug and kiss, my daughters little arms grip around my neck and she says dada nonstop for the next half hour. I set my things down and crawl around after her while she hides and giggles and screams in delight. Ill pop my head through a tunnel and reach my arms around the other side to tickle her chubby thighs. Suddenly I am on the other side reaching through the front flaps. Then my huge body worms down another tunnel and I take all of the space up inside of the tent while she escapes down another tunnel toward freedom. Round and round we go until I am tired and dinner is ready. 

You would think with all of this play time she would get worn down by the end of the day and zonk out on her mommies belly after a good nursing but she is a ball of boundless energy. What used to be quiet time for my wife and I has been pushed from 7:30 to 8:30 and now this week past 9:00 PM. We still turned out all of the lights at 8:00 except for the reading lamp and let the night lights illuminate the rest of the home.

After dinner I was down on the floor reading her favorite books to her while she went back and forth between building a tower out of blocks and knocking it down. I finished the fourth or fifth book and clapped my hands as is custom at the end of a kids book and she took off for the nursey. I sighed and looked at my wife with a smile as my little girl waddled off for me to follow. On all fours, I growled my big scary daddy growl and slinked along the floor.

I smell a little baby, yes. I moved forward slowly, sniffing around the corner and peeked my head into the dimly lit room.

She sat at the edge of the tent with one hand on the flap looking over her shoulder to make sure I was following. Her eyes lit up and she lunged forward into the tent, knees sliding noisily along the nylon fabric. I waited until she stopped moving before proceeding to the tunnel she occupied, pushing my hand down to poke her in back. I was rewarded with a little squeal and the swish swish swish of her chubby legs motoring forward to the center of the tent. I gave my best lion roar and pocked my head through the flaps. She jumped backward and tugged on my hair before moving to another exit. 

I circled, growling softly, pushing my hands in this spot and that spot to see if she would grab back like she sometimes does. Tiny little razor sharp teeth clamped down on my finger and I pulled back quickly. 

Dang it! No biting, sweetie. She has been teething non-stop for over a month and chews on everything. It is a work in progress. I poked my head into the tent to pull her out but was met with her little feet churning away quickly to the end of a tunnel.

I wanted to get a hold of her quickly before the biting left her young mind so I leapt over the tent and reached into the tunnel she was in. I gently grabbed hold of her shoulders and her teeth immediately sank into my thumb. Only this time she didnt let go. I pulled her out to give her bottom a pat but was greeted with a furious swipe across my face. Razor sharp nails dug deeply into my skin and drew blood and tears. My vision was blurred but I could make out *something* resembling my daughter. The eyes were dark, dim, deeply set in anger and hatred. It was her sweet little face cast over with a horrible evil sneer. I gasped and out of the corner of my eye could see my daughter worm her way out of another tunnel, looking up at me with wide eyes. 

I tried to blink away the blood and tears but whatever this thing was squirmed out of my grip and sank its horrible teeth into my calf. I could feel the muscle separating inch by inch. Howling in pain I swiped out for it only to retreat back into the tunnel. My wife came running in as I was scooping up my daughter and limping forward to the door. Her eyes took in the damage to my face, the confused fear coated our daughter, and realization set in. She took our daughter and ran to the car.

Closing the door on her heels I turned slowly just in time to see the thing spring forward, nails glinting in the dim glow of the night light. I barely had time to raise an arm up before it crashed into me with surprising force and I staggered down to one knee. My leg throbbed all the way up to my knee, hot searing cuts opened on my arm where I had taken its charge. Blood continued to trickle into my eyes blurring my vision and I flung my arm out in a wide arc to try and slam into my tormentor. 

I felt the back of my hand connect with its leg and saw it fling sideways off balance. I lunged forward and landed directly on top of it. Bones cracked and a high-pitched screech sent cracks across the mirror and windows. I clutched at my ears but gasped when a talon started to burrow into my chest. Reaching under me and rolling sideways I held it at arms length and battered it into the solid wood drawing table. Another series of cracks, probably ribs this time. Between rapid blinks I could see pure hatred mixed with pain in the mimics face. 

Adrenaline coursed through me and powered my arms into action. I bent and twisted and squeezed and tore at the horror in front of me. Blind rage overtook me. Invading my home, tormenting my family, scaring my child. My hands did not leave much left when I was done. With my one good eye I watched the life slip from the terrible thing and once it did I broke down. My body wracked with sobs and somewhere deep inside I knew I would never be the same.

Then a slow, maniacal chuckle echoed through the house.

Fears never go away, they just get suppressed. And they get stronger.

It can be anything I want it to be. Im at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, exploring deep and mysterious trenches. Im in the depths of space, further away than the Hubble can find. Whole galaxies wink out of existence before my eyes. 

Eyes. The other things I see. Many sets of them just out of reach, always staring at me. How do they see me? They follow my movements.

I can hear their voices now. Before all was silent but I can hear them now, bits and pieces. Discussing me. 

Sensory stimulation isolation. Strengthening others by removing. Questions?

Darkness. It can be anything I want it to be. I am exploring a virgin cave.

<TEXT> [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/612wbn/healthlink/)

So after the incident with Stephanie I have tried to keep my head down and focus on staying busy to not attract attention to myself. I knew something was wrong but I had no idea what just yet. The best way to find out anything is to gather information so I took on as many work orders as I could around the hospital in hopes of overhearing conversations or witnessing any more strange behavior with the staff.

Over the course of the next few days I didnt see anything strange or off-putting, just more of the same. The staff, nurses and doctors especially, were overly active towards their patients. Instead of ignoring the first alarm or sighing and trudging into rooms they practically bounced out of their chairs or broke conversation mid-sentence to go check on an issue. Is this a bad thing? No, of course not. But it is *different*. Such a drastic change in a short period of time sent off alarm bells in my head. 

Once I had determined that their eager-beaver attitude was key to this whole thing pieces started to fall into place. Maybe I wasnt paying attention to the right conversations before or maybe it took a little time for the wheels to start falling off but by the end of my weekend shift I felt like I knew what was going on.

The first conversations to strike me were about staff sickness and sudden turnover. If you have ever worked in a hospital you know that people get sick all the time and not everyone is cut out to work in such a high stress environment. People fizzle out and quit within days, sometimes not even making it through a full shift. Because of these reasons I didnt immediately take notice of all the talk but it seemed to be everywhere, every department, and not just new hires leaving. A lot of grizzled veterans were just leaving without even calling in or giving notice. The hospital is the top paying in the state so it wasnt hard to find new bodies to fill the positions but with so many new faces running around there was a lot of training to do.

The other conversations were regarding new hire orientation. I didnt get to hear much about this but basically none of the new hires can remember it other than they went to it. They came in and got their badges and met the CEO and their department heads, discussed the hospital values and goals and that is all they can recall. Eight hours of orientation and they can only remember two hours worth the material. I can still remember my orientation and it was eighteen years ago! 

I knew that I had to get to the bottom of this and the bump on Stephanies neck kept flashing across my minds eye so I set out to figure out what it was.

Every opportunity I had I checked peoples necks. I am probably labeled as the weirdo now after following behind closely or giving a fake neck massage to random people. Hey you look tense but I was correct in my assumption. Everyone has that same square lump at the top of their neck, old and new employees alike. I felt my neck, used a mirror to check it, no lump. Was it an oversight? Did I get missed because I was sent to training? I asked around to see if anyone else went to an off-site training and only a few had, but they all had the lump.

I tried to replay the training in my mind. The first day we were given a tour, shown the expansive product line, how they all tied in together. The next few days we worked on some hardware, taking it apart, checking for common issues, that kind of thing. On the last day we had a wrap up, Q and A session and then a long lunch break. Oh! Thats it! I headed down to the center of town to check out a steak place the other guys said was amazing and got stuck down there. Some kind of parade. My car was blocked in for two hours so I never made it back for the last half of the day. That is when they must have put the lump in. So what does it do? What is it for?

I am surprised they didnt realize I was absent. It may only be a matter of time before they know. Maybe they already do.

The rest of the day was less about doing work and more about trying to be around scenarios similar to what I witnessed in the ED. I balanced most of my time between ICU and ED looking for reasons to be there. One older gentleman in ICU was brought in after suffering a stroke at home and was in a bad state. By the time the nurse checked him in and talked with his family for a few minutes he started to look a lot better, his vitals becoming steadier. At the same time I could see the exhaustion and pain slowly creep into the nurses face. Suddenly a seizure ripped through his body and staff went rushing in to help. 

As his vitals spiked and crashed all over the monitors the nurse crashed with him. She lay there on the cold tile floor as others rushed around her to stabilize the man. I ran in and tried to get their attention but no one seemed to hear me. Fearing they would step all over her I scooped her up and brought her out to the nurses station where another nurse did some manual readings like pulse and blood pressure. Her body went into another series of spasms and just as the flat line from the room sounded through the department the nurse in my arms stopped living. 

Each time they tried to resuscitate the man the nurse reacted similarly, as if the paddles were on her chest on not his. Several moments later both were dead. I have seen patients wheeled out on the red gurney, covered in a soft red velvet sheet but never a staff member.

As you can imagine I was freaking out! I followed her and the security guards down trying to get some answers. What the hell happened to her? Why was no one trying to help? Then I realized we were not going to the morgue in the basement but a sub-basement where all of our boilers and other huge, loud machinery is kept. I yelled and cursed at them for answers but they acted like I didnt exist. 

Her body was wheeled deeper and deeper through the maze of pipes and vents until we hit the back wall where a massive furnace was located. What the. NO!

I slammed my body into one of the guards and knocked him down, trying to wrestle the gurney away from the other. I made it a few steps before one was on my back and took me to the ground. I watched helplessly as her body was pushed forward into an orange dancing wall and turned my face, hot tears flowing down my face. 

They left me there, again as though I didnt even exist, and entered the elevator as though they didnt just burn a body. I dont know how long I lay there crying but eventually I stumbled outside and took off in my car until my gas tank dipped dangerously below empty and pulled into a motel. I am writing this now in the hopes that I can warn enough of you to make a difference. Once I submit this Ill be calling the police, FBI, CIA, whatever I can to try and get these psychos shut down. 

I think that lump was a control chip that connected the staff to the patient. I think the staff give their health in order to cure the patients. I think if they fail they die. If you see HealthLink logos at your hospital dont check in. Turn around and alert the police, the media, whoever you can.

<TEXT> Excellent post and excellent points. I wish I was a better writer to be able to write longer stories. I feel like I either get too bogged down with details and lose the audience or I don't have enough substance and lose the audience. 

Because of this I've fallen into a short, catchy series of posts instead of working harder to get the story to flow properly in order to keep readers for a single, longer one. 

I WANT to try for more single stories in the future.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Beep.

Beep.

Beep.

Beep.

Eventually you no longer hear it even though it is there. Alarm fatigue. 

Beep.



Beep.





Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep.

They hear that one. Nurses rush around, doctors bark orders, but nothing can be done. Time of death is 10:58AM.

-----------------

I work in a hospital in a large city. There are almost one thousand beds in this gleaming white palace which means almost one thousand beeps every minute. With so many patients and so few staff alarm fatigue is considerable here. There isnt much you can do about it, even I have it.

That is why when another patient was not cared for properly and resulted in a possibly avoidable death the big brass at the top brought in a consulting firm. They assessed our staff individually and collectively, our equipment and core systems, our IT infrastructure, even the patient flow from common departments like the Emergency Room, Surgery, ICU, and Recovery. 

The reason I know about this at all is because I was part of the team to install all of the new equipment we bought from the firm. It was called HealthLink and it was an all-in-one system that connected every single piece of equipment from the handheld thermometer to the largest MRI room. Every piece of pertinent information about every patient could be transferred and viewed regardless of where they went in the hospital. Even the new wheelchairs recording their vitals as they were pushed from one room to the next. It also didnt use beeps or obnoxious flashing lights to indicate issues because those could be silenced, ignored, or disturb the patient. Instead, each patient was assigned to staff via their employee badge and a connected earpiece relayed information.

I have to admit it was impressive. The cost for something like this would be unimaginable but I suppose bad press would damage the hospitals image enough to warrant such a drastic change. We sold all of our old equipment off to other hospitals and clinics via a large auction once HealthLink was up and running and I was sent off for three weeks of extensive on-site training.

---------------

When I came back from training I was amazed at the transformation with the staff. Nurses sprang to life as soon as their badge alerted them. Doctors buzzed happily from patient to patient to check in on them. Physical therapists led yoga classes in the atrium. Even the custodial staff grinned from ear to ear as they turned down rooms to make ready for a new patient or hauled the trash out to the compactor. 

Now dont get me wrong, I am not saying that our staff were a bunch of angry monsters that hated their jobs, but everyone can get burned out from time to time. A verbally abusive patient or pushy family members can bring you down pretty quickly if you are caught off guard. 

Seeing everyone in such a good mood helped keep me up high as well and I breezed through my day for several weeks. I bounced from repair to repair whistling away when I realized I hadnt heard an overhead page for a stroke or stemi or code blue all day. In such a big hospital you get at least one stroke and several code blues. Come to think of it I couldnt remember hearing a single page since the training. *Maybe they dont need them anymore with the new system*, I thought. I decided I would try to pay more attention, maybe I had just missed them or tuned them out.

The next day I was down in the Emergency Department checking the calibration of one of the new monitors when several ambulances pulled up, ushering ten people in on gurneys. There was a massive multi-car pileup on the highway and several others were being life-flighted in. Our ED was already pretty full and I could see the stress break through a few of the staffs faces as they tried to get the new patients into rooms and their basic needs met. 

I flagged down one of the nurses and let her know the room I was working on would be ready soon and they would be able to put one of the patients in now while I finished up. 

Ill stay for a bit to make sure it all works with the new patient, just in case.

Thank you so much. Youre a life saver! With that she sped off to bring one of the worst-off in. 

Being in the middle of it all gave me a certain perspective that I probably would have missed otherwise. The busier nurses looked to be in pain. Tightened eyes and grimaces now appeared on their once smiling, cheerful faces. The nurse wheeled in the transfer gurney and the paramedics helped move the patient onto the trauma stretcher. She scanned the patients wristband and then her own badge to link them to each other and she immediately groaned out in pain. 

She asked the patient questions in a rapid fire succession to assess the pain level and immediate needs, verified name, date of birth, and then rushed off to get some pain medicine and an air compressor for the patients legs. 

By this time the ED was filled with moans and groans from all the new patients and staff alike. Nurses rushed from room to room trying to fill each of their needs as quickly as possible. I noticed that those with the fewest rooms didnt look pained anymore but the lead nurse covering the room I was in, Stephanie, was slowly becoming overwhelmed with requests. By the time she made it back to our room with what she needed her face mirrored that of the patient. I couldnt tell who was in more pain!

Stephanie, whats wrong? Are you alright? Stephanie. Hey, can you hear me?

Panic set in when she turned up to me slightly in response before crashing down to the floor. Pills scattered across the gleaming linoleum. I crossed the room in two strides and bent down to help her when I noticed the square bump high on the back of her neck in between now-parted braids. 

HELP!! 

Her breathing was increasingly shallow and sporadic and her skin was paling quickly. Just as two other nurses came over I realized that the patient had stopped groaning so I turned to look at the vitals  they had stabilized.

<TEXT> Halloween was always my favorite day each year. You get to dress up in fun costumes, eat candy and homemade treats, play hide and seek into the wee hours of the morning. 

This year was no exception! I went out with all of my friends and went door to door gathering our treats. Within an hour I could barely hold my bag up off of the ground it was so full. What a great night! 

My friends and I ran with our bags of treats to the woods were we always play hide and seek. I carefully navigated the three miles to my usual spot. It was very hard to find so I usually won 

Out of breath but full of excitement I emptied my bag out onto the soft forest floor and five little boys tumbled out, whimpering with fear.

A huge smile plastered across my face. *I am going to count to 100 and then I am going to come find you. If you last more than two hours you get to live!*

Plopping down amid the leaves with my eyes closed, I began to count </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Kristy, I am glad that it worked out for you! I moved to Kansas in the name of love and found another love in my bed. It was the poops. BUT I did end up staying and met my wife so all is good. 

Custody is a hard thing. I am sorry to hear about that :(

Ever live in southern California or Kansas?

Whenever I see Poppymoonray my inner voice says "poopymoonray", can't help it, can't stop it. 

Glad my post was so well received. It is a lot of fun learning more about the mods and veterans of this sub. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Never fully dismiss your fears </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-22 14:46:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I used to have a habit of sleeping with an arm or a leg hanging off of the side of the bed. For whatever reason it was comfortable to me. Then I watched Childs Play. The little psycho doll hiding under beds and slashing peoples tendons. I was probably eight or nine when I first watched it and my habit came to an abrupt end.

For years I was fearful of something hiding under my bed poised to attack the moment I swung my legs over the edge or dangled a hand down. So I began jumping out of bed. I was not afraid to be in bed and go to sleep and I was not afraid to grab my toys out from under the bed or even play under the bed IF I was already on the floor. The unknown, the hidden, out of my sight lines - that is what scared me. 

As do most childhood fears like being afraid of the dark or the deep end of the pool I grew out of my need to jump off the bed and my habit of arm or leg dangling off the side of the bed slowly took hold once again. I dont know whether it is the fact that as we age we become more rational or become bigger and stronger and more capable. Every so often the movie would pop up on TV late at night, usually around October and November, and I think about my silly fear and chuckle. But without fail that very first morning I would hesitate slightly before getting out of bed. Just for a brief flicker that fear would rush to the front of my mind and I would need to push it back. 

The last time that happened was probably a decade and a half ago, maybe even longer, because I cant remember the last time I hesitated. Until this morning. 

I am 31 now, married and have a child of my own. I would like to say that I run my household but I dont. My little girl does. Every drawer has a special lock on it. Every corner has rubber coatings. Baby gates dominate the landscape. And my king sized bed lies unceremoniously on the floor. No box frame, no box springs, just a low profile mattress covered in pillows and sheets. Why, you might ask? So that our sweet little girl wont fall off. 

Now you may be asking yourself why any of this matters to the story at hand. Remember how as I child I would be afraid of things under my bed? This morning I awoke with a start. Heart racing, feet and palms sweating, and blood dripping from my outstretched arm. Thin, deep cuts ran the length of my forearm. The cuts began at the point where my arm extended off of the edge of the bed. 

It is hard to be afraid of something under your bed when it is lying flat on the floor with your body weight pressing it down but at that moment I was terrified. My eyes flicked around the dim room trying to see the culprit. When nothing jumped out at me as obvious and all hiding places appeared empty I slowly made my way out of bed, trying not to let any more of my blood further saturate the sheets and attended to my wounds in the bathroom.

After a lot of gauze and athletic tape my arm was bandaged up so I began searching around the house for anything out of place, missing, uncharacteristic. After finding nothing I tried to calm my nerves and settle down. I tried the logic approach - The alarm was still on, nothing set it off, what did this to my arm?

I went in to wake up my wife and explain to her what happened when I saw a glint of metal coming from the grate next to our bed. Sprinting the last few steps I pushed the bedside table out of the way and ripped the vent right off of the wall. A few drops of blood on the back of the vent cover were all I could find but I swear I saw something inside of there! 

My wife woke up startled from all of the noise and saw my bandaged arm and torn up wall. Her first words were along the lines of what the hell are you doing? but she was cut off when a low, soft chuckle made its way out of the vent and into our ears.

---------------

UPDATE:

First I want to thank you all for the amazing suggestions given in the comments. I never would have thought of most of them to try. Honestly I was too afraid to do much thinking at all other than to get out. 

I wasnt able to get any chlorine gas but I did hook up my car via a very long hose. I went through the house and closed every vent except for one and dropped the hose down into it. Once the car was running I ran around the house pouring salt around each vent to try to further force whatever this thing is to stay inside and suffer the fumes. 

Once that was done I set our motion sensors on the highest setting and armed the house. They should pick up any movement the size of a bunny or larger. I opened up the app to my security system and watched for any motion notifications while I circled the house, making sure nothing escaped from a vent or window or hole in the ground. Who knows, right? 

I ran my car for a full gas tank worth just to be sure and then let the house air out while I walked to the closest gas station with my spare tank. I watched my security notifications all day, all night, and all through the next day as well without a single alarm. I figured the house was probably cleared out by then and safe for me to walk around in. There was still a funny smell in the air but I opened up all of the vents and turned the attic fan on and opened up all of the windows. None of the salt was disturbed so I know it didnt make it out of a vent. 

Thank you so much for the great ideas, guys! We are going to wait one more day to really clear out the air and then move back in. My wife is looking forward to sleeping in our bed once again and so am I.

What part of trying to be a friend are you missing? I never intimidated him and I continually told him we were fine. No hard feelings.

<TEXT> Interest is calculated off of the remainder of the loan, not the original amount. Therefore putting additional principal down early pays off the part of the loan that the interest is calculated from.

If you make the minimum payments the "expected loan amount" that they calculate in the beginning would be correct. **BUT** if you pay extra it will go down. 

For example you have a $100 loan at 10% interest. If you pay $20 dollars it would drop to $80 plus interest which is $10 so now the loan balance is $90.

But if you then paid an additional $20 of principal it would drop to $70 without interest being added on.

Then your next payment rolls around and you pay your $20 which drops the loan to $50 plus the $7 that the interest tacks on equaling $57.

If you did not make that additional payment your loan would be at $79 ($90-20=70 ... + the $9 from interest) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Would you like to play a game with me? The rules are simple.

1.	The object of the game is to take control of the game board with your pieces

2.	Move your pieces to take strategic positions on the board *or* block the opponent from getting to a position on the board

3.	Each piece has a defined, concrete type of movement

      a.	Inhibitors can move two spaces in any direction

      b.	Activators can move one space forward or two spaces back

      c.	Links can be placed on the board to connect an Activator to a space permanently

4.	Two Activators can remove an Inhibitor and visa-versa

5.	The player to control more than half of the board after all turns in a round wins


You would? Great! I knew youd like my game. It is very addicting! Just put this headset on and we can begin.

Oh, poor first move. Hey, did I mention what you win? No, silly me, I always forget that part. You win complete control of your opponents mind. Isnt that great?

<TEXT> Good morning, NSers!

Yesterday my eyes were opened to a beautiful truth about this subreddit. The horrible shame boners we all get from reading these amazing stories has actually blossomed into real, unrequited love. There are people freaking getting married! Some of them met on here! And there are Canadians among us... just teasing. Kind of.

So that got me to thinking - what the hell else do I not know about the amazing community that I write to and read from. 

Then I thought so more. Now we are getting into dangerous territory! If I have this many questions maybe some have questions about me. So here we go:

My name is Aaron and I live in Kansas City, Kansas. I am married (six years) and our only daughter just turned one two weeks ago. I have always loved reading, usually gobbling up a book in a day because I didn't want to put it down. 

Parenting took a huge chunk of time away from that so my main form of reading now comes from this sub during my working hours. I have also always enjoyed writing. Poems, silly bed time stories for my friends kids, that kind of thing. 

This sub has inspired me to try and put all of those horrible English classes to good use and get my thoughts on paper. Of course my family is a huge inspiration as well.

All of my stories are based on my life to some degree. The Craigslist story actually happened (except the kidnapping part), the Patient 314 series is based off of a condition I have, over-active heart. 

I hope this was helpful and fun for you to know a little about me. And I hope this was in the right place. If you have any questions you would like to ask me, go for it! I would love to learn more about you, too, so please comment about who you are and how you started writing.

Thanks for being so awesome, NS! </TEXT>

<TEXT> My great grandfather and I were very close. He had a woodshop out back that he would hole up in and tinker with one project or another while smoking his pipe. I would sit quietly and watch him work. I have a few of his pieces of furniture throughout my home as does my parents, grandparents, and pretty much every aunt and uncle. He was incredible with wood. I speak in the past tense about grandad because he died recently of old age. It was peaceful, from what I am told. Heart attack in his sleep that never woke him up. 

Everyone was grieving, sorrowful, wishing for one last moment, but no one shocked. He was quite old and lived a long life after all. And of course he smoked quite a bit for his entire adult life. At the funeral there were many great stories told about him. He loved to spin some yarn and had a laundry list of amazingly fantastic tales that he would captivate us younguns with. Some of the most popular ones were retold, attempting to re-enact the magic that grandad created, some were of his youthful shenanigans, some of how wonderful of a father he was. 

All were true, all were powerful. But it was the story that no one told, my favorite story of his, that stuck out to me and that story is the one I would like to entrust with you today. After the funeral I talked with many friends and family I had not seen in years, maybe even decades for some, and asked if any had talked with grandad about *The Camp*. Most had no idea what I was talking about but his eldest daughter, my grandmother had a very different response. She hit me upside my head and scolded me as you would a dog who just peed on new carpet. 

Dont you ever ask about that again, Charles. Dont you ever!

With that she stormed out and I received quite a few looks and head shakes. Murmurs spread through the crowded living room. *What did he say? Insensitive little shit, isnt he? Such a shame to ruin today.*

I followed her outside to try and figure out what I had done to upset her so badly and found her shuddering with sobs on the front steps of the porch. I apologized, explained that I was confused about her reaction and why no one knew about the story. After a time she caved and told me it was not a story as I had supposed but was in fact true. She couldnt believe that he had told it to me but supposed it was because we had such a special bond. We talked for over an hour - me asking questions, her filling in gaps in my memory and gaps in the details grandad left out.

I left in complete awe, and quite frankly afraid. I will do my best to tell his story.

--------------------

Granddad had been helping Jews hide for almost a year when he was caught. I think they treated sympathizers worse than they treated the Jews, if that were possible. He and those he was hiding were ushered into the back of a truck and taken to a train. From there they were segregated by sex and age and health.

He was still young and strong so he was sent to Monowitz, or Auschwitz III, to work in the chemical factories along with the other political prisoners and Jewish slaves. From what information I can find on the work camp a slave would last on average four months but that is generous according to granddad. He said you try to make friends to endure another day but by the time you know someones name they are already dead.

He never did go into much detail about the camp and his work there but he did tell me he was there almost seven months. An accident in the plant left him with a bad leg that he couldnt hide from the SS officers and he knew he would be dead within the week if not that very day. Once you were too weak to work they would ship you off to Birkenau to be gassed.

At that time the Germans had yet to perfect their methods of killing. They were experimenting with carbon monoxide, Zyklon A, B and C, and innumerable different ways to deliver them. In the middle of the night my granddad and forty or more near-death Jews were ushered into the back of a large van with whips. The van was sealed and left running with the exhaust redirected into the sealed compartment. Granddads van was also equipped with Zyklon C and the combination of exhaust fumes and Zyklon C filled their mobile prison cell very quickly. 

Some of this may sound familiar to you but that is where the similarities end. Zyklon C isnt mentioned anywhere in the history books. I have no idea what it was but I do know that it was only used once. 

Granddad and the other men pounded on the sides of the van, screaming for help, to be let out, for mercy. People scrambled on top of others in an attempt to find non-toxic air. Noses were broken, eyes pushed in, teeth kicked loose. Granddad huddled in the corner praying it would be over quickly. His eyes watered and his lungs burned and his skin felt like he had stepped into an oven. 

He had to pull away from the corner because of the heat. Patches of his exposed skin burned from touching the walls of the van. Others began yelling out in pain and pushed toward the center. The walls began to glow a dull red, then brighter, brighter, orange turned into bright yellow. There was no more air to breath. The extreme heat had sucked it all out and men clutched at their throats, clawing at their eyes as the heat seared their retinas and traveled inward to their brain. 

Some succumbed quickly and others laid on top of their bodies as protection from the superheated floor of the van. Granddad said he thought the entire van had been driven into a crematorium and set ablaze. He gave in to the heat and lack of oxygen soon after climbing above a fallen neighbor. 

He awoke with a start, like being hit with a defibrillator. The intense heat was still present and it made his skin crawl as if it were melting right off of his bones. Each breath scorched his insides and no amount of tears could moisten his eyes. Every centimeter of his body burned and ached. A vast chasm expanded out in front of him and millions of people stood along the edge. One by one they toppled forward. Their screams echoed up indefinitely as granddad watched the horror. After what seemed like hours he felt his body move against his will. One step forward. Then another. With a final step he would be lost in the chasm forever when he was pulled backwards.

Backwards out of a burning van. Bodies were dragged out and thrown into a ditch nearby. Only he survived. He was later told that the engine backfired which caused the fire. Those who didnt die from the gas were boiled alive by the extreme heat.

Granddad was shipped from Birkenau to a large manor in the countryside where officers and doctors questioned him. How did you survive? What happened to you? How long were you in the van? He was hooked up to all kinds of tests, interrogated and tortured for weeks, and finally shipped off to a work camp in case further questioning was needed. 

At first he couldnt believe he was alive. He reveled in it, worked hard, kept his head down. Just as his curiosity began to get the best of him the war was over and he was found and set free. He begged the United States military to take him to the manor for answers and finally they did.

Granddad has survived in the back of that van for over two days while it raged and burned with a heat so intense it melted the frame in some places. They never used Zyklon C again after that but they did continue the use of the vans with just the exhaust directed into the back via a grate on the floor. Rumor spread about the fire and they were given the nickname Hell Vans. 

It is amazing how close to the truth that name was.

<TEXT> He was not a good person. Not a good husband or father, not a good neighbor or teacher. English class, I believe.

He was, however, an excellent task master. What good are children if not for labor? He had many.

His house was sparkling and spotless. Martha Stewart would be proud. The lawn immaculate, rivaling the cities botanical gardens. Had you been unfortunate enough to be his neighbor you would see his children work their fingers to the bone day in and day out. 
They could not play. They could not frolic. They could not eat until the chores were done. 

I never heard them talk, let alone laugh. But I heard him.

Bite the bullet, girl. You dilly dally now youll miss supper.

Dont you dare cut corners, boy. A man is only as good as the job he does.

Looks like you finished by the skin of your teeth today!

What are you waiting for? The early bird gets the worm!

My wife told me not to interfere. She told me to let the police handle things. I couldnt do that.

------------

I strapped him tightly to a sturdy chair in my basement and slapped his face to wake him up. I forced the mouth widener into his thin-lipped maw. No pain, no gain. My eyes must have twinkled when I uttered those four words because fear dripped out of his in the form of tears. 

Using a scalpel I slowly peeled the gums away from his teeth one by one. 

I am not sure what exactly constitutes a corner on a human being so I did my best. His shoulders gushed from the deep gashes and his feet pumped blood out of the stumps where toes used to be. 

As the color in his skin slowly faded I placed a bullet in between his red teeth. Time to call it a day, neighbor. I placed a punch on the back of the bullet casing and mashed into it with a hammer. 

I hated English. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I knew a Carlos. He would give me purple nurples and Indian burns all the time. He stole my gym clothes and art supplies so I couldn't take part in every project. 

The teachers never listened to me and eventually I had to do something about it. Right in the middle of class I punched him in the face as hard as I could. I doubt it really hurt him too badly but it stopped all of the hassling.

Years later I finally grew up, standing over 6 ft. 2 and bulked up a little. He didn't. I towered over him and he literally acted like my slave out of fear of what I might do in retaliation for the years of torment. 

Stand up for yourself, OP. Don't let him take over your life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you have a really great story that can be "updated" in the course of a night or two I suggest posting the main part and then updating the readers "as it happens". 

If your story can't really be broken down like that but has a natural break, maybe a cliffhanger somewhere in the middle, go a head and make it a two part series.

Otherwise just slap it all in one post and let the readers enjoy all of it at once. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **This was mysteriously deleted, probably from the makers of the Pool I entered. I am submitting it here again with an update from day one of the tournament.**

Tomorrow the NCAA Tournament begins (yes, the play-in games were Tuesday, no I dont count them) and like most if not all of you I love this time of year. I am in countless pools at work, with college buddies, family, and all the major sports websites that offer prizes for free. It is fun, exciting, and usually pretty free money. Online betting sites offer all kinds of free bets during this time to suck people in and get them to deposit more of their own. I never fall for that and usually dont need to anyway. Ive already cashed out a few checks all from a free $5 bet that one site gave me.

I dont mean to brag but usually I do very well in the pools and make a few hundred on them each year. This year will hopefully be no different. I had all of my brackets set and a few free bets ready to go and was just about to shut down the computer when a pop-up caught my eye. I usually dont get pop-ups which is why I paid attention to it in the first place.

MARCH MADNESS 2017  Feed the Frenzy!!!

That was all it said and below it was a link. The color of the font seemed off to me, a shade of red too dark and less playful than most. It almost seemed ominous now that I look back on it. Upon clicking the link it took me to a very nice, simple bracket layout. It was probably the nicest and easiest to use out of all of the sites I had been to this morning. Oddly enough it didnt prompt me to log in or sign up but simply make my picks.

After the East and Midwest regions were filled out I scrolled down to the lower half of the bracket and that is when I saw a few lines of text concerning the prizes. Basically, each pick that you are correct on will give you a random prize. Each round increases the value of the prize and if you pick the winner of the Tournament the grand prize is beyond your wildest dreams. The prizes are generated once you submit your picks.

Great, I thought. I went back and reviewed the first two regions to make sure I was good with the picks I had made. If each correct pick wins something I wanted to give it my best shot, you know? A few minutes later the bracket was complete and I hit the SUBMIT button which was the same font as the ad. Next to each game two additional slots opened up and a prize popped in to each one. I watched as watches and cell phones and gift cards filled the bracket up. I dont know if it was just coincidence or if the prizes are based off of your search engine results or whatever but all of the prizes were things that I either needed or wanted.

When the grand prize popped up I couldnt believe it. It was a house that my wife and I were lusting after! We are in the process of getting our current home ready to sell to take advantage of the increasing housing prices and all of the renovations we have done and of course we have been looking at homes to purchase once ours is sold. There was one that was perfect for us and our growing family but it was quite a bit out of our budget. And there it was, sitting in the middle of my bracket. I was just staring at it for a while before I realized that another picture was filling in beneath the prizes. I didnt understand at first. Was this like a consolation prize or something? After about fifteen or so filled in my eyes grew wide and my heart began to stampede around in my chest. These were my things! Our things! Home decorations, personal items, my car popped up in the final four. I almost passed out when the last picture popped up. It was a picture of my wife and I at our wedding, smiling from ear to ear.

A new pop-up appeared in the center of my monitor.

Thank you for your entry in the March Madness 2017  Feed the Frenzy bracket pool. You are one of thousands trying to win it all and change your life! For each game you win you will receive a prize personalized to your needs from one of the other contestants that lost the game. If no one loses we will provide the gift personally. For each game you lose an item will be taken from you and given to a lucky winner! Enjoy the Madness!

I didnt give any information. How did they know what I wanted? How did they know what I have?! I am trembling right now. How am I going to explain this to my wife? Someone was in my house! Taking pictures of all of our stuff. I what have I done?

-----------------

After I had posted this I started looking into my internet history, cookies, cache, anything that I could use to try and locate where the pop-up had originated from. There was no sign of it anywhere on my computer. Granted I am not the most knowledgeable IT guy around but I know enough to get me into trouble.

Once my quick search was fruitless I called the police and informed them of the invasion into my home, taking pictures of my more valuable items and stealing information. The operator that answered told me that she had received several calls similar to mine and that the station was looking into it. I still haven't heard anything from them about it.

After I had hung up I called a good friend of mine in the IT department at my work and he said he would look into it for me as well. A quick Google search for the key words from the pop-up did not find any results and I couldn't find anyone complaining about it online so that was a dead-end at least right now. I am dreading the games tomorrow...

------------

**Update after Day One**

I am so screwed up right now. After I drank enough to build up the courage to explain what was going on to my wife she raged on me hard and stormed out. Said she was staying with a friend for a while until I could figure out my addictions. 

I hardly call betting on a few games once a year an addiction but that is beside the point. This is probably for the best anyway. I wouldn't want her to get hurt or anything so she is probably safer being with a friend instead of at home. Hell, I should be with a friend, too!

I have never been so nervous to see the outcomes of the games in my entire life. Normally it is a fun, exciting time for me but not this year. I sweat through four applications of deodorant today at work. I jumped at every cheer. I don't know if my heart can take this for three weeks! 

Usually clocking out at work is a joyous occasion. Not today. I drove under the speed limit, held back at every yellow light. I was dreading whatever may have happened at my home while I was gone.

Finally I made it to my front door. It was closed, locked, the alarm was active. 

I set my keys down and tried to slow the thumping in my chest as  I walked to the kitchen to grab a beer. As I twisted off the cap I looked to my left into the dining room and there, on the table, were fourteen brown boxes. Within each one my prize. When I had cleared out all of the trash and packing peanuts I found an index card with two items listed on it and a "Thank you" hand written at the bottom. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Time is a powerful thing. It dictates how we value activities and what we warrant good enough. You can waste time or be efficient with your time however you can never get time back. It is ever-flowing and only on one direction.


The pleasantly voiced woman turns her body forty five degrees and gestures with her outstretched arm to the gentleman behind her. 


With that being said what would you do if you had no perception of time? Would you live your life any differently? Would you waste time on video games or books or social media? Would you focus on one hobby and perfect it? Would you simply go crazy?


She cocks her head slightly and smiles to the group.


That is what we aim to find out. So far Ian has been living within this confined apartment-style cell for twelve years and four months. We supply everything he needs and asks for barring items such as a clock or calendar. Some of you might have noticed the clock hanging on the wall. Does it look somewhat strange to you?


A hand goes up slowly, nervously.


Yes, what do you notice about the clock?


The young boy timidly responds. It only has a second hand.


Correct! Ian is not the first volunteer for this project. Steve did not last very long, unfortunately. Six weeks if I remember correctly. He made an innumerable amount of comments during his time in the cell about needing to know. Before we placed Ian into his new home we installed a clock with only the second hand in an attempt to understand just how much information we need about time in order to function. Does anyone else notice something different about the clock?


Its too fast, blurted out another child. 


Well done! Yes, we have sped up the second-hand twice now, each an increment of one eighth of a second. It was believed that if done in small enough increments that Ian would not notice and therefore use his time that much more effectively. So far the hypothesis has been correct.

A brief pause, then, Any questions? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The news was on in the break room. The TV is usually never on, and especially not news. It is boring, drab, and depressing, and our office doesn't need any more of that. 

Normally I would have turned it off but the main headline caught my eye. A small child almost died of a peanut butter allergy at school and the parents are being questioned as suspects.

*Why suspects?* I thought. 

My interest was piqued and I turned it up hoping for more details. I was shocked as more information slowly escaped the red lips of the newscaster.

The day prior the parents took out a huge life insurance policy on their child and it looked as though they were attempting to collect on that. What is strange is that they had seven years to do such a thing but only now had the child ever had an accident with peanuts. 

My mind began turning. Was it coincidence that my sandwich was made with a soft white bread and bologna? I began to think not. 

Hours later and hundreds of web pages later an idea formed solidly in my mind. My pb j's have been finding their way into people's lunches with nut allergies. Sometimes it killed them, sometimes simply hospitalized with a full recovery. However, in each instance there has been foul play uncovered. 

My sandwiches were super heroes!   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Trouble Sleeping </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-15 16:27:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My daughter just turned one and she is finally starting to sleep in her own room. It has been an awful struggle to get her to sleep through the night and pure exhaustion forced us into letting her sleep in our room for quite some time. I am sure many of you parents reading this can relate. About three weeks ago she started to get less clingy at night and would let us put her down in her crib. We would probably get five or six hours of solid sleep before she would wake up and need us to walk her around for a while before settling back in for the rest of the night.

It was fantastic! I couldnt remember the last time my wife and I just laid in bed and cuddled without worrying about moving too much or making a noise that woke our daughter up. The bags under my eyes started to reverse course and we were both in a much more chipper mood. 

Sunday night our daughter woke up every hour screaming. At first we thought maybe another tooth was coming in so we would sooth her and put her back down. Monday night the same thing happened. She didnt have a fever or a runny nose so it probably wasnt a tooth. Was she regressing? No way, not happening. I want my bed back. 

We resigned to take turns, one night my wife and the next would be mine. That leads me to tonight  it was my turn. I had some work to catch up on so I was up late already. My eyes were getting blurry and stinging from being open so long and staring at a dim laptop screen when I heard the first wails. Ugh. I was halfway down the hallway before I remembered that I was already holding my daughter. Chills went up and down my spine.

What was crying in my daughters room? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember waking up knowing something was off. I usually dont move in my sleep but that morning I was twisted and wrapped horribly in my sheets as though I had awful nightmares all night long. Nightmares are usually the dreams I can remember vividly but my mind was blank. 

I was afraid to open my eyes so I laid in bed for an unknown stretch of time trying to breathe evenly and determine why everything in my head felt jumbled. I cant explain it but I could *see* my covers wrapped around me. There were stains that I had never noticed before, microscopic snags all along the bottom from my toenails rubbing across the interwoven threads night after night. 

What the hell was going on?!

A sensation began building in my body; similar to when a song really moves you and you get a shiver all throughout your body and want to cry. Within seconds it was too much to handle and I ripped the covers away from my body in an effort to stop it. Light flooded my mind, blinding me physically and mentally. The agony was indescribable! For those who have light sensitivity during a migraine, magnify that one thousand fold and you might understand the mental anguish I was under in that moment. 

My hand shot out in a search for the covers I had just rejected wholeheartedly. Just as I felt the last shred of sanity slipping away my fingertips found and clung to the edge of my comforter. I rolled and pulled at the same time. My body buried itself deeply in the dark confines of cotton layers and I trembled in pain and fear. 

Just when my heart slowed to a more reasonable pace and the superheated blood began to flow away from my temples my phone rang. Again, it is impossible to describe what I was hearing because it wasnt just hearing but *tasting*. Each note of my ringtone had a distinct taste to it. Maybe if I had a more cultured and sophisticated palate it would be easier to describe but I am a pretty bland eater so tasting my ringtone was an explosion of new flavors to my taste buds. By the third ring my mouth was watering and my stomach gurgled and growled for breakfast. 

Tenderly I moved my hand along the bed to try and find my phone. It was a horrifying experience. My fingertips kept scuttling across old encounters with my ex-girlfriend and as I moved past each one I could almost recall the exact event that left it behind. Right before I reached my phone I even saw the exact spot where my first girlfriend had her first period. I know I had cleaned these sheets a million times since then, using stain removed and hydrogen peroxide and the whole nine yards. I always thought the stain had come out, but I was wrong. I was seeing in a whole new way.

Finally I found my phone and hundreds of bacteria names came flooding back to me from biology class. It was COVERED, every square inch. I shuddered at the thought and brought the phone close to my face. I had to open my eyes to use it. An ultra-bright, fabricated light exploded into view and I quickly dropped the brightness down to the minimum. 

If my description of feeling and hearing are terrible just wait until I try to tell you about what I saw. An intense pressure pounded against my eyeballs with every image I took in. Each key I pressed, each app I opened, each new image crossing the screen had a different pressure and *feeling* to them. I can feel the difference between a 1 and a 2. Ones are soft and gentle, begging for attention like a little puppy. Twos feel happy, strong. Everything has a different feeling to it. 

So here I am hours later, hiding under my covers with my phone on mute and the screen brightness as low as I make it, trying to make sense of what the hell happened to me while I slept. Somehow my senses have swapped? Blended? I dont know if that is the right word. I dont know what I am going to do when I need to pee or eat or drink but I dont think I can take another episode like before. I need to figure this out.

Got your answer? GOOD. Now hold on to that and don't let anyone dissuade you from continuing. If you enjoy writing, if it is an outlet for you, a stress reliever, a way to unload your cares and fears, whatever it may be for do not stop. 

Even the greatest writers in the history of humanity have harsh critics. They only became great because they didn't give in to the critics in the first place. </TEXT>

Keep going, keep digging (not literally), and find out the truth. Hopefully in the process you will exonerate your parents and can be reunited.

I hope they are not actually the cause of this and I also hope they haven't been killed. Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> They say sometimes love slowly grows on you. Years of spending time with a friend or colleague at work getting to know their habits and hobbies and quirks. You know every freckle and mole, every hair style they have tried and what tie they will wear based on the day.

Other times it is love at first sight. It hits your right in the face and you fall deep into love. That is the kind I have. It is beautiful and sweet and surprising and terrifying.

Her name is Elena and she is the most beautiful woman in the world. Even with a bloody nose and torn clothing she is simply radiant. 

Her nose broke when I crunched my palm into it and dragged her into my van. Her clothing tore when she struggled and fought the whole way from the van to my cabin.

As I look down at her and smile from the top of the pit I call Love I just know she will finally be the one. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Stick to the highways </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-13 16:23:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It is funny how other users encounters can jog your memory. A few days ago I read a great submission by u/darthvarda and by the end of it my mind was sending off alarm bells. Like Navi bobbing around in the air telling Link *Hey, Listen!* a memory came to the forefront of my mind. Id like to share that memory with you all today.

In 2014 my wife, good friend, and I went to Ireland for the Feast of Tabernacles. I wont bore with you all of the religious details but suffice it to say I am a religious man and it is an eight day celebration where we get together with members from all over the world to worship God and fellowship with each other. It is the highlight of our year because we get to see friends and family that we might not see at any other time of year due to money or time constraints. It is also a time to meet new people and make new friends. 

My wife and I knew that we were going to try to start a family in the next year so we really wanted to have a huge, last-hurrah kind of Feast before a child made it more difficult to do the long over-sea flights. Anyway, we always wanted to go to Ireland so when the site opened up we were the first to register and, thankfully, we were accepted. 

Our good friend Tim (who goes to our church) is part Irish and thought it would be a great experience so he tagged along with us on our adventure. He is a single guy with a good job so he said he would rent a car and we would be able to drive all over instead of being stuck doing the tours that our church sets up. For those who have done group tours you know why we wanted to skip out on them. Old smelly buses filled to maximum capacity lurching along bumpy streets at a slower than snails pace.

Renting a car was a mistake. 

We made a connector to Chicago OHare and from there directly to Dublin, Ireland. The flight was overnight and uneventful, but gorgeous. I had never gone out of the country (going to borderlands in Mexico really doesnt count) so I was thrilled to fly over the ocean and across the island of Ireland. I stared out the window the entire time! We landed safely and got right into our rental car to head west. For those unfamiliar with Ireland, Dublin is pretty close to the middle of the eastern coast. There is a highway that cuts directly across the country called the M4/M6. This is the route we took to Galway.

We were exhausted by the time we crossed the island but excited to see a cool new city in a cool new country. There is a show based out of Galway that Tim watched so he wanted to check it out and the university there. We poked around, found an *amazing* breakfast place right on the bay and after a few hours of walking and taking pictures we headed back into the car to drive south along the coast to the Cliffs of Moher. We stopped at castles, caves, all the amazing things that we planned out months ahead of time. 

Nothing disappointed! Everything we did and saw and experienced was the most amazing thing, until the next place, and then the next. How could a place be so beautiful? Anyway I am rambling so Ill skip ahead to when the unnerving encounters begin. We spent an entire day on the west coast doing stuff and now had to drive back across the country to our hotel in Ashbourne. Ashbourne is a little city to the north of Dublin so we had quite a ways to go. 

At this point we had been awake for 30 hours straight and feeling incredibly worn down. My phone was dying so I could only use it sparingly for GPS (I had a wall charger but not a car charger) but we had a paper map and used that with great luck so far. Looking back this whole thing could have been avoided if I just took us into the Dublin circle, M50, and then taken the Ashbourne exit but I was trying to save us the cost of the toll and some time so I mapped out a path through the suburbs. 

What I didnt realize, and you may not either unless you have experienced it first hand, is that some of the roads on the map only exist during certain times during the year. Sometimes they are flooded out, sometimes they are closed off so that herds can move freely between pastures. And sometimes the road is just so narrow you would do better classifying it as a hiking trail and should have no business being marked on a road map of the country. 

As I am sure you are now guessing some of the roads that I chose to go on for our merry little shortcut ended up being non-existent or too narrow to go down. As soon as our first road failed us just outside of Kilcock we pulled over and assessed the map, trying to get our bearings and see what we needed to do. Upon finding a suitable new route we headed off. It is now just past 11PM and the streetlights are very sparse. Reading road signs is incredibly difficult due to the fog that has rolled in and we are in a new country with no real directional bearings. We somehow went the wrong way and end up in Enfield so we turn around and once past Kilcock we find ourselves on a new road that leads us to Maynooth. Crap.

Maynooth was east and we needed to go north. How the heck did that happen? The fog is really settling in on us now and by the time we pass Kilcock for the third time and make it into Enfield for the second we are getting frustrated and just want to get to the hotel. It was about this time when I began to notice the people. No one seemed to move or change since the last time we were passing through. I shrugged it off, reasoning that most people look the same outside of a bar, and we turned around to try again. 

It is past midnight by this point and the headlights arent doing much for us against the fog. We keep trying a different fork in the road but somehow end up at the same three places: Maynooth to the east, Kilcock in the center and Enfield to the west. Our tempers are flaring up and our stomachs are growling and the map is starting to become illegible from all the folding and unfolding. The fourth time we pass the same bar I get that feeling again, this time because they all seem to be looking at us as we rumble on by. I am sure if you witnessed the same car go by a few times in the span of now almost two hours you would probably look as well but what got to me was the fact that their faces seemed to just blend in to the fog. Like they were part of it. I witnessed no life in their gazes and the hairs on my body stood on end. I kept this all to myself so as to not freak out my wife (she is pretty much the most easily scared person on the planet) and instead issued a silent prayer. 

It wasnt a long prayer, or even a particularly eloquent one. It was just desperate. Tim, who had been driving this entire time and was starting to really lose his composure veered off onto what looked like a very county, very non-helpful road. We went up a hill, down the hill, and began a long ascent up another. As we rounded the corner a man materialized in front of us with a dog on a leash. I cant say for sure whether or not he just appeared or it seemed that way because of the fog but one second he wasnt there and the next he was. His dog sat down without a single command and he waved to us as we slowed to a stop next to him. 

We began to ask for directions to Ashbourne but he was already giving them. They were perfect. He had us going on tiny little roads, some looked like driveways, two gravel ruts with grass in between, but without fail fifteen minutes later we were greeted with a welcome sign to the city. 

Another few minutes of driving led us to a Chinese restaurant that also served pizza and after that our hotel. When it was all said and done we had been awake for almost 40 hours straight. Ive never slept better in my entire life. 

I am not sure what is was that we experienced that night. You hear stories of evil forces trying to separate you from your faith and make you doubt, make you waver. Maybe that is what was going on. Maybe we were directed out of that forever-loop by an angel. Or maybe it was just a foggy night in Ireland and a really bad map. Either way I urge you to always stick to the highways.

<TEXT> On your left you will see ten complete strangers living in a room. They will remain together in the room for one week or until only one person is left. Inside of the room is one chair, one bed, and one book. Typically there will be one homosexual, one criminal, one hippie, and one corporate executive among the ten people. Of course we have done studies were each individual was of the same job type, sexual preference, religion, and so on, however the results seldom vary. On average a group lasts thirty one hours. Interesting side note  when we put ten cult leaders together in the room they lasted longer than any other group at eighty seven hours.

As you can see this particular group is entering the eleventh hour and already groups have formed. Ah, subject 10 has begun fighting with subject 8 over the book. Lets see what happens, shall we? This is the third fight over the book already between these two. It could get ugly this time. Oh my, subject 10 broke a leg off of the chair and is waving it at subject 8. You may want to look away, the rage in her eyes is  ok yes she drove the chair leg into his neck. 

You would think that knowing they were being watched would change their behavior but it doesnt. We just hate each other so much, dont we? Now if youll step this way and look to your right </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello my new friends. I have been lurking on NoSleep for quite some time enjoying all of your stories and just recently began writing my own. I just submitted the final section (for a while anyway) to my Patient 314 series and I am going to begin turning it into a short story to publish. If you are unfamiliar with it go take a [look](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5ppwqe/you_must_die_in_order_to_live/) and then you, too, can offer advice! That link is to the first part.

My *first question* is to those familiar with the story what do you think is the best title for the short story? I have a few options.

Patient 314 (obvious, well-known, boring)

Inhuman Potential (the one I am leaning toward the most)

Maybe you have thought of one better?

-------------

My *second question* concerns the linearity of the story. I am pretty sure I want to change things around in the book so that it makes a little more sense as you read it as opposed to the order in which I posted it. What do you think?

Please let me know! And if this is the wrong place for my question send me in the right direction. Thanks friends! </TEXT>

-----------

Spring is a beautiful time of year. I had never witnessed it first hand before so to you this revelation might seem a bit odd but we all have little times like these in our lives, right? When we stop and smell the roses so to speak. The cruel, cold death of winter faded before my eyes as new blooms opened and greeted the warm sun rays. Skinny trees began to fill out with new foliage that provide cover to the nests high up near the tops. 

Our train sped along in the general direction we needed to go and I sat back enjoying a process I hoped to witness more than just once. This was my spring  a new life ready to bloom.

Sandman snapped me out of my reverie with a question. *Do you have a plan?*

I do, I said. But I cant tell you what it is, and you need a plan of your own that I cant know either.

We both need plans. But neither of us can know each others plan? Why?

I chuckled softly before explaining. Zero can read minds, yes? And presumably has perfected using whatever he gained from my DNA by now, yes? So therefore he can read our minds, know our plans, and quite possibly kill us without even moving. Not only that but he has a device that inhibits my ability to kill him with my mind or read his thoughts.

Sandman just stared at me for a moment before punching the wall of the train. So basically we cant beat him and we are just walking towards imminent death? Great.

I laughed hard at that. I mean really laughed. He probably thought I was utterly insane, like the Joker in the original Batman movie, because I just kept laughing. Tears filled my eyes and my stomach ached. It felt good to laugh. Wiping away the tears and the smile on my face I allowed myself a somber tone once again.

We can beat him. We will beat him. But you cant know how I am going to do it. Where did Matt tell us to meet him?

Sandman pulled out his phone and pulled up a message from a few hours before. *I dont know how much longer I can hold out here. He gets closer every day. Im hiding in the subway systems under Cincinnati.*

I sat in silence the rest of the way pondering what the most effective scenario might be. More accurately I stared out the window watching trees and hills blur by while hoping I looked like I was deep in thought. 

Does Matt know Im alive?

No, Sandman said. He just thinks I am coming to try and help him escape.

Good. Dont tell him anything. If Zero is catching up to him we need to use Matt as bait. Well need to meet Matt in a place that will ensure Zero is there when we get there. How do we do that? He is in the subway. Is he just jumping cars all the time? Lets bring up a map of the subway.

Sandman grabs his phone and types away for a while before a concerned look crosses his face. The subway has been abandoned for years. It is just Matt down there hiding like a rat.

My face must have lit up like a Christmas tree when I heard that. Even better. All alone, no witnesses, no worries about innocent casualties. How long until we can get there, do you think?

----------------

The train came to a gentle stop at the end of its track and we stepped off. As soon as my feet hit the dusty, worn-down platform the train vanished. It didnt speed off in the opposite direction. It simply vanished. I put my hand out and groped around for the door frame I just passed through and my fingers wrapped around the cool metal. Convenient.

Sandman was shaking his head in a way that suggested he should expect such things and not be surprised anymore but cant help it. We exchanged broad grins and walked a few miles before hiring an Uber to take us into the city.

We ate a quick bite at a food truck while we waited for an opening to slip down into the subway entrance that was blocked off. Once no one was paying much attention we ducked under the boards and made our way down the wide stairs. Graffiti covered the walls leading down and I assumed continued on throughout the whole tunnel but light only made it a few feet beyond the last stair. 

Do you get signal down here? I asked.

The phone lights up and he nods to me.

Tell Matt to meet us in this tunnel and to cover you in his goop so you look like one of his creations. Zero wont think to read your mind and thus youll be safe. Once you are covered just mimic what the others do. Got that?

Sandman nods again, this time with less conviction.

We head further into the tunnel until we reach a fork with three other main tunnels converging and I hopped down into the track to hide and wait. A faint light lets me know Sandman got a message back and soon he peeks his head over the edge in search of me. 

Matt is on his way and Zero and about twenty Faceless are hot on his trail.

Perfect, hide up against the wall and wait until you are inked. Try to think of nothing, literally nothing. The fear is evident in his eyes so I give a thumbs up and whisper I promise we will be ok.

His head slowly retreats and a few faint footsteps later we are immersed in silence. A car horn honks now and again on the streets above. I reach out with my mind and try to implant confidence and strength into Sandman. Soon murmurs and footsteps reach our ears. Each noise echoing lightly toward us. Then louder, louder. More steps, more echoes. It sounds like hundreds of people rushing toward us. The footfalls are crashing off of the circular walls now, pounding through me. My heart begins to race, rattle, pound, thump, revolt against me. Then silence. 

I hear a whisper, then another. Now a steady march of footfalls echo in unison toward us. Zero.

I make my way cautiously around the curve of the recessed track hoping to end up behind Zero as he faces off with Matt and his black army. 

Tired of running, Patient 315? It is my voice, with a sneer to it, and slightly deeper.

Instead of responding I hear a large commotion of motion caused I can only assume by Matt and his minions. I peek up over the edge to gauge the right time. Inches from my face are the heels of Zero! I contemplate grabbing him and pulling him down but the noise above me sends my heart racing once again and I can feel my strength fading. Did Zero just clutch his chest for a moment? 

Gathering my strength and courage I take a step back and leap up behind Zero, my hands grasping firmly to his jaw and forehead and a satisfying snap silences everyone. Faceless turn to me, Matt drops to his knees gasping for breath, Sandman shakes free of the inky gunk covering his body. All at once the Faceless run toward me and drop at my feet. Strength flows from my heart to my fingers and toes. 

No one said anything. After all of that what was there to say? I nodded my head, scooped up Zero and began to walk away.

Harrison, what are you doing? cried Sandman.

Research.

--------------

I awoke in a haze and wracked with pain from head to toe. I havent felt like this in how long had it been? Days? Weeks? I honestly have no idea how long I was kept in that room. 

There was an extreme pressure on my wrist. I was being pulled, dragged actually. Unbearable light penetrated my eyeballs and the squeak of my bare heels dragging along the clean linoleum floors sent horrible pains through my eardrums. It was almost too much to bear, however I had come too far and endured too much to give in now. 

Mashing my eyelids together to block out the light I gathered my strength and pushed off of the floor while twisting. The grip on my wrist loosened, then broke. I had taken my captor by surprise and didnt hesitate to capitalize on it. My hands leapt forward and groped for purchase, finding a familiar medium to mold. With a twist the neck snapped and strength flowed through me. I opened my eyes and let go of the Faceless tasked with my disposal. 

I took in my surroundings, trying to determine where in Site 2 I was. Eventually I just wandered around until I found the central loft that I was familiar with and headed up to the top. Fortunately I ran in to a few more Faceless along the way which helped build my strength back up. At last I came upon a large door that opened up and beautiful, natural sunlight filtered down from ten flights above me. I climbed up the metal stairs and was greeted by the train that brought me from Site 1. 

A sound caused me to duck and dive behind the nearest cover, which wasnt much, just a metal railing. Someone was poking around in the train. I couldnt quite make out the face but I didnt recognize his features as anyone I had encountered during my experiments. He was young and moved with an uncertainty as if he wasnt quite sure what he was looking for. I sat crouched down and watched as he made his way to my end of the train. If he was going to exit out of the train he would spot me instantly so I moved, low to the ground, over to the doors and waited for an opening. 

It was at this point that I realized how stupid I was being. Why not just read the guys mind and see what he wants? I focused on him, searching for the information I needed. He was from Reddit! It seemed like so long ago when I was posting my experiments to that site. Feldman must have taken over my account and continued posting. Why the hell would he do that? Ego, I guess. Anonymous notoriety? Karma? That stuff is a bit addictive once you get a taste. This guy knew just about everything that had gone on with me in that place. 

I broke the connection and stood up. At that exact moment he lifted his head up from the control panel of the train and we made eye contact. I didnt have to read his mind to know he peed his pants a little. The look on his face was enough. 

**314** - Its ok, I know you are on my side. You know me as Patient 314.

**Reddit Guy** - I, uh, umm hey. How can I be sure you are you and not Dr. Zero?

**314** - If I were Dr. Zero why would I be hiding in my own train station? And if I were Dr. Zero I would have just sent up a few Faceless to kill you or bring you down for testing. 

**RG** - I suppose that is true. I guess we will just have to trust each other, right?

**314** - Right. Why did you come here? More importantly, how did you find it?

**RG** - It is kind of a long story but there are a lot of people rooting for you. Feldman and Zero are monsters and we all want to help. I figured I would try to put some pieces together. Hey, umm, I dont really want to call you Patient 314 so whats your name?

**314** - My name. Yea that is probably the one thing you dont know. [extends a hand] I am Harrison. Nice to meet you.

**Sandman** - Im /u/Sandman9913. Lets get out of here. You have a lot to catch up on. 

Sandman handed me his phone with the Reddit app open and I began to read all of the posts that Dr. Feldman and later, Dr. Zero, made on my account. 

------------------------------

I cant begin to describe what I felt as I read about what had happened to me. Surreal just doesnt cut it. I never knew the doctors thought process during the testing and that was quite enlightening. The guy was smart, Ill give him that. The origins threw me for a loop, though. Area 51? Aliens? I am sure there is a lot more we dont know about and maybe one day Ill come back and try to learn some of them.

I admit it. I cried when I read about my mother. That sick bastard screwed with my head more than I thought was possible. The one thing that helped as I read each entry was the comments. So many people hating on Feldman and Zero. So many hoping the best for me. Sandman went so far as to search for me and another guy even challenged Zero. Not smart, Ill admit, but admirable. After reading everything I just had one question for Sandman.

**Harrison** - You read that last entry right? 

**Sandman** - Yea I read all of them, why?

**Harrison** - At the end of it Zero killed me, or at least he thought he did. What made you think Id still be alive?

**Sandman** - I dont know, man. I guess I just couldnt believe that after everything it would end that way. But, like, why didnt you die?

**Harrison** - A very good question. I am not sure if I truly know the answer but my guess is that Zero wasnt very thorough when he absorbed my information and my condition made it seem like I was dead. For all intents and purposes I do die each time I get stimulation overload but for whatever reason the end result of death doesnt come. Maybe I cant die, not fully. Maybe I am already dead. [I look out the window of the train, watching the scenery fly by] So where are we headed now?

**Sandman** - We are going to find Zero and save [Patient 315.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5yhiy6/patient_314_has_a_name_part_2/)

<TEXT> My name is Aaron and I work for a call center. It is a ridiculously boring job but it pays the bills and I know what I am getting into each day, you know? Very scheduled, very compartmental, very accommodating of my OCD tendencies. The company that I take calls for is pretty famous for their bad infomercials and sketchy product but yet we get hundreds of calls a day wanting to schedule a free consultation. 

Those are the calls I usually get. Take their information, fill a spot on the calendar, next call. The reason I am posting here today is because a few nights ago I received a call Id never taken before and pray I never take again. At first I thought maybe it was a prank (we get those a lot, too) but pretty soon I realized this man was serious and I freaked out. Below is the transcription of that call.

03/02/2017 - 7:14PM

*Operator* - Good evening, thank you for choosing [REMOVED]. You are speaking with Aaron, are you ready to change your life?

*Caller* - Please help me!

*Operator* - I like your enthusiasm, sir. May I have your first and last name, please?

*Caller* - [REMOVED]

*Operator* - Great, thank you so much for calling us [REMOVED]. I have a few simple questions I must ask in order to speed up the consultation process. The entire process will only take a few moments. Would that be ok?

*Caller* - You dont understand, I already have your product. I need HELP! 

*Operator* - I am afraid I dont understand [REMOVED], why are you calling the consultation line if you already have our product?

*Caller* - This was the only number I could find. Look, I really need help. I doubted you, the product, whatever. I cant get it to stop!

*Operator* - Sir, get what to stop?

*Caller* - My hair! It keeps growing! 

*Operator* - I am sorry [REMOVED] but isnt that what our product is designed for? I am failing to see the issue. Are you afraid to get it cut at a barber shop? I can assure you, sir, that no one will know you used our product.

*Caller* - LOOK! IT IS GROWING SO FAST I CAN LITERALLY WATCH IT GROW! I NEED HELP! WHAT THE HELL DO I DO?

*Operator* - Sir, please try to remain calm. I am going to put you on a brief hold while I contact my manager.

-Hold music-

[I called my manager over and explained the call, telling her that I thought it was a prank call at first but the terror in the guys voice sounded so real. She patched into the call and took over. I just sat there in stunned silence while I listened to the exchange.]

*Operator* - Good evening, this is Julia, the telecomm manager. Would you please explain the situation very calmly, sir?

*Caller* - OH MY GOD.. OK ok ok umm. So a few weeks ago I called and had a consultation. The product came and I was excited to try it out because I had a blind date in a few days. I admit I had my hesitations about the legitimacy of your claim so I applied a little more product than the directions stated and no..

*Operator* - I am sorry to cut you off sir but did you say that you did not follow the instructions in the packaging?

*Caller* - Oh God is it going to stop? Uh, yea that I didnt really read them carefully. Shit. loud buzzing- I just scooped out a bunch and rubbed it in and took a few vitamins.

*Operator* - Sir, put the clippers down and listen to me carefully. Think hard now. How much of the product did you apply to your scalp? How much of the jar is left?

*Caller* - There is none left. I used about half last night and the rest of it this morning. grunts and the sounds of a struggle come across the line-

*Operator* - I have one last question. Did you use any of the specially formulated shampoo and conditioner?

*Caller* - Uh yea I did this morning when I took a shower.

*Operator* - Ok I need you to listen closely. DO NOT use any more product. Pills, shampoo, condition, nothing. Understand me?

*Caller* - Yea ok.

*Operator* - Good. DO NOT under any circumstances cut your hair, trim your hair, run a comb or brush through your hair. Not even your fingers. All of these activities promote hair growth and that is the last thing we want right now. Am I making myself clear?

*Caller* - Yes but you are really scaring me. What is going on? 

*Operator* - One last thing, sir. DO NOT fall asleep. Once your hair stops growing you will need to wait two full days and then you will be able to cut it like normal. We will check on your in the morning for the next three days for updates.

*Caller* - Uh yea ok, uh bye.

---------------------------

Because I was the one to take the call I had to check up on him each morning. The first morning he answered and thanked me for checking in. He sounded incredibly tired and scared. So far it hadnt stopped growing. The next morning he didnt answer so I tried back two more times, at thirty minute intervals. 

After the third call going to voicemail I called the police to head over and check on him. They found him on his sofa where he had fallen asleep. His hair had grown so long and thick that it had suffocated him. They found over ten feet of hair in his airways. 

Because of this incident we now sell our product in daily capsules and have warning labels on every part of our packaging. We also have a special protocol designed for calls such as these. I beg you, regardless of the product, no matter how harmless or innocuous it may seem, always follow directions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I had to see what story you were writing and couldn't believe someone was negative about it. I love this story! Can't wait to find out how it ends. 

I get those silly comments as well and I try hard to ignore them. It doesn't always work but when it didn't I go and read all of the positive comments and messages that keep me writing. 

You are great, you are special and brave for putting your work out there. Keep it up and prove them wrong with a best selling book! 

Oh and congrats on the upcoming wedding. We just celebrated 6 years and my daughter turns one in a few days. It is such a great experience and I know you'll enjoy it!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me first start out by saying I really enjoyed reading that. It caught my attention and kept it. Good job.

As far as not being creepy enough, sometimes you need to start in the middle. What I mean is write out the entire story and figure out where it is going. Is the overall story creepy? If so, try to find a way to write it in such a way that your first submission holds the creepy aspect and then you can fill in later as updates. 

I have had a few ideas I thought would be great stories but just didn't have a good creep to them until a few parts in. Figure out how to make that part the first one. </TEXT>

**Team Lead** - Circle the home, secure all exit points. Do not use lethal force.

**All members** - Understood.

**Team Lead** - Two of you, on me. We enter through the front, left to the kitchen and down to the basement. Lets go.

Splintering wood can be heard on the comm. Grunts and then heavy footsteps for 78 seconds.

**Team Lead** - PUT DOWN THE SAW NOW, ON YOUR KNEES! 

**Mans voice** - No need for yelling, officer. I am putting down the saw and placing my hands behind my head while moving to my knees. 

**Team Lead** - Check to see if she is still alive. Sweep the home, check for anyone else. All units hold exits.

**All members** - Yes sir!

**Team Lead** - Do not move. I am putting cuffs on your hands. If you so much as twitch I will use force to subdue you. Do you understand?

**Mans Voice** - No need for force. Ill come willing. I wish you would have waited another week so I could have finished my work.

The soft clink of the handcuffs can be heard on the comm.

**TF 2** - Home is clear, sir.

Breakfast delivered.

**Dr.** - Good morning. I hope breakfast is adequate for your tastes.

**98** - Oh yes, fine. The egg was a little undercooked.

**Dr.** - My apologies. You may be asking what you are doing here instead of in a prison cell. Let me assure you, your work will be completed. It might not be in the exactly the same way, but it will be completed.

**98** - I must admit I was a little perplexed when I was thrown into the back of a van instead of a police cruiser and then put on a train of some sort. Would it be a fair assessment to make that those were not police officers last night?

**Dr.** - Your genius has not failed you, 98. You are indeed correct. The men who brought you here are my own creation and you are here instead of rotting in a cell for the next eighty years because of your gifts.

**98** - A fan of my work, yes? Splendid. May I ask why you call me 98?

**Dr.** - You will be unhindered in your research here. Anything you need we will provide you with so long as you cooperate with my questions and tests. You are very unique, 98. Your ability to sense others pain, know exactly what is causing it, if it is life threatening. Truly remarkable. I would like to understand how you do these things and the full extent of your abilities. To answer your question, you are the ninety eighth patient to be tested here in my facility. A great amount of research and scientific breakthroughs have happened in the very room you occupy now. I do hope we can learn more together.

**98** - I see. I will be a lab rat performing on lesser lab rats.

**Dr.** - You have a personal log that you can access simply by saying Patient 98 log. Make a list of everything you need to perform your experiments and we shall bring them to you.

Patient 98 Observation Log

Patient 98 is the first to seem somewhat happy here. It is a nice change of pace from the yelling and screaming and sobbing. His abilities are incredible to say the least. He certainly chose the right profession as a surgeon. Each day we have brought in a new terminal subject with varying issues from cancer to aneurisms and internal bleeding from car crashes. We have also brought in several with a simple head cold or other minor ailment.

So far Patient 98 has correctly identified each situation as life threatening or non-life threatening by simply looking at the subject. He then describes in detail the cause or lack thereof and what needs to be done in order to save the subjects life. At first I believed it to be Patient 98 reading the mind of the subject in order to ascertain the information but soon ruled that out by secretly administering terminal diseases into subjects and bringing them to Patient 98 for analysis. 

What I now believe to be happening is Patient 98 *sensing* the pain to such a degree that he can pinpoint the location and cause of that pain, even if there is no pain felt by the subject. If true it will revolutionize the way we look at pain in the future. For example subject 21 was given an active strain of HIV. When subject 21 was introduced to Observation Room 1 with Patient 98 he grimaced and told her he was sorry and he would do everything he could for her. He then proceeded to hook her up to a clone for a full blood transfusion. We are still waiting on the prognosis of that test. 

He also senses and even removes fear like some animals do. Even with horrible news like contracting HIV or stage four pancreatic cancer the subjects never show much sign of worry or fear. His bed side manner overwhelms them with confidence and hope in an almost mystical way. 

Patient 98 has stated that he sees how things are connected like pain and fear and likely other emotions from brain to body. I believe this is separate from his other senses in that it is an overarching feeling of how all of his abilities work together. This is not altogether unlike reading peoples mind but instead reading the neurological pathways as they travel in the body and connect emotions to physical.

Lastly, he can not only sense these things but in some ways manipulate or control them. In most cases the subject will not need anesthesia stating they feel no pain or discomfort. Much more testing needs to be done but at this moment Patient 98 appears to have nine senses.

* Sight

* Hearing

* Touch

* Taste

* Smell

* Fear 

* Pain

* Death

* Neuroception


I am very much looking forward to flushing out these senses to their fullest. There are many applications for them if we can find a way to harness and utilize them. Imagine being able to just shut down pain, shut down fear. The Faceless will be much more useless with such [talents added](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5y1fk7/patient_314_has_a_name/)

I have asked each one of them for tips and critiques and some have blessed me with very helpful ideas. I would be very open and welcome to having an area for comments specific to constructive criticism. Not only would it help eliminate the random comments about spelling errors and grammar Nazis mixed in to the legitimate comments concerning the story itself but if used properly could really help each story become more and more polished.

I have had many comments posted to my stories that I am assuming are auto-removed due to something that was said. That makes me sad. I WANTED to see what they had to say and now I'll never know.  </TEXT>

The entire area is deserted. There is nothing around but before going back in I'll check around. I think my family all used a staircase to dissappear. 

For some reason I feel like I have a resistance or immunity to the ill effects of the stairs that others don't have which is why it always ends in tragedy.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Builders - Part 2 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-01 17:11:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I need to apologize in advance to you right now; this will probably be long and rambling but I need to get my thoughts out on paper so to speak. It has almost been a month since my first post about my family and the strange staircase I encountered as a boy. Since that first post I have been dealing with taking over the estate of my family. Go [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5rooj1/the_builders/) if you want a refresher on what I am talking about. Anyway I wanted to do some digging around and try to make sense of those stairs in the mansion now that I have read all of the Forest Service stories. 

I arrived at the airport and a driver was there to take me back home to the place I never wanted to visit again. We passed through the town and it was completely deserted. I seriously looked like an old Western movie. Doors hanging on by a hinge, dust coating every building, vines growing up almost every corner, windows broken and trash littering the streets. As the car approached the old draw bridge that separated the town from our estate a wave of emotion came crashing through me. An old memory popped into my head with each bumpy timber we passed over. Suddenly the trees broke and that massive old construct loomed above our heads. In stark contrast to the town my childhood home was still in pristine condition. The land was well cared for and the structure didnt seem to be any different from when I vowed to never return. 

Once we finished the ascent up the long drive the driver put the car in park and helped me with my bags to the front door. No sooner had I rung the bell than I heard the car peeling out and flying down the drive like a bat out of hell. I am not sure why I rung the bell or why I waited on the stoop. The estate was mine now, after all, but waited I did. A few minutes went by before I decided to check the door  it was unlocked. 

With my bags inside I closed the door and shouted out for anyone home. No response. A few feet ahead of me was a round foyer table and on it was a few sheets of paper and an ornate fountain pen. After an once-over I signed the papers and was officially the proud, or incredibly unproud, owner of the family estate. I left my bags there and wandered around seeking any sign of habitation other than the fact that everything was spotless. Not a single cobweb. After checking all of the main floor I went up to the parlor and bedrooms but still not a living soul. 

I started to get a little more panicked not because I was alone in the house but I started to question why I was alone in the house. I had a huge family. Dozens of cousins and over ten siblings in just my immediate family. How could they all have just disappeared? They all seemed so happy and content to live out their days here. And what happened to the town? Sure it wasnt big or anything but it was still rather lively. Even if my family decided to all leave or die or whatever the town should still live on, right? 

Mentally resigned to the fact that I was alone, I wandered back to get my bags and set up in the master suite when I heard a door open and close. Rushing out to the foyer staircase I caught a glimpse of someone running in the opposite direction on the main floor. By the time I made it down the fifty something curving stairs the person was gone and I could no longer hear the pattering of footsteps. Off I went after the shadow but after another hour of searching I came up empty. I warily made it back to the foyer for my bags and unpacked everything. Maybe it was a servant or groundskeeper or a cousin playing a trick on me. My stomach was growling but I couldnt order any food since the town was deserted so I made my way to the larder to see if anything was still edible.

To my complete surprise the larder was fully stocked with all new food like someone had gone to the store today. The fridge and freezer were full of meats and cheeses and vegetables and local milk. Seriously, what the hell was going on? Someone had to be taking care of this place! I was becoming agitated and more pissed off than afraid at this point. Unfortunately when I am upset I binge eat so I sat there and ate a bunch of crap for an hour or so. I didnt even realize it until my stomach started to protest at the sheer quantity of food I had shoveled into my mouth and the unsavory mixture now churning around inside. 

I decided to walk off the calories by exploring the rest of the house and see if I could find any clues as to who the hell was here and who takes care of the place. Two hours later and every room searched I gave up. It was a pretty nice day so I went outside to search the grounds. When I made my way to the back of the mansion I spotted a building a little ways off and remembered we had a separate house for the staff. Of course my luck didnt turn around because no one answered the knocks on the door and after I let myself in I could find no evidence of anyone being there lately other than it being spotless just like the house. 

Back inside I made my way through some of the rooms I had just searched. There was an armory with all sorts of antique rifles and pistols as well as some newer models. I grabbed a few I felt comfortable with and placed them in strategic areas like the kitchen, formal living room, library, and master bedroom. It might have been around that time when it dawned on me that I had not seen the stone stairs I had come out here for in the first place. With a pistol tucked into the back of my slacks I sought out once again for the elusive stairs. 

I am still not sure if I just missed them the first time or if you must be looking for them specifically in order to find them. Like in your mind picturing them and then they are available or something. Either way I found them after about forty minutes of trying to retrace my steps from the memory I had as a boy. There they were. The same as I remembered them in the same side hallway. A massive door at the top that I know Ive never been through. After my first experience with the stairs I was nervous to climb them again but I knew I had to if I wanted to understand what was going on with my family. I dont think I consciously took the first step but rather was pulled up them.

Before I knew it my hand was on the thumb-press of the handle and the door was swinging easily inward. My eyes were glued shut, probably a reflex out of fear. Kind of like when someone is about to make a loud noise and you flinch even though you know it is coming. When I finally pried my eyes open a beautiful, ornate study was before me. I stepped across the threshold and over to the center of the room where a massive desk sat. It was covered in papers and old tomes. Each tome was covered in different colored leather gilt with gold lettering. I started to shuffle through the papers looking for anything about my family but every sheet of paper or parchment or scroll just had extensive plans of staircases. How to build them, dimensions, types of materials, et cetera. There were hundreds of these plans laid out across the desk and nothing else. 

After a few moments I began search the drawers for any clues about my family and found a plain leather tome with our family name on it in a deep red. I sat in the overstuffed chair and began to read. I have no idea how long I sat there reading but eventually my neck and shoulders forced me up and out to walk around. I used that time to explore the rest of the study. I wont bore you with all of the details of what I found in that room because it would take me a lifetime to do so.

The reason it has taken me this long to post an update is because I was in that room for almost a month. Although it only seemed like a few hours, my stomach never rumbled, I never needed to pee, but almost a month transpired. How that is possible is still unclear but one thing is certain. My family is responsible for the staircases people find in the national parks and other places around the world. They are known as the Builders and Caretakers of the Steppes. Each set holds a different power and a different purpose. 

DO NOT APPROACH THEM. DO NOT STEP FOOT ON THEM.

I still have a lot more research to do in an attempt to undo the evil that my family has placed on this world. You may not hear from me for a long time, you may not hear from me ever again. Please do not let this warning go to waste. </TEXT>

I cant do anything with these stupid things! Be gentle, dont push it, we only have one. Stupid obtuse close-minded ninnies! How do you push the bounds of science without taking risks? Just give me one day with them unhindered and Ill know all I need about their race, culture, hierarchy, whatever! Hmm what if it wasnt the only one? What if I made more? Where did that wine bottle go? [low mumblings]

Experiment C observations  logging

What an excellent way to start the year off! Patient Zero and I have been working tirelessly since my revelatory thought to perfect his ability to absorb cognitive information only and not the physical information. Of course that was quite easy for us and we moved on to searching for specific bits of information to absorb instead of all of it which leaves the victim essentially useless. While still not perfect in administration we have come to a fairly efficient method of pulling small parts of information out of entities without turning them into empty shells. 

Our breakthrough came when I could translate that ability onto the system and do it myself. No need to put Zero in harms way unnecessarily, right? Longevity of Patient Zero aside, the real beauty of the process is that I can copy the information and then stick it back into the entity so that they lose nothing. What truly makes this a breakthrough is now our system can replicate physical life forms! By taking the physical information that makes up Patient 2 and 3 we can then imprint that information into a living host.

So far the host has not taken kindly to the new information and dies out before more than one or two changes can take place. I have high hope that we will find someone or something that has a higher resiliency to the changes but if necessary we will need to create a host of our own.

Experiment C observations  logging

There are only so many lost hikers to choose from before you need to give up and move on to something else. Patients 2-10 all failed miserably at retaining the physical information  Patient 4 was quite glorious in his explosion. The research team has been working with Macrocystis pyrifera to see if we can either steal the growth rate from it and apply it to a basic bacteria or imprint the information onto Macrocystis pyrifera in such a way that it maintains its growth rate while taking on all the other aspects we want it to have.

Dr. Feldman

Experiment C observations  logging

We were going about this all wrong from the beginning! The whole point of this is to replicate any being many times over. If I take a human and a mosquito and a sheep and I give them the same information I should get the exact same end result from each so how can I do that? Symbiotic parasite! If you design the parasite as simply the mode of transportation and carrier of information to the host you can then implant whatever information you want into that parasite and it does the changing for you. Again, timeframe is a factor here so we will need to improve that but initial testing has been successful when the host has been less complex than the information it has been given.

Experiment C final observations  logging

With our first successful clone walking around the building I believe we can put the wraps on Experiment C. Continued improvements will certainly be made and we shall observe my clone very closely for the next year for any signs of degradation or failure. It is quite enjoyable to watch a faceless human walking around sneaking up behind new staff. From this point on all mentions of Experiment C will be referred to as Patient 11. 

* Patient 11 must be administered to a living host.

* Patient 11 needs similar biomass to be effective. Too little biomass results in double or triple the incubation time.

* Patient 11 incubation time ranges from three (3) days to nine (9) days depending on biomass.

* Patient 11 can only be accessed by S-class personnel. 

---------------------

*8/3/1986  12:59PM*

Dr. Feldman

Patient 11 experiment observations  logging

Improvements made since the last update:

* Patient 11 incubation time ranges from thirty six (36) hours to ninety six (96) hours.

* Patient 11 has successfully cloned Patient Zero, 1, 2, and 3 as well as dozens more of itself.

* Patient 11 has not yet shown any failures or regressions.

* Patient 11 is exceptional at performing mundane, dangerous, or obscure tasks. 

* Patient 11 now has a new form  that of Staff Sargent John Dansk.

John was the fortunate, or unfortunate depending on your reference point, winner of the strength and fitness competition we held. Instead of keeping all of these fine young soldiers here at the facility we decided to make a staff of clones that we could easily manipulate and control. In winning the competition it was clear he had the best physique and form and therefore was chosen to be the face of Patient 11. My dark humor is getting the best of me. Staff have begun calling Patient 11 as Faceless and it does seem to be catching on quickly. 

The troops stationed here have been reassigned to new bases and a clone of SS John Dansk promoted to Captain. He will be some of my eyes and ears outside of the facility for new Patients.

*9/2/1986  6:12AM*

Dr. Feldman Personal Log

Our clone in Russia has paid off nicely thus far. It seems as though they are trying to determine the human potential as well but in a vastly different way. Steroids, pft. They must think getting into space was more important than getting into the human brain. Obviously space travel is important but knowing everything about our race, planet, et cetera should be higher on the-to do list than traipsing out into the great void. We know of two alien races already and if we ever ran into them on a larger scale they would wipe us out, easy peasy. Just two hundred of Patient 2 would probably be enough if they landed without our knowledge. Who knows, we may have more Patient 3 in our oceans right now and they are watching and waiting. The ocean is enough mystery for me. Lets focus on that, huh Russia?

<TEXT> Have you ever woken up handcuffed to a bed and thought How the hell did I end up here?

Of course you have, this is Reddit and you are all sick fucks. The way in which my situation differs is that at the time I truly did not know how I ended up handcuffed to a bed. Only after a few more punches landed did I start to recall my circumstances and not until years later (right now, in fact) did my memory fully come to the forefront of my mind. I am getting ahead of myself, though, so let me make one disclaimer before I move on to a story of my youth. This is not your typical NoSleep horror. No, it was a personal horror that will live with me for the rest of my life.

--------------------

Cold, freezing cold. It drenched me, stuck to me, invading my body. A 5-gallon bucket now empty of the frigid water it contained now coated me and the bed I woke up on. I tried to escape the liquid but my restraints held me in place. Something even colder than the water was clasped tightly to my ankles and wrists. Once I could blink away the water flowing down my face I began taking in my surroundings:

Handcuffed to a dirty bed in a dim room with a menacing man sneering at my predicament.

He replaced the bucket in his hand with a wide leather belt and I think his sneering became more sneerful somehow. Have you ever been whipped with a belt? I mean really whipped? I still have the scars to prove how much it sucks. This moment is where I received the first scar.

**whooooosh, slllaaaapppppp**

My body jerked away but of course there was nowhere to go and the leather made solid contact across my chest. His arm pulled back and came down again, lower this time, across my ribs. Again and again. Crisscrossing my torso leaving a large red welt and thin trickles of blood behind. As far as I can remember he hadnt even said a word yet. I do remember him speaking after the belt came across my cheek and nose. Blood gushed out and down my lips and into my mouth. 

Why you tryna play me, boy?

I sputtered and gagged on the amount of blood rushing into my mouth, fear plastered on my face.

I said why you tryna play me?!

The belt came down across my upper thigh and wrapped inwards. My eyes bulged and I choked on spit and blood as I gasped for air. I tried to curl up, tried to hide the pain, extinguish it with the fetal position. My wrists and ankles were becoming raw from the jerking motions I was making. 

You think I dont know? You think you can lie to me?

I finally found my voice. It was quite small. Lie? It was all I could muster. One word. I received another caress of the belt for that one word.

You must think I am fucking stupid, eh? I told you to beat that fag up and put him in the hospital.

My mind rewound like an old VHS tape that had been watched too many times  only bits and pieces were visible and coherent. 

*My fist went forward and across, connecting lightly with my friends face. I hit him in the gut once, twice, then pushed him down. Kneeling down over him I grabbed his wallet and whispered Just play along, meet me in an hour. One last shove into the dirt and I walked off*

Another lashing across my thigh brought me out of my reverie and into the painful present. 

I knocked his ass to the ground and took his wallet, Tio. I even gave you the wallet.

You think you can lie to me and get away with it? I got people watching my initiates, dumbass! My crew said you hit him like a little girl.

*Alhandro rounds the corner and warily looks around the back of the gas station. My head peeks up to see him and I usher him over. Handing him the money in his wallet I explain everything. Tio needed me to prove myself, put a friend in the hospital. He picked you because you are queer, man, I am sorry. Alhandro just nods, takes the cash and leaves.*

Yea, you starting to remember now you little bitch? You stupid pussy. I told you to put him in the hospital and rob his ass, not tickle his face and give me an empty wallet.

This time the belt was turned around. The buckle came down on my knee and pain exploded throughout my body. The swelling was almost immediate and soon I couldnt see my foot over it. It was about this time when I noticed my brother down the hall. I only saw him for a second and then he was gone but it jogged another memory. 

*I walked into the game room a bit unsure but trying to seem confident. It was my first time in there  only the high up members had access. Someone pulled out a chair and I sat. Tio, my brother, two other dudes, and I all sat around a poker table. Tio started to deal cards and talk to me. I dont know what he was saying but maybe something about congratulations or asking me if I played cards. After two hands something hit me in the back of the head  I woke up on the bed*

No one fucking lies to me, man. I show you what liars get.

He walked out, then. I am not sure if he was taking a break or going to get something worse than the belt. What I do know is that my brother came in and took off my cuffs. He told me how to get out through the back and to never come back. I hobbled out the back and made it to the first building I could, a library. 

-----------------

Looking back it was probably the safest fucking place I could have ever went to. That leads me to now. I did end up making it out of that awful city and stayed with some cousins in Vegas for a while working construction. I am not sure why all of this came flooding back to the forefront of my mind. Maybe it was the belt I put on this morning for work but then again I put one on every day for work. Maybe it was my cousin telling me about my brother trying to reach out to me for the first time in a decade. 

What I do know is I finally remembered something  I wasnt the only one being tested that day. My brother was the one who got me in to that gang. My brother was there playing cards. My brother was there watching me take the worst beating of my life. What I have realized is that my brother was the one who snitched me out, followed me and told Tio I didnt bust up Alhandro enough. 

He might have saved my life but he was the one who endangered it in the first place. I dont think Ill be taking a call from him any time soon. </TEXT>

FROM: Richard.F.Talbot@51.gov

TO: J.Feldman@MWPW.gov

SUBJECT: Entity Transfers

Good morning, Dr. Feldman,

Id like to thank you on behalf of the United States Military for your exemplary service and dedication to your work and this great country. Based on the most recent logs received we believe that your research far and away exceeds the expectations initially placed on your facility. As a result of this we will be transporting two entities to your facility to help further your cause. The attached documents will outline the precautions needed with housing and testing of your two new Patients. Henry Finebar is already on a flight out to assess your facility and send a report back to me on what you will need. In addition a barracks will be built in order to house a Regiment. These men will be available for whatever needs you may have in addition to security. 

Please continue providing weekly reports directly to me. Once Henry builds the report for your facility we will have construction crews out immediately to get you up and running quickly. I would expect your new Patients within the month. Once again, thank you and congratulations on your recent successes. God Bless America.

General Talbot

-------------

ATTACHMENT 1: SUBJECT A

**Description:** Humanoid in shape. One hundred and eleven centimeters in height, one hundred and eleven pounds. Skin color is a matte grey that absorbs light. Subject A has no reflection nor casts a shadow. Each hand ends with three fingers and a thumb, however, each finger has far more dexterity. Subject A is capable of bending each finger in any direction and can carry out two tasks per hand in comparison to a human. Feet are similar in nature.

**Abilities:** Subject A has incredible strength, quickness, and agility. Adept at blending in to its surroundings, although it does not change in color or appearance. When motionless it simply fades away from vision. 

**Conclusions:** Based on its adaptability and apparent need to vanish into its surroundings it is determined that Subject A is most likely in the middle of the food chain in its place of origin. The terrain is either extremely mountainous or densely forested and bleak in color.

**Precautions:** Subject A does not blend well with the color red  therefore its holding cell should be colored as such, as well as any transportation devices used to move it back and forth. It should be noted that a color change is advised at least on a semi-annual basis. Subject A could become accustomed to a new environment and begin blending properly with red. Alternate between reds, yellows, and oranges. Subject A has strength equivalent to a fully grown gorilla and quickness rivaling a mongoose. Ensure all forms of containment can withstand 100,000 psi and has a set of two doors, an inner and an outer. 

----------------

ATTACHMENT 2: SUBJECT B

**Description:** Slightly smaller in size than a giant squid, but similar in all regards externally. Approximately six meters long and three hundred and twenty pounds. Blue in color. The beak is larger and extremely powerful. Two were found, one dead from impact.

**Abilities:** Subject B is highly intelligent. It has its own language and learned English within three months of captivity, although it is difficult to understand due to the difference in anatomy, it is intelligible. Aside from its intelligence it does not need to be in water to survive.

**Dissection:** The brain is roughly the same size as a human brain and each section proportionate to ours as well. There are no lungs or other unknown internal organs so its skin must be similar to that of an amphibian. It should be noted that each individual sucker has tiny barbs that emit poison from a sac at the base of each attack tentacle. Testing has confirmed that there are two different poisons. One is an aphrodisiac and the other a sedative.

**Conclusions:** In the water, Subject B is an extremely dangerous and formidable foe, most likely at the very top of its food chain. The intelligence and power that it possesses alone make it deadly but the addition of the poisons make it a truly remarkable predator. It is possible that it uses the poisons solely for mating but that seems unlikely. Its place of origin is clearly similar to ours based on its amphibious nature. 

**Precautions:** DO NOT PLACE IN WATER. On land it is much more slow and cumbersome, although still fierce and formidable. Subject B does not like electricity. Excessive use will result in permanent cognitive damage, just as with humans. Keep temperature at a constant sixty degrees Fahrenheit to ensure longevity.

FROM: Henry.U.Finebar@51.gov

TO: Richard.F.Talbot@51.gov

SUBJECT: Mt. Whitney facility assessment

Staffing  Understaffed, however with only one Patient that is to be expected. Suggesting two Companies of troops stationed initially, scaling up to the full Regiment by year five.

Security  Adequate, but outdated. A full revamp will need to take place if the site will be ready for Phase 2. Suggesting a second, emergency exit installed and blast doors on each entrance. Handprint, voice, and retinal scans at each entrance as well as internally for restricted areas. A flood system and shock system will need to be installed in case of site failure, as well as charges on each floor. Expand the no-fly zone.

Accessibility  There is only a gravel path currently. We will need to install roads, a helipad, and high-speed rail for Patient transport. In addition to the barracks the area will need outposts and fences installed to keep hikers and campers far enough away.

Data/IT Infrastructure  Very basic server room connecting a few desktop computers. With the extent of research that will soon be happening we will need a similar setup to Site 51. This is not my expertise so an expert should be sent to assess.

As a side note I believe a second site should be built in case of emergency evacuation of Site 1.

Cost  Total cost will range from $300 million to $900 million

Forgive me for not making a log sooner. The system has been down or intermittent for some time due to all the construction and changes being made here. Patient 2 and Patient 3 have just arrived and are in their new homes! I always knew but now it is confirmed! Life outside of this planet  wow! And I, Jacob Feldman, get to test and experiment these marvelous creatures for the betterment of humanity. 

I cant wait to see if Patient Zero can absorb their information the same way he can Earthly beings. Of course, I have to figure out how to scale back his power first. Dont want to absorb everything and lose one of the most precious test subjects in the history of the world! What a day, what a day. Today truly is a day of thanksgiving. So much to do before dinner with the troops.

Dr. Feldman Personal Log

*5/18/1985  7:30AM*

Today a new chapter is opened  our research will make massive strides forward. My colleague and friend, Irithmus Thar, has kindly volunteered to be our first human test subject. As much as we have gained in the five years experimenting with the local flora and fauna we will gain in weeks or even days with Patient Zero. That is, if my hypothesis is correct. Irithmus has this amazing talent for absorbing knowledge. It seems as though he needs to read a book once to commit it to memory in its entirety. I began questioning how this could be when we started to work together more closely on the human potential. He had no books, no library of any kind, never took notes or recorded conversations or lectures. Somehow, though, he retain all he took in without the slightest error to it. 

Of course, there are physiological explanations for this, disorders that could cause it as well, but usually result in a loss of function in some other fashion. Without any apparent losses I can only speculate that this is a singularity unto Irithmus himself and must be examined in a more secluded and contained environment. Today our journey into his mind begins.

-------------------

*5/18/1985  8:00AM* 

Experiment One  logging

**Dr.** - Good morning my friend. I pray you are feeling well.

**Zero** - What have you done, Jacob? Where did you take me?

**Dr.** - This is where real science takes place. You wanted to study the human potential, lets study it!

**Zero** - You dont know what you are doing. You cant just take people, Jacob. This isnt you.

**Dr.** - Oh, I do and I can. On the table next to you is a book. Please pick it up and being reading. 

**Zero** - I am not in the mood for reading, Jacob. Let me out! 

Patient Zero approaches the observation window and begins pounding on the glass. The shock collar affixed to his neck is activated, sending him crashing to the floor.

**Dr.** - The observation glass is rated to withstand an angry bear. The collar around your neck can be turned up high enough to kill such a bear instantaneously. Please do not disobey my orders again. Now pick up the book, Zero. 

**Zero** - Zero? [He gingerly makes his way to book and picks it up. A small after-tremor from the shock shakes his body.] 

**Dr.** - Now begin reading.

As Patient Zero turns the pages they become a blank, off-white page.

**Dr.** - Just as I thought. What did page twenty eight explain?

**Zero** - The chemical reactions in the brain that dictate short-term, long-term, and ultralong-term memories.

**Dr.** - In your professional opinion, would you say that you only create ultralong-term memory?

**Zero** - Yes.

Experiment One complete.

Dr. Feldman Personal Log

I love being right. After weeks of work I finally replicated Zeroes ability to extract and retain information and have begun collecting his memories. I love this digital age. Once digitized we can then implant the memories back into Patient Zero. On second thought maybe I should only give him some memories back. I suppose depending on what we need him for he could be given information and have things taken away at any time. Yes, that would make the most sense.

I have begun to experiment on myself to see if I can start forcing memories into becoming ultralong-term. That must make me Patient One. [chuckles to himself] Of course Ill never be on the other side of the observation window. Hmm what was I talking about? My memory does seems to be a bit off since the experiments. Would ultralong-term memories even be desired without a fast enough recall? Patient Zero never seems to hesitate when bringing forth information. There must be more to his ability  instant recall, perhaps. Oh good, something new to test.

--------------

*6/25/1985  6:15AM*

Experiment Two  logging

Breakfast delivered.

**Dr.** - Good morning, Zero. I am excited for the results of todays testing. Are you?

Zero eats his food silently. Four orderlies walk in with an exam table loaded with equipment.

**Dr.** - Once you are done eating these fine gentlemen are going to hook you up so that we can track your recall ability. Does that sound good?

Patient Zero continues eating in silence. Once completed Zero is ushered to the table and strapped in. Electrodes are placed in various locations on his body, predominately on the head. Patient Zero is given an encyclopedia. 

**Dr.** - Please read the book. When you are finished I will ask you questions regarding the information in that book.

Patient Zero reads through the book in twenty seven minutes. Each page takes approximately half a second to be understood.

**Dr.** - Page one hundred seventy one, paragraph three.

**Zero** - These specialized plants employ a variety of mechanisms to capture prey, ranging from the passive pitfall traps of pitcher plants to the adhesive leaves of sundews and butterworts to the snap traps of Venus flytraps and aquatic bladderworts. Most carnivorous plants attract and digest insects and other invertebrates, but some large pitcher plants have been known to digest frogs, rodents, and other vertebrates.

**Dr.** - Page nineteen, paragraph one.

**Zero** - Just prior to the beginning of the Neoproterozoic, Earth experienced a period of continental suturing that organized all of the major landmasses into the huge supercontinent of Rodinia. Rodinia was fully assembled by one billion years ago and rivaled Pangea (a supercontinent that formed later during the Permian Period) in size. Before the beginning of the Cambrian, Rodinia split in half, resulting in the creation of the Pacific Ocean west of what would become North America. By the middle and later parts of the Cambrian, rifting had sent the paleocontinents of Laurentia (made up of present-day North America and Greenland), Baltica (made up of present-day Western Europe and Scandinavia), and Siberia on their separate ways. In addition, a supercontinent called Gondwana formed, which was made up of what would become Australia, Antarctica, India, Africa, and South America.

**Dr.** - Page nine hundred and two, paragraph four.

**Zero** - Black Panther Party, original name Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, African American revolutionary party, founded in 1966 in Oakland, California, by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale. The partys original purpose was to patrol African American neighbourhoods to protect residents from acts of police brutality. The Panthers eventually developed into a Marxist revolutionary group that called for the arming of all African Americans, the exemption of African Americans from the draft and from all sanctions of so-called white America, the release of all African Americans from jail, and the payment of compensation to African Americans for centuries of exploitation by white Americans. At its peak in the late 1960s, Panther membership exceeded 2,000, and the organization operated chapters in several major American cities.

--This continued for two more hours--

**Dr.** - Excellent. Thank you Zero. Lunch will be served soon. 

Experiment Two complete.

<TEXT> I dont recall the first time I felt that warm, flowing sensation between my legs. I must have been young because I always seem to remember knowing about it. I just cant pinpoint the first time. I do, however, remember my first orgasm. 

We had just moved into a new home and I had my own bathroom for the first time in my short life. The first thing I did when I was all unpacked was take a nice, hot shower in my own personal bathroom. Steam filled the room quickly and soon I was covered in soapy bubbles. The best part was how the shower head could be taken off of the wall and move around. No longer would I need to bend over or hike up a leg to get all the soap off. I could just aim the water exactly where I needed it! Soon enough I found out *exactly* where I needed it. My parents water bill probably increased quite a bit that month.

Id call that my Awakening. From there I began to experiment. A Sharpie was my first toy. I have never told anyone about this or even asked questions relating to it out of embarrassment so I dont know if I progressed faster than most girls or if I was just another normal teenage girl. One Sharpie led to two. Sharpies led to hair brush handles. Brush handles let to carrots and cucumbers.

Each stage in my adventures thrilled me more than the next. The thrill just didnt last very long. I had to find something new, something bigger or better. Something to bring me back to that first night in my shower. 

-----------------------------

Friends gossip and some of my friends were talking about what they did with their boyfriends. It sounded like a lot of fun and maybe, just maybe, it would fill the void I kept searching for. I am not the most beautiful girl or anything but Ive noticed a few passing glances here and there. One of those glances came from a tall, muscular boy a grade or two above me. He was *gorgeous* and pretty popular as well, which made his glances all the better. Id get wet just thinking about it!

Within a week he was mine and I was his. I didnt know how to go about these things with a boy but he seemed to know a lot. It is different with a boy. Better. Maybe it is because I dont know what he is thinking so I am kept guessing. When it is just me I already know what I am going to do. The only bad side of it is how short he lasts. Doesnt he know I want it all the time? If I could have him inside me every minute of the day I would!

Our first time together was amazing for about a minute. I begged and pleaded for more and after a while he obliged. I guess boys and girls are very different because he started getting really tired while I was just getting started. I was wide awake when he passed out next to me. It was still nice and hard, glistening with what we had engaged in, beckoning me over. I played with it a little and before I knew it I had cut it off and pushed it back inside. It felt sooooo good and warm  but only for a few seconds. Boys are so stupid. He was screaming and bleeding all over but that didnt last too long. It took much longer to clean up than it did to have sex. 

So after that I gave up on boys. They were too much work for such little reward, you know? I began to experiment again and soon found out that I enjoy a little pain. If I added some pain even one Sharpie felt good again! I was so excited! I found this website that sold all kinds of fun things and used my babysitting money to buy it all. Clamps and tassels and oils and things that move and shake and wiggle. My eyes were bigger than my you know, because one of the things I ordered was almost the size of my arm!

Of course all of these fun things only lasted a little while. Once I try something I cant go back, you know? Always forward. I really want to try the huge one but I think it is more like a joke or something because there is no way it would fit, right?

-------------------------

Well the joke was on them because after just a few snips I was able to get it to fit and it feels so good! I just had to make like two or three little cuts so that I could open up a little more, you know? And all the blood makes it so easy to move back and forth. When I say it is big, I mean HUGE. I have to stand up and kind of squat onto it. 

So that brings me to right now. I am starting to think there is something kind of wrong with me, you know? Because even though that felt great for a few days now it is just so boring. So I was over at my friends house and she has this cool plant thing that kind of looks like the right shape and stuff, right? It is about a foot long which isnt all that much but it is really fat! So I stole it and took it home. At first it really hurt, I think all the spines maybe, but then it was better and better and better. But I wont stop bleeding and now the plant is missing all of its spines and I think they are inside. How do I get them out? Please help me because I want to try it again as soon as I can. </TEXT>

**THWAK** *The arrow sinks deep into the thick musculature of the guards shoulder, momentum spinning him around to see directly into your eyes. With a roar he rushes you with broadsword drawn.*

DM: Roll a D20 for your reflex save. Dont forget your bonuses this time.

*The guards blade whistles by you, slicing only through air. Hrann slams his bow into the throat of the guard and draws a dagger.*

Player: Nat 20, hoo ya!

*Caught by surprise at the swiftness of the attack, the guard stumbles backward leaving his neck exposed just enough for Hranns blade to find it. Blood rushes forth as his life rushes away.*

DM: Alright friends, that is it for today. We will pick back up tomorrow at 6PM, alright?

Player 1: Yea bro, good stuff. See you tomorrow.

Player 2: Never miss it.

Player 3: Might be a bit late, my turn to make dinner cause mom is working.

DM: Alright no worries.

----------------

What a great session, right!? I actually killed that guard! Let me explain. I **never** do anything right in this campaign. I am a rogue. I am supposed to be sneaky, snipe people with arrows, steal things, that kind of stuff. The last time I tried to be sneaky I failed my roll so bad Hrann ended up alerting the entire camp to our presence instead of just the guard on duty. We had to run our butts off just to stay alive. 

I picked a rogue because I cant do those kind of things in real life either, you know? My mom says it sounds like an elephant when I walk around the house no matter how hard I try. I am actually banned from this cool antique store at the mall because the last time I was there I tripped and knocked over a massive display of plates and cups and stuff. I dont think my mom had to pay for anything but she was so embarrassed. I think it was her favorite store and now she cant go there anymore because of me. 

You can imagine my chagrin when Hrann couldnt do any of those things, just like me. If anyone else was Hrann he would be so awesome! But no, his stats are awful (because I rolled them) and he fails every check. Call me desperate or foolish but I had had enough so I went online to order a new set of dice. After about three hours of searching (yes, it is a very important decision) I came across a set that caught my eye in a different way than all the others. This one felt right, like it was calling to me across the internet. Even better was the price. Some dude was selling the whole set for $4, free shipping.

Id check the mail every day after school to see if my special package had come and finally, after three days it did. That was today. As soon as I saw the metallic shimmer-paper I knew my set of dice were inside and my fortune was going to change. Hrann would be the back-stabbing ghost he was meant to be. That snippet of the session at the top was pretty much the way the whole two hours went. I didnt miss a single attempt. Not one! 

Once I left I was feeling such a high. I raced down the street to my house and ran upstairs to my room where I had my own campaign that I was working on. I usually test scenarios out myself with a few mock characters to see how the balance works out. You never want your campaign too hard or too easy. I must have lost track of time because pretty soon it was completely dark out and my stomach was growling badly. As I got up to go get some food downstairs I tossed the D20  16. Sweet, a successful roll for food! 

Once I made it down to get some food I realized I had to choose what kind of food. I dont know why but I couldnt make a choice. I felt like the D20 was calling to me from upstairs. I ran up to get it and rolled: 1-10 would be leftover pizza, 11-20 would be a roast beef sandwich. *4* Pizza it is. 

That was four hours ago. Things have gotten progressively worse  like every roll takes a little bit more of my ability to choose for myself. I tried to trick it by rolling for the same thing a few times until I got the result I wanted but now it is rolling by itself. I can feel my body being tugged in directions to do something or think something but I dont know why until I get there.

I just pissed myself. I dont know how to break out of this trance, spell, curse? 

I rolled to see I could post this and it agreed.

--------------------

**UPDATE**

Based on some advice given I managed to make it through the night and meet up with my best friend who is our campaign DM. We got his parents approval for him to stay over at my place for a few nights for a "long campaign". Hopefully in that time we can find a way to nullify the D20.

It is really weird not having an inner monologue and I forget sometimes which I usually pay for dearly. Fortunately Tim, my best friend, it really understanding and wouldn't make fun of me for anything. We get made fun of enough from other people for playing D and D, you know? 

I think I can pass this on to someone else but the problem is who do I pass it to? I would have such a guilty conscious knowing what kind of evil I was giving someone. 

Any more advice would be very welcome!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Never buy a mattress off of Craigslist - Final </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-21 15:57:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5uf78g/never_buy_a_mattress_off_of_craigslist/) | [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5umhqn/never_buy_a_mattress_off_of_craigslist_2/) \ [Related](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5v4wrk/ill_never_go_downtown_again/)

My wife went from chains to cuffs within minutes. We were stuffed into the back of a squad car and the sirens started up. Twenty minutes later we were on the outskirts of town at a park on the river that no one ever goes to due to the smell. The office opened the door and let us out. He led us about a hundred yards away from the car and told us to face the river on our knees. My wife was balling her eyes out, pleading for our lives. 

*I aint gonna kill ya, just need to look like it, alright? Now shut up and listen.*

So we did. Turns out this cop was new to the area, two weeks to be exact, and noticed a lot of weird, off-the-record stuff going on. When he was transferred he was told to take some drug that is exploding out on the streets so he faked it. He didnt know what it was but he figured it was some kind of weird mind crap because the Chief would give people orders no one should ever accept but no one asked any questions. They just did whatever he said. Anyway the police have been keeping this human trafficking stuff hush-hush because it is how they are testing the drug or getting it out on the streets or something. The cop was told to take us out here and pop us since I was causing all this trouble talking about kidnapping and stuff online, bringing unnecessary attention to Downtown. The last thing he tells us is that this will hurt our ears and to fall down and never come back to the city.

**BANG BANG BANG BANG**

I flopped forward like a dying fish and laid face-down on loose gravel and mud. I heard a thud and hoped my wife had done the same. I whispered softly to lie still until we could no longer hear the car. A few minutes passed before I ventured to flip over and found a small key nearby. The key unlocked the cuffs holding my wrists together and I leaned over to undo my wifes. She was trembling on the cold ground and I pulled her into my arms. 

*Its going to be OK, now. Youre safe with me now, babe.*

She stared back at me with eyes that had seen far too much. I am not sure how long we sat there staring or how long we cried, but eventually she broke the silence.

*They took her. Our baby. They took her.*

*Who? Where did they take her, hunnie?*

She started to cry again but it didnt last long. She was spent. It would be the last time we cried until this whole thing was over. She explained what had happened and how Brian and the receptionist used the storage facility to move people and drugs. They lured people up there with all kinds of Craigslist ads, sometimes to steal the person, sometimes to spread the drug. She said the mattresses would be filled with the vials and sent out all over the city. Some of the people they stole were given the drug, some were sold off and some were used as slave labor. She wasnt harmed or abused in any way, just treated harshly but she didnt know what happened to our little girl. I promised her Id find our daughter and bring her back and we would get out of this forsaken city.

It isnt easy leaving Downtown if you are in a position like us  no money, nowhere to go. But I knew our lives depended on it. 

---------------------

I still had all of my gear in the car and since I had parked it off the beaten path I hoped it was still there. Obviously I couldnt contact the police for help and I didnt have many friends to begin with, let alone trust now that all of this had happened, so I was on my own. I told my wife Id be back as soon as I could with the car and Id take her to the next city over and get her into a motel while I figured things out. 

It took me a few hours to make it back to my car but I was in luck because not only was my car still there but it hadnt been broken into yet or thrown up on blocks to steal the tires and rims so all my gear was still in it and it ran. My wife was sitting in the same place I left her, throwing rocks into the slow-moving river. I went as far as I could go before filling up the gas tank. While I was there I pulled out the limit for cash on the card and gave it to my wife for food and clothes and then drove another half a tank of gas away before pulling into a pretty nice looking motel. It was one of those extended-stay places with a little kitchen and living room and a nice hot breakfast each morning. The nice thing about being dead is that no one can come after you when you dont pay your credit card bill. 

We made love that night like it was our honeymoon, or like it was the last time wed ever see each other. I am not sure if there is a difference, honestly. That morning, full from a nice breakfast, I went to a pawn shop and picked up a heavy-duty Taser and a decent rifle. It wasnt as nice as the one that was taken from me at the factory but it would do. I made my way back to the hotel, pulled out whatever money I could from the ATM and then we headed the opposite direction. I didnt know for sure but in case we were followed or my credit cards were tracked I didnt want to take any chances. I only used cash from that point on and went about four hours in the other direction to a different extended stay motel. This one was just as clean as the last and I thought it would make due until I could find our daughter. My wife promised she would stay indoors as much as possible and only use cash when she needed food. We tested out the bed before I left. 

I made a new e-mail and kept checking Craigslist all day to see if I could find any ads like the ones they used so I can try and meet up with someone for information. I responded to a few but so far nothing back from them. I waited until late into the night before putting a few more cameras around the storage facility. Since the cops were a part of this whole thing I figured they wouldnt shut down operations. Once everything was set up I retired to my car to watch footage and browse the Deep Web for anything about infants. I couldnt imagine what they would want a child for and I was somewhat thankful for that. Trying to imagine all the things that could be happening would bring any father to his knees. 

----------------------

I must have passed out because I woke up to warm sunlight on my face and my laptop and phone clutched tightly in my hands. Both were dead. Fortunately I had a car charger for my phone so I was able to get that going again but I didnt have anything for the laptop. I must have left it at the house. Without the footage I could only hope to get lucky with a hit on some of those ads. 

Not too far from where I was parked was an amazing smelling food truck so I went over and grabbed something to eat  breakfast burritos with homemade salsa. So good. Halfway through the bulging tortilla I got a buzz  someone responded to my ad inquiry. This one was for a single-sized mattress. I was guessing that maybe the size of the mattress was code for something, maybe age. After several more e-mails and much convincing I was able to get the meeting place to a local Wal-Mart parking lot. With the Taser in my pocket I waited for the van to pull up.

Have you ever used a Taser before? It is so satisfying. When the gentleman was showing me the mattress I jabbed the Taser right into his crotch and let it rip. The look on his face was priceless. After a bit of interrogation in the spacious cargo area of the van he gave me enough information to believe my little girl was alive and unharmed. My main concerns was whether or not she was given the drug or if she would have eaten at all during our time apart. She is a pretty sensitive girl and a picky eater. Apparently they dont usually take kids but if they do they raise them and sell them as child brides at an early age.

*You are going to go to wherever my daughter is and you are going to bring her back to me. If you dont Ill find you, your family, everyone you ever cared about, understand?*

I took my new friends wallet as insurance. At least I would have his address if anything went south. I could have guessed where we were going. After a few minutes he parked the van up front at the receptionist office and went into a side door. Peeking through the windshield from the back of the van I could make out a few kids faces and hear shrill cries for mommy. My gut was wrenching around  I couldnt leave them. 

As promised my daughter came out in this bastards arms and he opened up the back of the van. The look on her face when she saw me was magical. She squirmed and leapt out of his arms and crawled over to me faster than Id ever seen. 

*How many kids are in there?*

*Um, like five, man I dont know. Please, I got your daughter.*

*Who is here right now? Who is watching them kids?*

*Just the new receptionist, man. Come on, man, I did what you asked.*

*Bring them all out.* I finished my finish with a crackle of the Taser. *Bring them out and then we are done, ok?*

He did as I asked, although it took an agonizingly long time. At first I thought he screwed me and was about to hop out of the van when the door opened and a range of kids came out, all old enough to walk. The new receptionist was yelling at the guy but he just slammed the door on her and opened up the van. The kids piled in with me and my daughter and we were off. About three blocks down I told the guy to get out.

I drove off into the heart of Downtown to the news station headquarters. I knew the police wouldnt help me but maybe if I dropped a bunch of grimy, starved kids at a news desk claiming they were kidnapped Id get a little attention. Of course they thought I was crazy but the state of the kids gave them enough pause to look into some things. I didnt wait around, but I felt like I at least gave the kids some chance, some hope. I trashed the van (they did horrible things with it!) and buckled my little girl into her car seat. 

----------------------

I am posting this from a Starbucks in a hopefully far-enough-away location to never be bothered again. I watch the news to see if anything came of those kids but nothing, yet. Ive tried contacting other agencies to look into the police there but maybe this is the best way, posting here. Maybe with enough attention it can create some change.

My daughter has gained back most of the weight she lost and doesnt seem to be affected at all by the ordeal. Only time will tell. Jobs are hard to come by but we are making ends meet. All we wanted was a nice mattress but my family is safe, that is all that really matters. Sometimes you just have to be happy with what you have. </TEXT>

Have you ever felt like you were suddenly a part of something bigger? In the midst of your standard routine, carrying out mundane tasks that take no effort to complete, but now surrounded by unfamiliar people and places with no recollection of how you ended up there? Id like to share one such time with you now.

u/maddmikeyt and I were cruising through downtown in his ride doing the norm. Leaned back, speakers blocking out the outside world, taking in the skyline via sunglass-darkened vision. Pretty soon I didnt recognize some of the buildings that we were passing and popped the seat up to check out where we were at. 

*Yo, Mikeyboy where we headed my man?*

*Ah shit you gotta ruin the surprise? Just lean back and take it in, son. Well be done real quick.*

So I did. After another few turns we slowed to a stop under the 169. You know how there are those artists that risk their life to tag hard, out of reach places for notoriety? This had to be one of them because the entire underside of the overpass was covered, like it was actually constructed out of tag signs and bubble letters. I wasnt paying much attention to what Mikey was up to because I was lost in all that tag, trying to figure out where it began and where it ended. I was snapped out of my revere when Mikeys door snapped open and he got his ass dragged out of the car.

*Hey, yo, what gives son? Mikey, what you got us in?* I stepped out of the car and into a confrontation I didnt really want any part of. It was Mikey and I and some real tweaked out looking fools four deep.

To me: *Relax, my boy I got this, we cool.* 

To them: *Look I said I got fifty so just cut it and well be off aight?*

Tweaker king: *Nah man this is new, pure, stuff. You dont cut this. I told you it was an even hundy so cough it up.*

Mikey looked over at me in a way every best friend can understand. His eyes, expression, everything about him except his wallet said Ill pay you back, I swear. I pulled out two twenties and handed it over.

*Thats all I got so unless you got ten more*

Tweaker king snatched up it and tossed Mikey a small glass vial. *First time user discount.*

Him and his druggie friends were gone before I could sit my ass back down in the car. I was shaking my head in frustration and anger.

*Look, Mikey, you know I dont*

He cut me off: *Yo, yo I know, Im sorry. This is that new stuff people are talking about. I had to try this man. Ill pay you back man. Im good for it. I got that job at the Store now ya know?*

Yea, I knew. Making more money selling out the back of it than he did working the cash register up front. He promised he would get clean, whatever. 

**WHAM**

Two skinny arms ending in thin, scarred hands came crashing down on the hood of Mikeys car. We snapped our heads up to see who the hell was acting up. Tweaker King was back looking pissed off and high on something. Mikey was turning the key in the ignition when the dude came around the hood to grab at him. Two perfect handprints were pressed into the hood.

*You GOTTA be kidding me with this phony money, man. Pay up, DOUBLE!*

Mikey mashed his foot down on the gas, ripping away from the grip of Tweaker King and losing some shirt in the process. We tore out of there at top speed, looking like a movie car chase where the tires screech and the car leans hard to one side, hub caps flying off of the wheels. After rounding the corner I could hear another engine light up. Great.

*My man, why you gotta stiff em? Fake bills?*

*I didnt think he would notice. I got stiffed by the same bill so I tried to get it back by snatching some product I could resell. Dont be mad alright? Ill lose those fools and then Ill drop you off.*

*You know I cant get mixed up in this stuff, Mikey. I am clean, been clean a long time. My girl will kill me if get busted. Shell walk.*

We stopped talking so he could focus on driving. This was Downtown. Traffic was thick, even at this time of night, so weaving in and out was not easy. Tweaker King was in some riced out white Honda that hurt my ears and he caught up quick. They can really tune those things, you know? He came right at us, mashing his bumper into ours and we both lost control. Mikey spun one way, Tweaker spun the other. I am not sure how but one of their tires popped. It may have just been bad tread or maybe debris on the road, but we were free either way.

Mikey get the car turn around and we started to make our way back out of there but that crazy dude fired up the Honda and came at us, blown tire and all. We could hear sirens closing in so we tried to play it cool. Tread was going everywhere and sparks starting shooting up from the rim when a cop pulled alongside him. I was too busy looking in the side mirror to notice another cop was right in front of us. Mikey slammed on the brakes and put his hands out the window. 

A short time later we are all on the curb wearing cuffs with the cops searching our cars. Tweaker King is looking amazingly calm for a drug dealer. I know his trunk is loaded. Mikey is freaking out next to me and I was just pissed. I was trying to make myself something else, you know? Get out of all of this stuff.

*If I make it out of this you aint gonna hear from me again, my man. Dragging me down and shit. Done with this..*

Mikey just hung his head. 

*I see you boys have been recreating.* The cop is holding up the vial Mikey just bought. *Its a good thing I was on the call. Other guys might not be so easy on you causing all this ruckus. But I am feeling generous today.*

Tweaker King had this big dumb grin on his face and held his hands out. The cop walked over and pulled out his key, removing the cuffs and whispered something. Tweaker King went to work on switching out his tire and eventually drove off. What the

*I am going to give you boys a choice. You can go to jail or you can take this [holding up the vial] and start selling it to your friends. There is only enough for one so who is it going to be?*

Mikey looked like he was about to crap himself. No way was I going to take that stuff. I didnt even know what it was. Slowly Mikey reached out his cuffed hands. The vial dropped into his cupped hands and I swear I could see it moving around like it was alive. I know liquid kind of looks like that anyway but this was different. It wasnt normal. 

*Mikey, dont man.*

Too late. 

The cop removed our cuffs and whispered something to Mikey, then got in his car and drove off. 

*Yo, man what did he say?*

*He told me to kill you once he left.*

Mikey took a step toward me and I saw something in his eyes that told me he was being serious. I ran. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Never buy a mattress off of Craigslist - 2 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-17 15:50:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5uf78g/never_buy_a_mattress_off_of_craigslist/) \ [Related](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5v4wrk/ill_never_go_downtown_again/)

I added this to the first post but Ill put it here as well. It is the note and picture  the only thing I have that the police didnt take [proof](http://imgur.com/u4iBUyk)

So like I said in my first post I unblocked Brians number and tried to get in touch with him again but it said it was disconnected. Of course I gave the number to the police to try and track but I have yet to hear any news from them, which is incredibly discouraging. They say you only have 48 hours to find a missing person and I am approaching that number very quickly. I cant I just cant lose my family. My wife is the sweetest, most loving and wonderful mother to our beautiful, vibrant daughter. I remember when she was born and  sorry. I have been thinking a lot about that night. I guess it is the only thing pushing me on. *I have to find my family!*

One of the comments mentioned checking my car for a tracking device. Dont know why I didnt think of it before so I went out last night before I went to work and after a few minutes of checking I did find something under the rear bumper, on my exhaust pipe. I dont know if it is a tracking device or what but I turned it in to the police on my way to work. Why didnt they think to check my car? Anyway I didnt really feel like working much. I was distracted and exhausted. My boss told me to take a few nights off, paid, to clear my head. I couldnt believe it, not because it is out of the ordinary but he is just a hardass most of the time I didnt think he had a soft spot on him. I took full advantage of it by heading back up to the storage site to see if I could find anything. 

Like I mentioned in my first post I work two jobs, one being warehouse stocking overnight and during the day I work for a home security company called Vivint installing and servicing home systems. One of the neat things we offer is a camera that you can access from anywhere in the world and watch a live stream. Most people use it as a nanny cam or to see what their pets do while they are gone but I had a great idea. Id set one up on the roof and then I could watch it from my work laptop to see if anyone is moving mattresses around. If I could get a visual on the guy we could catch him! So I headed up to the site and climbed up the backside of one of the buildings that had the humidity controlled units.

According to the receptionist they only have 24 of these units and since they are selling a ton of mattresses I figured that is a unit they would need to have. There were cameras all over the place so I couldnt get a perfect angle or see the whole row of units but I was able to place it in such a way that I could see about two thirds of them. Not ideal but better than nothing. The camera is tiny so I wasnt worried about anyone finding it and I know it can run for over 6 months on a fresh battery. 

Since I dont have anywhere to sleep at home I decided Id just recline the seat in my car and try to snooze a little while keeping an eye on the footage. Now I know a lot of you are probably thinking There is no way Brian is ever coming back to that place. And while I agree with you, what else can I do? I have to have hope, to believe they are still alive and unhurt. It is the only thing keeping me going. I am sure you can understand that. 

I must have actually fallen asleep because a train horn startled me and I jerked up, knocking the laptop off of my lap. The train was moving pretty slowly, even slower than most around here and there was a van and a few cars waiting at the crossing. It took a moment to remember where I was and rub the sleep out of my eyes. It was 3AM. I rewound the footage in triple speed to see if anyone had shown up during the hour and a half that I was laying there and only twenty minutes before a 15-passenger van showed up just inside the frame of the camera. It was hard to tell but I am pretty sure it was the receptionist that was there the day we came to buy the mattress. Two guys were hauling mattresses out of the back of the van and into one of the units. I started to get excited. I had him. I found him! Then I got sick to my stomach. From inside of the unit came five women, most of them older but one was pretty young. I couldnt see their faces because of the distance from the camera but I could see that they were chained together and gagged with something. One of the guys gave something to the receptionist lady, most likely money, and they piled into the van and drove off. 

Wait, I thought, didnt I just see a van? I looked up and the train was gone, the cars that were waiting now far off in the distance. I turned on my car and took off after the fading tail-lights, praying Id be able to catch up and hope they hadnt already turned off somewhere. I grabbed my phone and called the police, telling them everything that transpired and where I was/direction I was heading. They told me to pull over and to stop following but screw that - I floored it even more and tried to close the distance. 

Pretty soon I heard sirens from several different directions but I had lost sight of the van, or maybe never had sight of it. When I finally caught up to the taillights I was chasing they belonged to a Corolla or something. About that time my phone went off. It was the police, they had found the van! I drove my way over, only a few blocks east of where I was, hoping for good news. 

When I got there they had two men in cuffs in the back of a squad car which left soon after. Five women were laying on gurneys being tended to by medical staff, but none were my wife or daughter. I was relieved, happy, thankful that they were safe, but also devastated. Where was my family? After interrogation or whatever of the men and the women that were saved it was determined that they would have been sold as slaves  human trafficking. The police are still looking for my family, of course, but they arent acting very positive about the whole thing. 

I just left my day job because my boss caught me still watching footage of the unit and told me to just go home. I know it sounds stupid but what else can I do? I cant eat or sleep or even think without feeling the need to vomit. My family, slaves. Sold to some freak that will do God knows what to them? My eleven month old daughter. So beautiful, so innocent. Daddy is going to find you!

----------------

**UPDATE**

So far no one has come back to that unit other than police. I watched them drag everything out, sick to my stomach. I watched their cars drive off full of evidence. Everyone seems to have vanished that was connected to this aside from the two guys that were arrested. They havent given up any information from what the station is telling me. I dont know why but I started to browse Craigslist again to see if any new ads were put up similar to the one I had responded to. I didnt find anything but I did remember a few stories Id heard about the Deep Web/Dark Web and how human trafficking goes down on those sites. 

I dove head first into that awful area of cyberspace trying to find anything that could help me find my family. The things I found only made me that much sicker and more worried about my family. Who could do such things to fellow human beings? I know we are in a sick, confused world but oh  I will just stop there. I dont want to upset anyone by the things I saw. After an hour of searching I was about to give up when I found something hosted by BMK. I had seen it before and passed it by but looking at it again jogged my memory. The only reason it stood out to me at all is because of the CL ad. Brian had called himself the Mattress King. It is a pretty standard claim, to be fair, but I didnt think I could pass up an opportunity even if it wasnt him. 

I responded to it with an old e-mail I hadnt used since probably high school and got a response almost immediately. $5000 cash for a female. $4000 for a male. Discounts for age. An address to meet at and a time.

When I plugged the address in I was surprised to see how close it was to the storage facility. One of your comments was right, they kept operations close. Obviously I dont have the cash but I have a gun. What mid-westerner doesnt? I am on my way right now. I dont want to be late.

----------

**FINAL UPDATE**

So as I said I like being early and I figured my old pal Brian would be late to this arrangement. I got there an hour ahead of time to scope out the place and find a good spot to take him out. 

I found a nice loft where I could overlook the big, open factory floor. I parked my car a ways away at a thrift store parking lot and walked to it with a guitar case - hiding my .22. I guessed they would probably have a few people out front waiting for me to come in and Brian inside with the lineup of women. Fortunately I guessed correctly. 

A total of six armed people showed up, four taking position somewhere outside. Brian and the receptionist stood inside with twenty women. My heart skipped a beat when I saw my wife among them. I almost cried out right then and there but I stifled it in time. 

I took careful aim and busted Brian's knee with the first shot. I'm assuming he went into shock because he dropped and laid there moaning for the entirety of my visit. My next shot took out the receptionist as she ran. 

The girls started screaming right away, obviously not knowing what was going on. A guy from outside came in but I was already back outside on my way down. I have never been happier than right then about my grandad forcing me to go hunting every year and "earn my dinner". It was paying off! It was then that I called the police. 

I waited until sirens were nearing before I shot the next two guards in the leg. Suffer for your sins. I made my way inside and used one of the guards handguns to finish Brian and the other guy with him after I let him see my face. I don't think my wife even noticed me until I put my hand on her face. 

I'm not sure where the last one ran off to but he didn't bother us as I unlocked the women and hugged my wife. *Where's my baby? Is she ok?*

She just shook her head. We cried, oblivious to the police filtering in.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Never buy a mattress off of Craigslist </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-16 15:21:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My wife and I have had the same mattress since we have been married. It is lumpy, dips horribly in the middle, and isnt large enough now that our daughter sleeps on it with us. I know, thats dangerous and not recommended at all. But when you go six straight months without more than an hour of sleep at a time you eventually cave in. With that being said I am always on the look-out for a good deal on a king size mattress and yesterday I found one. $125 for a *new set*, and not a cheap one either. Incredible, right? I thought so too so I called the guy up and asked if it was still available (you know how sometimes they advertise something really cheap because it doesnt exist). To my surprise it was so I set up for my wife and daughter to go out and take a look at 5PM. I would have rather just gone myself instead of dragging my cranky daughter all the way into Downtown but my wife is pretty particular about the firmness of the mattress so I had to make sure it was comfortable for her. 

Brian, the guy selling the mattress, said to call when we were on our way so he would know when to meet us at the storage site. I called but it went to voicemail so I left one and also texted him to let him know we are on our way. The whole drive there my wife and I are chatting happily about how great it will be to finally have a new mattress and have our own space in the bed once again. My daughter likes to sleep at a bit of a diagonal so that her hands are touching mommies shoulder and her feet are touching my leg. It is very sweet and cute but also incredibly uncomfortable because I have to sleep on the knifes edge of the bed in order to not crush anyone (dads out there I am sure you can relate). Fortunately the traffic isnt too bad yet so we make it right on time. I HATE being late to appointments. It is just so unprofessional and inconsiderate, you know?

I get out of the car and unstrap my daughter so that she can enjoy the cool breeze and point to all the new things she sees while we wait for Brian to arrive. After about fifteen minutes I walk into the office of the storage facility and ask to see if Brian maybe works there or if the receptionist knows anything about him. She told me that he works for a home staging company for when people try to sell their homes. That is why we can buy the mattress so cheap! It is unpackaged and set up so they cant resell it in a store. She assured me he was a great guy and was probably just running late due to traffic. I was glad I talked to her because I was still having a few doubts about why the mattress was such a good deal but his line of work made a lot of sense. My daughter and I walked around some more, singing songs and feeling the brick wall of the building and the nylon threads of the American flag swaying in the breeze. She is a very happy, sweet girl and loves to feel new things so I didnt notice how much time had passed until my wife popped out of the car and asked what was going on. Forty minutes had passed! This guy was ridiculously late. I handed off my daughter so that I could call him up and see what the deal was. 

*This is Brian.*

*Yea, hi, this is Steven. We had a 5PM meeting to look at a mattress. Where are you at, bud?*

*Oh yea ok I am thirty minutes away, Ill be there soon.*

Now as you know I hate being late. I also hate when others are late. *Seriously? It is 5:35PM and we agreed to 5PM, Brian. Dont bother, we are leaving.*

*I told you to call me when you were leaving so that I knew you were coming, this is the first time you are calling me so now I am coming.*

WHAT?!

*Look, Brian. I called you when we left our house and I left you a voicemail. I texted you to let you know we were on the highway. We agreed to 5PM and you stood us up. I dragged my daughter and wife out here for no reason and now we have to fight traffic to get back home. Thank you for wasting our time.*

I hung up before he could get another word in. I was furious. Who sets a time to meet but then doesnt show up until the person calls? Clearly this guy wasnt a real businessman. He called me right back but I ignored it. We needed dinner and showers, we had routines to follow or this baby was going to be up all night. He texted me right after trying to justify his reasoning, telling me I was foolish for not wanting to wait around to save so much money on a $1000 mattress. Obviously this guy didnt have kids. I added his number to my spam list so that I wouldnt get any more calls or texts from him and apologized to my wife for wasting our evening. I work two jobs to make enough for the bills and we dont have much time together as a family. I feel like a bit of a failure but my wife always reassures me, thanking me for working so hard. Still, I cant shake the sadness I feel when I come home late and barely get to spend any time with them so I was extra frustrated with Brian for wasting one of my only free evenings.

Of course traffic was awful heading back out of downtown and there were two car accidents because why not add insult to injury? My daughter was starting to get fussy so I was singing all her favorite songs and making silly faces to keep her occupied. It took over an hour to get home but once we hit the driveway everything was forgotten and we all smiled. Home at last! We went through our normal routine of dinner and bath time and instead of turning on the television I just played with my daughter until she was ready for bed. It was a nice change of pace. I cant believe how big she is getting! 

------------------------

The alarm went off far too early for my liking but I got up and did my best to crawl out of the dip in the bed without arousing anyone else. Got dressed, packed a lunch, ate a quick breakfast and I was off to work. The day was pretty uneventful which was nice because I couldnt keep my eyes open easily. Normally I get a few calls from my wife during the day and at least one picture showing our daughter doing something silly or new but I didnt get any of that today. I knew they had a few plans to go to the petting zoo and story time at the library so I didnt think much of it although I did miss my daily picture. Wednesday is always a special day because it food pantry day (at first we were just embarrassed but we try to make the best of it by guessing what dessert they will give us)! The generosity of people in our area is so amazing. They donate all organic foods, even organic meat. I usually make it home before my wife is done at the pantry so I tidy up the house and get ready to go out and grab all of the bags full of food. 

I kicked off my work boots and put my lunch bag away, cleaning up a few dishes in the sink and washing down my daughters high-chair tray. As I headed into the bedroom to change into more comfortable clothes I stopped dead in my tracks. There, in place of our small, lumpy bed was the king sized mattress on a simple bedframe. It even had sheets on it, nice ones. A few tears gathered at eat eye because I realized why my wife never called me today. She was busy surprising me with a new bed! She must have found Brians ad on Craigslist and went up to meet him on her own while I was at work. What a wonderful woman she is! On the bed was a small, white card. I rushed over to it, flopping onto the bed and taking the card in my hand to read.

Dear Steven,

I hope you like the mattress. Dont worry about payment, I already took what I needed.


-Brian

What the hell?! I sprang up off of the bed and went to my phone, calling my wife. No answer. No problem, she is probably wrapping up at the food pantry or driving home. She never answers when she is driving. 

I waited fifteen more minutes before calling again. She is never this late from coming home. 4:15 at the latest and it was already 4:30. I called again, straight to voicemail. I tried not to panic, tried to let my imagination run wild but I couldnt help it. Was she in an accident? Is she stuck in traffic? Please answer! After another twenty minutes and no response from her I drove over to the food pantry and found the managing volunteer just before they closed up for the night. 

*Hey Terry, was my wife here today?*

*Oh, hi Steven, no she never came today. I was a bit surprised myself but I thought maybe you finally found a better job and didnt need to come anymore.*

I drove home much faster than the law or safety would dictate praying that her car would be in the driveway, but it wasn't. I tried calling one more time with no luck. Sprinting around the house I searched for anything strange or missing. That is when I noticed the picture frame on our nightstand. The picture was torn down one side, leaving just me.

Tears started flowing down my face, coating my phone as I dialed 9-1-1.


-------------------

**Just a quick update/answer of various questions from the comments:**


First, thank you all for your concern. The local police and I are doing everything we can to try and locate my family. I will let you know as soon as I hear anything positive or negative regarding the case.

Secondly, I understand that CL can be shady. I have dealt many times with buying and selling without ever having an issue for many years. Please understand I am in a difficult financial position right now which is why I even looked around for a mattress on CL. We go to a food pantry every week, so yes times are tough. I can only do what I can do. 

So far we are unsure of how Brian found our home or got in. There was no signs of a forced entry and no record of anyone calling or texting my wife/her calling or texting anyone over the course of the day outside of actual contacts saved to her phone. She received no e-mails either. Our neighbors did not notice a moving truck or anything similar come by during the day but obviously something had to have come by. Still no idea about that either.

-----------------

**UPDATE 2**

The police have put out my wife and daughters picture to try and get the word out. I went up to the storage facility to try and talk to the receptionist but it was a new woman today. She looked up storage units owned by a Brian and there was not a single unit. Can you believe that? Over 1400 units and not a single Brian. I mean, it's a common name! I feel like something is getting covered up so I'm coming back later to snoop around on my own.

I also unblocked the number and tried to call but all I get is a disconnected number message. The police are trying to track it to a house or business but they aren't telling me much, which worries me more than anything else. 

Oh and since so many have mentioned my family being in the mattress: the police took the mattress as evidence. They checked it inside and out for clues. They are *not* inside it. 

For those asking for some proof, since the police took most of it I only had a chance to snap a pic of the note and torn [picture](http://imgur.com/u4iBUyk)

Dr. Feldman

The look on Patient 314s face when his ability didnt work on me. There is no greater rush than power. I was unsure if the neural disruptor would work considering our tests were cut so short at Site 1 but very pleased with the outcome. I felt a tug somewhere in my neck but only briefly. It is possible that 314 didnt have enough strength to overcome the device. More testing will determine the true extent of the device. Tomorrow begins a new chapter in his testing. 

-------------------

*2/13/2017  6:15AM*

Experiment one  logging...

Breakfast delivered.

**Dr.** - Good morning, Patient 314. I very much look forward to working with you. For the next few days we are going to focus on that beautiful brain of yours. Youll be given Faceless to kill as you please in order to keep your strength up however your tests will not involve killing. Are you familiar with Star Wars, 314?

**314** - The movies or the government projects? [Eats slowly, deliberately, warily]

**Dr.** - The movies.  [314 nods] Good. The Jedi have certain abilities they like to use to get their way. In a similar fashion you should be able to as well. With practice and careful tutelage, of course. When you are done eating I will ask you to take a seat in the chair. Once in the chair a cerebral cap will lower down and fit over your head. Dont be alarmed by it  it is only there to help map your brain activity.

Three Faceless enter the room, one holding a chair. 

**Dr.** - You may kill two of them in whatever manner you choose. The third will subject itself to your directions. These directions must be spoken internally only. Understood?

314 finishes his last forkful of hashbrowns and nods slowly. Setting the plate down he moves slowly to the first Faceless, snapping its neck. The second is dispatched similarly. Once in the chair and the cerebral cap strapped on he looks to the Observation window. Readings are taken, compared, logged.

**Dr.** - Good. Now give it a command to do something out of the ordinary.

Patient 314 turns back to the remaining Faceless. The cerebral cap begins reading his internal monologue. 

*I dont want to do this. I cant help this man. How can I get out of this? I should play along for a while, come up with a plan. How? He killed Zero. Im alone. Alone. Ive always been alone. I figured this disease out on my own. I can do this. Focus.*

314 looks up, into the blank stare of the Faceless. 

*If I can control this I can get to Feldman. I can kill him. Hurt him. Make him suffer. Why couldnt I kill him earlier? Was I too weak? Focus. Focus.*

The Faceless seems to contort slightly, pinching and pulling of the skin where its mouth should be. A thin crease forms in what looks to be a smile.

**Dr.** - Oh most excellent. A smile on a Faceless! You are more twisted than I am, 314. You may kill it now.

The Faceless crumples as if no bones were present in its body. Readings taken, compared, logged.

Experiment one complete.

The speed in which Patient 314 learns and performs is astonishing. I wouldnt believe it unless I saw it with my own two eyes. It helped to be able to hear his thought process  such focus! A lifetime of isolation and suffering honed his resolve far beyond anything I have seen in previous Patients. 314 has shown considerable command over mental coercion in the first three experiments. In addition, several gaps in my understanding of his ability have been filled. After review of the data collected by the cerebral cap I now have pinpointed several neural paths that only his brain seems to take. Tomorrow we will attempt to perfect mental coercion and begin reading minds. If I am correct that will give me enough data to complete mapping his neural paths and design an algorithm to match it. 

------------------

*2/14/2017  6:15AM*

Experiment four  logging

Breakfast delivered.

**Dr.** - Good morning, 314. Please have a seat in the chair once again and we may begin. 

314 sits and eats, the cap descending down onto his head as the last bite is swallowed.

**Dr.** - You progressed very well yesterday, so well in fact, that I think you are ready to begin pulling from their minds instead of pushing into their minds. Try to ascertain what the Faceless are thinking. I have programmed them to think of several things, each one for twenty seconds before thinking of the next. 

A Faceless walks in with a chair and sits three feet from Patient 314. The blank stare gives nothing away. 

*What are you thinking? What stupid, pointless thought does he have flashing across your brain right now? Focus. Where did I push thoughts yesterday? Yes, ok. What are they saying? Focus! How can you read the mind of a doctor if you cant read the mind of a blank-faced zombie? FOCUS! Animal. Four-legs. White? Wooden. Paint. I must have run out of time, new thought.

**314** - The first was an animal, maybe a white shaggy dog.

*Brass. Its large. Focus! Hinges.*

**314** - A door.

*Fast. Powerful. Click-click-clack. What is that? A sound? A game? Typing!*

**314** - A computer.

**Dr.** - Good, keep going.

*Red. Short. Heat. Inferno. Water. Dog. This makes no sense what is this? Focus! Metal dome. A siren.*

**314** - A fire hydrant.

**Dr.** - An excellent first attempt, 314. Of course people dont think at such a slow rate under normal conditions so the next test will be 10 seconds per thought and each thought will be more involved. Now Id like you to push a thought into the Faceless head so that it kills itself.

314 looks from the Dr. to the Faceless. *Stop breathing* The gentle rise and fall of its chest ceases. A tremor slowly builds in its body, muscles give out from a lack of oxygen. The Faceless drops in a heap to the floor, the last thought still lingering in its mind long after.

The mapping is complete. By the end of the day Patient 314 was able to successfully determine 90% of thoughts at one second intervals. Even with this accelerated testing he never seemed to wear down. Of course, more testing would be preferable but my timetable has changed. With a complete neural map I should be able to stop both incoming and outgoing information from my brain with the disruptor. Tomorrow Ill put it to the test, as well as testing whether or not I can duplicate his ability. 

-----------------

*2/15/2017  6:15AM*

Dr. Feldman opens the door to Observation Room 1 and closes it behind him. Patient 314 watches warily from his cot as the doctor sits down in the chair he has grown to hate as much as the cell.

**Dr.** - Good morning, Patient 314. I apologize for a lack of breakfast this morning but I did not see much point in it. Today is a big day for us. Id like for you to try and read my thoughts.

A moment passes before 314 grimaces in pain.

**314** - I cant.

**Dr.** - I see. If you would please, push a thought into my mind. Tell me to hurt myself in some way.

Another moment goes by. Sweat forms on 314s brow and pain flashes across his visage.

**Dr.** - Good, the device is working. You see, by watching and mapping how your brain works when you push and pull thoughts I was able to create a means of breaking that connection.  I was fairly certain the device would work but the real test is right now.

**314** - Oh? And that is what exac

314 can no longer move. Fear fills his eyes like a spooked doe in the open field. Dr. Feldman stands up slowly and walks up to 314, placing his hands on each side of the teenagers head. Memories, thoughts and ideas, the very structure of Patient 314 flows into the man that looked like Dr. Feldman. 

Patient Zero lets go of his head and steps back, the body tipping back lifelessly. He stares at the body he now mimics and smiles as a Faceless walks into the room.

**Zero** - Ah, just in time. Dispose of the boy. I have a [plane to catch.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5u9s1m/hide_seek_with_dr_feldman/) </TEXT>

Zeros personal log - 

Patient 314 is sleeping. I have reviewed all of the mental memory from Feldman  we are just under eight hours away from Site 2. According to the Phase 3 time table we should make it there before they are in full swing. These fuckers are quick. Task forces are already being reassigned to the new site and the data dump that Feldman did is being uploaded. Until that is complete they wont have any real security features online that can contain us once we are in. My hope is that we can get there before the upload is complete. 

-----------------

*2/12/2017  6:42AM*

Patient 314 awakens.

**Zero** - Eat this, you will need your strength.

**314** - Thanks. So what is the plan? Why do you even need me if you have all of Feldmans memory? 

314 begins eating. 

**Zero** - Having all of the knowledge, schematics, access codes, those are all important. But you are the weapon. I know *about* the abilities of the other Patients but I cant **do** them. Feldman didnt get very far with your mom or you on *how* you do what you do which means I cant do what you do either. What I did know is that I couldnt trust any of the remaining Patients to help me do this except for you. 

**314** - Wait, what do you mean get far with my mom? He took my mom? 

**Zero** - Your mother was Patient 313. She had the same mental ability you have. That is how he even knew about you in the first place. 

**314** - So... that wasnt a clone, was it? [Zero shakes his head] I killed my mom

**Zero** - Im very sorry. But that is how I knew youd help me stop this bastard. 

314 buries his head in his hands, entire body heaving with silent sobs. I put a hand on his shoulder before walking away towards the other end of the train car.

----------------

*2/12/2017  7:09AM*

314 looks up, eyes bright red and puffy. 

**314** - Whats the plan?

I smile.

------------------

*2/12/2017  11:10AM*

The train glides to a stop inside of what looks to be an abandoned warehouse. 314 and I exit the train and are greeted with nothing but a metal staircase leading down. 

**Zero** - Alright, follow me. If we cross paths with anyone let me do the talking.

314 nods and we begin the descent downward, feet echoing loudly in the narrow stairwell. After ten flights we arrive at the concrete landing. I approach the large steel door and place my hand onto the palm reader while staring into the retinal scanner.

**System** - Dr. Feldman recognized, access granted.

The airlock releases in a quiet hiss, massive bolts sliding into the walls, ceiling, and floor  light filters out into the dim landing as the door opens.

**314** - What do I do if Feldmans clone tries to come in?

*2/12/2017  1:41PM*

The clone of Dr. Feldman walks in to see 314 directly in front of him and falters mid step. 314 focuses on breaking his knees, knowing Zero told him to keep him alive. Confusion creeps across 314s face when nothing seems to happen. In an instant the clone is lunging forward, fist outstretched. 314 tries to move out of the way but takes a glancing blow to the cheek and the lunging body follows, crashing into each other and falling to the floor. An object, blurred by the nearness and the sped, crosses 314s vision. Then black.

------------

*2/12/2017  5:06PM*

**Dr.** - I see you are finally waking up. Let me be the first to welcome you to Site 2.

**314** - Site 2? Wha.. what? Uhmmm [rolls over gingerly, holding the side of his head] 

Patient 314 slowly brings his head up to look around. Four walls, one observation screen, one cot.

**Dr.** - I must thank you. In coming here I can pick up where we left off at Site 1. I wasnt quite finished with your testing, you know.

**314** - Zero. What happened to Zero?

**Dr.** - Ah, Zero. You can thank him for making all of this a reality. Without his ability this facility would probably not exist. It was unfortunate to have to kill him, especially in such a vulnerable state. He didnt even look up when I wrapped my hands around his throat. 

314 trembles with rage. Tears stain his face. 

**314** - I wont help you. I wont!

Dr. Feldman takes out his phone and presses a few buttons. A blinding light and horrible screech fills Observation Room 1. It seems to go on forever.

**Dr.** - Oh I think you will. Without a kill youll be in the same sad, pathetic state you were just a few weeks ago. Any passing fart will send your weak heart into convulsions. Do you want to be like that again, 314?

**314** - I lived my whole life like that. Ill suffer it if it means you dont get what you want.

**Dr.** - Hmm. Be that as it may, if you dont mind please feel the nape of your neck for me. [314s hand slowly moves to the back of his head] Do you feel that slight bump? That is the Z implant. If I press a button it is activated. If you try to take it out it is activated. Do you know what it does, 314? It gives me complete access to your mind. You are my little zombie pet, hence the Z. I can make you do *anything*. Anything, 314. So I dare say that you will help me whether you want to or not. I was able to test on your mother for quite a while before her lack of will became a roadblock. But you see, now I know that your ability is hereditary. You will be my factory, impregnating thousands of women so that I can test on all of your special offspring. Oh yes, I will get what I want.

Patient 314 watches from the back of a high-speed railcar. The mountain seems to shudder slightly. 

**Zero** - As I was saying, I am not Dr. Feldman. In there I was referred to as Patient Zero just as you are Patient 314. I was the first, the reason all of this is even happening. 

**314** - So who are you really? How did you know how to get out of there?

**Zero** - Who I am is not important, young man. What I can do is the important thing. Dr. Feldman and I were colleagues once, doing research for our joint thesis on the human potential. I was trying to find out more about myself, my ability. He was trying to make himself better.

**314** - And what is your ability?

**Zero** - To put it in basic terms I absorb information and I never forget anything. The downside is that whatever information source I absorb is destroyed in the process. If I read a book the pages are wiped clean. If I take someones memory they die. I was careless with it early on in my life before I understood the need for such caution and it caught up with me. Dr. Feldman was a brilliant man. He figured out there was something special about me during our short time together as researchers. What I didnt know was that he was already working for Mt. Whitney Research.

**314** - But you look like him, too. So you shape shift?

**Zero** - The reason a living thing dies when I absorb their information is because I take ALL of it, down to the DNA that dictates how they look. We went for a weekend camping trip to take a break from our thesis but it was a set-up. I was locked away in that mountain ever since. He figured out how to extract the information I had absorbed and built almost everything off of that information. He designed an implant that mimicked my ability. It absorbed information down without destroying it. With each new Patient he was able to put together one puzzle piece at a time of the full human potential. You might have been the last piece.

**314** - Me? Why?

**Zero** - Because with you he could unlock the secret to escaping death. While I absorbed *information* you absorbed *life*! If he could harness that and manipulate it in the right way it would enable everlasting life. Not to mention the nifty tricks you can do with your mind. He hit the jackpot when he found you and your mother. 

**314** - Mom [314 looks out the window at the rapidly fading mountain] Why did you save me?

**Zero** - Because Feldman activated Phase 3. All his research was transferred to Site 2. His clone is probably already at work trying to locate the next Patient. [Were going to stop it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5u0d4q/site_2/)

<TEXT> I will start by stating a disclaimer: there is only so much I can divulge and my answers will most likely be too vague for your liking. Now to "answer" your questions. 

1. We observe our patients with a system of implants that detect a great multitude of reactions occurring in the body. We try our best to create a baseline with which to compare to, in this case the coefficient of 1.3.

2. The disease is singular to Patient 314. At this time there is still much to learn and uncover. The hereditary link between Patient 313 and 314 is specific to the mental abilities. 

3. We understand the way in which their mental capabilities manifest but not how to manifest them. Therefore we can block the means of their power from leaving the confines of the observation room. 

4. Almost every one of our patients are unique in their abilities or reasoning for being under observation. Patient 313 was our first telekinetic. I am able to theorize about 314 because of the months I had previously with 313.

I hope this is sufficient for you.

Observations from experiment six  logging

 

Patient 313 continues to decline. She has not slept the past three nights and still refuses to eat. Today we will be forced to run an IV and tube feed her to regain her strength based on our interactions in the coming hour. She must remain alive. It is hard to judge whether she is refusing to use her mental capabilities or if she is too weak to use them effectively. 

 

Experiment three showed such promise. It seems like a lifetime ago when I was excited about her test results. Today we will repeat experiment five again in hopes of determining whether or not multiple subjects can be terminated. 

 

---------------------

 

*9/13/2016  6:15AM*

 

Experiment seven  logging

 

Breakfast delivered. Patient 313 makes no indications of getting up. 

 

**Dr.** - 313, please eat. You need your strength.

 

**313** - Dont act like you care about me. 

 

**Dr.** - You know that I [313 interrupts]

 

**313** - You abducted me from my home, my son left all alone, locked up in a room defenseless. You keep me isolated in a small room with nothing but news and hospital food to eat. You are a monster, *Doctor*.

 

**Dr.** - You dont like the food?  Ill look into that. And like I have said before, your son is safe and being watched after. He doesnt even know that [313 interrupts again]

 

**313** - That you replaced me with one of your fucking clones? No of course, that makes it all better. MY SON NEEDS HIS MOTHER. NOT A DAMNED CLONE!

 

The lights begin to flicker. A small crack forms in the center of the observation window as Patient 313 moves deliberately towards it. Fifteen Faceless rush into the room to apprehend Patient 313. Twelve are killed before a needle finds a home in her neck. The crack has become a massive spider web in the glass. She is taken to a maximum security cell where a feeding tube and IV are administered.

 

She is kept in an induced coma for seven days while her body is replenished with nutrients and back in balance. Drug Z is implanted.

Medical evaluation of Patient 313  logging

 

313s eyes fluttered open as the last of the IV fluid left her system. She slowly turned her neck one way, then the other.

 

**Dr.** - Good morning. Dont try to sit up yet. It will take most of the day for the grogginess to fade completely. There is some food next to you when you are ready.

 

**313** - What did you do? 

 

**Dr.** - You were malnourished and in a very agitated state when we last spoke. It was necessary to remove you from the observation room while we made the necessary improvements to it. I dont think youll be cracking the observation window any time soon. Nor do I think you should try.

 

**313** - Ill do whatever the hell I want. Kill me if you dont like it.

 

**Dr.** - I have better options that killing you but I certainly hope it doesnt come to that. You are special, 313. We can learn a lot from you. 

 

**313** - Youll get nothing else from me you bastard. I promise you that!

 

Patient 313 begins sitting up, slapping the meal tray away and pulling tubing out of her arms.

 

**Dr.** - I see. It was a pleasure working with you.

 

Dr. Feldman activates Drug Z. The change in Patient 313 is immediate.

Observations from experiment twenty eight  logging

 

This will be the last observation log for Patient 313Z. She has done as much as she can in her current state of mind. There is only so far a controlled mind can go when testing mental capabilities. Below is a summary of her accomplishments:

 

* Able to kill up to six individuals at once

* Able to push thoughts into an individuals mind

* Able to block out pain up to a pain threshold of a gunshot wound

* Able to learn at a heightened rate

 

Tomorrow we will do a full medical screen for genetic markers and scan for matches. Once the scan is complete the full autopsy can be scheduled.

Patient 313Z medical summary  logging

 

We found some very interesting things, very interesting indeed. Patient 313Z has a marker we have never seen before which may attribute to her ability. Much more testing needs to be done to determine if this is the case but preliminary research indicates the marker determines higher brain functions. Her autopsy is postponed until all research is complete.

Patient 314 Personal Log

*2/9/2017  10:23PM*

I guess I need to eat my words a bit. He said today would be fun and it WAS! Sure, yeah it started out kind of slow but shooting a gun was invigorating, mesmerizing even. The power inside of that tiny little weapon is astounding. I wouldn't mind taking it up as a hobby someday but who needs a gun when you can visualize severing the spinal cord and it actually happens? Well I guess I dont know if the spinal cord severed but the dad-clone died so whatever I did to it killed it. How did he know I could do that? I guess since I am patient 314 that means there were 313 before me but the real question is where they *like* me or were they all different? Like, different abilities and stuff? I am going to ask some questions tomorrow. 

------------------

Dr. Feldman

*2/9/2017  10:59PM*

Observations from experiment four  logging

Patient 314 has shown more promise in four days than any other patient in a months time. I do not think that we have seen anywhere close to his maximum potential. 314 is also becoming a bit more interactive  this can only be taken in a positive way. Only two other patients have reacted positively once testing began. He appears to be settling in to his routine nicely. 

As I theorized, an isolated kill is very static, and only fluctuates with emotional connection. This is important for a great many applications where emotion must be removed from a situation. When multiple beings are killed there is a multiplier factor of 1.3. This is possibly linked to adrenaline or a similar effect to runners high  more testing will be done to determine the exact cause. 

It should also be noted that the method of killing plays a factor. Patient 314 gained more from killing with the knife than he did with the pistol. He does seem to favor using his hands when killing. This might tie in with the emotion aspect. 

Most exciting of all is having another patient with the mental ability. Patient 313 was a complete failure in the testing environment however the discovery of her mental abilities led us to Patient 314 so I shouldnt be too hard on her. Where she failed he has succeeded! Autopsy on the Faceless that 314 failed to kill showed some damage to the neck similar to whiplash and minor internal bleeding on the brain. Autopsy on the clone showed a cleanly severed spinal cord. If we can somehow find a way to translate that result without the personal/emotional connection I am getting ahead of myself. 

Tomorrow will be interesting. 

-----------------

*2/10/2017  6:15AM*

Experiment five  logging

Breakfast delivered. 314 appears contemplative and relaxed while he eats. 

Sixteen subjects enter the room just as Dr. Feldman begins to speak.

**Dr.** - Good morning, 314. Today we will attempt to verify a few theories I have. In front of you is a mixture of Faceless and clones of your Father, Mother, and myself. Each one is holding a different weapon. Those without a weapon you will kill with your bare hands, except the very last which must be killed with your mind. On my mark move to the first subject. Please wait thirty seconds between each kill. Proceed.

Readings are taken, compared, logged. 

314 moves to the first subject. When he finds himself in front of the last he locks eyes with the subject. Blood seeps slowly out of the mouth, nostrils, eyes, and ears of the subject as it crumples to the clean, white floor.

Readings are taken, compared, logged.

A powerful strobe lashes out, blindingly bright, accompanied by a thunderclap of sound.

Readings are taken, compared, logged.

**Dr.** - Wonderful, simply marvelous! Sixteen more are coming in now. This time I would like for you to try and mentally kill the first subject AND the last subject. Proceed.

314 approaches the first subject. Sweat begins beading on his forehead. His breathing grows harsher.

**Dr.** - 314, enough. Use your hands and move on to the next. 

314 moves down the line with more violent intent. When he steps in front of the final subject the neck twists swiftly in a full 360 degrees. 314s hands never left his sides. 

**Dr.** - Perfect, thank you 314. I am sure you need some rest so Ill have a snack brought and we can resume at 8.

**314** - How did you know I could do that? You know, with my mind?

**Dr.** - I suppose you deserve a few answers. Patient 313 had similar mental capabilities. Once an ability is discovered in one Patient we check every Patient for those abilities as well.

**314** - Are there other Patients here? Can I meet them? Can I meet 313?

**Dr.** - Youve already met Patient 313.

Dr. Feldman walks away and a tray with sliced meats and cheeses is brought it. 314 eats in silence.

------------------

*2/10/2017  8:00AM*

Experiment five, continued  logging

**Dr.** - How are you feeling, 314? Have you had any headaches or eye strain?

**314** - Not yet, no. Was that an issue with 313?

**Dr.** - It was, among others. We are going to continue the testing now if that is ok.

Three clones of Dr. Feldman enter the observation room. 

**Dr.** - If you would, please try to kill each one mentally.

**314** - [mumbles] Like this world needs more crazy doctors running around

Patient 314 stays on his cot but focuses on the first clone. His knuckles turn white as his grip tightens on the edge of the cot, then the clone crumples to the floor. Readings are taken, compared, logged.
314s neck bulges and strains as the second clone drops to the floor, twitching slightly twice. A large vein is standing out on 314s forehead and gleams with sweat. Readings are taken, compared, logged.
A guttural yell escapes the lips of Patient 314. His concentration has forced him to stop breathing, his head vibrating back and forth.

**Dr.** - Breathe. Recollect yourself. Then try again.

Patient 314 leans back, drawing in a large breath. Again. Again. The color in his hands and face start to return to normal. He locks eyes with the last clone  twenty seconds later it drops lifelessly to the floor. Readings are taken, compared, logged.

**Dr.** - I believe we have found your threshold. There will be one more test today but it can wait until just before dinner. A second channel has been added to your television. Please try to rest.

----------------

*2/10/2017  11:15AM*

Lunch delivered. Patient 314 awakened by the sound of the tray. Television mode is activated while 314 eats.

-------------------

*2/10/2017  4:00PM*

Experiment five, continued  logging

Six Faceless enter the room.

**Dr.** - This is the last test of the day. I would like you to kill four with your hands. Then try to kill the remaining two at the same time with your mind.

**314** - Are you kidding? At the same time? How am I going to do that?! 

**Dr.** - How do you kill one? You visualize the action and carry out the action with your mind. Try to visualize them both.

314 sighs and closes his eyes. He rubs his temples for a minute before looking up at the Faceless. Breathing is slow and even. Eventually two thuds resonate through the room. Readings are taken, compared, logged.

**Dr.** -  [whispers] Yes 
[to 314] How do you feel?

**314** - Tired. Could I meet 313 again?

**Dr.** - I am afraid that isnt possible anymore. You killed her yesterday. 

[ADDENDUM TO LOG] - Patient 314 killed her two days before. See Day 3.

Patient 314 Personal Log

*2/8/2017  8:17PM*

I feel like I am being conditioned, like I am a bad dog in obedience school. To a degree I understand what Dr. Feldman is doing and why but I hate not being in control of the experiments. I felt like I was getting closer to a cure on my own! I didnt need this beady-eyed prick force-feeding me little kids and raping my eyes with blinding lights. Eff it. At least he said today was the last day for all of the back and forth shit. Tomorrow would be fun, he said. Id like to say I dont trust him but what choice to I have? It is going to happen one way or another. What I dont get is how they have clone tech. Like, I know it wasnt my mom but at the same time it was impossible not to think it was her. Her voice, expressions, everything was perfect. Then that smug bastard throws a clone of himself in here. Probably testing me to see how much I hate him. A lot, man. A whole effing lot.

Observations from experiment three  logging

Patient 314 has stabilized. There was concern at first due to the nature of our testing, of course, but his resolve is incredibly high. This is most likely caused by the extreme isolation he has already endured. Testing has determined that size or age of the individual is not a factor in the amount of strength 314 gains from each kill, but rather emotional bonds. It is still undetermined whether positive emotions or negative emotions such as love and calm versus hate and fear change the amount but we will revisit that at a later date. A most interesting note - the highest amount of strength gain did not come from killing me but actually his mother. Very much looking forward to testing my theory on why that was.

By the end of the day we determined the amount of sensory stimulation needed to bring 314 down to his zero point: the point where he does not hurt from sensations but is not above normal human ability. We also determined that 314 actually goes slightly beyond the normal levels of human strength, speed, and agility after killing, thus enabling the next kill to be easier.

Tomorrow will be an exciting day. 

--------------------

*2/9/2017  6:15AM*

Experiment four  logging

Breakfast delivered. 314 eats hungrily. Readings are taken, compared, logged.

Six individuals enter the room. Each one is faceless and naked.

**Dr.** - Good morning, 314. Before you is the first round of tests for the day. If you would please kill one, then wait until my signal, kill two and wait for my signal, then the last three. I also need you to be consistent in your actions.

**314** - Why dont they have faces?

**Dr.** - We are trying to eliminate any emotion behind the acts today.

**314** - How do they see?

**Dr.** - One day I will explain everything, but for now please kill the first individual.

314 studies Dr. Feldmans face for a moment before walking over to the first. He stops an inch away, almost nose to nose (if it had a nose).

**314** - It isnt breathing. Strange.

314 snaps the neck and steps back. Readings are taken, compared, logged.

**Dr.** - Proceed.

314 moves in front of the next, quickly snapping the neck of one and then two.  Readings are taken, compared, logged.

**Dr.** - Proceed.

314 snaps all three necks almost too quickly to see. Readings are taken, compared, logged.

**Dr.** - Thank you, 314. Ill return once the results for this test have been analyzed. Relax and enjoy some news.

The observation window switched to television mode and news is displayed. A blurb about the President, unseasonable weather patterns, a ISIS terrorist attack at Mayo Clinic, a Yellow Fever outbreak.

-------------------

*2/9/2017  9:27AM*

Experiment four, continued  logging

**Dr.** - Have you ever fired a gun before, 314?

**314** - My doorbell used to send me into shock. You think a gun firing six inches from my ear would be pleasant for me?

**Dr.** - Of course, a silly question indeed. Six more individuals will be entering your room. One has a gun. Please take the gun and kill them all.

Readings are taken, compared, logged. Six of the faceless come in, the last holding a gun outstretched toward 314, handle out. 314 takes the gun, slides his hands over it, studies it. The first shot misses however each subsequent shot hits the target. 314 is smiling. Readings are taken, compared, logged.

**Dr.** - Excellent, thank you. How did it feel to use a gun?

**314** - Different. Powerful. Surprisingly cold, like the gun is trying to steal all of my warmth.

Six more of the faceless come in, each one grabbing a deceased test subject and carry them out. They return, the last holding a large hunting knife.

**Dr.** - Please, again, this time with the knife.

314 takes the knife and sprints from the first to the last, knife flashing out. Each drop lifeless with a slit across the throat. Readings are taken, compared, logged.

**Dr.** - Did that feel different to you? The knife?

**314** - It did. I could almost feel the heartbeat when I ran the edge across their throat, the warmth of blood on my hand.

314 glances down at his hands to find them devoid of any blood.

**Dr.** - Interesting, yes yes quite marvelous. [Slowly walks off talking to himself]

----------------------

*2/9/2017  11:15AM* 

Lunch delivered. There is also the most recent issue of Time magazine. 314 eats and reads.

----------------

*2/9/2017  4:00PM*

Experiment four, continued  logging

One of the faceless enters 314s room.

**Dr.** - Good afternoon, 314. This test will be a little different. Id like for you to kill the subject with your mind. 

**314** - My what? Mind? How the hell am I supposed to do that?

**Dr.** - I dont know, maybe you cant. But please humor me and try.

314 stares at Dr. Feldman, eyes narrowed, and then focuses attention on the Faceless. Nothing happens. Two minutes pass. Still nothing. Readings are taken, compared, logged.

**Dr.** - May I ask what you are thinking?

**314** - I am thinking this is the most retarded test Ive ever heard of.

**Dr.** - Have you truly tried to kill the subject? Focused intently just as if you had a gun or a knife in your hand.

**314** - Sure, yea. Ok. 

314 focuses on the Faceless. Eyes close. 314s vitals slow. The Faceless twitches momentarily. Then nothing. 314s brow is glistening lightly with sweat. The Faceless leaves the room. Readings are taken, compared, logged.

**Dr.** - Thank you 314. You may rest now. Dinner will be by shortly.

--------------

*2/9/2017  5:15PM*

Dinner delivered. 314 takes the dinner and sits down to eat. A man enters.

Confusion crosses 314s face momentarily, then recognition, then a smile. 

The man drops dead. He looked just like his father.

Observations from experiment one and two  logging

Patient 314 can be manipulated into submission with extreme sensory input and enhanced by the taking of life. Still unsure of the cause, whether it is life force, chemical reaction in the brain, or simply a deranged perception. If it is life force or a chemical reaction we can control it and perfect it. If 314 has created this illusion it wont be so easy to control. Maybe even impossible to control. Today we attempt to measure how much a life is worth.

--------------

*2/8/2017  6:15AM*

Experiment preparation  logging

Breakfast delivered. 314 eats in silence. Immediately following the meal another child is presented. 314 watches the child warily for several minutes, glancing at the observation window occasionally.

**314** - Who are you?

Child does not respond. 314 circles the child, then casually snaps its neck.

------------------

*2/8/2017  12:15PM*

A woman is introduced to the room. 314 does not seem to notice. 

**Dr.** - Please, 314, only a few more before this stage of testing is over. 

**314** - Why did the little girl look the same? Why are they all the same? WHAT DO YOU WANT?!

 314 pounds on the glass.

**Dr.** - Kill her.

314 spins and lunges in one fluid motion and snaps her neck cleanly.

Readings are taken, compared, logged.

Light intensity increased by 180, white noise volume 8.

*2/8/2017  2:15PM*

A woman is introduced to the room.

**314** - Who are you? 

**Woman** - I am Test 3.2. Please kill me.

**314** - Why do you want me to kill you?

**Test 3.2** - So that you can be cured.

**314** - But dont you want to live? To experience life outside of these walls?

**Test 3.2** - I live only to be killed. Please kill me.

**314** - Why do you look just like the last woman?

**Test 3.2** - Please kill me.

314 begins striking Test 3.2 in the face and chest. 314 screams in pain due to a broken bone in the hand. While clutching the hand to his chest 314 kicks Test 3.2 until she drops. He stomps repeatedly. 
An orderly and a nurse enter the room, pulling 314 away from the crushed skull to treat his hand. The body is removed and floor cleaned.

Readings are taken, compared, logged.

Light intensity increased by 180, white noise volume 6.

The final woman is introduced to the room.

**314** - Mom?

**Woman** - Oh [Removed] I thought Id never see you again. Are you ok? What is this place?

**314** - Some kind of lab or something. They are experimenting on me. I.. Ive done bad things, mom.

**Woman** - Hush now everything is alright. Mommies here. [She holds 314 close, stroking his hair]

**314** - I think I broke m..

**Dr.** - Kill her, 314. 

**314** - Wait, what? Kill my mom? No, no way! Are you kiddi..

**Dr.** - Kill her.

**Woman** - Who are you? What are you doing to my son?

**Dr.** - Kill her now.

314 is shocked with 50,000 volts. He is shaking his head, tears in his eyes. The woman is striding toward the glass. She pounds on it, then moves to the wall where she entered the room, pounding on it.

**314** - I love you, mom.

She crumples to the ground, neck broken.

Dinner is brought to 314. 

**Dr.** - Please, eat. You need your strength.

**314** - Screw you.

**Dr.** - Oh come now. I thought we were past all of that nonsense. There is only one more test today and then youll be moving on to the next phase in testing. I promise youll enjoy it much, much better. Now eat your dinner and Ill bring you your dessert soon.

314 slowly eats the food. As soon as the last bite is eaten Dr. Feldman enters the room holding a plate with a large slice of carrot cake. Dr. Feldman sits next to 314, offering him the cake. 314 begins eating. 

After two bites 314 takes the fork and jams it into the throat of Dr. Feldman. Blood spurts out all over the carrot cake and 314s face.

[Clap, clap, clap] Dr. Feldman can be seen just beyond the observation glass. 

Readings are taken, compared, logged.

The observation glass switches to television mode, displaying CCTV footage with timestamp matching the present time. The footage is of 314s home. His mother passes by one camera, emerges on another in 314s room. She sits and cries.

Dr. Feldman

*2/7/2017  6:15AM*

Experiment preparation  logging

Patient 314 receives breakfast, eating rapidly.

**Dr.** - Good morning, 314. How did you sleep?

**314** - Mind if I finish eating first? It is rude to interrupt a meal.

**Dr.** - Of course. Ill skip the pleasantries and explain what we are aiming to do here. All you need to do is listen.

314 continues eating however his eyes never break from Dr. Feldman

**Dr.** - We want to perfect your cure, 314. Right now we know only rudimentary ideas about how your disease works but that is going to change. Dr. Ramsus quite frankly didnt appreciate the opportunity he had. He squandered his chance at placing his name in the forefront of the medical community. I, however, will not let that chance get by me. Now I am going to ask you a few questions about the circumstances of your disease. All you need to do is nod yes or no.

314 has finished his meal.

**Dr.** - Any amount of sensory stimuli would cause heart palpitations and mental anguish, correct?

314 affirms.

**Dr.** - Until the car accident you had never witnessed a reversal of the condition, correct?

314 affirms.

**Dr.** - Your first experiment involved your estranged father and his new family in which you attempted to recreate the effects of the car accident, correct?

314 smiles, then affirms.

**Dr.** - Tell me about the outcome of that experiment please.

**314** - It worked, at least for a while. My experiments were interrupted so I cant be sure about any quantitative or qualitative statistics. I *believe* that a personal connection, positive or negative, enhances the experience. When I killed my father I felt much more strength flow through me than when I killed his skank or kids. Of course I also thought it could be tied directly to the size of the individual, or their vigor. Again, I was interrupted before conclusions could be made.

**Dr.** - Do not fret. Together we will pinpoint the exact range with many testing variables. Did intercourse with Vanessa give you strength or was it simply the euphoria of orgasm?

**314** - It was my first time. I have nothing to compare it to so I cant answer that. Are we almost done? Im bored.

**Dr.** - One more question: If you are never cured completely will you kill forever in order to have a normal life?

314 affirms.

**Dr.** - Wonderful, thank you for your cooperation. Your room records everything you say and do and we would like to know your thoughts throughout the process of these upcoming tests. If you say Journal Entry, start and Journal Entry, end your words will be logged separately. Lunch will be served [looks at watch] in approximately four hours. After lunch your first experiment begins.

--------------

*2/7/2017  11:00AM*

Lunch delivered. 314 eats in silence. Still no change in demeanor and monitors not detecting a heart episode yet.

----------------

*2/7/2017  12:07PM*

314 has begun to exploring his room. 314 appears to be exceptionally patient and thorough in exploration. Discovery of observation glass doubling as a television has ended the exploration. 314 is now sitting on the cot watching world news  it is the only available program.

-------------------

*2/7/2017  2:15PM*

Automatic light intensity program initiated. Television volume increased by four. 314 appears to be slightly agitated. 

------------------

*2/7/2017  3:15PM*

Light intensity increased. Television volume increased by four. 314 begins pacing, continues for two minutes, then resumes exploration of the room.

------------------

*2/7/2017  4:15PM*

Light intensity increased. Television volume increased by four. 314 is now face down on the cot, blanket draped over his head. Monitors show one small instance of heart palpitation.

--------------

*2/7/2017  5:15PM*

Light intensity increased. Television volume increased by four. Dinner is presented to 314. The sound of the metal tray sliding on the concrete floor creates a heart episode. 314 slowly makes his way to the food and eats even slower. Three more episodes occur during the meal. The last episode is stronger.

-------------

*2/7/2017  6:13PM*

314 appears to be anticipating the increases. Dr. Feldman watches his reaction and the monitors when the increases occur. A massive heart episode causes 314s body to twitch and shiver. 

Experiment 1 complete. Light intensity reduced to normal. Television off, observation window now opaque.

**Dr.** - I am sorry for the discomfort. Before any real testing could begin we had to first bring you back to a baseline. I didnt know if more sensory information would speed up the process  now we know it does. 

**314** - Screw you!

**Dr.** - Now, now, now, any good scientist knows the need and importance of a baseline. How else can we draw any real conclusions? Please, [A small child enters the room of 314] believe me when I say that we want to cure you AND understand your disease properly. Now, you know what to do.

314 launches at the small child, grabbing the hair with both hands and twisting forcefully. The child drops lifelessly to the floor. 314 stares down for a moment, then returns to his cot. 

**Dr.** - Better?

**314** - Who was she?

*2/6/2017  4:12AM*


Transfer of [REMOVED] from Mayo Research Clinic, completed.

Admittance of [REMOVED] into Ward 11, completed. 

[REMOVED] assigned to PID# 314

48 hour initial observation of 314 has begun.

*2/6/2017  9:01AM*

First contact interview between Dr. Feldman and 314  logging

Patient 314 is laying on the cot with eyes closed.

**Dr.** - I trust the flight was not too rough. How are you feeling this morning?

**314** - Screw you.

**Dr.** - Are the lights too bright? I can have them dimmed more if you prefer. 

**314** - Screw you.

**Dr.** - I see. Command, please increase lumens by eighty, thank you. Ill be back in an hour.
Patient 314 spits on the observation window and resumes laying on the cot with eyes closed.

---------------------------

*2/6/2017  10:04AM*

Follow-up interview between Dr. Feldman and 314  logging

No change in patient 314.

**Dr.** - I would like to discuss what you did to Dr. Ramsus and his colleagues. Will you please explain what caused you to act so destructively towards your doctor?

**314** - He promised to cure me fourteen years ago. I was just making sure he kept his promise.

**Dr.** - How can he keep his promise if he is dead? Are you suggesting that you are cured?

**314** - For now.

**Dr.** - Please elaborate. 

**314** - Screw you.

**Dr.** - We cant help you if you dont explain why you did what you did and what you mean by him curing you. Please, elaborate.

**314** - Do you even know what is wrong with me? 

**Dr.** - You suffer from a unique condition in which your senses overload your brain causing massive heart trauma, which has now been called [REMOVED] Disease. Additionally, you suffer from mental instability and delusion (in this case Cotard Delusion) possibly caused by a lifetime of extreme stress, mental, and physical anguish. Furthermore, you are now labeled as schizophrenic and/or bi-polar.

**314** - So, no?

**Dr.** - Lets move on for a moment and talk about what happened at the clinic. What drove you to do that to Dr. Ramsus and his staff?

**314** - Each person cured me a little longer. It isnt rocket science, doc. And you are wasting time brightening my room. Ive got a few weeks before they wear off.

**Dr.** - I suppose we will have to wait and see, wont we? Command, please increase lumens by one hundred and initiate noise program. Thank you. Ill return in an hour.


Patient 314 shows no noticeable signs of distress.

--------------------------------

*2/6/2017  11:09AM*

Second follow-up interview between Dr. Feldman and 314  logging

**Dr.** - Command, please discontinue noise program. I am going to read to you the transcript issued to us by security at the clinic. Please interrupt at any time if a detail is incorrect or if youd like to explain. Ill pause periodically to ask questions as well. [Dr. Feldman begins reading] Patient was lead to Observation Room 1 where Dr. Ramsus and twelve staff members waited to perform testing and observations based upon the recent change in physical ability. The patient sat down in the chair which was centered in the room and surrounded by equipment, monitors, and staff. Dr. Ramsus began asking several questions when the patient grabbed a scalpel and surgical drill. The patient proceeded to stab nearby staff with the scalpel while placing the drill to the head of Dr. Ramsus and 

**314** - I had already drilled through his eye before I ever stabbed a staff member.

**Dr.** - Noted. Patient then threw scalpels and other surgical items at staff while chasing down each one with the drill. The room was put on lockdown while security rushed to the scene. At one point two nurses tackled the patient from behind however the patient bit and ripped out the throat of one nurse while jamming the drill into the stomach of the other. By the time security could get a Taser on the patient Dr. Ramsus and ten of his staff were dead. The remaining two were critically injured and died in transit to Surgery. [Dr. Feldman looks up from his clipboard] Before this incidence you could not even leave your room without extreme cardiac distress. How were you able to murder thirteen people within 90 seconds?

**314** - When they lose their life I gain mine. 

**Dr.** - So you are saying that you steal their life force?

**314** - I have no idea how it works. I just know that when I cause their death my issues fade.

**Dr.** - Hmm.. Is this fading permanent or temporary?

**314** - Well Im not sure. My experiments were interrupted.

**Dr.** - Dont worry, we will get to the bottom of your disease together. How did you discover this phenomenon?

**314** - By accident, really. I caused a massive car accident a while ago. Immediately I felt different. From there I began my experiments and here I am.

**Dr.** - Was your father and his family part of your experiments?

**314** - Yes.

**Dr.** - Thank you. Your lunch will be brought to you shortly. Ill be back this evening to discuss your daily schedule of testing. Get some rest. Command, please reduce lumens by one hundred and eighty. Thank you.

My mother was astonished when she came home. The entire house was clean, sparkling. Every curtain was drawn back to let in the bright sunlight. It had been so long since this house was brightened by anything other than incandescent bulbs. Dinner was laid out on the table for her and I to enjoy. She walked over to me weeping joyful tears. 

*Hunnie, what is all of this? Are you.. are you.. better?*

*I just woke up and felt different. Momma, Im cured.* Of course I couldnt tell her the truth.

*Oh sweetie, oh my baby!* She stood behind my chair, hugging me tight and covering my head in tears.

We ate together, her staring at me between bites, still unable to comprehend the sudden and drastic change in me. It was so nice to see her smile again. She has a pretty smile. I offered to clear the table and wash the dishes but she had a better idea. We hopped in the car and went for ice cream! This was the first time I had ridden in a car that wasnt heading toward a hospital. I ordered a PB Blizzard Blast, extra-large, and she bought a waffle cone with two scoops of butter pecan. Do you remember the first time you ate ice cream? Do you remember the cold filling your mouth and stinging your teeth a little but immediately washing away with wonderful flavors dancing along your tongue? I do.

I made my momma promise not to say anything to anyone yet, not even my doctors. The next morning was my scheduled in-home visit and I wanted them to see it for themselves when they came. We stayed up late playing card games and watching classic movies that I had missed out on. I was starting to wear down a little bit after the third movie. Maybe it was because it was so late but I didnt want to chance it. 

*Momma, Im going to go the bed. I cant keep my eyes open anymore.*

She kissed my forehead - *Ok, sweetie, good night.*

----------------

I woke up the next morning refreshed but still a little worn down. I was unsure of whether the effects were not permanent or if I just pushed myself too far with my new found lifestyle but I would find out soon enough. I laid in bed for a while contemplating this when a wonderful smell made its way into my nostrils. I got dressed and was greeted with omelets and coffee. How could I have never enjoyed coffee before? Seriously, it is amazing. My first sip hit me the way Mario must feel whenever he gets a mushroom or power-up. Dark, rich, and hot. My mouth burned but I didnt care  I let it sit on my tongue for a while just savoring it. I drank three cups along with my eggs and a slice of toast while waiting for Dr. Ramsus to show up. 

He was shocked to say the least when I answered the door on my own two feet with no signs of heart agitation. I led him into the kitchen and pulled out his chair, offering him some coffee.

*No, thanks. Coffee and I dont mix. I suppose I dont know what to say. When did this change occur?*

*I woke up yesterday morning feeling different. I suppose strength would be the right word, I felt strength in my body.*

*Can you describe what you feel? What differences you perceive?*

He asked me a lot of questions that I did my best to answer and then took a few blood samples to take back to the lab for testing. He also did a quick physical  listened to my chest, blood pressure, looked in my mouth and ears. When I led him to the front door we shook hands and he promised to get in contact with me as soon as he had a look at my test results. I thanked him and he left. 

I figured I had two days before he would want me to come in for more extensive testing so I began to plan. I still felt a little weak, although eating a big meal helped some, and an excessively loud action scene in a movie I was watching set my heart off to the races so I knew I wasnt cured completely. I would need more deserving [helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5px61m/helpers/).

It was a nice day and I wanted to enjoy the sun on my skin so I went for a walk thru the neighborhood. Kids were out playing, the mailman tending his route, and a woman dog-walker trying to keep control of the ten or so dogs she had out in front of her. She was on the same side of the street as I was and I caught up to her pretty quickly, seeing how her dogs kept taking off in different directions. As I passed I recognized her  a friend of my older sister  and a constant source of teasing when I was younger. My, my, my she had matured nicely.  She did a double-take when she saw me. We chatted for a bit while we walked and I explained the miraculous change. She was majoring in human anatomy at the local university so she was **very** interested in the whole thing. I invited her over later that night to talk more about it and she agreed. I watched her butt sway back and forth as she walked away down another street. 

-------------

Vanessa rang the bell (something I used to despise hearing) and I let her in. She was gorgeous, radiant. Her hair flowed easily around her shoulders and neck and her eyes twinkled whenever she smiled. She was wearing yoga pants and a loose, flowy shirt that looked like it was 80s fashion. I led her to my room and we sat across from each other on my bed. She asked me all kinds of questions and it was a lot of fun making up the answers. Instead of answering one of her questions I leaned in and quickly kissed her on the lips. It was my first kiss! I knew I didnt have anything to lose so why know, you know? She was kind of startled by it but she kissed me back. Oh it was heavenly. What a day! My first taste of coffee, my first kiss, and later, my first orgasm. Ill spare you the details but I am sure you can remember the first time you experienced it. What a rush! I am not sure if I enjoyed having sex with her or killing her more but both were incredibly satisfying. 

--------------

The next day I got a job walking dogs (because clearly Vanessa no longer could) and I used the opportunity to learn my neighborhood better. Who lived where, who had pets, kids, etc. One of the dogs was especially unruly and disobedient so I decided he would be my test subject of the evening. Late that night I snuck into the backyard where the dog lived and found my new helper snoozing. We did some experiments and then I went home, a huge smile on my face. It was great to know that animals could give me strength, too, although not quite as much. Armed with new knowledge about my disease I laid out my plan for Dr. Ramsus and the others that have failed me thus far in my life.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I always thought my family was crazy. Family members disappearing, a curse on us or our house or our land, murderous ancestors doing whatever it took to keep things quiet. That is why I changed my name and moved as far away as I could. I was tired of the stares, the murmurs, and people crossing the street so that they wouldnt be on the same side as me. It wasnt me they were afraid of per se, but my last name. One word that tied me to a bunch of lunatics who instilled fear and hatred. 

From what I could piece together it started about two hundred years ago when my family first moved into the area. They were builders, not farmers, and they wanted a fresh start. I think a lot of people did back then. So they moved south to a settlement that was just coming to life in the hopes of helping create a solid future. And things went well, for a while. They built a town hall, church, courthouse, jail, saloon, and pharmacy. It was beautiful, and no other town had anything like it for miles and miles, so people started coming to stay. Soon families and even whole towns were moving in to this bright and beautiful paradise. Ive seen drawings and pictures  it truly was ahead of its time as far as design and architecture. 

Once everything was well established my family started putting their efforts into building their own home. By this time the patriarch of the family was mayor and so he decided a mayoral mansion should be built on a wooded hill overlooking the city square. Not only was it beautiful land but very defensible. Two sides were high cliff faces and the other two were heavily wooded with the river (and city water supply) cutting across. The only way to approach the home easily was across a wide drawbridge that was flanked by two short guard towers. My family is from Ireland but youd be able to guess that if you saw the mansion. It was modeled very much like an Irish stronghold. I never understood why they felt it was necessary to be able to withstand a full-scale military attack but I do now.

Fast forward to my youth  I am seven or eight years old, an only child and one of seventeen young children living in the family estate. It was great fun then. Innocent and pure. No knowledge of my family history. We kept mostly to the estate grounds (we were told it was to keep us safe but in fact it was to keep us isolated and unaware of the hatred now extended to our family) and that didnt bother us. There was plenty to do and explore and have fun with. I went hunting and fishing, learned to ride horses, tended a small vegetable garden, and did lots of rambunctious kid things. 

One day all the kids decided to play hide and seek and I was excited because I was finally allowed to play it with them. Everyone seemed to know of a good hiding spot already but since I hadnt played before I was a bit clueless. I took off running and could hear the counter getting closer to zero but still no hiding spot. Just before time ran out I darted sideways down another hallway, then another and another, and scrambled up the steps of a narrow stone staircase. It wasnt a great spot but at least it was pretty far away. Maybe Id get lucky. I climbed onto the bannister and crouched behind the statue that sat atop it, hoping I was narrow enough to not be seen from the base of the stairs. Once my breathing slowed and my initial excitement wore off I started to look around at where I was and listen for incoming steps. There was no door at the top of the steps which I thought was weird and the stone was very different from anything else I had seen around the mansion but my young mind didnt think too much of these things. I wish I had. 

After a few minutes of waiting and hearing no one around I got bored and made my way back to home base to see if I won the game. As soon as I turned the corner of the last hallway I walked right into my mother. She grabbed me, crying and yelling, scolding me but kissing my face all over somehow all at the same time. 

*Whats wrong, mom?*

*What do you mean, Whats wrong? Youve been gone for three days! WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?!*

She broke out into huge sobs while hugging me tighter than any other time I can remember. Needless to say that was the last time I was allowed to play hide and seek. I couldnt explain it, didnt really understand the implications at the time. I was young and it was easily forgettable I suppose. Looking back on it now I dont see how I could have ever disbelieved all of the stories and legends about my family. Apparently on several different occasions kids have gone missing in our estate never to be seen again. It first happened right after the mansion was built. One of the grandkids had friends over and they went hunting for rabbits but none ever came back. The only thing they ever found was a shoe with the foot still in it. Another time the entire town came for the annual costume ball. Sometime during the event an amorous couple wandered off to have some fun but never came back. The town suspected foul play because the man was a favorite in the upcoming election and both were from prominent families. Not sure what happened but it looks like people were silenced or killed to keep things status quo.

Like I said, I didnt pay too much attention to the stories. I hated living cooped up on the estate, I hated the looks cast at me when I did manage to go to town. I am not sure if it was the death of my father or reading the U.S. Forest Service stories that jogged my memory but the stone staircase jumped to the front of my mind. I cant seem to get it out, actually, which is why I am even sharing this with you. My father was the youngest sibling and the last surviving member until now, which leaves me as the sole heir to the estate. I think it is time I investigate these stories. My plane is boarding so I will conclude this for now. Ill post an update when I have some answers.

<TEXT> My wife and I had our first child (now almost eleven months old) and we received about $600 in cash at baby showers for her. We decided to save it for her instead of using it on items and opened a savings account. I'm trying to find the best investment to use it in for her. We found a 48 month,  1.8% CD we could put it in but is that our best option? Any advice would be much appreciated!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5r2pm4/they_want_you_to_think_you_are_safe/)

Woke up this morning feeling exceptionally refreshed considering the situation I have found myself in. It is amazingly quiet in this house. Although my house is in a tiny stretch of homes on the far end of town I still have some pretty noisy neighbors. I bought my house out here, far from pretty much everything, for the peace and quiet. Of course I couldnt find that, usually keeping me up with their extremely annoying Mexican music blasting from their backyard patio or drunken fights after the music is finally turned off but I didnt hear them once last night. In fact, I dont recall hearing anything at all. A siren blaring or kids playing or the family of birds that live in the nearest tree. After a few minutes in bed thinking about this revelation and what exactly I was going to do financially I dragged myself out and found my way to the new, ultra-modern kitchen to get some coffee. Normally this could be done with my eyes closed, still half-asleep but with an entirely new layout to the kitchen (whole house, really) I needed my head up, eyes opened, and that is when I took my first look out the kitchen window.

The sun was just peeking up over the house next door. Odd, considering my neighbor on that side is on a downslope and usually I could see right over their roof. I rubbed my eyes and tried to knock out all of the sleep from my mind before looking again. Yes, it was not the same house. Walking over to the small bay window I took in a startling sight  every house was different. Every house that I could see was a NoSleep house! 

I ran to the front door and fumbled with all of the new, huge deadbolts, pressing my palm to the door to finally open it to the brisk morning air. Pulling my robe a little tighter around my body I stepped out and gasped. The entire neighborhood, *OVERNIGHT*, had changed. How could that even be possible? I couldnt even hear the salesman standing right next to me over the machinery being used to take care of my home yesterday yet I didnt hear a single thing from inside my home. I had to be dreaming. Nightmaring. A few others were stepping out into the morning sun on their new porches to survey the changes as well, one waving when she saw me. I waved back and began walking over.

*Morning! What a surprise, eh?*

*Yeah, hey thanks for the referral. We got a huge discount because of it.*

*Uh, yeah, sure. So you called the number on the flier as well?*

*Flier, what flier? We saw that salesman talking to you and asked him what was going on once you went back to work. He explained the situation providing protection against the fracking earthquakes, tornadoes, and other natural disasters we get so often around here. Plus being in a flood plain and all that. We never would have known if you didnt take the initiative and have them come out.*

*Yeah, great. Glad to help Hey I gotta get ready for work so Ill see you around.*

She called out a good-bye to my back as I made my way inside and shut the door. My mind was swimming and my stomach growling. I tried to reason things out over breakfast but nothing really made sense. Why did that guy lie to everyone about the houses? Taking out the business card and rotating it a few times in my hands  why the hell is this thing blank?

*Abra kadabra POOF!... Open Sesame!... Bazinga!... Be revealed*

Well that didnt work. I guess it isnt voice-activated like everything else in the house. I finished up my breakfast and got ready for work. 

-----------------------


Not very productive today. Who could be? All I am thinking about is the crazy new sub-division I am living in. At least I hadnt seen any of the cars parked out front but they could be in the garages. How much money did we just get suckered into giving away? A phone call from a client would snap me out of my revere from time to time but mostly alternated between checking the clock and pondering the implications of my new situation and how I would get out of it. 

**RING RING RING** It was the number I called to order the house. The disconnected number.

*Hello?*

An automated message spoke back - *Please return home, there has been an emergency. Your employee has been notified of your absence. Good bye.* 

As soon as the line went dead my boss knocked on my glass door and stepped in. He asked if everything was alright and I just shrugged, probably looking confused and a little scared. *Just call when you get it all cleared up and let me know if I can help with anything* he said. What else could I do? I went home.

Something was clearly wrong the moment I turned off of the highway and made the left-hand turn onto my street. Was it darker somehow? It felt darker. There were no clouds passing overhead. It was darker, and quiet. Not that I am usually home at 2 PM but I figured at least a few kids would be running around or the retired guy down the street would be out making his perfect lawn slightly more perfect. I eased up on the accelerator and cruised past each new, solid, powerful fortress of a home looking for any kind of movement or hint of life. Every shutter was drawn. On every home. Except mine of course. My garage door glided up just seconds before my front bumper collided with it and closed seconds after my rear bumper cleared the threshold.

I sprinted through the house and over to my control chair, hitting the lock-down button and watched as each door and window went through a series of changes. Secondary barriers slid into place, thick steel shutters slammed shut, a gentle whirring of locking mechanisms all around me. Within thirty seconds it was done and silence filled the room. I turned on the TV and changed the input to show the surveillance footage while I poured myself a drink. I still dont understand why I was following this insanity. An emergency? What emergency? How did they get me out of work? Why did my boss even take them seriously? I called in sick a few months ago and had to jump through flaming hoops just to get it approved as an absence. 

I got up and poured myself another drink and decided to at least enjoy this extra time as best as I could. Drink in hand, recliner kicked way back, 75 inches of 4K resolution the only light in the room. I watched. And I slept.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like most of you in this sub I have had strange situations in my life. Unexplained, frightening, paranormal even. And like you I search here for answers. A few days ago a flier was left on my door, rubber banded on just like a new Chinese restaurant menu or church worship service begging for new attendants. I didnt think much of it and tossed it down with the rest of the mail I grabbed on my way in my home from work. I kicked off my boots, put away my lunch bag, unloaded my pockets of keys, wallet, phone, Chap Stick, work badge and changed into my lounge-wear. Once settled in my favorite chair I leaned over and grabbed the stack of mail, already having forgotten the flier. Bills, bills, junk mail, illegible letter from my grandmother, bills, and lastly the flier.

I dug through it all, made a halfhearted attempt at deciphering what my grandmother was trying to tell me, double-checked the amounts of the auto-payed bills before ripping them up and then pulled the rubber band off of the flier (I LOVE Chinese food). What I saw shocked me and I just sat there, staring, not really reading but just staring for a moment. It was an ad for homes, cars, and what appeared to be an all-in-one phone defense system tailor-made to secure a person from the spooks and haunts of r/NoSleep.

After reading over it a few times I laughed and called the number on the bottom, thinking it would be a hoax, and was even more shocked when a pleasant-voiced woman greeted me. *Welcome to NoSleep, Inc.* she said. *Would you like to place an order?* I stammered for a second and hung up.

Now I understand that we are supposed to suspend all disbelief, every story is true, and I am sure that most are. But there are some that just couldnt be, right? I try and try but my skeptical nature wont allow it every time so of course I called the number expecting a joke recording about how dumb I was for calling the number or whatever. Now I was intrigued, excited, but still very skeptical. I called back. A different person answered this time with the same greeting. Again I was shocked. I was expecting the same kindly voice of the first woman. I asked a few questions about the house and how much it was, playing along with the guy on the other end of the line. Damn this thing was pricey... but what do you expect when it is made up of things youve never end heard of before. Still, it sounded silly and, although elaborate, very much a hoax. So I did what anyone would do, I ordered a house.

I was too stupid to take a picture but I did transcribe the flier and post it online the next day because I knew you would all get a kick out of it, maybe even get a message from the creator asking for feedback or something. It was removed. Quickly. I did get it posted to another area so you could see it  [enjoy.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongsleep/comments/5qj9q9/nosleep_inc/) Now fast forward to today when I get a call at work from my neighbor asking me why my current house is being bulldozed. What. The. Actual. Fuck. Took my lunch break to drive home only to see I had no home. Just a massive pile of timber, shingles, and crap heaping up towards the sky where my home used to be. Machine equipment everywhere and parked down the street is a semi with a huge house on a special trailer. As I made my way toward the closest man in an orange vest a car pulled up next to me, a VERY nice car that kind of looked like a Lexus, and a suit got out. In his hand was my invoice. 

---------------------------------------------------

I am now sitting in my new living room in my new chair trying to figure out what the hell just happened. Somehow within twelve hours my house was completely demolished, hauled off, land cleared and leveled, and a new house placed. I tried to call the number again but it was disconnected. Attached to my invoice was a blank business card and I am playing with it now as I type this out. Sometimes it feels smooth and sometimes I can feel indents in it but I cant seem to get those indents to become visible. Ill keep you updated on any progress I make. 

At least the chair is comfy..

I knew I should feel horrible. I should be full of remorse and regret and guilt for being the cause of such a terrible accident. But I didnt. I felt alive! I felt genuine happiness. For the first time I was able to enjoy the sensations of life without pain or anxiety. I heard things without repercussion, felt the air ruffle my hair, and watched a bird land outside my bedroom window (which was open for the first time ever). Although it didnt last very long it was the greatest few hours Id ever had and I needed it back. Over the course of the next twenty four hours I tested the effects the car accident had on me. 

* For three hours only extreme sensations caused me to die

* The remaining twenty one hours slowly tapered back to a more normal response from my body, however I noticed slightly less sensitivity by the end of the day
What caused it? Was it an overload of information? The massive amount of heat, burning flesh, screeching tires and crunching metal, BOOM of the engine and screams of those inside and those running to douse the flames, the sirens of eight emergency vehicles coming on the scene? I couldnt say for sure but I was about to find out. 

I had never seen my father in person, just a few old pictures my mom kept for some reason. He had been in contact a few times to try and visit, make himself feel better about leaving us. Last time he called was about a year ago and he really wanted me to meet his new wife and kids. Yea sure Id love to meet the family that was good enough for you. But that was then, and this is now. Now I had a reason to see him - *Look at me, dad, Im better! You can finally teach me how to play catch.*

**Me** *Hey, uh, dad?*

**Him** *wow.. I cant believe you are calling here. Is everything ok?* I could practically see the tears welling up at the corners of his eyes.

**Me** *Yea yea everything is fine, dad, more than fine. I am better! I can do things like go outside now.*

**Him** *How, how is that possible? What did the doctors say?*

**Me** *It is easier if I just showed you. Want to bring Vikki and the kids over tomorrow for lunch? Ill make something for us.*

**Him** *Yea, of course, lunch. Ill take the day off of work and bring everyone by. We just got a puppy, Pickle. Want me to bring him, too?* The tremble is his voice was almost too much for me to take. He was just so happy.

**Me** *Sure cant wait to see you, dad.*

With that I hung up the phone and slowly made my way through the house, getting it ready for them tomorrow. Mom would be home soon from work and I had a lot of work to do. I wanted everything to be perfect for my first visit with my dad.

I had to get up at 5AM to ensure that the house was ready and lunch made in time for their visit but I made it just in time. Just as I laid out the last fork I heard a knock at the door. My heart was racing and I wasnt even being effected by any outside stimulus. I was nervous, excited, ready. Pausing at the door for a minute to regain my composure and let my heart settle down I slowly opened the door and let them in. All the excitement of five kids and a puppy hit me hard and I had to catch my breath after several deaths all in a row. Dad looked at me with sad eyes, knowing what pain and agony I just went through and realizing that I wasnt actually cured of anything. 

*Dont worry dad. It isnt as bad as it used to be and I am in the middle of an experiment that relieves my condition. Ill show you.*

Once they were all in I ushered them over to the table and they took their seats. I asked dad to say Grace and then we dug in to some delicious pancakes and eggs (It is all I really know how to make). Halfway through my second pancake I reached out and grabbed the knife for some more butter but instead plunged it deep into my fathers neck. The cold metal and warm blood would normally send my body into spasms and my heart would race, stop, race, stop. But not this time. I felt strength and a calming of my nerves just like the after the accident. His new wife screamed at the top of her lungs and tried to get up but only succeeded in crashing into one of her brats. I pulled the knife out of his neck with blood pumping out all over my arm and moved slowly around the table to his wife as she scrambled to get away. Kicking her in the face once, twice, then bending down and ramming the knife into her pleading eyes with all my force. She stopped moving immediately. Pickle was barking and whining, going from snapping its teeth at me and licking the blood off of the ground.

I turned, aglow with renewed vigor and life, towards the closest child. We had a huge bottle of extra strength superglue that I had coated the chairs with just before they arrived and it was doing its job. I reached out and snapped the neck of the closest and sprang away down the hall after the oldest. Her legs were long enough to reach the ground from a sitting position and she ran, hunched over towards the front door. I caught her by the hair and flung her backwards. She landed on her back, face covered in tears, mouth split wide in a scream. I stuffed the knife straight down her throat until I felt it connect with the vertebrae. Running back (amazing how trivial this seems to most but it was my first time doing so) to the last of them I made their cries stop quickly. Pickle was last. I honestly didnt know if an animal life would benefit me or not and I am still not quite sure. I was so high, so full of their life essence that I couldnt tell one way or the other. 

My body was strong, agile, not a single sensation caused my heart to race or stop. My experiment was a success!

I spent the rest of the afternoon cleaning up the mess and enjoying my new found freedoms. It wasnt until the next morning when I had my first relapse, which was minor in comparison to what it used to be, and even now as I type this with my actual hands I have yet to fall back into the state I once was. It is possible that either the violence of the death or the close connection I had to the persons dying caused it to be that much more medicinal. Of course, I have much more experimenting to do before I know whether it is permanently cured or not. Fortunately I have many [doctors who can help me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5rvtzd/my_doctor_is_the_cure/)

<TEXT> Have you ever wondered what it feels like to die? Is it painful when your body lets go of its last stores of energy? Are you aware that you are dying or do you think it will pass? Maybe you are one of the many that have thought it great to never be *able* to die. Like a superhero. Saving beautiful women from horrible men and little children from burning houses. Oh yes, that would be nice.

Now lets imagine you are walking up some stairs. The damned elevator is broken again and you have to trudge up five flights to get to your office building. Step up, step up, step up. After two flights you are a little winded perhaps, maybe you take your phone out and check e-mails to save time. That is when your foot catches the stop of a riser and for a split second you panic. Your heart races, your blood flowing fiercely through your body which causes your body temperature rises significantly and you break out into a sweat. In the next moment your foot finds the step and your panic recedes although you feel a little sheepish and hope no one witnessed the miscue. A few stairs later and your face is no longer flushed with the excess blood, your heart has returned to a normal rhythm, and all is right with the world. You may tread a little more carefully for the next minute or so, maybe even putting your phone back into your pocket or purse, and you forget about that moment in time.

These are all normal responses for a normal human being. Your body senses danger, your balance is thrown off and your mind knows the great distance you could fall should you go backwards. All normal. But what if I told you that **everything** caused your body to react that way. Every properly executed step. Every change in the winds direction. Every noise your ears perceive and every flash of color taken in by your retinas. What if your body could not differential between normal interactions with the world around you and emergency situations? I suppose, then, you would be me. 

My mother told me once that all I ever did was cry for the first few years of life. She couldnt understand it, the doctors couldnt understand it. Pain, the doctors told her. He is always in pain. There was nothing they could do because they couldnt find the cause. The only indication they had was my heart  it constantly revved up like I was in pain and then stopped very briefly before resuming a normal beat. She had raised four children already and knew exactly what each needed based on their cry, except for mine. It didnt take long for her to stop taking me places and pretty soon I was left alone in a dark room with the door closed and a primitive baby monitor keeping me company. 

I was small and weak, physically and mentally. Going outside for even a moment was enough to send me into shock. But I survived. I kept on going. As I grew up and my capacity for communication increased I was able to relate more of what I was going through with my mother and doctors. Unfortunately it was far too late for any real help or hope. The debt of constant hospital visits and specialists crippled my mother. My father only lasted a few weeks before giving up and leaving us. I told my mom to stop looking for a cure and focus on my brothers and sister, and thankfully she did.

I spent the next fifteen years by myself for the most part, except for those my laptop connected me to. School was out of the question so I enrolled in online learning that was an at-your-own-pace style. It was hard considering just touching the mouse or clacking on the keyboard sent my heart racing and stopping suddenly, mind crashing into mental walls of anguish and blinding light overtaking all of my senses. It is hard to describe but it was as if I tasted more than I could handle, heard more than I could process, smell so much I became clogged, felt every molecule colliding with my body, see so clearly the spectrum of visible light separated for me for a split second. It was so overwhelming every time. But I kept going. I survived. The episodes slowly grew worse, longer, harder to handle. I had to do something but I no longer had doctor visits or specialists calling the house or coming by to see if they could figure things out. I was on my own armed with the internet and a determination to prevail. 

Fast forward to today as I speak this aloud for my computer to transcribe. I have my answer, my cure. Death. As you are probably aware there is some very taboo stuff on the internet and as a person who literally spends his every waking moment online I have stumbled across a lot of it. I began studying death more deeply some time ago and it intrigued me. Something about it seemed so familiar but I wasnt sure why. I studied what death was, how people died, what religions thought about it, what people with near-death experiences describe. It slowly became clear to me that I was dying. With every touch, sound, blink of an eye I died. And came back. Again and again and again. Eventually my heart wont be able to take the constant trauma and I will die for good unless I can find enough *helpers*.

As I said I found a cure, but it isnt an easy one to obtain and I happened upon it by accident. Yesterday I was determined to make another attempt at outside for research and to see the world. This would make my fourth visit that I can remember to the world outside of my home. Wearing special sunglasses that block out almost all of the light and noise-cancelling headphones I took it very slow, my powerchair cruising at the slowest speed. I had died twelve times by the time I made it to the end of my driveway. Glancing up ever so slightly to one side and the next I made sure the road was clear and began the slow crossing. As I crossed the yellow line in the middle of the road I heard the loudest sound Id ever witnessed, dying for twentieth time. When I came back to myself I could feel the heat of the car crash a ways down the road, hear the screams of those inside the car and those running to help. I died nine more times trying to get away as fast as I could before the car exploded. 

Seven people died that day because of me. Four in the car and three who attempted to rescue them from the car before it blew. I could feel the blast on my neck as I powered away at a brisk 3 miles per hour. But I didnt die. Not that time. In fact I made it all the way back inside my home before I succumbed to another instance of my malady, caused by the high-pitched sirens of emergency vehicles arriving on the scene. 

I was filled with fear, filled with hope. It was time to [experiment..](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5px61m/helpers/)

I am writing this from my prison cell, formerly my office. Not quite sure why I still have access to a computer or anything really but I am assuming it is because in a short time Ill be lowered back down into the chamber for another go at fixing me and they figured it will be a successful conversion. This isnt the way that I had planned to fix things. Nor is it the way I hoped to die. But die I surely will.

I will try to clear up any confusion or missing details that I have purposefully (in case someone from the hospital found these posts online) left out of my other reports in case my plan doesnt work and you need to finish what I started. From what I can gather it looks like this hospital was founded with a very strict, special set of goals in order to promote health. Their mission statement and vision is to be lifelong partners for a healthier future. That sounds amazing, awesome. Thank you for caring so much! Unfortunately, the founders were a bit crazy and took *lifelong* a bit too far. I also dont think I agree with their definition of *healthier* either. As far as I can tell I am housing the memories and abilities of every single Shane that has worked there before me. The same goes for everyone else here with their originally hired employee. Looking back through the records of all the employees (yes, I broke in to HR one night) there are very few people that were hired with different names than the first employee. I am guessing that it makes it much easier to convert them without them knowing what is going on. I was one of only twenty nine total employees that did not have the same name already as the previous person. The most likely cause of this is that you just cant find a lot of Biomed Technicians so they have to take what they can get. The other instances of miss-matched names were positions like mine that werent very mainstream or common. 
	
Now you might be saying, OK, sure that is weird but it isnt really that bad right? Well, yes and no. It is great to be gifted with decades of knowledge and ability that you didnt have to learn. BUT having your family and friends killed and removed from existence is pretty awful and that is just what was happening. You cant have a person one day be Aaron and the next day be Shane without outside people growing suspicious. And that is why I have to stop them. 

As I said I had access to virtually every room in the hospital and now I am privy to lots of knowledge that I never used to have. Using that knowledge, I roamed the hospital looking for the ingredients I would need and took them home in my lunch bag so I didnt arouse suspicion. Over the past week I built a very powerful bomb in case I couldnt find a way to reverse what was happening here on an individual basis. I didnt know that the therapist would be connected to the hospital but I didnt want to take any chances so I swallowed the bomb before going to the appointment. On my phone I have a universal remote app that I programmed the bomb timer to. Ill activate it once I know for sure I am on my way to the chamber. My hope is that the bomb will be powerful enough to take out the chamber and whatever mechanisms/technologies are at play deep in that floor. In doing so maybe everyone will snap out of whatever trance this is. 

Please keep an eye out on the news for any bombings at a hospital or any weird circumstances. Dont let this continue..

I am sitting in bed with every light out, curtains drawn tight, and my phone screen as dim as it will go while still being visible in an attempt to ease the pounding in my head. I know I cant write it all down, there was just too much, but I will try to recount as best as I can the experience I had at the therapists office last evening. I did not expect to get in on the same day that I called the office but the doctor had a large block of time available so I took it. There must be a lull in the crazy people in my area right now. Dr. Tzilcammo was not a local, didnt even attend a college in this country, and had zero ties to my company. That is why I picked him in the first place. The second reason was because he specialized in dream interpretation and hypnotism. Most of his clients are soldiers with severe PTSD (there is a major military base nearby) and other similar mental situations. 

Fast forward to me lying down onto the couch and getting into the swing of things with the doc, I didnt give any background information or reasons why, just that I felt like I had amnesia or some kind of block on a large portion of my memories and I needed to free them. He asked a few questions, trying to probe into the situation but I didnt give him much. I dont recall what happened after that but I am assuming it was watching a pendant swing back and forth or counting down from a number and snapping of fingers. What I do know is that one minute I am lying down in his office and then I am not. I will do my best to describe what I saw and felt:

*I am at work, laying down on the floor of the workshop in the middle of a repair on what looks like VERY old equipment. As I am working I notice that my hands look different. Bigger. Wedding ring on the left hand. Nails jagged and dirty. My body looks different as well. A bit of a beer gut, strange clothing Id never wear, and from what I can tell at least a foot shorter than I am. What the hell is going on?*

***Shane, how much longer on that Zoll defib?***
*I found myself responding back although in a husky, old voice:* ***Eh, dont know bub. Looks like the paddle is busted.***

 **BAM**

*I am transported to a familiar hallway, walking from the shop to the warehouse where the door is  where I ceased to be. This body is extremely tall and lean, stickly and awkward. I duck to make it through the doorway and find myself toward the back of the pack. I am witnessing a burial (that is what I am calling it when someone gets lowered into that chamber). I dont recognize anyone in the room but I recognize the process very well.*

**BAM**

*Another body, this time recognizable. It is Shanes body. The man I replaced. The man I am now. He is talking to my boss about a new job opportunity that just opened up closer to home. He/I seem so excited. My boss does not.*

***What do you mean, another job, Shane? Dont you like it here at LMH?***

***Oh yea I mean it is great and all, but it is such a long drive. I barely see my kids you know?*** *(Shit, he had a family! I didnt see any of that on Facebook..)*

***I know but youll never find a better job than here, Shane. We are a family here. We are the best.***

**BAM**

*I am back in my body. My shoulders, now my waist is breaking through from the watery hole. The door that I am standing on finishes its ascent with a soft thud and the chains are removed from my wrists.*
***Welcome back, Shane***

The doctor brought me out of the trance, my eyes fluttering open but squeezing shut once again. Even in a dim therapy office at dusk the light was too much for my eyes. They watered and burned. When was this migraine going to go away? It was pulsing behind each eye and burning down my neck. I struggled to get into a sitting position and found my body and the couch drenched in sweat. Cracking my eyes open I sought out the doctor.

*So, did I say anything?* I asked.

*Oh yes. Yes, you said quite a bit. I dare say you said too much, Aaron.*

Through the watering eyes and the pain shooting out of them I didnt see it at first. Dr. Tzilcammo had a small pistol pointed at my chest.

*I am going to give you a piece of my mind* 

*It is on the tip of my tongue*

*In the back of my mind*

Expressions that we use often but take for granted. At least I know I did, until now. I am still struggling with it all but things are becoming a little clearer. A little more focused. Someone has taken a piece of my mind and I want it back.

I wear glasses normally, not because I need them for every situation but it helps my eyes to focus. I have a strange condition where one eye is near-sighted and one eye is far-sighted. Without glasses my brain allows one eye to take over depending on the situation, which is great because it means I can always see, however it also means that during that time my other eye is unfocused and therefore slowly weakening. As with any muscle you must continue to use it in order for it to be strong and agile. Thus my need for glasses. They dont help me see much better but they help me focus both eyes at the same time and keep them strong. I bring this up only because of a comment that was made about light bending /u/AlphonseLermontant. I believe that my rare condition is the reason I am stuck somewhere in between my true self and my fake self, the person they want me to be. 

In order to test this theory I pretended to lose my glasses and borrowed a pair from a coworker while trying to read the cafeteria menu. Of course I couldnt see well from her pair (she is quite old and had a VERY strong prescription) but I did steal a glance at my badge while feigning to decipher the daily special. It was blurry and I was seeing in triplicate BUT I could make out two letters. R and O. My heart fluttered and my stomach filled with butterflies. It was true what you all had said. My badge didnt say Shane but Aaron. I must have let out more excitement than I wanted to because a few people around me looked over at me in a funny way like I was crazy for being that happy about tomato bisque with rye toast. Briskly walking out without even ordering food I went off to one of my hiding spots that I know about but cant remember how I know about it to contemplate this new discovery. Thinking is very hard to do at the moment. I have a massive migraine, my eyes burn from a lack of sleep, my brain feels split in two. Ever play charades or Catch Phrase and you KNOW what the person is trying to get you to say but you just cant find the right word. It is on the tip of your tongue but it just wont leap off. That is what I feel with every memory I try to bring up.

I lost track of time in that closet. Maybe I fell asleep, maybe I didnt, I am not sure. My boss found me as I was walking out and got on me about my production the last few days. Blah blah blah. I told her I wasnt feeling well and that I was sorry. Id get some rest and double my efforts tomorrow, promise. Of course I had no desire to do either but she didnt have to know that. I probably wouldnt be working here much longer anyway. On my way home, and I use that term very loosely, I stopped by a Target and faked my way into another prescription. I think that whole *Is this better.. or this* is a bunch of bullcrap anyway so I just answered as willy-nilly as I could while still being able to see clearly enough. With a new pair of cheap glasses in hand I searched my place for any clues or changes that I could not decipher before. I found a couple, always regarding my name. I am fairly confident now that my theory was correct and at least one part of it is fixed: they did something to my brain to **make me see certain things differently**. Obviously they planted new memories and other things into my head as well as altering my old memories to fit what they wanted and I dont know how I can fix that but at least I know about it. 

They say that knowing is half the battle so that is something, right? I spent the rest of the night trying to force my way into those memories, the real ones. They are there, way in the back, muffled and blurry. I am trapped somewhere between everything being on the tip of my tongue and being in the back of my mind. 

I am going to see a therapist about being hypnotized so that they can help me unlock those memories, kind of like repressed memories. That always works in the movies, right? Ill report back with anything I may find out after my appointment.

Hows it going, everyone? I decided to come on here because it looks like I may have posted on here before but I dont really remember doing it. I was checking my e-mail and saw some replies that lead me here but I dont even remember making an account. Of course curiosity got the best of me and after a few hours of reading the top r/nosleep posts and comments I figured maybe you as a community could help. Other posters seem to think so, anyway.

Every day I get up and do the same routine. Put on deodorant, get dressed, make a lunch for work, eat breakfast, warm up the car, gather up my phone and badge and keys and glasses and head to work. I listen to the same radio station, listening to the same stupid arguments about why our team is good or bad or how awful the refs were during the game. I park in the same parking spot, sit down and watch the same daily YouTube channel until it is time to clock in, say hi to all the same people from my office to the timeclock, and then go about my day. I repair things that I dont remember ever learning about almost like it is second nature to me. I eat lunch at the same time every day. With exactly fourteen minutes left to go in my shift I start to pack everything up, go take a crap in the bathroom, and clock out after washing my hands. When I get home I unpack my lunch, change into comfortable clothes, go through the mail, and relax with a beer and Netflix. Sometimes I go dancing on the weekends at a few of the cool bars around town.

I feel a satisfaction from it all, a sense of purpose and direction. But I dont know why. Or how.

I didnt take a crap today. Weird how that was what really stuck out to me but it was. No crapping. As I wandered (I never wander) around my new home (my old one burned down, but I didnt remember that) I looked at all the pictures and knick-knacks. Staring back at me are faces I dont recognize aside from a vagueness, a nagging feeling in the back of my head that says I should but dont. Written on the backs of them are names and dates and locations. *Shane, Lisa, Owen  Grand Canyon 94* Bowling trophies and a diploma from the local university, a huge new TV and surround sound decorate the rest of the house. It is very impersonal. I cant imagine I am this boring.

I found a box of DVDs and popped one in. Bourne Identity. Good movie. Maybe it was only good because I can relate so much to it. Afterwards I tried calling a few numbers in my phone. There were only five numbers so I decided to just call all. My sister, Lisa. Brother Owen. Parents. Lauren, girlfriend. Dave, boss. Of the five only two numbers were active. 

Dave sounded cheerful when he answered. I lied and said I was just testing out the reception of my new phone. Lauren practically jumped through the phone when I called and said she would be on her way over in a little while. I guess that is a good thing, maybe Ill get some answers. Anyway I finally feel the urge to take a crap so Ill log back in after Lauren leaves and hopefully have some answers.

-------------

**UPDATE:**

Everything seemed to go well with Lauren. We laughed and talked and went out for some Indian food. It seemed natural, normal, yet so hollow. Even the sex afterwards. Oh sure it was amazing, but somehow artificial. Like I didn't deserve it. Does that make sense? The weirdest thing was that when I went to pay for dinner I signed the check with [this](http://imgur.com/a/kAflx). That doesn't look like it fits my name at all.. </TEXT>

We ran. We stumbled. We ran some more. Blindly, without regard for direction or purpose. My lungs burned, my legs wobbly, and my face covered with sweat from sprinting up several flights of steps and across many yards of empty hallways. That was when I realized I never once heard someone chasing. I reached a hand out to Lauren to steady her and after a second to catch our breath I led her to my most secret hiding place. It was an unmarked room that only three people could open. We hunkered down and regained our composures and our breath. I hadn't run like that since high school! 

Fortunately I keep snacks in my hiding places so that I don't need to bring them around. Much less suspicious that way, you see. Anyway, I reached up to the back of the top shelf and brought down a box of frosted mini wheat and a box of Ritz Bitz crackers. We ate as silently as we could, to nervous to enjoy the sustenance. 

After a while we chanced a few whispers:

*What do we do?*

*Gotta wait. Listen for any pursuit or search party*

*Maybe security will think it was just a vandal. Maybe no one saw our faces*

*Do you know who even called out back there? I didn't recognize the voice*

*No I haven't even worked here a week yet..*

*What was that? Shhhhh*

--------

We practically broke our necks craning our ears toward the door in hopes of knowing what might be just outside. No other sounds were heard. Hours passed by but nothing seemed to be happening out side of our hiding spot. Lauren needed to pee and the bathroom was literally across the hall. She cracked the door, waited. Cracked a little more, waited. All clear. She darted across into the bathroom to relieve the building pressure in her bladder, a pressure I was starting to feel as well. 

My head snapped up and dizziness overtook me for a moment. Shit, did I fall asleep? How long? SHIT, WHERE IS LAUREN? Maybe I just dozed for a moment and she will be coming right back. I waited, counting seconds in my head. Five minutes passed. Ten.

The door screams as I open it. God, you are a loud bastard! I peek my head out and look both ways like a little kid crossing the street. I step out. Cross the hall to the bathroom door. Crack it open. *Lauren?* No answer. I step in and check all the stalls. It's empty. They got her. At this point I just stopped caring and ran out and down the hall toward the basement. If she was alive she'd be there. Maybe I still had time. 

Rounding the last corner of another completely empty hall I skidded to a halt. Hundreds of employees gathered in a circle, filing the entire warehouse and spilling out of the entrance and into the hallway. No one turned around and I stepped back behind the corner. There was a fire escape of the far side of the warehouse I could get to from outside and maybe see what was going on invisibly. Making my way out into the cold and around the hospital made me realize just how exhausted I was. It had been over a day since I had slept. Finally I got to the door and badged it open, pulling it open just enough to get my lean frame in. For once I was thankful for the fire code of two separate doors. The inner door had a window so I could see in without needing to open it. 

They had her. Standing on the door, hands chained together in front of her. I couldn't hear what they were saying but the president took a key out that matched a key being held by the HR director. The keys were attached to a chain hanging down almost to the ground from her hands and pressed into the holes in the door. A pale light emitted from the crease around the door as it slowly dropped down into the floor with Lauren chained to it. I could see her mouth split as wide as it could go and her entire body straining against the chains as she screamed. Still, she descended. The pale light moved and sloshed like water in a jacuzzi. Oh God they are going to drown her!

I watched in horror as her eyes slid past the edge of the floor. Then the top of her head. The light showed water just below her head. Then two facilties workers brought a metal cover over and set it onto the hole in the floor, sealing off the light. 

My mind raced but in all the wrong directions. What could I do. There were police in there. I couldn't call 911. I had to get her out and fast. Making my way back to my hideout, I sat and sobbed. It all flooded out. I couldn't help it. My body heaved and shuddered. Again, I fell asleep. 

When I awoke Lauren was staring down at me, a smile on her beautiful face. *Hi Shane*

-CRACK-

She must have hit me hard because when my mind regained it's abilities I was chained and surrounded by my coworkers. She called me Shane. I'm not Shane! The keys went in. I slowly descended into a frigid liquid. She knew my real name. Why? Why?! The lid was placed over my head. All light was sealed off. 

I'm not sure how long I was in there. And I'm not sure what I was babbling about this whole time to you all about. 

My name ***IS*** Shane.

Today something new happened, something I only now realize I've seen just once before. A body was carted, covered and zipped up in a silver bag, down the basement hallway past my workshop and into the morgue. I say it was new because up until right now as I type this out I  thought it was. But I'll get back to that. 

Moments after the faceless body bag was pushed slowly into a huge steel room I've never been in and hope to never be in I saw my first new face since working here. She was stunning, breathtaking even. I fulfilled every clich in that moment. My heart raced, my mouth hung open, and I'm pretty sure I had a semi. Her eyes mirrored every color that she passed. Her posture perfect yet not aggressive. Petite. And lips like Angelina Jolie. Describing her fills me with shame knowing I paid so much attention yet can barely stammer out a few ugly words. 

She stopped, held out her hand. *"Hi, I'm Lauren."*

*"Nice to meet --"*   ***"SHANE! This bed isn't fixing itself."***

*"Thanks boss. Thanks. I'll be right there. So yeah, nice to meet you."*

I must have looked like a kicked puppy because he apologized once I stepped into the workshop and closed the door. 

Lauren worked in food services, taking patients orders and delivering the food. I saw her often because I went from room to room fixing things and she went room to room filing bellies and lightening dark rooms with her eyes and smile. We talked a bit and something magical happened. She used my real name. I wasn't Shane to her. Do you know what it feels like to hear your name for the first time? It's impossible to describe but I took every chance to talk to her, just to hear her say it. We actually have a lot in common. Dancing, sports, same strange obsession with eating hot peppers. And by the end of the day exchanged numbers, planning on going out to dance tonight. If that goes well I hope to ask her over on Sunday to watch the game. 

During one of our three hundred conversations (I know, I know, pathetic) I drummed up the courage to ask her about the person she replaced. She didn't know much, except that her name was Lauren also. 

God, it felt so good to hear my name. I could listen to her say it for hours. Anyway, back to the body bag. This morning I thought it was the first time I'd seen one and just attributed it to a great hospital staff and modern medicine. But now I remember seeing a body rolled past me once before but I didn't realize what was happening at the time. It was my first day at work. Now that I think about it, it was the same two people pushing the body down the hallway. Weird.

Oh yeah, Lauren is calling! Gotta go get ready. 

She said my name again when I answered. I think I'm in love. 


We danced to a few songs, drinks in hand, never spilling a drop, smiling and grinding a bit. A weird song neither of us knew came on next so we took the opportunity to get some water and talk some more. 

"How come everyone at work calls you Shane?"

Her question caught me off guard, not because it was a difficult question to answer (or maybe it was) but because I never thought anyone would ask it. And everything came flooding out of my mouth. I told her about the employee I replaced and his name somehow passing on to me, about how much I hated it, about the door I found and the two dead bodies I'd seen. About them coming on first days and how she was the first new employee I'd seen in five months. My mind finally caught up with my mouth and I firmly placed my hand over it. 

*"I'm sorry, I talk fast when I'm nervous"*, I mumbled. 

*"You know what I think? I think we need to get into the morgue and look at that body."*

*"What, when?"* I asked. 

*"Tonight."*

That last word caused my drink to reverse course, spewing from the sides of my mouth. 

She laughed a melodious laugh, tossed a few napkins at me and got up, shaking her cute butt to the beat of the newest song. Sheepishly, I cleaned the corners of my mouth and bounced up behind her in an attempt to get close once again... and close we got. A few songs later and she suggested we head back to my place to plan our break-in. 

I'm writing this from my bed, her hair tickling my arm. It was some plan. 

-------------

**UPDATE:**

I am exhausted and scared. After a short nap Lauren and I got dressed for work, only we were going in seven hours early. Her plan was simple and flawless, or so I thought after a few drinks and an orgasm. A word to the wise, never trust your brain after sex. Anyway, the hospital is usually a ghost town after about 5PM in the basement because that is where all of the maintenance, facilities, cleaning type of workers have their offices and of course that is where the morgue. 

We came in through a door that doesn't need badge access but isn't a main entrance either so as not to be spotted and crept down to the basement. I had been here before at this time answering an on-call from the ICU department and it didn't seem creepy or frightening then but it certainly did now. The quiet was tangible, pressing against me with each step. Coincidentally the door that I found and the morgue are in the same large warehouse so I took Lauren over to it and showed her. 

Squatting down to get a good look with her I noticed the door was slightly damp and one of the plugs was missing from the two central holes that a handle probably fits into. While she ran her fingers over the door's seam I searched the immediate area for the plug, praying it wasn't me who lost it when I first discovered the door. I almost let out a whoop when I found it and pushed it back into it's home but when I did some liquid forced its way up and out of the hole. There was no noticeable scent to it, or strange feel or texture. It seemed to just be water. I guess the strangest thing about it was that ONLY the door was damp, not even a tiny portion of the surrounding floor. 

Instead of wasting too much time with a door I couldn't open we made our way over to the huge steel door that lead into the morgue. As I have said before, I have a lot of master keys and a few master codes to keypad doors. Fortunately one of them was the right one and after a few tries I was able to get the door open. We stepped inside of a small, chilly chamber just big enough for four people. In the center was a sleek steel table about eight feet long. On the left and right of the entrance were matching steel work tables, covered in gleaming surgical tools. 

Drills. Saws. Hundreds of scalpels of all shapes and sizes. Steel bowls and bins. Forceps. An industrial sink with huge over-head handles like in a restaurant. 

On the far wall was what we came in here for. Four steel doors with bodies behind them. 

I took a deep breath, shivered a bit from the cold air entering my lungs, and stepped across the room. One hand on the handle and one hand gripping Lauren, I pulled. Empty.

We locked eyes for a second, relief on both of our faces. I am not sure what we thought we would find in the first one but apparently both of our imaginations were running wild. I gripped the next one and pulled. Empty. The third, empty. The fourth, not empty. 

SHIT.

Another deep breath and I grabbed the sliding tray with both hands. It slide out easily on well maintained rollers and so did the Taco Bell we had on the way to the hospital. Staring up at us was Lauren. The old Lauren. The one that was replaced.

I couldn't breath, I couldn't think. I slammed the tray back in, shutting the door. Shit, vomit everywhere. Never eat Taco Bell. Never never. I leaped two steps over to one of the sinks and grabbed the over-head handle. The water stream was powerful and freezing cold. It blasted the vomit toward the drain underneath the center table easily and after a few seconds the floor looked brand new. 

*"Hello?"*

We ran.

Sorry about the delay. I was out of state at my brothers wedding. So. Much. Fun! I never realized I enjoyed dancing so much. I don't think I have ever been to a club or really ever danced at a wedding or party, either. Definitely going out this weekend to keep the party alive. During the reception I was talking to a few buddies and they were excited about the Super Bowl and how big their party was going to be, yada yada. That was when I realized that I had never thrown one myself. Or even been to one. Weird. I was in a pretty good mood heading back in to work until I clocked in and had my first "hello" from a co-worker. God, I hate that name so much. Shane. Shane. At least the time-clock knows what my name really is.

As I cruised around the hospital from repair request to the next my mind wandered back to that door I had found and I started to plan how I could get a fair amount of alone time with it to investigate. A few of our machines make a permanent home down in the basement but as long as we own them they need to be maintained so I decided I'd volunteer to take the lot of them on and get them calibrated for the year. All I needed was some tools and our calibration system to take down to them and I can work on them all day. My boss agreed quickly, probably because he doesn't want to do it, and so the next day I gathered up what I needed and headed down.

Once in the basement I laid out all of my calibration equipment and tools in a neat row and positioned all of the equipment that needed to be worked on around me in a circle, one so that I could access each one rather easily and two so that I could be mostly blocked from all views while I messed with the door that I placed strategically inside with me. I was about halfway through the first machine when I took a break to check out the real reason I was down there. Grabbing my mini Maglite and soft bristled brush I went to work trying to find a real seam or gap that I could wiggle a screwdriver into. As I worked it became increasingly more obvious that this was not supposed to be found. I'll do my best to describe my findings now.

The door is 16 inches by 16 inches perfectly square and 1/4th of an inch lower than the floor around it. It is perfectly level and has two small holes drilled into the middle nine inches apart. I couldn't see the holes before because they were filled in with some type of soft putty insert that matches the color of the floor, like a temporary plug. The holes are only an inch or so deep from what I can tell with the Maglite. The outer seam is also filled with that putty but more like caulking in this case and the seam is only 1/8th of an inch thick. This door is designed well! So well that it pushes my curiosity further and further into skepticism and fear. I have read enough r/nosleep and SCP articles to know when I am in too deep but somehow I am driven forward. Call it blind stupidity.

I could probably have finished up all of the equipment down there in one day but I knew that I needed to find the handle that lifted up that door so I took my time instead and split it up into two days. When I came in the next day an idea came to me. Maybe I could make my own handle. We have a huge parts room that rivals any hardware store. Surely I could cobble together something that fit the threads and be able to lift it up so I went and grabbed a few different sized bolts and washers to see what I could fabricate.

All of the first batch were too big but on the next visit I hit pay dirt with an eye-hook screw. Using an old power cable I threaded through both of the eye-hooks I had my handle. Giving it a tug was futile, however. Even getting into a deep squat and using my entire body I couldn't even feel the door give one bit. The cord snapped, I lost my balance and tumbled back into the equipment I had circled around, making a massive crash. Several people ran to the noise and fortunately I had enough time to get my eye-hooks out before anyone noticed.

*"Are you OK, Shane?! What happened?"*

Holding back a low growl I responded with a lame "I tripped" excuse and went back to work on one of the pieces of equipment.

*"Oh Shane, always being so clumsy! Do you remember the time Shane.."* Everyone walked out shaking their head and laughing and sharing stories of my clumsiness. The only problem is that I had never done any of the things that they talked about. Not a single one.

----------

UPDATE:

The episode today at work really freaked me out. I tried to distract myself by driving around, going into some stores but nothing could take my mind off of it so I went home and made some calls. First I called the hospital that Shane took a new job at to see if I could speak to him. The guy I spoke to said there weren't any Shane's working in Biomed. I asked a few questions, maybe he is in maintenance or something but still no Shane. With shaking hands I called a few more hospitals in search of Shane, then more, then all in the entire metro. No one had a Shane.

For some reason I called the first hospital back and asked to speak to the hiring manager this time. What he told me made my blood go cold. Yes, they hired Shane, but he never showed up to work.

I hopped onto Facebook next in hopes of finding a recent post by Shane and alleviate my fears. Shane hasn't made a post or picture or status for YEARS! Looking back thru his history he stopped posting a few months after joining my hospital. What is even more disturbing is that his only friends are coworkers. He used to have friends but must have removed them all. His last post had comments from other people, family it looks like based on last name, and a few school buddies. All of them appeared worried about something.

It didn't take long to dig thru his old posts because of the rarity of them so I started looking at my coworkers pages. After a few people I noticed a trend and after several hours of checking I have condoned that every single person that I work with is ONLY friends with coworkers. Not a single extra friend out of every person I could find. God, just typing that out makes me sick and cold inside.

Anyway, while I was out I decided to finally get a new TV so I picked up a 60 inch 4K Samsung for my football party this Sunday. I'm going to have everyone over for each game our team is still in the playoffs. I'd keep blabbing on but I'm off to go dancing. I'll update my progress with the door tomorrow.

My name is not Shane.

I just wanted to clarify that right now. Four months ago I began my career as a Biomedical Technician at a local hospital. It wasn't the best paying job and it was not as close as my last job to home but it was a start. Getting a foot in the door is the hardest part from what I understand. Anyway, my co-worker was really nice and the rest of the staff at the hospital seemed kind enough. Always waving and smiling. And never learning my name.

I attributed it to being new at first but even people I saw every day never remembered it. They could remember the once-a-week contractor just fine, but me? Nope.

Normally this wouldn't bother me because I have a hard time remembering peoples names as well and I have been known to say the wrong name from time to time. It started to bother me, however, when I had every single name memorized and NO ONE had mine. Petty? Maybe. But try it for a few months and tell me it doesn't get ridiculously annoying and belittling. What was even more strange is that everyone called me the same wrong name....

Shane.

After a month I was "let loose" from the training label and started to move a little more freely around the hospital instead of having to follow my co-worker around like a lost puppy. A part of our job is to do repairs on all of the equipment so I have the master code to all keypad locks and a few keys that will open basically any door in the hospital. In my down-time I'd wander around and explore, opening up random closets in search for lost equipment and to better understand the layout of the hospital (and to find a great hideout when I wanted to just sit and watch YouTube videos).

A few months of poking around and I had peeked into just about every room I could find but one day as I was looking thru some old equipment in the basement storage for a missing ECG machine I found a door. There was no key, no keypad, no lock, virtually no seams either. And it was on the floor. Once I cleared the clutter away I squatted down to inspect it.

Was it a drain? No, that didn't make any sense. Was it access to a sub-basement? Shouldn't even be one, all of our plumbing is here and our boilers are outside.

Just as I started to run my fingers along the very faint crease my body cringes from the sound I hate most.

"Shane? Shaaaaaaneee."

"Ya over here, and it's NOT Shane. Did you find the ECG?"

"Sure did, let's test it to make sure it still works."

Days went by but I couldn't get that strange "door" out of my head so I let myself into our records room that has all of the blueprints and schematics for the hospital hoping to find an answer. None. Not one damn mention of anything being underneath the basement storage. No electrical. No plumbing. Nothing. Undeterred, I make it a point to keep digging when I have time. I even made a daily alarm on my phone.

The next day during lunch my co-worker and I were talking about football and how we couldn't wait for the season to start. Our team was going to be very good this year, you know. Apparently the guy that I replaced was a huge football fan. Tailgated every Sunday, had huge parties for the Superbowl, that kind of thing. I had never heard anyone talk about him before so I asked what happened. It seemed like a sour subject because my co-worker just mumbled a bit about him not giving any notice and taking another job downtown at the school hospital. [Oddly enough I had applied for the same job but after making it to the final three candidates I was knocked out. Lack of experience, they said.]

"Sorry he skipped out on you like that. What was his name?"

"Shane."

UPDATE: Thanks to a vigilant helper my past has been resurrected. In my attempts to figure out what has happened to me /who I am it seems other powers are at work to stop me. Somehow this post was deleted but a good samaritan recovered it for me and I can now read it. I'll continue working on being able to read the others as well. Thank you all for your continued help in my identity crisis!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This game is just ridiculous now. The latest update is just awful and I am sick of all of the spoofers, alt account losers that wreck this game. I tried to take it all in stride but today was the straw that broke the camels back.

It was a pretty cold morning so I had my jacket and whatnot but my hands were freezing. Still, I decided to take a few level four gyms and collect my meager coins. I head to the first one and take it. Moving on the second I notice a dude in a car just watching me like I'm some sexy college girl. He sees me looking so he leaves. I am thinking, weird but whatever. Once I am done with the second gym I move on to the third and he is sitting there as well. I begin taking the gym but error out (freaking stupid game). It is cold so I give up and go to collect but behold the creeper has taken both gyms. Now this is the frustrating part about it.. THEY ARE THE SAME TEAM AS ME!!! The dude literally waited until I took out Valor and then took me out to place an Instinct in to collect coins. THEN he took himself out and put his other Mystic account in. WTF?!

Done. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright so I have purchased a spare battery, try to switch them every day or two and give them a day off before charging back up. I am still seeing very fast total battery capacity loss but that is somewhat to be expected. 

What I was NOT expecting is that my phone is basically a POS now. It lags even outside of the game, and when playing PoGo it is good half the time and awful the other half. Today I missed about half of my stops because it was hanging up so badly which I have never witnessed. Gyms are almost unusable.

Anyone else experiencing this? Is it specific to my phone?

Thoughts, methods of extending my phone life, comments, etc

Thanks! </TEXT>

Looking to band up with a few players to build some lvl 10 gyms and hold them.
