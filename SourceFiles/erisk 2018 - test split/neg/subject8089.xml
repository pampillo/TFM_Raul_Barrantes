<TEXT> I don't want to take a road trip with someone who won't sing with me.  Seriously.

When my son was small, we used to take a songbook with us so we would have lyrics handy and not have to rely on our spotty memories for choices.  My absolute favorite book for this purpose is [*Rise Up Singing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_Up_Singing),which, admittedly is crunchy-granola old-school, but nevertheless, *full* of classic tunes that basically everyone will remember fondly from childhood.

But yes.  Karaoke road trip = best road trip. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I entirely see your point, and fervently hope you're right.  But lack of access to information isn't the the only reason that atrocity-committing authoritarian regimes rise to power and even thrive.

A huge portion of Argentina's upper class was aware, at least on some level, of what was happening when people started disappearing, but they did not speak out against what was occurring, or even admit that it was happening.  Rather, they scoffed at the suggestion of such a thing and called those who dared to speak out hysterical lunatics, not because they didn't know, but because they believed that the "leftist dissidents" who were being kidnapped and murdered deserved that treatment.  Moreover, many were complicit or actively involved in the machinations of the incoming dictatorship, because they owned business concerns that in some way profited from the ensuing regime change and domestic turmoil.

It's true that time and place matter in applying the lessons of history, and that technology works in our favor here, but I don't think we are as different as a people as we need to be in order to be unconcerned about them. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  But saying they're detrimental to learning is baseless. 

I'm not going to rehash the "soft bigotry of low expectations" argument.  It's mainly a convenient way to deflect responsibility for institutional and systemic biases...but that's not even what the piece of my comment that you quoted was *about*.  

The whole signaling one's SES thing typically applies to *wealthier* students, who, like those with economic privilege everywhere, want you to be aware of what they have because of the power it accords them within our society.  That part of my comment had nothing to do with lower-SES students violating the uniform policy by not wearing it or wearing it inappropriately -- although certainly, lower-SES students may alter the appearance of the uniform to visually mark members of their own ingroup/outgroup as well.

 Around the world uniforms are compulsory.

Only in certain contexts, and for people of certain class/social statuses.  Uniforms exist where conscientiousness, procedure, and obedience are prized over critical analysis and creative thinking.  Saying they *can be* detrimental to learning is decidedly *not* baseless.  [Here](https://www.naesp.org/resources/2/Principal/2006/J-Fp50.pdf) is a report that found the implementation of uniforms correlated with statistically significant declines in overall and reading achievement in 10th graders.

Another study from 2010 found that:

 The findings indicate that student uniforms have no direct effect on substance use, behavioral problems, or attendance. Contrary to current discourse, the authors found a negative effect of uniforms on student academic achievement. Uniform policies may indirectly affect school environment and student outcomes by providing a visible and public symbol of commitment to school improvement and reform.

One of the most cited studies on this topic (Brunsma, et al., 1998) concludes:

 The findings indicate that student uniforms have no direct effect on substance use, behavioral problems, or attendance. Contrary to current discourse, the authors found a negative effect of uniforms on student academic achievement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't speak for /u/BlackMilk23's school specifically, but this nonsense is generally couched in terms of "extreme" hairstyles being a "distraction" in the classroom.  If that sounds like bullshit and doesn't make any sense, that's because it is and it doesn't.  The real reason, even if administration (or *management*, in the case of corporate charter schools) isn't aware of it/doesn't want to admit it, is nothing other than a fundamental belief that styles conducive to the texture of White people's hair are normal (*i.e.*, "good") and that those made to work with different textures of hair are weird (*i.e.*, "bad").

 We also have a rule that says the only permitted hairstyle for girls is straight.

Do you mind saying what jurisdiction you're in?  Or whether it's a private school?  I ask because employers have lost several EEOC suits brought against them for dress code policies that require women (or men) to straighten their hair or that prohibit natural, braided, or locked styles, unless there is a bona fide occupational necessity for such rules.

Even in a private school, I'm having trouble envisioning how such an obviously biased policy around hairstyles is permitted to exist.  Has the policy been challenged, to your knowledge? </TEXT>

IOW, even when Black, Latino, and White kids break dress code at the same rate (or controlling for same), the Black and Latino kids are much more likely to A) face sanction under the policy at all, and B) when they do, it is likely to be more severe than a White student who *is* punished would face.

<TEXT> It's not a false choice in any way.  To say that public school resources are severely limited is a gross understatement, and I'm not referring to monetary resources alone.  

To the extent that uniforms serve a more productive educational climate, a requirement for them is *arguably* reasonable (although there are plenty of reasons why, even if uniforms do promote discipline/orderly school culture they might still be undesirable, but that's a different thread).  However, when the student's only discipline infraction is one of dress code/uniform violation and not *conduct* in the classroom, then it serves *only* to create offenders out of those students who are more likely to have the policy unfairly applied and enforced against them.  That doesn't promote discipline or structure; it promotes contempt for unethical law enforcement, and disproportionately labels minority students as offenders, prepping them for the school-to-prison pipeline. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reading the article would probably help elucidate:

 School districts around the country have been revising policies to reduce suspensions and expulsions. Federal government studies have shown blacks and Hispanics are far more likely to face such harsh punishments, and as a result of more police involvement with schools, instances more frequently lead to arrests in what is known as the school-to-prison pipeline.

And

 This is the purest example of promoting discipline over academic performance, said Robert Goodrich, a co-founder of Radical Advocates for Cross-Cultural Education in Waterbury. He likened it to broken windows policing, which aims to keep peace by cracking down on minor offenses. </TEXT>

It's the conservative way.  If they can't pass legislation that legitimizes discrimination, they just deregulate and defund everything to the point where protections against discrimination are toothless and unenforceable, or outright nonexistent.  The advantage (because of who comprises their base) is they can then claim they didn't support bigotry, just small government. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm willing to believe he is *unaware* of the significance of his choice of "gift."  That's why I took care to clarify that the intent may have been other than conscious.  Just because he isn't consciously aware of these thoughts and motivations doesn't make them any less real, though.  

It's a weird, wholly inappropriate, needlessly gendered "gift" to make a show of.  Especially in a public place.  Especially when he has created a scenario that leads you to expect a wedding proposal.

The women's march was in January.  If he just wanted to give you an item that would have been useful to you, he would've done so in February, March, or April...not waited 4 months so he could use it as a blow to your ego/boost to his own at your expense.

Please hear me when I say this:

**The courting stage -- the period when he might propose -- is as good as it will ever get.**  If he's making you feel this way now, and choosing not to hear you when you attempt to communicate with him about it, that's a really big deal, because it's only ever going to get worse from here on out, never better.  I promise.

I saw your comment upthread that you're worried about "throwing away" 5 years.  I was, too.  So instead, I wasted **19 years** trying to make OK something that was rotten inside.  When it was all said and done, *he* left *me* (I was older than his taste, by that point).   Staying in a relationship because of the sunk cost fallacy is one of the most damaging things we do to ourselves.  And no, you can't get 5 years back, but you can get tomorrow back by making a choice today.

Zach's not only taunting you about not proposing, he went to some effort to do so...most guys don't want to bother with involving a waiter in their date even when it *is* to plant an engagement ring.  That means your bf put some thought and planning into hurting your feelings so he could see the "look" on your face.

It's also not lost on me that **the butt of his "joke" was your womanhood** -- consciously or not, the gift he gave you was intended to highlight how your anatomy is not only different from, but inferior to, his.  Taken together with the rest of his message, I can't imagine what you'd be choosing to stick around for. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  2) don't throw your hat onto the bed

Holy shit!  This is a Russian thing?  That explains a lot about my childhood.  My great-grandfather was a Ukrainian Jew and emigrated to the US.  I grew up living in the same house with him, his daughter (my grandmother), and *her* daughter (my mother).

In my house, the punishment for putting a hat on a bed was swift and violent...but I assumed, that like most other madness I dealt with as a kid, the source was Jewish culture.  When my great-grandfather grew up there, Ukraine was part of imperial Russia, and to hear him tell it, everyone considered it to be Russian.  So it's really interesting to hear you say that because it means that this belief probably came from the dominant culture, not that of the shtetl.  TIL.

 4) don't get upset at the bird that poops on you

I had this nonsense, too.  It's supposed to be "good luck" when a bird shits on you.  I never did understand how *that* works.

<TEXT> My high school Spanish teacher (and idol) was Argentinean.  She was passionate about everything, especially her fierce love for the country she had left behind and about telling its story to anyone who would listen.

She inspired me so much that when I had the opportunity to do a student exchange program the summer before my senior year of high school, I chose Argentina without hesitation.  I lived in San Juan for about 3 months in the summer of 1992 and it served only to captivate my imagination even more. Me encantaba su pas hermosa, y hasta hoy, cada da la extrao.

I returned to college at the age of 38 and decided to make use of my major (interdisciplinary social science) to examine some questions that remained unanswered, even after the time I spent there.  (In hindsight, I realize that 1992 was too close to the end of the Dirty War for anyone to want to talk about it, and it makes sense that I left feeling more bewildered about that era than I had upon my arrival.)   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't speak with any authority in the case of AMEX, but I used to work for Visa International and that's definitely a violation of the merchant's agreement with the card issuer. It's not a grey area; such things are explicitly prohibited in the contract between the 2 parties.

However, with that said, so are the "$5 minimum purchase" policies that so many (especially small) retailers have and even enforce.  It's explicitly not allowed to impose a minimum purchase requirement, or *even to permit a split payment* (your total is $100 and you want to pay $60 on your Visa and $40 in cash), but obviously, merchants all over do it all day long, every day.

Cardholders who are aggrieved by these practices can complain to both the issuer and the credit card company (not the same thing:  the issuer would be Chase, for example, and the credit card company is Visa).  Unless they're receiving *a lot* of reports about the same merchant, though, neither entity is likely to take much action.

TL;DR:  Are they *allowed*?  Not technically, no.  But in practice, it happens all the time and there's very little in the way of meaningful enforcement.

EDIT: removed a single extraneous, confusing word.

EDIT 2:  Thanks to u/BrokenFireEscape for the correction about recent changes due to Dodd-Frank.  From [the FTC's website:](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/new-rules-electronic-payments-lower-costs-retailers)

 Minimum Dollar Amount for Credit Card Purchases

 A PCN cannot stop you from setting a minimum dollar amount for accepting credit cards for payment as long as the minimum is the same for all credit card issuers and PCNs, and isn't more than $10.

 **What's new about that?** PCNs sometimes prohibited merchants from refusing to accept a credit card as payment if the customer's purchase didn't exceed a certain amount. For example, if you accepted credit cards at all, the PCNs or banks might have said you had to accept a credit card for even the most minimal purchases. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I stand partially corrected on the proportion of funding that comes from gun manufacturers; it's not the vast majority, it's just an awful lot.  And I can understand your skepticism of overtly biased media outlets, so will [*Forbes*](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2012/07/23/the-nra-industrial-complex/#5a3960e12506) do?

 Over 50 firearms-related companies have given at least $14.8 million to NRA according to its list for a donor program that began in 2005. That was the year NRA lobbyists helped get a federal law passed that limits liability claims against gun makers. Former NRA President Sandy Froman wrote that it saved the American gun industry from bankruptcy, according to Bloomberg.

And I'm not calling out "corporate" as an inherently bad thing.  I'm calling out the NRA's marketing themselves as being of and for the little guy -- the rugged, American individualist (which is absolutely their brand) -- completely disingenuous if they've turned into little more than a front for the interests of big business. </TEXT>

Yes.  Our state constitution says you can't be disqualified in court as a witness or juror -- *unless you don't believe in God*...or even simply don't believe in eternal reward/punishment.  How's *that* for a bare-faced violation of the establishment clause? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, so conflicted.

I'm what most would consider pretty far left on the political spectrum, particularly in the U.S., but the 2nd Amendment is where I typically diverge from most people with whom I otherwise agree on a majority of issues.

There's a very good reason the 2nd Am. is in our Bill of Rights; the founders understood that the people's ability to arm themselves is a fundamental deterrent against tyranny.  This is as true today as it ever was.

Practically speaking, though, there are real problems with unrestricted access.  The rates of gun violence in the U.S. are horrific (in places that have both lax and strict gun laws).  In addition, the 2nd Am. has been co-opted by some very unsavory elements of our society, including not only corporate gun manufacturers (that's what the vase majority of NRA membership and money *really* is, not hunters and sport shooters), but also the subculture now referred to as the alt-right.

Even though I am, in principle, a staunch supporter of the people's right to bear arms, the face of the movement to protect it is repugnant and I have no desire to associate myself with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think for solid writers, minimum length requirements often are counter-productive.  However, professors are somewhat caught between a rock and a hard place on this.  Students in all disciplines struggle with writing and, if you listen to instructors, the proportion who struggle enough for it to impact their academic output and performance seems to be growing.  One symptom of this is not knowing how to critically assess what a writing assignment as asking for and making sure to go deep enough with one's response to satisfy the assignment's standard.  For this reason, I think professors often create minimum length requirements as a basic safeguard to ensure that less competent writers/students at least aren't failing because they didn't even understand the depth/breadth/level of analysis demanded by the assignment.

TL;DR:  Minimum length requirements are for the weak students/writers, not the strong ones. </TEXT>

 Source: Worked for my state's DMV for 8 years and used to gleefully provide the insurance information for a given tag number when someone whose car got dented all to shit on the highway behind one of these motherfuckers would come in to ask for it. Those insurance claims were almost always successful because their warning means jack shit. Also, if a cop sees it, they will absolutely pull you over and ticket you, no matter what your stupid placard says.

<TEXT> You are objectively wrong.  Further, you are not *only* wrong, but aggressively offensive in the way you choose to make value and character judgments about not those who *perpetrate* heinous crimes, but not about those who have violent crimes committed against them.

First, the body and brain respond to sexual assault as violent crime because that's exactly what it is, even if it's coercion rather than brute force being used.  Rape isn't about sexual gratification; **rape is about power**.  Having one's power (i.e., agency; consent to what is possibly the most intimate possible act, both mentally and physically) taken away by another person by their sexual violation of you **is** being the victim of a violent crime.

Second, we are hard wired to treat rape as a clear and present threat to our survival because in human history, rape is often a precursor to murder, *especially* when perpetrated by men against women.

Third, even if physical force is not used, rape poses a very real risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection -- some of which are fatal.  This is unarguably an act of violence a person survives.

You do not consciously decide how your brain reacts in an emergent situation in which the fight/flight/freeze response is engaged.  That decision occurs in a split-second and it doesn't occur in your frontal lobe.  You admit you are uneducated about the matter.  Maybe you should take some basic (intro level -- my son covered this shit in high school) psychology, because that's the only background knowledge necessary to know how utterly, astoundingly wrong you are. </TEXT>

Since I obviously can't help myself and we're already on the subject, a tiny correction:  Accents in Spanish have 2 purposes. The first is the one you describe -- a visual marker of which syllable receives the stress in pronunciation (but only when the word in question breaks the rules regarding this).  So "nu**me**ro" ("I count") follows the rules and doesn't get an accent, but "numer****" ("number") doesn't follow the rules and needs that accent on the last syllable to show you how it's pronounced.

The second purpose of the orthographic accent is the si/s example.  Here, obviously, there is only one syllable, so the accent cannot be indicating stress.  Instead, in words like "s" the accent mark functions as a marker of *meaning*, not pronunciation.  It is the only way a reader knows to differentiate between "ms" ("more") and "mas" ("but") or "se" (reflexive pronoun) and "s"  ("I know").

Most native speakers aren't even aware of this second function because it works intuitively.  People like me, who learned Spanish as a secondary or tertiary language, tend to rely on those cues a lot if we were taught about them early on.

Now *I'm* sorry and feel the need to shut up.   :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> From another comment:

 So what do you learn about analysis if all you do is analyze without learning the actual fundamentals?

You keep alluding to "going deeper," "technical aspects," and "fundamentals."

I'm getting the sense, though, that you don't actually have any idea what you mean by that.  If you *do* know what you mean, please provide examples.  You said if you were to Google or read books on the subject you would necessarily encounter this more advanced material, so I assume you've done that, which should make it simple for you to be specific about what you think is lacking.

So far, you haven't done that at all.

In addition, just from reading your comments here, I feel perfectly secure in telling you that you aren't ready for anything more advanced than Freshman Composition, so I'm really not certain what your complaint is. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Maybe it's just hockey fans in general?

There may be something to this.

As I mentioned, I'm a DC native, too.  I grew up in a 'Skins household--my people didn't watch hockey.

My son started playing for his local rec league team when he was in 5th grade, and from the very first game I went to, I immediately noticed something was *different* about hockey fans.  There's a sense of them wanting to involve you in the fun they're having and not taking no for an answer.

I knew nothing about hockey when my son started to play, but that didn't last for long because other parents would sit next to me, manically calling out the play-by-play with explanations.


In some ways, the sport has more than its share of asshole fans (and asshole parents -- I don't know if you remember the "magic hockey helmet" thing from youth hockey many years back).  But overall, they are weirdly friendly and welcoming, and just generally great.  It almost seems like hockey fans love the game in a different way from other sports fans, and they're eager to be nice to you just so they can share their love of the game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have a very interesting argumentation strategy; I noticed it in the thread with /u/cesarjulius.  It seems to consist of *slightly*, almost imperceptibly, altering your opponent's argument so that you can make the point you *are* able to support, rather than addressing the *actual* point being made.  So let me see if I can be crystal clear:

My point wasn't that punitive damages exist across all 50 states without exception.  I did not say that punitive damages are the law of the land regardless of jurisdiction.  My point was that, where they *do* exist (which, even by your data, is the vast majority of states), their purpose is unarguable. The whole reason that most states' civil codes provide for punitive damages in civil liability (and particularly product liability) cases is to punish those who committed the tort in a severe enough way that it actually hurts, thereby acting as an incentive to change their practices and a disincentive to repeating the tortious conduct.

You may think they are ineffective; you may have other philosophical disagreements with them as a mechanism of justice. Again, your criticism of their value and efficacy has absolutely no bearing on the express purpose for which punitive damages *do* exist with respect to civil liability, especially with respect to *product* liability. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can disagree all you like; luckily for the rest of us, facts don't depend on your approval.

In the civil justice system in the U.S., punitive damages are expressly intended as a mechanism to **punish** the entity that committed a tort. It's exactly as /u/cesarjulius describes:  the punishment is *supposed* to be large enough that the wrongdoer is provided with an actual disincentive to repeat the behavior and therefore, change their practices.

You may not *like* the fact that this is the specific, conscious intent of the existence of punitive damages, but that doesn't change the fact that it absolutely *is*. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a huge nerd about mythology in general.  By far, my favorite class in college was an English elective called "Mythology, Legend, and Folklore."

I'm partial to the Greek myths in general.  As a kid, I spent *hours* in my room poring over [D'Aulaires Book of Greek Myths](http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSyTznJwjsrGtsQMMp9IhIFrXy1I_vvMnafSwB9_obSnqaL-6v0).  It's always been hard for me to choose a favorite, but I'm very partial to the story of Demeter, Persephone, and Hades.  I've also always been fascinated by Hestia -- she's included as an Olympian in most versions of the stories, but there's some evidence that her existence as a goddess of home and hearth predates the body of them.

This answer makes me feel like a traitor to all of the other stories that I love....Artemis and Orion, Echo and Narcissus, the birth of Athena....

This is hard. </TEXT>

*My* spidey-sense is telling me that they are trying to play CYA with regard to a potential wrongful termination suit because *they* know the reason they're prematurely terminating OP's contract is because of the FMLA use.  That's illegal (but employers do it all the time) and what they're worried about is that sooner or later, OP's going to put 2 and 2 together.  So to protect themselves from him making a complaint later, they're attempting to have OP create a paper trail that belies that argument.

<TEXT> He didn't force any student to do that, and he *did* encourage original thinking.  The way the assignment was presented and graded meant that if a student approached it from an earnest perspective (took a crack at it) and supported a particular argument for a plan of action/solution, he was graded on the cogency of his argument and supports used. It's not like he failed (or graded poorly) students who didn't catch on to the trick.  It's just that he was also rewarding students who were able to synthesize the lessons we had learned over the course of the semester that point strongly to the idea that this nut is particularly hard to crack. </TEXT>

It may not be *technically* unsolvable, in the sense that sooner or later, something's got to give.  But for a host of complex, interrelated reasons, this is a knot that is, *practically* speaking, not one that is realistic to think can be unraveled.

When I took "Foreign Policy of the United States" in my poli-sci program, the term paper was about our North Korea policy.  It was supposed to be roughly split in thirds:  trace and discuss the modern history of U.S. policy / analyze and evaluate said policies / recommend solutions and future courses of action.

The last third was a trick question.  The professor actually expected us to be able to explain in the last third of the paper why there wasn't any known realistic solution to this conundrum, not solve it...because we had spent the entire semester learning all of the reasons why it is unsolvable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> /u/MaskedDropBear has given some excellent advice here, *especially* about knife skills and mise-en-place.

I only have a couple of things to add:

Get yourself a copy of the *Joy of Cooking*.  It's old-school in the best possible way...an encyclopedia of the most important information you need to know about ingredients and cooking techniques as well as classic and innovative recipes.

There's a reason that book has been the kitchen bible of generations of home cooks.

As far as recipes, it's kind of hard to narrow down suggestions without knowing your taste or where you are in terms of skill.  What is your favorite meat/vegetable/grain/fruit?  What kinds of ethnic food do you like? </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK...since you and /u/Devagamster both asked so nicely, I'll try to recap briefly for you.

After I mentioned that my son had figure skated in elementary school, dudebro says, "I am so, so sorry."  To which I replied, "That's cool, but I'm not..."

He then told me to let him know how that was working out for me when my son started to identify as an Apache attack helicopter.  My reply to that begins with, "Oooh, I love it!"

Then he pretended to be confused and asked why I thought he was talking about the figure skating (as opposed to...?) and said he was just sorry that I have a kid.  Sorry for my son and sorry for me, he said.

I stopped replying at that point, but then some other people called him out and his answer was that I was a bad parent and a boring person, and I knew it.

I hope that's not too convoluted to follow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While jurisdiction should always be the first question you ask, in this case, it pretty much doesn't matter what state he's in, and here's why:

Since "Motor Voter" legislation was enacted federally in the '80s, virtually all of the state boards of elections began using not *just* voter registration data, but *also* DMV records, to compile their jury duty rosters.

What this means is that in almost every state (I can guess at 1 or 2 exceptions, but I won't, because I'm not sure), if you have a driver's license or state-issued ID card **it doesn't matter at all what party you are registered with, or if you are even registered to vote, period**...you will still end up on the jury duty roster.

I personally haven't heard it, but I am old enough to remember that even back when it happened in 1998, there was more than tacit acknowledgement that it was pointed and selective enforcement of the prohibition.  Again, it was *really* common for skaters in commercial and non-competitive productions to do backflips going all the way back to the '70s...  Hamilton was by no means the only one.  The prigs running the show for the Olympic figure skating committee were just uber pissed that a woman had managed to consistently pull it off -- and she had the gall to be a black woman, at that! </TEXT>

 You'd think, but that's only the ostensible reason.  As I explained in another comment, we know that's not true because figure skaters have been training for and doing backflips and other similarly dangerous tricks for decades -- just not in competition.

 For example, the backflip is actually Scott Hamilton's signature move, and he was known for performing it at the hugely commercially popular Ice Capades, as well as on televised expo performances.

 It *is* dangerous, but all of figure skating is dangerous.  The actual reason it was banned from competition (especially strictly enforced for women) was *propriety*, though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeesh.  Don't get me started.

*Some* of the rules make sense, of course...at least they still do compulsories...kind of.  Most people don't even know though (because it's a boring-ass event no one watches) that the "figure" in figure skating comes from the fact that the first skaters were judged primarily by how accurately they could trace prescribed shapes, such as figure 8's, into the ice.  So, in that sense I'm glad they have maintained what may seem, from the outside, like arcane rules.  Because a skater's ability to meticulously draw shapes into the ice actually does speak to how technically proficient she is.

But the bulk of figure skating's rules are prissy, elitist bullshit that are about as clear as mud and as consistent as a crackhead's work attendance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That doesn't really hold water when figure skaters, especially male figure skaters, have been performing this (and other far more dangerous) moves in expositions and other non-competitive performances since the '70s.  The backflip has been Scott Hamilton's signature move for *decades* (Ice Capades, anyone?), and it's certainly not inherently more dangerous for a woman to attempt it than for a man.

Like most figure skating rules, it has little to nothing to do with athletes' safety, but public image and the sport's own self-concept as an activity of the "well-bred."  No, seriously.

1)  "It just doesn't look nice."

2)  "We've always done it this way."

<TEXT>  The correct response is "Thank YOU!"

As someone who has worked in one customer service capacity or another for more than 2 decades, I understand where you are coming from with this, in that the business owes thanks to the customer, not the other way around.

But it's important to remember that "you're welcome" is considered the polite response to "thank you" in virtually every other social context, and that its use is so ingrained in people that saying it is often more reflexive than intentional.  It's also important to remember that the cashier using the "incorrect" response probably makes minimum wage but can be fired for her till being off by a few cents -- and that, unless she works at Chik-Fil-A -- there's an excellent chance that no one has *ever* told her how or why a customer could take offense to this.

<TEXT> I know a *lot* of people who fish who do it for the meditative aspect more than for the food or sport...but most of them discovered that by accident on their own; it's not why or how they started fishing, typically.

One of the reasons, I think, that it's so hard to explain this "other purpose" of fishing to the uninitiated is that in popular culture, it's really not been marketed or perceived that way.  For one thing, it's called "fishing" not "chillaxing on a boat gazing into the water," which understandably leads people to the conclusion that it must be all about the fish.  For another, "fish stories" are a well-known trope, but their retelling tends to be competitive and boisterous. 

So what people who've never fished think they know about the activity gives them no frame of reference for how passive/receptive of a process it is by its nature, and no concept of how much time is necessarily spent just 'being' there on the water. </TEXT>

But he also knows that the entire rest of the state, including Frederick Co at this point, would *destroy* him at reelection time if he allowed PP to go under here in Maryland.

His heart and ideology may be closer to the national Republican party platform, but Hogan is nothing if not a pragmatist.  And he's well aware of what state he's governing, even if he doesn't always agree.

It is hard to identify the most sinister consequence of his attack on democratic institutions, but if I had to pick only one, it would be his intentional dismantling of the free press. </TEXT>

In the early '90s, though, the thing everyone was focused on was how much water, land, and energy it takes to produce 1lb of meat compared with 1lb of plant-based food.

<TEXT> I've given this answer previously, so apologies if you've heard the story:

 The first stumble off the wagon was when I got pregnant at age 20 and I had intense, unfightable cravings for seafood. To say I gave into them would imply a choice in the matter I did not have. When the baby was born, we initially raised him as a pescetarian (vegetarian who also eats seafood).

 When my son was 4, we went to a birthday party for a friend of his. Unlike at previous events, the veggie dogs we had brought with us and thrown on the grill were no longer acceptable to him. All of a sudden, he was acutely aware that the hot dog on his friends' plates was not the same as the one in front of him, and he wasn't having it. In a split second, I decided that this was a battle I wasn't willing to pick...I inherited enough food issues from my parents, and I wasn't willing to sow those seeds with my 4-year old over a frankfurter at a birthday party.

 So my son ate a hot dog, loooved it, and that was the first step down a steep and slippery slope back toward full-fledged omnivorousness. </TEXT>

But as an older queer woman, I gotta tell you -- my recollection is that Subarus were verrry popular with my friend group of women in comfortable shoes way back in the mid-'80s, well before that ad campaign.

<TEXT> I can disprove this one for you.

My father owned a 1973 metallic gold Super Beetle.  (I'm still a teensy bit salty that he never put it up on blocks to save it for me the way he promised to.)

My former next-door neighbor was a man who owned a silver 2004 VW Beetle.  He was also a very interesting character.  When he moved in, he told us he was an insurance agent, but within 2 weeks, he said he had "resigned" from his job to be a full time gambler in Atlantic City.  Within a couple of months after *that*, he had stopped coming home most of the time, since collection goons had started making unannounced visits to his house at all hours. 

So, my (extremly limited) sample size and experience would indicate that some men do, indeed, drive VW Beetles, but only a very particular, prissy sort of man who is simultaneously narcissistic and self-absorbed, yet unaware of how ridiculous he looks. </TEXT>

Rather, they are a flaky, many-layered savory bread that is much more akin to an American southern-style biscuit, complete with buttery layers that peel apart.  Warm them over a low burner and eat plain, with dulce de leche, or literally *anything*.  *So, so* good.

<TEXT> All of this assumes you are car camping rather than backpacking. I was vegetarian, but not vegan, for a longish time, so here's what I remember.

Foil pouches are your friend.  Fill with veggies of your choice, season, and grill.

Things that are particularly excellent this way are asparagus, mushrooms, summer squash, onions, bell peppers, artichokes (make sure they're small), and corn on the cob.

Vegetarian baked beans and tofu dogs feels like camping food.

Veggie chili and cornbread is always good...you have an iron skillet, right?

One of my favorite things was making falafel [(from a dry mix like this)](https://thetab.com/uploads/2016/03/IMG_3624-e1458523656153-640x853.jpg) pita sandwiches with onion, tomato, and tahini.

And then I did a quick google.  I can't vouch for the recipes in the following links, as I haven't tried them, but here are ["14 Outrageously Good Vegan Campfire Recipes"](http://www.theflamingvegan.com/view-post/12-Great-Vegan-Campfire-Recipes) and several different ideas for ["Vegan Campfire Food"](http://veganstreet.com/vegancampfirefood.html) and the [Happy Herbivore's suggestions for planning vegan camping trips.](https://happyherbivore.com/2013/06/plant-based-vegan-camping-trip-outdoor-cooking/). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tea is not "technically anything."

Tea is specifically a beverage made from an hot water and cured leaves of the plant *Camellia sinensis*, an evergreen shrub native to Asia.

The word is often misused, as in the phrase "herbal tea," but this is not correct.  Properly, a beverage made from other (not tea) leaves and hot water is an *infusion* or if you are French, a *tisane*.

Coffee, however, cannot be tea.  Technically, it too, is an infusion -- one with its own unique name:  coffee. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, I should clarify that while I was raised in a very observant household and went to private religious school from nursery school through 7th grade, I no longer practice, and haven't in some time.

Yes, the Torah contains admonishments against same-sex activity, as does the New Testament and the Quran, but there are plenty of LGBTQ Christians and yes, even Muslims.

Furthermore, there are 3 main branches of American Judaism:  Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform.  The official stance of reform Judaism is extremely welcoming of LGBTQ individuals and that of Conservative Judaism only somewhat less so.  It's really only Orthodox congregations (at least in the U.S.) that are intolerant toward LGBTQ people.

I'll also point out that the Torah contains a several dozen prohibitions against consuming food considered to be unclean or even "an abomination" -- the exact same language used to describe men having sex with men -- but a whole lot of Jews don't keep kosher, either.  They're still Jewish, too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My rabbi.

Rumors started circulating within the congregation when I was 4.   This was 1979 and it was about the juiciest gossip the sisterhood ladies had ever gotten their claws into.  Within a couple of short months, he had been forced out of his position.

It broke my heart because I *adored* our rabbi; he was one of the warmest, kindest adults I knew as a child.  All's well that ends well, I suppose.  Not long after that, he helped to establish one of the first and most successful synagogues for LGBTQ Jews and their families.  It turned out to be a hidden blessing, if you will. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I worked a full-time job, a seasonal weekend job, and went to school full time for 7 semesters in a row -- until this (my final) semester when I hit a wall.

I kept it up because I had to.  I didn't have a choice.  I went back to school after my ex and I separated because I had a teenage son to take care of, but my salary wasn't making ends meet and I had reached a point in my career where I couldn't get promoted without a degree.

So, I did what I believe is technically known as "humping it" for 3 years.  The first 2 years, I took as many online classes as I could because I was still working a regular 8:30 - 5:00 schedule.  I got up in the morning, worked all day, sometimes went to an evening class, and then went home and did homework or studied for at least 2-3 hours.  Some nights, I cooked dinner.  Other nights, especially if I had class, my teenager did.

Then, when I transferred from my community college to a 4-year school, I moved and took a different (even lower-paying) job that gave me the flexibility to work weird hours around my classes.  That was important because my new school had far fewer online options than my CC did, but I knew that going in and wanted the classroom experience.

This is my last semester; I am scheduled to graduate in May.  At the beginning of this semester -- about 2 weeks in, I realized that even though I have done it so many times before, I just couldn't keep all those plates spinning any longer.  I woke up in a cold sweat at 3:30 one morning, sick with the knowledge that I couldn't keep working and successfully complete the 18 credits I'm taking -- all of which I need for graduation.  At this point, being sooo close to done, failure is simply not an option.  So I resigned from my job and I took a tiny student loan to pay the remainder of my living expenses for the next 8 weeks or so until I can go back to work--any work.

Also, caffeine.  Lots and lots of caffeine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've told my story before on other subs, but not here, I don't think.  Apologies if you've heard it previously, but this is a question I always answer when asked.  The following is from a previous post:


 My son was 15 months old when I found out I was pregnant for the 2nd time. My extremely abusive now-ex and I were badly on the rocks (as we would continue to be for most of the next 16 years) and about to get evicted from our apartment. I was still in the grips of severe post-partum depression, and really struggling to take care of myself and my baby.

 Having another child at that point would have been the absolute worst thing I could've done for myself and the child I already had brought into this world...not to mention the one that would be born. I didn't have enough money to provide well for the one I had...how could I do right by 2 of them? I was barely holding on in terms of my mental health day-to-day...if I pushed the reset button on nonstop diaper changing and sleep deprivation was I really going to be able to to hold on, let alone be the kind of mother I wanted to be?

 I don't care how people think this sounds: That abortion was the best thing that ever happened to me and to my son. I have no doubt that it prevented me from deteriorating into either suicide or commitment to a mental health treatment facility. I was terrified before the procedure that I would never forgive myself and that I would always have guilt about it. Instead, I felt instantly better as soon as the procedure was over, and I have never once regretted it.

 19 years later, I am more certain today than I was then that having that abortion saved my life and my son's life in a very real way. I had no car, no driver's license, no family support structure, no health insurance, no money, no paid time off, and a shitty wage-slave job that wouldn't have thought twice about firing me for missing work to accommodate a waiting period or multiple clinic visits.  My ability to easily, safely, and relatively affordably access that procedure using public transportation and about a week's rent was the difference between me and my son having a shot at a decent life and me leaving behind 2 young children to be raised in the system, or worse, by their abusive, dangerously mentally ill father.  I am more than happy that I had it; I am profoundly grateful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 41, so I grew up on vinyl records and cassette tapes.  My parents were huge audiophiles, so maybe I learned to listen to albums as whole works because of their understanding of how they tell stories, or maybe it was just because the technology we were using was so much less conducive to to picking and choosing songs.  Picking up and putting down the needle all the time to skip songs on a record was frowned on in my house, and in later years I came to hate playing the rewind/fast forward game with cassette tapes quite a lot.

When CDs became a thing, it was one of the most exciting things that had ever happened to me, because now you could just pick the track you wanted to listen to...or even--gasp!--play the tracks on random.

Then mp3s became the format of choice and you didn't even have to buy the whole album anymore at all.

Somewhere in this glut of musical freedom, I forgot about listening to whole albums.  And it seems like a lot of other people did, too.

What's interesting to me, though, is that I don't think you're alone in rediscovering the joy of listening to an album from start to finish.  Just last week, my 20-year-old son said to me offhandedly, "Y'know, I just figured out how listening to a whole album works.  I never really understood there could be connections between all of the songs that way.  It's awesome."

He's right, and so are you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a non-traditional college student at a small state school in a very rural, very red area.

Today, I got into a conversation with a (much younger) classmate of mine and we meandered onto on the subject of LGBTQ literature.  She, like many people I've met since moving here, grew up with a much bigger dose of compulsory heterosexuality than I did and she really hasn't been exposed to writing during her adolescent years that has spoken to her as a wlw.

I started sharing the names of authors, books, and other publications I "grew up on," but I was a teen in the late '80s through mid-'90s, so the names that spring to my mind are Audre Lorde, Joanna Russ, and Adrienne Rich...and magazines like "On Our Backs."

While I mentioned these (and many other) works to her, I can't help but feel that much of what was so meaningful to me 25+ years ago may not have the same impact on her.

So, raptors, if I could share them all with her: What books or other written works have meant the most to you as a woman who loves women?  What made them special to you? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Although your post was removed, I will answer your more pointed questions, lest you think I lack a response.

Where did I get that?  Years of professional HR experience.  I have seen countless employees shafted because they were operating from the premise that HR was on their side.

Grave repercussions such as what?  For example, if an employee isn't aware that HR is there to benefit the organization and not them individually, then they also wouldn't know that their internal EEO/fair practices office could possibly have a motivation to bury employee grievances and allegations of discrimination by intimidating, coercing, and threatening them...and that for this reason, should they make such a report, they should also *always* make a report to the external government body that oversees such matters.

One organization that I used to work for had an established practice of encouraging employees to come forward with grievances so that they could target those employees for termination on other grounds.  It was entrenched retaliatory activity as a systemic process, and it's lamentably common.  Colleagues of mine in similar departments have strikingly similar stories.  This is just one tiny example.  Other ways that employees get screwed involve benefits accrual, time and attendance, seniority calculations, use of FMLA, and on and on.

There is no nuance required whatsoever in order to correctly assert that HR departments -- as I said, from an organizational structure perspective -- exists to benefit and protect the organization, not the individual employee. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whew. For someone promoting the use of nuance and critical thinking, you sure were quick to erect that strawman.  No one here or anywhere else I have seen has said that "all HR and org. are bad and do not care about you."

What I *have* seen, though, is people reminding others that from a organizational structure standpoint, HR is there to help the company, not to help the individual employee.  That's flat-out true, and forgetting that detail can have grave repercussions.  Even though there are plenty of good people working in HR, it's simply naive not to understand what their objective is and the fact that their job is about protecting the organization, not the employee. That has nothing at all to do with nuance, critical thinking, or confirmation bias...just reality. </TEXT>

And while "impossible to love" may be different from "not a good person" (because that's what I was arguing -- not that he is a *bad* person), it's really *not* too different if the reason people who have had intimate relationships with you feel that way is that you treated them cruelly.  Consistently disregarding the feelings of the people in one's life who are supposed to be important to you is absolutely one piece of evidence that someone is not a *good* person. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not just talking about him being an edgy late adolescent during his early career.

I don't think anyone can make a serious argument that the common perception of him being a dick is related to his decision to plug in at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965.  Sure, many of his original fans were furious and felt utterly "betrayed" (their words) by that decision, but that has no connection to his reputation for being prickly, demanding, mercurial, and caustic on a one-on-one basis -- which is what his reputation *really* is.

Even people like Joan Baez, who have defended him and justified his behavior, have said that he is the sort of person who is impossible to love from up close -- at least for long.

This isn't about his exchange with his audience or some gadfly journalists 45 years ago.  This is about how many, many people who have known and worked with him intimately over the years seem to have a striking consensus about how a level of intimacy with Dylan eventually makes one feel.

Also, he's not young anymore.  If he weren't kind of a dick, he probably would have matured enough by now (age 75) to gracefully accept a truly prestigious honor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's an interesting question, and I guess I would say maybe it comes down to how you differentiate between the definitions of "good" versus "great.  For the record, I'm not *necessarily* suggesting that *I* am either one.  Dylan has, indeed, done some not insubstantial philanthropy. In addition to all of his work during the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War eras of the '60s and '70s, [looktothestars.org reports that the supports Amnesty International, City of Hope, End Hunger Network, Feeding America, K9 Connection, and Music Rising.](https://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/bob-dylan)

I'm not attempting in any way to minimize how important any of that is.  It's just not what I meant when I said "good."  To me, good has a lot to do with how you treat people one-on-one.  It's certainly not the *only* measure, but is a person really good if everyone they interact with feels like shit afterwards?

  You can be a good person and still a condescending dick.

I'm not sure if I agree with that, is what I'm saying.

Bob Dylan is my personal example of "never meet your heroes."  I consider him to be one of the most important American artists; a truly outstanding talent who is properly regarded as belonging to a class above all but the most select few.

But everything I've ever read, heard, or seen about him on an interpersonal level says he's also a perfect example of how those people we consider "great" are very rarely "good." </TEXT>

<TEXT>  They are too dumb to know any better

I, for one, am not willing to let them off the hook like that.

It takes the cognitive ability of a preschooler to understand that there are some things we don't say to people because they are rude, unacceptable, and make other people feel terrible.

If a grown-ass adult is *literally* too dumb to know any better, then he is so developmentally delayed that he also shouldn't be able to feed/bathe/dress/toilet himself, and I don't think that's what's going on here.

I will grant you that many, many men are raised to believe that the behavior *is* "just being a man," but with exposure to the appropriate carrots and/or sticks, the vast majority are capable of learning and acting differently. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're most welcome.

And as a lifelong MD resident and former MVA employee, I see your point about differences between the states from both sides.  

People complain a *lot* about vehicle taxes and inspection regulations in Maryland.  OTOH, the difference between the overall condition of PA and MD roadways is *striking* when crossing the Mason-Dixon, especially in western counties.  Personally, I am awfully glad to get home to non-pothole-rutted roads and I'm willing to pay my share of what that costs.  With regard to inspection, our checklist is nit-picky and much more comprehensive than many states -- but many states make you do an annual inspection, and MD only requires it when the vehicle changes ownership.  So, that part balances out easily, I think. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Former long-time MVA employee here.

In general, the state is extremely strict about enforcing the 60-day rule, but in certain cases, if you can establish that you *attempted* to comply with the requirement but were unable to for reasons beyond your control, then you can be granted a waiver of the excise tax.

I don't think you are eligible, however.  Here's your problem, based on what I understand from your narrative:

Once your lien holder sent the title to the MVA, what you were "supposed" to do was immediately title the vehicle in MD and spend an extra $20 (in addition to the title fees and taxes) to put a temporary (30-day) tag on the vehicle that would have allowed you time to make the repairs it needed to pass inspection.

Instead, you kept it registered in PA, which is exactly what the MVA is trying to discourage you from doing.  So unless I'm misunderstanding the time frame/order in which this all occurred, I think you are, unfortunately, out of luck.

EDIT: Because I failed to answer this part of your question:  Your PA lease is **meaningless** to the MVA.  They know you have been here since *at least* the date your title arrived from the lien holder.  They may have proof that you've been here since before that, depending on when you first converted your driver's license or what service dates are shown on the utility bills you likely presented as proof of residence. </TEXT>

Thank you.  The way people dehumanize and demonize people with BPD makes me so sad.

I completely understand making the choice to set whatever boundaries/limits one feels are appropriate/healthy, even if that means ending a relationship because a person doesn't feel equipped to deal with the manifestation of a condition's symptoms within one's partner.  And I get that it can be daunting to think about living with someone who has an "incurable" illness.  But what I don't get is why people seem to have a tendency to single out and scapegoat people with BPD, when the reality is that *all* personality disorders are notoriously difficult to treat and have symptom clusters that can be very difficult for other people to constantly deal with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've worked in customer service in some capacity for over 20 years. People are entitled, irrational assholes and I've known people who pull off this exact scheme.  So on that front, I agree with you.

But my experience with the overall quality of their products is different from yours, I think.  You're right, the boots are still top notch.  But as I mentioned elsewhere, it's not just the clothing that's gone noticeably downhill.  For example, my backpack of theirs that I purchased in the '80s is still in near-perfect condition despite decades of heavy use, while the one I purchased for my son in the early '00s has fallen apart -- twice.

As I said, their quality is still better than the majority of their competitors, and I still have a lingering fondness for the brand --but it *isn't* what it used to be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As others have mentioned, there is no definitively effective treatment for BPD.  For this reason, it tends to be among those diagnoses that make it most difficult to sustain intimate relationships with an individual.

However, if you are committed to the idea of making the relationship work, there are a number of resources that may be helpful to you.  One my therapist suggested to me when my ex and I were still together is a book called, *I Hate You--Don't Leave Me: Understanding the Borderline Personality* by Jerold Kreisman.  Another was *Stop Walking on Eggshells: Taking Your Life Back When Someone You Care About Has Borderline Personality Disorder* by Paul Mason and Randi Kreger.

IIRC, both of these books explore the strategies that /u/BadKarmaKitty lists in her (?) comment and give practical, as well as theoretical advice.  It's been awhile, so I have to admit that I don't remember the specifics in terms of comparing one to the other very well, but I *do* have a strong recollection of feeling like both of these titles were helpful to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dammit.  I'm always too late to threads on r/books.  Elizabeth Wurtzel's ability to so accurately put into words what I have felt and experienced (as a woman with depression of nearly exactly the same age and cultural upbringing) has been one of the most important factors in my perseverance in my own struggles against depression and anxiety.  Reading her books allowed me to know with certainty that I am not alone in this world; there have been nights when that knowledge saved my life.

OP, if you should happen to see this comment, I have one favor to ask of you.  Please read her book, *Bitch! In Praise of Difficult Women*.  While Prozac Nation resonated with me, *Bitch!* felt like Wurtzel had invaded my brain, siphoned my life story out of it, and told it back to me more beautifully, eloquently, and compassionately than I ever could have. 

If *Prozac Nation* was worthwhile to you, I urge you to grab a copy of *Bitch!*.  It's in the top 5 most influential books of my life. </TEXT>

The numbers I'm familiar with say it's not 80, but more like 30-40 years for them to reach maturity for harvest purposes.  Typical growth rates are 2' - 3' per season, with most specimens averaging around 80', but larger ones reaching 100' or more. This is slower than white pine, certainly, but there's no comparison between the quality of those 2 types of wood. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is so, so much to thank you for in this post.  But more than anything, even more than standing up for women who choose to terminate their pregnancies, **thank you for being courageous enough to admit that motherhood, especially if you don't desperately want it, isn't all about fulfillment, reward, and nurturing, instinctive maternal warm fuzziness and rainbow-colored unicorns shitting glitter.**

In modern western culture, especially in the U.S., admitting to any emotions toward motherhood other than adoration, reverence, and deep gratitude is to reveal oneself as fundamentally flawed.  If one should -- heaven forbid!-- be deemed a "bad mother," it is tantamount to a formal adjudication that one has failed as a woman.

Thank you so much for being willing to speak honestly about this, because it has been my experience, unfortunately, that women are harshest with one another in terms of enforcing what's considered to be acceptable attitude and speech about the experience of motherhood.  It's one reason why so many women suffer needlessly with post-partum depression and even psychosis; they are reluctant to talk about how much they are struggling (either consciously or unconsciously) because of the stigma associated with not being 100% thrilled to be a mom 100% of the time. </TEXT>

Of course an issue this big is always multifaceted, so yes, unsustainable harvesting practices certainly contributed to the devastation we've seen.  However, in *Appalachia* specifically, the reliance of virtually the entire population, in one way or another, on this single American Chestnut species, cannot be overstated.

When the blight arrived and the heart of the region's economy disappeared within 30-40 years, that had an impact that was much more severe than the impact of logging practices had been up until that point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The trees are functionally extinct.  Saplings can be bred, but the blight is a canker that affects them *almost* universally and prevents them from growing to maturity.  As u/WaxyWingie mentioned, there is ongoing research in controlled environments at some universities, but none have had any widespread success in raising saplings to adulthood.

Check out the links in my reply to /u/wigg1es, but here's a little more from the Missouri Botanical Garden:


 The significance of chestnut blight is tied to the species it decimated- the American chestnut, Castanea dentata.

 Other species that are highly susceptible to chestnut blight are the Allegheny chestnut (C. pumila), the bush chinkapin chestnut (C. alnifolia) and the European chestnut (C. sativa). The last species, Castanea sativa, is not native to the U.S. and is restricted here. Some oaks are host to the disease; these include live, post, scarlet and white oaks. It is also occasionally found on shagbark hickory, red maple and staghorn sumac.

 Chinese and Japanese chestnuts have shown some resistance to chestnut blight; for these Cryphonectria parasitica is a stress pathogen only. No other species of chestnut, however, has the characteristics necessary to replace the American chestnut as a forest tree or as an ornamental. The European chestnut, Castanea sativa, does share some of these characteristics, but it is also susceptible to chestnut blight and its importation into this country is restricted. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The blight that obliterated the American Chestnut is one of the most important, yet overlooked, factors in the deterioration of the Appalachian economy and the persistence of poverty in the region.

Prior to the fungus taking hold, the American Chestnut was central to the region's economy, its wood and nuts both being highly prized.  The eradication of the species abruptly severed one of the few tenuous lifelines Appalachia had to the larger national economy, further isolating it and driving up poverty rates among its people.

This is one of the saddest unknown stories of American history. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Prince William County, VA is the outer suburbs of Washington, DC.  Being a DC native, I'm pleasantly, yet extremely, surprised that his constituency in that area seems to be appropriately appalled by his use of the word, and recognize its implications.

The article mentions that PWC is one of Virginia's most diverse counties, but it doesn't mention that this is a fairly recent phenomenon, and one that is due in **large** part to an influx of Latino immigrant families into the community.  Not so many years ago, it was a far more White, blue-collar, homogeneous county.  The rapid demographic changes have brought with them (as they tend to do) a great deal of tension between the longer-term residents who tend to be older and white, and the primarily nonwhite newcomers.  The anti-immigrant sentiment that Stewart was playing to in using the word in question is quite strong among Republicans/conservatives in that county, so it's really interesting how much backlash he appears to be getting. </TEXT>

There's an ugly idea that's held by far too many people.  They believe that somehow, because they once knew (or heard a story about) a malingerer or drama queen, that all people with disabilities, mental illnesses, and other chronic and "invisible" conditions are contemptible loafers who are taking advantage of privileges and accommodations they neither need nor deserve.

Worse, it seems that individuals who feel this way also seem to have appointed themselves as judge and jury on the matter and they feel that every person who has such a condition must **prove** or affirmatively legitimize their conditions in order to be accorded the appropriate levels of respect, compassion, and accommodation.

It's one of the nastier common manifestations of the [just-world hypothesis (or fallacy)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis), and it's a really shitty way to treat people. </TEXT>

Because what many researchers now believe is that even women who can have orgasms "solely" from vaginal penetration are *actually* achieving the orgasm from indirect clitoral stimulation of the very long nerve endings that extend down and away from the clitoris, reaching behind the vaginal wall and not from the mythical and wildly popular, but wholly unproveable, "G spot."

The reality is that very, very few women can have an orgasm without any clitoral stimulation at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm no longer a young person, and it's clear my opinion is an unpopular one in this thread, but maybe it's exactly because of my older age and, therefore, different historical perspective, that I feel compelled to chime in.

To be clear, I don't use it as an umbrella term for gender and sexual minority individuals as a collective....I use it to refer to my individual sexuality, and I believe that for that purpose, the words that sound and feel most right to me are the words I should be able to use.

I wholeheartedly understand the myriad reasons why "queer" is (and long has been) controversial within the LGBTQ community.  I also have come to understand that younger generations of non-heterosexual people sometimes use the term differently from how I would.  Nevertheless, I am a 41 year-old woman who has identified as queer for a rather long time despite understanding how fraught with complications the term may be, and I would like to share my reasons for this choice.

Many of you probably know, but maybe some don't, that [the movement to reclaim "queer" away from being a slur began in the late 80s. It was a somewhat militant reaction to the AIDS crisis among a certain segment of young LGBT people at the time.](http://www.uapress.ua.edu/product/Reclaiming-Queer,5850.aspx)

I am a product of those times, and the notion of reclaiming a term that resonates with me on many levels has always been appealing.  "Queer," for me, has had other added benefits, not the least of which is accuracy and authenticity.

I am a woman who has been involved in more relationships with women than with men over the course of my life.  I have known I was sexually and romantically attracted to other women since before puberty.

OTOH, at age 17, I entered into a what ended up being a 19-year relationship-turned-marriage to a man. During the course of the marriage, we raised a child together.  During the course of the marriage, I also continued to have romantic and sexual relationships with women.

My marriage ended in divorce when I was 37. Since then, I have been not been romantically or sexually involved with any men, and I don't plan to be in the foreseeable future.

However, it would be inaccurate, inauthentic, and dishonest of me to call myself a lesbian for a variety of reasons, my past and my potential (unknown) future being 2 of them.  A third is that, truthfully, there's a lot about me *and* my sexuality -- apart from my orientation toward women -- that *is* queer in the most mundane sense of that word, and I'm perfectly OK with letting people know that.

With that said, as a kinky/non-monogamous person myself, I don't know how I feel about the idea of kinky or poly, yet **heterosexual** people, also identifying as queer.  While I understand that being a kinkster or committed to polyamory can feel very much like an orientation, my gut reaction (even if it is gatekeeping) is that there is a qualitative difference between a person's preferred relationship structure/dynamic and one's sexual orientation.  So, if I had to take a stand today, I'd say that I agree about not liking the word being used by straight people.

Ultimately, I choose to proudly, consciously, identify as queer because it still resonates to me as political affiliation and also because it is the label that I believe most accurately describes me and my sexuality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know this is just a shower thought, but here's the pedantic actual answer you probably weren't looking for:

The biggest difference is actually that in Mario, the stress is on the first syllable, and in Maria, the stress is on the middle syllable (the long 'ee' sound).

What I think you are referring to, though, is the fact that most English speakers have a tendency to use a schwa ("") in place of the "correct" vowel when pronouncing the *unstressed* syllable(s) of words.  The "" makes a neutral vowel sound that we, as native English speakers, perceive as corresponding to each of our 5 written vowels, depending on context.  This is why "Maria" sounds like "**Muh**-ree-ah" instead of "**Mah**-ree-ah."

EDIT: added final sentence to clarify. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My parents both have pretty significant mental health issues that affect their functioning in different ways.  They also had a chaotic, high-conflict separation and divorce that began when I was 7 months old and from which the ugliness lasted through my entire childhood, so there was **a lot** they both did wrong.

But, one thing that my mother, in particular, really did right was they way she approached sexuality and "body stuff" in general.  From an extremely young age, I knew that Mom wasn't going to freak out, no matter what question I asked her.  When my grandmother caught me halfheartedly masturbating at age 3 and started to have kittens about it, my mother rushed her out of the room, saying, "Nope.  You are not going to give my daughter a reason to think there is anything wrong with *any* part of her body."

There were always good books in the house that had answers to questions I might not be comfortable asking her -- and she would just silently make sure they ended up in my room, on my bookshelf.

All in all, she prepared me remarkably well for a happy, healthy sex life.

She consistently sent the message that as long as everyone involved wants to be doing it and is taking steps to prevent disease and pregnancy that sex is really fucking fantastic, and no one should make anyone feel bad about wanting to do it. </TEXT>

But unfortunately, there's no way to make the system perfect in terms of weeding out all the liars/assholes without catching some people with legitimate need in the net. So, we end up erring, legally, on the side of caution and tend to give people the benefit of the doubt (although I think the effectiveness of the system overall could probably be improved).  This is similar to the idea that our justice system knowingly is designed to allow guilty individuals to be acquitted rather than allowing innocent individuals to be convicted.

Thanks, btw, for taking the protections seriously even though a lot of guests make a mockery of them.  The people who really need their service animals appreciate you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was raised observant Jewish, but I haven't practiced in many years, so I'm not familiar with this particular technology, but:

/u/wahlburgerz is correct. Orthodox Jews are prohibited from working, which explicitly includes igniting any flame/electricity from sundown on Friday through sundown on Saturday.

One way to overcome this prohibition is to have another (non-Jewish) person handle this, or, in the alternative, to turn the oven on and leave it on for the duration of the Sabbath.

I would imagine that this setting allows some custom pre-programming, so that the oven is set to turn off overnight on Friday night, perhaps turning back on Saturday morning so breakfast can be made. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is is actually mine, too, but English is, well, funny like that. It's super non-phonetic; sometimes random letters are silent or make unusual sounds.  So, OP is right and so are you.  The 'l' in wolf *should* be pronounced, and the 'l' in salmon *should not*.

It gets even trickier when you look at words like "almond."  Most Americans now pronounce the "l," but at one time, the proper pronunciation was much like that of "salmon," with the letter being silent, and only uneducated, lower-class individuals would pronounce the word with the "l" sound.  Over time, this "uneducated" pronunciation became the accepted one.

Phew.  Sorry.  That was probably a lot more than you bargained for, but I'm currently taking a phonology and phonetics class, and these issues are fascinating to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to work in a call center providing inbound customer service; one of the only technically-related issues we dealt with was resetting passwords by phone.  This is a story about what happens when people who don't know how keyboards work call in for a password reset.

One day, as I was about an hour into what ended up being an 88 minute call with Mr. Bless-His-Heart (Mr. BHH), I was going over the password requirements for like the four-hundredth and seventy-third time, when he asked me one of the most beautifully stupid questions I have ever heard:

Me: "Your new password needs to have a minimum of 10 characters, and at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character."

Regardless of how biased you believe media to be, journalism is essential to preserving human liberty.  If you think the sources available to you are inadequate, all that means is that you have an even greater responsibility to A) educate yourself so that you are able to distinguish good information from bad and B) support good journalism so that it can again thrive.

If you genuinely don't understand why supporting and maintaining a strong, free, adversarial press is in the best interests of everyone but tyrants, I don't have the time or the patience to explain it to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What "it" are you referring to?

What monolithic "media" are you referring to?

*Some* media outlets are blatantly and egregiously feeding bullshit to the public, yes.  Such has been the case for the entire history of journalism.  That is an argument for people to be consume more news, not less, and to demand that good journalism be available.  It is the responsibility of every adult citizen to be educated enough to assess the credibility of sources and to put in the effort required to do so.

There is a reason the free press is part of our **First** Amendment; its vigorous existence is essential to preserving democracy.  If the state of the American media is unacceptable to you, attempting to to destroy it is not the appropriate course of action.  Instead, the response should be to invest in journalistic efforts that meet the desired standard, no matter who is engaging in those efforts.  Isn't that the "free market" solution most Americans cream their pants over? </TEXT>

The principles that Aristotle (and other political philosophers) laid out regarding the fundamental nature of people, our governance, and the cities we live in has nothing to do with internet access or lack thereof, or any other details of modern life.  Some characteristics of humanity are timeless and predictable.

<TEXT> That's just factually incorrect, unless you consider an earnest effort at disseminating nothing other than facts in order for the public to have access to them to be a narrative.

While it's certainly true that a great many -- I'll even concede most for the sake of argument -- media outlets are **intentionally** pushing a narrative, it's a rejection of reality to suggest that every single one is doing so, and doing so consciously, to boot.

Even if you were right, it still wouldn't alleviate you of the responsibility to filter through the bias and analyze the information to the best of your ability. </TEXT>

It's **not** fine, and that's wholeheartedly not the purpose of the electoral college.

Democracy, by its very nature, is a type of political regime that is highly susceptible to devolving into tyranny (see Aristotle's *the Politics*, not me, I didn't make this shit up, I just bothered to read it).  The most important way to ensure that it does not do this is by having a well-educated, involved, politically informed public.

Along with rights come responsibilities.  Staying informed and participating in the process are some of the most basic among them.  The fact that I have to spell this out is *heartbreaking*. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The people writing the headlines are smarter or more invested in the story than I am, but their objective is to push a point of view without any regard for truth or objectivity, not to objectively disseminate information.

It's just as naive to assert that every news source is intentionally pushing a narrative than it is to be unaware that news sources have a bias at all.

The solution is not to avoid news and current events; the solution is to put in the effort required to be an critical consumer of information.  That is, you pay attention and always skeptically assess the potential biases at play, fact-checking when necessary.

I simply don't accept the notion that it's OK to abdicate that responsibility.  Obviously, I can't stop you from choosing to do so, but as far as I'm concerned, it's definitely not something a person should brag about.

No one is better off ignoring current events.  It might be easier and less emotionally turbulent, but it's not better for you in terms of being a functional, informed, contributing member of society.  More importantly, on a larger scale, society as a whole is not better off when its citizenry is willfully ignorant. </TEXT>

How bad/toxic it might be is not really relevant.  As a (theoretically) functioning adult member of society, a person has a responsibility to pay attention to what's going on around them.  You certainly don't need to watch TV news to do that -- I don't.

Further, there's a difference between merely not paying attention and *bragging* about not paying attention.

<TEXT>   I don't want to minimize work done by teachers, 

I believe you, but a lot of people actively do.

 but the job market today is more competitive than post WW2 America. Gone are the union jobs that make enough money to own a home and retire by 50. Those just don't exist.

For better or worse, you are 100% correct about this.  However, I'll point out that -- at least in the deeply red part of the very blue state where I live -- people who come from families where those good union jobs were **blue-collar** (coal mining, steel production, etc.) feel absolutely entitled to the return of those jobs, no matter how unrealistic it might be.  There is an angry, stubborn unwillingness to admit that the prosperity enjoyed by most Americans in the post-WWII was an unsustainable blip that simply isn't coming back.  In addition, a huge part of what got our current president elected was his pandering to the wholly irrational idea that these people are correct in their delusional belief that they A) deserve to make an income that will support a family of 4 on what is actually semi-skilled labor and that B) there is any chance entire industries will ever return such jobs to the U.S. in significant numbers. Those same people, however, want to cut pay and benefits for teachers (who are objectively trained professionals) and shout loudly about how teachers don't deserve the comparatively meager pay they already receive.  The hypocrisy is stomach-turning.

 Every profession is difficult and requires people to go above and beyond, especially those that pay a decent wage.

That's also true, but it's more of a commentary on how corporatism has eroded Americans' expectations about work-life balance, not one on teaching.  If you examine how much "above and beyond" goes on across professions, I think you would find that teachers *easily* come out near the top, even *before* you consider how little they earn compared with others whose work requires similar education, training, higher order thinking, and responsibility. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm in Maryland and it *is* different here.  Our teachers work 10 months, usually from the 2nd week of August through the 3rd week of June each year. Christmas break ranges from one week - 10 days, not 2-3 weeks.  Also, it's important to remember that teachers usually work at least 2 weeks before and 1 week after the students' school year, so you shouldn't use the student school calendar as a basis to determine how many weeks teachers work.

I don't know a single teacher that doesn't acknowledge how nice it is to have substantial time off each year, but what I *have* noticed is that people far too often ignore or deny the fact that most teachers **more** than make up for any hours not worked over their summer "vacations" by the amount of uncompensated time they spend working before and after the school day, both on campus and at home.

In addition, people rarely talk about how teachers, who make comparatively little money for their work, also end up spending far more out of pocket to purchase equipment and supplies needed for their work than do people in other professions.  Sure, they can deduct those expenses on their tax returns if they itemize, but the standard deduction for teachers whose situations make itemizing inadvisable is only $250/year, when most teachers easily spend 4-5x that amount.

Maybe this wasn't true for your mother, but most teachers aren't immune to the grind you mention.  Almost every teacher I know works a part-time job during the year and/or works a summer job during that summer break you are so envious of...because they don't really make enough to live on their teacher's salary. </TEXT>

Rather (at least in the public school system), your pay depends almost entirely on what state and within that, what county, you teach in.  From there, it depends on your highest level of education attained and years of service.

Schools can suffer sanctions (such as takeover by the state) for failing to meet certain standards, but rarely is individual teacher pay impacted by such failures. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Way to cherry pick your statistics.  Massachusetts has the *highest* pay scale for teachers among all U.S. states.

It is absolutely not a "part-time job."  It is a more than full-time job for less than full-time pay in most states.

And I don't know what you think it means to "teach a curriculum," but there is so much more to education than merely being told what must be learned by the students.  Lesson planning, creating formative and summative assessments, handling discipline, differentiating instruction for students at different ability and grade levels, making accommodations and modifications for students with various disabilities, completing administrative and reporting tasks, participating in parent conferences, IEP, and 504 meetings...that's just the *beginning*.

There is so much to teaching that people don't know about, care about, or understand.  The implication that teachers somehow deserve less, not more, than they receive relative to other professions is simply wrong, and a disgraceful sign of what too many people in the U.S. have as their priorities. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Teachers typically work 10 months out of the year, not 9.  In addition, while they are required to be physically on campus for 7-8 hours per day, the average teacher either puts in several additional hours at work per day, or does an equivalent amount of work at home.  This means that in those 10 months, the average teacher works far more than the typical number of hours attributable to a full-time employee in virtually any other profession.  To top it off, very few teachers actually take a vacation during the summer months; instead, because they are barely paid a living wage, they typically work a summer job, and often a part-time job during the school year as well. </TEXT>

Because in Maryland, where I am (a state that pays its teachers relatively **well**), the starting salary for a new teacher with a bachelor's degree ranges from $41,126 - $48,528.  If you stay in the system and continue to obtain additional education, the pay does go up substantially, but it takes a looong time.  In addition, the **maximum** pay for a teacher with a PhD,regardless of years of service, ranges from $72,579 - $112,743, with the vast majority capping out in the mid-$80k's.

To give some context, teachers in most other U.S. states are envious of those who manage to get into Maryland's system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To add to this, an important indicator of how much respect a society has for a given profession is the typical remuneration for that profession.

The enormous disparity between teachers' salaries and those of other professions requiring a similar level of responsibility and professional expertise is a direct reflection of how little respect teachers actually get in the U.S...whatever lip service is paid to the contrary. </TEXT>

It's a play right out of Aristotle's *Politics*...touching on all of the 3 major ways that a tyrant maintains his rule, *i.e.*, destroy high thoughts, foment distrust among the people, and attenuate the people's capacity for action.  

It's even more sinister than appointing an enemy of public education like Betsy DeVos to head the Dept of Education or an enemy of environmental protection such as Scott Pruitt to head the EPA.

<TEXT> This was 1993.  IIRC, the "base salary" was $32/shift flat rate plus bonus for being so much over quota and/or getting people to put their contributions on a credit card.

Because it was a flat rate rather than hourly, it ended up working out to less than minimum wage when you counted all the time not spent canvassing (training/traveling/closing out). </TEXT>

<TEXT> As I've mentioned elsewhere in this thread, I only field canvassed for a few months, but I phone canvassed for the same organization for nearly 4 years.  I'm almost ashamed to admit that I was successful enough at it that they promoted me to "Phone Manager" and were in the process of training me for a Canvass Director position when I got pregnant and decided not to return after my maternity leave.  I'm pretty familiar with what's required to "git gud" here.

Yes, on most nights that simple formula of "just give them a concise rap and have a genuine conversation with them" works, but if I was being honest with myself, there were nights when -- for reasons beyond anyone's control -- it just didn't, and doesn't.  And one of the things I really grew to hate was having to pretend during close-out that a canvasser could or should always be accountable for missing quota when we all knew that wasn't always the case. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good question.

The answer is, by paying us less than minimum wage.  We got a flat daily rate, not an hourly rate, and they tricked their overwhelmingly young, nave employees into believing that it was legal for them to pay us only for the time we actually spent canvassing, not for the travel/admin/training time.

I believe the daily rate was $32 plus bonuses.  Even though quota was $120, many people routinely pulled in well over that, so that helped them stay afloat, and it was one of the big reasons they had so many ways to quickly get rid of employees who weren't making quota.

I'm not entirely clear on what you mean by "another potential 4-5 for the meeting."  I certainly didn't mean to imply that we had 4-5 hours of meetings each day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't disagree with anything you've said, with the possible exception of your last sentence.  I'm not certain that for me, the highs made up for the lows.  Tbf, I'm not certain they *didn't*, either.

I, too, as a naturally very shy, introverted person, benefited greatly from the experience and the skills I acquired through it.  24 years later, I can still rattle off the "5 basic skills" of canvassing and frequently find myself applying them in all sorts of professional and even interpersonal situations.

Like you, I was able to broaden my understanding of and empathy for people who are very unlike me.  I met some wonderful strangers along the way, and made friends and had great fun with some truly awesome, like-minded young people.

But...I left feeling pretty bad about the whole thing.  As a disclaimer, I should mention that I field canvassed for only a few months, but I phone canvassed for the same organization for almost 4 years, so maybe a lot of my experience isn't necessarily relevant to yours, but I posted elsewhere in this thread about why I feel the way I do, and I'd like to share my reasoning:

 after awhile, I became very disillusioned for a number of reasons. First, I did the math on how much of what I raised each night was going to pay my salary rather than to the organizations I was fundraising for.

 Additionally, I realized that (with some important exceptions), the groups we were calling for were the big business of the non-profit world...HRC, Rainforest Action Network, Public Citizen, etc. Sure, I cared deeply about the issues they worked on, but if I were to choose organizations that were most effective and efficient in terms of getting results and using their donors' money wisely, these would not be the groups I would choose. This makes sense, if you think about it. If a non-profit is big/bloated/bureaucratic enough to choose to contract out their fundraising, they probably aren't the leanest, most boots-on-the-ground type of group out there.

 EDIT: Forgot a really important point that /u/coachlasso [+1] just reminded me of. The place I worked for paid a flat rate per shift rather than an hourly rate. Only 4 hours of that time was actual canvassing, but another hour or more each day was pre-canvass pep rallies/training/issue briefings and then at least 15 minutes of mandatory post-canvass accounting/close out/dose of kool-aid for making or missing quota, as appropriate.

 When it was all said and done, this organization that screamed so loudly about workers' rights was paying us less than minimum wage and intentionally skirting the wage and hour laws in order to do so by paying us a flat rate instead of an hourly one. That hypocrisy left a pretty terrible taste in my mouth about the whole thing.

TL;DR: I'm really conflicted about it.  There were parts of canvassing that were fantastic and have continued to pay dividends for me; OTOH, there's a lot about the nitty gritty of canvassing that under close inspection, makes it feel less than honorable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wholeheartedly agree.  The public education/advocacy/organizing aspects of these jobs are great, and I probably would've continued indefinitely if I had been able to confine my involvement to just that aspect of the work.

But doing it to raise money dramatically changes the dynamic, especially when you do the math and begin to realize just how much of what you raise each night goes directly to paying your salary, rather than into the issue campaigns that most canvassers are genuinely passionate about.

I did field canvassing only for a few months, but I did phone canvassing for the same organization for almost 4 years.  By the end, I was sorely disillusioned with the "make a difference!" narrative these places sell in order to recruit young, idealistic employees. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lemme guess...the biggest one in the country is PIRG (Public Interest Research Group). The one I worked for wasn't them, but the model was very similar.

And yes, there is an initial 2-week training period when your job is on the line every day for not making quota.  Once you've jumped that hurdle, you basically have 2 weeks of job security at a time.  If you are under quota, on average, at the end of a 2-week period, they put you on an "action plan" (probation).  If you come in under quota for the week again during the next 6-week period (the action plan), they fire you.

Super great for morale.

<TEXT> Being poor means being willing to do fucked up things for tiny bits of money, so I've had more sucky jobs than I can count.  But the one that stands out to me most is door-to-door political fundraising/canvassing.

This was back in the early '90s.  The way it worked was you had a clipboard, a pen, a petition, and some envelopes. The whole crew would meet at the office and then pile into the 15-passenger van(s).  The supervisors would drive us out to a territory ("turf") anywhere from 10 min - 2 hours away from the office. Then, they would divide us into pairs and give each pair of canvassers a map marked with the pair's assigned turf.

IIRC, we started knocking on doors around 3:00 or 4:00 p.m. and kept at it until 8:00.  In that time, we were supposed to knock on people's doors and talk to them about whatever issue we were working on at that point (when I did my brief stint it was nursing home reform legislation).  Then, we were supposed to get the occupant to sign our petition and make a contribution (preferably check or charge) on the spot.  Our nightly quota was $120.  

If you think that people hate having telemarketers call their houses at dinnertime to ask them for money, just imagine how much they love it when those same telemarketers show up unannounced on their front doorsteps.

Between shitty weather, vicious dogs, crackheads and tweakers answering the door, people's pervasive hatred of trespassers and solicitors, and constant fear of being fired for missing my quota, "field canvassing" was definitely one of the worst jobs I've ever had. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's an extremely complicated issue, of course, but here are a couple of factors:

The nonviolent principles of MLK's movement have been, I hate to say it, over-hyped to a degree.  Much of the progress that is attributed to MLK's nonviolent philosophies and tactics should more fairly be credited (at least in part) to the more radical arm of the civil rights movement that prevailed after King's death.  This is true to a large degree because there is no way in hell we're about to teach elementary school children that Black people rising up and taking militant action is a heroic act...even if it is.  MLK's commitment to nonviolence always had the advantage of being a narrative that was pre-sanitized for your (White people's) protection, so it got a lot more play and a lot more credit than perhaps it deserved in terms of evaluating the drivers of change in the civil rights of Black Americans.

Another big reason is that it wasn't as successful as we like to tell ourselves it was.  The mainline civil rights movement didn't actually work as well as we like to think.  The overt Jim Crow laws that were toppled by Dr. King's movement, by and large, simply morphed into the military-industrial-prison complex which continues to keep a majority of Black people in this country divested of their rights and freedoms, using a method that is merely updated since the days of chattel slavery, not fundamentally different from it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're welcome.  And I understand not really wanting to know, I do.

I *am* a little militant and non-conciliatory in my stance on fighting bigotry, but I don't come by those attitudes as a result of lacking any perspective on what has been effective in the history of civil and human rights movements, especially here in the U.S.  I take the positions I do precisely because I have spent a lot of time learning about what actually works to drive social change and ensure equity.

Hint:  It's not being well-behaved.

<TEXT> I don't mean to sacrifice any sacred cows here, but you may wish to look into what is often described as the [radicalization of Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://u.osu.edu/aaascec/files/2015/01/the-radicalization-of-martin-luther-king-jr-1sekp22.pdf) that occurred during the last 3 years of his life.

By the time he was assassinated, King himself was increasingly uncertain that his strategies had managed to erode American racism in any lasting, meaningful way -- despite the seemingly substantial progress he had led.

King may have said, "Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that," but by the time a racist gunned him down at a motel in Memphis, Tennessee, even he wasn't so sure about that. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Harness that anger but control it and present your arguments in a level fashion and educate.

You mean like this post elsewhere in the thread in which I summarized some of the most relevant and distressing parts of the NAACP LDEF report and linked the full text of the report itself?

 "An unrelenting hostility toward civil rights and racial justice has been the defining feature of Jeff Sessions professional life. At each step of his legal and political career, and across a variety of issueswhether voting, criminal justice, diversity in higher education and employment, education equality, immigration, or LGBTQ rightsSessions has stood opposite the civil rights community and the principles of
fairness and equality."

  "Sessions has consistently criticized the work of civil rights organizations and the lawyers who
work for themespecially when they appear before the Judiciary Committee as nominees for judgeships or other government positions."

  "Sessions has exhibited a reflexive assumption that civil rights experience renders one unfit for government service, often referring pejoratively to nominees with the ACLU gene or the ACLU chromosome.

 "Sessions has affirmatively stood in the way of desegregating the Southern District of Alabama and placing Alabamas first African-American judge on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals."

 "Despite overwhelming evidence to the contraryincluding the detailed findings of the DOJ and federal courts across the countrySessions denies that race discrimination in voting exists."

 "From Sessions time as a federal prosecutor, two events in particular warrant further discussion: (1) Sessions selective prosecution of Black civil rights activists for legitimate voter assistance; and (2) the impact that failed prosecution has had on the political participation of racial minorities."

"Education" doesn't have to ask permission in order for to be effective.  If it did, advertising and marketing wouldn't be corporatist wet-dreams. No one has a responsibility to speak the truth in a way that makes bigots comfortable with themselves.

 I recognize that the people on the other side are not evil incarnate. 

Well, that's an awkward strawman.  No one said anything about "evil incarnate."  However, let's not whitewash the "blue collar values" that have gotten so much positive spin during the past election cycle.  I live in a deeply red county; approximately 72% of registered voters in my county voted for the current president.  The hatred and naked ugliness that exists in a day-to-day way is real and pervasive.  Where I live, racism, anti-semitism, and xenophobia are all issues I have to actually worry about.  And if I won't go so far as to characterize all people with those beliefs as "evil incarnate," I'm perfectly OK with saying that holding such beliefs (and not actively seeking to rid oneself of them) makes you a pretty shitty person.

 They just do not know any better.

I beg to differ.  A lot of it is acculturation and being steeped in environments where that thinking is commonplace, even the majority view.  But a lot of it is a choice to be hateful despite knowing better...often because fear is stronger than compassion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, I don't address your "preconceptions" because I don't think that's what's relevant here.

I *am* angry.  I won't deny that I am angry because I have every reason and every right to be, as does every American who is a member of a marginalized group or who simply cares about equity and justice.  My refutation of your point is not based on the fact that you are incorrectly sensing a certain intensity and disapproval, even harshness, in my tone and attitude.  Rather, my point is that this intensity, disapproval, and harshness A) is wholly earned and warranted by the despicable views and actions of the bigots occupying positions of power and B) does not rise to the level of hatred, bigotry, or intolerance merely because I refuse to be silent about their ugliness or because I insist that they be accountable for it.

My anger is appropriate and in direct proportion and response to the evil of institutional civil rights abridgment in this country; I will not concede that righteous indignation toward those who betray the ideal of equal protection under the law is in any way morally equivalent to their bigotry. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was just going to leave this without a response, but there was one phrase I kept thinking about:

 Honestly, you sound a little hateful

Honestly, I'm so tired of this sinister false equivalency.  **It is not hateful to call attention to someone else's bigotry or hatred or to fairly expect that they be held accountable for it.**

Asking me to "find some middle ground" with people who have not only fought in the past, but who, in many cases, continue to work in the present against my own civil rights and those of other Americans, is disrespectful to the people and communities who continue to be harmed by racist ideologies and actions.  Since his appointment as AG, Sessions has characterized the Voting Rights Act as "intrusive" and refused to commit to its full enforcement.  In addition, in direct contradiction to mountains of evidence and federal court rulings, Sessions has denied the historic racial motivations of voter ID laws.  His shitty views continue to harm people, and I won't pretend they don't.

I don't know that I'm "demonizing" Sessions, but I will not for one moment pretend that reprehensible ideas and conduct such as his deserve respect or equal air time in the public space.  They do not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What can he do?

To atone for his past behavior?  I suppose he could do pro bono legal work for the next 25 years serving communities that have been impacted by the harm his earlier work has done to them.  That would be a start...after denouncing his family's slave ownership, that is.

What can he do to make him qualified to hold the position of AG of the US? Possibly nothing, at this point.  It's not extremism to hold that there are some actions which permanently disqualify a person from holding certain positions of public trust.  The harm Sessions has caused to Black people (and other marginalized communities) through his past conduct render him unfit for the position he currently occupies.

He can apologize to and seek forgiveness from the Maker he believes should dictate so much of our social policy.  The American people owe him nothing -- especially not the position of highest law enforcement officer in the land.

And as to how "overwhelmed" he must be in facing the group shaming him, well, let's just say that in the face of the harm he has caused to people with far less power than he has, I'm not overly sympathetic.

I hear your argument about the shrill tone that you perceive among opponents of the current administration and the ideology it represents, and how this tactic is, among other things, counterproductive.

That argument is, frankly, nothing but concern trolling.  The majority of those who harbor abhorrent, bigoted views have shown they have no intention of participating in a reasoned dialog on these issues; their **hatred** is not caused by anyone's **tone**.  I'm more than a little sick of this argument. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Robert Byrd spent years working to undo the damage he knew he had done.  It is disingenuousness of the highest order for Sheffield (or you) to compare his legacy to that of Sessions.

The HuffPo article you link to basically says all the praise Sessions has earned from the Black community comes from his helping to start a single chapter of a civic organization in Mobile?  That's the political leadership of "I can't be a racist.  I have a black friend."

Further, the article concludes by discussing how groups with any credibility in the arena of civil rights are highly skeptical of any suggestion that Sessions is anything other than what his track record shows him to be.

 I do not believe you have looked into this issue with any real effort nor do I believe you are giving an honest effort towards objectivity.

You are incorrect.  I most certainly have; I just prefer more established, consequential sources such as [the NAACP's Legal Defense and Education Fund report against Sessions's confirmation as AG](http://www.naacpldf.org/files/our-work/LDF-Jefferson-Sessions-Report-in-Opposition-FINAL-1-9-2017.pdf) or even [Coretta Scott King's 1986 letter and testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee opposing Sessions's confirmation as a federal judge](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259988-Scott-King-1986-Letter-and-Testimony-Signed.html) outlining exactly how his pattern and practice of racist views and actions disqualifies him from acting as a federal judge, let alone AG.

 Rhetoric and propaganda. Please wake up, America. We are culturally rotting.

The irony is almost too rich to bear here.

Finally, there is no lynch mobbing occurring in the case of Sessions.  Please don't cheapen that term by using it to describe the very deserved public scrutiny of his past statements, actions, and qualifications.  Whatever shaming might be happening is not not only to be expected given his past record and present position, but more importantly, has been wholly earned. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's called the [just world hypothesis (or fallacy).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis)

Basically, poor people are shamed because it is psychologically more palatable to believe that people earn their lots in life. For one thing, it makes people feel more in control to think that there is a predictability and an order to why people are poor (they deserve it).  More importantly, it alleviates people's discomfort at seeing the misery of those who live in poverty.  It feels a lot less miserable to look at that reality when your psyche convinces you people are poor because they are unworthy and deficient.  If people were poor because, let's say, the system was unfair, then one's discomfort should stir an ethical person to take action for change.  It's a lot less work to just decide that people deserve what they get. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  When was the last time you publicly denounced racism?

Anytime I encounter it.  Which, I would argue, I have somewhat less of a responsibility to do than does someone who aspires to be a federal judge, or attorney general. Since you'll undoubtedly ask for specifics, the last time I am *on record* publicly calling out racism was at my place of employment approximately 6 years ago.  However, less formally, if and when I am witness to racist behavior or racist speech in day-to-day situations, I absolutely denounce such ideas and actions -- as long as it is safe to do so.

 As far as I know, you haven't.

You don't know enough, and you're wrong.

 Am I now right to assume you are a racist?

No, no you would not be.  A lot of people -- even people who look white, the way that I do -- make it a practice to actively work against racism.  It's not too much to expect from someone in a position such as the one occupied by Sessions, *especially* given the highly reproachable nature of his own record on civil rights, that he stand up and bother to clarify that he is actually doesn't approve of his own immediate family's slave ownership.

Allow me to clarify, as I wasn't precise enough in my previous statement:  I agree that, in and of themselves, family ties to people who did unspeakable things brings no shame upon a person.  I *should've* said that Sessions's failure to affirmatively denounce the slave ownership in his immediate family isn't as damning as his own record. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's brave in a couple of ways.

First, there is a tremendous social stigma around admitting that one cannot handle one's depression (or other mental health issues) alone.  This is especially the case when it comes to asking to be hospitalized.  For someone to be willing to say, "Fuck it, I don't care what people think or say about me. I need to go into the psychiatric unit for a minute and do whatever is necessary to not want to kill myself all the time" takes a lot of courage.

Secondly, people really internalize the shame that is directed toward them for having a mental health diagnosis.  A common response to this shame is to ignore/minimize how much the symptoms are affecting their day-to-day lives.  It is brave to acknowledge how much you are struggling and accept that as part of yourself so you can get better, rather than pretending it's not there/not that bad. </TEXT>

Dear Tourists:  **Kindly stand to the fucking right on metro system escalators.**  The majority of us are rushing like bats out of hell in order not to miss our transfer trains, for which we have calculated the standard razor-thin margin of error.  We would *prefer* not to have to murder you in cold blood for staring slack-jawed at the acoustic tile ceiling, but **we will** if you continue to stand on the left side of the escalator, making us late for our 8:15 staff meeting.

<TEXT> And this, kids, is why the internet is a wonderful thing, and library card catalogs are torture devices.

In my senior year of high school, my English teacher assigned "The Bear," a short story by William Faulkner that (I have since learned) was published separately but also is part of his novel *Go Down, Moses*. 

By 12th grade, I had basically run out of fucks to give about high school, but I was at least attempting to pass English, since it was the only credit I needed to graduate.  I wasn't *really* paying attention in class when the homework was assigned so I caught the name of the story, but the author...not so much.

The afternoon before we were supposed to finish reading the story, I managed to make it to my neighborhood library in an effort to find a copy of the book. Knowing that I didn't have much time before the library closed, I searched by title in the fiction section.  There it was!  I copied down the call number and hurried toward the stacks.  My fingers tracing the numbers printed along the books' spines, I finally found the one that matched the note in my hand.  I grabbed the book from the shelf and made a beeline for the checkout counter.

I got home and opened the book, figuring I would skim enough to be able to pass whatever quiz came the following day.  The first thing I noticed was that this wasn't like other reading my English teacher had ever assigned, mainly in that it was clearly written during the (then) current century.  The second thing that really struck me was when I noticed that **ohmyfuckinggod this woman is very enthusiastically giving this bear a hand job**

It was at that moment I realized there was a good chance I had ended up with a different story about a bear than the one Mrs. W had intended.  Not only am I permanently traumatized by my memories of this book, but I also failed the quiz. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or members of a group, hoping to make targets question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target's belief.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting)

The etymology is interesting:  

 The term originates in the systematic psychological manipulation of a victim by the main character in the 1938 stage play *Gas Light*, known as *Angel Street* in the United States, and the film adaptations released in 1940 and 1944. In the story, a husband attempts to convince his wife and others that she is insane by manipulating small elements of their environment and insisting that she is mistaken, remembering things incorrectly, or delusional when she points out these changes. The original title stems from the dimming of the gas lights in the house that happened when the husband was using the gas lights in the attic while searching for hidden treasure. The wife accurately notices the dimming lights and discusses the phenomenon, but the husband insists she just imagined a change in the level of illumination. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you! *This* is a perfect example of what I'm talking about.

When perks are always the norm, they turn into an expectation.  It's *amazing* how fast people in general go from grateful to entitled under such conditions, and police officers are certainly no exception.  If anything, the power they wield makes them more susceptible to believing they are owed such favors, rather than less, compared to the public as a whole.

That officer who was bullying your coworker...if she had refused him entry and then he subsequently had to respond to a call at your gym while she was working, how do you think he would treat her as the victim of a crime after their prior interaction?  Exactly.  Me, too.  (And before someone *else* wants to lecture me about what how LEOs are professionals and would never let the provision of small favors color their response to a crime, let's be clear that if he were a professional who held himself to appropriately high standards, then he wouldn't throw his weight around in order to get benefits he's not entitled to.)

When people begin to believe there is a prevalent social norm that such favors should be provided, it's a frighteningly short hop to a world in which paying protection money becomes required in order to be able to rely on the idea that if you need help and call them, the police will come help you. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  How many businesses (both private and government) take half days on Fridays?

As a state government employee over the course of 8 years -- literally **never**, unless I was charging it to my own accrued annual or personal leave.  That was simply not tolerated, period. Other employees didn't do it either, because no one would've allowed them to get away with that.


And sure, some days are short and fairly cushy and other days are long a terrible.  That's called having a job.  It's not different from anyone else's job in that way, and that's why LEOs get lots of OT -- to compensate them for those longer days.  Long days aren't a license to use work time, when you are being paid to do your *job*, to handle your personal affairs.  That's what your day off is for.  Oh, what? You didn't want to spend your day off sitting in the DMV?  **Neither did anyone else.**


And you keep going back to the fact that you have no issue with businesses handing out freebies as they see fit.  Well, it *is* a problem, but again, not my central point.  Would you care to explain exactly how using police time to do *hours* worth of personal business (it's not a "quick errand", please stop trying to minimize what's happening with word choice) is anything other than grossly unethical?

EDIT:  Yes, there *is* a "huge double standard"...*in favor of* law enforcement, which permeates virtually every aspect of living and functioning in American society.  To suggest the opposite is, frankly, ludicrous. </TEXT>

<TEXT> EDIT: u/MichaelMoore92 has already provided the very best explanation above inn this thread for how and why -- from the perspective of a former police officer -- such freebies are absolutely unethical. Check out his answer first.

 I don't see how giving a cop a free coffee or sandwich is "extremely unethical".

Among other things, it creates an incentive for police officers to be more attentive to those business/individuals who have "helped" them when it comes to preventing/responding to crime--and less attentive to those who haven't given them freebies.  That's unethical because it puts other members of the public at a disadvantage in terms of the policing they receive.  It also encourages LEOs to selectively choose not to enforce the law -- like how my trainer (who told me to bump them to the front of the line) *never* got a ticket when she would get pulled over, because they all "knew" her.

But really, the point of my post wasn't the little freebies.  It was the DMV thing.  The reason that *some* police don't get regular breaks/lunches is because a LOT of them have the freedom to set their own schedules and take breaks whenever they want/aren't responding to an incident.  They find *plenty* of time to eat.  I'm not sure why you're OK with police using work time to do personal errands, but I'm absolutely not.  I can't decide to take a 2-hour lunch and charge it to my employer while I get my car detailed or see the dentist.  It's not treating anyone like a "slave" to suggest that they do personal business on personal, not work, time -- just like every other employed American.  There is no reason whatsoever that police should be permitted to get paid (using taxpayer dollars!) to handle personal business.  That's not what their salary is for, and what they are doing has a name: it's theft of time -- a crime for which my state not only dismisses, but also prosecutes, employees *other than LEOs* for engaging in that conduct.

It's a disgusting, unethical double standard. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's an useless platitude that is so overly simplistic as to be utterly meaningless.  It makes me think you didn't understand what I said.  Here, I'll try again:

I didn't say all police officers are evil.  I said it is unethical for them to accept favors and special treatment from the general public.  They are civil servants just like the people behind the desk at the DMV.  It is the *definition* of unethical to allow police to engage in theft of time from their employers (and therefore the taxpayers) in order to do personal business.

<TEXT> *Could be* any of those things, sure.  In practice, during the 8 years I worked there, this was seldom, if ever, the case.  How do I know?  Because officers would talk about it at the counter with little to no prompting...so I got in the habit of finding out.  The officer in question in the story above was, in fact, on duty.

 If they ARE on duty, it makes even more sense to let them skip the line if you are concerned about tax dollars considering that they'd be staying in line for hours.

I'm sorry...what?  No, that's not how it works at all.  A police officer can schedule his trip to the DMV on one of his days off (which, as a uniformed officer, he is *more* likely to be able to do than someone working Monday-Friday 9-5, since he likely has at least 1 weekday off), or if absolutely necessary, he can request time off to complete personal business.  You know...like all the rest of us do?

Under no circumstance should he be permitted to conduct personal errands on police time.  Just because he -- as a law enforcement officer -- doesn't understand that **stealing time** from one's employer is wrong doesn't mean that anyone should condone or facilitate that egregious conduct. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Providing free goods and services and offering "perks" that other customers don't get to police officers.  Worse, when police officers expect/believe they are entitled to special treatment.

It happens all the time...free coffee, free donuts, extra sides slipped in to their sandwich orders, cashiers at customer service and pharmacy desks ringing up their purchases when "closed" to others...on and on and on.  But what's the problem?  Police provide a valuable public service and they protect all of us, right? Why should I care if they get some perks from the grateful community?

I used to work for my state's department of motor vehicles.  When I first started there, the woman who trained me told me very clearly:  "When an officer in uniform comes in here, we have an unwritten policy that he goes to the front of the line.  It's professional courtesy.  They help us and we help them."  At first, I just nodded and took note of her instructions, but as I stood there watching the officer in uniform at the counter, getting assistance before a huge room *full* of other people who had been waiting for hours, it occurred to me...that's some unethical fucking bullshit right there.

Not only is he getting pushed ahead of everyone else who has followed the rules and waited their turns, if he's in uniform in my building at 2:20 in the afternoon, then **he's on duty and being paid a salary to do personal business at the DMV at taxpayer expense.**

It's bullshit, and as soon as I thought it through, I told my (former) trainer that unless that "unwritten policy" became a written one, she should expect me not to comply with it. </TEXT>

Your father really *should* understand that since you're 18 now, he doesn't get to have it both ways:  either he can treat you as a child and expect you to follow the rules he makes -- which means you get to be a child and not work/pay rent, OR, he accepts that you are an adult and therefore get the full set of adult rights *and* responsibilities.  However, **you should not waste your time/breath/effort attempting to teach/convince him of this**.  What's important is for *you* to understand that it's not OK for him to use manipulation or intimidation to cause you to act against your own best interest.

Please know that I say this not as some pie-in-the-sky, "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" bullshit; I say this because my parents were super fucked up and I had to do the same thing at basically your age.

You're worthy of keeping this thing that has intrinsic value and is rewarding to you, never mind being productive, economically profitable, and beneficial for future career growth.

Bottom line: You're right, your father is wrong, and "I said so" is a ridiculous, bullshit reason for him to 'win' this dispute with.  All you need to do is figure out what steps you have to take so you can be independent and not have to deal with such ridiculousness.  You got this. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I won't sit here and say I've never had a racist thought in my life, after all I'm only human. But I'd never degrade a person because of religious beliefs/ethnicity in a way that affects them personally.

I think that's what we call the difference between being human and being a contemptible piece of shit.

The truth is, every single human being harbors some form of ingroup/outgroup bias.  If nothing else, we all have some degree of implicit bias in favor of our "own" group and bias against certain subgroups of people based on these (very provable) phenomena.

When confronted with this reality, racists, xenophobes, and other bigots use the fact that it is ubiquitous as a way to excuse and rationalize their hatred and fear; better people seek do what you're talking about, which is A) not act on those thoughts, and B) when you have them, examine them critically -- aka, "don't believe everything you think." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think you understood my comment at all.

First, a big part of my point was that from ages 0 - 13, I never experienced antisemitism, nor did I experience any that made me fearful from ages 14 - over 40.  And that when I  *did* experience it, the event was so jarring that it stuck with me for decades.  So, your assertion that I should be "pro-Israel" based on "all the antisemitism" is not consistent with my story.

Another part of my point was that even though I was raised in a very pro-Israel, somewhat insular Jewish community that was *overwhelmingly* Zionist, I, personally, never was...for a variety of reasons that are not the point here but that have a lot to do with the idea that A) 2 wrongs don't make a right and B) that systematically shitting on people is a pretty poor foundation for a "holy land."

Many elements of Zionist ideology/policy have always struck me as lacking internal coherence...What I'm saying is that *despite* the fact that I still feel this way, the level of antisemitism that is visible and accepted in the U.S. has risen so markedly over the past few months that I am seriously examining whether I am safe in the community where I live and wondering whether Israel, will all of its warts, wouldn't be a better option.

  Maybe it was always there and just now people are blaming it on Trump? 

It *was* always here...in a latent form that would occasionally bubble over.  The difference is that being openly antisemitic was socially unacceptable in most places in the U.S. **As it fucking should be**.  Do people have a right to feel/believe whatever fucked up bigoted thing they want?  Sure.  Do I, as an individual, and my community, as a whole, have the right to apply social pressure (what academics call informal social control) to signal that those beliefs, and especially acting on those beliefs, is abhorrent?  You better fucking believe it.

Now, however, those who have held those latent bigoted opinions are emboldened to openly express their hatefulness.  The fact that this newly found "courage" to express these vile beliefs comes on the heels of the election of the current president is no coincidence.  He didn't create the hatred that exists in the U.S., but his rise to power, despite, perhaps even *because* of, his own bigoted beliefs, has made it acceptable, almost fashionable. </TEXT>

My major is (interdisciplinary) social science, with concentrations in political science and geography.  Sort of by accident, I have a triple minor in Spanish, international studies and cultural anthropology.

I have absolutely loved being in college as an adult and 3 months from graduation, I would select my chosen program all over again.  By starting at my local community college and then transferring to a very inexpensive state university, I have been able to study exactly what is important and valuable to me without worrying about being buried under massive student loan debt come graduation.

Prior to returning to school, I worked in state government for 8 years, but was unable to advance further without a degree.  When I graduate in May, my intention is to either return to state government (where I am vested in the pension system) in a higher graded position or, to return to the legal or nonprofit fields, in which I also have substantial experience. </TEXT>

The very best thing about hockey, at least at first, was that it is sooo much fun to watch.  You don't have to know a single thing about the game to enjoy watching it, and once you start watching, it won't take you long to figure things out...at least well enough to feel like you know what's going on.

I agree with the family thing, too.  With the exception of a handful of "magic hockey helmet" type parents, the vast majority of hockey people have been enormously welcoming, friendly, and helpful...it's like they love the game so much, they just want to share it with everyone around them.

I grew up in a football house, but I'd rather watch hockey almost any day. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Jews have been able to assume immense white privilege in this country and because of this, I feel, anti-Semitism has been given a pass because Jews are presumably white and rich.

This is spot on.

I would add that the amount of passing-as-white-privilege enjoyed by the average American Jew is anything but inconsequential, which creates an...interesting sort of tension between us and other historically marginalized communities.  There's always some element of "crabs in a barrel" when talking about inter-minority relations (witness the crazy tensions between Black and Latino people in this country), but the tenor of this strained relationship is qualitatively different when it comes to the Jewish community. I definitely think this has to do with an unspoken idea that the economic advantages enjoyed by many (but not all!) American Jews turns any antisemitic words or deeds into a form of punching up...which is culturally acceptable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK, so I was halfheartedly trying to keep the subtext of my comment as subtext, but yes.  Exactly that.

I grew up in a large suburb of Washington, DC, in an area with a sizable Jewish population.  As a child, I was lucky to be insulated from most antisemitism; my mother had to apply for a scholarship for me to attend a private Jewish school (because, despite rumors to the contrary, we *aren't* all rich), but she did that because she had seen more than her fair share of prejudice and nastiness when she attended the very same neighborhood public schools growing up.  My very first encounter with people who were actually prejudiced against *me* (mind. blown.) occurred when I began public school in 8th grade.  Most of the comments were just ignorant -- usually not malicious, but sometimes hilarious in the profundity of the lack of knowledge they belied.  I legit had more than one kid me where my tail was -- and at *least* one of them was dead fucking serious. He was more than a touch concerned -- like I had lost it in a horrific industrial tail-lopping accident.  Since I had never seen bigotry against Jewish people before, I had no reason not to assume good faith from them, and while I was sometimes confused by how little they seemed to understand, there was no reason for me to be *scared* of them.

But there was one incident that taught me that antisemitism comes in forms other than uninformed foolishness.  In classic middle school fashion, another girl decided on the very first day of school that she didn't like the cut of my jib.  A few weeks later, when she could no longer contain her need to remind everyone that she was top bitch, she ambushed me with a group of her friends in the PE locker room.  As she pushed me up against the wall, one of her friends grabbed my hair, and started knocking my head back into the cinder block.  It wasn't the searing pain in my skull that grabbed my attention, though.  It was the venom in her voice as she hissed that I was a "**dirty kike**" who had "better stop acting like you're somebody, 'cuz you ain't shit."

I now live in a much more rural area, about 3 hours away from home, in a deeply red county.  Over the past 4 months, for the first time since I was a child, there have been several occasions when I have been legitimately fearful about my safety because of my Jewishness.  The multiple incidences of Jewish cemetery desecration in major cities are chilling...but so are the hateful graffiti and flyers that went up all over my campus on election night.  So is the fact that 4 days after the election, a local man in my town walked up to a black woman standing in line at the register at Walmart, put his items on the belt in front of hers, looked at her and said, "I'm first.  You're gonna wanna get used to that now."

I was raised steeped in Jewish culture and I received formal religious education from the age of 3 onward, but since I was old enough to be aware of the issue, I have had *serious* problems with Zionism.  The past several weeks are literally the first time in my life I have ever considered claiming my birthright, if that gives you any idea of how bad I think things are likely to get.

It used to be a feminine counterpart to a drum major.  They often march at the front of parades with the marching band. (For the good ones), their performance involves some pretty neat twirling and tossing of batons in intricately choreographed routines.  At my high school, they typically had a few-minute routine of their own during the halftime show.

The cheerleaders and poms were merciless to them, though...there was a distinct, strictly enforced hierarchy of sport-auxiliary activities, and the only ones below the majorettes in terms of status were the poor flag girls.

I'm a 40-something college student who lives in a small college town.  My  experience, both here and 20-ish years of living in and around College Park, is that liquor stores are *more* strict in college towns with respect to vertical IDs, not less, because the incidents of attempted fraud/purchase by minors is so much greater in those areas.

Certainly, though, this is much like anything else...highly variable from individual location to individual location, and OP could luck out if the climate in his college town is pretty chill.  My only real point was that it's policy, not law (in most places), that drives liquor stores' refusals to sell to people with vertical IDs, and that's because the civil/administrative penalties hurt **a lot**. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Jesus tastes like chicken." Nice one.

I have a similar tale.  In my junior year, several students developed a suspicion that our world history teacher wasn't reading our papers, either, but rather, handing out grades based on who he *thought* was a good student.

A good friend of mine sat next to me in his class; the teacher liked me because I was typically quiet and studious (read: nerdy), but was not a fan of hers because she was a majorette (and therefore, obviously an airhead).

So we decided to test the theory. She and I wrote identical papers, but I inserted a chocolate chip cookie recipe in the middle of one of my body paragraphs.

She got a B- and I got an A.

<TEXT> Every state's law is different, but it's unlikely that the state where you go to school has any overt legal prohibition against selling alcohol to a person with an under 21 ID.

The much bigger (and more common) issue is that most places that sell liquor have a strict *policy* not to sell to anyone with an under 21 ID, *especially* an out-of-state vertical ID, simply because it's just too much of a risk to take.  A single sale to a minor can cost the clerk *personally* over $10,000.  So even though they technically *can* take it, they won't. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems like you've been really on the ball about taking the necessary steps to get yourself out of a bad situation you didn't put yourself into.  Impressively resourceful for someone as young as you are.

I'm sorry I don't have other advice to give; I'm really not familiar with resources that might be available in Canada. But I second the suggestion to look up local food banks.  

Wait...I just had a thought...is there a counseling/psychological services office on your campus? Or a student resource center?  I know that at both schools I have attended, they have had emergency food assistance and emergency grants/scholarships to students who had unforeseen emergencies arise mid-semester.  You may want to check and see if there are any resources on campus for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC or Independence Hall in Philadelphia, PA.

The diversity and quality of the Smithsonian museums (and the National Zoological Park, which is part of the Smithsonian) are world-class; the fact that they remain free to the public is nothing short of a miracle.  If you've never been, you're missing out.

Similarly, Philadelphia should not be missed. There is no better way to be immersed in early American history than to visit Independence Hall and stand in the room where the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were signed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In addition to the (very good) suggestions to seek out a local food bank, you should also be aware that you may be eligible for **emergency** supplemental nutrition assistance (SNAP) (aka food stamp)  benefits. If your shelter and food expenses exceed your income, you will likely qualify. A caveat to be aware of is that as a college student (in most, if not all states) you have to work a minimum of 20 hours per week to be eligible for SNAP assistance.  However, since you were just hired, there is a wage verification form they should be able to use (your employer completes it) rather than having you submit pay stubs.

Even if you won't be eligible for long, you need food now.  *Please* ask for the help that's available to you; that's why it's there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ugh.  I have a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach reading your story; it hits far too close to home.  I am so sorry you have reached a point where you feel like you have to make this choice.

You're not crazy.  It sounds like you have given this more than adequate reflection, and in a way that is far more dispassionate than I, certainly, was able to be in a similar situation.

While it's true that it's not OK to demand of another person that she come out, or for you to dictate when it must happen, it is also true that you have an absolute right to not be treated like your partner's dirty little secret. For me, my ex-girlfriend's unwillingness to acknowledge the nature of our relationship to her parents or our co-workers (after 7 years!) was incredibly invalidating, humiliating, hurtful, and ultimately, infuriating.

The fact that your girlfriend established a timeline for telling her brother and then made (half-assed) excuses for why she didn't honor her word is of particular concern to me.

You ask a number of really good questions:

 I feel like maybe she cant get the words out because deep down, she isnt sure she wants to be with me, or isnt sure she wants to marry another woman.

and 

 Is it working out her own hesitation about marrying a woman and losing all the hetero-privilege? 

In my situation, there was absolutely an element of both of these issues.  And it was sad, because I knew that she would end up living a life that was far less authentic and joyful than the one she might have, just so that she could maintain her privilege.  But eventually, my sadness about it turned to contempt.  Because, frankly, to cultivate one's invisibility so that one can avoid having to stand up as a member of a marginalized group or speak out against bigotry is an act that belies a profound lack of integrity.  And no matter how great she and I were together in so many other ways, I don't want to spend my future with someone whose values are so very different from mine.

Again, I don't think you are being in any way crazy or unreasonable about your plan to end the relationship.  It sounds like you are a really thoughtful, special person, and you deserve a life partner who is bursting with pride over you -- a girl who wants to shout from the rooftops about how much she loves you.  You're worth that.  All of us are. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. That's not what happens at all.[This NYT article describes what really happens when you insert a profit motive into the education of young children.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/us/for-detroits-children-more-school-choice-but-not-better-schools.html?_r=0) Bonus: It profiles Michigan, where DeVos has already had an opportunity to demonstrate what a miserable failure her charter plan is.

I've noticed a theme in your comments throughout this thread, so I recognize that "competition" and "free market" are ideological, almost religious, concepts to you. That means I'm probably wasting my breath, but I'll point out that there are absolutely industries/sectors of the economy where (typically for reasons of ethics, the public good, or both), public endeavors are not only inherently better than private ones, but in some cases are the only ethical means of providing a good or service to all who require it.  Public education is one such area (as are prisons, for example). 

Your kneejerk hatred of teachers' unions and willingness to paint all of them with the same broad, tarry brush is both unwarranted and telling.  While it's true that most unions have some degree of problem with working too diligently to retain sub-par teachers, that represents a tiny portion of what teachers' unions actually spend their time working on.  Teachers are professionals and the vast majority of them work their asses off at it for meager pay.  It is absolutely vital that so long as this toxic strain of anti-intellectualism and contempt for education persists in the U.S. that teachers continue to have the means to bargain collectively and speak in a united voice. 

Experience shows us (charter schools have been operating in earnest since the late '80s/early '90s) that what actually happens when you set up "school choice" is that a number of predictable and negative outcomes occur:

1. They are taken over by for-profit "education" companies that place profit over the quality of education provided to students.  They are run by people with business, not education degrees, and it is evident in the 'instruction' that occurs under their management.  The problem is that "businesspeople" are often loathe to admit, much less respect, the fact that education is an actual profession, one which requires expertise about a very particular set of things, not the least of which is the most effective, developmentally appropriate methods for teaching. I'll point out that what is being "produced" here are not widgets, but **children** who will (hopefully) become competent, contributing members of society.  It should also be noted that **the market often doesn't work here** because the consumers (parents) are not equipped to evaluate the substandard performance of the school.

2. Charter schools are often exempted from or subject to less stringent standards than those applied to public schools, meaning that there is often no meaningful way to even substantiate malfeasance until a great deal of harm has been done over the course of many years.

3. The profit motive leads to an alarmingly high rate of scandals and kickbacks within the charter school/private educational company industry that has cropped up since charter school legislation began to be enacted.  [Scandal after scandal after scandal.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/09/09/how-messed-up-is-californias-charter-school-sector-you-wont-believe-how-much/?utm_term=.1515e42c1eb8)

TL; DR:  While there are certainly exceptions, charter schools are overwhelmingly a bad choice for the majority of children, and a number of systemic flaws make charter schools ripe for corruption and poor educational quality. </TEXT>

Now, with that said, there is a point that should be stressed: acetaminophen (aka Tylenol) can cause liver toxicity on its own in too-high dosages, and is exacerbated by alcohol consumption, so **acetaminophen (aka Tylenol) should never be taken when you have had 3 or more alcoholic drinks in a sitting**. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As I'm well aware, but those who do are typically quite strict about how they interpret the kashrut requirements during that period. Much more strict than the average observant Jew who keeps kosher year-round.

My family kept kosher only inside the house, but not at restaurants (religion isn't logical), but during Passover, we weren't permitted the cheat of eating out. Because unless you're going to a specifically kosher establishment, it's not actually possible to obtain kosher food, let alone kosher-for-Passover food, from a commercial kitchen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've posted this here before, but it's one of my favorite wtf moments from working in food service.

 I managed a small independent caf/coffeeshop. I was working the breakfast/lunch shift one afternoon, and a woman entered and approached the register. She explained that she needed some assistance finding lunch that would work with her dietary restrictions. We'll call her crazy caf lady (CCL).


 "Sure thing!" I said, since I was very accustomed to catering to special snowflakes with extra-special requests, and since I knew we had options to satisfy most of the common issues: We had tons of vegetarian and vegan food, organic options, gluten-free options...it was the kind of neighborhood where such things were considered "necessary" by a substantial segment of customers.


 CCL: "Well, I'm a vegetarian."


 "No problem!" I reply. "The majority of our menu is vegan and vegetarian."


 CCL continues: "And it's Passover, of course, so I need something that contains no leavening or grain products."


 Me (internally): *Ummm...I was raised Jewish and if you're actually concerned about keeping kosher, anywhere other than your Bubby's house is the wrong place to be, but OK....let's see where this ends up...*

 CCL: "And most importantly, I'm allergic to nightshades."

 Me: "Oh, like the whole family? Just to be clear, you can't eat tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, or any kind of peppers?"

 CCL: "Exactly."

 Me: "I'm afraid I have very little in the way of standard menu items to offer you that would meet your needs. Can I offer to make you a tossed salad or a fruit salad?"

 CCL: "No, I don't want just a snack. I really wanted something hearty for lunch."

 Me: blink *Are you fucking kidding me? This bitch thinks I'm hiding "hearty" kosher-for-Passover vegetarian nightshade-free food back here?*

 She kept at it for another solid 5 minutes, like her whining was going to cause matzah brei to materialize out of thin air. Eventually, I managed to get across the idea that she might be better off to come visit us another day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm in my 40s now, and while I can still party like a rock star, what I *can't* do anymore is get up and function the next day.

So sure, I'll come out with you on Friday night...as long as I can do nothing but lay in bed and reflect on how torn up my old ass is on Saturday.

EDIT:  Judging by my inbox, this will come as a surprise to many of you, but over the course of my 40+ years, I have actually encountered several pieces of wisdom about how to avoid wishing for death the day after partying hard.  Over-hydrating, taking ibuprofen before bed, and making sure you've eaten aren't exactly secret wisdom; please stop telling me to drink water. My entire point was that at 19 none of that shit was necessary, at 26 it helped, but now that I'm over 40, it doesn't fucking matter.  </TEXT>

It's an interactive "crossword" puzzle site...I use scare quotes because the clues are not arranged in a traditional grid. I really like it though, because it's pretty smart and adapts the puzzles to your skill level. You have a handicap number just like golf, and it changes based on your performance. There are several new puzzles each day, some news-themed, others vocabulary building.

I know I'm distinctly in the minority with respect to loving crosswords, but if you're a person who does too, this site is pretty great. </TEXT>

This one, at a minimum, was *not* Lincoln.  The sentiment originally appears in Western literature in the Bible in Proverbs 17:28:

"Even a fool is thought wise if he keeps silent, and discerning if he holds his tongue."

The modern iteration isn't Lincoln's either, though. It's also widely misattributed to Twain and many others, but [it was probably first seen in Maurice Switzer's 1907 Mother Goose book.](http://mentalfloss.com/article/63002/9-popular-quotes-commonly-misattributed-abe-lincoln) </TEXT>

I had been feeling pretty terrible for a couple of days and thought I was coming down with the flu. My head hurt really bad, so I started walking into the living room to tell my son to put his headphones on because I was going to bed.

The last thing I remember is him asking me, "Mom, are you OK?" and then I remember waking up face down on the floor what I'm told is about 7 minutes later.

A friend of mine drove me to the hospital where they did a kajillion tests -- including a fucking spinal tap -- and never figured out exactly what was wrong. My discharge papers say "viral infection, other." </TEXT>

But if you choose to care about shallow, meaningless things instead of putting effort into understanding important things that really affect us, that says something about your priorities.

Even if you don't start writing letters to your representatives, at least you'll know how to make an informed choice the next time you go vote.

And it's not about being an expert on Syria.  It's about a) understanding that one of these topics is important and the other is *not*, and b) being willing to engage in what's going on in the real world around you rather than investing energy in things that are hollow and devoid of any substance or redeeming value. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [x-post from /r/actuallesbians, if you're wondering why this looks familiar.]

I'm in my early 40s. My last relationship ended nearly 5 years ago, when my girlfriend and I broke up a few months after my (polyamorous, 19-year long) marriage (of which she was a part) ended.

Apart from my ex-husband, the majority of my romantic and sexual relationships of any importance have been with women, and I'm even less interested in men now than I was before my divorce.  I mention this only because...well, because I'm a little gunshy from experiences with women who want to label me as straight because I was at one point married to a man.

For a looong time after the separation and the subsequent break up with my girlfriend, I was totally shell-shocked and uninterested in trying to date at all. But over the past several weeks, I've found more and more that my thoughts are turning to how nice it would be to share my life with someone special again. The problem is, I haven't the first clue how to begin.

I was partnered by 1992, so I never learned how to do the whole online dating thing at all. And now, I just feel awkward and clueless.

I don't even really know what I'm asking for here...advice? help? for you to share your experiences?

I just...it's finally hitting me that I've been alone for 5 years, and I'd really kinda like to change that, but I don't know how.  Would you be willing to share your suggestions, stories, tips, cautionary tales, and creative ideas please? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi.

The new semester just started and my laptop just died (its fan is no more...also, I was thinking about getting a new computer this semester anyway, sooo...).  I'm just feeling a little overwhelmed by my options and could really use some advice.

* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
$400; USA

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
 Toss-up between specs and battery life. I'm an adult full-time college student, so a longer battery life is nice for extended use on campus, *buuut*, I'd rather just plug into an outlet than have a PC that struggles to work with PowerPoint and Word at the same time.

* **How important is weight to you?**
 Eh. Not super important, I guess...I'm already lugging around a heavy-ass bag...another couple of pounds probably doesn't matter that much.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
 Windows (10). I won't run 8 ever again, and going back to 7 at this point makes compatibility difficult for certain things on my campus.

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
 15.6", mainly because I have a strong preference for a keyboard that contains a number pad and it's impossible to find those on smaller laptops.

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
 No CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming, but I have to use PowerPoint a lot, which, when run at the same time as other MS Office applications, causes my current machine to groan and freeze up. Other than that, I use it for word processing, web browsing, and watching Netflix.

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
 N/A

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
 As I mentioned above, I *really* want a number pad...I study foreign languages and need to be able to use [Alt] + [number] combinations to create non-English characters quickly in text.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
 My laptop gets significant daily use. It is my only computer and it travels back and forth with me between home, work, and school, so it needs to be durable and good quality.  I don't have a lot of money to invest, I know, but I need to get as much good quality computer for my price range as possible, because this is going to be the primary tool I use on a daily basis for (hopefully) the next several years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 4 doors.

She does need cargo space - she owns and runs a small business and often has to haul medium-large loads of whatever. Passenger seating is less of an issue...standard 2-row SUV seating is fine.

She really wants to remain high up,  so a truck or SUV is probably the solution. For reference, I drive an '06 Subaru Forester, and she felt like it was a little too low and small for her needs.

She **strongly** prefers manual transmissions, but knows that this may be unrealistic.

It would really be nice if the thing could get at least 20mpg.

This car will be used for both daily commuting and utility. As a small business owner, and a new homeowner doing renovations, she's constantly hauling all kinds of stuff around.

Top of her budget is $24k, and she'd be happiest with an older vehicle that's better quality for the money, as opposed to a newerm but less reliable vehicle, *especially* if going to an older car gets her back into the era of manual transmissions being a thing.

Last, she's biased toward imports...but if you folks have good suggestions for domestics, I can probably reason with her on that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know if this will make you guys want to facepalm as hard as I did, since I guess the story is a bit specific to the fact that I work in call center that handles retirement investment accounts, but I'm guessing most of you folks will get why I'm still shaking my damn head over a call I had on last night's shift.

As I mentioned, I work in a call center that services retirement accounts.  Among the many things account holders can do is transfer funds from other eligible retirement/employer plans (like 401(k)s and IRAs) into their accounts with us.

In order to do this type of transfer, 2 items are required: a form that needs to be filled out by both the account holder and the financial institution sending the funds, and a transfer check for whatever amount is being deposited.

A guy calls in to check on the status of a transfer request he says he has submitted (he'll be GC for "genius customer" and I'll be "me").  At first glance, I don't see that we've had anything come in, so I ask him to hold while I look through another part of the system.  I look, see nothing other than a note saying he had called in a couple of weeks ago and another rep gave him instructions on how to complete the transfer process.  But we haven't received anything from him, neither form nor check.

So I return to the line, thank him for holding, and tell him that I'm not yet showing any indication that the request has been received, but that it can sometimes take a few business days for us to be able to see submissions once they are received. I was getting ready to suggest that he simply call back on Monday or Tuesday so we could check status for him again when he said:

GC: "That doesn't make any sense. I faxed the form **and the check** on Wednesday.  They should be there by now."

Ummm...Wat?

Me: "I'm sorry, sir, did you say that you *faxed* the check to us?"

GC (exasperatedly):  "Yes, yes! I faxed the form and the check together on Wednesday.  There's no reason they shouldn't be there already."

Me: "Well, I think I may be able to offer you an explanation about why I'm not seeing anything in the system.  You see, sir, when a transfer is requested, we must receive the physical check in our office in order to process it."

GC: "What do mean? I can't fax you the check?"

Me (flipping up my mic over my head and stifling my mouth with my hand so he won't hear me laughing hysterically at him because our phones have no mute button): "Unfortunately, no, sir.  We are not able to process a faxed check image in order to effect a transfer into your account in the amount of several hundred thousand dollars. Do you still have the original check that was issued by the other plan?"

GC: "Of course!"

Me: "Excellent.  Allow me to suggest that, at your earliest convenience, you resubmit both the form and the original check *by postal mail* to us at the following address.  Once we receive both required items, we will be glad to process your transfer. Is there anything else I can help you with this evening?" </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm an older, nontraditional student who transferred from a community college to a state university in Fall 2015. I  had a 3.76 GPA at my CC, and I'm a senior with a 4.0 institutional GPA at my current school. I say this not to brag, but to establish that I am not a wholly incapable student.

I am currently taking a 300-level political science class that is **kicking. my. ass.** 

I understand the concepts, and I feel perfectly competent participating in class discussions, but I am really scared about the volume and depth of information my professor expects us to regurgitate *and* analyze in less than an hour's time for our 4 exams, which are basically our entire grade.


I have the first exam of the semester tomorrow. He gave us a study guide, and I'm terrified. There are 23 vocabulary terms/concepts that we have to be able to define/identify/explain the significance of. Out of those, we will be given 4 of the 23 from the list, and we have to pick 2 to explain.

Then, there are 5 possible essays, out of which we will be given 2 to choose from, and have to respond to one. To be fair, he was kind enough to tell us exactly what all 5 of them are, but shit. I've been sitting here trying to draft responses to all 5, and I'll be lucky to have enough minutes to even write out the answers in the 50 minutes we'll have, let alone worry about remembering what the fuck my answers *are*. 

The essay questions are the kind of questions that really need a 5 page response to be adequately addressed. I can't imagine how I'm going to have time to get a complete response out in the time allotted, even if my brain doesn't go blank from sheer terror.

Look, I'm not trying to be a whiny baby, and I don't really want to get into the whole "try being a STEM major and taking our exams" derailment. I accept that college is supposed to be difficult. Maybe this is normal and I just have somehow weirdly missed having any other classes like this?

I don't know...I'm just feeling really confused and frustrated. Anyone have any thoughts? Your input would be very much appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, /r/AskAcademia! I just found this sub, and I really wish I had known you were here before. I posted the following very long series of questions and thoughts to /r/gradadmissions about a month ago, but I got only one reply. Having now found this sub, I was hoping some of you might be willing to weigh in. 

Im very new to this process of grad school admissions, and I'm feeling extremely rushed, lost, and generally overwhelmed. I am sorry this is so long, and I truly thank you for taking the time to read this post. I have tons of swirling thoughts and questionsso many that Im having difficulty organizing them in a coherent way, but here goes:
Up until just a few weeks ago, I thought grad school was in my distant future. Due to some unforeseen circumstances, my graduation date has been pushed up a full year  to May 2017  and my new Plan A involves continuing immediately into a graduate program the following fall.

About me, my interests, and my goals:

 Since it might be relevant in ways I am unaware of, Ill mention that I am (at least by reddits standards) old. I turn 41 soon and didnt really give college a good, old-fashioned college try until I was 38. I dont know how, exactly, but I suspect that my age in some way does (or should?) affect this process.

 I will graduate with a B.S. in Social Science (concentrations in political science and geography) with minors in Spanish and Cultural Anthropology. I speak Spanish fluently, so I have no fear of graduate foreign language requirements.

 Since I returned to school in the fall of 2013, my overall GPA is 3.859. However, over 20 years ago, when I was 18-19 years old, I had 2 spectacularly awful semesters at the University of Maryland. The effect of these 2 semesters is that my current cumulative GPA is actually 3.202. By the time I graduate a year from now, I can have it up to 3.407, but unless I make changes to my proposed undergrad program/timetable, I cant get it all the way to a 3.5.

 I attend a small state university that is improving, but that is generally unknown and that tends to have a mediocre reputation among those with an opinion. Lets just say that my primary criterion for choosing an undergraduate program was affordability and maximizing transferability of credits from my associates degree, so at the time, choosing an inexpensive state school with a seamless transfer process made sense  especially when the (old) goal was just to finish my stinking bachelors degree. Now Im worried about how the lackluster reputation of the school might tarnish how my otherwise pretty decent (recent) academic performance is viewed.

 I am open to the idea of relocating to a wide variety of places for the duration of my program.

 I have to find a fully funded program. Paying for grad school is not an option for me. My EFC on this years FAFSA was $0, and until I have a graduate degree, my earning capacity likely wont be much better than it is right now. In addition, Ive been humping it nonstop since August 2013, working full-time and attending school full-time. I cant do it anymore. If Im to finish a graduate program, I have to be able to stop working 35 hours/week on non-school related stuff.

 Ultimately, I would like to teach in a social science field, probably political science, (I think, please see last question below) at a small teaching college. I really dont want to put down long-term roots in a publish-or-perish environment.
My questions:

 What type of graduate programs are going to best position me to get the kind of teaching placements I really want? Am I a realistic candidate for those schools?

 How competitive should the schools I apply to be? Does my drastically improved recent performance make any difference in terms of admissions cutoffs for minimum GPA?

 How do I account for the relative lack of prestige/name recognition enjoyed by my current university when trying to calculate if I should even bother applying for a program at a given school?

 Should I apply directly to PhD programs, or do a standalone MA/MS first (hopefully creating a great grad school GPA and gaining some research experience in the process)?

 How do I commit to a single field and subfield for graduate study? I understand that the whole nature of doctoral level inquiry is specific, deep knowledge about a single subject, but the research questions that fascinate me are all interdisciplinary in nature. For example, my primary area of interest is academic/health/social outcomes in gender and sexual minority adolescents, especially those of Latino/a heritage. I could investigate the issues I care about via political science, sociology, geography, or even language. This is why I sought out an undergrad program that was explicitly interdisciplinary. Im finding it difficult to change that approach.

 On the above note, I realized last night that it would only take me 2 extra semesters of undergrad to end up with a major in modern foreign languages instead of my current minor in Spanish. If I did this, I would open up other options in terms of fields of study at the graduate level. In particular, I have a recurring fantasy about a degree in multiple Romance languages, such as is offered by U of Oregon and Johns Hopkins. How insane is this idea? Would I be better or worse off trying to find tenure-track positions in foreign language or social science?

I feel like I should clarify that I dont actually give a single fuck about the prestige of a particular school as long as the actual quality of the education there is high and I get to study what I am really interested in. Buuut Ive lived and worked in the U.S. job market long enough to know how much brand recognition matters to prospective employers. My understanding is that this is even more pervasively the case in academia, so Im trying to accept that I need to play the game to some extent.

If youve made it this far, thank you so much. If you have any words of advice for me, whether it be general, answers to questions I raised, or suggestions about specific programs, I would be genuinely grateful for your input. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This will be long. I apologize in advance.


Last fall, at the age of 38, I graduated with my associate's degree from my local CC. In researching schools to transfer to, I became aware of a new program at a small state university at the other end of my home state.


It was an interdisciplinary major in social science, which was exactly what I was looking for. Unlike a lot of social science programs, this one allowed you to choose 2 tracks to concentrate in among the 6 social science disciplines offered. When I got in contact with the coordinator, we also discussed the new secondary education major that the school had launched. Turned out that with the planned curriculum changes, I was going be able to double major in social science and secondary education, and graduate within 3 years with certification to teach social studies and Spanish to grades 7-12.


In the past, those in the social science major who also wanted teaching certification were required to choose history as one of their 2 tracks, but lucky me, with the changes being implemented, that would no longer be the case - I was free to choose the disciplines that most interest me (in my case, political science and sociology or geography - a toss up).


YAY!!! I was going to get to study the things I am actually interested in, and then, when I was done with the degree, I would have an actual professional skill that would be very likely to quickly translate to a stable job with decent benefits - even if the pay is shitty for the work required. This was really important to me...I have lived basically hand-to-mouth my entire adult life, and I really wanted my college degree to insulate me from that a bit, especially since it has taken me so long to get here.


That was a year ago. I have since completed nearly all of the content courses required for the social science major, and have completed 2 of the education courses. A week ago, just prior to my advising appointment for next semester, I received an email from a professor in the education department I had never met informing me that I had been assigned to her as a new advisee.


Long story short...my advisor - the one who was making changes to the secondary education program - is terminally ill and has taken an indefinite leave of absence. In his absence, no further progress is being made on getting changes finalized to the new major, which means that the old rules still apply. Which means...that since history is NOT one of my 2 tracks, I am ineligible for teaching certification unless I essentially start half my concentration over again.


Fuck that noise. I have already dropped the teaching certification option from my program, and I wil now graduate in May 2017 with a B.A. in Social Science and double minors in Spanish and Cultural Anthropolgy. So, as best I can tell, I have a few realistic options:

* federal/state government
* non-profit
* graduate school with an eye toward staying in academia


I'm OK with not using my degree to teach high school...I just want to be able to use it in some way. Before returning to school, I worked for state government for 8 years; I'd be happy to parlay that experience + my degree into something relevant. For example, I'd love to work in equal employment opportunity or fair practices, but no one can seem to give me any information about how to get a foot in the door with those jobs. I feel like there should be some kind of perfect internship opportunity here in my last year of school, but everyone I've talked to stares at me like a deer in headlights.


I'd also love to teach at the college level...I don't have so much ego that it needs to be a school with a recognizable name, but I don't want to be an adjunct indefinitely...because that's right back to the uncertainty and instablility that I've fought so hard to get away from. So should I go to grad school? Stop at the master's level and teach community college? Push through and get a PhD and hope against hope that I can find tenure track somewhere?


Other ideas appeal to me also...my pet issue is improving quality of life for GSM teens, so, as an off-the-top-of-my-head example, does the It Gets Better Project need a program assistant? Does that job pay enough for me to make rent? Again, I'm OK with not making a lot of money...it just needs to be enough to pay my rather modest expenses and leave a bit left over.


Any insight? Suggestions? Ideas I haven't thought of? I really appreciate any thoughts you might have to offer.


TL;DR: Was a double major in social science and secondary education. Recent events mean I can't get the teaching certification. What can I do with this degree that will make use of it and reliably keep a roof over my head? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's kind of a tall order, I know.

I'm an adult college student and I work 30 hours/week, so I do a lot of back-and-forth. 

I live in a mountainous area that gets a LOT of snow and some ice, and ice is how I flipped my 1998 GMC Jimmy a few weeks back, so trustworthiness in bad weather is a real priority now. 

I have a 19-year old that does metalworking/blacksmithing stuff, so I end up hauling a lot of pretty big, heavy gear around. I'm not comfortable doing that in a Honda Civic.

I can go as high as $6k on a cash sale...I suppose if a dealer were willing to let me finance *only* $2-3k on top of that, I'd be willing to have a *small* car payment, but I'd rather not, really.

So, can I please have your expertise and opinions? What would you guys recommend?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Deadlines and double standards [x-post from /r/college] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-22 18:15:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I originally posted this last night on /r/college, and I have been surprised and a bit confused by the overall indifference and mild hostility toward what I'm saying. Maybe it's because, as a non-traditional student, I have different expectations about the student-teacher relationship and the nature of each person's responsibility in the classroom. I don't know. But this issue is really bugging me, and I thought I'd post it here for a response from a somewhat different audience:

Now that the semester is over for most of us, I wanted to have a conversation about something that has been bothering me with increasing intensity each semester: the double standard that seems to apply when it comes to due dates and timeliness for work assigned to students, versus teachers' adherence to similar (or any) standards in returning graded work.


This semester, my classes began the last day of August. I had a class in which the professor didn't return a single piece of graded work until October 25, just one day shy of 8 weeks later.


This doesn't seem to be an outlier by any means. I had a classes my last 2 semester of community college in which we didn't receive any grades posted until at least midterms. I would estimate that the standard turnaround time on getting papers back across all classes is an average of 4-5 weeks.


Even published timetables don't seem to help much. Professors who say they will return work within one week get it back in 4, those who say they will return it in 2 weeks mean (usually) more like 6...but sometimes never.


A couple of things really trouble me about this situation. First, the lack of feedback about my performance for what essentially amounts to half a semester is really a problem for me. For one thing, if I haven't gotten back any graded work, how do I know that I am mastering the material and producing/performing to the instructor's standard? For another, like it or not, I really need and thrive on that (hopefully positive) feedback from my professor regarding my work. Sure, it would be great if I had an infinite wellspring of intrinsic motivation to do all of the work that is required of me over the course of a semester, but after writing and turning in three 5-page papers, it's agonizingly difficult to try to find the drive to write another when I don't even know if the first one I turned in was up to snuff. It is both anxiety provoking and maddening, causing me to exist in a state of both fear and rage for way too much of my semester.


So, I have 3 questions:

* What are your experiences with this?

* What do you guys think is reasonable in terms of turnaround time for graded work (understanding that professors have LOTS of students and papers take LOTS of time to grade)? and
 
* What, if anything, can I do to keep myself from blowing a gasket when this inevitably happens again next semester?

Thanks for your thoughts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got email this afternoon (to my personal, not school, account) about my student loans, so I have been trying off and on to connect to the school's website to take a look at the financial aid disbursement schedule.

More often than not, I get timed out. Once, I was able to get to PAWS, but not to the home page itself. Ordinarily, I'd chalk it up to heavy demand causing the system to barf, but since I did some updates to my PC today, I'm not sure if that might (also) have something to do with it.

Any FSU redditors been able to get to the school website today? If not, what kind of trouble are you having? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am giddy with excitement and relief right now...I just wish it weren't tainted with negative self-talk about how small my A.A. in General Studies from a community college is in the larger scheme of things.

I just turned in my last final exam for the last class in my degree program. This is especially significant for me, not because I've done really well (which I have), but because my struggle has always been with *finishing* things. The bigger the project, the greater the odds I would get bored, overwhelmed, or stuck in perfectionism and just abandon ship.

So, I'm trying to remind myself that *finishing* and actually getting a degree are the important outcomes of this process for me.

Reddit, please help me believe that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, everyone!

I will be relocating to western Maryland in the near future in order to attend Frostburg State as a transfer student. I am an adult ("non-traditional") student with a teenager of my own.

Having looked at a number of rental properties in Frostburg, I am starting to think that living outside the town itself may be a much better option for me. Either direction - west or east - would be fine, but I imagine that Cumberland has more rental housing options then, say, Grantsville.

What should I know about moving into Cumberland? How would you describe the various geographic areas/neighborhoods? I may not know enough to even ask the right questions, but does anyone have any tips to pass along?

I should mention that I'm moving from a very densely populated area of the state with a less-than-optimal crime rate, so I'm not really skittish about neighborhoods that are somewhat "borderline" -- I'm used to that. I do not, however, want to have to regularly deal with gunshots on my block or stepping over passed-out humans on my way home. (No, these examples are not hypothetical.)

Thanks in advance, local folks! Your wisdom is much appreciated. </TEXT>
