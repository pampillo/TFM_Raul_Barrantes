<TEXT> Some final words about why I write what I do - for kids its based in fantasy and mythology. I love stories that are grounded in mythology and folklore in YA and MG fiction. I think they really resonate with younger readers.

Many mythology tales are ageless and deal with universal truths that tweens and teens are experiencing themselves in both painful and wonderful ways: conflict, love, loss and friendship. Kids can relate to these topics along myriad avenues growing up. Also, there are quite a few superheroes in mythology and folklore, and kids love superheroes (and adults too!).

And as we seek out more diverse books, I love that authors can turn to folklore and mythology to write with diversity in mind. Many different people from around the globe have traditional tales passed down that enrich their culture: Indian, Native American, Egyptian, African, South American, Asian, Caribbean, Scandinavian, etc. 

Whats wonderful about this increased trend in multi-cultured books is that now children have more stories they can connect with based on their own background. And THIS gives them a sense of belonging - something which I didn't feel for much of my life, and many kids don't as well. 

I also love to write about kids being their own heroes and how finding the power within themselves is more powerful than ANY magic can ever be! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I also met my natural mother was I was 18, and recently had to cut ties with her. She was a very toxic presence in my life. Like my ex-husband, she is also a con artist and moves around living off people with malicious intent. Was good to shed her! Sadly, I never got to meet my natural dad. I was told he died in a car accident but recently found out it was suicide. He parked in front of a church and plugged up the tailpipe. I mourned the man I never knew, sad that I didnt have the chance to know him.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> oooh, you toughie Kristina! Well, there is that old saying you know "I like having written." This is true! The thing I like least about writing is how LONG it takes. I love SPEED in all things - reading, writing, biking, etc. But writing a full length novel is NOT instant gratification. The quickest book I wrote actually was Joshua and the Arrow Realm. I did it in 4 months and it was the tightest first draft ever. I brought everything I learned to writing it in one punch. It was also under contract so i HAD to write fast!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> And funny no one asked about my being adopted beside a cornfield! My parents were supposed to adopt twin boys but when they arrived the father had put a stop to the adoption so my mom said "Well, what else you got?" And it was me. But for some reason they had to drive across the county line and wait beside a cornfield for the social worker to bring me to them. Black market baby? Hmm...I wonder. Bet I could make up a story about that!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do! First, I would love to go back to England and do research there as a new book I am writing has a medieval flavor! 
Recently, as I mentioned, I was called to write a book in NH where I used to live (still in progress) and had to go back and see it. It was hard to visit that place again where I'd been a child - now with my mom having died. It's on Squam Lake in a tiny town of Holderness, where they filmed On Golden Pond. 
I was zapped back in time to the 1970s  and being nine-years-old. Suddenly, I was a child again, living each day in the moment. Swimming in the pool, fishing with my dad on Squam Lake, romping through the woods, collecting dead butterflies and shotgun shells, playing pinball machines, and spinning 45 records on the jukebox in the recreation hall. 
Returning was an emotional gut punch. I could be a child again in that place of innocence, a place where my mother was still alive. It also resurrected painful moments from childhood as well as joyous. I wrote a piece about that here: http://www.subject9748.com/throwbackthursday-story-childhood/

<TEXT> It is hard! I do it because if I don't - I have nothing else. No reason to be. Yes, I love being a mom and a wife and a friend but writing is MY SOUL. 
I try and set aside what isn't working and think up a new story - that usually gets my passion going again for what I love.
But ... occasionally there are those lows in my writing where I think OMG, this sucks. Or some times I get editorial feedback where I have SOOOOO much to fix in a manuscript and the challenge weighs me down. 
Those days are where I ask myself this question: Why am I a writer? And I can think: I should just update my resume and get a real full time job with a regular paycheck!
 Well, every time I think them  I remember how I sat down in my grief over losing my mom and wrote my debut novel without knowing anything about writing a book. 
And I remember how it came from my heart and came from the deep places inside me where I most love, where I most hurt. 
And I know that no matter how much I think I suck at times  I KNOW THAT I AM A TRUE STORYTELLER. And this is what I was born to do. 
So that is how I get by.
Oh, and a supportive husband...and some good beer :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Love this question Kristina! I started out writing for adults as I'm drawn to writing dark themes and then it was funny - I had a young voice in one book (the main character who then grew up) and my editor said I had a natural young voice. So I decided to explore it! I took a class in writing a children's book in 7 months and had the first in the Lightning Road series! The story grew from a tale I told my son as a young child and as he got older he was my perfect audience. I fell in love with writing for kids, especially fantasy! Your imagination can go anywhere and the world is full of magic. I am actually writing picture books now too :) . Funny enough, they contain some of the same themes in all my books that are personal to me: adoption, being an only child, and being abandoned by your family.  </TEXT>

I've also crashed my bike twice and once split the helmet wide open. I just love to fly! It makes me feel supernatural. (and don't tell my dad but my first car was a Mazda GLC and the speedometer said it went up to 125 so I had to make sure. And it did.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for joining in! Ha ha - actually that math fact is the one thing that isn't true! I actually was an ENGLISH teacher for a day. Spent all summer preparing then had a huge anxiety attack and quit. I went the alternative route in NJ where at the time if you had a degree they could accept you to teach in a full time role - without any experience. WTF was I thinking??

I do love my antihero characters! I do adore Batman I admit. Let me slink off to his cave with him. ha ha. But I wouldnt write about him. I am not into writing fan fiction but rather would love to make up my own characters and setting. My favorite tormented hero is King Arthur (and actually have a new middle grade idea for a book involving him right now that is wacky!)

I like to think I keep the material fresh as I write in a blend of genres - mixing fantasy, horror, supernatural, romance, and sci-fi.  I also love to create characters we may perceive as being one way...but then find out they are something entirely different than that initial trope.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've always wanted to be a writer since I was 7 and wrote my first piece - a murder mystery screenplay that I had the neighborhood kids act out. There's been murder, mystery and mayhem in most of my works ever since! LOL. I always knew I wanted to write novels though and started my first one 19 years ago. I wrote the first 2 chapters and shelved it for 10 years. Then my mom died. I was devastated and started writing that novel again to focus on anything but my grief. It became my first published novel. I think of it as her little gift to me that she left behind. I don't think I would be a novelist otherwise, so while I'm sad I can't share it with her - I feel like she has passed on her legacy through me. It's a bittersweet feeling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great question!! I went from writing thrillers for grownups to writing thrillers for kids and am drawn to the dark side but you can't cross some lines with kid lit! 

As my son became an avid and selective reader, I discovered that kids love to be scared not just in movies but in books too. I started reading some of the books my son had on his bookshelf and in doing this I began to see patterns in these kid adventure tales  and I began applying what I learned to create my own stories. In writing thrillers for kids I discovered these things:

Put the kids in charge. Kids dont want to read about grownups having adventures.
Which leads intohave the kids figure out how to take the bad guys downnot grownups. Kids want to see themselves as the hero!
Whatever scary situations they find themselves inthey must navigate their way out.
Dont dwell on the dark stuff. Make it happen fast without gory detailkids can use their imagination.
Give them friends in their travels.A kid needs friends to help him along his scary adventure.
Through story events,have the kids discover their own strength and courage to overcome bad things happening to them.
End the chapters on cliffhangers to encourage kids to want to keep turning the pages and find out what happens next.
Have it work out in the end, or at least partially, even if all seems doomed for a while.
Add humor! Interjecting a dollop of funny can alleviate the tension in the scariest of scenes.
Make it a series! Have a final resolution to the story but leave it open for more stories down the road. Kids love to follow their beloved characters into new adventures.

So while there are some tense, frightening things that happen in my kids' books I figured out this map to help guide me in writing them. :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, the first one I ever fell in love with was The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C. S. Lewis! It was fantasy and that was it for me. The first story I wrote after reading it was fantasy about a wizard, a flying ship and dodo birds. After that I fell in love with the Little House series by Laura Ingalls Wilder. I so wanted to be her! When we lived in a campground in NH and had hogs and chickens that I got to take care of, I so was Laura! I also got all of Roald Dahl's books from the Tooth Fairy :) . </TEXT>

<TEXT> HI, Im Donna Galanti and author of the first two books in the paranormal suspense series, A Human Element and A Hidden Element, and the first two books in my middle grade adventure fantasy series, Joshua and the Lightning Road and Joshua and the Arrow Realm.

Im drawn to exploring the twin sides of dark and light in my writing, whether for kids or grownups, and the tormented hero is my favorite. Much of my own life blends into my fiction, especially from my travels, having been adopted, and being an only-child. I started writing books out of grief after my mother died.

My newest book for kids, Joshua and the Arrow Realm, is a high-stakes romp through a wild, imaginary world where descendants of the Greek gods walk beside you, beasts abound, and not everythingor everyoneis as it seems. I think its a fun mix of mystery, mayhem, and fellowship. 

I love to write about kids being their own heroes and I also love traveling to schools where I (hopefully!) inspire kids to read and write. Middle grade is super fun  one step in the world of magic and one step in the real world. Ask me anything!

<TEXT> Yes, it does - but I also understand why it happens! I am an author and a publisher once told me that on average there can be up to 20 typos per book. And if a book goes to print and some are found later within this "20 rule" that it's acceptable. It cost far too much to pull the book back, re-edit, and upload online and layout again for printing. Really, think about it. An average novel for adults can be 100K words. It's very small in the scheme of things. Even with the author reading it several times and more than one editor. Things still get overlooked. And as a matter of fact, I am reading The Book Thief now and only 80 pages in and already have caught 2 typos! Very minor...but still! It happens more than you think. Human error :). We do not live in a perfect world but we do live in a wonderful world with storytelling - so this makes it worthwhile.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am in the middle of finishing a YA fantasy which is a beast at 125K words right now. Yikes! Using my 4-person critique group to help me tighten it up when I start revising. I love this new world so much but fear the world is competing with the story so need to balance that. But can't revise yet as I just finished my paranormal suspense novel this past week (that I started in NaNoWriMo) which is the 3rd in my Element Trilogy. Needed a push-start as my publisher wants it by May 30th. So 2.5 months to revise 110K words. Another beast! Fingers crossed! After that back to the YA fantasy. Lately, I've been doing a lot of 4am rising to get the words in. Does add up! I'm just not a night owl. Good luck everyone with your word counts!

<TEXT> Good luck to you! Starting out smaller is a good way to jump in. Also, you may want to consider starting out with having some published for free (as many online mags don't pay) just to build your portfolio. A friend of mine did this with flash fiction. :) I know getting paid is wonderful, but with short mediums like this sometimes just getting pubbed in reputable small mags can boost you up for getting into bigger, paid ones down the line.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're welcome! If you join a genre based org like HWA try to volunteer. Best way to meet writers of all sorts from debut authors to veteran authors. They can really help support you. I've volunteered now for 5 years for Intl Thriller Writers (social media and as a contributing editor for their Big Thrill mag) and made amazing connections that landed me blurbs, advisors, and publicity. Also, meeting agents in person boosts you up and there is a better chance of getting a request for a full MS. Writing cons are great for this -or use a reference as a recommendation too. If you find your query is getting no response than pull it back and revise it before sending out more. I was an intern for a Lit Agency as a first reader and saw what queries got the agent's attention.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off, congrats! I would recommend joining the Horror Writer's Association to network and find agents (and to build a support community). But also you can search for authors similar to you and in your genre + agent to see who agents them. Or just search horror - agents. Here is a post on Writer's Digest about them: http://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/guide-to-literary-agents/9-literary-agents-seeking-horror-now.
Also, check out the manuscript wish list for horror:
http://mswishlist.com/profiles/agent/horror
Check the hashtag on twitter too #MSWL for agents seeking horror
If you want to go direct to a publisher, you could do that route too and search for publishers who take submissions direct for horror.
I spent 2 years querying in batches and built a spreadsheet of agents - took 189 to get mine (not horror).
there are new agents all the time so I would also search for "new literary agents" + "horror". New agents are great to query as they are building their client list but have the backing of an agency behind them. 
Good luck!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my opinion, if you're a writer you MUST read. It's part of your job to know how story structure works (and doesn't work) and learn new techniques through reading. When I first started writing novels I lost my love for reading and couldn't concentrate to finish any - it was very depressing. THEN I realized that since I started writing my reading tastes had changed so I started reading things far outside what I ever had before. I fell in love again and realized I wasn't being challenged before and needed new reading challenges to stimulate my passion for reading and writing.  </TEXT>
