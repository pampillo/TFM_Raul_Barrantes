<TEXT> Before we start going down the *sous-vide* rabbit hole, I do not have access to anything of that sort.  I do have: one porterhouse steak, and a skillet that I plan on getting very hot. I don't cook steak often, I usually let some place that knows what they're doing cook my beef, but I'm curious as to what y'all recommend! 
Any tips regarding anything from basic cooking method to resting times will be appreciated.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, my friend. On spring break I once accidentally smoked ONE bowl of weed with some friends that had accidentally gotten mixed with weed. 
We assumed it was sand, since we were on the beach for break, little did we know that it a bag of coke in our safe managed to spill onto a loose nug or two.
Desperate as we were to smoke what little weed was left, we hit the "sandy weed" and the smoke was different. Immediately started feeling euphoric and not coked out, more spacey and an experienced something completely unique.

<TEXT> I have a Redbone Coonhound that I rescued, and his personality / needs sounds like they align with yours perfectly. Hounds are easy going, and loyal as can be. They don't require absurd amounts of exercise, but enjoy the outdoors and are happy to accompany you on a jog or trail hike. I would suggest considering that since you sound like you want a low maintenance dog that is easy to train, a GSD might not be as good of a fit as a hound.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Best over/under shotgun for under $1500? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-17 02:52:54 </DATE>

<TEXT> Afternoon folks, 

I'm wanting a new bird gun and I was wondering what you all use, and prefer, in the over/under shotgun field. 
I have always used semi autos for dove, but I want a gun that has a little more aesthetic appeal than my workhorse hunting rifle. 

What shotgun should I be considering to invest under $1500 into if I'm looking for a well made, pretty but reliable gun?

<TEXT> Very easy, my friend. My recipe serves 2-4 people.

- 2 Sticks of the best butter you can buy (I use Plugra)
- 2 Cups heavy cream 
- 2 Cups parmesan/asiago cheese 
- 2-4 Garlic cloves, depending on how much you like garlic
- 2 Lemons juiced fresh
- Pepper, ample amounts to taste 
- Salt to taste
- 3/4 Shrimp, peeled and devaned 
- Pasta of your choosing

0) Begin boiling your pasta. 

1) In a saucepan melt your butter, then combine your garlic to brown just a bit in the butter. 

2) Add your heavy cream to the butter and reduce for 5 minutes or so on low heat. The sauce should reduce but still be runny enough to wiggle in the pan with little effort.

3) Add your cheese, pepper, and salt to the milk/better mixture. Whisk until smooth. Reserve a little cheese for 
plating.

4) Drain pasta and in another pan quickly sautee the shrimp in some butter with lemon and garlic. 

5) Combine drained pasta with the alfredo sauce over low heat. 

6) Plate pasta and add shrimp.

Enjoy! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The ending reads exactly like a novel. "Sometimes I wonder if it was all a dream and my teacher was a ghost" is a lazy way to end a text, but it's done all the time in some fashion. 
This is all just a little too familiar as well. Loner kid, troubled home life, and his daddy's gun. Sounds like someone just watched a degrassi episode. 

But when I knew it was fake was when the author mysteriously found the gun which was supposed to never be seen again waiting for him at home.
Teachers at school would never let a child get away with brining a gun to school, therefore I call BS.

<TEXT> Muenster can be your friend, OP. 
Very mild and creamy. 
I'd also recommend some Oaxaca cheese, they use it in quesadillas in traditional Tex-Mex fare (which is my favorite). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, but I'm from south Texas and you'd be surprised on the variations you hear. Some swear on marinating in lime juice overnight, while others hit it with lime after grilling and let it sit. I get it, you're from Washington and you know what asada translates to in English. Congrats! I asked for the recipe because it looked homemade.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The .243 is great all around gun, and especially forgiving of beginners. There is low recoil, but just as much "oomph" and knock-down power to handle almost all North-American game including deer, pigs, varmints, and anything in between. Unless you are in the Canadian/Alaskan bush chasing predators such as bears, or hunting elk, the .243 is a great gun. I recommend a single shot by a reputable brand like CVA with bull barrel that has been shortened for youth.  </TEXT>
