<TEXT> I'm a mtf recently ive been having a lot of break downs looking in my self mirror is now just a painful task, in not fully out to the public but ie been trying to dress how I feel as much as I can but it doesn't seem to work anymore but a trans friend of mine said that even if I don't want to fully switch genders I can take estrogen and that would help my mood and help me feel more like I feel on the inside, so if anybody knows anything could you please help ? Or tell me even if it possible. </TEXT>
