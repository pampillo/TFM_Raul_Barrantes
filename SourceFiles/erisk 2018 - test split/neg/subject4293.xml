<TEXT> I never tried talking to it, but from what I hear, that's how they get to you. Sort of like vampires, who won't enter your home unless you verbally invite them. Kinda creepy thinking about what would have happened if I tried talking to it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Brother and I Encountered a Strange Creature Near Our Grandparents Cabin (Part 2) </TITLE>

<TEXT> [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/69rwyt/my_brother_and_i_encountered_a_strange_creature/)

Alright, so some people asked me to share more regarding the events that happened while I was visiting my grandparents cabin. I have not been there since, but my grandmother and her new husband stays there every summer. Note that it was about six years ago since the "moose incident".

For those who have not read the first part, the cabin is located in a very foresty area in south Sweden, on a pretty large island which contains only 2 cabins, separated by a pretty dense forest.

Through the magic of Facebook I contacted my grandma. We don't know each other all too well anymore, so I didn't really feel comfortable calling her. I told her about the moose-like creature and how my brother and I both saw it. She proceeded by typing for near 15 minutes, and I waited patiently. Her reply was a full story of her own encounter with what she said she had hoped was just a dysfunctional moose. Her writing was in swedish, so I will do my best to translate it.

'About twenty years ago, I was staying at the cabin by myself. Your grandpa was working at the time, so I was alone for the whole week. One night while I was sleeping, I woke up with an uneasy feeling. I wasn't sure why, but I just knew something was wrong. I felt as if I was being watched. My first thought was to fall back asleep, and so I did.

I woke up in what I believe was about an hour, and this time I was sure something wasn't as it should be. I felt the same feeling of being watched, and I could clearly hear something moving outside. I grab a bedside candle and light it, as I get out of bed. I choose not to pull the curtains, as I have this terrifying feeling that someone will be staring right at me. By now I am convinced that someone is trying to rob me. I was sleeping in a room at the back of the cabin, and so I walk up to the front and look out by the porch but see nothing. There are no neighbors nearby, and i can't call the police as i have no phone. I decide to go back to bed and try to sleep the fear away, and so I do.

I lay there for at least an hour without falling asleep, and although the sound is gone, the unpleasant feeling has stuck around. At the backside of the cabin, right outside of my window was an older cabin which we used before this one was built. The place was creepy, and we eventually decided to burn it down some years later. Anyways, I hear something bumping around outside of it, and i realize that i am going to have to look out the window. I get out of bed, light the candle again and go to pull the curtains. The uneasy feeling is still there, and I have the strongest feeling that something is going to stare right back at me. I pull the curtains, and for a second i am caught in complete horror. I see something staring back at me, but it is no robber. It is not a person. It is a moose. I expected to be relieved to find that it was nothing but a harmless animal, but that is far from what I was. After some seconds I calmed down, and the panic faded a bit. The thing was still staring at me, but it was for sure not a normal moose. I took some seconds to investigate it. For a first, it was not standing on four legs. It was bent forward as if the upper/front legs were just barely floating above the ground. It was also much more slim than moose usually are, and had this sort of disturbing twist in the body. The antlers just looked flat out terrifying. Naturally it doesn't say anything, but I had this very strong feeling that it wanted me to come out. It wanted me to let it help me. Although i felt that's what it wanted me to hear, i just knew the thing had bad intentions.

I faint within a few seconds, and wake up at morning and let out a scream of panic. The creature is gone, and I am contemplating wether or not I was dreaming. To this day, i was unsure if this had actually happened or if i was just dreaming. Now that I know you saw the same thing, I know it was real.'

My grandma suggested that I should tell my brother that I spoke to her about it, and I am seriously considering doing so. I mean, this for sure confirms that what we saw was not a normal moose. I had some thoughts thinking that it might just have been a handicapped or dysfunctional moose, but by the way my grandma said it tried to communicate with her, and convince her, U knew it was the same thing that my brother and I encountered, as it too tried to talk to us.

Apparently, she had already told this story to my mom and grandpa, but they just brushed it off and said it was either an injured moose or she was dreaming.

Hearing about this story just made me all the more scared, but at the same time curious about what exactly the creature was, and what it's purpose was. Was he trying to lure us into the forest? Was he actually trying to help us with something? Did he want help? Hopefully i will get some more clarification the more that I talk to people about it.

I ended up sending some pictures of wendigo and skinwalkers to her, and she definitely saw resemblances between them and the moose-like thing. Definitely sent shivers down my spine.

To all of the people reading this, if you ever encounter a weird looking creature with antlers, DO NOT speak with it, or even acknowledge their presence. That's what they want. </TEXT>
