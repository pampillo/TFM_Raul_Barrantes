<TEXT> I first read it the way it was recommended on the prologue, but skipping some of the optional chapters and wandering around to read some random ones.
When re-reading, I just read random chapters, one will remind me of another, and I go find that one.
I still find connected chapters that I hadn't realized. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If the materials are worth more than the coin, what would prevent someone from getting a lot of those coins, melt them, and sell them for the material?

The cost of *making* it and the cost of the material are very different. You can offset the cost of making it because of the utility of using it multiple times. You can't prevent people from melting them if the metal is worth more. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I love the way in which Hopscotch seems like a lived memory rather than a read one. </TITLE>

<TEXT> In the book, you can read the chapters in any order you like.
I recently discussed this with a friend. Hopscotch (by Cortazar) is stored in my memory almost as a lived memory. I think it's because you have to read the story out of order and put together the chronology in your head. Similar to how in real life we remember things related to each other thematically, and then have to think harder to see what happened first. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Still unconvinced. Have you seen that weird shape in the middle? Why would the stream of water run down the tree like that?

I think it's more likely due to [smoldering](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smouldering) like a friend of mine suggested. That combustion is slower than flame combustion, and lower temperature.
I guess it was smoldering without rain, and then rain started and stopped the whole process. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A friend suggested it may have started [smoldering](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smouldering) , which moves slower and at lower heat than flame combustion.
Then, maybe the bark is less sensitive to smoldering so the burnt advances more in depth than in surface. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lightning could explain how the fire started (although it would be weird that it would start so low, since lightning hits trees on the top and the top was healthy). But more importantly, lightning doesn't explain the weird shape of the burnt region or the precise boundary between burnt and unburnt regions. </TEXT>
