<TEXT> Buses in their current incarnation are very very unappealing and bad solutions to the function they're meant to serve: "last mile" transportation. 

In an ideal scenario where a city's subway and commuter rail is relatively comprehensive, buses should be designed to take passengers from the subway/train station nearest to their destination, to a bus stop that's even closer to their destination, minimizing walking required. 

The problem is that buses are currently behemoths that are way too big for the roads/lanes they drive on, are super loud and spew fumes as others have said, and bus stops don't adequately provide seating and protection from weather.

Make them electric, shrink them down to sizes that can make turns without taking up 2.5 lanes (while increasing number of buses to make up for smaller size), and improve the bus stops themselves, and people will happily use them.

I live in NYC, by far the most transit oriented city in America, and even here, people who use subway and commuter rail daily cannot stand buses. Buses aren't "uncool", they just suck. Thankfully Lyft and Uber are working on shuttle services with fixed routes, and we can see how such an improved system will increase ridership. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Should we put more thought into the optimal size for buses? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-30 18:05:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Living in NYC, I've noticed that the streets as they are, are not optimally designed to accommodate the size and turning radius of buses at all. They accelerate slowly, which slows down traffic behind them, and take very wide turns that causes them to take up a lane and a half in the process.

Since widening all of a city's lanes to accommodate buses would be a huge undertaking, wouldn't it make sense to rethink the optimal design of a city bus? I'm starting to like the design Elon Musk [put forward](https://www.dezeen.com/2016/07/28/elon-musk-vision-autonomous-buses-updated-tesla-master-plan-part-deux/) a few months ago:

 "With the advent of autonomy, it will probably make sense to shrink the size of buses and transition the role of bus driver to that of fleet manager," said Musk. "It would also take people all the way to their destination."
 
 Buses will be completely redesigned to make them use space more efficiently, with central aisles and entrance ways removed. These smaller buses would also help reduce congestion.

In other words, it would make more sense to create buses that have a similar box design that maximizes space utilized by passengers, but on a smaller scale that holds say 10-15 people, rather than the 40+ that a typical city bus holds. Because there's no central aisle, these "buses" would instead open up gullwing style and allow each passenger to sit directly into their seat. 

This would make entry/exit much faster and less cramped, and having a larger number of these smaller buses would mean more frequent service. This kind of bus wouldn't take massive turns and accelerate just as fast as a regular car, especially if its electric, allowing it to move with the flow of traffic much better.

<TEXT> I can't think of another suburban region with a transit system as extensive as the LIRR. For many people such as myself, I can take a 15 minute walk to my nearest station, take it to Jamaica, hop on the AirTrain, and board my flight at JFK without ever stepping foot in a car or dealing with traffic. Same goes for heading into the city. 

If the station's not walking distance, the vast majority of LI-ers can drive to their station in 5-10min and park. As much as I love to hate on LIRRs many annoyances, it's def a game changer to have that option. It would be very missed if I were to ever move somewhere else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look up Public Private Partnerships. It's actually a pretty clever way to get infrastructure built quickly and on budget when done right. The gist of how it works is that the "Private Investor", who is essentially a development company, foots the bill for the project themselves. They make their money back plus some profit by taking a certain % of tax revenue from that infrastructure until they've made the money. 

The benefits are that unlike gov, they don't need to go through the length process of getting the budget/tax hike approval to fund it, the cost is spread out. Also, because they don't start making the money back until that piece of infrastructure is actually being used, they have an incentive to finish it quickly. PPP is becoming more and more widely used because of those advantages. I pray Trump's administration doesn't find a way to screw it up, because it can result in a massive amount of modernized infrastructure, and fast. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see this mentality time and time again. Cities are naturally a dynamic, constantly changing beast. You don't get to dictate what kind of "charm" you want to remain in the city. You don't get to dictate what kind of "feel" the neighborhood has. 

The only thing you have power over is your own property, and that's it. If a town/city changes and you don't like those changes, you have every right to move somewhere that better fits your preferences. 

This NIMBY mentality of trying to force the current locals' preferences and therefore jacking up prices and blocking transit that would improve traffic, is just colossally arrogant and selfish. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's what I feel would be the simplest solution. Wittle all these apps down to three:

1. **GChat**: An iMessage equivalent that defaults to RCS and all its iMessage-like features, and when the recipient doesn't have RCS capability, falls back to SMS. The majority of those I know already call Hangouts "Gchat", and it sounds natural to say "Gchat me". This would be the default texting app on all Android phones, Google could theoretically strong-arm OEMs by withholding Google Services if they don't play ball. Also, they would bundle the Gchat extension into chrome by default so even the average user would be able to answer texts from their laptop without having to know to install something.

2. **Duo**: Include a vchat button in Gchat which opens this already existing app. Keeps things simple when you just want to video chat without opening an entire texting app. Similar to iMessage vs. FaceTime.

3. **Google Teams**: Rename Hangouts to this, and make it the Slack/Skype competitor that handles enterprise chats and video conferencing. Sounds more professional than "Hangouts" but with all the robust videoconferencing reliability.

Bam, done. </TEXT>
