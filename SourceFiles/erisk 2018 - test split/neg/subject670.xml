<TEXT> He got a lot of ideas from Revan about how the Dark Side worked, but Bane was the one that came up with the specific Rule of Two.

It would be like saying Maxwell discovered Einstein's theory of relativity. Could Einstein have come up with his theory without the work done by James Maxwell? Probably not, but it was still Einstein that made the leap to his theory of relativity. </TEXT>

Sidious only encoded the "Rule of One" after killing all of the Jedi. This is -again- in line with Bane's teachings, since the purpose of the Rule of Two was to find a Sith Lord capable of wiping out the Jedi. After Sidious wiped out the Jedi, there no longer was a need for a "Rule of Two."

Still, we can see his Baninite beliefs ran pretty strong even after that, since he still courted Luke as his Apprentice, and then pitted him against his current Apprentice. </TEXT>

He had multiple Apprentices for *short times* only. He would quickly pit them against each other to see who was the strongest.

In accordance with Bane's teachings, he wanted his Apprentices to be  the **second** strongest Dark Side user in the galaxy. Whenever he met someone he thought might be more powerful then his current Apprentice, he would do some preliminary training and/or corrupting, and then make sure they crossed paths and fought his current Apprentice. If they won, they became his new Apprentice.

The fact Anakin kept killing his Apprentices was one of the reasons he made corrupting him a priority. Clearly, Anakin was demonstrating *he* should be Palpatine's Apprentice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The theory behind the practice was sound (given Bane's assumptions about how the Dark Side worked). But, there certainly were some issues with individuals that didn't fully agree with his principles. Bane himself had to kill a few Appearances because they weren't on board with all of his ideas, and -down the line- there were some Master/Appearances that didn't follow the code as Bane intended.


IMO, the theory was sound, but people (or Sith) are flawed. But, Bane was a purest, and his laws reflect that purism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It made sense if you think about it in the terms of individualistic Social Darwinism and understand Bane's Dark Side philosophy.

Darth Bane thought that the Dark Side (being very individualistic) was only as strong as the individuals practicing it. He was upset that sometimes weaker Sith would team up to kill a stronger Sith. He felt this weakened the Dark Side itself.

The [Rule of Two](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Rule_of_Two) was made to stop this practice.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Darth Bane started his own Sith Philosophy, underpinned by something called "[The Rule of Two.](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Rule_of_Two/Legends)"

Basically, he thought that the Dark Side (being very individualistic and akin to Social Darwinism) was only as strong as the individuals practicing it. He was upset that sometimes weaker Sith would team up to kill a stronger Sith. He felt this weakened the Dark Side itself.

So, he took it upon himself to kill all the other Sith, and then declared there could only be two: One to have the power (The Master), and one to desire the power (The Apprentice). It was the job of the Apprentice to kill the Master if/when they become more powerful than the Master. Thus, the Dark Side would become ever stronger, as stronger and stronger Sith took on the mantle of Master.

Emperor Palpatine could trace his training back, Master to Apprentice, to Darth Bane. He was a true "Baninite," and took the Rule of Two pretty seriously. </TEXT>

If you fold your arms and say "Well, I don't want to play until the rules are fair," then you'll be marginalized. Why should politicians care about someone who doesn't vote? If you want to make changes, then you have to participate. Why do you think Bernie become a democrat and didn't stay as an independent? Look at what's happening now that he did. If he has ran as an independent (as his ideology would dictate), he would have been marginalized. But, because of what he did we are now seeing sweeping change in the Dems.

If you want to make practical changes, you have to be pragmatic. </TEXT>

I was sitting at the table. We had finished dinner. Were now having dessert. And we had the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that youve ever seen, and President Xi was enjoying it, Trump recalled in an interview with Fox News Business host Maria Bartiromo that aired on Wednesday.

And I was given the message from the generals that the ships are locked and loaded, what do you do? Trump went on. And we made a determination to do it, so the missiles were on the way. And I said, Mr. President, let me explain something to you.
So what happens is, I said, Weve just launched 59 missiles heading to **Iraq** and I wanted you to know this. And he was eating his cake. And he was silent, Trump added.

Yes. Heading toward Syria, Trump affirmed. And I want you to know that, because I didnt want him to go home. We were almost finished. It was a full day in Palm Beach. Were almost finished, and I  what does he do, finish his dessert and go home and then they say, You know, the guy you just had dinner with just attacked a country?

How did he react? Bartiromo asked.

So he paused for 10 seconds and then he asked the interpreter to please say it again. I didnt think that was a good sign, Trump said. And he said to me, Anybody that uses gases ... but anybody that was so brutal and uses gases to do that young children and babies, its OK.

He was OK with it. He was OK, Trump added. </TEXT>

Like, boldfaced lies don't matter? We have to try to get them on something like this because it makes a great *soundbite?* I'm mad at everyone that's supposed to care about truth. The media, the American people, the president. *Everyone.*

No one seems to care if something rings *true* or *false* anymore, just how the ringing **sounds** when you make it a soundbite. </TEXT>

Regardless:

If you go back to your home countries and your proponent of the defense of the Judeo-Christian West and its tenets, oftentimes, particularly when you deal with the elites, youre looked at as someone who is quite odd. So it has kind of sapped the strength. But I strongly believe that whatever the causes of the current drive to the caliphate was  and we can debate them, and people can try to deconstruct them  we have to face a very unpleasant fact. And that unpleasant fact is that there is a major war brewing, a war thats already global. -Bannon

I mean, we can disagree on terminology of what constitutes a big "C" Crusade. But, he is saying he is expecting a "major war" in "defense of the Judeo-Christian West and its tenets." </TEXT>

"It is a myth that only good jobs go to college graduates and that workers with high school degrees are destined to low-wage careers, said Rosemary Haefner, vice president of human resources for CareerBuilder, in a statement. Its important to note, however, that most high-paying **jobs available to high school grads involve skill sets that require extensive post-secondary training or several-years worth of prior experience,** and are often in fields that have seen **declining employment** in recent years.

<TEXT> You are just deeply confused.

Which is why I am asking questions. I asked you to tell me how many programs America would have to have to be Socialist. 
Someone that read "all" of the literate would know. Yet, your quote from Carl Marx doesn't address America, nor the number needed for a country.  You say I am confused. Alright, educate me. Let me ask the question a different way:

Would America have to include ALL programs to become "Socialist?" Or is there some critical number? By having *any* "socialized programs" have we already started down the path of Communism already? If 'yes,' should we back off the path and start privatizing things like the Army and courts? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, to a degree all countries have some level of socialism.  If you have your government do 'something,' that 'something' is socialized.

America has socialized courts. America has a socialized military. And, America has socialized police and firefighters, which makes it weird we don't want to socialize our hospitals too. Since those three things (policemen, firemen, and doctors) normally go together in culture.

That what is meant by "socializing medicine," it means you put the hospitals in with the police and the firemen.  This is what England has done. They have many socialist programs (and a [strong socialist party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats)), but they are still capitalists as well. You can be both, and most countries are both. Just the *degree* of which is varied.

That is the point of this video. The English -by and large- know that "socialism" isn't a bad word, just the EXCESS of socialism (AKA "Communism") is bad. Just like an excess of capitalism would be bad. Unless you feel that the courts and the police should be run by Google, you're not a pure capitalist either. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The issued visas and greencards were done under faulty conditions

Right, as I said, you think we should 100% trust Obama when it comes to suspicious countries, but 0% trust him when it comes to [good people that helped us](http://www.bizpacreview.com/2017/01/28/iraqi-translator-detained-airport-stuns-reporters-surprising-answer-president-trump-441477) in those suspicious countries. Those people need to be stopped, you know, for the *symbolism.*

 he needs to ban them temporarily to ascertain their legitimacy.

So, how many extremists have been caught using this method? Have we caught more 5-year-olds than terrorists?

Also, back in 2015, December, he called for a 3 month ban ["until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on"](http://www.vox.com/2015/12/7/9867900/donald-trump-muslims). Dec2015-Jan2017 is a *long* 3 months for this "temporary indefinite ban."

Let me put this in easier terms: Your boss just got fired for being a fuckbag, new boss comes in and sees what the fuckbag has done, new boss decides to rollback the damage.

Expect when it comes to which places the new boss should shit on. Then the old boss got everything 100% right. It's just the [people who RISKED THEIR LIFE aiding the company](http://www.vox.com/first-person/2017/1/30/14431650/trump-visa-ban-american-resident-stories) that the old boss liked. Fuck those guys, 'cuz symbolism.

Yeah, I'm fine with footing the bill initially, it's a tiny one

Oh, can I have a billion dollars then? I mean, if 12-20 billion is so small... Anyway, maybe the money should be used on... IDK, roads? Oh, right, Trump plans in outsourcing that too, [for more toll roads.](http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/313145-toll-roads-poised-to-boom-under-trump-plan) He'll get us US citizens to pay for the wall we don't need, and the roads we do need.

Mexico will be kicking up a tantrum before they succumb

[As will the US citizens who's land you will be seizing to build that wall.](http://www.theblaze.com/news/2012/10/15/landowners-along-u-s-mexico-border-claim-govt-is-abusing-its-power-to-take-land-at-unfair-prices/)

Empathy regarding what? 

Humans. I guess I will have to wait until he does something to effect you, personally, before you'll care.

Wasted tax dollars or families of illegals mooching off of our welfare when it could obviously go to American citizens?

Well, your ~12 billion dollar wall [will not address your 113 billion dollar illegal problem](https://www.wired.com/2017/01/wall-alone-cant-secure-border-no-matter-pays/) (but I guess you don't read citations, or make them). Anyway, so, the plan to fix wasted tax dollars is to wast more dollars? [I mean, illegals pay more in taxes than Trump.](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/oct/02/maria-teresa-kumar/how-much-do-undocumented-immigrants-pay-taxes/) So, we are back to my original statement:

If you want to get rid of wasteful moochers, we should deport HIM. </TEXT>

Anyway, [Trump is already planning on having American consumers pay for the wall.](http://fortune.com/2017/01/26/donald-trump-mexico-pay-tax-wall/) But, I am glad you are showing a complete lack of empathy and understanding when it comes to your "symbolism." Makes it easier for me. </TEXT>

Barry didn't think the [war heroes](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/iraq-war-hero-humiliated-travel-ban/) and [5-year-olds](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2017/01/30/sean-spicer-is-right-that-five-year-old-refugee-has-diabolical-plans/?utm_term=.ee2998a50f97) in them were a threat. But, I do think it's funny you're blaming Obama for something Trump did. Keep it up for the next 4 years.

Personally, I think that it's mostly about the symbolism, much like the wall.

Ah, nothing like a [12-billion dollar symbol.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU8dCYocuyI) I hope he outsources Trump Real Estate to build it. I hear those guys do good work.

<TEXT> You said Islam was trying to conquer Europe in the past? Well Europe HAS conquered the Middle East.

Anyway, the immigrants from the Irish Potato famine to the US were not well educated. And, they experienced a lot of push back in the US as did the Germans immigrates. So much so a whole new political party formed to stop them. One that was anti-Catholic, as you are being anti-Islamic. *The movement arose in response to an influx of migrants and promised to "purify" American politics by limiting or ending the influence of Irish Catholics and other immigrants, thus reflecting nativist and anti-Catholic sentiment. It was empowered by popular fears that the country was being overwhelmed by German and Irish Catholic immigrants, whom they saw as hostile to Republican values and as being controlled by the Pope.* [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_Nothing)

There have been similar groups in Europe (most notably in Germany) in response to an influx of Orthodox Jews. They never seem to lead to anything good.

But, back in the US, the Germans and the Irish immigrates did eventually accumulate (or their children did, anyway). And their dependents ended up being a big help in stopping that German movement a century later. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Based on our two economies, probably yes. In the short run, there are problems. In the long run, immigrants help a country.[[1]](https://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/economic-benefits-immigration-5712.html) [[2]](http://www.bushcenter.org/catalyst/north-american-century/benefits-of-immigration-outweigh-costs.html) Just look at the US after it got that influx of immigrants from Europe. There was trouble with assimilation (all the 'littles' in NY, gangs, poverty). But, those immigrants made us a super power in the end.

Of course, people now a days don't seem to be looking to the past to predict the future. They are obsessed with the present. So, people living-in-the-moment want the immigrates out, sure. They cause problems in the 'now.' </TEXT>

So, I'm not sure what is so unbelievable about the super-rich (oligarchs) being anti-middle class. They could easily be trying to create a noblemen-serf dynamic, not a upper-middle-lower class dynamic.  The noblemen-serf dynamic stagnates movement (both up and down). So, if you're on top, and want to stay on top, the noblemen-serf dynamic is more appealing then the upper-middle-lower class dynamic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But, it was half of my DNA. At one point,would you say half of 'me' was sperm. Does that mean that sperm is half a person? Flushing one sperm cell down the toilet would be half as bad a murder?

See, "your DNA" is a fine arbitrary definition of a person. But, its not the arbitrary definition I use to define a person. My consciousness, my mind, is much more important to me than my physical body. Brain death, to me, is tantamount to real death. And, if you found a way to download my consciousness into a different body (with different DNA) I would consider that new body to be "me."  I also don't think cutting out cancer cells, with their unique human DNA, is the same as murdering a person, since--again--I would arbitrarily define a person as a consciousness.

With that in mind, thalamic brain connections, which mediate sensory input, form in fetuses typically after 26 weeks.

<TEXT> Alright. My point has simply been that (if we are assuming "realism") fighting with a metal staff does not prepare one for fighting with a sword made out of light.

Now, in saying that, I think that the movie directors made it clear that Kylo, while proficient with lightsabers, was near death. Thus, he wasn't in fighting shape. And, while Rey (arguably) wasn't proficient with a lightsaber, she wasn't a combat novice nor was she impaired like Kylo.

Anyway, I agree with your assessment of how it would work in 5th edition. </TEXT>

Anyway, I'm not sure what your preference in editions has to do with whether or not Rey's training with the staff is directly applicable to using a lightsaber. </TEXT>

Whether or not waiting when there is no need to wait is "the right thing" would depend on circumstance, to be sure.

<TEXT> The reason lightsabers required different training then a sword was explained in the 3e book:

* Because only the handgrip has any weight, unskilled users have difficulty judging the position of the blade. They are as likely to injure themselves as harm their opponents. The lightsabers true potential becomes apparent in the hands of a fully trained Jedi, who can defend and attack with the weapon, deflecting blaster bolts or striking opponents with the glowing blade.

Which always seemed like a good reason to me as to why you needed a different skill set to use a lightsaber then you did a sword. </TEXT>

I find it frustrating when other Trump supports seem to think he is not a typical politician, when making outlandish promises you don't intend to fulfill is the quintessential caricature of a typical politician.

But, yeah, his judge appointments are likely to be more conservative than Hillary's would have been. True. If that's your main issue than I guess you picked the right guy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm the guy. You said:

 He dropped them because there was nothing there.

In reference to "the charges" I was asking about, and than went on to say in the same post:

The FBI does not press charges anyhow.

I was confused before, but I became downright befuddled. What was the "them" you were talking about being dropped? I guess it was the "recommendation to press charges?"

Look, I already early voted for Clinton yesterday, so I understand you might be wasting your time talking to me. But, I think the distinction between "recommended charges" and "charges" is kinda a thin hair to slice with a guy asking a question about the whole thing. </TEXT>

**Edit:** I'm being told I should have said "recommend charges" when I asked my question for clarification on this issue. I am sorry, I didn't realize this was such a touchy issue.  I mean, I already early voted for Clinton yesterday.

The Democratic party wanted a Democrat. The Democratic party didn't want a non-Democrat.   The non-Democrat didn't get the Democratic nomination; the Democrat did.

Hillary was better suited to win the Democratic primary; one of the main reasons being she was a Democrat. Again, I don't really see your point. What's wrong with 'the party' not wanting an outsider to win?  

My point is that Bernie (or whoever) would have been better suited to win the general, like Kasich (or whoever) would have been better suited to win the general. But, they lost their respective primaries because they were not better suited to win those. Had they been, they would have. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No one has what it takes "on their own." You can't just vote for yourself and call it a day.

But, why would the Democratic party rally behind someone who just joined their party less than a year ago to run for president? Bernie wasn't a Democrat. He was a proud independent his whole life, until 2015 when he switched to run for president.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders) Many of his supports weren't even registered to vote in the Democratic primary, since they were independents too.

It's not really that shocking someone who isn't a Democrat didn't win the Democratic primary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that if things where different, things would have been different. But, things aren't different. So, the tautology is a meaningless one.

Hillary and Trump had what it took to win their respective primaries, aka more people voted for them in them than anyone else. We are seeing here that the majority of people that vote in primaries don't have the same metric for candidates as the majority of people that vote in the elections.

Also, we have seen in the last 8 years that the majority of Republican primary votes are WILDLY different from the majority of votes. Trump is just the latest and most extreme example of this fact. </TEXT>

If the leaks had happened earlier, she might have lost. And, if she ran before 1913, she would have lost. "What ifs" aren't really useful here. More people voted for Hillary and Trump in the primaries than for the other candidates, thus they won.

Any claim otherwise is ontologically incorrect. </TEXT>

Whatever else you want to say about shady dealings, Hillary got more human beings to vote for her in the primary than Bernie did. That is what it takes to win an election, people voting for you.

If we've learned anything this election, it's that what it takes to win a party primary in this country is drastically different than what it should take to win an election. </TEXT>

Every single person I've debated this with since it broke spent more time shit talking X than defending Y. They know Y's indefensible, they just loathe X more.

You're not defending your candidate, you're just attacking the other one. I've experienced about the same, which is why I am looking forward for this toxically negative election to end. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I didn't suggest we "give it a try *just because."* I suggested giving it a try *because* there seems to be a demand for it. So, my logic would not lead to "giving everything a try."

Additionally, looking at some of the source code for the webpage, it seems it would be a trivial change to make. So, I reject the idea that it would be costly, as your "karma for money" idea would be.

Right now, it is a fact that multiple people have asked for this feature. And, there is only conjecture supporting the stance that it is a 'bad' (or 'good') idea. I would suggest finding out if the idea is good or bad empirically.

Regardless, I'm not sure I understand the purpose of this subreddit, if it's not to determine if there is a demand for new, inexpensive reddit features.  </TEXT>

Right now, to see the worst you have to click "show show show" and scroll down and down and down. It's a real hassle for those of us that do, on occasion, want to read the worst comments. It seems needless tedious to hide these undeleted comments when some people do want to read them.

It would also make it easier for people to check what had been said, but rejected. You -youself- might like that, as it would mitigate "bad" suggestions from being made over and over. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The reason Bernie didn't win was because people are apathetic about voting. More 'boring' people went out to vote for the "safe" candidate, because many radicals are disillusioned with the whole process so many didn't bother.

Politicians pay "a fuck ton of money" to perpetuate the myth that "votes don't matter." That way they only need to pander to old people that **do** vote. Young people's voices don't get heard simply because they're conditioned not to use them. Politicians don't have to answer to likes on facebook; they have to answer to people that go vote. And, they spend money to make people think it's the other way around.

<TEXT> Yeah, the problem with FPtP is any 3rd party candidate will draw votes *away* from the person who is *most* ideologically similar to them. Meaning the candidate *least* like them will now have a *better* chance of winning (and should give money to the 3rd party candidate LEAST like themselves). Which is why Bernie didn't run 3rd party, doing so would drastically increase *Trump's* chances of winning.

So, a [strategic voter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_voting) in a FPtP should always vote for whichever they **hate the least** in the top two, not whoever they like the most out of everyone. Thus, we *always* end up with "the lesser of two evils." </TEXT>

Anyway, [have you seen this video about why our democracy leads to two parties yet.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo)  At this point in a FPtP democracy, people are strategically voting AGAINST a person, not **for** a person.

The 'exact same' isn't "continuity?" Or are you saying we don't have a "real" democracy?  What would be an example of a "real" one, in that case?

 Do you really think we have the two best candidates being presented as a choice? 

If you vote for someone other than yourself, you've already compromised. Since no one else but yourself agrees with you 100% of the time. Clinton is the "best choice" for exactly one person, as is Trump.

Anyway, some day people will stop accepting this "least worst" arrangement and write in their best choice.

If we all write 'ourselves' no one will win. You need compromise in a representative democracy. 

I just want to promote the fact that as bad as trump has the potential to be, Clinton has the track record that shows what a shitshow her regime will be.

<TEXT>  Why do you think she would show restraint in Syria?

The "restraint" we are talking about is that she would evaluate the situation based on known intel and modulate her choice of action based on what others, like Russia, are doing and saying.

When it comes to that level of "restraint," as in, who looks at data outside of themselves (as you seem to be doing now), which candidate -Trump or Clinton- does it better? Well, before you answer, let me back up a bit and look at this interaction between me and your.

See, the issue I have with the discussion we are currently having is you are focused on one issue. You see what Clinton has done in the past, and are assuming she will make choices you don't agree with in the future. And, since you have little to no data on Trump, you are assuming his (null_return) will be better than something you know already you don't like.

And, I think that's fine. Seems reasonable based on the assumptions you are making.

However, I -speaking for myself- am worried about a broader spectrum than just Assad. I am more worried about the overall ideology of the candidates. I see one candidate that makes decisions based on what those around them are doing. Who changes tactics and responds to new information. And, I see one candidate that looks to himself and surrounds himself with sycophants. 

That -to me- is the important issue. Not which candidate will make the best decision on ONE issue, but which candidate has the best OVERALL IDEOLOGY when it comes to HOW one makes decisions.  Which candidate relies on new information.

So, if you want me to say that Trump is better than Clinton **when it comes to Assad,** I do not mind conceding **that** point. I will say I don't have enough information to claim otherwise.

I am more concerned with **WHY** Trump made his choice, what reasoning went into it?
And, WHY did Clinton make hers, what reasoning went into it?

You seem to know why Clinton made her statements about it. Do you know why Trump made his? </TEXT>

You don't think 'heedless and headstrong' is a better descriptor of Trump?

That's why it is so annoying that trump gets called out for bullshit while Clinton gets a free pass for actual insanity.

She hasn't done anything about Assad yet. She's only had 'bullshit words.' So, there is no 'actual insanity.' You've just painted a pretty picture based on speculation.

Yet, we can't even speculate about what Trump might do because he's never even worked for the government. While Clinton (and her husband) HAVE worked for the government, and hasn't caused Russia to Nuke us.  Or, am I wrong about that? Clinton has been at the highest level of power already, and we seem to still all be here. </TEXT>

So, it is your assertion that Clinton will attempt to remove Assad by force, even if Russia threatens us with nuclear retaliation if we do? They she will not be respectful of diplomacy *in anyway,* and would be heedless and headstrong in all of her attempts?

Well, I guess we will have to agree to disagree. </TEXT>

I have no idea what you are talking about. I said "you shouldn't vote for Trump" and suddenly you started talking to me about Assad and how Clinton would be both too nice and too mean to Jihadists.

I mean, I guess I kinda care about removing a murderous dictator. But, I wouldn't put "who may or may not attempt to stop an ongoing genocide in an unspecified way" on the top ten issues I care about. Yet, it seems as if you feel this whole Assad thing is the end all and be all of not voting for Trump. 

People seem unsure whether or not Trump will start the **nuclear holocaust.** That's more of a concern to me than whether or not Clinton will use ground troops to attempt to remove some dictator half a world away. </TEXT>

The point is to try and get people EXCITED for Hillary. Otherwise its just "vote for someone you don't like because she'd not Hitler, or don't vote."

Look, I've been a Democrat my whole life AND I think Trump is Loonytoons. But, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to muster the will to leave my computer and go vote come November. I've voted for a Democrat in every presidential election I've been eligible to vote in, but why should I bother this time if Hilary is inevitable? Just 'cuz the other guy is worse, but will not win anyway?  

If that's the only reason, I'll stay home.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  How did the rebellion morph into a jihadist movement teeming with mercenaries? How did Isis run convoys of hundreds and thousands of tankers across open terrain under the watchful eyes of our drones and bombers? Why did Isis fight the government coalition tooth and nail to keep supply lines open from turkey, a US ally and NATO member? Why do 80% of Syrians think Isis is a US creation? Why does Hillary want a no fly zone?

I have no idea. I thought you were the one informing me about stuff. YU asking all these questions?

If you look at Libya you can see what will happen if they remove Assad: jihadist takeover. 

I thought the US was good at installing puppet governments? It seems like that's happened more often than Jihads. Am I wrong about that? How many Middle Easter governments have been created over how many Jihadist groups, do you know?

But, who is talking about removing Assad again? How'd we even get on him? Do you have a citation?  </TEXT>

Freeze Mage has been with us since day one. If it really was that big of an issue, like I guess this one-mana Purify is, they had plenty of opportunity to change it. They could have done so when they were nerfing the base cards.

<TITLE> Trump's manner of speaking is fundamentally unable to explain nuanced ideas like 'Nuclear Policy.' </TITLE>

<TEXT> [I've been reading the transcripts on the issue.](http://info.msnbc.com/_news/2016/03/30/35330907-full-transcript-msnbc-town-hall-with-donald-trump-moderated-by-chris-matthews?lite)

Here is the problem: Trump **only** uses simple language and implications in his speech patterns. This method allows the audience to draw mainly their own conclusions on "what he *really* means." It is also why he contradicts himself so often. The way he speaks is *purposefully* unclear, because it allows the listener to project whatever meaning they want onto the words.  This is great for some things, and many politicians do this for issues they don't want to be direct about.

However, the nuclear option is *NOT* one of those issues.

Any *real* politician knows some issues you have to be VERY VERY clear about. 'Nukes' being at the top of that list. But, Trump only has one mode of speaking. He only has one speed. So, when he *tries* to talk about nukes, he uses his simple language. This allows the audience to draw their own conclusions. 

Those conclusions range between: *"He'll only use it if he absolutely has no other choice"* to *"He'll blow everyone up if they look at him funny."*

When we remember 'the audience' in this case means 'every other country, from Japan to Russia to England' this is very very *BAD.* We don't want these countries 'drawing their own conclusions.' We absolutely **need** our leader to be *direct* on some complex ideas. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem with all of the evil games I've run (except one) was that the party would implode and kill each other. Experienced RP players seem even more prone to this outcome. They feel like an evil character *SHOULD* kill other people for profit or pride. That's the downside of being evil: lack of cohesion. Evil people don't have congruent morals to keep them all on the same page.

The only evil game I ever ran that didn't have this problem, I made all of the characters worship the same god: Myrkul. They all lived in a temple to the god of death, and had for most of their lives. I had them write up a back story about why they lived there, and then I made it one of my goals as the DM to really give them reasons to be loyal to Myrkul. I wove into the intro to the story that Myrkul had shown *favoritism* to them in one way or another (dependent on their personal backstory). And, I never gave them reason to doubt Myrkul's confidence in them. Later, as I am want to do, I did have a particularly powerful [Asura](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/asura) (*Onamahli the Twice Pure*) try to turn them on each other. But, I made sure they had a strong base before I tried to tear them apart.

I know quite a bit about the 40k storyline. And, I think it would probably be a good idea if you made sure all of them work for the same god. Having the same god gives them commonality in philosophy they'll not have otherwise. Nurgle, for example, is very fatherly to his followers and could inspire loyalty. But, Nurgle can't inspire loyalty in an Slaanesh follower. Sounds like you're in Fantasy, but in 40K a Khorne Berzerker would much rather kill a Sorcerer of the Thousand Sons then help him.

But, if they (and you) really want to have them worship different gods (which I don't recommend). I think it would be super important you give them a very very strong reason to work together. Some overarching goal or enemy were they *need* each other (the Star Child?). Their gods can even tell them they **have** to work together or face their ire. 

The problem I had with this method was that the party fell apart during side quests. If you remove the pressure of why they are working together for a few nights (because side quests happen) they forget why they're not stabbing one another for XP and loot.

**tl;dr:** Make sure they have really good, sustainable, and strong reasons for them to all work together, else you'll have a TPK and/or a bunch of characters that can't play together anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been consistent in asking about how I would act if I lived in Greyhawk. At least, that is how its been in my head. I don't know if I explained it well.

So, it is *both* "in game" and "out of game." As in: what if you put a person from out of the game into the game? I think this is important because Greyhawk doesn't have the same physics and metaphysics as the real world. It wouldn't be realistic to be an atheist in Greyhawk, for example. Morality would function differently their.

But, in both your posts you were talking about a DnD creationist world. So, I don't know how you say you flipped worlds. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Free Will in 5th Ed </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The discussion on the inherent alignment of some races in the context of free will got me thinking of this quote from 5th Ed:

*"For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.*

*The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god's influence.)*

*Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn't tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil."*

To what extant do the races with "alignment tendencies" have free will? Does nature more than nurture play a part in the choices of some fantasy races? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's interesting to have you talk about the historical view of morality over the modern scientific one as having more relevance in DnD. But, then switch to favoring the more modern perspective over an historical one.

I'm not judging. I'm rereading some of my responses and seeing some of my own flipflops. I really am just trying to ask provocative questions to get the chance to read what people think. I don't think there is a "right" answer, in the context of DnD anyway (other than 'Rule Zero'). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have, actually, already studied those. Moral philosophy is a hobby of mine, and most of the books on tape I listen to (as well as the wiki pages I read) pertain to that subject. I only studied it a bit in college, however, my focus was math and physics. 

As I am sure comes out a little in the second half of my OP, I (generally speaking) subscribe to the [science of morality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_of_morality) and ethical naturalism. Though, my particular brand is nuanced.

But, these questions are more meant to be in the context of Greyhawk. As in, what would I think if I lived in Greyhawk. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Moral Justifications of the Genocide of 'Evil' Races </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-27 22:19:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was in a Greyhawk campaign (3.5) playing as a Cleric worshiping Pelor. We found a group of goblins, who we killed. One of the other characters, a Paladin, said we should have given them a chance to surrender. This sparked a debate between him and I about whether or not goblins in Greyhawk were inherently evil, and -thus- if their genocide was morally justifiable. My character believed that it was.

I had two main arguments, one was spiritual and the other genetic.

From a spiritual standpoint, there are no good goblin gods in Greyhawk. This meant to my character that spiritually, goblins -as a race- were evil. They had no moral compass to guild them that didn't point in the wrong direction. While individual goblins might turn to other races' gods, the goblin race as a whole was irredeemable. In short, their souls were inherently evil as represented by their pantheon.

From a genetic stand point, human morals evolved from our particular pack mentality. Our capacity for altruism (and other actions we consider 'moral') come directly from our evolution as a social animal. If goblins had a different evolutionary path (as my character believed) their morals would not be coherent with ours. The actions of goblins showed their societal instincts weren't -in anyway- "moral." They were -genetically- an "evil" race, as the system the DnD characters find themselves in defined such terms as 'good' and 'evil.' 

Since the DnD system has defined 'good' and 'evil,' within that system one can see goblins are inherently "evil." Thus, my character felt the wholesale slaughter of their races is not only morally justifiable, but a moral imperative.

Is genocide morally justifiable in these circumstances? </TEXT>

Trumps businessmen sense will actually be a detriment to him here. Did you know he suggested we should pay off our debt by declaring bankruptcy?

It would be especially bad for the US, because the stability of the dollar is one of the only reasons people invest in us.

But, I think we might be talking past each other. I'm not pro-(*anygrouppromotingmurder*). Any group--religious or otherwise--that promotes murder I am against. But, Islam no more **inherently** promotes murder than Christians do just because their Holy Text says *"Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the LORD your God must be put to death."*

I don't feel there is sufficient evidence that a blanket persecution of Muslims would have a significant impact in mitigating murder. But--of course--I am saying countries should be doing everything they can to persecute *ISIS* members, just not Muslims in general.  </TEXT>

Let me be clear. Murder is not OK. Murderers are not OK. No one here is saying it is OK. I'm not saying it; you're not saying it. The argument isn't whether or not murder is acceptable. Murder is not acceptable.

The debate is over whether or not persecuting a subsection of the population would have a significant impact in mitigating this unacceptable practice.

Lets say there is a police report out there saying "1,900 victims  1,200 of whom were sexually assaulted  and police stated that at least 2,000 men were involved, acting in groups.

Depends on what you mean by "one act of anger." I'm pretty sure one act of anger IS all it takes, depending on the act. Just like one act of murder is all it takes to be a murder, one act of sedition to be a seditionist.

<TEXT>  It's EXPLICIT that racism involves treating another race differently BECAUSE you think your race is superior. 

I recommend you actually read the full definition. The first definition in most dictionaries say something about 'superior,' but the second definition normally just says "racial prejudice or discrimination." An example of which would be not letting someone drink at a water fountain because of their race, or not letting them into an awards ceremony for the same reason.

That's why people in non-power positions in society, can't be racist because there is no mechanism in place for them to exact that perceived superiority over another race. 

You don't need a "mechanism in place for them to exact that perceived superiority over another race" to be racist. If that was the case, Hitler wasn't racist when he wrote *Mein Kampf,* since he was in jail at the time and lacked agency to follow through on his views. Yet, I'm not sure how anyone could read that book and think it wasn't written by a racist. I mean, go look how people describe that book. 'Racist' is used a lot. Anyway, even under your definition, the awards ceremony would certainly be considered a "mechanism in place for them to exact that perceived superiority over another race." Proving superiority is pretty much the point of most awards ceremonies.

They can be prejudiced and bigoted, but by definition can't be racist.

Sigh... "bigoted" is a *synonym* of "racist." Again, if you have an issue with this semantic fact, I recommend you take it up with Merriam-Webster (or whatever your preferred dictionary is) and ask them to remove the secondary definition of the word.

Don't cheapen the definition of the word because you feel like throwing it around. It seems that you need to take it up with the dictionary.

This is ironic because I am the one that started this conversation by quoting the *actual* definition of the word. But, as is indicative of dramatic irony, I guess I can't expect you to see the humor in it.

Anyway, I am done with this **literal** semantic argument. I am well beyond caring if you will accept the given definition of the term or not. </TEXT>

But, look, regardless of anything else, if you hold that members of different races *should be* treated differently (for good reasons or bad), then I'm going to call you racist, because that's what the word 'racist' means.  

If you have a problem with that, take it up with the dictionary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whether or not you realize it, your logic is essentially the same people that advocated for 'separate but equal' used. That as long as the organizations enacting such social norms *think* the races are equal, they should be allowed to segregate them.

Now, I'm not saying **people** have to have diversity in their friend choices. People -certainly- are free to choose who they hangout with. If the only reason you don't want to hang out with me is the color of my skin, I'm not going to picket the white house.

But, I am saying -historically- when **organizations** make discriminatory choices or rules based *solely* on race, it hasn't been a good thing.

But, since I don't really know what the goal of BET is (or -really- anything about it other than that one commercial I saw a few years back and what I've read on this thread) I can't accurately comment on it being 'good' or 'bad' in pursuit of that unknown -to me- goal.

For example, if instead of attempting to minimizing racism, their real goal is to make money filling a niche entertainment market, then I would *guess* (again, with next to no information) that they're likely doing a **good** job. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But, 'think' is the problem. Just as an example, plenty of people *genuinely* thought that segregation in the South was justified, not because one race was necessarily better than another, but because black and white people were different. Thus, we got the term 'separate but equal,' which the supreme court ruled against in *Brown v. Board of Education.*

Whether or not you realize it, you are essentially arguing that there is nothing wrong with 'separate but equal.' That as long as people enforcing such rules *think* the races are equal, then they should be allowed to *physically* segregate them. </TEXT>

The best way to "make gold" is in a supernova, but it's one of the rarer metals to be created in those explosions. While we might get more gold as we get better at mining (on and off of the planet), it will ALWAYS be one of the rarer metals, because it is rare in the universe.  So, we might eventually get to the point were we have an overabundance of *EVERYTHING* we need, but -even then- we will have a smaller overabundance of gold. Simply because less of it **exists** than other substances. (Not that there aren't even rarer metals) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, alright, if you want to talk about points:

I feel everything within the comic is valid. You are correct about different aspects of the arguments, but those arguments aren't presented in the comic. 

I also understand the concept of the slippy slope fallacy, but the *logic* behind many of the arguments for homosexuality can be used for incest between consenting adults. Are they the same? No. Does the comic claim they are the same? No. In fact, the punchline RELAYS on the fact they're different. To claim the comic is saying they're the same is to strawman what is being said. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Abiogenesis occurred on ancient Earth when it was in a volatile state. Reactions occurring all over its surface finally gave rise to ones that were self-propagating. From there, evolution took over and 4 billion years later, here we are.

The Sun is much larger and more volatile than the Earth ever was, so why didn't abiogenesis occur there? It wouldn't be self-replicating amino acids, but maybe something like self-replicating plasma structures. 

Remember that the Sun -in galactic terms- isn't much older than Earth, 4.57 billion years to 4.54 billion years. Then think about how long it took Earth life to evolve intelligence and climb out of the Earth's gravity well. Think about how much different Earth's environment is to space, and the precautions we need to take to survive there.

Now, think about how much GREATER the Sun's gravity well is. How RIDICULOUSLY different the Sun's environment is to space. </TEXT>

It's not "mean words on the *internet*." It's "mean words on a *privately owned site*." If someone walked up to my lawn a posted a sign on it I didn't agree with, no one would say I was against free speech if I took it down. That's what's happening now. The owner of this house is choosing what kinds of signs can get posted *on their property.*

Now, I'm all for people boycotting something if they don't like it, and if people want to do that they should. But, people seem to forget this site is *owned,* and making spam posts just to make them is akin to spray painting a wall you don't own.

<TEXT>  I just said I don't think there's a connection between Cainhurst Castle/maidens with the Pthumerian Queen. Byrgenwerth is a whole separated story.

And I was just saying the connection between Cainhurst Castle and the Queen is **Byrgenwerth**. 

Alfered tells us "*Well, once a group of young Byrgenwerth scholars discovered a holy medium deep within the tomb. This led to the founding of the Healing Church, and the establishment of blood healing. In this sense, everything sacred in Yharnam can be traced back to Byrgenwerth.*"  We can also assume it all started with the Queen's miscarriage, in old Byrgenwerth. And the Cainhurst Vilebloods brought the Old Blood out of Byrgenwerth in order to become Vilebloods. "*In Cainhurst Castle, Queen Annalise was a ruler over many nobles and dandies, she is the first Vileblood that partaked in corrupted blood from Byrgenwerth.*" </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're claiming the connection in dress is just because they were lazy in design. But, why would they parade the lazy design around by making it an equipable item with its own lore description attached?  To me, it is much more likely they did that so it would be easier to make the connections between those that wear it. If it was "generic female clothing #74" (like the Hags wear) they'd not give it its own lore description (like they didn't with the Hag clothing).

You say that its just symbolism that the Queen is seen in the lake. I agree that it's symbolism, but not in the way you seem to  think it is. If the Queen wasn't associated with Byrgenwerth in some way, they would have no reason to show her there. When they do cut scenes, they are not limited by location. You're in the church when you touch the skull, but the scene you see isn't. Additionally, the player is about to be teleported to Yahar'gul. There is no reason for the Queen scene to have her standing in the middle of Byrgenwerth's lake unless they waited her to be right there. To me, this scene shows that **everything** really and truly started in Byrgenwerth, right down to the original miscarriage of the Queen. 

I'm not saying that the OP has everything right, but I don't think everything you claim is unintended coincidence is unintended coincidence. </TEXT>

we don't see any other female (commoner, not in a faction) character in the game.

I don't think they'd give you the dress, with no other parts to that set, for no reason. They want you to make the connection or why bother making it equitable gear? </TEXT>

If you don't see the difference between killing someone and letting them go "scott free," then I don't think I'm going to be able to explain it to you.

If you murder someone, you now owe a debt both to society and to the individual you murdered. You can be rehabilitated before being released to pay back society, but you must be punished to pay back the individual.

Didn't we establish you can't pay back the dead?

<TEXT>  I said that because you are advocating for "rehabilitating" violent murderers at the expense of justice. 

I've been saying:

If a person is doing something that's damaging society, like raping babies, they should be removed from society until they're no longer likely to damage society. This can be accomplished by killing them or removing them to try and fix them.[[1]](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/32875g/mother_gets_20_years_in_prison_for_killing_son_by/cq91pye)

Not that I really should expect you to know what I've been saying at this point.....

I don't believe in punishment for damaging society. I believe that punishment should come as a result of damage to individuals. 

Yet, you said the American court system is about punishment, and you hoped it would stay like that. Not that it would change so that only crimes you -personally- don't like get 'punished.'

Anyway, this system you're talking about is stupid. YI should be allowed to drink a bottle of rum while going 80 in a 25; as long as I get lucky, no problem. I should be allowed to swing a loaded gun around next to a schoolyard, as long as it doesn't go off, no biggy. If I plot to kill someone, but screw it up so bad no one is hurt, no harm no fowl. Better luck next time. I want to bring a bomb on a plane, why not? I'm not going to set it off or something, lighten up. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Maybe you should be advocating for rehabilitation for these people, who can repay their debt both to society and their victims and carry on in peace.

I've advocating for the rehabilitation of all criminals. **You** said:

 But remember, the purpose of the (adult) court systems in America is primarily to punish, not to rehabilitate. **Hopefully it will stay that way.**

The court system isn't just for murderers, it's for criminals. Or, -in addition to not knowing what 'prove' or 'rehabilitation' means- do you also not know what "criminal" and "court system" means? 

What we -collectively- agree damages society we call 'crime.' It might be driving recklessly, stealing, or murder, but -whatever- we feel it isn't behavior that we want people doing. We have a system for dealing with this, one I think should be about prevention/rehabilitation and you've been saying should be about making emotionally hurt people feel better. 

Well, some people get really upset when people smoke weed, and they feel better when they know those people are punished. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You seem to misunderstand what I'm saying. I'm not saying we shouldn't work on rehabilitating them while in prison, only that they should be adequately punished for crimes where they've hurt another person very badly.

You are saying that punishing them is more important. I would be *nice* to have more useful members in society, but not as important as punishment. Indulging your righteous anger is what really matters, and making them a productive member of society is a secondary issue. Thus, I would assume once your need for revenge is slaked, you would want them released. If they 'learned their lesson' during that time wouldn't be as important.

Also, it's much cheaper for society to kill them quickly (without 10,000 appeals) than it is for us to bother rehabilitating them.

Then do that. If they **really** can't be effectively fixed, then I would be more included to permanently remove them. But, honestly, I would also be included to permanently remove people that truly believe society should indulge its rage and hatred to prove dead people mattered.

 And in the (fairly likely) chance that they offend again, was it worth it? 

If they're 'fairly likely' to do it again, they're not rehabilitated are they?  I will remind you, YOU are the one more inclined to release people who are "fairly likely to do it again," since weather or not they'll do it again is less important to you than them getting punished to your satisfaction. Weather or not they're "fairly likely to do it again" is my **ONLY** concern, it's your secondary concern.

They don't care, but we should. Would you be okay with the "rehabilitated" murderer literally going up to this kid's corpse and spitting on it? Why not, if he's dead?

That's my question. If the person *really* and *truly* is rehabilitated -and will positively add to society for the rest of their days- why does it matter if they spit on dead people?

It's to show that we cared for them. For us

If we really care, then we know we care. Why do we have to prove we care to people that already know we care? Seems like a wasted effort all around.

 she thought that attention was worth more than her child's life.

And, you think indulging in your hatred and anger is more important than her life.  You're not doing it for society; you're doing it for yourself, just like she was.

<TEXT>  Why do we owe it to ourselves? How does it benefit anyone other than them? 

(More people in society helping society, and using money to get more people in society to help society)  (Society using money to punish people for no other reason than to punish them, and then releasing them when convinced they're sufficiently punished without really caring if they're likely to be productive or harmful after being released.)

the kid has just ceased to exist forever because of her actions I think that's sufficiently horrible that she doesn't deserve forgiveness from us.

Then why say "That's spitting in the face of the dead kid?" Why would dead people care if you spit on them? Why even have the PRETEXT for doing it "for the children?" If you don't think people can care after death, why should we be wasting resources *for* dead people's feelings?

Honestly, I just assumed you were religious because I can't reconcile your view otherwise. Why use the living's resources to further damage already mentally damaged people to take revenge for dead people that can't possibly care anymore? </TEXT>

Anyway, killing or hurting the baby's mother isn't going to help the baby. Even in this response you seem to be admitting you want the mother punished because of how YOU feel, not because of how the dead child feels.  You would take revenge for yourself, not for the child. Getting mad and than acting on that anger isn't the best way to show you care.

But, why should we *try* and help her? Because she **might** not be beyond help; the child certainly is. If there was some way to help the child as well, I would be all for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry, I thought the question was meant to relate to the first one so I was just answering the first one. If a person is doing something that's damaging society, like raping babies, they should be removed from society until they're no longer likely to damage society. This can be accomplished by killing them or removing them to try and fix them.

However "taking revenge" doesn't address the underlying issue, nor does it help those already hurt or dead. I get as mad as the next person when I hear about children getting hurt, but I also realize lashing out in anger often causes more problems than it fixes.  I don't think dangerous people should be walking around, but I also think we should be removing them from society for the right reasons. Not because we're mad and want to "make them pay" for making us mad.

I can understand the value of "making an example," but I know that only works if the people you're making an example *to* are rational. Crazy people are -by definition- not rational. Hurting them to make ourselves feel better about their irrational behavior accomplishes nothing. You can't 'fix' crazy people by punishing other crazy people in front of them, and hurting them for "revenge" is misguided. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm asking questions, not making statements. Therefore, I can't be making "strawman arguments." (It could be possible for a question to be a '[loaded question](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_question),' but I'm pretty sure I wasn't doing that either.)

Anyway,

You are claiming people are misrepresenting your point. I am genuinely trying to ascertain what your point IS, since you claim no one is representing it properly. How about you rephrase it in a way I might be able to understand instead of misusing logical fallacies -like 'strawmen' accusations- as [red herrings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring) from the main question?

 (That **is** a loaded question, but I'm using it to try and get you to restate your point, since no one but you seems to understand what it is. To be more direct: What is your point?) </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the article I linked:

Social conceptions and groupings of races vary over time, involving folk taxonomies[4] that define essential types of individuals based on perceived traits. Scientists consider biological essentialism obsolete,[5] and generally discourage racial explanations for collective differentiation in both physical and behavioral traits.[6][7][8][9][10]

See how Wiki links, in that one section, **7** different papers? I don't expect you to trust wiki itself, but I do expect you to trust the 7 different papers it's citing. Honestly, when I worked in research, and we used wiki *as a starting point* quite often. But, that was the field of Physics and wasn't controversial. I will admit I don't know the reliability of wiki in something controversial like this, but I would expect if they have 7 different citations, it's probably not as bad as your "LOL" makes it out to be.

Regardless, I am very aware of things like the *Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study* and was planning on linking [Race and intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence) earlier, but I guess I'm glad I didn't because of the "LOL WIKI LOL" reaction I just got... 

Anyway, none of this is really the issue, because there are glaring errors in the very premise of your point, which is why I don't find merit in it. I don't know -objectively- if race affects IQ, but I do know -objectively- contradictory reasoning can't be correct.  And, you're using contradictory reasoning in that you're claiming social scientists aren't reliable, **but you're still relying on them.** So, while your conclusion could -in some objective sense- be right, your reasoning in obtaining that conclusion is fundamentally flawed. It's your **reasoning** I've been taking issue with. Let me see if I can elaborate further.

One of the central premises you're using to draw the conclusion you're drawing is social studies is -itself- unreliable. As you -yourself- put it: "The problem with social studies is that people pick and choose which contextual elements to emphasize, and do so with considerable bias." Within that, you also seem to feel any social scientists that rejects the idea their studies lead to evidence that race affects IQ is emotionally biased (ignoring the fact YOU could be bias in making this assumption). That "those explanations causes emotional distress among many who work in the field of social studies." However, these emotional clods are the very people you're relying on. You seem to be of the opinion you understand their data better than the people trained to collect and analyze it. Worse still, you have no data to back the assumption social scientists are temperamental dullards. You don't even have circumstantial evidence (I assure you, poor blacks aren't funding their research). But, your reasoning still goes further downhill from this shaky premise.

You're hypothesis is saying that this bias and inexact science can somehow *still* ferret out the slight difference -if it exists- in psychology between human phenotypes. That the raw data, "FBI crime statistics," somehow overcomes the error from education, test bias, stereotype threat, socioeconomic environment, etc. to reveal the underlying signal under all of the noise. That you -the layman- have more insight than the bumbling emotional experts that -literally- have the answers in their laps (since they're the ones that compile said data). That you have *special insight* and have seen the hard science that lies at the bottom of the statistical noise that is this soft science. But, I think the error bars from all the crap in the raw data only leads to "no conclusion." Raw data are normally just junk until you process it. 

That's what experts are FOR: finding the slight signal under a mountain of noise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, because scientists (biologists) -not *social* scientists- have declared 'race' mainly a human construct, with actual genetic differences superficial at best.[[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_%28human_classification%29) Next you'll be telling me brown eyed people are genetically predetermined to be better pianists than blue eyed people, since that -like skin pigmentation- is also a difference in phenotype.

I will also go on to say what I -really- don't find merit in is someone telling me I should ignore people with experience and evidence on the assumption that all of them are bias, simply because they disagree with this person's [Special Pleading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading) argument. An argument he claims doesn't require as much (or any) evidence since this person is seemingly convinced he is without bias -or at least 'less' than all said experts- (which is a good indication he is so biased he doesn't even have the self-awareness to realize he's bias).

If we're being honest, you sound like a conspiracy theorist. You should turn your critical blue eyes on your own argument and expect the same level of rigor from it as you do those you've been criticizing as 'bias.' </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, you're using social studies to draw the conclusion, while simultaneously explaining how social studies -as a whole- are bias in their conclusions.

How are you squaring that circle? How are claiming social studies can't be used to draw conclusions, but also claiming you've found a way to do just that?  Are you claiming you have some silver bullet way of interpreting this data none of the *actually* experts have? That you're some kind of "meta-expert?"

And -again- you've brought a lot of fancy words to the table explaining your distrust of experts, but you've still failed to do what I originally asked you do to: Bring some **evidence** for your claims.

You keep saying things like:

Now, I guarantee you that one of those explanations causes emotional distress among many who work in the field of social studies.

Except -in 40k- "magic" has a definition, and the Necron's tec doesn't fall into it. That's all I'm saying. I'm not saying Necron tec doesn't break OUR definition of physics or that it isn't "unbelievable" or "incredible." I am just saying "magic" -in 40k- means "uses the Warp," and the Necrons -canonically- don't. They -canonically- are anathema to the Warp. Thus, IMO you shouldn't call their tec "magic."

Also, they LOST their souls when they become Necrons. Their souls were not transferred into their new bodies, only their memories. 

The Necrontyr may now be immortal and unified, but they had lost their souls in the process. Thus the soulless machines known as the Necrons were born. [[2](http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Necron)]

That's kinda the whole point of the Necron race. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are not Borg.

But -seriously- each borg has a personal force field. I'm sure they could modulate it -or whatever- to prevent themselves from getting pulled apart. Necron tec might take them awhile to assimilate to adapt correctly, but maybe not. Borg are better with the purely mechanical than they are with the purely organic, as was shown by 8472. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One on One. I would like to know how [Dr. Doom](http://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/26ufq7/respect_dr_doom/) would do against 'normal' Space Marine.

Then, if people have time, I would like to know how a 'hero' Space Marine -like  [Cato Sicarius](http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Cato_Sicarius) or [Ahzek Ahriman](http://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/2fouvk/respect_ahzek_ahriman_lord_of_the_thousand_sons/)- would do against Dr. Doom. If Dr. Doom gets minions in the fight, then so does the Astartes (same #).  

A siege battle would also be interesting: A [Chapter](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131024175349/warhammer40k/images/1/12/UM_Astartes_Ultra.png) of Astartes making plans to invade Latveria. </TEXT>

Then, if people have time, **I would like to know how a 'hero' Spartan -like [Master Chief](http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/John-117)- would do against an 'average' Space Marine;** how a 'hero' Space Marine -like [Cato Sicarius](http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Cato_Sicarius)- would do against an 'average' Spartan; then Hero vs Hero.

*(And we are talking 'normal' Space Marines, not Primarchs, Terminators, or even Psykers)*

<TEXT> My first "test" character used a +5 Craftsman Hammer. I like the smaller weapons because they're faster.  Why the Mastodon Greatsword or the like instead of something already infused with dark, like Scythe Of Nahr Alma? *(though, I'm not sure I like the Scythe's move set)* The Mastodon Greatswors wasn't even on my radar; what am I missing about it?

Would the INT be at 60 just for the extra orb for Affinity? I think at that point I would just drop both to 50, but I am thinking about either 60 or 50 for both, depending on how many points I need. Dropping them from 67 to 58 would give me the points I need to get my STR to 40. I like the idea of the Sacred Chime. But, [the wiki I was reading](http://darksouls2.wikidot.com/crypt-blacksword) said a Dark Crypt Blacksword has **S** scaling in Dark. So, that seems like the way to go.


Any suggestions on armor? I keep reading conflicting data on it. Should I be pumping VIT and wearing something heaver? </TEXT>

I'm just worried if I start de-specializing at this point, then higher level guys will start to trounce me. Is this fear unjustified?

**Solis**  *(Lv: 246 Soul Lv: 13555544)*


| Stat   | Value    | Notes
:-----------|:------------|:------------------------------------
VGR | 20 | (First Soft Cap)
EDN | 20 | (First Soft Cap)
VIT | 5 | *(Meh? I'm at 69.4%)*
ATN | 60 | *([Cast Speed Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATSZSEk4dj8))*
STR | 20 | (First Soft Cap)
DEX | 20 | (First Soft Cap)
ADP | 20 | *([This video is compelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrymfvwDv0))*
INT | 67 | *(69 w/ Helm)*
FTH | 67 | *(69 w/ Helm)*

Right Weapon: Dark Berserker Blade +5 *(should be Washing Pole, working on it)*; Dark Sunset Staff +5; Dark Bow of Want +5

Left Hand: Dark Black Witch's Staff +10; Defender's Shield +5

Armor: Black Hood +5 *(effective +4 levels? Yes, please)*; Black Witch Robe +5; Lion Mage Cuffs +10; Blood-Stained Skirt +10

Rings: Ring of Life Protection;  Clear Bluestone Ring +2 *(Cast Speed goes from 154 to **343**)*; Covetous Gold Serpent Ring +2; Covetous Silver Serpent Ring +2 *(used Bonfire Ascetic to get at NG, never took it off)*

-------

I normally go Berserker Blade Witch's Staff mobile/versatile attacks, rolling to avoid damage. Occasionally, I will go Sunset Staff Defender's Shield and just Dark Orb my way to victory. The bow is a back up poison delivery system if I need to aggro/kill something I can't target. The short range on Berserker Blade is making me want to switch to a Washing Pole, despite the lower damage. But, I need to level one up first.

So, as you can see I've double down on Dark *(Dark BNS: 188)*, but I am wondering if just putting points into INT and FTH is the right plan at this point (I am thinking of getting both to 70 and then getting ATN to 75). I hit the first soft caps in the other stats to get more bang for my buck. But, I am wondering if I shouldn't be redistributing my points a little, since I'm well into the last soft cap in INT and FTH. 

-------

Should I get VGR, EDN, or ADP to the next soft cap? Should I put more into DEX for more damage/Phys DEF? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You did not directly address the logical construction from my last post. Additionally, we've--apparently--gotten to the point in the discussion where we repeat ourselves. Since I'm convinced I already understand what you're saying, I'm just going to reiterate my point one last time and then likely stop responding; assuming you don't bring anything new or of interest in your next post (this current post of yours did not).

That people of race x should be kill is opinion not fact, correct. But, that the hypothetical person THINKS people of race x should be kill IS a fact. If facts can't be racist, then that fact about the person's thoughts isn't racist. However, I disagree with this definition of racism. I feel "racism" means what the word's etymology implies it means. Mainly, **any** delineation based solely on race; facts or otherwise; derogatory or otherwise; good, bad, or ugly; and any and all. (And--yes--this means I think everyone is 'racist' when it comes to certain things.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did. However, it would true that you think that. It might not be true that all people of race X should be killed. But, if you think they should, then--tautologically--it's true that you think they should.

Thus, if only false things can be racist, then that truth can't be racist.  

However, I would say it is racist. So--from Proof by Contradiction--one of the starting axioms must be incorrect. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, I would. I--in fact--call my self a "speciest" because I know I make decisions based on the species of a thing. ('Racist' being when someone makes a decision based on the race of the person in question.)  But, if you want to think I'd not, that's fine. I can't prove to you I would since no one has ever brought up similar statistics for white people in my presence in a setting where my response would be recorded.

I would just like to go on to say that I don't know why you feel only non-facts would be "racist." If someone were to say--for example--"I *think* everyone of race X should be killed" would that not be 'racist' if it is true they do really *think* that? Seems like a perversion of the term.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right, which is why I could see her doing it for the betterment of her people. 

However, I don't agree 18 is an "arbitrary" age; certainly not if that's the age she has been for hundreds of years. Also, regardless of how quickly other candy people age, they do age. Whatever BP has going on to keep herself the same age for hundreds of years, she is the only one using it. She tried and failed to cure death in her subjects, but whatever she is using on herself, she is keeping it to herself. Why? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It doesn't make sense that she has a "sweet spot" which she bounces back to when she takes on candy biomass.

Why not? I don't think it would make sense that absorbing more essence would make her old and decrepit. 

Other candy people age, it's very odd that she does not. I think its safe to assume she mush have some extraordinary way of remaining young, something other candy people wouldn't have access too.

I would assume she can replace aging body parts with fresher parts, much in the same way rich people can get new organs.[[1](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=1514702)] Since it's been established that "candy biomass" is essentially interchangeable between candy people, I don't see why she wouldn't be able to get those fresher parts from her subjects. And, she seems egotistical enough to justify and action like that because "her people need her" (and in some sense they do, since they mostly all act more or less like children. Also, she can always clone more.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Makes her older? That's one way of looking at it, I guess. Absorbing candy biomass reset her to **18** again, which in *that case* did make her physically older. However, we don't know for sure if she was *already* physically older than 18 that absorbing more candy biomass would make her even older (which seems silly to me) or if it would reset her back to 18 as it did before (which I find more likely).

This isn't to say I don't find your point value; it's just not how I interpreted that event. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Memories are very very Unreliable.[[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases#Memory_errors_and_biases)] It is not uncommon for people to "invent" whole stories that never happened to them, and then truly believe they did. If you did what was done to the mouse to a human, I am sure they would likely start to truly believe the shock occurred in room A, not room C. Maybe, if they were presented evidence otherwise, they might start to realize they were misremembering, but otherwise I am sure they would swear under oath it was win room A.[[2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyewitness_memory)]

<TEXT> [Commenting on the whole set.](http://imgur.com/a/Tff8B#0)

I'm ok with the color pie violations for flavor reasons, but the set is clearly unbalanced in blue's favor. 

I also did not like the vanilla 1/1's. Could you not have made them [Icatian Javelineers](http://magiccards.info/me2/en/15.html) or something?

The mono-colored lands were pretty bananas. I would be first picking them even if I was not in their colors since all of the activations are colorless. The one that lets you draw a card for 2 every turn? Or tutor for a guy for 2 every turn? Crazy.

There was very little to proliferate other than planeswalkers. If you going to make a recurring mechanic like that it would be better to make it more useful. Maybe have the cards also add a counter to something themselves and then proliferate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They mentioned that he is like that because the chaotic nature of red mana rejects lots of the Phyrexian orthodox. 

"Access to all five of Mirrodin's mana-rich suns has led to diversification and disunity, damaging the Phyrexian singularity of purpose. Of all the energies Mirrodin introduced to the Phyrexian ethos, the mana from the red sun has been most challenging, because it's the force that lies behind the concepts of individualism, compassion, emotion, and freedom."

Also, I have no doubt if you'd spent all your paper money as a youth on silver instead of baseball cards you would have more paper money now, but that would have been true if you bought stock in Microsoft or Apple, or--ironically--magic cards.

You had no way of knowing silver would be worth so much paper money in the future.

The reason they're worth so much is because the game is still being played. Since the first two editions have drastically different borders, inking, and wording, most people that play the game can tell instantly how old your cards are. Having the older cards is a status symbol.  

Some of the older cards are so powerful in the game you can't use them in most tournaments, but some you can use in all tournaments because they have been reprinted(so you can use any edition of the card). Also, you can play with your friends and show off. People like showing off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Juzam is still expensive because it was once very playable and people like the card. However, you can see its price is more stable than other cards.

Basically, its worth a lot because its always been worth a lot and is something of a stasis symbol among older players. Otherwise just run [Plague Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/details.aspx?name=Plague%20Sliver). </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can find stories in your area [here](http://locator.wizards.com/).
Go on a Friday night to one and hang around a bit. Everyone always plays magic on Friday Night, they even have a name for it: FNM (Friday Night Magic).
You will find people to play, but depending on your area that might be a bit competitive for you. However, there should be people hanging around just having fun, especially in a big city like Philly.

You can check out [here](http://magiccards.info/search.html) for cards. There are quite a few more than are on the PC.  Different stores and people often have different rules about which you can use, called "formats."  However, you are allowed to use any cards from any edition and any language, assuming one version of the card is legal in the format. 

Example: In the "Standard" format, [Giant Growth](http://magiccards.info/rtr/en/125.html) is legal because it was printed in *Return to Ravnica.* If you have a [Japanese Super Series one](http://magiccards.info/sus/jp/8.html), it's still playable in all Standard games. The only exception would be if you found one that did not have a normal magic back *(or had a silver or gold border, but don't worry about that)*. 

I would check out what people are playing in your area before making any decisions. You might even be able to borrow some decks for a bit to get a feel for the 'real' version of the game. That's what I would do; see if you can borrow some decks and see what people you want to play with are playing with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess that's a fair enough point.  My understanding was that whole "dino bone" thing was believe to have been done as, or before, the world was created. So I had interpreted that comic on the right to be symbolic of something happening 'before' time started.

Therefor, the comic on the left would also be happening as the deistic God was setting everything up--setting the stage as it were--not happening after the play had started.

But, your response is measured and I can find nothing wrong with your interpretation. 

Anyway, the real point I was trying to get at was that dino bones coming from dinosaurs is more believable then any holy texts. So, if people were going to believe something was placed on Earth as a divine "which one of these things doesn't fit" test, I wish they believed it was the holy texts. </TEXT>

Anyway, yes, this comic is basically saying I wish religious people were all Diests. I know many Atheists feel that the shift from fundamentalism to Deism would not be enough. But, I have not known any Diests to perform deplorable acts in the name of their Watchmaker. Maybe I just never looked hard enough. Anyway, in the interest of full disclosure, I guess I better confess to being a Materialistic Diest myself, not an Atheist. So, there you go.  </TEXT>

So, either she and her buddy were cheating or they sold their soul for that sealed pool. One of the two.

I play a lot of magic and I saw the two of them around at big tournaments in the area for years. It always bothered me when I did. I mean, who cheats at a Cold Snap prerelease? (Not that I can say for certain they did, but 4 Gelid Shackles? and Zur?) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anyway, to respond in an actually helpful way.  First, were I you I would get to know the [magiccards.info](http://magiccards.info/search.html) search engine a bit.  It's good for finding things like "human barbarian" and also can give you an idea of price as well as where you could pick up the cards once you find them. 

Second, if you're asking if a deck such as that is "viable" it makes it sound like you want to, you know, **win** in your casual group.  Therefore, more information about your group would be helpful before useful recommendations could be made. Are your casual games more one-on-one or multiplayer, for example?  Is this for EDH or just for 60 card casual?  And, what kind of players do you have in your group? Are you trying to build a casual deck that can win against standard legal decks in-between FNM rounds? Or are you just playing against your brother's scarecrow deck or something?  

Little things like multiplayer vs one-on-one makes a HUGE difference in deck building strategy, especially for a red-deck-wins (RDW) deck like you are thinking of building. Cards like [Lovisa Coldeyes](http://magiccards.info/cs/en/90.html) are much more playable in a multiplayer game then in one-on-one because of the higher casting cost. RDWs are better one-on-one then in multiplayer games in general because they can deal a lot of damage very quickly, but then run out of gas. This is good in one-on-one when there is only one guy. If you focus all of your attention on one guy you can kill him, but then you are dead in the water for the rest of the game if there are more people in that game *(assuming you don't have access to cards like [Wheel of Fortune](http://magiccards.info/rv/en/184.html) or [the like](http://magiccards.info/avr/en/151.html))*. 

Assuming one-on-one, budget, and only humans I would be looking at something like:

4 [Keldon Marauders](http://magiccards.info/pc/en/102.html)

4 [Stormblood Berserker](http://magiccards.info/m12/en/156.html)

4 [Stonewright](http://magiccards.info/avr/en/157.html)

4 [Lightning Mauler](http://magiccards.info/avr/en/144.html)

3 [Gathan Raiders](http://magiccards.info/arc/en/40.html)

3 [Balduvian Horde](http://magiccards.info/dm/en/10.html)

2 [Fireblast](http://magiccards.info/vi/en/79.html)

4 [Browbeat](http://magiccards.info/tsts/en/56.html)

4 [Lightning Bolt](http://magiccards.info/m11/en/149.html)

4 [Lava Spike](http://magiccards.info/chk/en/178.html)

4 [Flame Rift](http://magiccards.info/ne/en/80.html)

4 [Teetering Peaks](http://magiccards.info/pd2/en/30.html)

16 Mountains

But, that's just off the top of my head, so take it with a grain of salt. You probably don't even need 20 lands in a deck like that. Also, you might want to pick up [Fire and Lightning](https://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/pdsfirelightning/productinfo) *(if you can find it cheap)* as a starting point. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My wife recently moved to NM while I finish up my degree. In the apartment complex she moved to a 20something male knocked on her door and tried to get her to buy some children's books from a website based on a laminated pamphlet he had.  He then started asking her questions about her current living arrangements and finished by asking for money.  She was a little shaken from the whole ordeal. One of my suggestions was that she take some shooting lessons. However, she isn't a US citizen (she is a permeant resident). She was telling me she would not be able to get a gun license in NM. 

Does anyone have any suggestions or knowledge about how to handle this situation?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This has been driving me nuts all day. I don't know anything about this game or know any of the players, but I want to know just to know.

At [2:04 he plays it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqUuALUbwAM#t=2m03s). I can't make out the card, but they call it a "Mox Prox." Every other card played in all the videos are given their proper name, so I don't know why they call it that. But, if it was a Mox it should have cost 1 because of [Thorn of Amethyst](http://magiccards.info/lw/en/262.html), and then have been counted because [Chalice](http://magiccards.info/mi/en/150.html) is at 0. It was in his [opening hand](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqUuALUbwAM#t=0m30s) we see when he was distressed, and he did not play it turn one. So, maybe it was a land, issue resolved. 

 BUT, in the next game he plays what seems to be the same card *(they again call it a "Mox Prox")* [after he already played and used a Wasteland](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11gvaMLgC28#t=0m52s).

So, what is going on? It is a land? Is it a Mox? Both? Neither? What the heck is a "Mox Prox?" Please, I just want to know...... </TEXT>

I would HATE for her to get ripped off when she does that, obviously, but I would **especially** not want her to hang on to them if they made her depressed, like it seems they do for the OP. 

I think it would be rather selfish of me to expect her to hang on to something that makes her sad, takes up space, and could be potentially worth something after I'm gone.  But, maybe that's just me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, find out what addition the oldest ones are (check the binder, the box you can probably just look for ones that 'look old'). This can be done pretty quick, [use this guild](http://www.abugames.com/Magic_the_Gathering_Edition_Guide.html). (Alpha/Beta/Unlimited cards are $$$, even though they often have crappy looking art)

As was said, if they are any from 1993-1998 then you might have something worth a lot.  Otherwise, you might want to plug a few of the cards in the binder into [this search](http://blacklotusproject.com/) and see what values you get back.

Now, this part is key.  Most players have all of their most value cards in a "deck."  The deck is probably in its own case somewhere. It normally is 60-100 cards.  So, if you have some smaller box inside of a larger box that has 60-100 cards, you might want to plug some of the names into that card searcher and see what you have.  When doing that look for cards with an [old copyright date](http://www.abugames.com/images/guidetoeditions/4th_Edition_Date.jpg), ones with a gold/red set symbol (see the guild for what a set symbol is), or ones with NO copyright date (those are normally worth the most).

If you don't find any cards worth something you care about, just take it to your local comic shop and sell them. If you find ones worth a bit (or ANY cards from Alpha/Beta/Unlimited or with no copyright date), you probably should post here again for more advice.  </TEXT>

Magic in 19981999 was largely a flurry of Tolarian Academys, Time Spirals, Windfalls, Dream Halls, Yawgmoth's Bargains... Plenty plenty. So... Mox Diamond (discarding Ancient Tomb)
Mana Vault, tap for 3 Voltaic Key (2 left), untap Mana Vault (1 then 4 after the re-tap) Lotus Petal (we'll leave that for now)
Tolarian Academy, tap for UUUU Time Spiral (2 floating, untap the Academy) After a Time Spiral drawing seven you could probably figure a way to win. It would probably involve Mind Over Matter (allowing repeated untaps of the Academy, eventually fueling Stroke of Genius and / or further Spirals). What turn, you ask?

<TEXT> If your cube is color balanced and everyone at the table doesn't like playing red -as you say- then any red card would be enough for me to play it knowing it would be wide open.

Other that that, without knowing the composition of your cube the question is unanswerable. In some cubes [Fireball](http://magiccards.info/m12/en/131.html) would be pick one pack one every-time, in others [Urabrask the Hidden](http://magiccards.info/nph/en/98.html) or [Bogardan Hellkite](http://magiccards.info/ddg/en/47.html) might not ever make the cut. In the sets with those cards, I would draft red if I saw them in pack one, but it's set dependent. If Hellkite was in Innistrad instead of Time Spiral I might not draft it because Innistrad is a faster format. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did not say it "should" be worth $25, I am saying he "should" be worth less because people are not using him to play magic, which is traditionally what one does with magic cards. 

I am also pointing out that if one rates something higher than one should because of inconsequential attributes, like -say- card type, instead of consequential attributes, like -say- playability, one is overrating that something.

Being an instant is better than being a sorcery, but that does not mean all instants are better than all sorceries. Assigning a higher value to a bad instant simply because some other instants are worth money would be **overrating** that bad instant. 
The same holds true for planeswalkers.  </TEXT>

I agree with you that no one should use things that were common practice 1500 years ago to justify how one acts in today's society; however, no one on this thread IS.  They are simply pointing out that at the time it was not **socially** wrong to act that way, and -in fact- might have been seen as practical. 

It is ignorant to judge someone as evil just because they lived in a time and place that did not have your enlightened sensibilities.

Due to the printing process, it is possible to get land cards in a rare, uncommon, or common card slot. The chance is approximately 3.31% for rares, 21.5% for uncommons and 38.02% for commons. This is because they put lands on all three printed sheets.

<TEXT> First, you need to relax. If you psych yourself out about how a PTQ is 'so much different' then an FMN you'll just end up being super-nervous and end up playing poorly.

Second, just remember to be polite, fair, but hard on your opponent. No take backs; some players at a PTQ might try to play to your soft-side if they think you have one. Some nice guys will not and will suck up any mistakes they make, but others might complain and try to play on your emotions. Remember, expect the same level of play out of your opponent that you would expect out of yourself, not the other way around.

Most importantly, always call a judge if you are unsure about something. **Do not** try to work it out with the other guy. If you're not sure about what the proper procedure for whatever just happened, always call a judge and ask.  That's what they're there for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Reassembling Skeleton](http://magiccards.info/m12/en/104.html) does not have a "regenerating ability." It has an ability that works only when it is in the graveyard. That ability does not care how it ended up in the graveyard, countered, destroyed, or milled makes no difference. So, if it is countered you can still pay 1B and put it into play.  You also don't have to do it right away, but can do it on a later turn.

Welding Jar cannot be used on an artifact that is being counted for two reasons. One, it can only target a permanent, which a creature on the stack is not. Two, regenerating means that the next time it is destroyed (by a destroy effect or lethal damage) instead it is tapped, removed from combat, and has all damage removed from it.  "Counting" is not the same as "destroying" so regeneration does not stop it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Atheism vs Religion: Survival of the Fittest! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-05-04 22:13:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was hoping we could talk about which people thought was more "evolutionarily sound," and let me explain what I mean by that. 
You can either be religious or atheistic, you can't be both. This means that both ideas are "competing for real estate" within a person's mind. As more people take up one idea, necessarily less people have the other. This is very analogous to natural selection within species, as one species beats out another to fill the same niche.

The "niche" here is human thought. 

As Robert Wright wrote in his book *The Evolution of God* we've seen this same kind of battle take place between religions. In the distant past, religion was clearly the way to think, since almost all human cultures evolved thinking it. You could not find a civilization *(higher than hunter/gather)* that did not have a form of religion. One religion would be better suited to get and convert more people, and as it did -necessarily- other religions shrink and were eventually replaced. The battle for the human soul, as it were. However, NOW more and more we are seeing a new "species" emerge in the form of atheism, and it too is competing for the same niche in human thought. Which will stick in the minds of men(and women) better? Which is more believable?

People are born without religion, but that form of nontheism is easily replaced with something else. That is the unthinking blank state of mind in which religion and other concepts can easily take root. I am not talking about that form of nontheism; I am talking about the "atheistic philosophy" *(as in, anything other than the "default" position)*; is IT more "fit" than religion? Is it better at converting people? Does it have what it takes to beat out religion? Or will it "die out" as many philosophies have before it? Or maybe religion will just die a natural death? </TEXT>

I was entertaining the idea you might be able to write an equation that could give you the relative power level of cards in upcoming sets with more of an objective feel to it. I think you're also correct in that just randomly assigning numbers to the different values isn't the way to go about it. I was hoping to do some more tweaking, but the equation started getting too long and I just gave up.  Which is when I posted it here.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read that article you are referring to and found it PR-sugarcoated.  I think it's clear why they canceled something as popular as Player Reward's, because of the abuses.  That they are planning on trying to find a less abusable way to make something as popular as Player Reward's, I have no doubt. That these kind of events at prereleases are an example of something they are trying -as you point out- I would also agree with.

In your post you seem to be saying that "useless" and "worthless" are the same thing. While the dice I got might not be worth $$$, I am planning on using them.  I find spindowns to be quite useful, if not worth money.  I do have a deck that [makes angels](http://magiccards.info/isd/en/213.html), so I should have a use for the tokens as well.  However, I understand your point about wanting something of value, which is the very reason I would like them to continue this kind of event. Maybe next time I will get something of value as well as something I can use.

As for the rest of your post, a mythic rare costs just as much to print as a common. Everyone likes opening mythic rares.  Wizards likes to keep some things in reserve in part so they can make more money. However, I -personally- don't hold the fact my Helvault didn't have any foils in it against Wizards anymore than I hold the fact I did not open any [Tamiyo's](http://magiccards.info/avr/en/79.html) in my packs.  Would I have liked to open a Tamiyo? Yes, but the fact that I did not makes the fact someone else did more special to them. I don't hold that against anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Player's rewards were not "traded" for anything.  They got rid of them because the system was too easy to abuse.  People would run lots of fake sanctioned tournaments and claim players XYZ were involved, when really no tournament was happening.  Wizards had to pick between making it harder to run sanctioned tournaments and harder to register players, or do away with the prizes for playing in them. A handful of people ruined it for everyone.

I am finding it more and more likely that Wizards will also not do any more events like the Helvault.  I hope reddit is not representative, but if it is I don't see why they would continue with a program that seems to be generating such bad PR. 

I hope they continue it because I like getting free stuff and would like a chance to get a foil one next time, but I seem to be in the minority. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [The Quintessential Mary-Sue](http://mrgreyman.deviantart.com/art/The-Quintessential-Mary-Sue-251827667) 

I attempted to capture the essence of this reoccurring wish fulfillment clich. I will accept any level of criticism; despite the nature of my work I do hope someday to produce something of value. This is not it, but I needed to get it out of my system.

There is also a [part two *word count:7797*](http://mrgreyman.deviantart.com/art/Mary-Sue-Part2-The-Three-Sues-254047856) and a [part three *word count:3320*](http://mrgreyman.deviantart.com/art/Mary-Sue-Final-Revelations-255491705) if the first wasn't enough for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Spectrum of theistic probability:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_of_theistic_probability#Dawkins.27_formulation)

* 1) Strong Theist; claims they *know* there is a God, without doubt.

* 2) Believes there is a God, but would not claim they know without doubt.

* 3) Weak Theist; uncertain, but feels a God is more likely than not.

* 4) Pure Agnostic; doesn't know and/or doesn't care. Finds the question ridiculous without presented evidence.

* 5) Weak Atheist; uncertain, but feels a god is more unlikely than not.

* 6) Believes there isn't a god, but would not claim they *know* without doubt.

* 7) Strong Atheist; claims they **know** there isn't a god, without doubt. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [ASK WIZARDS](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/activity/947)
 But in the past storyline, **the four Elder Dragons other than Nicol Bolas perished long ago**, so their chapter might be done. 

How can they just **casually** declare them dead like that?  There aren't even any stories *AT ALL* about [Arcades Sabboth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Discussion.aspx?multiverseid=1644), for example. Not one. </TEXT>
