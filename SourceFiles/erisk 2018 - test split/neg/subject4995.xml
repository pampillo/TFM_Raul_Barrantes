<TEXT> Ok I'm a pretty heavy set guy and it doesn't bother me really. So one time I was at one of my girlfriends family gatherings and her older cousin brings his new girlfriend (We'll call her "G") and she's pretty and in very good shape but she is very flat chested and just seemed to have a bad attitude. So a few hours pass and I've had a couple beers and we are all sitting around telling jokes and laughing. So G try's to roast me and the conversation goes like this.

G: Hey looks like you might need to borrow a bra for those tits.

Me: I don't need one and by the looks of it neither do you.

She got so mad she left and never came back over and the one time I did see her at Christmas she wouldn't say a word to me. </TEXT>

I felt like everything was in slow motion and I couldn't open my eyes because all I saw was lasers and I thought they'd shoot my eyes out if I opened them. So yeah after that I decided I didn't wanna mess with spice again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was five with pneumonia so bad if I didn't go to the ER that day I probably would have died at school. Also when I was eleven and I had an appendicitis my appendixes was so swollen that I they said I only had a few hours before it would have busted and probably killed me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Both of my freshman year math teachers got arrested for have sex with a student. My male math teacher would bring the girl in before class everyday to have sex before school started. She would still be there when I walked into the class for first period which I always thought was odd but after it came out and he turned himself in everything became clear. I feel bad for his fianc mostly because she came in to the class room very early one day and decorated the classroom and proposed to him in front of the whole class and I guess they were lucky that for some reason they didn't meet up that day. My female math teacher though was arrested for having sex with the quarterback mostly but at one point got gangbanged by a few football players. The worst part I think is that her kids are in this school system and everyone knew and gave them so much shit about and never yet them live it down. </TEXT>
