<TEXT> It's just assholish. I just realized that. I've been doing it so long, it's like breaking off a bad habit lol. But you what? It feels good, not tking anymore. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my chest. I mean, it's not like I was doing it all the time, but now that I never do it I can even see a slight difference in my gameplay, like I'm more serious so I get more kills. Woopeedoo! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was gifted Ready Player One by my wayward sister and I read 60 pages before I called it quits. I just read the key points on the Internet, and when she asked me about the book, I put on a fake smile and talked about how great it was. I suggest you do the same. I know this sounds assholish, but it's better than admitting that the book you were gifted wasn't up your alley. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be honest, I'm not quite sure what else you're getting at either in this post or the one yesterday. I think perhaps the reason why it didn't go down very well is the tone in which you wrote the message - you come across as someone who knows better than everyone else, even though the garbled nature of your posts and your sweeping generalisations suggest otherwise.     


I understand where you're coming from, I really do, but I simply disagree with this statement.  See,that's the exact reason I find reddit so interesting. The different opinions and the like. And by the way, I've seen someone suggest alcohol, and other than a doobie earlier today, I'm completely sober from any hard substances.

<TITLE> So...here's the thing about books (PART 2) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-07 18:36:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yesterday I made this post and it didn't get well received https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/69lwnj/soheres_the_thing_about_books

Today, I want to expand on it. The reason we like book so much is because of escapism right? People prefer fiction books almost nobody reads nonfiction nowadays  (and that's fine!) But...I gotta say, a fiction book vs a nonfiction... let's just say you're selling yourself short. And I'm not talking about those kind of books that you read once and never again. No. I'm talking Lord of the Rings, Catcher in the Rye, House of Leaves, let's see, The Hitchcock Guide to the Galaxy. What you need to do is find a book you love and just read it. It doesn't matter if it's fiction or nonfiction...just...read...the....damn....book! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is Casual unplayable without a mic now? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-07 04:57:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> One of the reasons I almost exclusively played casual was because I could just play by myself, almost no com required. But since the last update it feels just like ranked. I feel like communication now is necessary on casual and I can't just pop the game and play a few matches without feeling like I'm playing a version of ranked. 
I play on Xbox and it's so much more toxic now. People try to kick you of you don't play good. Or send you messages saying u suck because you made a mistake

<TEXT> Sometimes books are awesome, right? But what about the other half? The half we don't talk about? The half where that book you're reading doesn't make sense, or doesn't hold up to your standard. And this isn't about only books, take any piece of art, shit on it, and watch hundreds of people turn against that piece of art and also shit on it. It's a slippery slope and I'm actually quite surprised most of you don't see it for what it is: an art gallery show where the strongest survive and the weaker get swept up under the "Critical Eye Rug". </TEXT>

Yes it is

and the show doesn't even have any clear message. 

That makes matters even worse. 

Certainly not a simple one that they try to shove down the audience's throat.

I...didn't need that mental image. At all. 

Why did you make this thread when there's a discussion thread stickied? 

Becuase I felt like it? Lol. 


Is it that you saw the negative and uninformed comments, like your own,

Brb, I'm gonna go make myself a sandwich

<TEXT> Let's forget about the context of the show for a second here.  The people who made that title know exactly what they're doing, they know the average person won't watch their subpar show so they make this controversial title to get a reaction. Same goes for the movie.  It's the equivalent of a click baity title that shows that the only way to creatos could get their message across was to resort to a title worthy of buzzfeed levels of attention seeking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This show by AbC is rapidly turning into one of my favorite crime shows. It is beautifully shot, the characters are complex  (there are no good people really, you will dislike something about each character) and the acting is downright awesome. I haven't started season 3 yet, but so far season 2 is gripping, and season 1 was very good too. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why I love The Walking Dead. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-28 01:05:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Let me start by saying that I recognize the fact that the show is inconsistent. But I have to say, I've seen *a lot* of TV shows over the past 5 years. I've seen stuff that is 10 times better written than TWD. But you know what? It doesn't matter to me. The Walking Dead creates these memorable moments that I never forget, and the characters are memorable too. When the show is good, *it is good*. Sometimes the suspense is off the charts, and I love that. Let's take last night's episode for example. Now I don't care for the no so good episodes this season because last night delivered. You can also really tell that the people who work on this show really love doing so, even if the directors and writers and producers make a lot of crappy decisions. 

All in all, whenever all is said and done, I will look back and remember the good times with this. And, in my opinion, there are many. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Does anyone else believe that gaming has gotten too pricey? We always hear of annoyances about how current gen games are 60 bucks and from what I've heard, even more in countries outside the U.S., but I sort of miss the days where I bought a console and my games and didn't have to worry about anything else. Sure, there was the occasional accessory, memory card or controller, but for the most part, it was reasonably affordable. Now we have all these online passes restricting us from buying the pre-owned version of games and barricading us from recieving our full gaming experience, DLC, online memberships, game exclusive memberships such as COD Elite, etc. It's very annoying. Plus, anyone who cannot access the internet is practically screwed over with almost every title released these days. Another annoyance is how publishers are completely disregarding future generations. Much of the content in many titles will not be available for them. I highly doubt young gamers are going to be able to access the Ceberus network for Mass Effect 2 or download maps for multiplayer titles in the year 2042. Are they devs hoping their games will lose all relevance by then? Heck, the Magnavox Oddyssey will still be sought after and it will be over 65 years old by then! </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is underwhelming at times. I recommend just doing stuff that you like, ignore pointless fetch quests if you want, the game gives you plenty of freedom on how you want to approach. For ex. The Hinterlands. You can leave it and only come back for the important stuff. 

 Make sure you explore a lot though. It's worth it.  </TEXT>

I had it connected to a power strip but have since then switched it to a wall outlet. Should I play on my X1S or should I wait?

<TEXT> Scorpio will be a higher-end device than the PS4 Pro, and will feature obvious performance and graphical advantages over the Sony offering. All Microsoft-published Scorpio games will render at 4K, meaning that they will not be upsized, as is the case with virtually all PS4 Pro 4 titles today.

my guess is that Scorpio will debut at a $500 price point, if not higher. I could see Scorpio retailing for double the price of the Xbox One S, especially if it actually includes VR hardware. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was lagging pretty bad on Battlefield until I noticed that it happened after recording a clip, and since I have it set to 5 minutes and my internet is pretty slow (5 mps) could that be the source of my lag? I cancelled the upload and so far I haven't lagged. Still not sure yet though </TEXT>

<TITLE> Do the Overwatch controls feel weird to anyone else? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-25 00:22:37 </DATE>

<TEXT> Overwatch feels weird for me, like there's some input lag or something when I move the camera around. I play on a monitor and have no problems on games like Battlefield 1. I was reading some forums and it seems like other people had some issues with the controls on console, but the most recent thread I find is months old. I can play fine with some characters but some of them like Hanzo, the cowboy or the snipers are difficult to use. 

 If someone could give me their thoughts on this it would be great. Thanks and Merry Christmas </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think the writers are all that bad. Sure, they aren't perfect, but in my opinion they are very good at building up plotlines and suspension. Also the character changes and developments in this show are among the best I've ever seen. Not many other show make me emotionally invest in characters like this show does.

In one of the most recent ones there's a panel where Dwight is basically Rick's module with one half of his face burned.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me say that I only included Fargo because of the criminal aspect- people getting in deep shit. 

But everything else is entirely different. Fargo has a dark comedy aspect to it that makes it unique despite touching on some heavy issues and moments of intense drama. But the atmosphere of Quarry is entirely different, but the drama is there. 

It's very grim, more like True Detective in that aspect. Or Training Day.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you like crime shows like BB, Fargo, True Detective and or just crime drama in general you owe it to yourself to watch this show. It is set in 1972 and it follows a vietnam veteran who can't get a job and becomes a hitman. The premiere is very good and things get spicy towards the end, and the following 6 episodes are awesome although some people said it dragged a little. I didn't think it dragged, mostly because the show is much more character-driven than say, Banshee. But it still has riveting action scenes that are somewhat reminiscent of Tarantino.

But it was the last episode that really blew me away. It was 1 hour and twenty minutes, and the pace was fantastic throughout. The episode has a single shot sequence that, if this had been a Netflix or HBO show instead HBO's branch of Cinemax, it would be talked about a lot more. 

Please check it out. You won't regret it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I seriously don't understand why people make such a big deal out of this series. Yes, it is dense, and obviously I won't get everything out of it on my 1st read, but as someone who's on Dust of Dreams right now, looking back reading this series has been fun and I can't wait to do it again. Even when something complicated happens, I think Erikson gives writes in a way that you are level with the characters. 

Describing this series as a huge puzzle you have to put together turned me off at first, but after starting reading I found out the books are written in a way that you can enjoy them without breaking your head over anything, and the fact that each book so far has had huge ending that feel final and epic helps a lot ( like Memories of Ice, which the last 200 pages of so could very well be the ending of a stand alone book) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, I know I'm late, but I just wanted to chime in something about the pattern. Kadaspala inscribed some kind of code, and that helped him create the god's soul. How, I have no idea. 

But anyway when writing the code Kadaspala made so the god only had one purpose, and that was to kill. Draconus asked Ditch to be the god's eye but also in a weird way I remember him telling Ditch try to reason with the god, since the thing that Kadaspala made was crazy. So when the god gets ready to kill, Ditch convinces him that Rake is doing something honorable and something to the effect of "hey this guy is being cool, that one is the douchebag" and so the god stabs Kadaspala. 

This is just one of those wtf things of the series but honestly I loved that section. That imagery of the child god, was...macabre.  </TEXT>
