<TITLE> The master list of Photoshop shortcuts for Window and Mac </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-30 12:21:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **For Windows:**

* Open File  This is where all starts from  opening a picture. Do this by pressing Ctrl + O.
* Create document  If you have no picture to open, create a new document by pressing Ctrl + N.
* Zooming in and out  You do this by pressing the Ctrl button and the plus and minus keys. You can also press Ctrl and use the scroll click on a mouse to zoom both ways.
* Save for the web -. Alt + Ctrl + Shift + S will always take you to the Save for the web box. Keep in mind that you can press the first three keys in any order you wish  the shortcut will still work.
* Transform layer - If you wish to transform the active layer, all you have to do is press Ctrl + T.
* Edit key shortcuts - If you want to customize the keyboard shortcuts, all you have to do is press Alt + Shift + Ctrl + K.
* Preferences  Ctrl + K will always take you to the Preferences menu.
* Levels - If you edit pictures, accessing the levels box is something you do often. From now on, do it by pressing Ctrl + L.
* Curves  Ctrl + M will allow you to quickly edit the Curves.
Hue/Saturation - To edit this, press Ctrl + U.
* Color Balance  Color Balance is another thing very useful for photo manipulation. Ctrl + B is the shortcut for this.
* Desaturate  If you quickly want to desaturate, press Ctrl + Shift + U.
Image size  Another of my personal favorites is Ctrl + Alt + I.
* New Layer  Creating a new layer can simply be done by pressing Shift + Ctrl + N.
* Liquify  If you use the Liquify tools often, Shift + Ctrl + X should be your best friend.
* Invert - Inverting the colors in Photoshop on Windows can simply be done by using the Ctrl + I shortcut.
* Fit on screen  Fitting the image on your screen is simply done by pressing Ctrl + 0.
* Ruler  You might not always want the ruler on, especially if you have a small screen, therefore keeping in mind Ctrl + R could be useful.
* Show grid - You can show or hide the grid by pressing Ctrl + 
* Show guides  If you want to quickly show or hide the guides, simply press Ctrl + ;
* Locking guides  If you work with guides and want to lock them, Alt + Ctrl + ; will do the job.
* Brush size  If you want to increase or decrease the brush size, [ and ] will do the job very quickly.
* Brush hardness  If you want to modify the hardness of the brush, Shift + [ and Shift + ] will do the trick.

Different Tools (**where starred**, it means pressing Shift and the respective key will help you cycle through different tools of the same type):

* Move Tool - V
* Marquee Tool  M*
* Lasso Tool - L*
* Crop Tool - C*
* Quick Selection / Magic Wand - W*
* Patching Brushes  J*
* Eraser  E*
* Gradient Tool / Paint Bucket  G*
* Pen Tool  P*
* Type Tool - T*
* Switch Foreground / Background Colors  X
* Default Foreground / Background Colors  D
* Line / Polygon / Ellipse tools  U*
* Sponge / Dodge / Burn tools - O*
* Brush History  Y*
* Rotate View Tool  R
* Hand Tool  H

**For Mac:**

* Open File  Command + O is where you start this time.
* Create document - If there is nothing to open, Command + N will create a new document.
* Zooming in and out  Although Command + plus and minus work on Mac too, I seriously think zooming in and out with the trackpad is faster once you get used to it.
* Save for the web - Command + Option + Shift + S is the shortcut for Macs.
* Transform layer - Transforming the active layer happens when pressing Command + T.
* Edit key shortcuts - Customizing the shortcut keys can be done by pressing Option + Command + Shift + K.
* Preferences  Command + K takes you to the Preferences.
* Levels - Accessing the Levels box is similar to the Windows shortcut, Command + L.
* Curves  Command + M will allow you to quickly edit the Curves.
* Hue/Saturation - To edit this, press Command + U.
* Color Balance  To edit the Color Balance of a picture, simply pless Command + B.
* Desaturate  Desaturating can be done by pressing Command + Shift + U.
* Image size  Finding out the Image size of a picture is simple: just press Command + Option + I.
* New Layer  Create a new layer in the active document by pressing Command + Shift + N.
* Liquify Then Command + Shift + X will take you there in no time.
* Invert - Inverting the colors in Photoshop on Mac can be done by using the Command + I keyboard shortcut.
* Fit on screen  Command + 0 will fit the document on your screen.
* Ruler  Like on Windows, pressing Command + R will hide or show the ruler.
* Show grid - You can show or hide the grid by pressing Command + 
* Show guides  You can quickly show or hide the guides by pressing Command + ;
* Locking guides  If you want to lock the guides, simply use Option + Command + ;
* Brush size  Playing with the brush size is now very easy to do with [ and ].
* Brush hardness  The brush hardness can be modified from the keyboard by using { and }  which basically means Shift + [ and Shift + ].

Different Tools (**where starred**, it means pressing Shift and the respective key will help you cycle through different tools of the same type):

* Move Tool - V
* Marquee Tool  M*
* Lasso Tool - L*
* Crop Tool - C*
* Quick Selection / Magic Wand - W*

<TITLE> [Misc] Book Insights from The Next Level by Scott Eblin </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-28 09:29:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What do new executives  or those simply looking to improve in their roles  need to do in order to take things up a notch? Scott Eblins The Next Level shows us exactly what can be done not only to optimize a leaders individual performance, but also the performance of the organization as a whole.

**1. Communicate Effectively**

Eblin points out that communication should be custom-fit. Leaders, he says, produce and deal in ideas, but in order for these ideas to take flight, there must be an effective communication process in place. On an organizational level, this might mean using transparency in order to put people at ease.

With Your Boss:

When communicating with your boss, you should consider adopting this three-pronged communication approach: ask what, referring to what issue needs to be considered or addressed; then so what, to address the implications of the issue that makes it worth considering; finally, ask now what, to establish what needs to be done next, what kind of support you need from your boss, and what milestones your boss can monitor to oversee your progress.

**2. Define What to Do**

Dont focus on how the work must be done; rather, focus on the what aspect. By providing key objectives, youll show that you trust your people to get a specific priority completed through whichever means they see fit. Letting go of the tactical aspects and instead focusing on strategic, measureable outcomes is one of the secrets of reaching  and staying at  the next level.

Framing Objectives:

* What difference will the success of this objective make?
* When is our deadline?
* When pursuing this priority, what actions are off-limits?
* How do we excel beyond todays status quo?

Set guidelines, and be sure to set forth an appropriate degree of availability to check in on progress.

**3. Pick Up Accountability**

You must be able to spot the difference between being responsible (doing the work) and being accountable (closely monitoring others who are performing the work). Your goal is to achieve the latter  it allows you to focus on outcomes, set the agenda, and achieve alignment.

Let Go of Responsibility:

When an individual reaches the next level, he or she may struggle with the less-tangible aspects of the job. Suddenly, youre overseeing processes instead of being enmeshed with them. Yet, letting go of responsibilities is a crucial aspect of operating at the next level, because it will allow you to widen your focus to oversee larger issues, such as the competitive positioning of the organization.

Become Results-Driven:

Because your next-level position leaves you more accountable for outcomes, youll need to become more focused on results. To accomplish this, consider what you can do in order to oversee your teams results. Also, dont forget that youll need to refine your communication processes; dont rely on the work to speak for itself  youll need to provide updates on achievements.

**4. Look Left and Right as You Lead**

Youll need to look left and right, as Eblin puts it, to persuade and influence your peers. To execute these crucial facets of upper-level status, you must establish rapport with your peers by building trust and credibility; then, you can collaborate and show up when youre needed, too.

Look Up:

Find out what success means to your senior executives: which metrics are they set on achieving? What are the deadlines? Who do you need to please when it comes to results?

Look Down

Your capability to stay connected. Again, this means being available and transparent, as well as listening thoroughly. It also helps to express a sincere interest in your people.

**5. Develop an Outside-In View**

Once youre an executive, you should be thinking in terms of us, instead of thinking in terms of me. Better yet, you can adapt an outside-in approach by stepping back and analyzing the organization from an outsiders point-of-view, looking at your fellow executive leaders as them. This practice can help you develop a new perspective and broaden your focus.

**6. Adopt the Big-Footprint View of Your Role**

Your executive status means that people will automatically expect you to have a greater impact across the organization. Youll have increased visibility, so be sure to use your words with precision and thoroughly think before you speak; use a casual approach when addressing emotion-laden issues like compensation, downsizing, and so forth.

Focus on bringing groups together:

The message you send has the ability to be carried forth by the rest of the organization. Put down your smartphone (or any other distractions) during meetings, and instead use your energy on bringing groups together. Actively listen to feedback, and show that the concerns of your people matter to you by taking follow-up action.

**7. Achieve the Engagement Sweet Spot**

Both you and your employees must find balance on the scale of engagement. For your role - focusing on what must get done now by tackling one priority at a time. For an organization - youll want to develop a rhythm in which everyone is synced with these priorities and milestones can be tracked across all levels.

Boost Team Reliance:

You must also be able to access unfiltered feedback from your team, it allows you to see: how well youre performing at the next level, and how well your people are performing in their roles.

<TITLE> Book Insights from The Advantage: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else In Business by Patrick Lencioni </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-28 09:17:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In this book, we learn that equation with the two key requirements for the organizations success is

*a) Smart + b) Healthy.*

**Smart is:** strategy, marketing, finance and technology. These are easier to quantify and deal with and these decision sciences are taught in business schools.

**Healthy is:** minimal politics, minimal confusion, high morale, high productivity, and low turnover among good people.

Thus being smart is only **half of the equation.**

Lencioni further writes that most companies ignore the health side of the organizational equation and focus mainly on the smart side.

1) Start at the top. CEOs, executives and managers must embody the commitment to the health part of the equation in order for their teams to follow.

2) Overcome the 3 Biases:

* *The Sophistication Bias*  that organizational health isnt sophisticated or imperative enough to deal with at a managerial level.
* *The Adrenaline Bias*  that because it doesnt appear on the surface to be a firefighting activity demanding immediate attention, organizational culture doesnt need to be addressed, and
* *The Quantification Bias*  that the benefits of organizational health are too difficult to measure precisely.

3) Balance smart with health. Even after theyve admitted the need to refine organizational health, many leaders resort right back to their old behaviors

4) Build a cohesive leadership team. Lencioni states that if the organization doesnt have a team that is unified then it is not going to become healthy  there is just no way around that.There are *5 Behavioral Principles* for building a cohesive team:

* *Building Trust*  trust is absolutely critical and everyone must trust each other to be a truly cohesive team.
* *Mastering Conflict*  the team must embrace and handle conflict well. Not interpersonal conflict but conflict about issues.
* *Achieving Commitment*  commitment is achieved if conflict on issues is allowed. Otherwise people wont weigh in and wont buy in.
* *Embracing Accountability*  team members must be held accountable to accomplish goals and results.
* *Focusing on Results*  this is the ultimate goal of the prior four behaviors

5) Create clarity and achieve alignment (and Goals   Objectives). Achieving clarity is all about alignment in the company. Real alignment is rare and it cannot be achieved quickly through a one-time email or company presentation. Its a process.

6) Over-communicate clarity. The key here is not merely communicating but OVER-communicating. For it to sink in fully, it must be thoroughly expressed over an extended period of time.

7) Reinforce clarity. Besides vocalizing the answers to the questions from step five, leaders must ensure that this information is reinforced in the human processes of the company. 

8) The 4 Types of Meetings are central to sustaining organizational health. Daily check-ins, tactical staff meetings, topical meetings and quarterly off-site business review meetings are absolutely critical to sustaining organizational health. Leaders are responsible for emphasizing goals, behaviors, and communicative processes.

Lencioni sees a major shift in the mindset of executives towards delegating technical work to their team while focusing on the disciplines that create and maintain organization health.

<TITLE> Book Insights from The Next Level by Scott Eblin </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-21 07:09:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What do new executives  or those simply looking to improve in their roles  need to do in order to take things up a notch? Scott Eblins The Next Level shows us exactly what can be done not only to optimize a leaders individual performance, but also the performance of the organization as a whole.

**1. Communicate Effectively**

Eblin points out that communication should be custom-fit. Leaders, he says, produce and deal in ideas, but in order for these ideas to take flight, there must be an effective communication process in place. On an organizational level, this might mean using transparency in order to put people at ease.

With Your Boss:

When communicating with your boss, you should consider adopting this three-pronged communication approach: ask what, referring to what issue needs to be considered or addressed; then so what, to address the implications of the issue that makes it worth considering; finally, ask now what, to establish what needs to be done next, what kind of support you need from your boss, and what milestones your boss can monitor to oversee your progress.

**2. Define What to Do**

Dont focus on how the work must be done; rather, focus on the what aspect. By providing key objectives, youll show that you trust your people to get a specific priority completed through whichever means they see fit. Letting go of the tactical aspects and instead focusing on strategic, measureable outcomes is one of the secrets of reaching  and staying at  the next level.

Framing Objectives:

* What difference will the success of this objective make?
* When is our deadline?
* When pursuing this priority, what actions are off-limits?
* How do we excel beyond todays status quo?

Set guidelines, and be sure to set forth an appropriate degree of availability to check in on progress.

**3. Pick Up Accountability**

You must be able to spot the difference between being responsible (doing the work) and being accountable (closely monitoring others who are performing the work). Your goal is to achieve the latter  it allows you to focus on outcomes, set the agenda, and achieve alignment.

Let Go of Responsibility:

When an individual reaches the next level, he or she may struggle with the less-tangible aspects of the job. Suddenly, youre overseeing processes instead of being enmeshed with them. Yet, letting go of responsibilities is a crucial aspect of operating at the next level, because it will allow you to widen your focus to oversee larger issues, such as the competitive positioning of the organization.

Become Results-Driven:

Because your next-level position leaves you more accountable for outcomes, youll need to become more focused on results. To accomplish this, consider what you can do in order to oversee your teams results. Also, dont forget that youll need to refine your communication processes; dont rely on the work to speak for itself  youll need to provide updates on achievements.

**4. Look Left and Right as You Lead**

Youll need to look left and right, as Eblin puts it, to persuade and influence your peers. To execute these crucial facets of upper-level status, you must establish rapport with your peers by building trust and credibility; then, you can collaborate and show up when youre needed, too.

Look Up:

Find out what success means to your senior executives: which metrics are they set on achieving? What are the deadlines? Who do you need to please when it comes to results?

Look Down

Your capability to stay connected. Again, this means being available and transparent, as well as listening thoroughly. It also helps to express a sincere interest in your people.

**5. Develop an Outside-In View**

Once youre an executive, you should be thinking in terms of us, instead of thinking in terms of me. Better yet, you can adapt an outside-in approach by stepping back and analyzing the organization from an outsiders point-of-view, looking at your fellow executive leaders as them. This practice can help you develop a new perspective and broaden your focus.

**6. Adopt the Big-Footprint View of Your Role**

Your executive status means that people will automatically expect you to have a greater impact across the organization. Youll have increased visibility, so be sure to use your words with precision and thoroughly think before you speak; use a casual approach when addressing emotion-laden issues like compensation, downsizing, and so forth.

Focus on bringing groups together:

The message you send has the ability to be carried forth by the rest of the organization. Put down your smartphone (or any other distractions) during meetings, and instead use your energy on bringing groups together. Actively listen to feedback, and show that the concerns of your people matter to you by taking follow-up action.

**7. Achieve the Engagement Sweet Spot**

Both you and your employees must find balance on the scale of engagement. For your role - focusing on what must get done now by tackling one priority at a time. For an organization - youll want to develop a rhythm in which everyone is synced with these priorities and milestones can be tracked across all levels.

Boost Team Reliance:

You must also be able to access unfiltered feedback from your team, it allows you to see: how well youre performing at the next level, and how well your people are performing in their roles.

<TITLE> [Misc] Book Insights from "Zero to One" by Peter Thiel and Blake Masters - a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-21 06:58:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **The Past Doesnt Equal the Future**

Thiel believes that the future will be shaped by individuals who take a different stance on things  they possess self-created knowledge that isnt taught in universities, but is commonly held by a few individuals. He asks: **What important truth do very few people agree with you on?**

Moreover, Thiel explores the concept of innovation. Most people believe that it entails globalization, or horizontal extensive progress, he says. Thiel illustrates this concept with a horizontal line graph and the equation 1 to n. He argues that true innovation actually lies in vertical intensive progress, represented by 0 to 1. Startups, he says, are the key to unlocking vertical intensive progress, because **a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future.**

In other words, and most importantly, Thiel strongly believes that the past doesnt equal the future.

**Learn the NEW Startup Dogmas**

In the 1990s, tech startups lived by the following four principles:

* Advance in increments
* Dont have a precise plan; be flexible and lean instead
* Improve on the competition
* Focus on your product, not your sales

Following the dotcom crash, however, entrepreneurs applied a new set of doctrines, which were entire opposites of the former ones:

* It is better to be bold and risky than to choose triviality
* Any plan  even a bad one  is better than none at all
* Competitive markets hinder profits
* Sales are every bit as important as products

**Be Creative, not Competitive**

Thiel believes competition should not be your focal point. In fact, he advocates avoiding competition, saying, **If you want to create and capture lasting value, dont build an undifferentiated business.** Instead of overcoming your competition, youre better off focusing your efforts on leading in a smaller market.

**Construct a Monopoly**

Building on the concept of dominating a niche market, Thiel suggests starting small, and then scaling accordingly. To become a monopoly, companies must have the following characteristics:

* Proprietary Technology
* Network Effects
* Scalability
* Branding

Beyond these four main characteristics, Thiel recommends two approaches for building a monopoly:
* Lead in a Specific Niche, then Expand (Amazon)
* Avoid Disruption (Napster)

Forget Luck; Make Success Your Intention

Most CEOs and entrepreneurs already know that success requires hard work and is rarely, if ever, accredited to luck. Thiel backs this claim. To make success your intention, Thiel says you must:

* Determine what you want AND why you want it.
* Come up with a long-term, actionable plan.
* Take strategic action using that plan.

**Build Your Startup using these Fundamentals**

* Drive Focus on One Big Thing
* Define Ownership, Possession, and Control
* Learn How to Sell It

**Ask Yourself these 7 Questions**

* Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?
* Is now the right time to start your particular business?
* Are you starting with a big share of a small market?
* Do you have the right team?
* Do you have a way to not just create, but deliver, your product?
* Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?
* Have you identified a unique opportunity that others dont see?

Youll have increased visibility, so be sure to use your words with precision and thoroughly think before you speak; use a casual approach when addressing emotion-laden issues like compensation, downsizing, and so forth.

Focus on bringing groups together:

The message you send has the ability to be carried forth by the rest of the organization. Put down your smartphone (or any other distractions) during meetings, and instead use your energy on bringing groups together. Actively listen to feedback, and show that the concerns of your people matter to you by taking follow-up action.

**7. Achieve the Engagement Sweet Spot**

Both you and your employees must find balance on the scale of engagement. For your role - focusing on what must get done now by tackling one priority at a time. For an organization - youll want to develop a rhythm in which everyone is synced with these priorities and milestones can be tracked across all levels.

Boost Team Reliance:

You must also be able to access unfiltered feedback from your team, it allows you to see: how well youre performing at the next level, and how well your people are performing in their roles.

<TITLE> Book Insights from The Advantage: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else In Business by Patrick Lencioni </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-15 12:48:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In this book, we learn that equation with the two key requirements for the organizations success is

*a) Smart + b) Healthy.*

**Smart is:** strategy, marketing, finance and technology. These are easier to quantify and deal with and these decision sciences are taught in business schools.

**Healthy is:** minimal politics, minimal confusion, high morale, high productivity, and low turnover among good people.

Thus being smart is only **half of the equation.**

Lencioni further writes that most companies ignore the health side of the organizational equation and focus mainly on the smart side.

1) Start at the top. CEOs, executives and managers must embody the commitment to the health part of the equation in order for their teams to follow.

2) Overcome the 3 Biases:

* *The Sophistication Bias*  that organizational health isnt sophisticated or imperative enough to deal with at a managerial level.
* *The Adrenaline Bias*  that because it doesnt appear on the surface to be a firefighting activity demanding immediate attention, organizational culture doesnt need to be addressed, and
* *The Quantification Bias*  that the benefits of organizational health are too difficult to measure precisely.

3) Balance smart with health. Even after theyve admitted the need to refine organizational health, many leaders resort right back to their old behaviors

4) Build a cohesive leadership team. Lencioni states that if the organization doesnt have a team that is unified then it is not going to become healthy  there is just no way around that.There are *5 Behavioral Principles* for building a cohesive team:

* *Building Trust*  trust is absolutely critical and everyone must trust each other to be a truly cohesive team.
* *Mastering Conflict*  the team must embrace and handle conflict well. Not interpersonal conflict but conflict about issues.
* *Achieving Commitment*  commitment is achieved if conflict on issues is allowed. Otherwise people wont weigh in and wont buy in.
* *Embracing Accountability*  team members must be held accountable to accomplish goals and results.
* *Focusing on Results*  this is the ultimate goal of the prior four behaviors

5) Create clarity and achieve alignment (and Goals   Objectives). Achieving clarity is all about alignment in the company. Real alignment is rare and it cannot be achieved quickly through a one-time email or company presentation. Its a process.

6) Over-communicate clarity. The key here is not merely communicating but OVER-communicating. For it to sink in fully, it must be thoroughly expressed over an extended period of time.

7) Reinforce clarity. Besides vocalizing the answers to the questions from step five, leaders must ensure that this information is reinforced in the human processes of the company. 

8) The 4 Types of Meetings are central to sustaining organizational health. Daily check-ins, tactical staff meetings, topical meetings and quarterly off-site business review meetings are absolutely critical to sustaining organizational health. Leaders are responsible for emphasizing goals, behaviors, and communicative processes.

Lencioni sees a major shift in the mindset of executives towards delegating technical work to their team while focusing on the disciplines that create and maintain organization health.

<TITLE> [Misc] Book Insights from "High Output Management" by Andrew S. Grove </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-10 07:00:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Master the Basics of Production**

In order to have an effective production system, Grove says that all execs and managers must consider the following three components:

* Time
* Quality
* Cost

The way in which you handle these components will determine how effective your production processes are. Production takes place in three stages:

* Process
* Assembly
* Test

You may also have whats known as a limiting step; or, the process that requires the most amount of time to complete, and therefore deserves the most attention.

While these are basics with which many managers and execs are already very familiar, Groves crash-course on production is especially beneficial for new entrepreneurs.

**Identify Your Indicators**

Grove says that in order to achieve sustainable scalability, youll need to establish some indicators. The best types of indicators measure the actual output  not just the activity itself. They should be measurable, and ideally, they should be accompanied by a metric indicating a timeframe and a quantity. These concepts go hand-in-hand with OKRs, which is the most effective way to integrate indicators in your company.

Grove identifies two main types of indicators:

* Leading Indicators: These should measure and/or evaluate input and predict output
* Trend Indicators: These should measure output within a given period of time, such as a quarter or month

**Implement Managerial Leverage**

Grove defines a managers output as the output of his or her organization combined with the output of neighboring organizations, or other organizations under his or her influence. The managerial leverage, then, is defined as the measure of output created by any of the managers activity. Effective managers have a greater influence on neighboring organizations.

According to Grove, these are the primary responsibilities of a manager:

* Information Gathering
* Information Giving
* Decision Making
* Nudging

Managers can also delegate, but that requires both managers and their direct reports to have access to the same information.

Grove recommends that supervisory managers have 6-8 subordinates. Having fewer subordinates could lead to meddling, while having more creates chaos and confusion.

In addition to the points listed above, Grove believes that managers should do their best to achieve regularity, and avoid interruptions whenever possible. Batch processing is an effective way to complete tasks, and managers must also designate specific me time to complete their duties.

**Get the Most out of your Meetings**

Grove considers meetings to be a high-leverage medium, but only when they are used effectively. He identifies two main types of meetings:

* Process-Oriented Meetings These meetings should consist of an exchange of information, and they should always be scheduled. Grove advocates holding weekly one-on-one meetings between managers and direct reports. Staff meetings should only be held to discuss any matters involving more than two people, all of whom should be present. Operational meetings should open with presentations, and they should be used to review achievements and ongoing processes.
* Mission-Oriented Meetings These meetings can be ad-hoc, but they must be driven by an output, and they require a chairman.

**Become a Strategic Decision-Maker**

When managers and execs make decisions, they typically happen in three stages:

* Free Discussion All parties involved in the decision making process should be able to partake in the discussion as equals. Grove says that one of the greatest challenges that prevents good decision making is the fact that many people are hesitant to speak freely, thereby shielding some of the critical information that could be used to inform important decisions.
* Clear Decision A decision is made based on the free discussion.
* Full Support

While support wont always entail complete agreement by all parties, it should always involve commitment by everyone involved. Grove believes that when making decisions, you should always consult others first.

**Plan Wisely**

In High Output Management, planning is considered to be a three-step process that involves:

* Studying Your Environment
* Predicting the Future
* Reconciling

Grove recommends using MBO to assess your performance, but to take it a step further and optimize efficiency, his OKRs are a suitable practice to aid in planning.

Effective planning is critical to performance. Grove believes that failure to execute is a result of failed planning of the past. Also, he advises that managers and execs bear in mind that their resources are finite. When you approve one project, you are ultimately saying no to something else.

**Determine Your Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)**

Grove believes that there is no single, optimal style of management. Instead, he argues that your output is a result of a few different variables. These variables make up your Task-Relevant Maturity. It incorporates the following:

* Your Degree of Achievement-Orientation
* Your Readiness to Responsibility
* Training
* Experience

When managers have a high TRM, they are more likely to delegate. As a result, this increases their managerial leverage. They generally have minimal involvement in their direct reports operations, but they establish regular monitoring practices. Individuals with medium TRM tend to have individual-oriented session, and establish consistent, closed-loop communication. Low TRM managers usually rely on task-specific session, and are very specific in their expectations of what, when, and how.

**Tackle Performance Management with this Two-Pronged Approach**

Reviewing performance is the single most important form of task-relevant feedback, according to Grove. Your objective in assessing an employees performance should be to improve his or performance by advancing skills and boosting motivation. This can be achieved in two ways: assessment and delivery.

* Assessment: You can only assess an individuals performance if you provide clarity in your expectations ahead of time. You must specifically define output measures, including productions, reports, designs, and so forth; and you must also establish internal measures, such as hiring, planning, etc. Bear in mind that you must never evaluate people against what you perceive as their potential; rather, you must evaluate them based on their output. Again, Groves OKRs are advantageous in achieving clarity and defining expectations in advance.
* Delivery: When it comes to ensuring delivery, you should aim to achieve commitment from your people. Level with them by focusing on the individual  always listen first, and then try to establish a solution.

**Train Effectively and Compensate Fairly**

Grove believes that motivating and training employees should be the sole responsibility of the boss. Training should always fit with your company culture and processes, and more importantly, training should be approached as an ongoing, evolving process  not simply a one-time event.

Employee compensation can be based on two factors: merit and experience. Many organizations use a blend of the two to determine salary. When an employee receives a promotion, it should always be tied to his or her performance.

<TITLE> Book Insights from "Zero to One" by Peter Thiel and Blake Masters </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-10 06:27:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **The Past Doesnt Equal the Future**

Thiel believes that the future will be shaped by individuals who take a different stance on things  they possess self-created knowledge that isnt taught in universities, but is commonly held by a few individuals. He asks: **What important truth do very few people agree with you on?**

Moreover, Thiel explores the concept of innovation. Most people believe that it entails globalization, or horizontal extensive progress, he says. Thiel illustrates this concept with a horizontal line graph and the equation 1 to n. He argues that true innovation actually lies in vertical intensive progress, represented by 0 to 1. Startups, he says, are the key to unlocking vertical intensive progress, because **a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future.**

In other words, and most importantly, Thiel strongly believes that the past doesnt equal the future.

**Learn the NEW Startup Dogmas**

In the 1990s, tech startups lived by the following four principles:

* Advance in increments
* Dont have a precise plan; be flexible and lean instead
* Improve on the competition
* Focus on your product, not your sales

Following the dotcom crash, however, entrepreneurs applied a new set of doctrines, which were entire opposites of the former ones:

* It is better to be bold and risky than to choose triviality
* Any plan  even a bad one  is better than none at all
* Competitive markets hinder profits
* Sales are every bit as important as products

**Be Creative, not Competitive**

Thiel believes competition should not be your focal point. In fact, he advocates avoiding competition, saying, **If you want to create and capture lasting value, dont build an undifferentiated business.** Instead of overcoming your competition, youre better off focusing your efforts on leading in a smaller market.

**Construct a Monopoly**

Building on the concept of dominating a niche market, Thiel suggests starting small, and then scaling accordingly. To become a monopoly, companies must have the following characteristics:

* Proprietary Technology
* Network Effects
* Scalability
* Branding

Beyond these four main characteristics, Thiel recommends two approaches for building a monopoly:
* Lead in a Specific Niche, then Expand (Amazon)
* Avoid Disruption (Napster)

Forget Luck; Make Success Your Intention

Most CEOs and entrepreneurs already know that success requires hard work and is rarely, if ever, accredited to luck. Thiel backs this claim. To make success your intention, Thiel says you must:

* Determine what you want AND why you want it.
* Come up with a long-term, actionable plan.
* Take strategic action using that plan.

**Build Your Startup using these Fundamentals**

* Drive Focus on One Big Thing
* Define Ownership, Possession, and Control
* Learn How to Sell It

**Ask Yourself these 7 Questions**

* Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?
* Is now the right time to start your particular business?
* Are you starting with a big share of a small market?
* Do you have the right team?
* Do you have a way to not just create, but deliver, your product?
* Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?
* Have you identified a unique opportunity that others dont see?

<TITLE> Book Insights from "Built to Last - Successful Habits of Visionary Companies" by James Collins and Jerry Porras </TITLE>

<TEXT> What are the behaviors that make companies last decades  even past the century mark  and achieve continued success? James Collins and Jerry Porras peer behind the scenes of such organizations, which theyve dubbed visionary companies, in their compilation Built to Last. These companies are visionary, indeed: they have an average founding date of 1897 and experienced stock-return performance 15 times greater than the general market since 1926. Here are the things that have made them so successful, and what you can do to build your organization to last:

**Take an Architectural Approach**

Developing an organization built upon strong systems and values is the first step of building a company made to last. Identify your values and the systems youll use to reflect them, prior to even developing your product.

*Hewlett-Packard and Sony: Great Companies First, Innovative Products Later*

HP and Sony developed some products that, by todays standards, seem lackluster: urinal flushers and heating pads, respectively, were among the companies earliest products. Yet, these companies continue to thrive today not because of their earliest products, but because they took an architectural approach, focusing on values and systems first.

*The Myth of Charismatic Leaders*

Some built-to-last companies had visionary leaders, but not all. What is crucial, however, is having leaders that facilitate the development of their people and processes. Some of the most successful leaders, such Motorola founder Paul Galvin, encourage dissent, discussion, and disagreement to prompt their people to make meaningful contributions. This allowed Motorola to outperform Zenith, a company that had a visionary leader but lost a great deal of its success after he passed.

**Ideals Drive Visionary Organizations**

*Mercks Giveaway*

At its core, your organization must have ideologies in place that go beyond the purpose of being lucrative. Merck, for one, embodied their core ideology of being genuinely inspired by the ideals of advancement of medical science, and of service to humanity when they gave a drug, Mectizan, away for free to millions of people who needed it after no one bought it. Pfizer leaders, on the other hand, have explicitly stated that the companys goal is to get profit out of everything they do.

*Core Ideologies*

To establish your own core ideology, ask yourself this: who are we, what do we stand for, and what are we all about? These are your shaping forces upon which your company can be built. Even when your organization is more ideologically-driven than profit-driven, it actually pays off more in terms of profitability. J. Willard Marriott, Sr., for example, said that he didnt set out to build an empire; rather, his goal was to provide friendly service and good food at a fair price, and work hard to make a profit  in that very order.

*Values vs. Purposes*

Your organizations core values are its guiding principles; they cannot be compromised for financial gains. Usually, they can be summed up in a simple statement. Purposes, on the other hand, identify your reason for existing. They should be broad and enduring, such as Johnson   Johnsons purpose to alleviate pain and suffering, or Disneys: to use our imaginations to bring happiness to millions. To identify your purpose, simply ask of your organization: what is our reason for being?

*Preserve the Core; Stimulate Progress*

You can change your strategy, tactics, operations, products, and culture over time, but core ideology should never waver. Do not wait for a sign that its time to change; instead, practice self-criticism regularly. Wal-Mart, for example, continually seeks to exceed customer expectations.

**Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals**

*Boeings Challenge*

To outlast your competitors, your organization must pursue big, hairy, audacious goals (BHAGs), such as Boeings commitment to build a jet for commercial use, which resulted in the 707. It met a similar challenge in developing the 727 by meeting stringent specifications outlined by Eastern Airlines. Through each feat, Boeing managed to conquer the BHAGs while maintaining their core values: to be on the leading edge of aviation.

*Set BHAGs that are Clear   Compelling*

BHAGS should require little or no explanation, should go beyond an organizations comfort zone, should provoke excitement, and align with core ideology. They can even be somewhat risky, and go beyond the life of the current leader.

**Great Places to Work  For Some**

If your organization is built to last using a very specific architectural approach, then its impossible that not every potential hire will fit in there  and thats okay.

*Cult-like Cultures*

Having a culture thats almost cult-like allows a company to promote values while still letting employees feel a sense of belonging. Nordsrom, for example, has a longstanding history of Nordies who deliver superb service and belong to the company, which even has chants of affirmation. To build a balanced and healthy culture of cultism, you should promote from within, offer workplace socializing opportunities, have training programs geared towards your ideologies, and continue to emphasize heritage and organizational values.

*Home-Grown Management*

Of all the 18 visionary companies, there are only four instances in which they went outside the organization for a CEO. By planning for succession, you can promote from within and still stimulate growth and change. GE, for example, makes a habit of promoting and developing carefully selected talent from within.

**Pounce on Opportunities**

*Lucrative Accidents*

Visionary companies dont just learn from their mistakes  they can actually capitalize on them. Johnson   Johnson developed antiseptic gauze that caused irritation. In response, they developed a can of talc to soothe skin, which eventually became one of its best-selling products: baby powder.

*Evolution*

Accidental progress leads to evolution. Innovative steps taken  no matter how small  can turn into lucrative opportunities. Be sure to experiment and allow room for the strongest results to thrive.

*Variation*

Most visionary companies practice some form of this motto: try something, and if it works, keep it. If it doesnt, change something. Wal-Mart greeters, for example, were actually designed to prevent shoplifting. The experiment worked successfully, which is why youll find greeters in locations nationwide.

*Success of 3M*

Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M) originally set out to be a mining company. It soon failed, but eventually wound up developing Scotch tape, thanks, in part, to the fact that each day they use 15% and 30% rules: 15% of the time, technical people can spend time on their own projects, and 30% of each divisions revenue is expected to come from products and services introduced within the past four years.

**Never Rest**

Visionary organizations dont simply assess how theyre doing now; they plan to do better for the future.

*Continuous Improvement*

To stay ahead of the game, companies such as Merck, HP, and Motorola simulate discontent. For example, Boeing uses an eyes of the enemy approach to prompt managers to develop strategies as if they were competitors. Both Nordstrom and HP rank sellers performances based on peers sales.

**Beyond Vision Statements: Ford**

The essence of an organization is the translation of ideology and drive for progress into its fabric. This essence can come to life through goals, pay systems, and cultural practices.

*Alignment*

Ford needed to revamp itself in the 1980s, so it came out with its Mission, Values, and Guiding Principles (MVGP), which emphasized people before products and profits. This aligned the organization to emphasize the fact that people are a companys best asset by developing employee involvement and customer satisfaction.

*Ideology and Aims into Reality*

Dont just create a document such as Fords MVGP  you must also act upon these findings. Ford created employee-involvement programs and participative-management programs to embody their MVGP.

*World-Class BHAGs*

Ford used Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals to develop an entirely new, world-class car. It resulted in the top-selling car in the nation, the Taurus. To follow through with your own BHAGs, make sure that all company practices, programs, communications can be harmonized and mesh with your core ideologies and goals.

**Six Steps to Visionary Alignment**

To achieve alignment on a visionary level, you must:

1. Outline the whole picture by making sure that all of your elements work together.

2. Sweat the small stuff  worry about little details if you consider them important and they make a lasting impression.

3. Cluster, dont shotgun by using processes that reinforce one another.

4. Swim in your own current by asking whether your processes and practices work for your organization  dont concern yourself with what others are doing.

5. Obliterate misalignment. If something is out of synch with your core ideology, then change it.

6. Abide by the universal requirements  your core ideology and drive for progress are fundamental, and as long as you have an organization that preserves your core and stimulates progress, then its built to last.

<TITLE> Book Insights from Work Rules!: Insights from inside Google by Laszlo Bock. Most pertain to Googles People Operations, modern equivalent of HR </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-28 15:28:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Improve Performance with OKR Goals**

One way to drive performance is by emphasizing personal growth. One of the reasons Google uses OKR Goals  and why **theyre so powerful  is because they simultaneously drive personal growth by encouraging employees to meet their own individual objectives while contributing to company goals,** since all priorities are aligned.

OKRs consist of Objectives and Key Results. Some Objectives should be aspirational, while others can be operational. Key Results are used to determine what needs to be done to accomplish the Objectives, and should be measurable.

Google still uses OKRs to this day. Not only are they effective for accomplishing goals, but research demonstrates that you can improve employee performance when you invite individuals to be committed to their goals. Likewise, youll improve employee engagement when you collaborate with your people to set ambitious, specific goals. Treat Your People like theyre Irreplaceable

Bock said that prior to his experience at Google, he was frustrated with the fact that **leaders always spoke of putting people first, and then treated them like replaceable gears.** Google, however, has an incredibly stringent hiring process. Google recruiters use sample work tests to see their candidates in action, and they tend to hire individuals with ambition and curiosity over experience.

If you take the time to hire the right people, they really will become irreplaceable. And thats a benefit for both you and your hires: when you find the right fit, Bock says, people require less training, and on top of that, employees will be put in a position where they can really use and build upon their strengths.

**Learn to Give Feedback Separately from Consequences**

Your aim in providing ongoing employee feedback should be to drive performance. When someone is performing below your expectations, the feedback you provide shouldnt be about repercussions, it should be focused on giving that employee everything he needs to succeed (resources, information, and clear expectations, etc.). Compensation and promotions are separate entities, and are therefore are not main components of your ongoing, continuous loop of feedback.

**Use Actions to Support Your Mission**

Every company should have a mission, but more importantly, Bock believes that **each companys mission should be specific and driven by actions and activities.** If your mission is too vague, or if you never drive your mission through tangible actions, its likely that it wont resonate with your employees.

**Dont Weigh Your Company Down with Rules**

Bock recommends trusting your employees to do the right thing without setting forth too many strict guidelines. He believes that **when too many rules are enforced, creativity and motivation are diminished,** thereby thwarting productivity.

**Never Start Out with Negative Assumptions**

**Managers and execs who start out with the belief that their people are inherently good will fare better than others,** according to Bock. If you start out with the assumption that your employees are out to rip you off, you risk developing a rule-driven, negative environment in which employees do only whats required of them from the get go. Bock believes that this sort of optimism is what sets great organizations apart from others, because its there that people can truly excel, thrive, and do their best work.

**Excel by using Small Experiments**

Google takes an interesting approach in trying out new systems and tools: they try them out, as would a scientific researcher, on different groups of people before implementing them fully. Always fond of data, Google execs will study the performance quality and morale of the test groups to see how well the new tool or system is working. You, too, can **collect insights from your employees after you try new things** by retrieving data through your weekly progress reports.

**Build Trust and Commitment through Transparency**

Bock advocates always keeping your employees in the loop about whats going on inside the company. This, he says, fosters commitment, because it encourages employees to think that theyre all in it together. The emphasis in your company should be on unity, not on division. As such, you need to remain open and transparent on all levels. Without that transparency, you wont be able to build trust, and your people will be less likely to commit fully to your company.

**Take Advantage of Mistakes**

Google encourages its employees to take sensible risks, and as such, they acknowledge that failure is sometimes inevitable. But as Bock notes, failures can breed intelligence  people tend to learn more after mistakes than they do when things go smoothly. Failures can actually be successes, because they ultimately foster growth and development. Yet, in order to achieve that growth and development, you must let your people know that its okay to make mistakes.

<TITLE> Book Insights from "Built to Last - Successful Habits of Visionary Companies" by James Collins and Jerry Porras </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-28 15:16:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What are the behaviors that make companies last decades  even past the century mark  and achieve continued success? James Collins and Jerry Porras peer behind the scenes of such organizations, which theyve dubbed visionary companies, in their compilation Built to Last. These companies are visionary, indeed: they have an average founding date of 1897 and experienced stock-return performance 15 times greater than the general market since 1926. Here are the things that have made them so successful, and what you can do to build your organization to last:

**Take an Architectural Approach**

Developing an organization built upon strong systems and values is the first step of building a company made to last. Identify your values and the systems youll use to reflect them, prior to even developing your product.

*Hewlett-Packard and Sony: Great Companies First, Innovative Products Later*

HP and Sony developed some products that, by todays standards, seem lackluster: urinal flushers and heating pads, respectively, were among the companies earliest products. Yet, these companies continue to thrive today not because of their earliest products, but because they took an architectural approach, focusing on values and systems first.

*The Myth of Charismatic Leaders*

Some built-to-last companies had visionary leaders, but not all. What is crucial, however, is having leaders that facilitate the development of their people and processes. Some of the most successful leaders, such Motorola founder Paul Galvin, encourage dissent, discussion, and disagreement to prompt their people to make meaningful contributions. This allowed Motorola to outperform Zenith, a company that had a visionary leader but lost a great deal of its success after he passed.

**Ideals Drive Visionary Organizations**

*Mercks Giveaway*

At its core, your organization must have ideologies in place that go beyond the purpose of being lucrative. Merck, for one, embodied their core ideology of being genuinely inspired by the ideals of advancement of medical science, and of service to humanity when they gave a drug, Mectizan, away for free to millions of people who needed it after no one bought it. Pfizer leaders, on the other hand, have explicitly stated that the companys goal is to get profit out of everything they do.

*Core Ideologies*

To establish your own core ideology, ask yourself this: who are we, what do we stand for, and what are we all about? These are your shaping forces upon which your company can be built. Even when your organization is more ideologically-driven than profit-driven, it actually pays off more in terms of profitability. J. Willard Marriott, Sr., for example, said that he didnt set out to build an empire; rather, his goal was to provide friendly service and good food at a fair price, and work hard to make a profit  in that very order.

*Values vs. Purposes*

Your organizations core values are its guiding principles; they cannot be compromised for financial gains. Usually, they can be summed up in a simple statement. Purposes, on the other hand, identify your reason for existing. They should be broad and enduring, such as Johnson   Johnsons purpose to alleviate pain and suffering, or Disneys: to use our imaginations to bring happiness to millions. To identify your purpose, simply ask of your organization: what is our reason for being?

*Preserve the Core; Stimulate Progress*

You can change your strategy, tactics, operations, products, and culture over time, but core ideology should never waver. Do not wait for a sign that its time to change; instead, practice self-criticism regularly. Wal-Mart, for example, continually seeks to exceed customer expectations.

**Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals**

*Boeings Challenge*

To outlast your competitors, your organization must pursue big, hairy, audacious goals (BHAGs), such as Boeings commitment to build a jet for commercial use, which resulted in the 707. It met a similar challenge in developing the 727 by meeting stringent specifications outlined by Eastern Airlines. Through each feat, Boeing managed to conquer the BHAGs while maintaining their core values: to be on the leading edge of aviation.

*Set BHAGs that are Clear   Compelling*

BHAGS should require little or no explanation, should go beyond an organizations comfort zone, should provoke excitement, and align with core ideology. They can even be somewhat risky, and go beyond the life of the current leader.

**Great Places to Work  For Some**

If your organization is built to last using a very specific architectural approach, then its impossible that not every potential hire will fit in there  and thats okay.

*Cult-like Cultures*

Having a culture thats almost cult-like allows a company to promote values while still letting employees feel a sense of belonging. Nordsrom, for example, has a longstanding history of Nordies who deliver superb service and belong to the company, which even has chants of affirmation. To build a balanced and healthy culture of cultism, you should promote from within, offer workplace socializing opportunities, have training programs geared towards your ideologies, and continue to emphasize heritage and organizational values.

*Home-Grown Management*

Of all the 18 visionary companies, there are only four instances in which they went outside the organization for a CEO. By planning for succession, you can promote from within and still stimulate growth and change. GE, for example, makes a habit of promoting and developing carefully selected talent from within.

**Pounce on Opportunities**

*Lucrative Accidents*

Visionary companies dont just learn from their mistakes  they can actually capitalize on them. Johnson   Johnson developed antiseptic gauze that caused irritation. In response, they developed a can of talc to soothe skin, which eventually became one of its best-selling products: baby powder.

*Evolution*

Accidental progress leads to evolution. Innovative steps taken  no matter how small  can turn into lucrative opportunities. Be sure to experiment and allow room for the strongest results to thrive.

*Variation*

Most visionary companies practice some form of this motto: try something, and if it works, keep it. If it doesnt, change something. Wal-Mart greeters, for example, were actually designed to prevent shoplifting. The experiment worked successfully, which is why youll find greeters in locations nationwide.

*Success of 3M*

Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M) originally set out to be a mining company. It soon failed, but eventually wound up developing Scotch tape, thanks, in part, to the fact that each day they use 15% and 30% rules: 15% of the time, technical people can spend time on their own projects, and 30% of each divisions revenue is expected to come from products and services introduced within the past four years.

**Never Rest**

Visionary organizations dont simply assess how theyre doing now; they plan to do better for the future.

*Continuous Improvement*

To stay ahead of the game, companies such as Merck, HP, and Motorola simulate discontent. For example, Boeing uses an eyes of the enemy approach to prompt managers to develop strategies as if they were competitors. Both Nordstrom and HP rank sellers performances based on peers sales.

**Beyond Vision Statements: Ford**

The essence of an organization is the translation of ideology and drive for progress into its fabric. This essence can come to life through goals, pay systems, and cultural practices.

*Alignment*

Ford needed to revamp itself in the 1980s, so it came out with its Mission, Values, and Guiding Principles (MVGP), which emphasized people before products and profits. This aligned the organization to emphasize the fact that people are a companys best asset by developing employee involvement and customer satisfaction.

*Ideology and Aims into Reality*

Dont just create a document such as Fords MVGP  you must also act upon these findings. Ford created employee-involvement programs and participative-management programs to embody their MVGP.

*World-Class BHAGs*

Ford used Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals to develop an entirely new, world-class car. It resulted in the top-selling car in the nation, the Taurus. To follow through with your own BHAGs, make sure that all company practices, programs, communications can be harmonized and mesh with your core ideologies and goals.

**Six Steps to Visionary Alignment**

To achieve alignment on a visionary level, you must:

1. Outline the whole picture by making sure that all of your elements work together.

2. Sweat the small stuff  worry about little details if you consider them important and they make a lasting impression.

3. Cluster, dont shotgun by using processes that reinforce one another.

4. Swim in your own current by asking whether your processes and practices work for your organization  dont concern yourself with what others are doing.

5. Obliterate misalignment. If something is out of synch with your core ideology, then change it.

6. Abide by the universal requirements  your core ideology and drive for progress are fundamental, and as long as you have an organization that preserves your core and stimulates progress, then its built to last.

<TITLE> The Way Were Working Isnt Working: The Four Forgotten Needs that Energize Great Performance by Tony Schwartz - Book Insights </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-28 14:12:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Employees Need More Than Money**

Judging by the recent statistics, managers arent doing enough to keep employees engaged[/glossary] at work. Research has shown that employees are not satisfied with financial compensation alone, and that they must be connected to a greater purpose at work. In order to feel engaged at work (i.e., committed to the organization and willing to contribute discretionary efforts), presenting employees with the time for money exchange wont suffice.More importantly, employee engagement isnt just about making your associates feel good  its a critical component that has a direct impact on nearly every business result. Thus, in order to drive performance and results, you must find another source of motivation outside of compensation alone.

**Acknowledge the 4 Energy Types to Motivate Employees**

Schwartz believes that keeping employees energized is the secret for driving high performance. He feels that this is the responsibility of the executive, and he identifies four main energy sources that must be fostered: sustainability (physical), significance (spiritual), self-expression (mental), and security (emotional).

**Stop Draining Your Peoples Energy**

Typically, executives and managers are hard-wired to think that the more they can get out of their people, the more success their business will have. This is a flawed way of thinking, however. Instead of draining their associates energy levels, managers and executives should be seeking ways to strategically fuel their energy. Taking this unique approach to management will allow associates to experience a sense of empowerment and inspiration so that they can continually dedicate their best efforts to the organization.

Physical/Sustainability Energy

While mental burnout is a common symptom of the overworked employee, physical exhaustion is a common (but critical) workplace issue as well. To prevent your employees from becoming physically drained, you should employ the use of frequent breaks. This will allow them to maintain high energy levels, and it will actually make them more productive overall. While it may seem counterproductive to allow more frequent breaks, most employees cant sustain high performance for hours and hours of uninterrupted work. In fact, Schwartz cites the 90 minute rule, a principle that claims employees have a 90-minute cycle during which they go from having a high level of alertness to a low level of alertness. Thus, by implementing frequent breaks, youll actually boost productivity.One way to determine whether your employees physical energy is drained is to simply ask them. You can implement these types of questions in your weekly pulse report or during your one-on-one meetings:

* How long do you work for without taking a break?
* By the time you leave work, how tired are you?
* How easy/difficult is it for you to achieve a work/life balance?

You can even get creative with your breaks; they dont all have to consist of watercooler chats. If it suits your company culture, encourage employees to mediate, listen to music, or even get a few minutes of exercise.

**Emotional/Security Energy**

In order for employees to perform their best, they must feel valued. This encourages development and keeps employees in the performance zone. Because all humans maintain a fight or flight mentality, employees will become detached if they sense that theyre no longer valued at work. What theyre seeking is security, or a leader who empowers his people by showing them that theyre appreciated.Schwartz also recommends that all parties  executives, managers, and associates  acknowledge both their failures as well as their strengths. The purpose of this transparency is to strengthen the positive aspects of performance and improve the negative aspects.

**Mental/Self Expression**

The greatest way to strengthen mental energy is to create an environment in which laser focusing is encouraged and rewarded. The inability to direct absorbed focus to tasks has a detrimental effect on quality of work, and as such, distractions should be limited as much as possible.Some key tactics for strengthening mental energy are:

* Limiting distractions and encouraging employees to focus on one task at a time
* Discouraging multitasking
* Setting an agenda and sticking to it
* Focusing only on small amounts of information at a time
* Designating a specific start/stop time for meetings

**Spiritual/Significance**

As previously mentioned, employees absolutely must have a sense of greater purpose for the work they do; otherwise, they wont have anything to which they can commit fully, which is an integral component of engagement.

The job of executives is to create work that has a distinct purpose and is injected with company values. For that to happen, CEOs must first have a set of clear company values. Then, you must recruit and retain individuals whose values reflect those of the company. Both the employees and the company itself must share a common purpose; that way, as associates grow and increase their capacity, the organization also becomes stronger.

Schwartzs suggestions are valuable for organizations of any size, as they allow leaders to identify the ways in which they can empower employees to perform their best through energizing tactics. If you can employ the tactics above and drive focus towards company goals while simultaneously engaging and energizing your associates, youll create a powerful approach to management through which your best possible results will be achieved.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> By now, The One Minute Manager by Kenneth Blanchard, Ph.D. and Spencer Johnson, M.D., has become a classic. Aspiring and seasoned executives alike benefit from its managerial techniques, and it aims to solve the one of the biggest organizational problems of all time: balancing efforts to further your people as well as your results.

**1. Support Your People AND Results, Not Either/Or**

The book starts with an employee whos searching for the ideal manager  one who seeks to manage both his people and the outcomes for which theyre responsible, not one or the other. The manager who focuses too exclusively on results risks low morale and a disengaged workforce. The manager who focuses only on his peoples happiness is destined to fall short in terms of business outcomes.Whats the solution? The best manager knows how to set clear goals collaboratively with her people to engage them in challenges that will support company initiatives. She cares not only about her people, but how theyre progressing both with goals and personal growth.

**2. One Minute Is All You Need for Clear Goals**

The first step in achieving big results is setting clear goals. The authors believe that 80% of your most significant business outcomes will come from only 20% of your goals. Its doubly important, then, to set goals that have clear expectations. At Atiim, we believe clear and effective goal setting is such an integral part of performance management that weve based our entire OKR Goals Software on this very principle. Blanchard and Johnson recommend that everyone should know exactly whats expected for goals up front  there should not be any surprises, and it should only take one minute to explain the goal (Objective) and steps needed to get there (Key Results).

**3. Praise Can Be Accomplished in One Minute, Too**

Part of todays ongoing performance management is giving regular feedback. Praise is an important component of feedback  so much so that it should be done twice or three times as often as you criticize. So, when you observe an employee doing something well  whether its a big milestone or a small, weekly win  take a minute to praise him or her for it.The authors argument is that it only takes a minute or less to tell someone theyve done a good job, and thereby effectively encourage them to continue doing well in the future. It shows your team that you take a genuine interest in their success.

**4. One Minute Is Just Enough for Criticism**

On the opposite end of praise, we have criticism (or reprimand, as the authors call it). Because youre only taking a few moments to praise, its important not to reprimand for any period of time longer than that. Otherwise, employees might begin to think that their shortcomings are more significant than their strengths, and thats something you dont want to happen. Instead, take a brief minute to tackle any bad behavior head-on. Use this two-pronged approach to address an issue: tell the employee first what he or she did wrong, and allow it to sink in for a moment. (Yes, this part can be a bit uncomfortable.) Then, follow up by saying that you value the persons work and explain how much you think the employee is capable of  this is to reassure them, which must go hand-in-hand with reprimand. The idea is to emphasize the issue with the work, not the person.

Like praise, reprimands should be given in a timely manner. Catching an employee soon after the bad behavior took place will have a more positive impact for the future than bringing it up weeks after it happened.

<TITLE> Employee Engagement for Everyone by Kevin Kruse - Book Summary   Insights </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-27 12:55:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> While Kruse boldly appeals to everyone in his title, what both intrigued and impressed me is his rejection of the one-size-fits all approach to employee engagement. Instead, he recognizes that each business leader must identify a solution that fits the unique needs of his or her company.

**Employee Engagement Affects More than Profits**

The correlation between employee engagement and profits is alarming enough on its own  companies with engagement levels under 25% suffer negative total shareholders return, or TSR; (this and other eye-opening statistics linking profits to employee engagement collected by Kruse can be found here). Beyond profits, when you neglect employee engagement, youll also suffer in the areas of quality, safety, retention, service, and more.

**Use the Four Pillars to Improve Employee Engagement**

There are four essential aspects of employee engagement. They are trust, communication, growth, and recognition. How you balance the four pillars will depend on your organizational needs. Kruse provides detailed, actionable steps about how you can improve each aspect, but heres my overview:

* Growth. You must challenge all of your employees regularly and make advancement opportunities available.
* Communication. Check in frequently (once-per-year reviews no longer work, weekly check-ins do) and establish a two-way feedback loop with each of direct reports.
* Trust. Show everyone how they fit into company goals.
* Recognition. Lastly, giving praise and showing appreciation can go a long way in making employees feel their efforts are validated.

**Give Everyone a Role in Employee Engagement**

Interestingly, Kruse provides strategies that can be adopted by both executives AND their employees. Not only does he show us what we can do as leaders to drive engagement, but he presents simple solutions for employees to help show managers the ways in which they can be engaged most effectively at work. For employees, this puts some of the power in their own hands, and for leaders, it emphasizes the point that engagement is a unique endeavor that must fit well with company culture and can be further tailored to meet the needs of the individual.

**Address Actively Disengaged Employees**

Kruse refers to actively disengaged employees as Debbie Downers, and says that not only do we need to find unique solutions for handling them, but we must also avoid becoming one. This is of monumental importance, as active disengagement can easily become contagious if not handled appropriately. Find the solution that fits best with your company culture by asking your employees questions about morale in your weekly progress reports.

**Dont Treat Engagement as a Top-Down Issue**

As previously mentioned, EVERYONE can play a part in driving employee engagement. That means that CEOs alone shouldnt carry the burden of improving engagement; rather, it needs to be a team-wide initiative. Managers are best suited for overseeing the employee engagement of their direct reports, so collaborate with them to develop solutions for improving engagement. They may have better ideas about how you can use team-targeted engagement solutions to drive focus, performance, and commitment, and ultimately, achieve aggressive goals to secure big wins.

<TITLE> [Misc] Book Insights from Work Rules!: Insights from inside Google by Laszlo Bock. Most pertain to Googles People Operations, modern equivalent of HR </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-27 12:47:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Improve Performance with OKR Goals**

One way to drive performance is by emphasizing personal growth. One of the reasons Google uses OKR Goals  and why **theyre so powerful  is because they simultaneously drive personal growth by encouraging employees to meet their own individual objectives while contributing to company goals,** since all priorities are aligned.

OKRs consist of Objectives and Key Results. Some Objectives should be aspirational, while others can be operational. Key Results are used to determine what needs to be done to accomplish the Objectives, and should be measurable.

Google still uses OKRs to this day. Not only are they effective for accomplishing goals, but research demonstrates that you can improve employee performance when you invite individuals to be committed to their goals. Likewise, youll improve employee engagement when you collaborate with your people to set ambitious, specific goals. Treat Your People like theyre Irreplaceable

Bock said that prior to his experience at Google, he was frustrated with the fact that **leaders always spoke of putting people first, and then treated them like replaceable gears.** Google, however, has an incredibly stringent hiring process. Google recruiters use sample work tests to see their candidates in action, and they tend to hire individuals with ambition and curiosity over experience.

If you take the time to hire the right people, they really will become irreplaceable. And thats a benefit for both you and your hires: when you find the right fit, Bock says, people require less training, and on top of that, employees will be put in a position where they can really use and build upon their strengths.

**Learn to Give Feedback Separately from Consequences**

Your aim in providing ongoing employee feedback should be to drive performance. When someone is performing below your expectations, the feedback you provide shouldnt be about repercussions, it should be focused on giving that employee everything he needs to succeed (resources, information, and clear expectations, etc.). Compensation and promotions are separate entities, and are therefore are not main components of your ongoing, continuous loop of feedback.

**Use Actions to Support Your Mission**

Every company should have a mission, but more importantly, Bock believes that **each companys mission should be specific and driven by actions and activities.** If your mission is too vague, or if you never drive your mission through tangible actions, its likely that it wont resonate with your employees.

**Dont Weigh Your Company Down with Rules**

Bock recommends trusting your employees to do the right thing without setting forth too many strict guidelines. He believes that **when too many rules are enforced, creativity and motivation are diminished,** thereby thwarting productivity.

**Never Start Out with Negative Assumptions**

**Managers and execs who start out with the belief that their people are inherently good will fare better than others,** according to Bock. If you start out with the assumption that your employees are out to rip you off, you risk developing a rule-driven, negative environment in which employees do only whats required of them from the get go. Bock believes that this sort of optimism is what sets great organizations apart from others, because its there that people can truly excel, thrive, and do their best work.

**Excel by using Small Experiments**

Google takes an interesting approach in trying out new systems and tools: they try them out, as would a scientific researcher, on different groups of people before implementing them fully. Always fond of data, Google execs will study the performance quality and morale of the test groups to see how well the new tool or system is working. You, too, can **collect insights from your employees after you try new things** by retrieving data through your weekly progress reports.

**Build Trust and Commitment through Transparency**

Bock advocates always keeping your employees in the loop about whats going on inside the company. This, he says, fosters commitment, because it encourages employees to think that theyre all in it together. The emphasis in your company should be on unity, not on division. As such, you need to remain open and transparent on all levels. Without that transparency, you wont be able to build trust, and your people will be less likely to commit fully to your company.

**Take Advantage of Mistakes**

Google encourages its employees to take sensible risks, and as such, they acknowledge that failure is sometimes inevitable. But as Bock notes, failures can breed intelligence  people tend to learn more after mistakes than they do when things go smoothly. Failures can actually be successes, because they ultimately foster growth and development. Yet, in order to achieve that growth and development, you must let your people know that its okay to make mistakes.

<TITLE> Book Insights from Elon Musk by Ashlee Vance </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-21 20:08:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Use your Past to Fuel Future Motivation**

In this biography, we learn that Elon Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa. He had a less-than-ideal upbringing, and his family life was tumultuous. Vance reveals that Musk never felt as if he fit in with the culture  which idealized athletes and jocks  in Pretoria, and as his family quibbles escalated over the years, he envisioned a way in which he could escape. Despite an imperfect start, however, Musk remained extremely ambitious into his later years.

**Network with People who Identify with Your Passions**

During his time at the University of Pennsylvania, Musk began to associate with physics majors, who were aligned with his interests and passions. After spending some time with his like-minded cohorts, it became apparent that Musk, too, was of similar intellect: he received a 98 on a paper on solar energy during his senior year. His enthusiasm extended beyond receiving good grades: When I was in college, I wanted to be involved with things that would change the world, Musk said. What we can all learn from Musk is that working with like-minded people often yields impressive results, because shared passions are a powerful tool in any entrepreneurial endeavor.

**Be Willing to Put in Long Days and Late Nights (at least in the beginning)**

Musks original startup, Zip2, didnt take off right away. In fact, it required many late nights, during which Musk would actually sleep under his desk. Hed ask other employees to wake him in the morning so that he could start working again. This kind of relentless drive and dedication is what Musk used to build not only startups, but startups that were sustainable.

**Know when to Practice Restraint**

In 2000, Musks fellow executives cast him aside as CEO of the company that would eventually become PayPal. Despite being forced into a lower position, Musk refused to react bitterly towards the other execs. Instead, Musk remained supportive of the company. He was PayPals largest shareholder, and by 2003, his shares amounted to $250 million. Having restraint when facing challenges at work  especially those that may seem personal  can help you to succeed in the long run.

**Communicate Openly**

For a period of time, Musk evaded the public eye. While some speculate that he might be a shy individual, Musk learned quickly that CEOs and entrepreneurs must be comfortable with an open exchange of regular communication to be respected  and to garner positive attention for their companies. Musk is active on Twitter, and he believes that CEOs and other execs must assume a role of responsibility in communicating with their target audiences about their products or services.

<TITLE> Ways to Increase Photographer's Income </TITLE>

<TEXT> * Expand Outside Your Niche - When expanding your niche, products, or services, be purposeful about what you offer. You dont want to give clients so much choice that youre spread too thin or that the quality of your work suffers.
* Get Into Stock Photography - Do some research regarding what types of stock photos are hot right now. If American flag is popular, find ways to take interesting photos of the American flag to capitalize on its popularity. Mix trending needs in with old standards (i.e. landscapes and portraits) so your stock collection has good variety.
* Work With Local Businesses to Photograph Their Products or Services - Try to schedule your shoots with local businesses during times of day when you typically have down time, like the lunch hour or after 5 pm. That way the work doesnt interfere with your regular schedule. Also try to schedule these shoots back-to-back so you can minimize the time spent traveling to and from the locations.
* Work as a Second Shooter - Dont discount the value of what you can learn as a second shooter. Wedding photography is a high-stress gig, and the way that wedding photographers manage that stress and get high-quality photos under so much pressure is often masterful.
* Offer Your Editing Services - When pricing your services, try to balance setting the price low enough to attract attention while being high enough to be worthy of your time. Also think about the time youll spend outside of the task - checking emails, writing job proposals, fielding phone calls, etc. - that will take up time in your day.
* Partner With Insurance Companies - Consider working with local insurance agencies as a photographer as well. Often, small offices require their agents to go out and photograph properties or vehicles, but if your price is right, they might contract with you instead.
* Photograph Local Events - If youre hired to document a local event, dont spend your time tooting your own horn and schmoozing the crowd by handing out business cards.
* Teach Others - If you have portrait photography skills, consider approaching local schools to serve as their school picture photographer. Its a gig that only lasts a few weeks in the fall and can supplement your income nicely.

<TITLE> Employee Engagement for Everyone by Kevin Kruse - Book Summary   Insights </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-15 14:52:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> While Kruse boldly appeals to everyone in his title, what both intrigued and impressed me is his rejection of the one-size-fits all approach to employee engagement. Instead, he recognizes that each business leader must identify a solution that fits the unique needs of his or her company.

**Employee Engagement Affects More than Profits**

The correlation between employee engagement and profits is alarming enough on its own  companies with engagement levels under 25% suffer negative total shareholders return, or TSR; (this and other eye-opening statistics linking profits to employee engagement collected by Kruse can be found here). Beyond profits, when you neglect employee engagement, youll also suffer in the areas of quality, safety, retention, service, and more.

**Use the Four Pillars to Improve Employee Engagement**

There are four essential aspects of employee engagement. They are trust, communication, growth, and recognition. How you balance the four pillars will depend on your organizational needs. Kruse provides detailed, actionable steps about how you can improve each aspect, but heres my overview:

* Growth. You must challenge all of your employees regularly and make advancement opportunities available.
* Communication. Check in frequently (once-per-year reviews no longer work, weekly check-ins do) and establish a two-way feedback loop with each of direct reports.
* Trust. Show everyone how they fit into company goals.
* Recognition. Lastly, giving praise and showing appreciation can go a long way in making employees feel their efforts are validated.

**Give Everyone a Role in Employee Engagement**

Interestingly, Kruse provides strategies that can be adopted by both executives AND their employees. Not only does he show us what we can do as leaders to drive engagement, but he presents simple solutions for employees to help show managers the ways in which they can be engaged most effectively at work. For employees, this puts some of the power in their own hands, and for leaders, it emphasizes the point that engagement is a unique endeavor that must fit well with company culture and can be further tailored to meet the needs of the individual.

**Address Actively Disengaged Employees**

Kruse refers to actively disengaged employees as Debbie Downers, and says that not only do we need to find unique solutions for handling them, but we must also avoid becoming one. This is of monumental importance, as active disengagement can easily become contagious if not handled appropriately. Find the solution that fits best with your company culture by asking your employees questions about morale in your weekly progress reports.

**Dont Treat Engagement as a Top-Down Issue**

As previously mentioned, EVERYONE can play a part in driving employee engagement. That means that CEOs alone shouldnt carry the burden of improving engagement; rather, it needs to be a team-wide initiative. Managers are best suited for overseeing the employee engagement of their direct reports, so collaborate with them to develop solutions for improving engagement. They may have better ideas about how you can use team-targeted engagement solutions to drive focus, performance, and commitment, and ultimately, achieve aggressive goals to secure big wins.

<TITLE> Book Insights from Elon Musk by Ashlee Vance </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-15 14:03:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Use your Past to Fuel Future Motivation**

In this biography, we learn that Elon Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa. He had a less-than-ideal upbringing, and his family life was tumultuous. Vance reveals that Musk never felt as if he fit in with the culture  which idealized athletes and jocks  in Pretoria, and as his family quibbles escalated over the years, he envisioned a way in which he could escape. Despite an imperfect start, however, Musk remained extremely ambitious into his later years.

**Network with People who Identify with Your Passions**

During his time at the University of Pennsylvania, Musk began to associate with physics majors, who were aligned with his interests and passions. After spending some time with his like-minded cohorts, it became apparent that Musk, too, was of similar intellect: he received a 98 on a paper on solar energy during his senior year. His enthusiasm extended beyond receiving good grades: When I was in college, I wanted to be involved with things that would change the world, Musk said. What we can all learn from Musk is that working with like-minded people often yields impressive results, because shared passions are a powerful tool in any entrepreneurial endeavor.

**Be Willing to Put in Long Days and Late Nights (at least in the beginning)**

Musks original startup, Zip2, didnt take off right away. In fact, it required many late nights, during which Musk would actually sleep under his desk. Hed ask other employees to wake him in the morning so that he could start working again. This kind of relentless drive and dedication is what Musk used to build not only startups, but startups that were sustainable.

**Know when to Practice Restraint**

In 2000, Musks fellow executives cast him aside as CEO of the company that would eventually become PayPal. Despite being forced into a lower position, Musk refused to react bitterly towards the other execs. Instead, Musk remained supportive of the company. He was PayPals largest shareholder, and by 2003, his shares amounted to $250 million. Having restraint when facing challenges at work  especially those that may seem personal  can help you to succeed in the long run.

**Communicate Openly**

For a period of time, Musk evaded the public eye. While some speculate that he might be a shy individual, Musk learned quickly that CEOs and entrepreneurs must be comfortable with an open exchange of regular communication to be respected  and to garner positive attention for their companies. Musk is active on Twitter, and he believes that CEOs and other execs must assume a role of responsibility in communicating with their target audiences about their products or services.

<DATE> 2017-02-08 16:55:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> * **Strategy   Execution**  The CEO must set the vision, must know how to get his company there, and must execute and manage operational execution towards that vision (which at an early stage is a ton of arduous work without resources). 
* **Recruit A-Players**  Build out a great team (thats 80% of the battle).
* **Sales**  The CEO must be the first sales rep of the company and needs to build a predictable and repeatable process that scales sales with newly hired sales reps.
* **Marketing**  The CEO must do the marketing to get those leads into the sales funnel he must evangelize the company and then do something innovative to be able to build a cost-effective customer acquisition funnel.
* **Cash**  Its all about growing sales while keeping a laser focus on managing money effectively.
* **Resourcefulness**  this is the least talked about role of a startup CEO but this one is probably the most critical success factor of a startup CEO and is far more critical than for someone who is a CEO of a billion dollar company.

<TITLE> Book Insights from Work Rules!: Insights from inside Google by Laszlo Bock. Most pertain to Googles People Operations, modern equivalent of HR </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Improve Performance with OKR Goals**

One way to drive performance is by emphasizing personal growth. One of the reasons Google uses OKR Goals  and why **theyre so powerful  is because they simultaneously drive personal growth by encouraging employees to meet their own individual objectives while contributing to company goals,** since all priorities are aligned.

OKRs consist of Objectives and Key Results. Some Objectives should be aspirational, while others can be operational. Key Results are used to determine what needs to be done to accomplish the Objectives, and should be measurable.

Google still uses OKRs to this day. Not only are they effective for accomplishing goals, but research demonstrates that you can improve employee performance when you invite individuals to be committed to their goals. Likewise, youll improve employee engagement when you collaborate with your people to set ambitious, specific goals. Treat Your People like theyre Irreplaceable

Bock said that prior to his experience at Google, he was frustrated with the fact that **leaders always spoke of putting people first, and then treated them like replaceable gears.** Google, however, has an incredibly stringent hiring process. Google recruiters use sample work tests to see their candidates in action, and they tend to hire individuals with ambition and curiosity over experience.

If you take the time to hire the right people, they really will become irreplaceable. And thats a benefit for both you and your hires: when you find the right fit, Bock says, people require less training, and on top of that, employees will be put in a position where they can really use and build upon their strengths.

**Learn to Give Feedback Separately from Consequences**

Your aim in providing ongoing employee feedback should be to drive performance. When someone is performing below your expectations, the feedback you provide shouldnt be about repercussions, it should be focused on giving that employee everything he needs to succeed (resources, information, and clear expectations, etc.). Compensation and promotions are separate entities, and are therefore are not main components of your ongoing, continuous loop of feedback.

**Use Actions to Support Your Mission**

Every company should have a mission, but more importantly, Bock believes that **each companys mission should be specific and driven by actions and activities.** If your mission is too vague, or if you never drive your mission through tangible actions, its likely that it wont resonate with your employees.

**Dont Weigh Your Company Down with Rules**

Bock recommends trusting your employees to do the right thing without setting forth too many strict guidelines. He believes that **when too many rules are enforced, creativity and motivation are diminished,** thereby thwarting productivity.

**Never Start Out with Negative Assumptions**

**Managers and execs who start out with the belief that their people are inherently good will fare better than others,** according to Bock. If you start out with the assumption that your employees are out to rip you off, you risk developing a rule-driven, negative environment in which employees do only whats required of them from the get go. Bock believes that this sort of optimism is what sets great organizations apart from others, because its there that people can truly excel, thrive, and do their best work.

**Excel by using Small Experiments**

Google takes an interesting approach in trying out new systems and tools: they try them out, as would a scientific researcher, on different groups of people before implementing them fully. Always fond of data, Google execs will study the performance quality and morale of the test groups to see how well the new tool or system is working. You, too, can **collect insights from your employees after you try new things** by retrieving data through your weekly progress reports.

**Build Trust and Commitment through Transparency**

Bock advocates always keeping your employees in the loop about whats going on inside the company. This, he says, fosters commitment, because it encourages employees to think that theyre all in it together. The emphasis in your company should be on unity, not on division. As such, you need to remain open and transparent on all levels. Without that transparency, you wont be able to build trust, and your people will be less likely to commit fully to your company.

**Take Advantage of Mistakes**

Google encourages its employees to take sensible risks, and as such, they acknowledge that failure is sometimes inevitable. But as Bock notes, failures can breed intelligence  people tend to learn more after mistakes than they do when things go smoothly. Failures can actually be successes, because they ultimately foster growth and development. Yet, in order to achieve that growth and development, you must let your people know that its okay to make mistakes.

<TITLE> Book Insights from "High Output Management" by Andrew S. Grove </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-03 13:00:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Master the Basics of Production**

In order to have an effective production system, Grove says that all execs and managers must consider the following three components:

* Time
* Quality
* Cost

The way in which you handle these components will determine how effective your production processes are. Production takes place in three stages:

* Process
* Assembly
* Test

You may also have whats known as a limiting step; or, the process that requires the most amount of time to complete, and therefore deserves the most attention.

While these are basics with which many managers and execs are already very familiar, Groves crash-course on production is especially beneficial for new entrepreneurs.

**Identify Your Indicators**

Grove says that in order to achieve sustainable scalability, youll need to establish some indicators. The best types of indicators measure the actual output  not just the activity itself. They should be measurable, and ideally, they should be accompanied by a metric indicating a timeframe and a quantity. These concepts go hand-in-hand with OKRs, which is the most effective way to integrate indicators in your company.

Grove identifies two main types of indicators:

* Leading Indicators: These should measure and/or evaluate input and predict output
* Trend Indicators: These should measure output within a given period of time, such as a quarter or month

**Implement Managerial Leverage**

Grove defines a managers output as the output of his or her organization combined with the output of neighboring organizations, or other organizations under his or her influence. The managerial leverage, then, is defined as the measure of output created by any of the managers activity. Effective managers have a greater influence on neighboring organizations.

According to Grove, these are the primary responsibilities of a manager:

* Information Gathering
* Information Giving
* Decision Making
* Nudging

Managers can also delegate, but that requires both managers and their direct reports to have access to the same information.

Grove recommends that supervisory managers have 6-8 subordinates. Having fewer subordinates could lead to meddling, while having more creates chaos and confusion.

In addition to the points listed above, Grove believes that managers should do their best to achieve regularity, and avoid interruptions whenever possible. Batch processing is an effective way to complete tasks, and managers must also designate specific me time to complete their duties.

**Get the Most out of your Meetings**

Grove considers meetings to be a high-leverage medium, but only when they are used effectively. He identifies two main types of meetings:

* Process-Oriented Meetings These meetings should consist of an exchange of information, and they should always be scheduled. Grove advocates holding weekly one-on-one meetings between managers and direct reports. Staff meetings should only be held to discuss any matters involving more than two people, all of whom should be present. Operational meetings should open with presentations, and they should be used to review achievements and ongoing processes.
* Mission-Oriented Meetings These meetings can be ad-hoc, but they must be driven by an output, and they require a chairman.

**Become a Strategic Decision-Maker**

When managers and execs make decisions, they typically happen in three stages:

* Free Discussion All parties involved in the decision making process should be able to partake in the discussion as equals. Grove says that one of the greatest challenges that prevents good decision making is the fact that many people are hesitant to speak freely, thereby shielding some of the critical information that could be used to inform important decisions.
* Clear Decision A decision is made based on the free discussion.
* Full Support

While support wont always entail complete agreement by all parties, it should always involve commitment by everyone involved. Grove believes that when making decisions, you should always consult others first.

**Plan Wisely**

In High Output Management, planning is considered to be a three-step process that involves:

* Studying Your Environment
* Predicting the Future
* Reconciling

Grove recommends using MBO to assess your performance, but to take it a step further and optimize efficiency, his OKRs are a suitable practice to aid in planning.

Effective planning is critical to performance. Grove believes that failure to execute is a result of failed planning of the past. Also, he advises that managers and execs bear in mind that their resources are finite. When you approve one project, you are ultimately saying no to something else.

**Determine Your Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)**

Grove believes that there is no single, optimal style of management. Instead, he argues that your output is a result of a few different variables. These variables make up your Task-Relevant Maturity. It incorporates the following:

* Your Degree of Achievement-Orientation
* Your Readiness to Responsibility
* Training
* Experience

When managers have a high TRM, they are more likely to delegate. As a result, this increases their managerial leverage. They generally have minimal involvement in their direct reports operations, but they establish regular monitoring practices. Individuals with medium TRM tend to have individual-oriented session, and establish consistent, closed-loop communication. Low TRM managers usually rely on task-specific session, and are very specific in their expectations of what, when, and how.

**Tackle Performance Management with this Two-Pronged Approach**

Reviewing performance is the single most important form of task-relevant feedback, according to Grove. Your objective in assessing an employees performance should be to improve his or performance by advancing skills and boosting motivation. This can be achieved in two ways: assessment and delivery.

* Assessment: You can only assess an individuals performance if you provide clarity in your expectations ahead of time. You must specifically define output measures, including productions, reports, designs, and so forth; and you must also establish internal measures, such as hiring, planning, etc. Bear in mind that you must never evaluate people against what you perceive as their potential; rather, you must evaluate them based on their output. Again, Groves OKRs are advantageous in achieving clarity and defining expectations in advance.
* Delivery: When it comes to ensuring delivery, you should aim to achieve commitment from your people. Level with them by focusing on the individual  always listen first, and then try to establish a solution.

**Train Effectively and Compensate Fairly**

Grove believes that motivating and training employees should be the sole responsibility of the boss. Training should always fit with your company culture and processes, and more importantly, training should be approached as an ongoing, evolving process  not simply a one-time event.

Employee compensation can be based on two factors: merit and experience. Many organizations use a blend of the two to determine salary. When an employee receives a promotion, it should always be tied to his or her performance.

<TEXT> [15 Great Insights from the Google OKR Goals Video](https://www.atiim.com/blog/15-great-insights-from-the-google-okr-video/):

* 2:07  Companies should fight the urge to say: Well, Google did it that way and, Thats Google, we could never be like them, etc. As Klau put it, Google wasnt even Google until they began using OKRs  it was just a young and ambitious company. In other words, it could work for any company.
* 4:40  The reason Google was so attracted to OKRs is because they provide data. The setting, tracking, and measuring of objectives and their corresponding key results provides concrete data, which can be used to benefit any organization.
* 8:50  OKRs are connected across the individual, team, and company levels. Klau uses the example of a football team: the head coach, defensive coordinator, and individual player each has his own set of OKRs, but they are all connected to the overall goals of winning games and selling tickets.
* 12:30  Objectives should be a bit uncomfortable. As Klau puts it, if you know youre going to nail it, youre not trying hard enough.
* 13:50  All OKRs contribute to company-level goals, but each individuals set of OKRs is not necessarily a company-wide priority. Back to the football comparison: although the defensive coordinator may not be concerned with getting a feature in the Sunday paper like the PR team is, each team and individuals OKRs all align back to the main priorities, which are playing well and achieving high attendance.
* 15:52  OKRs inherently create discipline and transparency within an organization, because everyone can see what everyone else is working on.
* 18:37  The writing and collaborating processes of developing OKRs often becomes a cyclical process  Klau uses term virtuous cycle.
* 21:00  Allowing individuals to be a part of the OKR writing process could open up new discussions, and perhaps even provide new insights for upper-level management and other leaders.
* 24:50  More than half of the objectives should come from the bottom up; in order for OKRs to be effective, they cannot all be dictated down from the top.
* 32:30  Its important to understand the difference between objectives and key results; Klau explains the two by using examples of actual OKRs that he composed in the past.
* 42:00  In his examples of past OKRs, Klau refers to making a measurable impact with Blogger  but we wonder if that phrase could be better defined. A measurable impact to him might not be the same to another person. This one wasnt so concrete and failed to have a number  which went against what he said earlier in the presentation, that each OKR should have a number with it.
* 54:00  Low scores on OKRs should not be viewed as failures, because they still provide data and can act as a road map for the following quarters objectives.
* 55:30  According to Klau, OKRs dont take a ton of time. He further says that leaders can establish a rhythm very quickly when it comes to implementing and grading OKRs.
* 1:06:15  Klau says you only need to have 1-2 one-on-one meeting per quarter. Yet, because data and feedback are crucial, weekly one-on-ones may better facilitate the OKR process. Having regular check-ins could prevent the need for the lengthy quarterly meetings Klau kept referring to, as well as formal, antiquated performance reviews.
* 1:16:50  In response to a question about when a management team should adopt OKRs  Klau answers, as soon as possible. He says even if youre a team of five, the earlier you adopt OKRs, the easier it will be. </TEXT>

<TITLE> David Allen on 5 Reasons for a Meeting </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-30 07:15:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ever find yourself wondering why youre in a meeting or what the meeting is trying to accomplish? Here is a classic article from David Allen on 5 Reasons for a Meeting. Enjoy!

There are five reasons to have a meeting. Each may be a perfectly fine reason. Make sure everyone at your meeting knows and agrees with which of these you are there to accomplish.

1. GIVE INFORMATION
Hello everyone. Ive brought you all together today to let you know whats been going on about the pending lawsuit. Id like you to leave here today understanding whats going on, and with as much background as you need to be able to answer questions that may arise from our customers.

2. GET INFORMATION
Thanks for coming. Weve invited you all here to find out from everyone what we should be aware of thats going on in your division relative to the new product roll-out. We want to know whats happening at all levels in the organization about this, so we can make some adjustments in our plans accordingly.

3. DEVELOP OPTIONS
Wed like to spend this afternoon surfacing, formulating, and exploring as many possible ways to deal with the problem weve just uncovered in the new system implementation. We want to make sure weve got everyones perspectives and all the possible
alternatives formulated.

4. MAKE DECISIONS
Weve brought you all together this morning to present to you the three proposed approaches to launching our new product, and get a consensus decision on which one to pursue.

5. WARM MAGICAL HUMAN CONTACT
There are three agenda items we would like to cover today. And though we could have done this by email, we wanted to have an opportunity to bring the new team together in one place, and get some time to get to know each other between the lines

You may often have more than one of these agendassometimes even all five. Today Im going to share some information with you, and get some information from you as well. Were then going to explore some possible approaches to the situation, and then decide our best course of action. Meanwhile it will give us a chance to get to know each other a little more as real people

Pretty common sense stuff. Right. But, ever sat in a room with someone trying to make a decision, someone else just wanting to do some brainstorming about some possibilities, some people just wanting to get to know who theyre working with, and someone else just wanting to get some information about the situation? And they all wind up wanting to kill each other?

Its very valuable to get clarification and agreement on the front end, as to which of the five reasons for a meeting you have going on.

David Allen

Start by cutting up your broccoli. You will want to cut off the big stem and trim your florets so they have small stems left on them.

Make sure to give your tomatoes a good scrubbing to get all of the wax off and dry them.

For the bell pepper, I washed, removed all the of insides, and cut in super slim strips.

Once you have all of your veggies rinsed and cut, its time to assemble. 

After you get your tree assembled, add some pretzel sticks to create a tree trunk! Serve with ranch or a dipping sauce of your choice and you are done! </TEXT>

<TEXT> In 1811, Henry Brackenridge found the ruins of an ancient city near St. Louis.
But the world ignored Brackenridges discovery, and Americans have not treated it with reverence. Four-lane roads and highways surround and bisect Cahokia, the sprawl of East St. Louis covers more of the ancient site, and many of the earthen pyramids have been scraped away to use as infill.
Cahokia has since been dignified with a state park and visitors center, but its not well known outside of Illinois and Missouri. It hardly attracts the number of visitors youd expect for Americas version of the pyramids and the ruins of the countrys greatest, ancient city.  </TEXT>

Vladimir Putin is a thug and a murderer and a killer and a KGB agent, he said. ...Lets call Vladimir Putin for what he is. Does that mean you dont deal with him or talk to him? Of course you talk to him. But you do it the way that Ronald Reagan did, and thats from a position of strength. </TEXT>

Some spun an elaborate theory of justification, comparing the Russian genocide of the Chechens to the American civil war - ignoring the fact that a civil war is fought by people of the same nation whereas the Chechens are not Russians and Chechnya is not Russia. Even President Clinton was brainwashed into mouthing similarly inappropriate excuses for Mr. Yeltsin and his fellow killers." </TEXT>

The footage can be seen as a group of about 25-30 people, a large part of them - the children, literally crawling in mud and water on the river bank. It should be noted that the air temperature in Surgut on this day was +5 degrees. It is obvious that many participants "March - throw" what is happening is clearly not a pleasure.

<TEXT> Regarding the first question:
Section 80 says:
"audio recording medium for **the private use** of the person who makes the copy does not constitute an infringement" So it all depends on the purposes which this copy will be used for.

Regarding the second question:
Section 29 says:
"Fair dealing for the purpose of research, private study, education, **parody or satire** does not infringe copyright"
So Canada, as well as the United States considers parody as "fair dealing" (~"fair use").

This picture is 100% parody. I do not know about the specific lawsuits in Canada but in the US a parody - it is one of the most winning tactics to prove that the defendant's content actually corresponds to "fair use" and does not violate plaintiff's copyright, the most typical example is Campbell vs Acuff-Rose case

https://np.reddit.com/r/ShrinkTheWeb/comments/4dc9dc/is_it_legal_to_display_screenshots_of_web_pages/ - here is my very short analysis of such US cases regarding copyrighted images

<TEXT> Capturing - is auto-generation of PNG or JPEG images from web pages or online PDF documents (like Facebook does than you post a link there). And currently still there are lots of problems with capturing documents with some complex encodings. So point of my submit here is - try to avoid exotic characters and encodings (like LaTeX) on first (title) page of a PDF document to let it be captured properly, to create its thumbnail picture exactly corresponding to title page of the document. </TEXT>

By RACHEL EMMA SILVERMAN March 15, 2015 5:55 p.m. ET

A pair of court rulings involving Lyft Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. may have far-reaching consequences for the ride-sharing firms, and may help to bring clarity to a murky but increasingly important area of employment law.
Two San Francisco judges separately ruled last week that suits filed by drivers of the ride-sharing services should go before juries. At issue in both cases is whether drivers, who are employed as independent contractors, should be considered employees of those firms, and thus entitled to the protections afforded most full-time workers.

A verdict that required Lyft or Uber to reclassify their drivers as employees would throw a wrench in business models that have commanded large investments and valuations. Last week, Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten led a $ 530 million round of funding for Lyft, helping to boost its valuation to more than $ 2.5 billion. Uber, which is much larger, has raised more than $ 5 billion in funding and is valued at more than $ 41 billion.

Should the cases proceed to trial, the resulting verdicts could also set a legal precedent about how many workers should be classified in the so-called on-demand economy. That could come as welcome news for employment lawyers and others charged with figuring out whether the workers who fulfill Instacart orders, drive UberX passengers, clean homes for Handy clients and perform other tasks assigned by apps should be considered independent contractors or actual employees.

Plaintiffs in both cases argue that drivers should be considered employees, not independents, and should thereby be protected by the same wage and labor rules as employees. The drivers also argue that they should be reimbursed for expenses such as gas and car maintenance that they currently pay out of pocket.

The plaintiffs suing Uber say they should be treated as employees because the company allegedly exerts significant control over their work, sets compensation and vehicle standards, and can terminate drivers at will. As part of the case, Uber was forced to release a series of internal emails on driver termination to the court, showing that drivers could be "deactivated" for passenger ratings that fall below 4.5 on a five-point scale.

In the Uber case, heard in San Francisco, US District Judge Edward Chen denied the company's motion for summary judgment, concluding that the plaintiffs "perform services for the benefit of Uber," and that the question of their employment status "presents a mixed question of law and fact that must typically be resolved by a jury."

Similarly, in the courtroom next door to Judge Chen's, US District Judge Vince Chhabria, presiding over the Lyft case, ruled that because California's "outmoded" test for classifying workers "provides nothing remotely close to a clear answer, it will often be for juries to decide." </TEXT>
