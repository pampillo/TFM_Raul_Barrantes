<TEXT> Hey, keep going. I've suffered from OCD and depression for nearly twenty years and haven't found the state services much help. I had to seek out healing off my own bat mostly. I'd say do a lot of research online to what can help you and see if you can access it somehow. Something that helped me a lot was going for weekend meditation retreats, meditation is really good for my anxiety and for mental health in general. I don't know a lot about bpd, so I'm sorry I can't give you any specific advice, I'd just like you to know there's a lot of people out there suffering from mental health problems, you're not alone. Almost everybody in Ireland, if they don't have one themselves, have a family member with one. It's something I discovered when I decided to be upfront about my own condition, people would immediately tell me about their's or their loved ones. It was a relief for them to finally be able to be open about it, you'd be amazed. You can also be amazed at the progress you can make, I still have bad moments but I've come on leaps and bounds. Never lose hope, you can get better, you can learn to cope and heal. Take care. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've suffered from OCD for almost two decades. How has it affected my life? It's a bit like being mentally crippled, nobody can see it but you're struggling all the time just to make it through the day.  The most beneficial healing method for me has been meditation, I been to three weekend retreats and they've each given great healing. I've always depended on a strong faith in God and clung to the hope it will get better (it has!). A few years ago I started keeping a journal which allows me to express my anxieties and separate myself from them a little and also pray for healing. Obviously, I've been on meds for years, but they just keep the lid on the pot tightly clamped, they do nothing to reduce the heat or release any steam. It's frustrating how the psychiatric profession has bought into the idea drugs are the answer to everything, they're not by a long shot. I've started teaching meditation to kids now, so I hope the next generation will be given better coping tools than we were. I feel like all the different media they are exposed to is creating a battleground in their minds where they are never good enough, which is the basis of all advertising. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love the assassin girl, thought she was great. The one I have a problem with is guy playing Dirk Gently who portrays him as a total fuckwit. I read the books years ago and that isn't the sense I got of the character, he was more of a chancer/fraud who had accidently stumbled on a secret of the universe he didn't understand himself but played it for all it was worth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This article, from the socialist magazine Jacobin, tells how Victorian values, far from been cast off or transcended, have merely mutated into new manifestations designed to bolster class superiority with feelings of moral superiority. Fitness, organic food, child rearing have all become area in which the middle classes can demonstrate their moral superiority to both the decadent one per cent and the feckless poor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been on reddit a long time and it's only in the last two years I've notice a very right wing sentiment on reddit Ireland. Any post about refugees or travellers and the comment section is just filled with hatred. It's fucking disturbing. It's picking on the weakest in society, the powerless. Posts about the powerful who are ripping off regular people (Nama, Bankers etc) don't get near as much vitriol. I hope it's such a small minority (like they say about football hooligans) but I'm afraid if this the direction the Irish people's mentality is going in general.  I hope not, I don't know, this sub isn't the way I remember it as a fairly liberal, easy going place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This isn't really an indepth article, but I think it covered a very interesting subject - education. We've all been through different school systems and many of us, at least I did, had an unhappy time. I think a rethink of education, it's methods and it's goal, is badly needed to nurture well balanced, psychologically health and well balanced people. Finland are the one country with the courage to try a totally different approach and they consistently top the ratings of best education leagues. I would like to hear what Trueredditors think about how education could be improved to benefit children and society. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's an interesting idea, possibly more appealing to unionists than a united Ireland run from Dublin. Would give each region more powers so would appeal to Southerners as well possibly. But do we have regional governments plus a national government. The division of powers would be the biggest issue I think, what is regional and what is national policy? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My friend got a motor bike when I was young and at first I was terrified riding on the back of it. I was too proud to admit it though and kept getting on. One time I got on and mentally shrugged my shoulders and thought 'if I die, I die'. I lost my fear and enjoyed the ride. I guess it was accepting it wasn't in my hands and surrendering control of my fate gave me peace and allowed me to live in the moment.  </TEXT>

This leads to uncompetitive races, nothing breeds apathy more than knowing your vote doesn't count. Legalized corruption in the form of campaign donations also feed the feeling of impotence in the electorate. The truth is they are not represented in Washington. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is an interesting article about a book that highlights the role drug use played in the Third Reich. I've often thought the image of Hitler ranting and raving hysterical is best explained by his reliance on crystal meth (injected in an early liquid form). It is news to me that he was also addicted to injections of an early form of oxycodene. It's explains a lot about his delusions and bad decision making in the later years of the war. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought it was great, a real enjoyable movie with great music and good characterisation and fun 80's nostalgia. It's a real shame it wasn't a bigger hit. The only complaint I would have is the actor playing the lead is too meek. To do the things that character does in the movie, he would have to have a streak of hurt and anger in him, but he doesn't have it. Jack Reynor is brilliant as the older brother though, as is the girl who plays the love interest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All sales throughout the world (apart from America) are put through an Apple company in Ireland. Apple declared 50 million through this company. The rest, 13.95 billion, they said went to a head-quarters. But this head-quarters only exists on paper, it has no employees and is stateless, so apple paid 0 tax on this money. RTE did a good explanation on in the 6.01 news, but that was effectively it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't ever let go of the hope that there is a bright future ahead of you. I know you can't see it now, but that's just now, there are a lot of twists and turns in life. Feeling hopeless can lead you down the path of depression, something I've experienced a lot of and something that helped keep me going was a hope that someday my life could be better, that I could enjoy it again, even though I couldn't see how that could happen from where I was. I guess that's called having faith. Hope is a flickering candle in your hand, don't ever let it go out, or if it does, relight it, it's really important to survive the dark times. There are better times ahead, I assure you. And at least you are willing to reach out and to change things, that's a big positive sign. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey. I've been through years of depression and ocd, I know how hard it can be. The best advice I can give you is get into meditation, it's free and it really helps you heal your mind. There's tons of stuff online about it. Start off going some 30 minutes guided meditations once a day. Just Google guided meditations and try a few till you find one you like. I'd give you a link but I'm on my phone. Your life is important, as important as anyone's, and it's worth fighting for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry for the late reply. In the naughties the German economy was sluggish so the ECB kept interest rates very low in order to stimulate it, but this was the opposite of what was needed in Ireland as we were booming and the low interest rates only stimulated the housing market further.

By 'sacrificial lamb' I'm referring to the ECB threatening to cut off emergency funding to the Irish government if we carried out the haircut on bondholders we were planning to. This forced the government to pay 100% back of bank bonds covered in the guarantee. Most of these bonds were held by German and French backs so they were effectively bailed out at the expense of the Irish people at the behest of the ECB. </TEXT>

We conceded too much of our sovereignty to Brussels and ECB in adopting it. It contributed to boom and Europe made us the sacrificial lamb in the bank crisis. It's mind boggling there's no discussion of it in Ireland.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have religious OCD too. I find it is important for me to remember God is love and He understands I have OCD, He forgives my thoughts and is eternally patience with my mistakes and failures. It helps me to trust that God is helping me through whatever I have to go through and is helping me heal. I think it is very important if you do believe to have a positive faith based on love and trust that God is unconditional love and not judging you but has compassion for your suffering.

<TEXT> She mentions 'the farcical rte coverage of the election', I was wondering what she meant specifically. One thing I noticed at the time was when Sinn Fein exposed that the govt. was 2 billion out in it's estimate of the fiscal space. The govt had counted one 2 billion figure twice. Rte just referred to it in passing 'Sinn Fein disputes it's (the govt.) figures' and that was pretty much it. Now this was a govt pitching it to the electorate as the party of fiscal responsibility and they got the estimates dramatically wrong. This should be a huge story as it undermines the govt entire argument for re election, but it was discovered by the wrong party. RTE didn't want to be seen taking Sinn Fein side even though it was correct, in this instance it was a matter of fact. I feel if it was Fianna Fail that had discovered the error there would have been a lot more play on it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not the action that his blaming on ocd, it's the never ending guilt and feeling of being a bad person that he's blaming on it. Correctly in my view, committing some minor sexual infraction just after puberty hits is completely normal and most people would have long forgotten about it but he's obsessed with it years later and it's crippling his life. That's not right, that's unhealthy. Try not be so judgemental, it won't help anyone. </TEXT>

Everyone else has to too, there's nobody alive who hasn't crossed a line or two in their time. Take care of yourself, have compassion for yourself in your suffering. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But slow is a euphemism for stupid. I agree excessive verbal contortions are ridiculous, but some language does need to be toned down to prevent it being used cruelly. He didn't ouch on at all the elephant in room, especially in America, race. He didn't dare try and justify the use of the word n*gger and there's a good reason for that. It's a word of hate, used as a weapon to dehumanize others. People are rightly condemned for using it. These days racists use the term 'political correctness' as a shield to hide behind, I'm looking at you Donald Trump, to protect them from what they see as unfair criticism. </TEXT>

It helped me heal the wound, perhaps it might help you. I think perfectionism is a big part of OCD, we want so bad to be morally perfect human beings that we torture ourselves over small infractions and obsess about the possibility of becoming some extreme example of moral depravity. Remind yourself it's okay to be imperfect, everybody is, it's a fundamental part of being human. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's good. But a friend of mine works in the civil service helping rural people find employment. He told me about a company called Job Path, who are a private English company that get contracted by the government to force people into employment. If you live in Kerry and are a waiter, they'll offer you a job gutting fish in Donegal and if you don't accept they'll threaten you with cutting your dole. They are a nasty crowd who only earn money if they get people off the dole, that's way things are headed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the info. I had a similar experience after inquiring into it I got a glossy brochure with a GP saying how TM could bring about world peace. Than it said the price was 1,500 (irish pounds at the time). I thought world peace is only for the rich I guess, but I've been practising different Buddhist methods for the past few years, very happily and quite cheaply.  :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I experience a lot of guilt as well primarily about breakdowns due to OCD and not living my life to the full and feeling not good enough.  I recovered from OCD once and then had a breakdown because I brought on a spike.  I felt endless guilt over that plus a fear of repeating the mistake. I read something that ended with you can choose to love and forgive yourself. So I wrote down everything about the episode and at the end wrote I choose to love and forgive myself for that. It helped a lot. Maybe you could do something similar with the episodes that haunt you? Also meditation gives me a lot of relief from ocd, I always promote it for that reason, here's a[ link](http://self-compassion.org/category/exercises/#guided-meditations) to some guided meditations, there's one of practising self compassion, which may be good for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with what you are saying, you make some very good points. I do still think my point stands that ministers in this government are making a point of personally distancing themselves from problems on which they have oversight. I don't doubt that O'Riordain was sincere in his speech today, but it says something to how we govern ourselves that those in power cannot vote on their principles and stay in power. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this is part of a bizarre and cynical trend with this government. They take personal positions in public against the results of their policies yet continue to support and implement those policies. Varadkar has been deploring the the trolley crisis since he became health minister, Kenny did the same this week, but when they had the chance to do something about it in the budget, they decided to give everyone a few quid instead in the hopes of buying the election. Beware of this stuff, talk is cheap.

It's easy money for the government, without the backlash that would come from raising a different tax.  Essentially it's preying on addicts because it's easy, which is a pretty unpleasant thing for anyone to do. </TEXT>

That means the vulture funds buying property for nothing a couple of years ago and flipping it back to Irish people in a few years time will pay no tax on the massive profits they make for doing virtually nothing.  Income tax is only a small area of tax revenue, the really rich make money on assets, that was part of his thesis, I believe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> After yesterday, I have a horrible anxiety that Harry Redknapp may have been right in calling us 'bang average.'  I think Benteke did get some service but no support.  There's no point knocking the ball up to him if there's no-one around for him to lay it off to. Very disappointed with Robert Firmino's contribution so far, he's made no impression whatsoever. Without Coutinho and, I hate to say it, Sterling to provide a bit of creative magic we were toothless. Also Milner and Can made little impression in attempting to control midfield while Lucas just fouled a few people, which was better than nothing, I suppose. Add to that a defence that seemed to have a collective anxiety when in possession of the ball and you've a pretty wretched performance.  Good is news Norwich is next and Coutinho will be back.  Firmino may in time adapt to the league and prove his worth and Benteke looks good, plus Sturridge is fit again, they could make a fearsome partnership. I know everyone is saying off with his head, but I'd argue to give Rodgers a little more time to get things right. </TEXT>

I've been through years of this stuff and I can honestly say I'm a better human being now than when I began.  Personally, I have found meditation the best antidote to the illness, I recommend you look into it. No-one here can tell you you what to do with your medication, we are not doctors, I just recommend you tell your doctor everything.  He may decide to change it based on what you tell or not, I don't know, he's the one that qualified to decide.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, I have ocd. I saw a ted talk or something that advised using loving/kindness meditation towards unwanted thoughts.  I've tried it out and it's helped a lot.  Basically, every time you hear a voice, say the mantra 'may you be happy, may you be well' to it. The more loving you are towards these fragmented parts of yourself, the less hostile they become towards you.  I've gotten deep into meditation and eastern philosophy since then and it's helped me a lot (I know we have very different illnesses, but I thought that tip may help you).

Life won't give up on you, all your wounds can heal.  You can resurrect your relationships, you just need to tell people what's going on with you.  It's amazing, but you'll find when you reach out, there's always someone there.  Don't give up, my friend, your life is precious and valuable in ways you can't see now, but will someday.

<TEXT> You'd be amazed at how many people feel like you, I often have.  Maybe it's not just you that's at fault but the world?  Nobody should be bullied and terrorized at school, it has obviously left lasting scars that you still have to deal with.

Also, I don't think anyone would feel fulfilled doing the shitty jobs you, me and millions of others have to do sometimes to make money.  That's not a reflection of your inadequacy but the crap capitalism throws at us.

This life has a lot more to offer than you have yet experienced. I believe you have talents and abilities you have not discovered yet.  One day they will come out.  But right now, I think you should concentrate on healing your depression and anxiety.  Whether that means counselling, medication, meditation, exercise or whatever else you can find that helps is up to you.  Don't give up on life, believe that a better day will come and keep putting one foot in front of the other.

Much love! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been using mindfulness as well and it's helped a lot but I still have bad days.  I tried something the other day I learned from Pema Chodron, I said to my fear 'come in and consume me.' Strangely, total non resistance made it disappear rather than get worse. Also, I try to let go of the idea of the future. Like I want to control to future to be sure everything going to be okay, but I can't control it so I say something like 'the future will be whatever it will be.' And it helps me let go of trying to control something that only exists as a fantasy in my mind at the moment.  Hope that helps a little. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is real life and it's difficult. I don't know if you have ocd or not, you need a medical professional to diagnose you.  One thing I've found to help break obsessional thinking is conscious breathing. When you have a obsession sparking thoughts, you acknowledge it as a triggering thought, you decide to give that thought no attention and you put your awareness on your breath.  I've found personally counting my breaths for 30 or so seconds helps me from getting distracted by thoughts again. Hope this helps some. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean people earning over 100,000 a year.  We have politicians on pensions higher than that.  I can't see how anyone really *needs* any more money over that point, the people who have more than enough can pay higher rate of tax to support the people who don't have enough.  Isn't that the Nordic model?  Part of what I like about UBI is it ensures everyone should have enough to meet their basic needs.  In my view nobody has enough unless everybody has enough.  Willie O'Dea of Fianna Fail, of all people, gave a [speech](http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/ireland/News/article1577140.ece) recently saying UBI would be part of their manifesto.  If it any other party it would be enough to make me vote for them.  But if they can propose, then surely the Social Democrats can too. </TEXT>

I would like to see drug policy reform along the lines of Portugal with safer drugs like marijuana and perhaps ecstasy legalized and taxed but advertising for them banned.

I would like to see public banks launch along the lines the Greens have proposed.  Banking needs to be reformed, we seem to have learned nothing from the crash.

Repeal the 8th (I see you already propose that).

Have a compassionate social policy i.e. the needs of those suffering most are prioritized.

I would like to see the richest pay a higher rate of tax. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I have this whole madness about whatever I imagine is going to happen will not happen, because (I rationalize) it's always something you don't expect.  So if I'm anticipating something nice and I imagine and believe it will happen, I suddenly catch myself and think 'now it's not going to happen, you've killed it.'  Also, I have a related terrible fear of tempting fate. Once when I was in a brief period of wellness, I was desperate for certainty so I thought 'nothing can go wrong with this.' That night I allowed myself think an ocd spike and it came back worse than ever.  Since then I have a fear of believing anything definite about the future, but of course my mind craves reassurance and certainty about it.  It's the rock and the hard place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with you. I have ocd for the last 16 years and it's not as easy as 'observe and accept' as some people say, when disturbing thoughts are firing at you 24/7.  I use tonglen meditation to help ease the fear I feel and conscious breathing to try and starve the disturbing thoughts of attention.  Managing an anxiety disorder is a difficult business and not as simple as some well intentioned people here are making out.

<TEXT> I have pure-O ocd, which is a type without the cleaning, check rituals familiar to most people when they think of ocd.  Those are symptoms, the illness is repetitive, obsessive fearful thoughts that you know are irrational but you can't switch off. I have a mixture of harm ocd and religious ocd, which means I obsess over violent and blasphemous thoughts.  I don't desire these thoughts, they repulse me, but the more you fight the more persistent they become.  I've learned a lot of techniques for managing the anxiety from Buddhism and have been on some meditation retreats which were very healing.  I have an addictive personality, driven by a desire to escape the suffering in my mind, so have had problems with drugs and alcohol in the past. I'm now very clean living, eat right, exercise, pray, meditate, write, take meds all to try and get better.  And I have gotten a lot better, thank God, but it's still hard sometimes.  I've just got to keep doing the right things and have faith it's all going to work out for the best.  Keep on keeping on, man. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Klopp is taking six months out, so if it's still shit by December we can make the switch (assuming he doesn't take another job).  One terrible result doesn't mean Rodger's a bad manager. We basically had no strike force this season, any manager would have struggled under such circumstances. People seem to have forgotten we almost (should have) won the title last year. I say give him one more year, let him fix the gaps in the squad in the summer and judge then. Next year is make or break. </TEXT>

You submit your images and blurb to them and if they like it you'll get picked for promotion, which cost 15 dollars for a month or 35 for three.  Then one of the reviewers was interested and did the review, I got five out five stars so it was a top pick, so I had the option to promote it as such for the same rates.  The reviewer also did an interview with me at no cost, which is [here](http://www.undergroundbookreviews.com/magazine/interview-with-john-horan-by-candi-sary) if you want a look. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to drink to cope with my obsessions (I wasn't diagnosed yet, I though I just had depression).  It helped relax me a bit, but the ocd was ten times worse in the morning, I would have to pop some xanax to get under control.  It became a vicious circle for me until I gave up drinking altogether.  Since then, I've been getting better, before that I was disintegrating. </TEXT>

I have a religious aspect to my ocd so believing in a loving God who understands my illness and supports me through it helps a lot.  A book that has helped me a lot is 'comfortable with uncertainty' by Pema Chodron, a buddhist nun.  The Buddhists have great technique for stilling the mind and helping you deal with anxiety. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just had a look at some of your posts, I get that you're 17 and maybe you don't realize how you come across sometimes.  But when you title a post 'does anyone here think Irish people are really ignorant when it comes to music,' you are going to get people's backs up, straight out the gate, you've called everyone ignorant.  Maybe everybody isn't into the music you like, hip hop is popular with your age group but less so with others.  Anyway, if you want to provoke a discussion I suggest you try a more neutral welcoming approach.  Like 'who here loves hip hip, or what else are you into.' </TEXT>

<TEXT> Persistence is key to getting through depression.  Try and do some little thing every day that makes you feel like you're making progress.  Treat getting better like your new job, dedicate yourself to it.  Never give up on the hope that you can get better, you can! and hope is like a life raft in a stormy sea. Look at the roots of your depression, what do you think is causing it?  What can you do to lead a happier, more meaningful life for yourself.  Feel free to take a trial and error approach to your life, do more of what makes you feel better, cut out or reduce what makes you feel worse.  Always play the long game in this, some things like exercise are hard in the short term but pay off well in the long one.  Other things like vices play off in the short term but can be disastrous in the long one.  Consider yourself a work in progress, you are building a new, better you, it's an oppourtunity to look hard at your life and learn and change, it can be a good thing if you make it so. </TEXT>

There's an exercise called tonglen where you breathe in your anxiety and out love. It's counter intuitive, we want to get rid of our anxiety, but flight or fight response only strengthens it, non judgemental acceptance of it eases it, I find. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Perhaps being overweight was just a physical manifestation of your feelings of inadequacy and self loathing.  You have solved the physical problem but the psychological problem remains.  It's time to take a different tack, it's clear no amount of weight loss is going to address your feelings about yourself.  Perhaps get some counseling it may help you to work out some issues and trace back to where this feelings began.  Also try to begin to learn to love yourself as you are, flaws and all.  If you can't love yourself with your perceived flaws you can't do it at all, as everybody has some.  Try to view yourself with compassion, the same compassion you would give to someone you love very dearly.  Give yourself credit for your positive characteristics.  You're at least as good as the next guy, give yourself a break. </TEXT>

Try to look upon yourself and all of your negative characteristics with compassion, the kind of compassion you would give to someone you love very dearly.  Everyone has negative characteristics, if you can forgive and accept this side of yourself, they will exert much less control over you.  Loving ourselves is a hard lesson but one we must learn if we are to be able to love at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Speaking as a Kerryman who's been living in Cork for ten, it's a great place to live.  People are warm and friendly, it's easy get know them and make friends.  Wilton is surburbia but has shopping centres and all that for convience.  I live near the city centre and there's a great vibe in there.  Easy to walk around, plenty of different types of pubs, clubs, cafes, a few theatres and cinemas.  I suggest joining clubs with your hobbies and interests to meet new people you have something common with.  You'll have a great time, they're good people here. </TEXT>

It's an emotive and lyrical song, which would suit us.  Maybe if Ireland is ever reunited, it could be choosen.  The tune is the Derry Air and the lyrics were actually written by an Englishman about his son that he lost, so it suits our mixed up history. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suspect the memorializing the heroic sacrifice of the soldiers that died in that war is a way of nullifying criticism of the war and the elites who engineered it.  They did die serving their country, but it's rarely said their lives were wasted in a futile war brought about by the hubris and stupidity of the ruling classes.  Really I feel there should be outrage at the loss of life in WW1, not carefully manicured sentimentality.  But maybe I'm alone in this, I don't know.

<TEXT> I'm Irish and a music lover and one time I refused to stand up for the national anthem played at the end of the night in a pub purely on the grounds of musical taste, I think it is a bad tune, it annoys me, we have much better and more emotive Irish songs that aren't a hymn to an ambush driven by military style drumming.  It's just a bad bloody song.  I don't think the people standing giving me dirty looks could intuit my reasoning but at least no-one said anything to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe I'm alone on this but I can't understand why Liverpool didn't/doesn't sign Begovic from Stoke.  The rumour was he was available for about ten million at the time they bought Mignolet.  I consider Begovic one of the top three premiership goalkeepers of the past few seasons along with Czech and De Gea.  The man is a machine.  He also makes saves you wouldn't expect a goalkeeper to make pretty regularly, like in one on one situations.  

The problem with Mignolet is his decision making and judgement.  He's always misjudging corners and flapping under them, also goes when he should stay and rarely makes a save you wouldn't expect, though his reflexes are top notch.  Not so sure how good Begovic is at commanding his area as I usually only watch stoke on MOTD, but I've rarely seen him make a mistake that lead to a goal.  Can't understand why he isn't more highly rated/sought after.  Maybe I should have a word with Brendan. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's a case of the straw that broke the camel's back.  People knew after the crash they were going to have to absorb a lot of pain in the coming budgets and did so with little complaint.  The tax burden on the average family has doubled since the crash.  People are pinned against a wall.  Then meter's started being installed outside people's houses, bringing home the reality of this new tax. There's a widespread suspicion it's set up to be privatized in a few years.  Either way people are convinced prices will rise and rise year after year if it gets off the ground. There is also a feeling that the rich are never targeted and aren't paying their fair share. Added to it is a stream of stories of the incompetence of Irish water and the excessive salaries paid to it's employees.  People have had enough, the torch paper has been light and the fire is going to burn down a lot politicians careers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have gone through similar obsessions to you.  I have found meditation exceptionally helpful in healing my mind.  The you can find lots of guided meditations online or on spotify, give it a try.  Also, if you have religious ocd, a positive healthy faith is important, believe in a God of love who understands your illness and protects you from it doing you real harm, God is more powerful than any fear.  Medication has also helped, but it is palliative rather than a solution.  Pm me if you want to talk more about it or you just need someone to listen, I'm happy to help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read something when I gave up drinking that helped me - Surrender is the only escape.  It's a Buddhist phrase.  When I was having a bad day, when I felt like shit, I would want to drink to change my mood.  When you can't drink what are supposed to do about this shitty situation/day/mood?  Accept it, it is the only way.  Once you allow those feelings in, instead of trying to escape or suppress them, they will stay around a while and then move on, like storm clouds in the sky.  It is a much healthier way to deal with difficult emotions, you work your way through them, it is healing.  It teaches you to come to terms with yourself and your life, you learn you can handle it, you don't need the escape of drinking.  Drinking is a crutch that cripples the walker. </TEXT>

I fantasized about death as an escape from my suffering, but I was too afraid of going to hell to ever do it (which I'm glad of).  I have ocd which manifests as an obseesive fear of evil, so I too have had 

failures of moral and ethical thinking

as well. I've seen Medusa and it turned my mind to stone.  What can I say?  In the end we have to forgive ourselves and try and be better than we were in the past.  Life is an amazing experience and it's a shame to waste it on misery and regret, we've got to figure out a way to enjoy life or die trying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't develop it until I was about 24.  I became depressed after partying hard for a few years, doing drugs and wasting my life.  I became completely disillusioned with myself, to the point where I didn't believe in the person I always felt myself to be until then.  A fear overtook me, if I wasn't who I thought I was, who was I?  Who was going to become now?  Was I going to become someone evil?  The feeling of depression made me think my soul was gone rotten.  I started reading the bible to learn how to live properly, but all I could see was condemnation and I became convinced I was going to hell.  A particular line where Jesus says something like 'you shouldn't even imagine being with your neighbour's wife because it's the same as doing it' (I'm paraphrasing) convinced me to think a sinful thought was the same as committing that sin.  I thought, ok, I must not think any sinful thoughts.  Which of course, sparked them off.  Everytime I had a violent thought I freaked out and tried to suppress it or pulverise that part of my mind.  All this just made the thoughts stronger and more persistent.  

I wonder if I done things differently, if I hadn't gotten so out of control, if I had got better help, if I hadn't read bible, would I have been ok?  I'm nearly forty now, it's been a very difficult 16 years, although I have gotten a lot better.  I also appreciate that OCD forced me to become a much person through all the changes I made to try and get better.  I hope to leave it behind, someday soon, I live in hope of getting better and leaving it behind. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Intrusive thoughts are normal, they only become a problem when we (ocd suffers) over react to them and try and supress them.  I think your hypocondria may have just moved from schizophrenia to OCD, so don't worry.  I've suffered bad trips in the past and they can be very disturbing, not so easy to get over it, it's like a traumatic experience.  For now just focus on relieving your anxiety.  A healthy diet and exercise help and meditation is really the best thing I know for it.  You can find guided meditations online to help you.  Best of luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's up to all of us to find a way to make our lives meaningful to us.  It's different for everyone.  For a while your girlfriend gave your life meaning, but the trouble with that is all your eggs are in one basket and if the relationship ends, as they do, you are left in your current situation.  Ask yourself, what would you like to do with your life if there was no obstacles?  What are you passionate about?  If you have something then set it as a goal and begin working towards making a reality.  If you can't think of anything, aside from getting back with your gf, make it your mission to find out what it is you love in this life.  Go explore, there are millions of things out there to try.  

Challenges are daunting but they can bring out the best in ourselves.  Try to seek out somethings that challenge you, you will get a great feeling of satisfaction from accomplishing something you weren't sure you could do, I think you are missing that in your life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll hazard a guess at what it could mean.  To dream you are being cheated on by your partner suggest a fear of not living up to the expectations of others.  Grandmothers represent nuturing and wisdom although seeing as you live with yours she obviously a big part of your life so you should ask what does she represent to me.  Shopping can mean trying to acquire the acceptence of others.  You spend too long shopping with your grandmother, so perhaps that suggest you lack self essteem and are trying to find it in the approval of authority figures such as you grandmother.  A car represents how you make progress in your life.  A child represents a part of you that is precious and pure that needs to be nurtured and protected.  So having found you have spent too looking seeking others approval you are determined to move forward as quickly as possible but in the process damage a part of you that is precious and needs to cherished.  So maybe you should focus on nurturing that child within yourself, even if you don't receive much encouragement from those whose approval you seek.  Does that make any sense to you? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I've found medication has helped dampen the anxiety quite a bit, you may want to discuss it with your doctor or a psychiatrist.  [This](http://www.self-compassion.org/guided-self-compassion-meditations-mp3.html) is a link to some guided meditations I do, I mostly do the loving kindness one, it focuses your mind on love instead of fear.  I also learned at zen retreat not to try and battle your ocd but to accept your fears with love and compassion.  Just say 'I accept I fear xyz' it helps you to have a less hostile relationship with what is, after all, part of your own mind. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your fear of being gay ocd is a form of pure ocd known as hocd, h standing for homosexuality.   There's no sense to them, you just fear lsoing your identity as a straight man.   I have pure-o too.  I found tonglen meditation is very good for reducing anxiety.  Also, if you can learn to lightly embrace the anxious part of your mind with love and direct the loving kindness meditation of 'may you be happy, may you be well' towards it, that's also very helpful.  I discovered this on a buddhist retreat.  It is counter productive to have a hostile, adversial relationship with your ocd, try to view it and yourself compassionately.  It is a part of your mind, try and love it and forgive it.  Don't engage it with counter arguments etc, the content of your ocd thought is immaterial, it is nonsense, the less you react to it, the less power you will give it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's really sad and awful this has happened you.  Remember this person is a bully and their only goal is to cause you pain.  They can taunt you but can't do much else to harm you.  You are not a peadophile or a bad person in any way, you just suffer from a painful mental illness, which they are exploiting for kicks.  It just shows they are the truly damaged and sick party in this.  Keep you head held high, it may be this person becomes another object of fear for you, try to remember they can't really do anything to you except play on your fears. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Meditation is good for creating some peace of mind.  Nofap and other such strategies are just making concessions to your ocd.  Every teenage boy watches a lot of porn and jerks off a lot, it's not your fault you have OCD, it just finds a way to make you more and more fearful.  Don't try to fight or negotiate with your fears, just try to think 'this thought makes me fearful and thank ok, I accept my fears.'  You fear what you are not, not what you are.  You, we, all have a problem with obsessive, irrational fear, just accepting that and letting go is helpful to allow your mind to move on to other things. </TEXT>

It's just human, life is messy sometimes, it doesn't always work by the rules we try to impose on it.  Give yourself a little slack.  I would suggest having a frank conversation with Dave, explain you've had some feelings towards him and are feeling confused and guilty and don't want to rush into anything.  See how he feels.  Communication is good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Try [these](http://www.self-compassion.org/guided-self-compassion-meditations-mp3.html) guided meditations on self compassion.  You can learn to yourself and then life again.  I've been where you are (though I suffer from OCD) and I've learned you can get better from times of hopeless and pain.  Try and do one thing, no matter how small, that makes you feel like you're making progress in life.  Treat recovering from depression as your mission now, there will be set backs but don't give up. Or give up but don't give up for long.  Have hope, believe you can get better, there is always a way to healing even if you can't see what that way is at the moment.  Aim for fulfilling your dreams, however big or small they may be.  This will make your life feel meaningful and important to you, people need that.  Never give up, you are much stronger than you realize, you can overcome this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suffer from ocd but I still related to what you said.  It is like you have an autonomous enemy within your own mind persecuting you.  I was recently at the Buddhist retreat and we practised loving/kindness medition towards the parts of our mind we reject or hate.  Basically you just say to that part of your mind 'may you be happy, may you well' over and over.  It has honestly given me more healing than 15 years of meds and I've reduced the amount of medication I need by about half.  It's about making friends with the parts of your mind you would rather not deal with, it really helps, you can't get rid of those parts of the psyche but if you can develop a less hostile relationship within them, it makes life a lot easier.  I hope this helps, [here](http://www.self-compassion.org/guided-self-compassion-meditations-mp3.html) is a link to some guided meditations if you want to try it out. </TEXT>

Learning to accept my ocd with love instead of fighting it or trying to destroy it has lessened the conflict in my mind a lot as well. Believing that God unerstands I have ocd (i have a religious aspect to my ocd) and forgives me my ocd thoughts was a big help too.   </TEXT>

It's not really her he needs to get over, it's the idealized person he believed her to be but she never was.  He allowed himself to invest all his dreams of what he could find in a partner in her, inevitably the relationship fell apart when reality intruded on the dream, but really the relationship could never work, because he never loved her for who she really was, only for who he wanted her to be.  He still misses the dream, because it was perfect, and for a moment he really believed he had it and it was beautiful. </TEXT>

I don't know what happened him at Chelsea, I read a rumour about a degenerative knee injury, certainly he didn't seem to have the same pace anymore, and he was sold at the last minute of the transfer window so Chelsea weren't able to do a thorough medical.  We did pretty well oput of the deal, got Saurez and Carroll for the price, although the last one was ill judged. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [This](http://www.thebestshop.eu/shop/6-electronic-cigarettes-starter-kits) is a good site to get stuff on.  You need two batteries, a charger, an atomiser and some spare wicks.  Then you need some liquid, strongest strength is 24ml and they come in all different flavours.  I went from 25g of tobacco a day to nada on them, they've changed my life, much healthier and much, much cheaper.  Starting out to get all the kit is expensive but after that maintainence is quite cheap. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've had OCD for 15 years.  Recently I went on a buddhist retreat and I found the meditation practices very healing for me.  One which is good for dealing with suffering is [Tong Len](http://www.dharmaseed.org/talks/?search=tong+len+guided+meditation sort=-rec_date page_items=10), there are few guided meditations in that link.  Aso practicing loving kindness is great for creating a sense of love in the mind which relieves some of the fear and can rewire the mind somewhat with practise, here's a [link](http://www.self-compassion.org/guided-self-compassion-meditations-mp3.html) to some.  Also Jeffrey Schwartz's book [Brain Lock](http://www.amazon.com/Brain-Lock-Yourself-Obsessive-Compulsive-Behavior/dp/0060987111) is a good book for your wife to read, he is the foremost psychiatrist on ocd and the book gives strategies to deal with it and lessen it's impact.  Cognitive behaviour therapy is supposed to be very good though I haven't tried it myself.  Good luck with this, it's a very difficult illness to cope with, your wife is lucky you care enough to research it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You need to begin to view yourself with compassion, as if you were a dear friend of yours.  'We deserve compassion not because we are perfect but because we are suffering.'  I recently did a course on self compassion at a zen centre in Ireland.  It was very helpful in teaching me to accept myself flaws and all.  [Here's](http://www.self-compassion.org/guided-self-compassion-meditations-mp3.html) a link to some guided meditations we were sent as a follow up.  It's a difficult journey to make to learn to love yourself but it is one of the most rewarding possible.  Pm me if you want to talk more about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess quitting alcohol.  I had always been a heavy drinker, but after my sister died, I was grieving her and self medicating ocd and depression.  I drank every night for two years, I felt I was circling the drain in life, I felt I was powerless to stop it.  I didn't see drinking as part of the problem, I saw alcohol as helping me deal with my problems.  Denial, I guess, classic case.  I asked God to send me inspiration and always saw myself as a seeker of truth, but I didn't want to face the truth I was an alcoholic.  The day it finally dawned on me I got down on my knees and vowed not to drink for three years.  That was about 8 1/2 years ago, I haven't drank since.  It saved my life, saved my soul.  My life has been improving ever since, my depression's gone and my ocd has nearly gone.  If I'd known being sober was so much better than drinking I would have given up sooner.  Sometimes your crutch can become a ball and chain.  I thank God for saving me, really. </TEXT>

No, it's not. I think you are an enlightened human being.  If the compassion, understanding and love you've shown was commonplace, we'd be living in a much better would.  I think you father is proud of you from on high.  Love is all we have, the only thing that counts, God bless you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I posted this comment to the article. Here as well  

I don't thing a return to shame as a means of societal control is something Ireland should indulge in.  I remember that Ireland, it was horrible.  Not only were suicides, unmarried mothers, anyone different shamed, their whole families bore the shame as well.  You would only place a further burden on the survivors, who were seen as somehow having failed as parents/partners if their loved one committed suicide.  Also it would silence the suicidal and prevent them from reaching out and speaking to someone.  Real suicide prevention will come from people supporting and caring for each other, and those enduring the worst feeling it is acceptable for them to admit they need help.  Heaping shame on them will not help them, neither will it help the dead. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know how you feel, I've got a past that led to bad consequences for me and I find it hard to escape it's pull.  Try and view yourself with compassion, all your friends and everyone you know was young once too and they weren't perfect either, why should you be any different?  All we can do is learn from our past mistakes, and so not repeat them, there is redemption in that, you've learnt and grown as a person.  Some people never learn, put the responsibility on other and so never grow.  The secret truth of this life is no-one really knows what they're doing and is making it up as they go along.  Always try to learn the lesson and grow, that's redemption, just forgive yourself then and let it go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I became an alcoholic self medicating (at the time) undiagnosed ocd.  I used drink 6 cans most nights, I found it easier to cope with my thoughts half drunk.  But I found in the morning my ocd would be through the roof until I popped some tablets to calm them.  Eventually I quit drinking and got diagnosed and that's when I started to slowly get better.  I found regular drinking as a method took me daily a step deeper into the abyss.  Each day sober has been a step out.  If I could reccommed anything outside of proper medication it would be meditation. This [site](http://www.therealbuddha.com/meditation/about/) is an introduction to it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You've learned to love with your whole heart and that is beautiful.  To be honest, I think I've forgotten how to do that in my nearly 40 years in this planet.  Don't panic about soulmates or the one.  I've thought everyone I was into was the one until the concept became ridiculous to me.  If it's meant to be, you'll both find a way.  If not, you've had an amazing experience and to quote a tv show 'just because the rose died on the vine, doesn't mean it lied to you while it was in bloom.'  A broken heart is the risk we take when we fall in love, you can survive it, almost everyone you know has been through it, it is hard, especially the first few times, but it's always hard.  Don't let the pain close your heart again, try to keep open, not just to lovers but to all people.  You sound like a great kid, and all this passion you have discovered can give meaning and depth to your life, without it knowledge and play are empty and shallow.  Loving and learning are what life is all about.  Good luck out there! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with you, although I might watch the film again because I haven't fully made up my mind on it.  I think there's some great ingredients, Carey Mulligan is fantastic, it's looks great and it works as a portrait of a time and a place and a particular scene that would go on to be very important to America.  But the total lack of narractive or a character arc make it feel like a load of interesting bits strung together but don't really amount to very much.  I talking to someone who said she read the Coens added the cat to provide a narrative to hang the scenes together, which is pretty sketchy.  I don't know, I really wanted to love this film, but now I feel pretty meh about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think perhaps you could give your girlfriends the benefit of the doubt, they might suprise you by being supportive.  It's important you reach out for help, it's good you have made a start here.  This boy has treated you badly, I think you are entitled to an explanation from him, maybe he has a genuine reason for missing your date.  If not, it would give you an oppourtunity to express your hurt which can be cathartic.  I'm guessing from your post you are a young girl, from an old guy I can tell you we all get hurt in love, and we learn lessons about how we want to be treated and what acceptable or not by going through experiences like this.  You've been let down badly, but not every guy will be like this.  Also, please don't pin all your hopes of happiness on the right boy coming along, develop your own life and interests as much as you can.

<TEXT> Advent

We have tested and tasted too much, lover-

Through a chink too wide there comes in no wonder.

But here in the Advent-darkened room

Where the dry black bread and the sugarless tea

Of penance will charm back the luxury

Of a child's soul, we'll return to Doom

The knowledge we stole but could not use.



And the newness that was in every stale thing

When we looked at it as children: the spirit-shocking

Wonder in a black slanting Ulster hill

Or the prophetic astonishment in the tedious talking

Of an old fool will awake for us and bring

You and me to the yard gate to watch the whins

And the bog-holes, cart-tracks, old stables where Time begins.


O after Christmas we'll have no need to go searching

For the difference that sets an old phrase burning-

We'll hear it in the whispered argument of a churning

Or in the streets where the village boys are lurching.

And we'll hear it among decent men too

Who barrow dung in gardens under trees,

Wherever life pours ordinary plenty.

Won't we be rich, my love and I, and

God we shall not ask for reason's payment,

The why of heart-breaking strangeness in dreeping hedges

Nor analyse God's breath in common statement.

We have thrown into the dust-bin the clay-minted wages

Of pleasure, knowledge and the conscious hour-

And Christ comes with a January flower. </TEXT>

It helped me get through books I would have otherwise given up on.  I feel out of the habit unfortunately, but am trying to take it up again.

<TEXT> I thought it was one for the few films to deal with the financial crisis well and expose the corrupt heart of rampant capitalism.  Cate Blanchett's performance is unbelieveable, though the character owes a massive debt to Blanche DuBois, and Allen is clearly more comfortable writing priviliged characters than poor ones, which were a cartoonish, but that aside, a brave and important film.  One about the world we live in now rather than superhero escapism hollywood spoonfeeds us everyday. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **No help for that** - *a poem by Charles Bukowski I saw today that I thought was relevant -

There is a place in the heart that will never be filled


a space


and even during 

the best moments

and

the greatest times

we will know it


we will know it more than ever

There is a place in the heart that will never be filled

and

we will wait

and wait

<TEXT> Hey, you are not a pedophile, you are suffering from OCD, pure and simple.  Have you read Jeff Scwhartz's book Brian lock?  One of the things I took from it is when you have an OCD thought, instead of being drawn into it, say 'it's not me, it's my OCD.'  Your OCD is telling you you're a pedophile but it is and will always be a liar.  Have you got any treatment for OCD, medication can lessen it quite a bit.  Also meditation is a great way to create some calm in your mind and lessen anxiety.  Please get as much help as you can for yourself, I know it is a very hard battle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is just a guess but I'm going to give analyzing you a go.  Maybe deep down you don't love yourself, in fact you hate yourself and are convinced you are not worthy of a good person's love.  You fear one day he is going to see you for the horrible person you think you really are and then leave you, which would be devastating.  The only defense you think you have against this scenario happening is to sabotage the relationship so he gets hurt first and you get hurt less.  Fear and self loathing.  If this is the case then you need to seek counselling to trash it all out.  But obviously you would need to try to begin to love yourself.  The key to this to begin to view yourself with compassion, the same compassion you would give someone you love deeply.  Take note of all the good points you have, all the times you are loving and understanding and kind and you can begin to change your view of yourself.  Hope this helps! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Being from Kerry, I never had much gra for hurling, I found it a frustrating game to watch on the old 21 inch square tvs of old as I could never see the ball it was hard to follow what was going on.  But this year i watched the finals in hd on a 42 inch screen and suddenly it's the best sport ever to watch, you can really see the skill and subtleties of the game.  I think the new tvs revolutionize hurling as a spectacle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Grief is the sudden absence of someone you loved from your life.  You are both experiencing that.  Perhaps this desire you are feeling is really a displaced desire to fill the hole that has opened up inside of you, and who better than someone who understands deeply, who has the same gap inside them.  So maybe you unconsciously see her as a quick fix for your grief.  But there are no quick fixes, you must go through your grief, experience it fully in order to heal.  Running away from it will only  prolong the suffering. </TEXT>

<TEXT> bad stuff happens in this world, in this life.When you think about it, you, me, everyone around is going to die.  That's the way it's always been.  I don't think that's prove of the absence of God.  I think a lot of people use the idea of God to cope with the bad stuff, especially our own death.   Birth and death are simple the basic facts of our existence on this plane.  That's the way it is whether there is a God or not, whether you believe there's a God or not.  I do believe there is one, I feel sure in it.  If you think about it, we live in a universe which has produced consciousness, which implies consciousness in somehow inherent in the fabric of the universe.  It doesn't compute to me that consciousness could grow out of particles and chemistry as just some kind of miraculous happenstance.  Now you have consciousness, this life, it's what you are going to do with it that's important.  People are doing bad things in the world, yes, what are you going to do in it?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry you've had such a difficult time in life.  I don't think people, especially your family would get over losing you to suicide, that kind of wound never heals.  I think you are just rationalizing to make it seem more acceptable to yourself.  Have you ever tried meditation or cognitive behaviour therapy?  They can help a lot.  These [1](http://www.ananda.org/meditation/learn-to-meditate/) [2](https://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome) sites are an introduction. I believe people can change and their minds can change over time.  You will not be the same person in five years that you are now.  If you keep trying to get better, I believe you will, you will find out what works for you and what helps to reduce fear and increase wellbeing.  I think a lot of your efforts so far have been for other people, to make them think you are ok, to have the perfect mask.  I think it's time for you to work on helping yourself to get better at coping with life and shepherding your mind and moods.  You can learn this things, make it your mission in life to learn about yourself and your needs so that you can live a fulfilling and rewarding life, don't write yourself off as hopeless, you are not, you can change yourself and your life, you have the power within you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you are strong mentally to struggle with depression for so long.  It hasn't beaten you yet, don't give up and let it win.  It can never win without your permission. I know it has been so long since you've been happy it seems impossible to experience it again, but it's not, don't give up on yourself and your life, who knows what value you can add to the world in time.  Can I ask you, what do you think is the root cause of your depression?  If there was one thing you could do, what would it be? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, I have ocd which is incurable.  I have had it 15 years, at times it was a very dark road.  But by doing the right things, getting help, medication, meditation, exercise, counselling, following my dreams I have gotten much, much better.  There were many times over those years i thought there was no hope for me and I longed to die.  I couldn't have imagined how much better I have gotten and how much I enjoy life now.  I have learnt that it will amaze you what you can recover from and there is always hope, even when you can't see it, even when you don't believe in it, you can always get better.  Never give up on yourself, you are worth seeing this life out all the way, one thing I promise, it will surprise you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's understandable to hate yourself as a teenager, I did for a long time as well.  It is a way of rejecting a painful world.  Adolescence is difficult for almost everyone, everyone has insecurities about how they look and what others think of them.  Suicide can seem like a solution but it isn't.  growing to love appreciate yourself is the solution.  It sounds simple, but it isn't easy.  When I was a teenager I hated the my weight and the size of my nose.  I thought if they were different, I could get girls and be more popular and cool.  But I guarantee the guys and girls you see as the most popular have two or three things they hate about themselves and wish they could change.  Learning to accept yourself as you are is part of the journey of being human.  Try to view yourself with the same compassion and understanding you would give a close friend.  No-one is perfect, we don't demand it from others so we shouldn't from ourselves.  Try and appreciate your good points.  If feeling suicidal persists maybe see a counselor or a therapist.  In the meantime [here'](https://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome)s a website that introduces cognitive behaviour therapy, which helps you be aware of how you think about yourself. </TEXT>

Get help, be willing to learn.  Adopt a trial and error approach to life, habits or action that prove destructive in the long term cut them out.

<TEXT> I feel Cheyenne is a character who got frozen in the role of the rebel when was 15 and was rejected by his father.  The whole film is his journey to come to terms with his dad.  The message of him appearing as a normal adult at the end is, I think, the completion of his quest to first understand and then forgive his father, thus freeing him from the role his father had inadvertently cast him.  He has finally become an adult.  Just my theory. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find it a cause for the despair that almost all the answers to this question refer to the size of the economy as the key indicator of America's health as a nation.  It is symptomatic of what has happened under neo-liberalism that has grown since the time of Regan. This in itself is a sign of it's decline, the markets are our gods now, we must sacrifice the future of our children to appease them. 

Morally America has declined.  Habeus corpus is now optional, people are assumed guilty. Once the totem of human rights, America has become a nation that tortures prisoners, prisoners who are not convicted of any crime.  

The media and public discourse have declined to infantile levels of name calling and arguments that by rights, should make an adult blush to make.  

America has failed to lead the world in the greatest challenge facing the world, climate change.  Science is not regarded as the unbiased harbringer of truth anymore, if the facts don't suit, they are distorted and dismissed.

Education is poor, an uneducated populace is easier to control and easier to fool.

Corporations are people, legally.  But far more powerful people than anyone else.  Almost no-one gets elected unless they are corporation funded, meaning politicians must serve their paymasters first and the people second.

America has the highest prison population in the world.  The land of the free?  Really?

Unions are broken and marginalized, people have very little power aside from their vote, but then can only vote for corporate approved candiates.  The media is almost run by the corporations.

Socialism for banks, too big to fail, too big to jail.  One law for the rich, one for everyone else.

America will spend endless money on wars and almost nothing on the poor, it's the definition of anti christian values.  Most Hardcore American Christian's support this.

America kills by drones.  People are murdered by remote control, including high numbers of civilians and no-one cares.  Imagine if another country was killing Americans in the US using drones, how would you feel about that?

America supports Israel unreservedly, no matter how badly they abuse the human rights of Palestinians.  

Congress is brazenly defying the will of the American people.

America is a great country and I hope it can find it's way, I am not anti American, but I believe you must face your problems in order to conquer them. </TEXT>

Feeling like a burden is common for depressed people, but it is always an exaggerating guilt feeling.  The true burden would be the feeling of loss and confusion you would leave your family with if you committed suicide.  You have beauty and life in you, you deserve to let it shine.  Have you tried meditation?  It can help you grow positive feelings within you and let go of negative ones.  I really suggest you talk to your psychiatrist and family again.  They need to know how troubled you feel, you are loved, don't doubt it, and people do want to help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> By changing yourself you change the world because you are a part of it.  Apathy and cynicism arise from thinking one person cannot make a difference, but it is this idea that is the biggest obstacle to people creating change.  'You must be the change you want to see in the world' - Gandhi.   

Would your suicide change the world?  Yes and for the worse. Suicide spread out pain and trauma through families and communities.  Not only that but we would lose all the positive things you could have done in your life.  It could be just you loving some people.  Love sustains us all, and is reason enough to keep going.  The more love and care and kindness you put into the world the better it will be.

<TEXT> Well, I think eliciting sympathy from someone is akind of quick way to feel someone's love.  I used do it as well when I was a teenager.  It is understandable you did that because you needed to feel love so badly, when your parent was so critical and seemingly unloving.  Your mother probably isn't conscious of how negative she is or how badly it affects you.  I think you are a conscientious person who cares very much what their loved ones think of them and are frightened of earning disapproval from Krista when that already all you get from the other most important person in your life, your mother.  But you feel guiltly for exaggerating.  I think you are being too hard on yourself, we all make mistakes and we need to learn to forgive ourselves if are to be able to cope with life.  Try to view what you did from a compassionate understanding standpoint.  You were young and very vulnerable, you did it with no malice or desire to hurt and anyone, you did it purely out of a desire to be loved.  It is completely understandable.  You have learned from this, that ist is a destructive thing to do even if you didn't mean any harm, so I'm sure you won't do anything like it again.  Give yourself credit for having lived and learned, that's all any of us can do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, you don't necessarily have to tell anyone straight off the bat that you are suicidal.  You can just say you are finding really difficult to cope with life right now and feel you need some help.  I think people can understand that.  Tell what do you think has lead to you to this point in you're life where you feeling this way? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you could benefit from talking to your sister.  There is help available to us, but it takes courage sometimes to reach out.  DOn't feel guilty about it, it is likely there will come a time when you feel strong and she feels week and you will able to return the favour.  Is there any counselling available to you in your school or in your area?  Counselling can be very helpful.  Would your parents be willing to pay if you explained you needed someone to talk to?  How is your relationship with them?  

Anyway, it's nice to meet you, Christina, I'm John. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, mod here, I salute your good intentions, but we don't allow people to solicit private messages on Sw. The reason being that people quickly get in over their head and have no back up to assist them.  At least once a week we get a message from someone who has been trying to counsel someone privately and that person has threatened to commit suicide and gone offline.  This is very distressing for the person who was just trying to be of help.   The right way to help to engage people on the threads, offer supportive and encouraging comments.  The onus will not be all on you.  I hope you understand, I need to keep this post off the sub, for your sake. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Despite chronic depression and constant suicidal thoughts when it came down to doing it I found there was this unbreakable will to live within me.  It reminds me of this quote from Albert Camus - in the very depths of winter I found there lay within me an invincible summer.  I struggled against depression for a long time, but it's been worth the struggle, I have become strong, stronger than I ever thought I could be.  I've found new life and happiness, I made it by fighting my way through.  You can do it too, anyone can do it, depression is a part of your mind, you are the master of your mind, it is not yours.  You can learn, but you must fight for your life.  Never give up, never surrender. </TEXT>

Now is a time for you to focus on getting yourself better, your marriage and relationship with your parent will need to take a backseat to that for a while.  It's okay to concentrate on looking after you for a while, you desperately need care, from yourself most of all.  Practicing meditation will give you a new coping mechanism which should help you.

<TEXT> It seems suicide is an escape fantasy for you when you feel under stress or pressure.  The next time you find yourself having suicidal thoughts remind yourself of that, it is just a reaction to stress, you don't really want to die, you just feel pressured.  Remember that the situation will pass and tell yourself that you can handle it, as you always have before.  Don't beat yourself up, you are not really that suicidal, it's just a coping mechanism you develop when you were younger.  Try and develop new coping mechanisms to replace it. </TEXT>

We will do everything we can to stop this and close the accounts, but because of the nature of reddit, it is hard to fight this kind of trolling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used do the same thing for years. Now I'm an alcoholic.  I found the alcohol helped me cope while i was drinking but my symptoms were much worse the next morning.  So then I would take xanax till i could start drinking again.   Every day mental health got a little bit worse.  In the end it was terrible and I found I was addicted to alcohol.  Since I gave up I found the process reverse and every day I got a little bit better.  Be careful, it's is a dangerous road you are going down.

I would reconsider therapy, I've had some terrible psychiatrist who didn't help at all, but also some good ones that did.  I'm now with a counsellor who is really helpful.  Don't give up on it, there are good and bad shrinks out there.  Also meditation and exercise is very helpful.   </TEXT>
