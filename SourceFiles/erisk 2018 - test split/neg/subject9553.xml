<TEXT> That is a great point. But under another provision in the bill, anytime police seize cash under $10K, they have to file charges (looks like within 60 days) or else they have to return the cash. And according to a report the article cited, "half of all cash forfeitures were under $1,324."

So while Utah's law is definitely messier than the conviction requirements in other states, it still should help end a lot of abuses.  </TEXT>

The article also goes into great detail over the fight to reform that state's forfeiture laws and cites cases of abuse (e.g. a prosecutor used forfeiture money to pay off student loans, while another lived in a seized drug house).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just off the top of my head, deregulating craft beer, the trucking indutrsy and airlines have turned out pretty well. Two editors of the libertarian magazine Reason delved into all three in greater detail in Part 2 of their *[Declaration of Independents.](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1586489380/reasonmagazineA/)*

And the *Forbes* article I submitted also linked to how regulations have stymied [home food businesses](http://www.forbes.com/sites/instituteforjustice/2014/09/22/texans-created-over-a-thousand-local-businesses-after-texas-eased-restrictions-on-selling-food-made-at-home/) and [many entrepreneurs (e.g. hair braiders)](http://www.forbes.com/sites/instituteforjustice/2015/01/29/hair-braiding-and-occupational-licensing/) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Article mentions a new report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Department of the Treasury and the Department of Labor that looks into licenses to work. Their report finds that occupational licenses raises prices for consumers and wages for licensed workers, but without any large improvements in quality or health and safety." The article also touches on some of the consequences of licensing (e.g. 21 states allow suspending or revoking a license if a worker defaults on student loans). </TEXT>
