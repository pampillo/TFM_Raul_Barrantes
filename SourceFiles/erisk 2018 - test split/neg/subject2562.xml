<TEXT> Have you considered booking a match break (hotel room + ticket) through Thomas Cook?

I recently travelled to the UK from Australia, and like you I had a small window of opportunity to catch a game. As luck would have it, that meant the City match. 

The membership ballot was my main official avenue for tickets, but I wouldn't know for sure if I'd succeeded until relatively soon before the game.

I ended up booking through Thomas Cook, and though it was certainly an expensive option for seats in the NW quadrant at OT, at least I could be certain I'd secured tickets.

Note they apparently don't let customers outside the EU book these tickets any more, but a friend was able to book from the UK on my behalf and use my name as the actual guest for the hotel room and ticket. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was a great experience, actually! The ground was soft enough to feel natural and the ball rolled true, which you can't say about most park grounds. It bounces a little higher in the field, but that's easy to get used to.

The only problem is, on a hot day the ground gets very, very hot. The rubber pellets used to bed the artificial turf absorb the heat from the sun and throw it right back at you. It can be sweaty work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My cricket club starts the season this weekend with a match on an entirely synthetic ground - that's outfield included, not just the pitch as we're used to here in Australia. It's something that happens far more often in the football codes.

Does anyone have experience playing on synthetic outfields? What should we expect? Any tips appreciated, as it's sure to be quite the change. </TEXT>
