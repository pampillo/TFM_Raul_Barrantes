<TEXT> If I read a book or want to read a book I have to buy it, I'm not a fan of using library's as I like to display a book before and after I finish reading it. I don't just want to give it back when I'm done

Its strange and I'm the only one i know like it.

Anyone else like this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys, I have just completed my very first script. It is a mockumentary called "The Pilot" where we follow a newbie show runner Charlie as he creates the Pilot.

Because this is my first script I would like feedback on all aspects. Thanks for any and all feedback.

P.s be super harsh.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am about a month into writing scripts and was wondering if this opening scene is a good opening for a pilot I'm working on. 

The idea behind the pilot is time travel, the main part will take place in 2018 but this opening is about getting access to the time machine in 2047.

Thanks for any feedback.

<TEXT> I never had any luck with girls up until this point. I was 14 or 15 and this girl and I where in scouts together. I had a huge crush on her, when we went on one of out scout camps i decided that this was going to be the time to ask her out, problem was I couldn't find the right moment. 

On the second day of the camp just after we had done a bunch of aquatic activities in the lake my friend and I decided we should get a shower. Now before i go any further the showers where set up weirdly, basically there was a boys and a girls shower room, each of the rooms had 4 cubicles. But the rooms where seperted by a thin wall with a gap at the top so we could hear everything the girls where saying. My friend and I where having out showers when we heard the girl i had a crush on talking to her friends, I said stuff it and asked her out then and there. All her friends heard and my friend just couldn't stop laughing. She said no, while her friends where giggling in the background. The rest of the camp was awkward. 

But 5 years later she is not dating one of my best friends and they still bring the story up every now and then so it ended fine.

I learnt never to ask a girl out in the shower </TEXT>

Im looking for a chronological list that tells me in what order to read all the comics and books in relation to the games.

So yeah is their a list of chronology for the modern day in games/book/comics? thanks </TEXT>

<TITLE> The movie cant fit into the games universe (Movie Spoilers) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-06 09:11:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So i just came back from seeing the movie and i think its pretty good, but in no way could it possibly fit into the main continuity of the games without some serious retcons or writing "we didnt mean what we said in the last movie" into the sequels. Here is a list of things i picked up on that directly go against what we know from the games.


First the most glaring thing, for some reason it seems abstergo hasnt ever seen an apple of Eden, when we know that to be false. 


They also seem to think that their is only one piece of Eden (the apple)


At the beginning of the movie they are not even sure the piece of Eden exists


And dont they already have the locations for all of the pieces of eden.


(now i could be wrong on this one) From the movie it seems that abstergo is only a small subset of the Templar order but from the games it seems abstergo is the whole Templar order


Their are many more small ones like the pronunciation of Alan Rikkins name.


on an unrelated note im pretty sure this movie confirmed that Callum is also a decedent of Arno

<TEXT> honestly even if they didnt really pull it off, the only way for the movie to have worked story wise was to have it be focused on the present day for the most part. The whole idea of the series is to stop the Templars in the modern day having little bits of that here and there in the game works but that wouldnt work in a movie as it would feel like there is no point to any of it. </TEXT>
