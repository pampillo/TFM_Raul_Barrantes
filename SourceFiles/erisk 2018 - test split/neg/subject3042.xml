<TEXT> I have so many questions.

Do they own the trees or did they just randomly tap a forest?

Does this harm/kill the trees or are they basically an infinite source for their business?

Could you drink the watery sap straight out of the tree?

Is the water they extract from it actually so clean that it is pure H2O? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is there any reason besides budget why European movies tend to favor longer takes, steady shots and wide angles, whereas Hollywood movies tend to have more cuts, more camera movement and more closeups? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I realize European movies have smaller budgets and more shots mean more setups, which translates to more expensive filming, but is that the only reason for this trend? I think European movies are often generalized as being slow-paced (boring?) art house because of the way they are shot. Is this a deliberate style that happens to also save money or is it more along the lines of working with what you got? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Halloween and Halloween 2 scared the living shit out of me as a kid and that feeling continues to this day. There's something about that creepy mask, those hollow eyes and the fact that Michael is relentless and unstoppable that I find terrifying. The way he slowly moves. He doesn't have to run after his victim, he'll get them eventually because there's no escaping him. Just the idea of seeing his silhouette at the end of the street is something that bugs me. Any other killer, you could just run away. But him? Nope. He's going to get you no matter what. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Despite the first movies great effort to bring the Guardians together and establish them as a team, in the sequel James Gunn decided to undue that by making everyone even more quarrelsome and splitting them into two plot lines. And ignoring the first films effectively simplistic story revolving around a central common goal and a MacGuffin, Vol. 2 seems to meander rather aimlessly in the first two acts and its not easy to summarize what the film was actually about. Not that multiple plot lines or a less streamlined structure are bad things, but neither seems quite appropriate for this type of movie nor is it executed in the best possible way. But its stilla very entertaining film with many jokes (some forced, some genuinely funny), great visuals and even some depth (there is quite a lot of emotion and groundwork for characterization, though its often hard to take it seriously given the nature of the movie). Dave Bautista steals the show as Drax and Rooker stands out as the actor most capable of pulling off drama. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Out of those you mentioned, I only really find Lessons from the Screenplay to be genuinely insightful for me, because I don't read scripts and they often show and talk about the stage directions and other things I don't get to see in the movie from just the dialogues. Nerdwriter is utterly hit and miss and his tendency to stretch a single point, which could me summarized in a sentence, to a five minute video is maddening. I also find many of his points either very far fetched (or at least not entirely supported by the examples he gives) or very obvious. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unless you want to actually study cinema (in film school or by reading books on your own) a good way to get started is to watch movies with audio commentary from the director/writer and to watch making of documentaries. This way, you can get at least a general idea about the choices made during filming and the techniques used to achieve certain things. 

What I like to do is to pause a movie at some point (usually when there is a particularly beautiful or intriguing shot or a practical effect) and just think about all the things that had to happen and that had to be done to get what I'm seeing on screen. Like, pause Star Wars on a shot of R2D2 on Tatooine and think about what you see on screen and how it got there. The process of designing and creating the R2 prop, the actor inside, all the wires and stuff that's outside the frame, the whole huge production in a desert in Tunisia, the sound effects added in post that had to be created, how those were done, etc.

As for analyzing story, it's always good to also read a lot of books to really be aware of various storytelling techniques, tropes, etc. Also, as you watch a movie, start by analyzing it in a basic way. You don't have to find a huge hidden meaning on your first try. Start by dividing the movie into acts and look at how information is communicated to the audience, how the plot progresses, when there is rising action, what leads to a climax, etc. Try to think why a certain scene is in a movie and how it contributes to the story and what would happen if that scene was cut out of the movie. Would anything change? Would you have less information? Would characters have less information? 

I suppose the important thing is to have fun. I mostly analyze movies for myself. I'm not about try and compete with Lessons From The Screenplay or Every Frame A Painting (I don't even have video editing skills or a powerful enough computer to make a video essay like those guys) but there are always things I pick up on my own and things I discover in movies that make me appreciate the craft and understand the choices. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There were two reasons to rob graves and both of them don't apply anymore.

**1. Stealing bodies for research:** 
People would steal fresh bodies after the funeral and sell them to doctors for their research  or for teaching. And I don't mean Frankenstein-type weirdos, I mean respectable doctors and teaching hospitals that simply lacked cadavers to use in anatomy class. Nowadays this is no longer a problem since a) we need less cadavers to study because we already know the human body, and b) donating bodies for scientific purposes is a thing now.

**2. Stealing valuables from graves:** 
People used to get buried with all sorts of valuables like jewelry. This is no longer a common practice and even it it were, people in general are way more rich than they used to be, so it's easier to rob a random person in the street than to dig up a body hoping to find something which might not even be there.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  If you bomb a factory it might take a few months to rebuild the buildings but most of the machinery and tooling would survive.

I find this very hard to believe. Do you have a source for claiming that machinery within bombed factories was intact?

 So the destruction done to the industry were only temporary and could be fixed. 

Most of that fixing requires enormous resources, though (manpower, machines, material) which must have all been in very short supply. So any sort of rebuilding was strongly dependent on (and thus influenced by) support from the winning countries.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Brad Dourif is an amazing actor. His breakout in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is astounding and really owns any role he does. Grima in Two Towers is probably his biggest gig but he was super creepy in The X-Files, that is my favorite performance of his. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I just finished Season 2 of Voyager. Here are some of my thoughts on each episode </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-26 19:31:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I began watching Voyager and I decided to write down some short opinions on each episode. Since my write-up of [Season 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/60vrwc/i_started_watching_voyager_here_are_my_thoughts/) met with positive reaction, I am back with Season 2. It took me a while to finish it, but it was worth it. I'll be moving on to Season 3 immediately, but for now,  **please keep the comments spoiler-free for seasons 3-7.**


**201 - The 37's**

**Summary:** Voyager encounters a 1936 Ford pickup truck floating in space, which leads them to a planet where they find eight humans in suspended animation. One of them is Amelia Earhart.

**Opinion:** At first I thought this was going to be one of those episodes like TOS's Metamorphosis, where they found Zefram Cohrane to be still alive in remote space, or Requiem for Methuselah, where the guy appears to be multiple historical figures at once. But nope. This episode surprised me with an emotionally resonating idea of the crew giving up on home and settling a planet already inhabited by humans. It strongly reminded me of the time on Battlestar Galactica when they found New Caprica and the fleet divided into people who wanted to stay there and those who didn't. (You'll notice that I tend to invoke BSG from time to time in these write-ups, because the more I watch Trek the more I discover its influence on BSG.) It was fun watching Janeway meet Earhart, and it was a strong moment when Janeway told her she is the captain of a starship. It actually gave me a few goosebumps to think about the gravity of the first female pilot to cross the Atlantic meeting a woman from a future where not only is interstellar travel possible, but women are also equal to men. The episode went from average to great and overall I liked it quite a bit. Three things though: 1, So Voyager can just land on a planet? No big deal? Building a starship on Earth, as seen in the JJverse, suddenly seems less dumb. 2, Why did Earhart's navigator wear a suit and tie? Were they crossing the Atlantic so he could go to a job interview? 3. I can't believe they didn't show us those cities the humans built.


**202 - Initiations**

**Summary:** Chakotay's spirit ritual is interrupted when a young Kazon warrior attacks his shuttlecraft in an attempt to pass his initiation rite. But Chakotay destroys his ship and saves his life, causing the boy to loose face in their warrior culture.

**Opinion:** The Kazon are not my favorite villain. I don't understand why they are portrayed as a nomadic warrior tribe opposed to modern technology when they have huge spaceships and some advanced weaponry. You're either a Mongolian tribe or you're a space-faring civilization. Pick one. I also don't find them to be very internally consistent. One minute the leader talks about dying in battle and bravery vs cowardice, the next minute when Chakotay takes him hostage he suddenly orders everyone to stand down so he comes to no harm and Chakotay can escape. Uhm, what happened to dying in battle? With their warrior attitudes and bumpy brown foreheads, the Kazon seem like a poor knock-off version of the Klingons. Can you tell I didn't enjoy this episode very much? Also, couldn't they get another actor to play the young Kazon instead of Nog from DS9?


**203 - Projections**

**Summary:** The Doctor must question reality when he is summoned after a devastating attack on the ship but appears to be human while the rest of the crew are mere holograms

**Opinion:** I love these sort of mindfuck episodes where things are not what they seem. It reminded me of TNG's Remember Me, Frame of Mind or even Future Imperfect. And speaking of TNG, Broccoli is back! Not that I missed him, but he wasn't half as annoying in this episode as he used to be on the Enterprise. Anyway, it was a fun standalone episode that gave the doc stuff to do - for the first time this season. I only hope they will actually set up hologram projectors in different parts of the ship so he can leave sickbay irl and not just in this episode's fake reality. 


**204 - Elogium**

**Summary:** Voyager discovers a huge swarm of space insects and Kes has severe munchies that turn into early-onset puberty, which prompts her to consider conceiving a child with Neelix.

**Opinion:** "We need to start having babies," BSG's president Roslin exclaims. "But first let's ponder the implications," replies Janeway. Once again I was reminded of Galactica by this episode's overall theme of having children. Was this really the first time it occurred to anyone on the ship that the 70 year journey back home just *might* require them to procreate? Apparently so. In true Trek fashion, instead of sexing it up, they talk it up. The result is an odd episode that attempts to be funny and deep at the same time, mixing double entandre and comedic puberty with serious discussions of parenting and commitment. Not my favorite episode, but at least we got the second funniest line of the show, courtesy of Tuvok. "It appears we have lot our sex appeal, captain."


**205 - Non Sequitur**

**Summary:** Kim wakes up in San Francisco, having never gone on Voyager's faithful mission. He's in Starfleet R D working on a new runabout and he has a fiance. Confused about this alternate reality, he seeks out a drunk Paris, who also never boarded Voyager.

**Opinion:** I always enjoy these "specials" which are focused on just one character thrown into a weird time travel/alt reality/mirror universe scenario. After twenty episodes this also marks the first time Kim has anything interesting to do and is more than just a forgettable supporting character. Since he was featured so much in the pilot episode, I expected more from him. 


**206 - Twisted**

**Summary:** A mysterious region of space distorts the insides of Voyager, making several crew members lost in a maze of corridors and the doctors trapped in the holodeck.

**Opinion:** This was another one of those inconsequential filler episodes that could happen whenever, but it was fairly enjoyable and engaging. It reminded me of DS9's Move Along Home.

**207 - Parturition**

**Summary:** Paris  schools Kes in shuttle piloting and falls for her, making Neelix extremely jealous. When a conflict escalates between them, Janeway sends them down to a planet with a poisonous atmosphere where they hope to find food and Neelix decides to take care of a freshly hatched pterodactyl-like alien. Meanwhile, Voyager fights off a ship.

**Opinion:** This was definitely my least favorite episode so far. It had elements of DS9's The Ascent, but where that episode had a great questing beast dynamic between the wonderful Quark and Odo, here we have a forced love triangle between uninteresting characters who have little else to do, not to mention that ridiculous subplot with nursing the alien back to life. The other part of the episode that had Voyager face off against an alien ship felt extremely forced, as if they just had to give the rest of the cast something to do. The only intriguing part of the episode was the fact that they had to look for food supplies in order to survive - something they should have focused on more in-depth instead of doing the love triangle.


**208 - Persistence of Vision**

**Summary:** The doctor orders an overworked Janeway to relax on the holodeck, but she begins to hallucinate her holonovel's characters IRL and a sinister alien poses a threat to Voyagers when others begin to see things too.

**Opinion:** This was a pretty good "nothing is what it seems" type of episode. I like it when the writers use these sort of special circumstances, like hallucinations, to reveal new things about characters (such as that Torres wants to bang Chakotay). And Kes actually had something to do and her as yet poorly defined and underused psychic abilities came into play a bit. I'm curious to see if that ever gets properly developed. As a side not, this is the third time (I think) that Janeway's Victorian ghost story holonovel was interrupted by trouble - is this a running joke of the show?


**209 - Tattoo**

**Summary:** The search for fuel takes Voyager to a planet where Chakotay discovers markings from his Native American culture, which leads to an encounter with his ancestors.

**Opinion:** Flashbacks to Chakotay's youth (they picked a pretty bad actor, btw) show us he wasn't always the spiritual man and traditionalist he is today and while this episode wasn't particularly entertaining, at least it fleshed out the character. Also, apparently his tribe's Sky Spirits were actually ancient aliens who jump-started progress on Earth when they visited cavemen in the ice age. Who would've known.


**210 - Cold Fire**

**Summary:** After 10 months of wandering in the Delta Quadrant, Voyager finds a space station occupied by an Ocampa colony in contact with the dead Caretaker's counterpart, Suspiria. 

**Opinion:** This was an unexpected episode. At first I thought that after a couple of heavily standalone episodes they were finally going to deal with that whole stranded in the Delta Quad situation, but it turned out to be an episode focused mainly on Kes. She receives Jedi training Tuvok but is lured to the dark side by the Ocampan leader Tanis, who shows her the full potential of her dormant powers in order to.. what? Seduce her, I guess? He definitely wanted her for himself. There were some intriguing parts and that scene where Kes almost boiled Tuvok alive was badass. I got a couple of Event Horizon vibes from some of the scenes, like when the child caretaker had Torres and Tuvok suspended in the air and dripping blood on Janeway. Or when Suspiria turned into a purple tentacled blob. This wasn't half bad. More like this one, please.


**211 - Maneuvers**

**Summary:** Chakotay's traitorous ex from 110 is back, helping the Kazon to steal Starfleet technology and attack Voyager. Chakotay goes rogue to stop them.

**Opinion:** Unlike the more abstract and unnecessary episode Tattoo, this story centered on Chakotay was actually engaging and pretty close to that classic Trek rivalry with a recurring character. Not that Seska is as badass as Gul Dukat, as memorable as Khan, or as whimsically menacing as Q, but at least I have something to look forward to when she returns.... with in a fucking baby?? I did not see that coming. Hopefully the writers do something interesting with that.


**212 - Resistance**

**Summary:** An undercover away mission to procure fuel goes wrong when Tuvok and Torres are imprisoned and Janeway is injured and looked after by a crazy person who confuses her for his daughter.

**Opinion:** The cold open gave me some serious Star Wars vibes with the costumes, sets, and overall feel. It was like the crew visited a wretched hive of scum and villainy and got attacked by by helmeted troopers. The episode itself wasn't bad per se, but I had trouble connecting with it. The crazy dude who took care of Janeway thinking she is his daughter did nothing for me. I wasn't interested in the character and his craziness was kind of boring me. I often have trouble connecting with these one-off characters unless they somehow profoundly influence the core cast. I guess the emotional ending of the episode redeemed a bit but I'm not a fan. 


**213 - Prototype**

**Summary:** Torres gets emotionally invested in (and then abducted by) a broken down silver robot they found floating in space.

**Opinion:** Despite the robot's 1950s design and equally dated mask/costume, I really liked this episode. Data from TNG was name-dropped, issues with the Prime Directive were argued, themes of AI and its rights were discussed, and the episode focused on one of the main characters in an interesting way. Two thumbs up for a classic Trek story.


**214 - Alliances**

**Summary:** Voyager gets its ass kicked by the Kazon, prompting Chakotay and other Maquis crew members to lobby for a change of tactics. Janeway is reluctant to give up the Starfleet way of doing things but enters negotiations with the Kazon and their enemies, the Trabe.

**Opinion:** This might be my favorite episode of Voyager so far. There was a lot going on and all of it felt relevant. Although nothing really changed by the end of the episode, it didn't feel pointless and standalone. Just like I said about 116 in my season 1 write-up, this episode was exactly what the whole show should have been. There was a lot of tension between the Starfleet and Maquis crew members and the fact that Voyager is very far from home and kind of in a hopeless situation came across very clearly. I always enjoy instances when Starfleet officers struggle with whether or not they should follow their rules and directives and Janeway had a lot of that going on in Alliances. Also, Neelix was useful and relevant and not at all simply comic relief. My one beef with this episode is that Seska and Chakotay were kept completely apart and the fact that she impregnated herself using Chakotay's DNA wasn't mentioned at all despite that stuff happening 4 episodes ago. Instead, Seska makes a passing reference to her as yet invisible pregnancy when she mentions to Cullah that she is carrying *his* baby. What?


**215 - Threshold**

**Summary:** In order to speed up Voyager's return home, Tom Paris acts as test pilot for the first experimental flight to breach the transwarp barrier and achieve warp 10. However, the historic flight has unexpected (and potentially lethal) side effects.

**Opinion:** I already liked the episode when it had serious The Right Stuff vibes but then it suddenly turned into a combination of The Fly and Altered States and holy shit I did not see that coming! Not only does the crew perform some top notch sciencing and Paris becomes the Chuck Yeager of space when he reaches *infinite velocity* but then the episode takes a 180 turn into body horror territory and becomes straight up crazy, culminating in Janeway and Paris turned into *lizards in a swamp that just had baby lizards together.* I am genuinely curious what people think of this episode and how audiences originally reacted to it. This was.. uhm.. different. And awesome. But putting aside all that, I liked that this episode fleshed out Paris a bit and gave him a self-loathing inferiority complex. Also, and I did not expect this sort of continuity, the traitorous dude from the previous episode, who contacted Seska, gave the Kazon instructions how to achieve warp 10. I wonder if that will ever be mentioned again.


**216 - Meld**

**Summary:** Violent Betazoid engineering crewman Lon Suder murders someone for no reason and Tuvok performs the Vulcan mind meld on him to find out his motive. But the meld transplants Suder's violent nature onto Tuvok.

**Opinion:** I guess I'm in a streak of great episodes because this did not disappoint. I love Vulcan struggles with emotions and Tuvok really delivered. Great acting, great insight into the Vulcan mind and a great way to do something interesting with a character. Also, Brad Dourif! I find it kind of hard to accept that Lon Suder was somehow unseen until now, after something like 30 episodes. It makes little sense to do special guest stars like this on a show where new crew can't just show up out of nowhere when the ship is docked at a space station. But whatever. I hope we'll see more of him in future episodes, because from now on I will always keep in mind that no matter what dangerous thing is happening with the ship, somewhere inside there is Lon Suder brooding in his quarters under house arrest.


**217 - Dreadnought**

**Summary:** It turns out that a powerful Cardassian missile with AI that was reprogrammed for Maquis purposes by Torres was transported to the Delta Quadrant along with Voyager and is now headed to destroy an innocent planet unless Voyager can stop it.

**Opinion:** This episode had some intriguing ideas and it was another good Torres episode somewhat thematically similar to 213 (in that her creation turned into a force of destruction) but in the end it was kind of pointless. Given the nature of the show, it was completely obvious that Voyager would not be destroyed and the missile would be successfully stopped, so there was absolutely no tension during the final act, even though it was probably meant to be tense.


**218 - Death Wish**

**Summary:** Voyager accidentally frees a disgruntled and suicidal member of the Q continuum and a tribunal is held to determine whether or not he should be allowed to commit suicide.

**Opinion:** If I hear the word continuum one more time, I swear to God...
...I was never a big fan of anything related to Q and so I did not enjoy this episode one bit. Well, I guess I did enjoy seeing Riker again, and the actor playing the suicidal Q was pretty good, but other than that, I was glad when it was over. Here we have these two infinitely powerful beings and no one thinks to beg them on their knees to be sent back to the Alpha Quadrant? Q taunts Janeway with the prospect of returning to Earth (and having sex together, apparently) but that's about it. I guess that streak of good episodes is over now.


**219 - Lifesigns**

**Summary:** The doctors falls in love with a Vidiian woman dying of the Phage. Paris' recurring attitude problems get him in trouble.

**Opinion:** There's not much to say about the main storyline. It was charming but a bit boring and while I'm happy for the doc, I'd much rather watch stuff of more consequence. Like the traitorous informant who is till in contact with the Kazon. Or the fact that Seska craves Voyager and plans to attack it. And what about Paris? Starting with 216 there were instances where he was late on the bridge or had serious attitude problems, especially towards Chakotay, and now that culminated in him striking a superior officer and getting locked up in the brig. It's interesting that the show has these two serialized and recurring plotlines but chooses to be completely standalone in every other respect. I wonder what's in store next for Paris and that traitor dude.


**220 - Investigations**

**Summary:** Neelix becomes an investigative reporter and a disillusioned and demotivated Paris decides to leave the ship and try his luck elsewhere. Or does he?

**Opinion:** I really enjoyed this episode. But I do feel like it could have been much better. The twist was that Tom isn't actually leaving the ship. He's on an undercover mission to flush out Voyager's mole and his recurring insubordination of the past couple of episodes was all an act. That's great. Except I think the cover story was much closer to Paris' character than the heroism of the actual plan. As evidenced in 216, Paris is a guy who's been at odds all his life. He has trouble finding himself and finding a place where he would fit. He *should* feel demotivated and uneasy on Voyager. He *should* want to leave and take on the whole Delta Quadrant all by himself. He *should* do for real the things that were just a ruse. I never saw Paris as a self-sacrificing cookie-cutter hero but this episode definitely turned him into one. I think it would have been much more interesting if no one on the ship had any idea there is a mole, but Paris, having actually left to find his luck elsewhere, somehow finds out and decides to return to save Voyager when Seska attacks (which I assume is going to happen in the finale).


**221 - Deadlock**

**Summary:** While trying to avoid a fleet of the organ-stealing Vidiians, Voyager flies trough a spatial scission that creates an exact copy of the ship. One Voyager is doing fine while the other is on the brink of destruction.

**Opinion:** I found this episode to be reminiscent of TNG's Yesterday's Enterprise, a favorite of mine. It had some intriguing stuff going on, including the deaths of a newborn baby and the untimely and matter-of-fact demise of ensign Kim, which were both pretty dark for Trek. I also love the fact that everyone is terrified of the Vidiians. They are such a cool villain and frankly much more intriguing than the straightforward Kazon. Not only are the Vidiians fugly, they're after your organs! What a sick and terrifying prospect to be used as a lab rat in a leper colony. The meeting of two Janeways created intriguing dilemmas and I feel like it wasn't dealt with deeply and thoroughly enough. What a thought-provoking thing it is to sacrifice your dying ship so that your copy can survive. I also thought it was both amazing and very weird that they sent Kim and the baby from the soon to be destroyed version of the ship back to the version where they died. At the end of the episode Kim mentions that it feels weird because although everyone is exactly the same, they also aren't. Everyone he knew died and he returned to a ship where he also knows everyone, but their experiences are only 99.99% the same. He will be an alien, a visitor, a replacement. This was perhaps the first episode of Voyager that really left me thinking about it and contemplating what I just saw. 


**222 - Innocence**

**Summary:** Tuvok crash-lands on a habitable moon where discovers three children who claim to be in mortal danger. Meanwhile, Voyager makes contact with the race that inhabits the planet orbited by that moon, who are not pleased with Tuvok's involvement in their affairs.

**Opinion:** I guess I see what they were going for with this episode, but I can't say that I liked any of it. Tuvok's interactions with the kids were neither funny nor revealing of a new aspect of his character (I find the fact that he is a father intriguing and I think this episode did nothing particularly interesting with it). The whole story reminded me of a standard, rather mediocre OS episode, as if they found an unused spec script from the sixties and just adapted it to Voyager.


**223 - The Thaw**

**Summary:** The crew find three miners in asleep in stasis and plugged into a virtual reality where an AI is holding them hostage and feeding on their fear of clowns.

**Opinion:** Three guys in stasis. Ok, sure. They're plugged into the Matrix. Ok, cool. Kim and Torres are plugging into the Matrix to go save them. Ok, yeah, you got my interest, get the plot going already. The Matrix is filled with court jesters, acrobats, and Queen's Innuendo album art come to life. Ugh, really? And I thought the previous episode was reminiscent of the original series. I had great trouble finishing this episode and I consider it a waste of 45 minutes.


**224 - Tuvix**

**Summary:** Tuvok and Neelix are merged into a single person during a transporter malfunction caused by an orchid. The new being, Tuvix, starts a new life on Voyager much to Kes' dismay.

**Opinion:** At first I thought this was going to be another dumb episode. As if Neelix himself wasn't enough, Tuvix looked like something straight out of Red Dwarf and did not fit in visually with the rest of the show (though, granted, the make up job was really good). Also, I thought this was going to be a dumb comedic episode. But by the time the credits rolled, Tuvix actually became really interesting. I loved that he cried bloody murder when they took him off the bridge to be separated back into Tuvok and Neelix. They really were killing a sentient person (essentially a new form of life) and the moral dilemmas were great. I also loved the fact that the doctor refused to do it and Janeway had to be the one. Even Kes was interesting for once.


**225 - Resolutions**

**Summary:** Chakotay and Janeway are left to live out their lives in quarantine on a picturesque planet after they were infected with a virus from an insect bite. However, the crew have a hard time accepting Captain Tuvok's orders.

**Opinion:** What a good episode this was. Chakotay and Janeway had pretty good chemistry together and their inevitable romance was handled nicely. It also said a lot about their characters that Janeway refused to give up research while Chakotay was already having the time of his life in the great outdoors. Tuvok's command predictably didn't go all too well, especially when he vehemently followed Janeway's order not to ask the Vidiians for help. I expected there would be mutiny but in the end it wasn't so dramatic, and I guess that's for the better. Mutiny is really not in Starfleet's nature. But if other the previously displayed lack of continuity is any indication, Chakotay's and Janeway's experiences will not affect them in any way going forward and their brief affair will be forgotten.


**226 - Basics, Part I**

**Summary:** Seska uses her newborn baby as bait and lures Voyager into a perfectly planned trap. Meanwhile, Lon Suder wants to be helpful.

**Opinion:** Unlike the previous season's last episode, this was a proper finale and thank god I have Netflix and don't have to wait all summer for the conclusion. Seska's plan was really good and I loved the moment when the computer was unable to initiate the self-destruct sequence and Janeway realized why the Kazon targeted a specific, seemingly non-essential part of the ship. I also loved the fact that this was communicated to the audience purely by Janeway's expression and not some verbal explanation. I guess Suder and the doctor will save the ship all by themselves now. (One thing about the self-destruct: Janeway initiated it at least once before and since then I've been bothered that she is able to do so on her own. Should this be a command that needs consent of another officer?)

<TEXT> It wasn't literally a 4th wall break, but picture something like this: The movie is over, the big bad alien defeated, and then in the last minute of the film the characters learn that there are even bigger and badder aliens out in the universe and there's also an alliance of species devoted to fighting them and since humans were able to defeat this bad alien, they are going to spearhead the universe-wide effort, so everyone looks at each other and nods in a determined way and they go 'Yeah, we can do this in the sequel!' </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure if you're looking for an answer that names a specific person (a celebrity?) but I'm gonna tell you about my friend who is currently on the road to becoming socially normal.

For a long time my friend was reclusive and introverted to the point where I worried about him. This is a guy that used to be the life of the party in high school, but during college he developed something which I can only describe as a combination of depression and an inferiority complex. In addition to that, he did not feel at ease in social situations, he turned into a loner and he would not hang out with his friends if more than 4-5 people were going to be present (he would ask in advance what the expected attendance was and would leave if more people showed up). He became generally disillusioned with his life, owing to an inability to find a fulfilling job (he graduated environmental studies), an inability to find a girlfriend (he is still a virgin at 28 and tbh he is hopeless with women), his inability to break through with his band (he is singer/songwriter/lead guitarist of a rather unsuccessful but badass rock band), his self image of being unattractive (he is very skinny and has no muscles) and his growing dependence on weed and alcohol. However, thanks to some professional help and gradual baby steps in self-improvement, he is becoming socially normal again. He is now much happier than I remember him in at least 5 years and and it looks like he might even have a potential girlfriend lined up. He also gave up the substance abuse, which is the best news. </TEXT>

It is already a great movie full of intrigue, atmosphere and good drama and it features the always great Micheal Shannon and Jessica Chastain. But that ending. Holy shit. Not only does it simultaneously turn the whole movie on its head and leaves room for interpretation, but the score in those final moments is incredibly effective.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  This movie seems like it's aiming to have a little more depth

They did try to give the first movie some depth, too. IIRC especially in interviews during production the director and writer mentioned how they would depict this society where nobody cares about dinosaurs anymore because they became common. So you would have kids facebooking in front of a T-Rex enclosure and not giving a fuck about the marvel of nature and science roaring before them. I think it was supposed to be both social commentary and a reflection of the current audiences that are sort of fed up and bored with seeing CG dinos and monsters because, unlike the 1993 audience of the original movie, we've all seen that shit a hundred times already. The movie still had all these themes but I don't think they came across as anything deep. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw the first one and didn't care for it. Then 5 came out and everybody raved about it so much that I gave it a shot. I had no idea who the characters were, I thought the acting and script were terrible and I turned it off after about 30 minutes. It just isn't my thing. But hey, I respect everyone else's fandom.

<TEXT>  But even if the films are revolutionary, it doesn't mean they're made on a technical level equal to the modern day. That art form has evolved a lot on the technical level.

What do you mean by technical level? Citizen Kane was made by a master filmmaker whose technical proficiency cannot be disputed. Do you mean technology? Are old movies inferior to new movies because of technological progress that happened in the intervening years? By that logic, Mona Lisa is shit compared to a selfie.

I am looking for a Godzilla tee and so far I had little luck. I found some in Akihabara that looked like they were official Toho merch but I didn't like them very much (for some reason they decided to print the image on the lower part of the back side of the shirt). Can you please recommend a shop or at least a general location where I could find Godzilla or other kaiju shirts? Many thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Take away the baggage (and largely overblown controversy) of being a whitewashed remake of a beloved anime and you are left with a somewhat flawed movie that could have easily been better or equally easily much worse. Ghost in the Shell ends up being quite average. Not as good as Blade Runner, not as bad as Aeon Flux. The movies futuristic cities with holographic advertisements and sleek robotic designs (some of which were done practically courtesy of the great Weta Workshop) are all wonderful to look at despite some too dim lighting. But visuals alone cant carry the movie. Its not that the plot is really a problem, though. The story is not original, but it does carry enough intrigue and potential philosophy to be interesting and even deep. Its just that the execution is lacking. The films pace often feels sluggish and immobile, the dialogues dont really flow or sound like real conversations, and theres practically no reason to care about anybody (or anything) on screen.

<TEXT> Life is a welcome addition to the creature feature subgenre, but it has certain flaws that will prevent it from becoming anything more than that. The cast is very solid but the characters aren't compelling and actors of Gyllenhaal's and Fergusson's caliber are given very little to do other than shout into comm systems and be scared. There are also Prometheus levels of bad decisions and suspension of disbelief as the film's internal logic is inconsistent at best and nonexistent at worst. One sequence has a character trying to kill Calvin with a flamethrower, peppering everything around him with bursts of flames in complete disregard of what he might destroy in the process. A minute later, that same room's fire suppression system goes off from a single, much smaller flame, simply because it serves the plot at that point. Many scenes require the viewer to stop thinking and it's that particular brand of dumb writing that turns a potentially great movie into an average flick. It's only really elevated by the last five minutes, which display an intensity of survival and a darkness of tone that should have been present throughout.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  this is a completely fresh concept not tied to a preexisting American franchise (it's based on a French comic book)

Aren't you contracting yourself a bit? Either it's a fresh concept or it's based on a comic book. I don't see how you can have both. (Don't tell me "most people never even heard of the comic book" because you could say the exact same thing about Guardians, which is why I made that comparison in the first place. The only thing GotG had going for it compared to Valerian is that it had the Marvel label. But you could say this has the Besson label, which still attracts audiences to a certain degree.) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  James Gun is an incredibly talented director and a visionary for the Guardians series, which managed to make an amazing movie out of a group of comic book characters barely anyone had ever heard of. Luc Besson, as talented as he is, did make Fifth Element and Leon, but then went a strange direction with Lucy.

I don't understand why people keep bringing up Lucy as if that movie negates everything Besson did before it and makes him a hack forever onward. Gunn co-directed Movie 43 and his Slither was completely average, so let's not pretend that he's some genius, faultless director who outshines Besson because of Lucy (which actually wasn't half as bad as people on reddit make it out to be).

Also, let me briefly rant about Gunn being a visionary for GotG. First of all, that word completely lost its meaning a long time ago. Every other trailer has "from visionary director such and such" these days. And second, let's not pretend like GotG is solely Gunn's baby. I don't doubt that a lot of his sweat and tears went into the movie and it's obvious he is very passionate about the franchise, but don't think for a second that he had full control and called all the shots. GotG is not his vision. It's an adaptation of someone else's vision filtered through so many Marvel and Disney board room meetings that it would make your head spin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are a couple of things they could still do with the concept of toys coming to life. I've had a couple of ideas just off the top of my head. It's just that none of those ideas have any real emotional resonance, which I feel was already done extremely well in the first three movies. And none of those ideas really warrant a full length film.

So, for example, I guess they could explore 3D printing. They could have a lot of fun with that. The kid could design and print her own toys according to her imagination, or make accessories for the existing toy characters. Or the toys could even be doing all that on their own. I don't know, it could be fun and it would be relevant to our times.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not going to pretend that I won't watch the movie. Of course I will. Of course I want to see what they came up with. But I also really, really don't. 

People like to say that sequels/reboots ruin the original movie and usually that's total bullshit. Don't like the remake of Total Recall? Just don't watch it and stfu. But with Blade Runner it's different. Blade Runner has a core mystery that has kept audiences guessing for more than 30 years. Is Deckard a replicant or not? It depends on what version of the movie you watch and how you interpret it. This question is the lasting legacy of the movie. Yes, it was visually groundbreaking, but then again, so many movies were. It's the mystery that has kept everyone so interested. And the sequel ruins that. I don't even have to see the movie to have Blade Runner ruined. Just the fact that Ford is in it playing Deckard is enough to ruin the original for me. He's not a replicant. Thanks for answering that for me, Hollywood nostalgia machine.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I usually see only one 3D film a year and the past two years were Star Wars. I expect that trend to continue with episode 8. I think of 3D as a sort of carnivale ecperience. Like once a year I go all out, buy the most expensive movie ticket for 3D, the biggest popcorn, the biggest soda, and just go have fun. But that's an approach that only works if I do it seldom. The fun and novelty of 3D wears off quickly no matter how well it's done amd the price is too damn high.

I actually broke my once a year rule and saw Dr Strange in 3D, and I kind of regreted it. The presentation was not very good (too dim) and some of the visuals were so crazy that adding another dimension to them was distracting in that it was one more thing for the eye (brain) to process. </TEXT>

To think that the best scene, the one that everyone raved about the most, was just a last minute afterthought, is mindblowing to me. No one thought of showing Darth Vader in action during the entire process of preparing this movie? What were the writers of this movie thinking?

I was also taken aback by the part when Edwards discusses his process, where he just has cool scenes in his mind and then he has to link them together somehow. That's not storytelling. That's a fanboy with toys acting out some fantasies and then stitching them together with some plot. Pre-visualizations and action scenes dictating story. What is Hollywood doing?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't use the term politically correct strictly in the negative sense and it wasn't meant that way here.

 I do not think it's PC or politically correct to have a crew that reflects the diversity of the people watching the show.

Considering how many minorities watch mainstream TV and movies versus how those minorities are usually represented in said TV and movies, I think Trek is pretty fucking PC.

<TEXT>  I still find however that it had the weakest cast of characters mainly in Chakotay Kes and Kim

I enjoyed Chakotay so far, but Kes and Kim might as well not even be there. I think DS9 had the best characters. Or at least the best relationships between them. You could really feel the hatred, love, or friendship between people. The bromance of Chief and Bashir, obviously, is very memorable. But my favorite was the questing beast antagonism between Odo and Quark. Dax, my favorite character by far, had interesting friendships with various characters. She was Kira's bff girlfriend, but she was also one of the boys with Bashir and Chief and she had a completely separate friendship with Quark that the others weren't really in on. DS9 didn't even need a scifi plot. I could just watch banter between those characters for hours. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I started watching Voyager. Here are my thoughts on episodes of the first season </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-22 17:46:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I started watching Voyager, having previously watched TNG, TOS and DS9 (yes, in that order) and I decided to write down some short opinions on each episode. If this post gets any traction I'll do more for the next seasons I have yet to see. **(So please keep the comments spoiler-free for seasons 2-7)**

**101 - Caretaker**

**Summary:** Voyager is tasked with finding a missing Maquis ship but they are spirited away to the Delta Quadrant by a mysterious space station that is beaming energy to a desert planet. There the crew discover an underground civilization worshipping someone called the Caretaker. Stranded 70 000 light years away from home, the crew begin their adventures.

**Opinion:** This episode felt very much like TNG's Encounter at Farpoint, which is to say it was all set up and introductions wrapped into an uninteresting plot. Compared to DS9's darker and more oppressive visuals (Cardassian architecture is the worst) I welcomed the more clean an bright look of a Federation vessel. The underground civilization, filmed mostly on location, provided for some solid production values and overall I think the episode did a good job of setting up intrigue for later. I expect the merging of Voyager's crew with the Maquis rebels will provide some tension later on. The cast is a roster of PC-friendly characters (a black Vulcan, a female Captain, a Native American officer, an Asian ensign) an I look forward to finding out who will become my favorites.


**102 - Parallax**

**Summary:** Voyager tries to help a ship stuck in the event horizon of a picturesque singularity but they soon get into trouble of their own. Meanwhile, the open post of Chief of Engineering is a topic of hot debate between Janeway and Chakotay, who wants to promote the hot headed former Maquis Torres. And the doctor is shrinking.

**Opinion:** This episode represented what I think of as typical Star Trek in that it combined wondrous cosmic anomalies and temporal shenanigans with the intrigues of command and Starfleet loyalty. It also helped to flesh out some characters, especially Lt. Torres. A standout negative of this fairly enjoyable episode was a very obvious infodump by Neelix, who literally took Kes aside to explain to her in a pretty childish way what a singularity is. I don't remember Trek ever resorting to such obvious explanations instead of assuming that the audience is well versed in such cosmic matters (though I might just be forgetting other such instances from the previous shows).


**103 - Time and Again**

**Summary:** Voyager investigates a planet destroyed by a recent explosion of polaric energy. A subspace fracture takes Janeway and Paris back in time to a day before the explosion, where they find the planet's peaceful occupants battling their government's use of polaric energy. Meanwhile, Kes begins to flex her dormant psychic powers.

**Opinion:** Perhaps this episode was meant to be an allegory to nuclear energy and its dangers, but I don't think this angle was conveyed successfully. However, it was another fairly typical Trek scenario with time travel and trying to stop a disaster and I enjoyed that quite a bit. Exterior shots on locations were also much appreciated as it gave the production values of this episode a nice esthetic boost. It was also the first episode where Kes had anything to do, which was nice.


**104 - Phage**

**Summary:** Searching for deposits of dilithium crystals to fuel the ship, the crew instead encounter a species of organ harvesters who steal Neelix's lungs. As Voyager pursues their ship, the doctor attempts to keep Neelix alive.

**Opinion:** I was intrigued by the idea of getting one's lungs stolen in what has to be the ultimate sci-fi mugging. I also liked the fact that Voyager needs to find fuel - in fact I was reminded of early Battlestar Galactica episodes with this plot line. Kes helps the doctor with some character growth and Neelix is more than comic relief this time, which I appreciated. The organ harvesting aliens were nicely designed, with make up that was quite gross and conveyed the idea behind this race very effectively. 


**105 - The Cloud**

**Summary:** Looking for energy reserves to fuel Janeway's coffeemaker, Voyager flies into a colorful nebula. However, it turns out to actually be a huge life form that the ship accidentally wounded by its passage. Janeway decides to heal the creature, much to the chagrin of Neelix, while Paris invites Kim to his holodeck hideout and Chakotay introduces the Captain to spirit animals.

**Opinion:** I though it was kind of ridiculous that the driving force behind this episode's plot was filling up depleted energy reserves and yet the crew waste a lot of energy running a holodeck simulation of a French tavern. The idea of a giant creature that can be mistaken for a nebula is intriguing but I didn't find this episode very engaging. Neelix's lamentations that Janeway puts the crew in danger by exploring stuff instead of just going home was pleasantly meta and on point, though, and it was my favorite part of this episode.

**106 - Eye of the Needle**

**Summary:** Kim discovers a micro-wormhole that leads to the Alpha Quadrant. It's too small to fly through, but they establish communications with a Romulan science ship on the other side

**Opinion:** This is the first time the crew actually worked towards getting home and they came pretty damn close. It was an intriguing episode and it did some good work establishing that they are really far away and they miss home (something I think the previous episodes kind of failed to do). It was a real bummer that the plan didn't work out, though I didn't expected them o get home in the first season, anyway.


**107 - Ex Post Facto**

**Summary:** Paris is convicted for murdering a scientist and sentenced to relive the deed from the dead man's point of view through a memory implanting procedure that causes him brain damage. Janeway is determined to prove his innocence and Tuvok investigates.

**Opinion:** I really liked the idea of punishing a murderer by making him relive his victim's ordeal over and over again. It was a cool concept, but I wish they did something more interesting with it. The aliens had terrible make up (I honestly don't know what they were going for with [this](http://imgur.com/a/tvJAd) mess) and the murder plot wasn't very engaging. 


**108 - Emanations**

**Summary:** Having discovered a new element in the ring system of a planet, the crew investigate an asteroid's cave, where they find dead bodies cocooned in a white webbing. A subspace anomaly then transports Kim to a funeral parlor on a planet where they're big on the afterlife.

**Opinion:** This episode had a very interesting idea behind a largely boring plot. The crew inadvertently shatter a whole culture's idea of the afterlife and they all have to deal with that. It's a great idea ripe for philosophical exploration but I don't think this episode's script was up to the task.

**109 - Prime Factors**

**Summary:** A famously hospitable alien race invite the crew for some shore leave and Kim discovers they have technology that could transport them at least half-way home. But they won't share it with them.

**Opinion:** Not a bad episode. Again, there is a great idea here that I don't think was explored enough. The alien race never shares their technology with anyone as a rule, because they don't want it to be misused. While the crew are angry about it, Janeway points out that other alien races might feel just as angry about Starfleet's First Contact policy and they should respect the rules of someone superior just as they ask inferior races to respect Starfleet rules of non-interference. Also, I once again did not expect them to get home so soon so it was obvious that the technology wouldn't work even when Tuvok obtained it illegally, so no surprises there.


**110 - State of Flux**

**Summary:** After the crew discover a piece of exploded Starfleet technology on a Kazon ship, Tuvok suspects they may have a mole in their midst. Chakotay's former Maquis crewmember and lover Seska is the prime suspect.

**Opinion:** This was a pretty good episode and it actually gave Seska a pretty good reason for working with the Kazon. My only problem with it is that there was really only one suspect the entire time and all the clues pointed towards Seska from the beginning, so there was no surprising reveal at the end. It was just like yeah, we were right the entire time.

**111 - Heroes and Demons**

**Summary:** Kim goes missing inside his Beowulf holodeck program and Chakotay and Tuvok disappear too when they go looking for him. It's up to the doctor to save them inside the program.

**Opinion:** I was kind of disappointed that another Trek show is doing holodeck malfunction episodes. I had enough of those on TNG, thank you. But, having said that, this was actually a good story and pretty enjoyable to watch. The doctor leaving the sickbay for the first time was a good way for his character to grow and experience new things. However, the final "something tells me this wasn't the last time" wink at the audience was pretty cringey. Yeah, I get it, there will me more holodeck filler episodes with the doc.


**112 - Cathexis**

**Summary:** Janeway's Victorian holodeck adventure is cut short when a shuttlecraft with Chakotay and Tuvok aboard is attacked. Chakotay is left braindead and the crew begin to act strangely as some unseen force is stopping the ship from entering a nebula and pursuing the attackers.

**Opinion:** I always enjoy episodes that have a "The Thing" vibe to them where crew members aren't who they appear to be and you can never know whom to trust. DS9's The Adversary is a favorite of mine for this very reason. Cathexis gave several characters stuff to do and it even gave Chakotay some depth despite the fact that he was absent in most of it. I was definitely glad the episode took this route as the holodeck cold open had me expecting something very different and much more tiresome. However, I'm noticing a somewhat annoying trend where either an episode doesn't deal with getting the ship back home *at all* or they come super close only for it to fall apart at the last minute. Will there ever be some middle ground where Voyager just gets *closer* or they achieve *a step* in some greater plan to get to the Alpha Quadrant?

**113 - Faces**

**Summary:** The organ harvesting aliens from 104 kidnap three crew members including Torres, whom they split into her Klingon and human selves. 

**Opinion:** I wasn't expecting the Vidiians to make another appearance but it' a good thing they did. After intriguing me with stealing a whole set of lungs they did something even more interesting and split Torres into two people. Her strong and brave Klingon version inevitably clashes with the weak and scared human and it was a fun way of exploring the character. I only wish this duality was more central to the episode, as it took a long while before the two Torreses even met. It also got me wondering what it would have been like if they made an episode of TOS in this style and split Spock.


**114 - Jetrel**

**Summary:** A member of the Haakonians, a race warring with the Talaxians, arrives on Voyager. He is responsible for creating a WMD that wiped out a whole Talaxian moon with Neelix's family on it and now he is looking for the cure to a disease caused by the fallout.

**Opinion:** This was an interesting episode that might be best summarized as a meeting between Oppenheimer and a Japanese war veteran. It gave Neelix an unexpected depth that made him out to be a much more serious character than previously presented. While the pace of the episode was quite sluggish, it had some very interesting conversations and introspective moments, making it another example of classic Trek: slow and deep. But I thought the final reveal of the episode, that Jetrel was actually trying to resurrect vaporized people, was a bit too much and it certainly needed a long conversation on the ethics and nuances of bringing people back from the dead.


**115 - Learning Curve**

**Summary:** The ship's irreplaceable bio-mechanical circuits ale malfunctioning and Tuvok is tasked with training insubordinate Maquis crew members.

**Opinion:** This was a great episode (albeit not as a very good season finale) and I think this is what most of season 1 should have been about. The writers had so much potential stories about integrating the rebellious Maquis people into the Starfleet crew, but instead they wasted time with standalone stories like Emanations or Ex Post Facto. This episode was what I was hoping Voyager will be when I started watching. I can only imagine how amazingly the merger of two rival crews would have been handled on a more gritty show like BSG. But when I look back at the 15 episodes, I guess I can't really complain that much. I think Voyager had a better first season than TNG and if it only goes up from here, then I'm hopefully in for something good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a couple of favorite actors and actresses but I'm gonna go with Tom Cruise. I really like his movies, I've been a fan for most of my life and I admire his dedication.

But Tom usually looks amazing in all his roles and that really takes away some of the believability for me. I often find myself watching Tom Cruise instead of watching a character played by Tom Cruise and this is mostly because of how great he always looks. When was the last time he was dirty, unshaven and had messy hair? (Obligatory mention of Tropic Thunder... aaand moving on.) He rarely changes his physicality and I don't see him ever losing a lot of weight or gaining a lot of weight for a role. And I don't really need him to do shit like Christian Bale. I would just like to see him in a totally down to earth role where he just plays a middle aged dad who's way past his prime, with gray messy hair and a five o'clock shadow, cracking dad jokes to his bored teenage kid. The closest he ever came to that sort of role was the working class divorced dad he played in War of the Worlds, but even that was just immaculately looking Tom Cruise in a baseball cap and jeans saving his kids from explosions.

<TEXT> I guess you could argue that having a very weak and forgettable villain and still being a great movie is a testament to the strength of the characters and the story. To me, Logan wasn't about Wolverine's fight with a bad guy so much as an existential, violent road trip exploring fatherhood and old age. The badguy was there just to jumpstart that story and I don't think either the doctor or the robot arm guy were all that important, or really needed to be. The standout villain of the movie was X-24 - essentially Logan's old, berserk self that he's spent so much time running away from. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always though that Civil War was more of an Avengers movie than a Cap movie, though. There are just too many other characters for it to be straight up Cap. This is why I think WS is a better Cap movie than CW but CW is a better Marvel movie than WS. If that makes sense.. </TEXT>

EDIT: I don't mean when an actual athlete is shown in an advertisement (his face/name visible, someone famous). I get that this is just an endorsement. Sometimes they literally say they developed it with athletes as if the athletes were there during R D or something like that. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It's said that 50% of the director's work is casting. If I'd just take Fincher's (amazing) casting, I wouldn't be doing half of my job.

Wow, that is some amazingly flawed logic. According to that, every sequel that's not directed by the original's director should be recast. So, no Weaver in Aliens, no RDJ in Iron Man 3, no Radcliffe, Watson and Grint in Prisoner of Azkaban. I guess according to Alvarez's logic, James Cameron, Shane Black and Alfonso Cuaron are lazy directors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Went to see Silence. Theater was about a third full. The movie was supposed to start at 6.30pm. Which means at 6.30 the lights go out and trailers and ads start. There were about 15 minutes of these before the movie actually started at around 6.45pm. About ten minutes into the movie, a middle aged guy and his wife (I assume) walked in. So they were 25 minutes late! I don't understand why the attendants even let people in after the lights go out, not to mention after the movie starts. But this isn't even the worst part.

In my country we have assigned seating, rows and seat numbers. This dude walks to some people sitting in front of me and, standing above them and blocking the view, he starts harassing them that they are sitting in his seats. I don't know if that's true or not (sometimes people confuse which row they're supposed to be in because they are labeled in a bad way) but anyway, it was his problem that he came in 25 minutes late. He should have just sat somewhere in an empty spot and leave everyone alone, which is what some people told him. This back and forth went on for a while and the dude was still blocking my view and people sitting behind me as well. I asked him how much longer this was going to take and several people shouted at him to sit somewhere and leave everyone alone because he was ruining the movie. His reply to everyone was to fuck off. Finally the people just moved over and they sat down. Then about 30 minutes later he turns around and asks me in a pretty loud and disruptive voice what my seat number is. I would've loved to tell him to just shut the fuck up, but I figured he would just be more disruptive, so I just told him the number. He started looking around my row and informed me I'm not sitting in the correct seat (I 100% was). I still don't understand what his problem was. Then literally about two minutes before the movie ended his wife got up to go to the bathroom, taking her sweet long time blocking the view and walking through her row, disrupting other people that were sitting next to them.

<TEXT> I don't disagree with what you're saying, but I have to point out that those mid-season cliffhangers always felt cheap and forced to me. It always felt like the writers just forcefully came up with some huge moment to end the last episode before hiatus just to make sure people would tune in again in a couple of months. If you have to make a huge cliffhanger to keep people's attention then your show probably isn't all that great. If they had a really good show with compelling characters, people would want to come back to it regardless of cliffhangers. What I always hated the most about these things was how they always got resolved so quickly. Example: In the last episode before hiatus, suddenly out of nowhere one character shoots another character in the last ten seconds of the episode to create a cliffhanger. Four months later, the new episode starts. The gun jammed, nothing happened, nope, thanks for tuning in, here's the rest of our show.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think what he was trying to say was "stop making movies about racism and racism will go away" which kind of makes sense and doesn't at the same time. Racism is the sort of thing where even good publicity is bad publicity, because no matter what anti-racist statement you make, you're still talking about racism and fuelling that word, keeping it alive. It reminded me of an interview with Morgan Freeman where he condemned Black History Month because it reduces an entire race's history to some sort of weird 30 day event. IIRC he argued that it shouldn't be called Black History Month, it should just be history. Calling it Black and making a thing out of it is just another way of separating it from white history.

<TEXT> His take on the Netflix "release it all at once" model is surprisingly old-fashioned. On the one hand, I get what he means when he says: 

 I would want people to come back every week and have the experience of watching something at the same time.

That kind of "holy shit, did you watch last night?" conversation the next day at work is great. But that's not a lasting thing and it's not a universal thing. The shows get syndicated to other countries that might air them differently (one station in my country usually airs at least two episodes back to back) and you have the home video releases. The experience is fleeting and cannot be repeated. So why limit yourself by adhering to it?

I would also argue that "holy shit, did you watch last night?" is still applicable even with binge watching. When Stranger Things came out, it was still a major water cooler conversation topic. It's just that people talked about multiple episodes instead of one. Experiencing a show together and binge watching are not mutually exclusive things and airing something weekly does not guarantee the communal experience. </TEXT>

I really hope the marketing campaign for this movie won't turn out to be far better than the film itself. (Which, I feel, was the case with Prometheus.) For example, that previous video they released with the going-away crew party was great, but I sure hope the film itself will manage to show us the bonds between the crew and not just rely on us having seen the youtube clip. The movie should speak for itself without prior external knowledge filling in blanks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It did feel quite pointless to me, too. I definitely got the sense that they left out all the most interesting and dramatic parts in-between the periods depicted in the movie. It definitely felt weird to me that [Mahershala Ali's character died offscreen, so we never even got to watch how Chiron dealt with losing a father figure.](#spoiler) I also thought that seeing the transition between Chiron's confused and bullied high-school self to his tough adult version would have been interesting to watch instead of a short recap in a diner room conversation. The film was very episodic and only lightly touched on themes without actually exploring them. Even the LGBT angle that is so talked about felt underdeveloped to me. There were only three short instances of Chiron's homosexuality even coming up. As a kid he asked what faggot means, as a teenager he had a brief sexual encounter and as an adult he had a quasi date. That's it.

<TEXT> No cell phone signal / characters that don't just solve a situation easily with a phone 

Horror movies still haven't adapted to the modern age where phone calls are readily available to everyone and phones can solve a lot of situations. Most horror movies do one of these things to work around phones:

* there's no signal

* battery runs out

* the character inexplicably just doesn't use the phone

* the setting is in the pre-cell phone era or the existence of phones is ignored

[The Monster](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3976144/) is a movie that totally subverted this cliche. A woman has a car crash in the middle of nowhere on a forest road but the phone works and she actually immediately takes it out, calls for help and the help actually arrives. I was dumbfounded that this happened. A working phone that was used with a positive result. In a horror movie. Wow.

<TEXT>  I think the characters and performances are really bland all around and the themes of the movie are very surface level and not very subtle.

The characters deal with incredible emotional struggles and the movie is filled with introspective scenes. Roy Batty feels more alive and has had more experiences than most real people, yet he is doomed to die, making all those moments he lived through lost like tears in rain. He wants nothing more than to prolong his life. It's a great struggle for a character and an interesting theme. Tyrell basically makes these replicants completely human, giving them memories and the ability to have emotions, yet he gives them just four years to live, essentially sentencing sentient beings to death. Does he have the right to do so as their creator (manufacturer) or do they have a right to live?

Rachael's story is also extremely intriguing and imo very well acted. She is a person who finds out that she's not actually a person but a machine with someone else's memories, which completely destroys her identity and self image. But it also raises an interesting question about what it actually means to be a person and how do you define that. Were her emotions fake just because her memories were fake? Or does she has legitimate sentience and the same rights as humans?

And of course we have Deckard, whose identity is completely ambiguous and up for debate. Is he a real person or just another replicant designed to hunt other dangerous replicants, essentially a tool to do people's dirty work? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never interpreted that scene as rape. More like Deckard forcing her to acknowledge the emotions she is dismissing because she has a huge identity crisis. He more or less orders her to say that she loves him. As in: if you love me, just say it, it doesn't make a difference that you're not human, you feel love.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep he was a blade runner, too. I am fairly certain that the police chief mentions this to Deckard when he has him in his office. If not directly, it's at least implied. There's also an interesting deleted scene where Deckard visits the guy in the hospital (he survived the shooting)

Edit: It's also clear that the opening scene happens in Tyrell Corp. So not a mining company. I guess the replicant was trying to infiltrate Tyrell Corp (probably by getting employed there) to gain access to Eldon Tyrell and he was discovered through this screening. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I kind of don't agree. We don't even find out the real reason why he wants to keep the land so badly until halfway through the movie, Jeff Bridges' "investigation" was pleasantly understated (basically him deducing where the robbers will strike next and just sitting around waiting for them) and I definitely didn't expect [Chris Pine to actually get away with it. The final scene between Pine and Bridges had a nice questing beast ring to it.](#spoiler)

EDIT: Also the waitress covering for them was a nice touch and all the trigger happy townspeople chasing after them towards the end was oddly hilarious for me as a European with a clear "Don't mess with Texas" picture in my head. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  For example, Deckard all of a sudden has an obsession with these photos that he found at a house that I didn't even realise he went to, and then we get this long scene of him looking at one of the photos and eventually finding an image of a replicant within it, but how did he know to go see her or that she was a replicant?

No offense but it seems like you really weren't paying attention. First of all, he knew how all the escaped replicants looked from the files he was shown by the police boss. The apartment he went to belonged to the replicant Leon Kowalski - he was the one from the opening scene of the movie that shot the other blade runner during the test. Deckard went there to investigate. In the apartment he found the pictures, so he took them as evidence, along with the snake scale in the bathtub. He looked through the photos and noticed a reflection in the mirror, which he enhanced in his computer to reveal one of the replicants with a snake. He realized he could track her down using the snake scale he found, because the snake was genetically created. So he takes the scale to the marketplace where a snake seller tells him the snake belongs to the replicant Zhora. he goes to the night club, has a chat with Zhora, chases her through the street and kills her. Meanwhile, Roy takes JF Sebastian to meet and kill Eldon Tyrrel. Since they used JF Sebastian's identity to get inside the building, Deckard knew to go to JF's house to look for the replicants, where he shoots Pris and fights Roy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I realize this first part will be nothing more than crying over spilt milk, but let me start with examining the first three movies. I have a few ideas on how to improve them and make them more interesting. Of course, these are all just my opinions, but hopefully you will find them valid.

**Star Trek**

This movie did a lot of things right, but there's still room for improvement. They connected the new movies to the old ones by including Spock Prime and at the same time they set them completely apart by making this an alternate timeline. I think they did this for two reasons. One, they wanted to have Leonard Nimoy in the movie to grant it more legitimacy and please old fans. And two, they wanted to have the ability to tell new stories and change things without negating or retconning what came before. Both were wise decisions, but why not take the concept a bit further and utilize Spock Prime in a more interesting way? In my scenario Spock Prime is more of a character than a presence and we see more things from his perspective. He fails to save Romulus from the supernova but he realizes that the resulting black hole could take him back in time and he would have another shot at saving the planet. Unfortunately, Nero witnesses the destruction of Romulus and oblivious to Spock Prime's plan, he follows him into the black hole seeking revenge and this action causes both Nero and Spock Prime to be thrown out of the black hole at the wrong point in space and time. This creates the new timeline because the Nerada interferes with USS Kelvin. So Spock Prime's action inadvertently creates an alternate reality and kills Kirk's father. Much of the film then plays out similarly or equally to the existing film, showing us the Kirk origin story and putting the crew together, etc. But Spock Prime watches from a distance, fascinated. Then a great source of conflict would be the destruction of Vulcan, which I would change from the way it was done in the movie. The destruction of Vulcan would actually be the finale of the movie instead of happening in the middle and Spock Prime would have to sacrifice the planet in order to defeat Nero, causing great inner conflict both for himself and for the young Spock. Let's say Nero goes to Vulcan to steal a prototype of what would eventually become Spock Prime's black hole machine and he wants to use it to destroy not only Vulcan, but the whole galaxy. He starts creating a massive black hole but before he succeeds, the Enterprise and Spock prime create a smaller black hole that sucks in the Nerada but also destroys Vulcan in the process and kills Spock Prime.

**Star Trek Into Darkness**

Let's say you absolutely have to go darker and you absolutely have to use Khan. Sure. But why not go all the way and be really dark? Why not use Khan in a way we haven't seen yet? General (?) Marcus wanted to prepare the Federation for future wars, so why not show one? In my scenario for this movie, the Federation is at war with the Klingons and it's losing. Like really getting their asses kicked. Pike is not riding a desk but leading the charge into hopeless battle, with Kirk and the Enterprise by his side. Pike's ship is destroyed in front of Kirk's eyes and he feels tremendous sorrow at losing his surrogate father figure, and he feels guilt over not being able to help him, which turns into blind rage. He is determined to have his vengeance and defeat the Klingons. This is Wrath of Kirk more than Wrath of Khan, already turning this remake on its head and doing something different. Kirk studies the Starfleet archives to learn new tactics from older, more savage times and during his studies of the Eugenics wars he learns of the program that created Khan. Appealing to Starfleet and recruiting Marcus to his side he instigates Khan's resurrection, which helps turn the tide and gives Starfleet the upper hand in the war. But for the mad Khan winning battles isn't enough and he starts to kick the Klingons' ass so much that he starts committing atrocities. He goes full Kurtz and Kirk realizes that his revenge is causing the same kind of pain and suffering that he went through and he is no better than the Klingons. Moral dilemmas and introspection galore. In the end Kirk has to go up the proverbial river to stop Khan, sacrificing himself in the process, because the survival of many outweighs the need for revenge of the one. Aaand then they can bring him back with Khan's blood or whatever.

**Star Trek Beyond**

This movie got a lot of things right, owing to Simon Pegg's script. The first twenty or so minutes of the movie are brilliant, setting up inner conflicts, emotional stakes and exploring the toll of isolation in space. However, much of that is later lost and completely obscured by studio-mandated action. In my scenario, Enterprise's destruction still happens, but it's much more emotionally impactful because it hasn't already happened twice in the two previous movies, so instead of going "not this again" the audience goes "oh my god the Enterprise is down" which is obviously much better. And if you absolutely need to have an evil villain in a Star Trek movie, make him more compelling. Dispense with action in favor of characters. Trek is absolutely the kind of franchise where the villain should talk to the hero and explain his entire motivation and plan. You know, what the Bond movies have been doing for decades. At the beginning of the movie Kirk is weary of space exploration, so have him confront the results of exploration gone wrong. What happened to Krall could easily have happened to Kirk, too. Don't give Kirk a motorcycle, give him inner conflict and demons to confront. And have Spock help him find the right path, solidifying their friendship and showing Spock that Kirk really needs him more than the Vulcans, so he can't leave Starfleet and Kirk's side.


So what is next in store for the crew of Starship Enterprise? I have a couple of ideas for future movies that would solve some of the problems of the existing three installments.


**Alternates**

The franchise already exists in an alternate timeline, so let's play with that a bit. Mirror universes, alternate realities and various timelines are staples of Trek. These sort of things work best when you already have your characters established, making it more interesting and entertaining to meet their counterparts and see them behave differently. It's also a good way to learn something new about the existing characters when they meet their counterparts. After three movies the new Trek crew are established well enough to warrant taking this route. Have a bit of fun with it but also explore the characters in depth at the same time. For example, one scenario could explore a world where Kirk never joined Starfleet. After he ran away from home he led a pointless existence, eventually going to space on a freighter and working a blue collar job. Not bound by duty to Starfleet or any five year missions, he also had the opportunity to create a family. Now what if that Kirk switched places with the Starfleet captain we know and love? Freighter Kirk would miss his family, but he would discover what it means to be captain and having the crew as family, learning something about duty and friendship along the way and confronting his past. Meanwhile, Starfleet Kirk would discover what it is like to have an actual family and what life without the Enterprise could be like, questioning his career. Throw in some conflict (for example, the Kirk switcheroo may have been deliberately caused by an antagonist) and you have yourself a movie.


**Make the Enterprise great again**

The Enterprise is supposed to be a flagship. Top of the line. A formidable opponent and an imposing presence if need be, but also a vessel of pure research and exploration. So far in the three new movies we've seen almost none of that. The ship repeatedly gets its ass kicked and performs no science whatsoever. But in the original series the ship is like a submarine in space (this idea largely reflected in the stealthy and subtle combat scenes as well as the use of torpedoes) and this is something I miss in the new franchise. It's also on a mission to explore strange new worlds and seek out new life and new civilizations, but science was notably absent in the new movies. What has Spock done in his capacity as Chief Science Officer? Have they ever really fired a probe or scanned a class M planet? Has the ship ever had the upper hand in a standoff or posed a threat to anyone? Since they once again destroyed it in Beyond, now is the perfect opportunity to design a new Enterprise and have it do new things (and by new I mean have it do the really old things it was always meant to do). 


**Star Trek doesn't need a villain**

The universe is vast and poses threats beyond some generic bad guys out for revenge or world domination. While the franchise has a nice roster of villains and antagonistic alien races, it's not all about those types of conflict. The ship is on its way to literally a place where no one else has gone before ...so why should it encounter familiar things? Give me a crystalline entity, a planet eating ship, an exiled Greek god or a long extinct civilization that's still holding secrets. Give me a large animal living in space like a deep sea creature, or a space-time anomaly, or a mysterious cosmic event. Give me anything besides a traditional villain. The Enterprise can fight all sorts of foes and stand up to all sorts of dangers. And why should it always encounter an opposing force or a threat to begin with? What if you had a movie like Contact set in the Star Trek universe? The Enterprise is somewhere far away, charting new territory, when it receives a signal. The crew have to work together to decipher it, the captain is faced with a difficult decision whether to pursue the signal into the dangerous far reaches of space or not, and overcoming some problems and dilemmas along the way they finaly get to a new destination where they learn something new. And what about a scenario like Arrival? Why do we need a standalone movie from a director largely known for thrillers to show us a perfect first contact story while a franchise that should be all about stuff like that is pretending to be an action movie? What happened to mystery, intrigue and discovery?


**Star Trek doesn't need Kirk and Spock**

I realize there's a new show coming up, but I'm going to make this point anyway. Star Trek doesn't need familiar things to succeed. It's vast and filled with great characters just waiting to be discovered. TOS, TNG, DS9, Voyager and Enterprise created a shared universe decades before anyone even dreamed of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and yet we're pretending as if the MCU is some unbelievable new thing. Trek already had what the MCU spent many films establishing. But instead of utilizing that fact, the producers decided to just bring back a new flashier version of nostalgic characters. I understand why they did it, there is no need to explain box office appeal or the logic behind reboots. But after three movies that were wholly average and underwhelming at the box office, maybe it's time to experiment and create something new. I don't expect them to make a long overdue DS9 movie or to bring back the TNG crew. I don't *want* them to. But they could start fresh. Maybe make a Generations style crossover movie with an appearance from the Kirk crew, but make something new. Show us a different part of Starfleet. Or take the Rogue One route and depict a well-known event from Trek lore that we never really got to see.


**Star Trek doesn't need a big budget**

If you're going to make a big budget movie, you need it to make all that money back, and then some. To make sure that happens, you need to make that movie appealing to a broad audience. That's how you get Star Trek Beyond the action movie instead of Star Trek Beyond the character driven space drama. What you end up with is an action movie that's too generic to please the general public hooked on Marvel and Star Wars, and also a movie that's not going to appeal to your core fan base. In other words, you have a mess that cost too much and made too little. But Star Trek was never about big budgets, it was about big stories. Week after week the creators managed to churn out great episodes on TV budgets with insufficient special effects. That creates restraint and science fiction has always benefited from restraint. Filmmakers like George Lucas and James Cameron have talked about having big ideas that weren't possible to film because the technology hadn't caught up with their visions. But when you look at their output created under restraint (Star Wars, The Terminator) and compare it with their technologically advanced output (Attack of the Clones, Avatar) it's clear that restraint breeds better results. Jaws was so effective because it revealed the shark gradually. It didn't blow its load with a money shot right at the beginning but kept the shark shrouded in mystery and menace. It was incredibly effective and it was due to restraint. The rubber shark puppet was unrealistic and often malfunctioning, so it had to be used with restraint. And the result is movie history. When you watch TOS episodes, most of the show has sets that are nothing but a blank wall bathed in colorful lights. Does that take away anything from the story, though? I am all for beautiful visuals and great effects, but the need for them does not outweigh the need for a good script. I would much rather sacrifice the former in favor of the latter. As it stands, the three new Trek movies are very much like the hated prequel trilogy of Star Wars. Lots of style, not enough substance. Give me a low budget Trek movie that doesn't have to make huge money to break even. Give me a story that doesn't have to be appealing to a general audience. Arrival's budget was $47 million yet it managed to have cool spaceships, cool aliens, great actors, and a great story. Star Trek Beyond had a budget of $185 million, which is ridiculous. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me just point out that I never said I want a DS9 or TNG movie, or to reboot those two properties. In fact I specifically said I don't want that.

Relevant:
 I don't expect them to make a long overdue DS9 movie or to bring back the TNG crew. I don't want them to.

Also, as far as that success of the new films go, not one of them made any big money and Into Darkness is considered by fans to be the worst Trek movie ever, so I wouldn't really call that successful. As far as the marketability of a new crew goes, that is why I also proposed lower budgets for these movies. Lower budget means it has to make less money back. </TEXT>

The franchise already exists in an alternate timeline, so let's play with that a bit. Mirror universes, alternate realities and various timelines are staples of Trek. These sort of things work best when you already have your characters established, making it more interesting and entertaining to meet their counterparts and see them behave differently. It's also a good way to learn something new about the existing characters when they meet their counterparts. After three movies the new Trek crew are established well enough to warrant taking this route. Have a bit of fun with it but also explore the characters in depth at the same time. For example, one scenario could explore a world where Kirk never joined Starfleet. After he ran away from home he led a pointless existence, eventually going to space on a freighter and working a blue collar job. Not bound by duty to Starfleet or any five year missions, he also had the opportunity to create a family. Now what if that Kirk switched places with the Starfleet captain we know and love? Freighter Kirk would miss his family, but he would discover what it means to be captain and having the crew as family, learning something about duty and friendship along the way and confronting his past. Meanwhile, Starfleet Kirk would discover what it is like to have an actual family and what life without the Enterprise could be like, questioning his career. Throw in some conflict (for example, the Kirk switcheroo may have been deliberately caused by an antagonist) and you have yourself a movie.

**Make the Enterprise great again**

The Enterprise is supposed to be a flagship. Top of the line. A formidable opponent and an imposing presence if need be, but also a vessel of pure research and exploration. So far in the three new movies we've seen almost none of that. The ship repeatedly gets its ass kicked and performs no science whatsoever. But in the original series the ship is like a submarine in space (this idea largely reflected in the stealthy and subtle combat scenes as well as the use of torpedoes) and this is something I miss in the new franchise. It's also on a mission to explore strange new worlds and seek out new life and new civilizations, but science was notably absent in the new movies. What has Spock done in his capacity as Chief Science Officer? Have they ever really fired a probe or scanned a class M planet? Has the ship ever had the upper hand in a standoff or posed a threat to anyone? Since they once again destroyed it in Beyond, now is the perfect opportunity to design a new Enterprise and have it do new things (and by new I mean have it do the really old things it was always meant to do). 

**Star Trek doesn't need a villain**

The universe is vast and poses threats beyond some generic bad guys out for revenge or world domination. While the franchise has a nice roster of villains and antagonistic alien races, it's not all about those types of conflict. The ship is on its way to literally a place where no one else has gone before ...so why should it encounter familiar things? Give me a crystalline entity, a planet eating ship, an exiled Greek god or a long extinct civilization that's still holding secrets. Give me a large animal living in space like a deep sea creature, or a space-time anomaly, or a mysterious cosmic event. Give me anything besides a traditional villain. The Enterprise can fight all sorts of foes and stand up to all sorts of dangers. And why should it always encounter an opposing force or a threat to begin with? What if you had a movie like Contact set in the Star Trek universe? The Enterprise is somewhere far away, charting new territory, when it receives a signal. The crew have to work together to decipher it, the captain is faced with a difficult decision whether to pursue the signal into the dangerous far reaches of space or not, and overcoming some problems and dilemmas along the way they finaly get to a new destination where they learn something new. And what about a scenario like Arrival? Why do we need a standalone movie from a director largely known for thrillers to show us a perfect first contact story while a franchise that should be all about stuff like that is pretending to be an action movie? What happened to mystery, intrigue and discovery?

**Star Trek doesn't need Kirk and Spock**

I realize there's a new show coming up, but I'm going to make this point anyway. Star Trek doesn't need familiar things to succeed. It's vast and filled with great characters just waiting to be discovered. TOS, TNG, DS9, Voyager and Enterprise created a shared universe decades before anyone even dreamed of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and yet we're pretending as if the MCU is some unbelievable new thing. Trek already has what the MCU spent many films establishing. But instead of utilizing that fact, the producers decided to just bring back a new flashier version of nostalgic characters. I understand why they did, there is no need to explain box office appeal or the logic behind reboots. But after three movies that were wholly average and underwhelming at the box office, maybe it's time to experiment and create something new. I don't expect them to make a long overdue DS9 movie or to bring back the TNG crew. I don't *want* them to. But they could start fresh. Maybe make a Generations style crossover movie with an appearance from the Kirk crew, but make something new. Show us a different part of Starfleet. Or take the Rogue One route and depict a well-known event from Trek lore that we never really got to see.

**Star Trek doesn't need a big budget**

If you're going to make a big budget movie, you need it to make all that money back, and then some. To make sure that happens, you need to make that movie appealing to a broad audience. That's how you get Star Trek Beyond the action movie instead of Star Trek Beyond the character driven space drama. What you end up with is an action movie that's too generic to please the general public hooked on Marvel and Star Wars, and also a movie that's not going to appeal to your core fan base. In other words, you have a mess that cost too much and made too little. But Star Trek was never about big budgets, it was about big stories. Week after week the creators managed to churn out great episodes on TV budgets with insufficient special effects. That creates restraint and science fiction has always benefited from restraint. Filmmakers like George Lucas and James Cameron have talked about having big ideas that weren't possible to film because the technology hadn't caught up with their visions. But when you look at their output created under restraint (Star Wars, The Terminator) and compare it with their technologically advanced output (Attack of the Clones, Avatar) it's clear that restraint breeds better results. Jaws was so effective because it revealed the shark gradually. It didn't blow its load with a money shot right at the beginning but kept the shark shrouded in mystery and menace. It was incredibly effective and it was due to restraint. The rubber shark puppet was unrealistic and often malfunctioning, so it had to be used with restraint. And the result is movie history. When you watch TOS episodes, most of the show has sets that are nothing but a blank wall bathed in colorful lights. Does that take away anything from the story, though? I am all for beautiful visuals and great effects, but the need for them does not outweigh the need for a good script. I would much rather sacrifice the former in favor of the latter. As it stands, the three new Trek movies are very much like the hated prequel trilogy of Star Wars. Lots of style, not enough substance. Give me a low budget Trek movie that doesn't have to make huge money to break even. Give me a story that doesn't have to be appealing to a general audience. Arrival's budget was $47 million yet it managed to have cool spaceships, cool aliens, great actors, and a great story. Star Trek Beyond had a budget of $185 million, which is ridiculous. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seventeen years ago the first X-Men turned Hugh Jackman into a star and ushered in the era of comic book movies that changed the landscape of summer blockbusters and is still as strong today as ever. Now Jackmans last movie in the iconic role gives us a new vision of what these movies can be. Not like Deadpool, with its over the top meme-like siliness, but an emotionally driven, self-contained personal drama with small scale action. The whole world is not at stake. There is no CG destruction. Instead, this is a stand-alone movie thats not concerned with any larger universe or previous movies or any  franchise baggage. Its just Logan, Charles and Laura against some bad guys. Dirty, ugly, gritty, tense, superbly acted and realistically violent. Simply put, the movie does not fuck around. Wolverine is a violent beast who kills people with huge claws and we finally get to see that without any PG-13 neutering. Jackman can be proud of his swan song and fans can only wish the previous movies were half as good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would like to tell you OP that I really enjoyed this video and I agreed with almost everything. (Though I have a problem with Jane Bond, but not because of the fact that she's a woman. Rather, I don't like that people would turn it into a huge deal and the manufactured controversy would tarnish the experience no matter how good the movie would be.)

I must say I really liked the idea of two simultaneous franchises set apart in time. There is precedent for this, most notably with the X-Men franchise and its First Class sub-franchise, but also in a little something called Star Trek. The various shows coexisting alongside each other as (almost exclusively) separate stories is exactly what could work with Bond. Just consider this: there are *two* iconic starships *Enterprise* and *two* iconic Captains. And DS9's airdates overlap the air dates of both TNG and Voyager, proving that these separate timeline franchises can also work simultaneously and not just one following after the other as TOS and TNG. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I feel like for some people the liveliness of La La Land or atmosphere of Arrival is unbeaten this year.

I think this is the main issue. I really liked Manchester a lot but there is no way I'll ever watch it again. Too depressing. But I've already seen Arrival twice and I can see myself returning to La La Land whenever there's an opportunity. I guess that rewatchability isn't a real factor but many people will consider it nonetheless.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I haven't seen JW2 yet but in the first movie Wick actually got his ass kicked a couple of times and I wouldn't call all of his kills effortless. Also, I really consider JW to be essentially like a comic book movie, or definitely at least a sort of heightened reality. It has its own mythos and style that isn't really going for realism. Whereas I think the two Fallen movies were going for something gritty and more realistic at least in terms of depicting terrorism instead of stylized international assassins. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Fifth Estate was on TV yesterday, which made me remember this recent but already forgotten movie. Nobody seems to ever talk about this movie, either to praise any part of it or to mock it. 

What, in your opinion, made it fail both critically and commercially? 

I can't say how accurate it was, but I don't think it's a bad movie. The acting was pretty good, the direction too, it wasn't cheaply made, the cast was appealing...So what happened? Was it the subject matter? Bad marketing? Small release?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think Fellowship is by far the best one. While it doesn't really have an ending, it's the one that works best on its own and for me it has the most memorable moments and the least amount of things to complain about. Two Towers is the typical middle part with no real beginning and end and the cutting back and forth between Treebeard and Helm's Deep always irritated me. I get cutting away from action for quieter moments, but this felt like going from 100 to 0. Return of the King is getting too full of CG for my taste, I kind of hate how the ghost army looked, and there is too much good material left on the cutting room floor (or the extended dvd) for me to call it really great.  </TEXT>

But yeah, their system is hardly perfect.

<TEXT> The reservation system is online and there you have the option of either just reserving or directly buying. I guess this allows you to reserve and then not stress about changing your plans last minute because you haven't paid yet. And, for some reason, the online system only allows you to pay with paypal and nothing else, but paypal isn't really all that popular here, so not everyone has an account. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my country the reserved seating is only valid up to 30 minutes before the movie starts. So you have to buy your reserved seats before that deadline, otherwise the reservations are cancelled and the seats are available for purchase again. This way you can't have a situation where someone reserves half the theater and doesn't actually buy anything. It also means you can still get good seats if people don't show up or if they are late.

EDIT: Also, these theaters are usually in shopping malls so it forces people to show up early and then they can kill time with shopping.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This film was described as a bad Shutter Island, but a more accurate wording would be that it's an unsuccessful one. Set against the backdrop of the Swiss Alps and with some amazing interiors, A Cur for Wellness has beautiful cinematography and an eerie atmosphere to boot. The performances are all perfectly ok, with no one standing out either positively or negatively. The pace, however, can get excruciatingly slow. Normally a slower pace can create a creepy mood and is genre-appropriate, but Verbinski takes this too far. There is no reason why this movie needed to be 146 minutes long and filled with shots of DeHaan walking slowly on crutches. The plot doesn't really support this pace, either, with very little happening at one point, only to be replaced with an info-dumping conversation or a needless bar fight at another point. Speaking of plot, the movie spirals into increasingly fantastical territory and leaves you with poorly defined concepts and plot holes galore. The inevitable "what was the point" question arises in the viewer, one that even breathtaking visuals are not enough to answer. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I re-watched Arrival and I think it's a near-perfect movie with three flaws that really bother me </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So as the title says, I watched Arrival again. I really liked in the theater and the re-watch only confirmed that it's an amazing movie. There are three things that bother me about it, though. You might consider this nit picking, but bear with me for a sec.

1. Roughly a third into the movie there is a montage scene with a voice over from Jeremy Renner's character Ian. This scene feels very out of place to me. It's an info dump with no real purpose other than to move the plot forward by summarizing a few events and explaining a few concepts we'll need later on. I understand the need for it but I resent the execution. To me it feels like something from a completely different movie. Or it just doesn't make sense to me. It sounds like Ian is giving an interview on TV or like he's recording thoughts for his diary, except neither of those is true (or at least neither is shown) and so there's no reason for Ian to be giving a voice over narration that is pure exposition. It took me out of the movie both times I watched it.

2. The big twist of the movie is that scenes with Louise's daughter aren't flashbacks but flashforwards. But I think this twist was revealed (or at least made way too obvious) one scene too early. When her daughter asks Louise about that scientific expression for a win-win scenario, Louise tells her that if she wants science, she should ask her father. At that point it becomes obvious that she is talking about Ian, and since they only just met during the present events, it becomes clear to the audience that this scene must be in the future. But it's only until the next scene, when Ian in the present uses that word in a sentence and Louise is able to tell it to her daughter in the future that Louise figures out what's going on. I wish the audience and the character figured it out at the same time. I think that would have been more impactful, as we would be experiencing the same mindfuck as Louise at the same time when she is reacting to it.

3. I hate the digital hair. When Louise enters the ship towards the end of the movie, her hair becomes wavy and flows as if she were underwater or in lighter gravity - or I guess that's what it was meant to convey. But the effect looked terrible and once again took me out of the movie both times I watched it. All the other effects in the movie are great, displaying beautiful design and a measure of restraint, but the hair is just...terrible and pointless.

So those are my three problems with Arrival. It's still an ace movie, but not perfect.

EDIT: I seriously don't understand all the downvotes. What is your problem, people? Is it really so unacceptable to say one negative thing about reddit's beloved movie? Can you not appreciate that I took time to word my thoughts on Arrival in a coherent way and provide a real argument? I would understand downvoting something like "Arrival sucks" but this is just ridiculous. Thanks a lot for the conversation. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It would be awesome, but it's somewhat unlikely. The only reason John Wick can hold steady, long shots of amazing action is because Keanu is a dedicated, skilled actor.

There is also the possibility that maybe studios should hire capable actors and build movies around them, not the other way around. Like maybe don't cast Liam Neeson in an action movie when the dude's in his 60s and doesn't have the moves. I'm sure there are more dedicated and skilled actors out there besides Reeves and Cruise. Maybe they're unknowns. But you don't need a star to make a good action movie, you need a badass.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  My main problem was that it had no reason to exist- it was just a rehash of the original with some Americanization.

But that is the exact reason WHY it exists! It's great that you are interested in movies enough to have heard of this Korean film everyone else seemed to love and checked it out. It's great that you don't mind reading subtitles. It's great that you embrace foreign cinema. I do, too. But most people don't. Most people won't watch anything with subtitles because it's off-putting to them. Most people won't watch Korean movies because they seem too foreign to them or too unrelatable. And let's face it, most people have trouble recognizing Asian people and differentiating between them. And when I say most people, I mean the target audience of these remakes, which is middle class (probably preferably white) Americans. These are the people studious cater to. Producers take a good foreign movie, remake it with recognizable preferably white actors and in a relatable setting and these people pay to see that product. It's custom made for them. Even if you put "the Korean original is better" on the American Oldboy poster, most people would still not watch a bunch of Koreans in a foreign land talk in their incomprehensible language when they can watch a good looking, American-as-apple-pie actor and a hot young blonde. This isn't rocket science.  </TEXT>

I'm not saying the critic's opinion is automatically better/true or that I necessarily adjust my viewing habits based on these pro reviews, but I absolutely think someone like Ebert was a million times better at judging films compared to you or me. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  seemed to be what Cameron was most interested in discussing.

You mean like in interviews? I would understand why the director might want to talk about the technical aspects of his movie and leave other topics to actors. That doesn't bother me. And he was always pushing the boundaries. His first short movie was super effects heavy. And he utilized masterfully created puppets and animatronics. And he pioneered CG. But he did all as support for story, not as a main drive for story. If he is becoming Lucas (and that is a frightening thought) then I would say it only started with Avatar. What I find really odd and somewhat off-putting is that he didn't let go of Avatar for a while and do something else in the interim. Instead he decided to do four more Avatars in a row and took almost ten years writing them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It relied more on visual spectacle than on building stories and characters. When we look back at Cameron's two best movies, Terminator was a pretty low budget movie that took its time to develop Sarah and give her some character development, and Aliens has almost an hour of time spent with characters before the action drops. Avatar has...uhm..colors and 3D. The visuals are the only reason why it made so much money. It was the first movie I've ever seen in 3D and I went to see it three times (though once was for free) solely for this reason. Not the characters, acting, or story.

In comparison, while Star Wars had groundbreaking visuals when it came out, nowadays they don't look so hot. But we stayed for the characters. And while Dr. Strange had those cool action sequences, I liked it for the humor, actors and the ending. </TEXT>

A person who logs in to reddit and gives their opinion on a movie is nothing but a random person giving his opinion. A film critic is a professional (meaning they get paid for it) who probably studied journalism, has experience, and is good enough at giving balanced and well versed opinions that they were hired by a news outlet to do so.

Similarly, a person who runs really fast to catch a bus is nothing but a random person running really fast. An athlete is a professional (meaning they get paid for it - at least in sponsorship deals or prizes) who probably trained for most of their life and who is good enough at running fast that corporations pay to have their logo on tight shorts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ryan Reynolds most likely signed up for this movie and negotiated his contract (and thus his billing order) before Deadpool came out. At that time I don't think his popularity or box office draw were that high. Also, as I mentioned in another comment, you don't know how much screentime he'll have compared to the other two. 

I don't know what kind of box office draw Gyllenhaal has but apparently he plays the lead role and maybe he has a better agent who negotiated more money and top billing for him. I don't know what else to say since I'm not privy to the behind the scenes negotiations of this movie. But that is simply how billing actors works.

As a side note, Gyllenhaal is also a more respected actor in terms of his craft, so putting him first makes sense if you want to lend your movie more seriousness and gravitas. As for Fergusson, I can only assume that either her role is big enough to warrant her billing over Reynolds, or she negotiated her contract coming off of Mission Impossible, where she had a big role that was very well received. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure what "it can sometimes" refers to in your comment, but as for the rest, consider these points:

* The order of names in the credits was contractually predetermined before the movie even began shooting, so nothing you or anyone else says about the poster will ever take precedent over that order

*  On the other hand, since the order is determined in advance, the artist creating a poster probably views the names as just another legal line, same as the blocks of credits that appear on the bottom. It's just something that has to be there and that's that. Why limit yourself creatively because of it?

* This poster will be turned into tons of various formats including web banners where the names might me too small to read, or billboards next to highways, where even if the names are big enough, you won't have enough time to read them when you drive by. So ultimately, the order of the names doesn't really matter so much in relation to the big faces, because you might miss the names but you are bound to see the faces.

* As I mentioned in my previous comment, usually you put the most important thing in the center of the poster, because people tend to view pictures head on and focus on the center of the frame first. Why would you disregard this natural human tendency and put Gyllenhaal to the left just because two years ago he signed a contract that put his name first? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep. I think that's called double billing, where one actor is the first from left to right and the other is first from top to bottom. It's pretty common on TV, I think. For example, [Hannibal had Mikkelsen and Dancy appear this way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz3qclEk5kI) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The order of the names on the poster reflects the order of names in the movie's credits, which indicates who has top billing. When you have top billing, your name is the first one. Usually this means the actor has the lead role, but it can also just mean the actor is the most famous, or the biggest box office draw, or the one with the best contract. For example, Marlon Brando had top billing in Superman despite appearing in it only briefly. If this were an Indiana Jones movie and Indie's face were in the bottom right corner surrounded by twelve other actors, Harrison Ford would still be the first name in the row.

As for the order of faces, who knows? Either it's just an esthetic choice, or the thinking here is that visually you should put the main actor in the center because that's where your eyes focus the most. </TEXT>

<TEXT> With Deadpool levels of fourth wall breaking and pop culture references, this movie is a laugh out loud blast for audiences aged 15-35. It's a straight up parody of Batman, mocking his previous movie iterations and the inherent ridiculousness of a playboy billionaire dressing up as a bat with branded gadgets, while also getting the character right and exploring him in a hyper-meta kind of way. But it also mixes in lessons about family and team work that feel like they're taken straight out of a Disney sob story, which are obviously aimed at a younger audience. This creates a certain imbalance, where the movie tries to be entertaining for all ages but can't really balance the two tones without a noticeable shift from one to the other. This, however, is not a significant fault and doesn't happen too often to be overly distracting. Visually it follows in the footsteps of the first Lego movie with breathtakingly colorful and cinematic animation that often feels like stop motion on speed and is a joy to look at. Not only is this a great animated movie, it's also a hilarious comedy and a cool Batman flick that should be a real crowd pleaser. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I told my girlfriend about [After Hours](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088680/) and she immediately thought of another movie that takes place over a single night. But of course she has no clue what it's called or who's in it. Supposedly it's a dark comedy (though she's not entirely sure so don't focus on comedies) and there's a murderer (or murderers - anyway, there's a lot of deaths) and it takes place in a small town where all the characters somehow know each other. It's definitely not [Identity](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309698/) but could be something similar (genre, atmosphere). She's seen it maybe four years ago, so I think we're looking for movies made up to 2013.

Thanks!

There are all these well known, unashamed stoners in the business like Seth Rogen, Woody Harrelson, Jeff Bridges, Snoop Dogg, etc. I think one time Josheph Gordon-Levitt was on a talk show and mentioned meeting Rogen and how they got super high, and everyone just laughed. But isn't marijuana still illegal in most states and still a fucking drug? I mean, I smoke it too, so don't think I'm being a puritan or whatever. But it seems like these stoner celebrities get a free pass to do drugs and everyone just laughs it off despite the fact that they are pretty bad role models. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just watched this yesterday. I was expecting a movie about divorce, but that was not really the case. A Separation is mostly about the burden of taking care of an Alzheimer patient (and the filial piety it involves) and about the accusation that husband Nader pushed his father's caregiver down the stairs and caused her a miscarriage. This event is the real driving force behind the movie and takes up most of the plot. However, it's arguable how interesting this story would be had it not been for the setting. The movie's most intriguing aspect is the depiction of life in Iran and their oddly laid back criminal justice system. It's a world the western audience rarely gets to see and some of it may cause a culture shock that elicits various emotions. For example, at one point a character calls a Muslim hotline to find out if doing something would be a sin under certain circumstances, which is kind of hilarious, endearing and completely foreign all at once. Well acted as it was, I am not a fan of movies that are two hours of nonstop bickering and shouting, and I feel like the setting itself was the only (or major) reason why anybody even cares about this film. </TEXT>

<TEXT> La La Land: I would not call it an unhappy ending, because [both characters got everything they ever wanted, except that they did not end up together, which, ultimately, is perfectly ok.](#spoiler) It was bittersweet, sure, but hardly sad or unhappy.

Arrival: Since when do moody sci-fi films need to have a happy ending? Most of the good ones sure don't.

Overall: I think the lack of happy endings might be caused by:

* the predominantly pessimistic attitude prevalent in society right now

* the fact that some of these movies aimed to be realistic and real life rarely has happy endings

* the stereotypical Hollywood happy ending is actually lazy and escapist and serious filmmakers are doing something more interesting </TEXT>

Twelve OClock High was a big touchstone, for the feel and look of the aerial combat as well as the dynamic between the pilots, Johnson told Empire.

He continued: Three Outlaw Samurai for the feel of the sword-fighting, and the general sense of pulpy fun. And To Catch A Thief was a great film to rewatch, for the romantic scale and grandeur.

He liked aerial battles in one, swordfights and fun in another, and romance and grandeur in the third. None of that means there will be any similarities between those movies and Ep. VIII in terms of plot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> DS9's first two seasons were better than TNG's first two seasons, but yes, I agree with you OP that it got better when Worf and the Dominion came. However, I'm not a big fan of season 7, especially the last couple of episodes, which focused way too much the on Dominion war and the Pah Wraiths, to the point where supporting characters overshadowed the main characters. There was so much focus on Kai Winn, Bajoran Dukat, Damar, and even Gauron vs. Martok, while Sisko, Chief, Quark, Jake, Nog and to a large extent also Bashir and Odo had little to do.

<TEXT>  we only get one exposition dump, and that is explaining John himself

I don't even mind this exposition dump for two reasons:

* It's a reversal on the more common exposition dump, where the hero is told who the villain is. We are usually with the hero from the beginning and we get to know him. Very likely it follows the hero myth and there is a wise old man explaining about the villain directly to the hero. Here, John Wick is the hero (anti-hero, really) but he receives no explanations about anything. He is already established within the world of the film and knows his way around. On the other hand, a young criminal, who takes the role of the villain, is the one on a hero's journey, albeit a very misguided and amoral one. And he receives explanations about the hero from an older and wiser man. As I said, a reversal.

* It makes sense within the narrative of the movie that Iosef would not know that much about John Wick, because that business was before of his time. After all, Wick was already retired, seemingly for quite a while. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Random things that come out of the earth are assigned seemingly random values. The dirt isn't valued by anyone. We literally call it dirt. The same word we use to describe the foul, the unclean. And yet dirt is soil and that's where we get all the food. On the other hand, people have killed each other over pieces of diamonds or rubies, and yet they are made of carbon, or dirt. And even the value itself is assigned in contradicting ways. Diamonds and rubies are considered rare and finite in their numbers, which we celebrate by cutting them into polished pieces of precious rock on a wedding ring. Are you celebrating the beauty of the diamond or disrupting its natural form and depleting its reserves? A lump of carbon is considered precious because we want to have it in pleasing forms. A stalactite, though, is a lump of calcium, which is a more rare element, and is considered precious because we find it pleasing in its natural undisturbed form. Is it because the stones are shiny? </TEXT>

<TITLE> John Wick's world-building is so intriguing because the film is made like a sequel </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> John Wick has amazing action but the thing I like the most about it is how it expects the audience to keep up. There aren't obvious info-dump scenes and the dialogue is not awkwardly structured to explain things. And now it dawned on me that the writers did this so successfully by writing John Wick as if it were a sequel to a movie that doesn't exist.

The way certain scenes play out ("Noise complaint?" "Noise complaint.") or how certain characters meet (when the receptionist welcomes John Wick back at the hotel after a long absence) gives you a strong sense of history between everyone. It gives you a sense that this is a world that has been around for a while and you are given a glimpse of it sometime in the middle of its existence. But these scenes also feel like nods or references to a prior movie. Just try an imagine that there actually was a movie before John Wick and that the 2014 movie we know and love is its sequel. In it I picture a whole sequence with the cop that the "noise complaint" scene is referencing, winking at the audience ("Remember the last time the cop showed up because of a noise complaint?"). Like an easter egg for fans of the first movie. In sequels we often tend to cringe at these fan service nods, but in John Wick it works perfectly because we don't know what it is nodding to. It just lets us imagine what might have happened between them before, or who the cop really is, etc.

<TEXT> I assumed as much though I haven't read it. Still I don't think source material is an adequate excuse. You can always adapt it to suite your medium. A film is not a novel. Also, I don't know if the book is as disjointed as the movie, but the way I see it is that:

* either the book isn't very good to begin with and Affleck should have either changed things or just not adapt it at all,

* or the book was much better and Affleck screwed it up with a poor adaptation + terrible editing

Regardless of whether the book has the same problems as the film or not, it's still not a good film and things could have been done to fix that. I find it hard to believe that the man who made The Town and Argo would go to a theater to see Live By Night and consider it a good film.

<TEXT> It definitely sounds like way too much. I don't know if they meant this to be just for movie piracy or combined with music and TV, but it still sounds like a preposterously high number. But even if it were accurate, it's not like the industry is missing that money. It's not like studious are going bankrupt and actors are losing jobs because of torrents. People who will watch shitty cam versions or lower quality screeners are people who were not planning on paying for your movie even if it didn't show up on Pirate Bay. Either because they can't afford it, or the movie isn't available in their country, or they don't care about the movie enough to go to the cinema, or just on some dumb anti-establishment principle. Whichever is the case, you could say the studio isn't really losing money because they weren't going to earn it in the first place. If all pirating stopped, $20 billion would not suddenly pour into the market. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Live by Night is Affleck's weakest directorial effort, though this is not down to his abilities behind the camera. The movie is technically proficient and beautifully shot. Its main problems lie with Affleck's abilities behind a typewriter. His script lacks focus, switching from a Scorsese imitation gangster movie (complete with a Joe Pesci lookalike) to romantic, social and family drama without any balance between them. Certain scenes are either left out or skimmed over in favor of less interesting things and the dialogues often try to sound profound but usually fall flat. The film's terrible editing doesn't help to mitigate these issues, either. Even Affleck the actor is lacking in some respects. His bulky Batman physique, stern unmoving face and large immaculately pressed suits make him look like a mannequin posed among vintage cars and 1930s costumed extras. There are many things in Live by Night that could have worked and many things that could have been left out. A great movie is visible buried underneath the mess. Is there a script doctor in the house? </TEXT>

What kind of filmmakers will we have in 20 years if the future directors are watching Bourne and Taken? And what kind of audiences will we have? I heard 15-year-olds complain that Die Hard was boring and stupid because the action was so slow. They seem to want shaky cam and fast edits because that is all they get.

**Edit** Off topic, but relevant nonetheless: To a certain degree this also applies to jump scares in horror movies. Jump scares are lazy and they suck. But younger audiences find movies like The Sining, The Exorcist, or the more recent The Witch, boring because those films don't scare them by a dumb loud noise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How do you "not watch those movies" if you love the genre? I love action movies, sci fi, comic book movies. So what am I supposed to do? Just stop watching everything? Shaky cam is in so many things these days. Even fantasy. "Just don't watch those movies." is not the answer. "Just don't make shitty movies." is the answer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gatsby is literally a "Great American Novel" because it's, well, American - its author and setting are American. And it certainly put America on the literary map of the world, where it did not have much of a place before. This is what "Great American Novel" has come to mean.

Furthermore, the novel has a more sober view of the American dream. In the late 1800s and early 1900s the United States were a haven for immigrants who could start a new life. Poor Irish farmer with a starving family? Go to America, set up a business or get a big piece of land and become something more! It's what America was all about. But in Gatsby, the romantic American dream gets a more realistic and dark twist. Yes, America is the land of plenty and yes, you can go from rags to riches. But it does not buy you happiness or acceptance. You become a prisoner of it. And you still have to face the crowds of less fortunate people whose American dream did not come true. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically, a good non-spoilery, ambiguous trailer does at least one of these things:

- little to no dialogue from the movie (Girl With a Dragon Tattoo, The Force Awakens, Interstellar)

- either just one extended scene that pulls you in (American Sniper) or many inter-cut images that engage your attention (Girl With a Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl, The Handmaiden)

- memorable, standout music, which is either a song (Girl With a Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl, ) or the actual score from the movie (The Force Awakens)

- images that set the mood but are not actually from the movie (Alien, Interstellar)

<TEXT> In retrospect that trailer shows a lot, including the final chase and some other things that might be considered spoilers, but the way it's all presented without dialogue and with fast editing is perfect. People who've already read the book will pick up on those moments they glimpse in the footage and go "fuck yeah, that was that scene!" or "wow was that the guy from that scene?" while people who don't know the story will be confused and uniformed, but still engaged. </TEXT>

It's not like Hollywood executives will read his quote and immediately cancel all super hero movies currently in development. It's also not like Scott is infallible.

Maybe if the photographer at least took pictures of them in candid clothing and without makeup. These photos reveal absolutely nothing about these people.

<TEXT> The last network TV show I watched was Hannibal, which was excellent. All the other shows I used to watch were either drawn out too long or never really good to begin with. My girlfriend tried to convince me to watch How to Get Away With Murder, so I gave it a shot and turned it off during the third episode. There were just too many shitty characters, fake mysteries and tropes. I could just see them milking that shit with nonsensical revelations and twists for the next five seasons. It just seemed so network.

What do I watch? Game of Thrones, Westworld, The Affair, Sherlock, The Night Of, The Leftovers, Homeland, and Narcos.

Does ABC, CBS, CW, FOX, or NBC have anything really good to offer these days? Or should I just continue ignoring them? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The second half has two problems, I think. First, Starkiller base just randomly appears in the movie out of nowhere without any build up or a prior mention and just *suddenly* becomes a threat and a setpiece. The second problem is that everything that happens in Maz's palace feels kind of out of place and pointless. As I said before, the momentum of the movie simply stops when they get there. Then Rey's vision in the cellar happens in such an unexpected and jarring way that it feels like something from a different movie. Then Maz simply disapperas from the story because they cut her from later scenes in Leia's base and we don't get any resolution for those visions because they are a question for episode VIII. So Maz slows down the movie, vanishes without even a mention that she survived the attack on her palace and just leaves us with nothing but questions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For example, the Republic should have been developed in the movie. They probably cut it because they were afraid people wouldn't be interested. After all, everyone loves to bitch about senate debates and trade agreements in the prequels. Let's just keep any sort of politics out of our little New Hope remake. But then why the hell should I care about it getting blown up by Starkiller Base? Why do they even mention the Republic at all if the audience has no clue what role this political entity plays in this world at this time? They show us the Empire regrouped in the form of the First Order, but they don't show or clarify in any way what happened to the rest of the galaxy. That one [reaction shot of a seemingly random woman](http://imgur.com/a/kUa88) they inserted into that sequence just screams deleted scene. </TEXT>

<TEXT> With TFA I was just blown away by the movie more or less on the basis of "holy shit, I am watching a new Star Wars movie and it doesn't suck!" but as time went by, I began to recognize its flaws, such as the rehashed story, pacing issues, acting (I am not enthusiastic about Daisy Ridley) and a couple of missed opportunities (I think some of the deleted scene should have been left in the movie, [the final light saber fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdEIzRUos4g) , etc).

With Rogue One I immediately recognize its flaws (first half of the movie is riddled with issues) but I still get a shitload of enjoyment from it. It was better than TFA but neither are anywhere near perfect. It makes me wonder: What the hell is so hard about making a good Star Wars movie? 

Also, as a side note, that whole reshoots situation bothers me. There are so many things in the trailers that indicate a very different movie. What happened to that version? Will we ever know all the things they changed?  </TEXT>

She is still number one on most people's fap lists, she's a pretty big part of the MCU, she gets cool action roles but also more interesting projects like voice work in animation and Her, not to mention indie scifi Under the Skin. So I wouldn't dismiss JLaw so soon. She is still popular and young and she will get ton of work. It's up to her if she picks the right projects and retains her charm. </TEXT>

Of course, there is that giant orgy scene, but that's not what I mean. I've already seen some porn at that time so while fun to watch, the orgy is not what I remember the most. It was this secret sexy adult world that really got to me. Doctors getting to touch brautiful breast as their job, parents getting high in their room after they tuck in the kid, parties with OD'd naked hookers, a costume shop owner prostituting his daughter, secret sex rings, dark day dreams about your wife's adultery... Man, this movie is when I first realized that everything in the adult world revolves around sex.

<TITLE> Are practical effects coming back in earnest or are they used as a gimmick to attract audiences? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-23 11:03:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is not going to be an argument about practical being better than CG. Both have their place in modern filmmaking and I enjoy both when they are done well. That is beside the point. What I would like to discuss is whether practical effects (big sets and props, large scale stunt work, prosthetic makeup, models, etc) are making a real comeback or if they are the new gimmick like 3D was after Avatar came out.


Naturally I welcome the apparent resurgence of practical effects, but I always wonder if it's not just another marketing ploy. As far as I can tell, the productions that most blatantly publicise using practical effects are all sequels to beloved properties from the pre-CG era. Both The Force Awakens and Rogue One marketing campaigns have been very outspoken about going practical. However, it doesn't sound to me like the comeback of a filmmaking craft. It sounds more like these productions have something to prove and something to overcome. 'Look, you hated the overdone CG of the prequels, but don't worry, we're not doing that, so please buy tickets.' Perhaphs I'm too cynical about it, but the way they presented the practical effects in those ComicCon videos was definitely just pandering to fans of the originals.


Another example is Mad Max: Fury Road. It was made very obvious and very widely known how practical the action is in the movie. So much so that it resembled a marketing campaign in itself. Thosebehind-the-scenesvideos that came out showing stunt tests and pre-color graded footage served as trailers for the spectacle you would get in the theater. Again I got the sense that these filmmakers are saying 'This won't be another CG action movie, so buy tickets for our practical fun!' So many 1980s properties have been revisited with sequels and reboots and so many of them were bad in part due to the modern sensibilities of their filmmaking. Was anyone back in the day pining for a scene where John McClane jumps onto the wing of a jet fighter while it destroys a highway overpass? Was there anyone impatiently waiting for the technology to catch up to this essential vision of what that character could do? No. John McClane is a regular guy and that shit is just not realistic. Just like the CG in that scene didn't look realistic at all. So is Fury Road a demonstration of how to make a better movie or is it simply a demonstration of how not to ruin your 80s franchise?


Jurassic World used some practical puppets and its sequel is set to utilize them even more. In fact, I know more about the intent to use animatronics in JW2 than I know about the story or cast of that movie. Why is that? Are we so sick of CG or so eager to see the jerky movements of puppets we grew up with in Spielberg's original? Is this reemergence of practical effects just a new way of pandering to our nostalgia or is it a real, honest to god return of a filmmaking technique?


Then we have movies like A Monster Calls, which I haven't seen yet but I already read five articles about its practical effects. It's like using anything else beside computers is an oddity that needs to be reported and scrutinized.Yesterday I watched Krampus and that movie is surprisingly loaded with practical effects. People in masks and costumes instead of CG critters. It was what The Thing should have done in 2011. (I honestly think the decision to scrap those wonderful practical effects completely ruined what could have been a very effective and scary prequel.) However, some of those Krampus masks are so obviously fake that again I have to wonder what it's trying to say. Is it an honest (if a little unconvincing) effort to do practical effects or is it just some on the nose retro call back that was purposefully done a little bit too fake so that we would notice it and recall some cheap 80s movies from our childhood? Are movies just movies these days or is everything about them winking at the audience?

<TEXT> copying my review from /r/movies here if that is ok

The pros:

- They perfectly captured the look and feel of the original Star Wars world, which is both futuristic and ancient, sleek and gritty. And they expanded upon it perfectly with new locations, aliens, weapons, etc.

- The visuals are astounding. Beautiful cinematography and VFX. And all those wonderful designs! Darth Vader's hideout looked like something straight from Ralph McQuarie's sketchbook and all the aliens were neat.

- There was less fan service and nostalgia pandering compared to The Force Awakens (though it was definitely present)

- The ending was perfect. It did not shy away from character deaths and it tied things up wonderfully, leaving us where Ep. IV starts.

- We finally get to see Darth Vader kick some serious ass. You know which scene I mean. He was fucking terrifying. 

- We also see a lot more of the Empire

- Ben Mendelhson stole the show for me along with Donnie Yen. 

- The score felt very much like a Star Wars score.

The cons:

- The story is a bit all over the place and the pacing is off. The first half of the movie feels at odds with the beach planet finale. I think Rogue One could easily have been 20 minutes shorter and better paced without losing any important story beats.

- Neither the script nor the acting are perfect although neither gets anywhere near the high prequel levels of cringe.

In summary:

- Rogue One is a visual feast which captures the Star Wars feel perfectly. It serves as a great proof of concept for these standalone anthology films.

- It is not without issues of script and pacing, but these issues don't detract much from the overal very positive experience.

PS: Please excuse bad English and misspelled actor names.

<TEXT> I think it's one of those situations where you simply can't please everyone. I'm happy this wasn't the Vader show. The filmmakers didn't blow their geek load and made something new with a new villain instead of fulfilling what I'm sure was their childhood dream when they played with Vader action figures. If this was the Vader show, people would complain they just rehashed stuff and didn't do anything new. Too much Vader would be bad and apparently too little Vader is bad too. But I really think they used him in just the right way. His first scene tied nicely with the prequels (the setting on Mustafar plus the fact that he was still in the healing process) and the second scene showed us what we always wanted to see. Why do more? Sure, it's always cool to see him, but on the other hand he's kind of sacred and what if they messed him up? 

As for the Tarkin thing...I don't know if that needed any major explaining. The Empire is a military operation and a relatively young new Sith Lord can't be expected to lead a whole big operation, especially since he seems to spend most of his time on Mustafar doing weird Vader shit. In Ep. IV Tarkin is there to keep him in check, I think, and supervise him for the Emperor.  </TEXT>

- Ben Mendelhson stole the show for me along with Donnie Yen. 

- The score felt very much like a Star Wars score.

The cons:

- The story is a bit all over the place and the pacing is off. The first half of the movie feels at odds with the beach planet finale. I think Rogue One could easily have been 20 minutes shorter and better paced without losing any important story beats.

- Neither the script nor the acting are perfect although neither gets anywhere near the high prequel levels of cringe.

In summary:

- Rogue One is a visual feast which captures the Star Wars feel perfectly. It serves as a great proof of concept for these standalone anthology films.

- It is not without issues of script and pacing, but these issues don't detract much from the overal very positive experience.

PS: Please excuse bad English and misspelled actor names.

<TEXT> Jeremy Renner was not the problem with that movie, though. The movie was its own problem, in a way. It felt very much like someone took an unrelated standalone spy movie and rewrote a couple of things to stick the Bourne label on it and make another movie in that franchise.  A Bourne movie should have Bourne in it. It's right there in the title of that film. There is no logical reason for doing a Bourne movie without Bourne other than to cash in on the brand recognition. Whether people would stomach Bourne being played by someone else other than Damon is another issue. 

The M:I movies don't have Ethan Hunt in their titles. So on this very basic level it would make sense to do a M:I movie without Hunt. There could be a whole new IMF team. They could even set it in the sixties and make it about the cold war. They could do what Star Trek did - have different teams in different periods and locations. Or there could be a M:I movie with Ethan Hunt played by someone else, but again, the question is how would audiences react to seeing a different actor take that name.

Of course, the Bond movies recast their main character. But it's something the franchise is know for. Ever since I can remember there have always been discussions on who would be a good Bond, whether it was just wishful thinking or actual casting rumors. I have never seen anyone discuss who would make a good Bourne or Hunt. People are used to the fact that Bond gets recast because it has already happened a couple of times and the franchise is what, 60 years old by now? I don't know what the reaction was when Connery was recast, but by now people are simply used to the fact that Bond gets recast every now and then. It is a very unique characteristic of this particular franchise.  </TEXT>

He's been less and less outspoken about his religion for years, he has no recent sex scandals or any other BS like that and despite his practically unbroken streak of success he isn't difficult to work with. In fact he is pretty well known for being a very hard worker who always gives his best. </TEXT>

The iPad has her thumbprint on it physically? Yeah, I guess so, along with a couple other of her finger print and Sisko's too, since he touched it as well. But I suppose you meant that she scanned her thumbprint and attached it to the document as a sort of verification. So it has a digital thumbprint, which could be sent along with her resignation as an email. No sense in physically giving a whole iPad to someone so it could be sent to Starfleet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know what you mean but I find it difficult to agree. Pacific Rim and Godzilla both had great spectacle but neither feel like great movies, and this is due to their characters. If you are fidgeting during a film and only waiting for the big FX scenes to finally start then the film is a failure in terms of storytelling, a mere vessel for the few minutes of CG. Compare that to a movie like Aliens. You go in wanting to see more of that great scary alien and the spectacular violence and action. But you find yourself enjoying the entire hour before an alien even shows up because of the great characters. That makes the entire movie enjoyable and memorable, instead of just something you have to sit through to see a chest burster or the Queen vs Powerlifter fight. That's a scene that is elevated to perfection by the fact that you care about Ripley and her need to save Newt and destroy the alien. Godzilla has great designs, great effects, cool shots and exciting fights, but think about how much better all those things could have been if you gave a shit about the world those fights are happening in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am watching DS9 for the first time and the other day I realized something that is also true for TNG, which I watched two years ago. Despite all the incredible technology available to these characters, nobody seems to have a USB drive or wifi (nobody seems to have the sci-fi equivalents of these things, at any rate). I was watching the episode where Dax falls in love with a mam from a planet that shifts into a non-corporeal dimension and she was going to leave the normal world to go with him. So she writes her resignation from Starfleet on her iPad and then she hands the whole iPad to Sisko asking him to make sure Starfleet gets it. So what exactly is going to happen here? Is Sisko going to *mail the whole iPad* to HQ? Doesn't Starfleet have email? In another episode, Odo is investigating an explosion in Garak's shop and he meets a Cardassian Deep Throat informant. This informant gives Odo a list of names by literally handing him a tablet-like device which Odo then takes back to DS9 to investigate. Do these people have an unlimited supply of tablets that they give away any time they need to share a simple .txt file? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I watched Godzilla again. Despite its flaws I find it to be a very rewatchable movie. In fact, I suspect it will become one of those movies I'll always watch when they're on, like Independence Day or Deep Blue Sea. I can think of few movies from the 21st century that are so rewatchable in this entertaining, non-commital way. But there is one thing that bothers me big time about Godzilla and it's those bland, dumb, boring characters. 

What were they thinking when they cast Ken Watanabe, a very popular and very awesome Japanese actor, only to give him *nothing* to work with? All he ever does is stare off into the distance with a hollow look of shock. This becomes so ridiculous so fast. One of these days I'll make a compilation of nothing but shots of Watanabe staring. And what were they going for with Elisabeth Olsen's character? Love interest? Damsel of distress? Strong female character? Plot device to give Aaron Taylor Johnson's character some personal stakes? This talented actress is barely in the movie and I'm prone to forget all about the character's existence immediately after one of her short pointless scenes ends. Is there a whole character arc they had to cut from the movie to save time? (Or because the studio wanted to favor monster action instead? I don't know, I'm clutching at straws here.) I find it hard to believe that someone simply wrote a non-character like this and Olsen's agent thought it would be a great idea for her to play it. And ATJohnson is clearly capable of a good performance (see Nocturnal Animals) but he is so boring in Godzilla. I'm not that big of a Brian Cranston fan and I thought it was a bold choice to kill him off in the middle of the movie, but for heaven's sake, at least have someone remotely interesting to cary the rest of your film! What happened with this script?

I really hope the next movies in this monster universe will have better characters and not waste their great cast (Kong, you better have something good in store for Brie Larson!) and I seriously hope that Garreth Edwards is capable of much better character work and I won't have to repeat this rant after seeing Rogue One. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It feels like I've already heard this type of song in other modern sci-fi movies of varying quality. It sounds exactly the way I thought it would. I am not saying that the music is bad, I actually like it, but simply sounds like other soundtracks. This could easily be an unused M83 song from Oblivion.

On the other hand, Arrival, for example, has a soundtrack that is so jarringly different from things we've heard before in mainstream sci-fi movies. That is a soundtrack that helps build an aura of mystery, wonder, and the unexpected around the mysterious and wondrous images of the film. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What are your favorite examples of the "show, don't tell" approach to storytelling? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-28 08:52:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I hate it when movies have unnaturally sounding dialogue filled with exposition that is only there to inform the audience about something. To me that is lazy writing, lazy filmmaking and it just screams 'infodump for the dumb audience' in a way that takes me out of the movie completely. I understand that certain things simply need to be said and explained, but at the same time so many things can be shown instead of told. After all, movies are a visual medium.

Like the other day I was watching Frailty and at the very beginning there is a shot at a parking space reserved for Agent Doyle. A man parks there and gets out of the car and you immediately know he is an FBI agent, probably high ranking since he has his own parking space, and you know his name. It's a stupid, small thing, but it's so much better than this:

Person A: "Hello, man who is going to introduce me to the audience."

Person B: "Oh, hi there. As you know, you are special agent Doyle with the fancy parking spot."

So what are your favorite examples of "show, don't tell"? It could be a little thing.  </TEXT>

One is a dark sci-fi survival horror movie with a metaphorical monster in it (a walking phallic symbol set on raping people with its equally phallic dick mouth) and the other is a lighter action movie with a perfect depiction of a military unit fighting monsters and shooting shit with an exploration of motherhood as the cherry on top </TEXT>

<TEXT> This doesn't happen to me very often but I'm simply lost with this movie. It was entertaining, well acted, and I liked the structure of the story. But I just didn't get the plot about Living Robotics at all. Here are a couple of questions I have:

* Why did John Lithgow's character call the accountant if he was behind the financial machinations all along? What did he hope to achieve? (especially when he immediately decided to assassinate him and Anna Kendrick's character)

* What were the financial machinations anyway?

* Why did Lithgow have his associates killed?

* Who was the man in the car whom Jon Bernthal's character threatened? Was that relevant to the plot or was it just an introduction of who Bernthal is?

* Was I supposed to be shocked when it was revealed that Bernthal is the accountant's younger brother? I thought that was the only obvious part of the movie.

Thanks for the help uncooking the books on this movie

<TEXT>  There are no other arcs besides the ones completed by the end when Johnny gets his girl back.

Well, I don't know, maybe I was wrong to call them character arcs, but I do think there's more going on than just Rico and Carmen's relationship. All the characters have their significant moments and go through changes. For example:

* There is the love triangle. Dizz wants Rico more than he wants her and Rico wants Carmen more than she wants him. Rico tells Carmen he loves her and she can't say it back and then later Dizz says she loves Rico but he can't say it back, putting himself in both Carmen's and Dizz's shoes, which is an interesting realization for him. 

* At the start of the movie, Rico can't make up his own mind and does stuff to please others. By the end of the movie he comes into his own and becomes a decisive and respected leader.

* Ace wants to be a career soldier and a leader of men, but after he freezes up during battle without being able to lead other (which is when Rico steps in) he realizes that leadership is not for him and he refuses a promotion later on because he's no longer vain and knows his limits.

* Zim accepts a demotion because he wants to go into battle instead of staying at home as a drill instructor. He finds actual battle more honorable than preparing others for battle while staying safe and he becomes a hero, justifying his decision to become a regular private.

* At the start of the movie, Carl is a nerd who makes telepathic research in his mom's basement. By the end of the movie he becomes a more powerful telepath and a high-ranking intelligence officer with a lot of power.

* Carmen is pretty vain and very sheltered in her cushy job as a pilot, seeing flying as some grand adventure. But later she gets to experience the horrors of the bug war first hand when she thinks Rico is dead, then she witnesses her captain's violent death and then she encounters the brain bug and gets injured.

<TEXT> A lack of proper sexual education (and the resulting lack understanding of one's own body) might also be a factor. IIRC the documentary [This Film Is Not Yet Rated](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493459/) deals with these issues and it makes a pretty interesting point about depiction of sex and especially orgasms. Showing a woman climaxing is considered a bigger taboo than a showing a man climaxing, which I think the documentary explains by female orgasms somehow being more "mysterious" in people's eyes. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  For me, Starship Troopers is just a terrible adaption. Fundamentally the filmmakers didn't get the source material, if I remember correctly the director at one point said the book was dreadful.

A book and a movie can function as separate entities without the movie copying the book. I totally get your frustration if you are a fan of the book, of course, but sometimes a movie can be good on its own while only interpreting the book and taking only certain stuff from it. Just look at Kubrick's The Shining. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the rating system differentiates certain types of violence and its context, so when a cop shoots a bad guy, it's less "dangerous" than a scene where violence is glorified or made to look like fun. As for language and nudity, those MPAA guys are stuck in Victorian England mode. Very, very prudish. But even language and nudity are differentiated based on some rules and context. For example, nudity in a completely non-sexual context is more ok than sex.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  super violent R rated movies like Die Hard and Terminator

Were they violent? Sure, there was shooting and some blood. But were they exceptionally violent? Not really, or at least not more so than other action movies or even some PG13 films. I think their R rating was for language and nudity more than for violence.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really wanted to like this movie but it did turn out to be pretty meh. The standout thing for me was Cobie Smulders' performance. What a great, charismatic, strong female character. I hope she continues playing badasses and get more big roles. Cruise was also ok. He never phones it in, but I wouldn't say he was amazing. Smulders outshone him, in my opinion. I also thought the girl was ok, although this is very subjective for me, because she really reminded me of a colleague I had and it was just fun to imagine her in those situations.

Unfortunately what really stood out to me was the poor action and terribly generic score.

I don't remember the book that much because I usually read the Lee Child novels in two or three days because they are such a blast. But I am pretty sure they changed a couple of things and I'm not sure those changes were for the better. If anyone remembers the book, care to elaborate on the differences? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Keating's students are there to be educated on poetry.

The way I see it, most of them don't really care about poetry to begin with. As I recall, the school is some sort of Ivy League prep school or something that gets you to awesome law schools and stuff. They are in that particular classroom to learn about poetry but they are not at that particular school to learn about poetry. I don't think they care about poetry or find it interesting, especially the way they were taught just the theory from a thick book by a boring professor. At least Keating got them fired up for poetry a little bit, otherwise they would've just memorized theory, passed a test and moved on. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As someone who's only really seen the Star Wars movies and never ventured among the spin-offs and extended canon, I cannot wait to see Rogue One for one simple reason: 

I want to see the Galactic Empire be evil on a relatable scale.

They are undoubtedly evil and fascist not only in their actions but also in their historical inspiration. But so far in the movies they have committed mostly large scale destruction and warlike skirmishes. It was mostly impersonal and epic. I'm hoping that in Rogue One we'll see them more on a grounded level. I want to see how they treat and oppress the planets they invaded. I want to see their patrols and their arrests. An Imperial prison, maybe. I want to see their propaganda. I want to know if the Empire uses propaganda or if they are so ruthless that they don't care about the hearts and minds at all, instead they just crush without any need of winning anyone over.

So far the trailers for Rogue One have all looked amazing and even though I feel like the latest one revealed a bit too much of the plot (especially compared to the The Force Awakens trailers) I'm still craving to see even more. This just might be the gritty Star Wars I always wanted to see. One that follows Stormtroopers around the corner and shows us what they do to the street, so to speak. I expect that even if the movie disappoints, I will be on the apologetic side of the argument praising its visuals and depiction of the Empire as something to be fearful of.

I'm not a huge fan of winter, but please let it be December already. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Chan-wook Park's new movie The Handmaiden is a masterfully crafted slow-burning erotic thriller </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-29 09:06:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The only other movie I've seen by Korean director Chan-wook Park is Oldboy, which needs no introduction here on reddit. But brilliant as that movie was, I definitely have a new favorite by which I will measure Chan-wook Park's other movies from now on. (EDIT: I've also seen Stoker but forgot it's by him)

The Handmaiden is gorgeous to look at, with lavish sets, costumes, and crisp cinematography. Through it's sparsity of shots and clarity of composition the story is told in a series of beautiful images. I feel like after watching (and re-watching and studying) all of the Every Frame a Painting videos (and other similar channels) my standards of what makes a movie well shot went up significantly. I believe The Handmaiden ticks all the boxes in terms of visual storytelling. There is a balance between showing and telling and none of the boring shot-reverse-shot style we see in lazier cinema (I am looking at you, Spotlight, you bland piece of TV movie!). Chan-wook Park is clearly a master filmmaker.

I will not talk about the plot so as not to spoil anything, but let's just say a handmaiden is hired to take care of the rich niece of a weirdo book collector and nothing is what it seems. 

The story is divided into three parts, each revealing a new twist and a new point of view.  The characters are intriguing and I cared about the outcome of the story more than in any other movie I've seen this year. Betrayal, love, longing for freedom, and (graphic) sexuality are the main thematic elements of the movie and while I certainly wouldn't call it a heist movie, there is a criminal element at work that will make this genre mix intriguing for a wider audience. 

If you haven't seen this movie, you have my sincere recommendation to do so at first opportunity. If you have seen it, please recommend me others like it. I really need to explore Korean films more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just watched a couple of video essays on action movies and to sum up, good action should include:

- a story

- characters and stakes

- forward momentum for the plot

- wide shots, not too many cuts

- clarity and steady shots

- a good antagonist and a good hero


Are these what you look for in a good action movie? What are your favorite action movies and the best action scenes and why?

<TITLE> In anticipation of "Hacksaw Ridge" I revisited Gibson's previous movie "Apocalypto" after ten years and it's so much better than I remembered </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-10 14:17:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The direction in Apocalypto is crazy good. At first glance the movie might sound like a disaster: unfamiliar actors, foreign language, simplistic plot, weird genre mix, etc. But Gibson turns this into a fantastic action packed ride with a likable hero and big emotional stakes.

I have no idea how historically accurate it is, but Apocalypto sure as hell feels authentic thanks to the great camera work, costumes, sets, realistic violence and very well shot action. After ten years of CGI bullshit, shaky camera and ADD editing, this movie is a revelation in terms of how the action is presented. Gibson seems to have that shit down to a T and I cannot wait to see what he'll bring to the screen in Hacksaw Ridge with the insanity of WWII battles. Hollywood really needs to forget and forgive Gibson's vices and embrace his virtues because this dude can direct action like few other people today and we really need that right now.

One interesting fact I noticed about the plot of Apocalypto is that it follows a very similar story structure seen in Mad Max Fury Road. In both movies we get a short introduction to the world and characters before the action kicks in, and then everything is on the move to one place before it all reverses and returns to where it started. In fact, if I had to describe this movie to someone, I'd probably tell them it's a combination of Fury Road and Predator with South American Indians. </TEXT>

I remember many interviews where actors say they like villainous roles because of the depth and acting challenge it gives them. The bad guys are cool and the dark side always seems to have a certain appeal. But who is your favorite straight up good guy (or girl)? Who does a good job of playing a heroic role?

My choice is definitely Sigourney Weaver and her Ripley character from the Alien franchise. </TEXT>

But your pick doesn't have to be an action sequence or anything from a thriller. Comedies do night clubs a lot as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love The Mission. It is such a beautiful movie. The scenery, cinematography, the music! I am looking for something similar, a feast for the senses, but also with a good story and acting. Preferably something historic, but from any period. It doesn't have to be about South America. 

Suggestions of older movies, underrated, less known or obscure would be great. I have seen many mainstream movies. If it's in a Top 10 somewhere, I've probably seen it. Foreign movie suggestions welcome!

<TITLE> Four months ago I posted an infographic about the Solar System that got a couple thousand upvotes. Now I'm redesigning it as a website and I was wondering if any like-minded space enthusiast would be interested in turning it into a functioning site. (images in description) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-05 16:12:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I decided to turn [this infographic](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/3t5x0k/to_help_promote_at_least_a_basic_understanding_of/) into a website. I started doing it as design practice and maybe something I could put into a portfolio one day, but I figured I might as well share it with you fellow space enthusiasts and find out if anyone would want to collaborate on this project and maybe even code the site (pro bono, I'm afraid). [Here are two pages (work in progress, but nearly finished) as an example.](http://imgur.com/a/1Eidx)

What do you think?

**EDIT:** I already got some responses here and in PMs so let me elaborate a bit on what I am proposing here, as there were a couple similar questions in the messages.

- I would like to do this at the absolute minimal cost possible. This is purely a free-time project for me, a marriage of my interest in space with my aspirations as a designer.

- I have next to no clue what it takes to turn a graphic design into a functioning website. I assume this would be a fairly simple html site as there are no special animations or whatever (maybe some hover effects, but I don't know yet, the design is a work in progress right now). I also assume some sort of server has to bet up for webhosting and purchasing a domain?

- I know the domain seen in the pictures is taken. Suggestions are welcome.

- I am looking for someone who could take my finished PSD files and program them into a website and set up the webhosting, etc. The technical side of things. As I want to use this as part of my graphic portfolio, I would like to be the one solely responsible for the design, so I am not looking for help on the visual front (though suggestions and feedback are of course welcome!)

- If you would like to contribute some (fun) facts or fact-check the content, that would also be cool.

Thank you so much for the early response and I will get to your messages later for sure. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> That scene where he operates on himself, that is why Matt Damon is nominated for an Oscar. In fact, the sequence starting when he wakes up after the accident and ending when he realizes he is fucked, that is a motherload of amazing acting. He perfectly conveys a near-future reality, where a scenario like this might happen. It would be the Apollo 13 of our time, but much worse. Damon is at the forefront of this reality, showing us a man stranded on a beautiful alien world and at the same time, thanks to the movie's moments of lightheartedness, showing us a man coping with this reality very well. He very effectively portrays the moments when Whatney's training kicks in, when he is at his most confident and efficient, to moments that are utterly human and show us his uncontrollable isolation and also optimism. To me it is an outstanding performance this year and also a bold new choice for the Academy, that is, to nominate an actor in a leading role from a sci-fi movie. </TEXT>

What a weird amazing movie.

A 21 year-old Tom Cruise dressed in buttoned shirts looked nothing like a high school kid, but other than that I really enjoyed his performance. The famous dance scene was fun, but I was surprised by the rest of the movie and I think that scene is really out of place in it. I find it odd that this is the thing the movie is most remembered by (or associated with). </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is there no love for Jurassic Park 3? The set pieces, general entertainment value, and stand-alone originality should be enough to redeem it. [Spoilers for the movie] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-28 15:10:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Over Christmas I realized that I have never seen Jurassic Park 3 properly from start to finish. I can't fathom why I didn't go see it when it came out in 2001, since I was the perfect age to enjoy it back then (I was 12) and over the years I only caught parts of it on TV. I've always been aware that it's considered the worst Jurassic Park sequel (I think that's still the case now when we have four JP movies) and that it has a low rating on imdb (5.9). But three days ago I gave it a shot, thinking that even if it's really that bad, at least I'll finally know why. And after three days I still find myself thinking about the movie and the more I do, the more I'm convinced Jurassic Park 3 deserves a second chance. I'm going to list the things I liked and leave out some of its problems as I'm sure they will be mentioned by nay-sayers in the comments. Let me just make it clear that i don't think JP3 is flawless by any means. I just think it's much much better than it is given credit for.

JP3 takes the Aliens route of being much more action packed and showing much more of the dinosaurs than its predecessors and basically becomes an action movie instead of an adventure movie (similarly to how Cameron switched genres from monster horror to action and showed us all those aliens instead of keeping them scary and in the dark). And why not? After two movies, the Spielbergian awe and wonder has faded and it would be pointless to try and recapture it (to imitate it, really) so instead JP3 goes all out. Unlike Jurassic World, this movie doesn't rely on nostalgia and apart from bringing back old characters (more on that later) it does its own thing. There is a new setting (well, the jungle looks the same, but at least it's a different island and we don't visit old locations) and a new dino kicks the T-Rex's ass instead of having it save the day again. Is this why JP3 has such a bad rep? Because it isn't JP enough?

I like the way they bring back Dr. Alan Grant. Having seen the dinosaurs up close and having rejected them as terrifying genetic mutants that are only a lab tech's facsimile of what a dino really was, he sticks tightly to his old school methods. He digs the dirt and dusts the bones. I think this makes perfect sense for the character. Later on the kid they went to save tells Grant he read both of his books, but liked the first one better because Grant "still liked dinosaurs when he wrote it." I loved that bit of characterization and I would be hard-pressed to pinpoint anything remotely as deep in Jurassic World. (Here I should add a little disclaimer: I might diss JW a bit in this post, but it's not meant to be a JW dissing post and I actually enjoyed JW a lot, for various different reasons.) It's also a neat touch that Grant didn't end up together with Ellie and that his inability to talk about anything else besides his work lead Ellie's child to label him The Dinosaur Man. Again, it's a nice bit of characterization. Grant is so engrossed in his work that he has no life outside of it and his only hope in life seems to be training his assistant Billy to continue with his work. Naturally, when another rich guy comes waving a big check under his nose to fund the work, Grant can't help it but accept. He has nothing else.

Another part of the movie that I enjoyed is the plot itself. It's a small scale rescue mission, as opposed to the big semi-military operation of The Lost World, which again reminded me of the Alien franchise (where the Weyland-Yutani company insists on capturing a xenomorph and bringing it home, which is, naturally, the worst idea ever). In fact, the movie comes to an abrupt end as soon as everyone is rescued, because that was what the movie was about. There is no attempt to set up a sequel and no unnecessary multiple endings. The drive of the story is not to go see or capture dinosaurs, but simply to rescue a stranded kid (who magically manages to survive on the island for a very long time, totally like Newt in Aliens) and that is an original idea within the confines of this franchise. Again, JP3 is doing its own thing, which I appreciate. In fact, the movie leads you to believe there is something bigger going on, when really there isn't. Mr. and Mrs. Kirby are just regular people looking for their kid and their hired mercenary is just some guy who is capable of looking tough for limited periods of time. Even Billy, when he steals the raptor eggs, is not doing so for some evil corporation, but simply because he wants more dinosaurs to study.

JP3's biggest problem is that it turns the dinosaurs into monsters where Spielberg depicted them as simply animals going about their animal business. Here we have intelligent raptors communicating with each other and setting up traps (it is mentioned that they might have been even more intelligent than primates) and even engaging in some weird Mexican stand off/hostage situation with the eggs. But even this weirdness can be explained off. JP3 is simply a movie presenting a theory. Grant goes out of his way to convince his peers that raptors had large brains and organs allowing them to communicate with sounds. I'm no paleontologist so who am I to disagree with this theory that Grant seems to have covered with fossils as evidence? And then it turns out he was right and the movie shows us what those smarter-than-we-previously-thought dinosaurs might be like. Why the hell not? In fact the set pieces in this movie were great and the dinosaur action mostly holds up very well. There are tons of practical effects and the CG (mostly) isn't shabby and the editing isn't all over the place and the camera isn't shaky. For example, the fight between the T-Rex and that other big dino that kicks its ass was great. I loved how it was staged under the jungle canopy, just two pissed off animals fighting over food (in this case our characters) and I think that scene really gave a good sense of how those prehistoric battles might have looked like. There are many thrills in this movie and unlike Hammond's park ride, in JP3 there is no danger of not seeing the money shots. And let's face it, when we go see the third Jurassic park movie, what we really want to see is the money shots, right? Was anyone expecting it to be Shakespeare? 

**TL;DR:** I enjoyed JP3 more than most people seem to have. I think it continues Grant's story nicely, I like the action and I appreciate the movie for doing its own thing instead of going for nostalgia or imitating Spielberg. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So the quote goes like this: "Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself."

But why can't people simply be told? I sort of understand what Morpheus is going for here - seeing is believing. Why would you believe someone if they told you that the world is a digital simulation from a dystopian future ruled by robots? But that is beside point. He could tell you and whether you believe him or not is your problem. The thing that bugs me is that he won't tell you what the Matrix is until you disconnect from it, by which time it's kind of too late for you anyway. Morpheus is sort of an asshole, is he not?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> After 16 years, FIGHT CLUB feels very out-dated but also very relevant [SPOILERS] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-01 11:17:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yesterday, I had the opportunity to see **Fight Club** for the first time in the cinema with an audience. All my previous viewings (I think I saw it five times) were on TV/DVD and alone. It was a great experience, the audience enjoyed it very much, there was a lot of laughter and spontaneous cheering at the end. It is a movie I would definitely recommend seeing with a group of people on a big screen. It was also the first time I watched it in a couple of years (I can't even remember when exactly did I watch it the last time). And there were a couple of things I noticed about **Fight Club** that were surprising, enjoyable, but also disappointing.

In my formative high-school years I was a big fan of Chuck Palahniuk. I thought he was the coolest, smartest, most edgy writer out there and of course the movie blew me away with its cool, smart and edgy style. Nowadays it all feels very 90s to me. The voiceover narration in particular felt forced sometimes, with Edward Norton's dry voice delivering one-liners that no longer struck me as poignant commentary or intriguing observations. The lines felt like nothing but sentences that were once edgy paragraphs in a book we all grew out of. That post-modern, post-whatever nihilistic grit that the movie is drenched in felt like watching an old music video on MTV that no longer impresses with its stylized loathing of everything that is clean and popular. If I were to compare this movie to Fincher's later work, especially the cynical and satyrical **Gone Girl**, then **Fight Club** feels like the awkward rebellious teenager and **Gone Girl** is the adult that prefers not to think of its embarrassing former self.

**Spoiler** territory here, in case you haven't noticed the title. There is something about that famous twist that feels out-dated as well. I don't think I can properly put into words exactly what I mean about that, though. I think maybe audiences nowadays would see straight through it and realize much sooner that Edward Norton's narrator and Tyler Durden are the same person. Watching **Fight Club** with hindsight, the clues are so obvious and numerous that I can't decide what was Fincher going for with all that foreshadowing. Did he think his audience was too stupid and wouldn't notice them? Or did he think his audience was too clever and needed the clues to accept the absurdity of the twist? Which is the correct question to ask: "How could Norton be Durden?" or "How could Norton *not* be Durden?"

But don't think I dislike the movie. On the contrary. Somehow, despite my criticisms and negative observations, I think I never liked it more than I do now. I can't really explain it. Despite its out-dated style, which at best induces 90s nostalgia and at worst is cringe-worthy, **Fight Club** still feels very relevant. Its themes are still applicable, even more so than in 1999, and I long to know what Tyler Durden would do about our smartphone driven obsession with selfies, retweets and facebook likes. What of all the ridiculous fashions and trends, like hipsters, insta-filters, and everything being retro as if desperately trying to escape our modern times while at the same time fueling them with more and more ridiculous and abstract consumerism. I am Jack's evolved sense of style, but I'm also Jack's subconscious yearning for revolution.

<TITLE> I rewatched Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and maybe you should too [SPOILERS, obviously] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-19 20:47:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I don't think anyone truly loves Crystal Skull but I do think many people truly hate it. Back in '08 it was a big disappointment for me and I haven't watched it since. Until last night. And I was surprised to see that it's not actually half as bad as I remembered it to be. (But still not good, though.)

Unfortunately, the movies starts badly. Even the very first shot is anti-climactic and dumb. When you go see an Indiana Jones movie you expect the Paramount logo to seamlessly transform into the first shot of the film and Crystal Skull opts to do this in a totally irrelevant and childish fashion with a CG chipmunk. Then a brief, totally irrelevant car chase follows and abruptly ends when the plot of the movie finally kicks in. Indiana Jones is then betrayed by his long-time friend and war-time colleague Mac and this betrayal unfortunately feels irrelevant as well, because we have no emotional attachment to their relationship. We actually find out that they worked together for years *after* he betrays Indy. So automatically I just don't care. The following action sequence in the warehouse is pretty good, though, right up until that controversial moment when Indy survives the nuke in the fridge. Is it dumb and unbelievable? Yes, of course it is. Does it bother me? No, not really. First of all, Indy has survived some impossible shit before and it's not like these movies have any sort of realism attached to them. Second, more dumber things happen later in the movie, so by comparison the fridge is actually a neat gag. Those forced chipmunk jokes... that's another matter.

I like the setting of the movie and the fact that Indy is a war hero and former spy. It is exactly the sort of career I would expect him to have between WWII and 1954. After all, he hates Nazis. I also really like that he continued teaching, a role he probably secretly enjoys more than his macho adventurer nature allows him to admit. The McCarthy commie witch hunt commentary in the movie is a bit forced but forgivable and it helps to show just how much Indy lives to be a professor. I even really enjoyed the chase scene between Indy and Mutt on the chopper and the two commie agents in the car. Which brings me to another unpopular part of the movie. Mutt.

Think what you will of Shia LaBeouf. I personally don't care what actors do IRL when I watch a movie. That is why I'm able to enjoy Tom Cruise in pretty much anything despite the fact that he's a crazy Scientologist. And also why I still love Mel Gibson's movies. So putting his recent behavior aside, LaBeouf is actually pretty good in the movie, playing a good-guy greaser who's anxious to save his family and recruits Indy on his mission, for which he himself is quite ill equipped. They make a pretty good duo and the movie excellently treads that fine line between letting Mutt do some action stuff for which Indy is a bit old and at the same time not stealing Indy's spotlight or making him obsolete. I also really enjoyed their relationship before Indy finds out he is Mutt's father. Indy is just and older, experienced, world-weary but ultimately chilled out guy stuck with an eager kid and he just casually gives him some wisdom and talks to him the same way a cool estranged uncle might. It's a buddy movie and it kinda works. But after Indy finds out that he is Mutt's father, there are some dumb jokes ("finish school, young man") and they loose that casual buddy rapport, which is a shame.

Most of the really problematic parts are in the final act of the movie. The chase through the jungle is a good action sequence despite some dodgy effects and the ant scene is not nearly as bad as I remembered it, but I can see why some people dislike it. However, the way they survive a drop down three big waterfalls is completely ridiculous and of course there is Shia swinging on vines with a bunch of monkeys. I don't know how that shot made into the movie but it's really, really dumb. I think Crystal Skull would be dramatically less hated if they left out those ten seconds of footage. If I remember correctly, many people also dislike the alien angle. I'm completely ok with it and here's why: Indiana Jones is a universe where God is confirmed to exist and where ancient sorcery is still practiced. So why not aliens, too? I might not necessarily believe that aliens helped ancient South American civilizations, but it is an intriguing subject for fictionalized archaeology of the Indy variety and the finale in the temple is a good one.

So what is the verdict? I no longer have to pretend there are only three Indiana Jones movies. The fourth one is flawed but it's still very much possible to enjoy it. I think if they cut two or three minutes of stuff from the movie, it would turn out great. Which is something you can't say about Temple of Doom, my new least favorite Indy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I watched Aliens last night and I noticed something that never bothered me before. Newt's hiding place, where they first find her and Ripley crawls in to get here, is in a huge vent with constant airflow. So her scent must be all over the place and the Xenos could find her very easily. They might not be able to fit inside to get her, but they could circle the place so she would be trapped in the vent. I reckon either this is a mistake and should be taken with a grain of salt, or the Xenos have no sense of smell. Can you think of any scenes where they use smell or, on the other hand, where it is obvious that they have none? And do they even breathe (seeing as they can survive vacuum)? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm interested in how sex was perceived in various cultures and in different eras, how people understood orgasms, what were some customs, positions or rituals associated with sex, etc. Basically I'm looking for a cultural anthropological history of sex. I'm also interested in neuroscience, so books about sex from this point of view are welcome as well. Any suggestions for books or even articles would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember reading somewhere that James Cameron showed the movie to Kubrick and he was blown away by the effects. The movie really holds up in the technical department but the story itself is still pretty cool as well. It's a great action comedy that partially makes fun of its own ridiculousness and it's highly entertaining from start to finish. I'm not sure how popular this movie actually is, but I feel like it should be way more popular. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My top 15 sci-fi movies of the last ten years (2004-2014) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-20 12:32:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is my list of the 15 best sci-fi movies of the last ten years. It was going to be just a top 10, but there were so many good movies to choose from. I left out all comic book movies because I see them as a genre of their own. Each movie on the list is accompanied by a short explanation of why I chose it.

* **15. Another Earth (2011)** - I admire low budget sci-fi that adds more plot and real emotion instead of big effects and pomp. This movie has an interesting (albeit not wholly original) sci-fi concept and it explores its effect on two people.

* **14. Cloverfield (2008)** - As a thrilling ride evoking 9/11 horrors in combination with a classic monster attack on a big city, this movie makes great use of the found footage first person format. 

* **13. Mr. Nobody (2009)** - Jared Leto is great in this complicated and emotional sci-fi drama that tackles the classic "what if" concept in an interesting way.

* **12. Serenity (2005)** - Not only a gratification for fans of the TV show Firefly, but also a very well written space opera adventure that services all of its characters and brings some good action and twists.

* **11. TRON: Legacy (2010)** - This movie's script and acting are far from ideal, but it does a perfect job of taking the viewer to a whole new and wonderfully designed world, which coupled with a great soundtrack creates an audio-visual experience to be remembered. It was also influential with its costume design and overall look.

* **10. Star Trek (2009)** - Think what you will of the altered timeline, lens flares, or its awful sequel, but Star Trek is a fun time at the movies with great special effects and a perfect cast that breathes new life into a classic ensemble. 

* **9. Primer (2004)** - This low-budget creative *tour de force* from Shane Carruth, who stars, writes, produces, directs, edits, and composes the music, is a complicated time travel tale that is still discussed after ten years and baffles and intrigues its viewers.

* **8. District 9 (2009)** - Jump-starting the careers of its director and star, this movie provides an interesting take on the alien invasion story by making it a failure where the aliens are stranded and persecuted on Earth. Great action, effects and designs galore. 

* **7. Edge of Tomorrow (2014)** - A straight up sci-fi action movie acts as a combination of D Day with Starship Troopers and gives us a fresh take on the Groundhog Day concept of repeating the same day over and over. Also interesting for Tom Cruise playing a coward (initially) and Emily Blunt as a supreme badass female heroine. 

* **6. The Man from Earth (2007)** - Another low key, low-budget story that resembles a theater play and is without any visual effects or action, yet gives us a fascinating story of a man who doesn't age and who has been alive for 12 thousand years. 

* **5. Moon (2009)** - Combining ideas and visuals from Solaris, Blade Runner, 2001 and Alien, this movie still manages to be wholly original and unlike any movie that came out in 2009 or even in all of 21st century so far. A great one man show from Sam Rockwell and the story has mystery and a twist.

* **4. Inception (2010)** - Nolan brings a fascinating and literally mind-blowing sci-fi twist to the heist genre with his original movie. Filled with stellar actors, it is both a fan favorite and admired by critics. Its great visuals were awarded with Oscars for effects and cinematography.

* **3. Snowpiercer (2013)** - Joon-ho Bong's English-language debut is a traditional sci-fi story in that it uses its futuristic story and setting to comment on current society and its problems. Wonderfully stylized action and a great turn from Chris Evans make it a thrilling experience.

* **2. War of the Worlds (2005)** - Despite criticism for its abrupt and anti-climactic ending, as well as a sudden change of pace halfway through the story, this movie is a showcase of Spielberg's great sci-fi action sensibilities. Once again evoking 9/11 (and its resulting paranoia) it remains one of the most thrilling movies in this director's rich career and good modern adaptation of the most classic of sci-fi tales.

* **1. Looper (2012)** - Beautifully shot, perfectly acted and completely original, this sci-fi thriller shows Rian Johnson's immense talent and seals him as one of the best young filmmakers and a real hope for the future of genre movies. A misleading marketing campaign mostly sold the movie as a time-travel showdown between Bruce Willis and his younger self, but in reality it has a deeper story with some Terminator-esque vibes and also provides an interesting take on the super hero mythos through the character Sara and her powerful telekinetic son, who she hopes will become good with proper upbringing and not an evil overlord. Makes you think what would've happened if Superman wasn't brought up by the Kents.

<TITLE> People keep criticizing J.J. Abrams for his use of lens flares but I watched LOOPER again and noticed Rian Johnson uses a lot of lens flares as well. Both are doing STAR WARS now. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First of all, Looper - what a great movie. Simply unbelievable. But I was really surprised how many lens flares there are. Sometimes they are small but some times they get ridiculous. Why is Abrams the only one who is getting crap for their use? Is is it just because more people saw his movies than Looper?

I also find it interesting that both Abrams and Johnson are doing Star Wars now. I remember when Abrams was announced for Episode VII that people we worried he'll use those lens flares from Star Trek again. There were fan trailers and parodies for this all over the internet and people pre-judged his movie's aesthetic because flares were never a part of the previous Episodes. But not a single word about Johnson's use of lens flares at all.

<TEXT> Blackhat is not getting the best reviews and it's probably going to flop, but I just saw it and I believe it's not nearly that bad. I went in knowing it had bad reviews and during the start of the film I could see why. The beginning is not very good but once it gets going it only gets better, I think. There are some surprises and by the end I found myself liking the movie and genuinely rooting for the main character. Speaking of whom, people say Hemsworth is too much of a hunk to realistically play a hacker, and while that might be true, at least his character is not the stereotypical action hero. He's much closer to a normal guy. He actually doesn't do that much during action scenes and even prepares a big first aid kit before he confronts some bad guys, knowing he'll probably get hurt. That's the sort of thing you never see in a movie. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I tried to watch THE RAID but had to turn it off after 20 minutes. I'm sorry, but why all the hype for this movie? Will it get better later on? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-13 16:02:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know people on reddit love The Raid, but before you drop the hate on me, please note that I'm sincerely trying to figure out what went wrong - I had hopes that I would love this movie too, but I just don't see it.

First of all, it looks cheap. Like crowd-funded-B-movie level of cheap. It had zero cinematic feeling to it, instead I got a home-made vibe from it, as if a group of friends put on some black sporting equipment and filmed themselves running around like SWAT. The completely obvious CG blood also took me out of the movie every single time. I'm not saying it's a bad thing to make a cheap movie and not everyone has massive budgets and Hollywood effects at their disposal. But I just couldn't take The Raid seriously.

The acting is as corny as it gets, though I'm perfectly willing to attribute this opinion to my own ignorance of Asian cinema in general and their acting sensibilities in particular. What did you guys think of the acting? Again, I only got that amateurish home-made vibe from it.

The script is, well... was there even a script? The opening is laughably expository to the point where a simple title card telling me the basic facts would probably be better than the scene in the van as they are riding to the building. And I found the rest largely unbelievable. Like when they are about to enter the gate but there's a guy who wants to deliver medicine to his wife and the whole team of armed men on an important and dangerous mission just stands around exposed while they argue with some civilian. Really? 

The action was ok, but I think I liked John Wick's action much more. As I said, I haven't even seen most of the movie because I was so disappointed that I turned it off. Will it get better? Is there going to be any actual story beyond the video-game scenario? Are there going to be any actual characters beyond the cliche evil cop boss and the cliche evil mafia boss?

Thank you for your helpful responses. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I watched a couple of episodes during the first season but then I stopped for some reason and I forgot all about the show. Later I heard that it got really bad and so I was happy that I didn't waste my time with it. Then I watched a few episodes on a very long and boring flight and they were from the third season and seemed ok. After that I read somewhere that the show changed and became great after going very much downhill. So could you please elaborate on what the show's problems were, how it changed, and whether I should pick it up again? Thanks!

EDIT: Just thought I'd let you know that thanks to your responses I picked up the show again and I'm enjoying it a lot. I sort of got into a binge-watching spiral yesterday, finished season 1 and got halfway through season 2. I'm really enjoying and but I noticed the sexual/emotional tension between Nick and Jess is ENORMOUS. I'm surprised it took the writers three seasons to put those characters together. Shame they didn't handle it well. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Surprisngly negative thoughts on Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) after watching it again this weekend </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-18 20:02:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I really enjoyed GotG in the cinema this summer and I was really looking forward to seeing it again. So I was very surprised when I watched it this weekend and noticed that it's not really that good. At all. 

I think a lot of this has to do with being blow away by the new world and characters initially when I first saw it. I have never read a comic book in my life and although I've been catching up on some Marvel stuff at least on wikipedia whenever a new movie comes out, I knew next to nothing about the Guardians. So seeing it for the first time at the cinema, suddenly I was in this awesome, colorful, fun world with weird and amusing characters and a pumping soundtrack and lots of jokes. But this novelty has since worn off and I started seeing the movie's major faults.

Villains are not the MCU's strongest suit and in this movie in particular the bad guy is there simply to be bad. Ronan was visually great but his motivations were underdeveloped. He wanted vengeance for something that happened god knows when off screen and he despised some sort of peace treaty that we only ever learned about from a character watching TV. In fact, practically every character's motivations for their actions were based on something that happened in the past and off screen. People hate Gamora because she's done bad things, but we never saw that. She betrays Ronan because she hates him for doing other bad things we didn't see. Drax wants to avenge a family we never met who died who knows when. Rocket apparently has some sort of painful Wolverine-being-experimented-on-esque past that is barely mentioned. And the movie goes out if its way to awkwardly set up Peter's alien father but it leads absolutely nowhere and I guess we'll have to wait for the sequel to find out anything relevant about it. 

The plot of the movie is also pretty thin. It's a very straightforward story about chasing the MacGuffin and I guess everybody in the movie has to make at least three deals with other people and get betrayed at least twice for the story to move forward. And all that to save (or destory, if you're looking at it from Ronan's perspective destroy) a city that's very pretty to look at but as an audience member I have absolutely no reason to care about Xandar at all. It's not even any of these characters' home (or is it? because the movie is vague on that part as well). I feel like GotG was a great way to launch a new franchise, because it's a simple and fun movie, but for the sequel they are going to have to come up with a much better story and give these characters more depth, otherwise it will just be a dumb movie with a talking racoon.

<TEXT> First of all, I wonder if something like this happened, whether people would say they were brave for trying an album like that, or only that it was a stunt, an attempt to call attention to both themselves and Pink Floyd, who asked them to do it in the first place.

Second, I wonder if Daft Punk could pull off something like this and perhaps revolutionize how rock fans view electronic music.
