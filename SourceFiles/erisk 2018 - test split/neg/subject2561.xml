<TEXT> If you have a Delta Amex, then there are two ways you can use Skymiles. 

1. As miles. You can find award travel on Delta's site and pay based on the tier of travel. This can be very valuable for Delta One flights. 

2. As a 1cpp "cash" redemption. With the Amex, you are allowed to exchange Skymiles in blocks of 5,000 for $50 off the cash price of a ticket. This is only useful when there is a low cash fare (often domestic economy). </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. There are no cards you can change to without an annual fee. The cheapest is $95 for the Green card.
2. You need to have one MR earning card open at all times to store your points. If you don't have one, I'd recommend looking into the Amex Everyday card. It is a credit card (not a charge card) but also earns MR points without an annual fee. If you open it first, then your points from your Platinum will be preserved. If you go to Rank.com, there is an offer for 15K points after $1k spend for the Everyday. 
3. There are some data point son Flyer Talk of being able to purchase small airline gift cards with the travel credit. I would recommend looking there.  </TEXT>

The best you can get via incognito is an additional $250 back after $1k spend. Via referrals it is $100 for the BCE and $150 for the BCP. Again this is on top of the restaurant bonus.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You could apply for the Delta Platinum amex. There's currently a 50K offer after $1k spend via [referral from Rankt.com](https://rankt.com/r/churning/referrals/amex_delta_platinum/). 

It does have a $195 annual fee, but the signup bonus comes with a $100 statement credit if you make any Delta purchase (including paying the taxes on an award flight)

edit: Make sure you use the 50K links (the 60K links are for a different card and should not be there). While it's not the historical high of 70K, it's good if you need the points soon.

Also, the bonus posts quickly on amex, usually within 1-2 days of meeting the minimum spend, so you don't have to wait until your statement closes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> * Unfortunately, there is no longer a free Delta card. There is a lower tier card (I believe just called "Delta Skymiles card") which has a $55 AF but offers no benefits. Not worth it, in my opinion.
* It is possible to upgrade to the Delta Plat without a hard pull. I did this several years ago. However, you will not get the sign-up bonus and will be excluded from receiving a sign-up bonus for this card in the future. When you call, ask them if you have an offer for upgrading (I forget what I was offered, but it was enough to make it worth it for me).
* The companion certificate is awarded every year upon renewal, so you would get it next April. However, I believe it is possible to cancel your card after the AF posts. Since the certificate is already in your Delta account, they won't take it back.

Hope this helps! </TEXT>

You could lower your cash advance limit to $20 (or whatever the lowest is). Plastiq will give you a warning if it will trigger a cash advance, so you can just try it out and see if it goes through. 

Alternatively, you can contact Plastiq and let them know. They can try to set up the relationship before you send your first payment.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> A Guide to Plastiq </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-21 17:26:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **What is Plastiq?**

Plastiq is a service which lets you pay "any bill" with your credit card for a fee. Essentially, you pay Plastiq with your card and they will cut a check to your recipient. This allows you to pay for things such as your rent or mortgage with a card even if your landlord / provider does not offer a pay with credit card option. The standard fee is 2.5%, though occasionally there are promotions (i.e. there was a 2% promo for Amex cards earlier this year).

**What does a Plastiq check look like?**

Kind of like a paper check!
In all seriousness, u/Lazy_Gremlin graciously uploaded a [photo of what the check looks like](http://m.imgur.com/GAZ66vx?r). It mentions you (the customer) and is addressed to your recipient. 


**How long does Plastiq take to send a payment?**

Generally, it takes 5-10 business days from the date you schedule the payment for your recipient to receive the check. However, whenever you schedule a payment, Plastiq gives you a date by which the recipient will get the check. It's always good to double check this and make sure you pay early enough so that you don't end up with any late payment fees from your landlord, etc. This is especially important if this is your first time paying a recipient.


**When does Plastiq charge your card?**

They charge it when they process your payment, which is when they'll send the check out. Your recipient won't get until a few days later. 


**Does paying through Plastiq count as a purchase or a cash advance?**

Based on our current knowledge, if you pay with an Amex, Mastercard, or Discover, your payment will process as a purchase. However, things get a little trickier with a Visa card. If Plastiq has a "prior relationship" with your payee, then your payment should go through as a purchase. A "prior relationship" means that you or someone else has sent a payment to that payee before. Thus, most of the big mortgage and rent companies are on there, but yours may not be.


But don't worry, if there's a risk of your payment being processed as a cash advance, Plastiq will let you know when you go to schedule your payment. If you get a warning, then DO NOT send the payment.


What should you do if you get the warning? The recommendation is to pay the recipient with another card (i.e. an Amex) first so as to establish a relationship with them. Then, for your second payment onwards, you can pay with your Visa. Just to be safe, you can ask your credit card bank to reduce your cash advance limit so that if Plastiq tries to process your payment as a cash advance, it will get rejected.

**Can I use Plastiq to meet minimum spend requirements?**

Yes you can, and it is a great way if you do not wish to do manufactured spending. While there have been discussions about Plastiq being considered a "cash equivalent", it has thus far been safe to use (no clawback of points) and in fact was promoted as part of Amex's Shop Small last December.

**Can I pay myself or a family member / friend?**

Perhaps you have a roommate who pays the rent and you usually just send them a check. Or you are paying back a friend for a trip you took with them. Though there is nothing stopping you from doing this, be warned that Plastiq may ask you to submit an invoice / contract / lease as proof. You should be fine as long as you can justify it to them.


**Can I pay my credit card statement with Plastiq?**

No you cannot.


**What are these fee-free dollars (FFDs)?**

Fee-free dollars are Plastiq's form of bonuses. While you are normally charged a 2.5% fee on any transaction, you can redeem FFDs to negate this fee. So, for example, on a $500 payment you would normally be charged a $12.50 fee. However, if you had 500 FFDs, you could use those to negate that fee. 

UPDATED: Currently, you can earn **500 FFDs** by [using someone's referral link](https://rankt.com/r/churning/referrals/plastiq/) to sign up for Plastiq AND making a payment of **$500** or more (so you can use the FFDs starting on your second payment).

If you refer someone to Plastiq, you will earn 1,000 FFDs (as of 4/24/17). Thanks to u/zackiv31 and u/ruxpin810 for this update.


**What is the deal with earning 3x on Plastiq payments?**

As of mid-April 2017, it appears that if you are paying rent or mortgage via Plastiq, it is coding on Visa cards as "travel", earning higher rewards points on cards such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve (3x) and the Chase Ink Preferred (3x). Since you earn 3x UR points per dollar and are paying a 2.5% fee, you can earn a net positive of 0.5% if you redeem UR points for statement credit or even higher if you redeem for travel. It is unknown how long this will last. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes that should work. While you have a Delta Amex open, you can redeem blocks of 5000 points for $50 off the ticket price, and pay the rest in cash. Skymiles will usually post to your Delta account within a couple business days of meeting the minimum spend. 

You can also get the $50 statement credit for buying a gift card on Delta.com and then using that for part of the payment as well. 

Also, if you go via a referral on Rankt.com, the bonus is 40K after $1k spend.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Regarding the Everday card, I think in your case it would be worth it to get that and cancel the PRG. The current offer via referral for the ED is 15K MR / $1k spend, while the historic high (via incognito) is 25K MR / $2k spend. I think taking the 10K less now is better than paying the $195 AF (minus the airline credit if you can use those). It's also a good card to keep open long term so that you can always cancel other charge cards and keep your MRs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on your goals. If you want to earn status, then PQD waiver is worth it (I am doing something similar with Delta). UR points will definitely get you more "bang for your buck", especially given the recent DPs that you may be able to get 3x UR points / $1 for rent on Plastiq. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You will probably get more advice in the what card thread.

In general though, the way to maximize this would be to spread that amount over several new credit cards to obtain the sign up bonuses. However, if you feel uncomfortable opening several cards each quarter (which is completely understandable), then you could try to find one good card and maximize that. At that level of spend, something like the Chase Sapphire Reserve or Amex Platinum would each net you a large amount of flexible points. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tomahawks have been the bread and butter the Navy's missile system and are installed in many of the warships that are stationed in the middle east. Here's a paragraph from a WaPo article about them:

 One of the largest advantages to using the Tomahawk is that it does not require a pilot to be anywhere near a potential target. They can be launched from Navy destroyers up to 1,000 miles away, a tactical consideration when facing enemy air defenses.

<TEXT>  The U.S. military gave Russian forces advanced notice of its strikes on a Syrian airbase and did not hit sections of the base where the Russians were believed to be present, Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said on Thursday.

 Davis, briefing reporters on the operation, said the U.S. military had "multiple" conversations with Russian forces on Thursday before the strike, using a line of communication that had previously been established to prevent an accidental clash in Syria during the fight against Islamic State.

<TITLE> [Analysis] If all three base stats are tied, Tyrogue has a 50% chance of evolving into Hitmontop and 25% each for the other two </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-06 18:05:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yesterday, I had posted a [survey](http://www.strawpoll.me/12684380/r) requesting inputs from people who had a Tyrogue with two or more stats tied. Thank you all for your response, we collected 375 data points.

For the cases where two stats are tied, it appears that there is a 50/50 chance as to which evolution will occur, as expected.

However, the data suggest a non-random pattern when all three stats are tied. Here's the analysis.

We collected 93 data points for when all three stats are tied, with the following results: 45 Top, 23 Chan, 25 Lee. I conducted a Pearson's Chi-squared test with 2 degrees of freedom to see if these results are statistically significant from the null hypothesis that the data come from a random distribution. I obtained a one-tailed critical value of 9.54, which  yields a p value  0.01. Thus, I will conclude that when all three stats are tied, we can reject the null hypothesis that it is random which evolution occurs.

Based on the distribution, we have approximately a 2:1:1 ratio of Top:Chan:Lee, indicating that **if all three stats are tied, there is a 50% chance of evolving into a Hitmontop**. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To collect data on what happens to Tyrogue if it has tied best stats (a tie-rogue, if you will) and you evolve it. Is it truly random or does one or other evolution win out? Lets find out. 

**Edit**: Thank you all for contributing! Based on the 350 data points we have as of 9:50am EDT on 4/6/17, we can start to see an interesting trend.

For the cases where two stats are tied, it appears as expected that there is a 50/50 split between the evolution.

However, in the case where all three stats are tied, it appears that we have a 2:1:1 ratio, favoring Hitmontop. Of the 86 data points of all tied, 42 of them turned into Top, with 20 and 24 for Chan and Lee. I will wait to see more data points reported before making any statistical conclusions, but this is quite interesting!

**TL;DR: It appears that if all three stats are equal, there is a 50% chance of evolving into Himontop, and 25% each for Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee** </TEXT>

<TEXT> A key counterargument to Pai's logic is made by Ars, comparing the wireless market to home ISPs:

 Total market share is a relevant statistic in mobile because customers really do have a choice, from four major nationwide carriers and various resellers and regional carriers. In home Internet service, a similar nationwide market share stat would on the surface show even more diversity of broadband companies, as even the nation's largest home ISP (Comcast) doesn't reach 35 percent.

 But for home Internet customers, the relevant point is whether they can choose from multiple providers at their home or apartment. And they frequently can't, since ISPs often avoid each other's territory. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It completely depends on the redemption. If you use points for an international DeltaOne flight, you may get several cents per skymile in value, but that assumes you would consider paying the cash price for it. Domestic in economy will usually run you between 1-2 cpp, maybe more if you're lucky.

If you have a Delta Amex card, they have an option where you can "Pay with Miles", wherein you pay the cash price for a ticket and can discount it by $50 for every 5k miles you redeem. This guarantees you a 1cpp value, so you would never go below that.

Also - you can only open 2 credit cards within 90 days, so with your SPG you could only get one other Delta card. As far as I know, the Delta Platinum offer is currently 35K skymiles + 5K MQM, so not a great offer (unless someone has a better referral offer, I have not been able to get anything higher). </TEXT>

<TEXT> The media attention around yesterday's bill suggested that it would fund Mars exploration. If you look at yesterday's top post on this subreddit, it suggested the same. This is trying to correct that record, not to suggest that NASA had already planned a mission that is getting tabled.

edit: here's the relevant quote from this article:
 Much of the general news coverage after President Trump signed the NASA authorization bill on Tuesday focused on the legislation's call for sending humans to Mars. (For example, the AP headlined its story "Trump signs bill authorizing NASA funding, Mars exploration"). </TEXT>

 Much of the general news coverage after President Trump signed the NASA authorization bill on Tuesday focused on the legislation's call for sending humans to Mars.[...] However, this perception is probably wrong, as Musk points out. There is lukewarm interest in Congress about aggressively funding humans to Marswhich would cost hundreds of billions of dollars to do using traditional aerospace firmsand according to sources Ars has spoken to, holds almost no interest within the Trump administration itself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty excited about a couple of the new features, especially the Autofill API:

Autofill APIs: Android users already depend on a range of password managers to autofill login details and repetitive information, which makes setting up new apps or placing transactions easier. Now we are making this work more easily across the ecosystem by adding platform support for autofill. Users can select an autofill app, similar to the way they select a keyboard app. The autofill app stores and secures user data, such as addresses, user names, and even passwords. For apps that want to handle autofill, we're adding new APIs to implement an Autofill service. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep, should go through with no problems in most circumstances, except as described below.

The one caveat: if you're paying with a Visa card, there is a chance Plastiq will attempt to use it as a cash advance instead of a credit charge. This happens in some cases, and only if Plastiq has no prior relationship with your apartment company. They will warn you if this will happen, and you can cancel the payment. My recommendation is to call up your credit card provider and lower your cash advance limit to the minimum allowed, just in case. If you're not using a Visa, then no worries!

Also, if this is your first time using Plastiq, please [use a referral](https://rankt.com/r/churning/referrals/plastiq/) to get 400 fee-free dollars (and support a lucky user in this community!) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure about hotels, but The Points Guy has done some guides comparing the different major airline status programs. While I disagree with his actual valuations, I do find it's a useful summary of the benefits you get at different tiers, and he does mention some ways to achieve them. Essentially, it's going to be either through flying or spending on airline-branded credit cards.

More details are here: https://thepointsguy.com/guides/

Once you find an airline you think is best for you, then look into their co-branded cards and see what sort of elite-qualifying bonuses the cards offer. Delta, for example, offers up to 20-30K medallion qualifying miles on their Platinum and Reserve cards if you spend enough on them. </TEXT>

While I am personally against many of the stipulations in the bill, I would also stand to gain from it based on being young and healthy. So the question becomes, if this bill were to hypothetically pass, what would you do with regard to any benefits you receive? Should one not take advantage of tax credits, or should one do that and then donate the money to those in need of health care, or should one take advantage of it while keeping on petitioning Congress to change it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can only product change within charge cards, and the cheapest would be the Green card for $95. If you want to keep the PRG, you can ask for a retention offer which may offset some of the AF.

Otherwise, to prevent losing any MR points you have, I would recommend opening up an Amex Everyday credit card. It is a no-AF card which lets you keep your MR points. Current offers for that are either 25K MR after $2k spend (if you can get it via incognito mode), or 15K MR after $1k spend (via referral). </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you do have a qualifying federal loan, you can look into the Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Essentially, you would spend the first part of your post-residency career working in an area with physician need (often rural primary practices or urban care centers), and over a period of time the remainder of your loan would be forgiven. I would highly recommend speaking to your med school's advisers about this and other options. Best of luck to you!

<TEXT> Paragraph A: The original purpose of daylight savings time was to shift the working day during spring/summer so as to maximize house of sunlight. This way, farmers (which was the dominant career for most Americans back then) could spend most of their labor hours with sunlight. Similarly, when the winter months arrive, the time is shifted back so as to again maximize sunlight. While there are fewer Americans in agriculture these days, daylight savings time still enables better synchronicity of the working day with the sun.

Paragraph B: While daylight savings time may have been useful in the former agrarian society of the US, it is no longer necessary since the majority of Americans work indoors. Even for agriculture, much of the work is now automated and the extra hour of daylight does not make much of a difference. Instead, like OP pointed out, the time shifts cause distractions and disorientations in the days immediately following. </TEXT>

That being said, there are some fantastic cash deals to Europe right now, and you might be better off with one of those. If you do have (or later get) a Delta Amex card, you can even pay the cash price in miles using a 5k=$50 conversion. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Flying an American flag upside down is not necessarily meant as political protest. The practice has its origin in a distress signal; displaying a flag in this manner is "a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property"; It can also be viewed as an act of desecration. It has been used by extension to make a statement about distress in civic, political, or other areas.

<TEXT> Paragraph A:
Attending a university will provide you with the skills and social credentials you need in order to get a better job down the road. Adults with a bachelor's or advanced degree tend to get higher starting salaries at jobs. Furthermore, for some careers, it is necessary to develop skills at university beyond what you would get in high school / vocational school. Invest in yourself now, and it will pay off down the road.

Paragraph B:
Society has progressed for hundreds of years without needing everyone to go to college. While there are some professions which require degrees in order to practice, most of the skills you will need for a successful career are things you will learn outside of the classroom. Why spend an extra 4 (or more) years studying theory when you can start working now, start earning money, and eventually build your way up. Many of the most successful people in business, marketing, the arts, politics, etc., did not need to have formal university training. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Clinton [...] warned repeatedly against us versus them thinking that he said has become such an active part of politics in America, in the Brexit vote, in the Philippines and throughout Europe.

It's not just blaming the GOP or the Brexiters. We all could do a better job to try and be civil, engage with those we disagree with, and point out the facts without making ad hominem attacks. Even if some of them won't listen, I have to believe that the majority of people are still reasonable and coming from different perspectives. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A: The US did not actually land astronauts on the moon in 1969. Rather, it was all a plot to one-up the Soviets in the space race. President Kennedy had promised in 1962 that we would reach the moon by the end of that decade, ahead of the others. With Cold War tensions reaching a zenith during this decade (Bay of Pigs, Vietnam), the US had to find a way to show that it had the scientific and technological advantage over the USSR. However, with the current level of technology, it was impossible to successfully bring humans to the moon and back, as suggested by former Rocketdyne engineer Bill Kaysing and others. Thus, the government and NASA staged a fake launch and moon landing, just in the nick of time before the decade ran out.

B: The Apollo program was designed and carried out throughout the 1960s with the precise goal of landing Americans on the moon's surface. With the Space Race ongoing during the Cold War, the government pumped money into NASA's R D to make this happen. American ingenuity and engineering has never been wanting, we're only constrained my money, and by God we were able to do it. The Apollo ship and capsule design was rapidly iterated over the various Apollo missions. 11 missions were made in 3 years, each fixing the problems faced by the last one and slowly getting closer to reaching the moon. Apollo 8 reached the moon and made several orbits of it. Apollo 10 made it to just 50km above the lunar surface. And finally, in July 1969, Apollo 11 and its astronauts made the landing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Intro: Here's looking specifically at one of the differences between it and the Affordable Care Act (ACA), regarding the individual mandate. The ACA required that all Americans purchase health insurance, either through employer, through the individual marketplace, or access it through Medicare/Medicaid. If the individual lived in a state that did not expand Medicaid access (19 states), they were exempt from the mandate. The new bill removes this mandate, allowing people to go without insurance. However, if someone has no insurance and then decides to get insurance, they can be charged up to a 30% premium.

Paragraph A: The new bill provides more financial freedom to people who do not wish to purchase health insurance. For example, young and healthy people will likely not need to get much health work done, and so can save money by not getting insurance. If someone does have a chronic illness, or acutely becomes sick, they can always sign up for insurance with no more than a 30% surcharge.

Paragraph B: Requiring everyone to have insurance is a way to ensure the sustainability of insurance programs. Even though young, healthy people will likely not need to undergo much care, their payments would support those who do need it. Removing the mandate will cause insurance premiums to increase, since those needing healthcare will be more likely to actually purchase insurance, and not people who are healthy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the main tenets of the ACA is to improve preventive care, which will lower the cost of healthcare over the course of decades. It is not really designed to ameliorate catastrophic care.

An article in the New England Journal looked at ER visits in Massachusetts after the state passed insurance reform (which is what the ACA is modeled after). The authors found there was no real significant change in ER utilization when compared to two other states which did not have similar reform.

<TEXT>  Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Shelley Moore Capito (R. W.Va.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said they would vote against any reform bill that fails to protect Americans who became eligible for coverage under the ACAs expansion of Medicaid. 

 With 52 Republicans, McConnell would not have enough votes to pass repeal without the support of at least two of those senators.

If you live in any of those 4 states, it is especially important to call and speak to these Senators' offices. They could be a make it or break it for this bill (whatever variation ultimately comes to a Senate vote) </TEXT>
