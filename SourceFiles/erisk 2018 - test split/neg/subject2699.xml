As is often the case with conservative bills, the bill is actually model legislation that didnt originate here in South Carolina. Its being introduced in about 25 states this coming year, according to Chris Sevier, a former attorney from Tennessee whos behind the model law. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think plenty of people (especially groups like Everytown) take a more holistic view of gun violence, in which it's not just about the damage that is inflicted when Person A intentionally shoots Person B -- or in this case, Person A. Imagine going to a school where someone has committed suicide on campus, or where a gun battle happened in the parking lot the night before, even if it didn't involve students. Or where a kid brought in a gun and accidentally shot into the ceiling and didn't hit anyone. All of this has an effect on students, not just when it's a deliberate act of targeted violence. </TEXT>

11/3/2016 Berthoud, CO Berthoud High School

Another student suicide. Everytown didnt pretend to care about the other one, because it happened at a home. Not a threat to other students. Not a school shooting.

Yet the [link](http://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/2016/11/04/berthoud-high-school-teen-found-dead-identified/93289106/) he provides clearly states that the kid shot himself at school.

<TEXT> This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MappUyWPY5M) from Charlie LeDuff in Detroit is one of my favorites on this topic. At the 3:30ish mark, he's talking to beat cops about the dangers of the job. He asks one of them what he'd do if someone came rushing at him without a gun.

"That's just a fight," responds the officer.

Fighting an angry suspect has to be scary as shit, and it's certainly not a job I'd want to do, but is this not a risk that comes with the territory and that police are equipped and trained to handle? When did it become standard operating procedure for law enforcement and apologists/supporters to consider any physical altercation to be grounds for cops to use deadly force? Couldn't they bust out the nightstick and beat the suspect down? Didn't cops used to enjoy having an excuse to do that kinda stuff? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never suggested he wasn't dangerous. He stabbed people, cops knew that, I understand it was a tense situation. I don't know what you're envisioning, but this was not a case where the kid had a knife to a hostage's neck or something. The only people left to hurt were police -- humans and a dog. Considering they outnumbered a 15-year-old suspect clearly out of his mind and armed only with a knife, it seems like they could balance the need to "stop other people from getting stabbed" with the basic human desire, one presumes, not to kill a kid who has done terrible things during a mental break.

Instead of reflexively defending the officer's action, which again I agree was lawful, why don't we consider how a tragedy like this can be used as a teachable moment to avoid unnecessary loss of life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They had time to use non-lethal force six times. And they are educated/licensed to kill people with ease. Why can't we all agree that we should shift some priorities away from killing and toward de-escalation, proper tactical confrontation, dealing with people in crisis, etc. to minimize the need to kill. Not saying they shouldn't be able to kill -- I agree that this case will be closed relatively quickly -- but we should all want to avoid seeing sad shit like this happen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Officer can't be blamed for operating according to rules. Real question is whether cops should have more options for dealing with someone in a mental crisis. Not just a matter of non-lethal weapons, though it seems like there are probably more devices out there that could shut down a situation like this, beyond what they had. But maybe serious psych help from a professional would actually work better than deciding that the proper way to respond to a violent incident is with further violence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't underestimate the power of a good moral compass. Also consider how factors that are outside of our control (family situation, wealth, mental health, etc.) make it easier or harder for us to keep these compasses well-aligned.

Anyway, jailing people for poverty doesn't make sense. I'm sure a lot of these fines could simply be forgiven without massive damage to the systems that have come to accept massive arbitrary fines as the cost of business. Or these places could work to create a more proactive method of getting people on a schedule that will allow them to pay when they can pay, or work off fines by other means.

Either way, the argument that laws must be enforced to bring people into compliance to avoid anarchy starts making less sense when the laws themselves are so often enforced in unjust ways and then amplified by further unjust means of getting people to comply. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But what does incarceration actually accomplish? Does it keep people from breaking the law? On the contrary, evidence shows punishing someone with jail only increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior. Does not rehabilitate and does not succeed in actually extracting concessions -- in this case financial -- from the person. In fact, only costs taxpayers more to house inmates and pay for future social costs they're likely to incur. We need to completely rethink the way we use incarceration as a punitive measure. We cage humans out of some sort of cruel sense of retribution, which makes us treat inmates as subhuman both while behind bars and after they get out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone seems to be skipping over the bigger picture here, which was that she had the choice to shoot the guy BEFORE he began smashing her face and is regretting her decision not to in hindsight. Nobody's saying she wouldn't have been in the right to shoot him in the midst of the attack. But instead we're getting a dangerous defense of a shoot-first mentality, which can obviously be problematic, even if it might prevent some terrible incidents like this. Seems like there's a different tactical approach that could have led to a less rapid escalation of the situation and made it harder for the guy to so quickly isolate a single officer. Again, there were 4 cops.

Also, how about the other cops? Why didn't they shoot this guy? </TEXT>

<TEXT> A little bit on Australia and what the nation actually did after Port Arthur. They held a mandatory buyback of banned weapons types and destroyed automatic and semi-automatic rifles and shotguns. This was not the kind of "confiscation" many people try to scare us with today. Brown-shirts did not go door to door grabbing guns. And while they did raise the bar for gun ownership and create a registry, there are still plenty of guns in Australia today.

<TEXT> Depends on your definition of "better." They could make an intruder more dead than a pistol could. They could also fill your house and your neighbor's house full of stray bullets. I don't think anyone *needs* an AR-15 for home defense. A shotgun has always seemed like a more sensible choice. But I can see why gun-lovers want them. I can also see why making them available to civilians poses and inherent, though infrequent, risk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No person who has a remote grasp of this issue, politician or otherwise, thinks we're ever going to get rid of civilian gun ownership. Even those who wish we lived in a utopia where people didn't ever need firearms understand that it would be impossible, both politically and logistically, to get rid of 400 million civilian-owned firearms. Once we get this conspiratorial distraction out of the way, we can have an open discussion about whether the proposals we're seeing now are actually effective or worthwhile. If they're not, it's because the proposals are shitty, not because it's impossible to find an acceptable middle ground that will address gun violence and satisfy legal gun owners. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not true. Assault-style rifles are better tools, plain and simple. Easier to shoot, better accuracy, better range, are in most cases capable of carrying significantly more ammunition, have higher muzzle velocity, less recoil, highly moddable, the list goes on. How are those the exact same characteristics? Both guns shoot bullets? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Report is BS and sensationalist media reports have danced around the study's admission that presence of THC does not necessarily equal impairment or even signify that the driver was "stoned." This is like saying criminals must be stoned when they commit crimes (and must have been influenced by the weed), because they test positive for THC.

Driving impaired is stupid and less safe than driving sober, but this study doesn't necessarily show a correlation -- and certainly doesn't show causation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The biggest institutional push [came at the height of the Red Scare](https://www.treasury.gov/about/education/Pages/in-god-we-trust.aspx):

A law passed by the 84th Congress (P.L. 84-140) and approved by the President on July 30, 1956, the President approved a Joint Resolution of the 84th Congress, declaring IN GOD WE TRUST the national motto of the United States. IN GOD WE TRUST was first used on paper money in 1957, when it appeared on the one-dollar silver certificate. The first paper currency bearing the motto entered circulation on October 1, 1957. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) was converting to the dry intaglio printing process. During this conversion, it gradually included IN GOD WE TRUST in the back design of all classes and denominations of currency. </TEXT>

So instead of sending a strong, actionable message against that sort of behavior, police are getting a further signal that they should shoot first and ask questions later, if ever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm aware that the union is just doing its job. I'm suggesting that the job is the problem. It leads to many bad officers -- but perhaps not criminally bad ones, at least according to the laws that favor them -- keeping their jobs. He was "fired," though that firing is now being challenged, which is why many officers in these cases are instead forced to resign.

You're also right that unions are not literally magic -- they can't force departments to continue employing a cop who is in jail for murder, for example. But I still think they do far more harm by protecting bad officers than they do by defending good ones who have legitimate gripes. In an ideal world, they could to the latter without doing the former. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This story demonstrates that even in the rare case a police department wants to fire an officer for messing up badly, they can't because of police unions. That's an old story. But the news here is that it holds true even when it's a high-profile case in which an officer has seemingly killed someone unnecessarily -- though whether it was illegal or not is yet to be determined. In my opinion, if a department believes an officer is no longer fit for their department, they shouldn't be forced to continue employing them due to a fucked up bureaucratic system that shelters cops who aren't good at their jobs. </TEXT>

They don't see this ever happening to them and they're convinced it's a problem for other people, or not a problem at all. In many ways the former is true, which is why it's a BLACK Lives Matter movement, not an ALL lives matter movement. For white people this isn't a basic issue of self-preservation and injustice that affects you and all of your family members at some point or another -- though that doesn't mean those issues can't.

Seriously though, you're gonna point fingers at black people for not giving a shit when a white person is killed? Black people have enough activism to do for their own causes and you act like it's somehow on them to get white people's shit together? Fuck man, I dunno what to tell you. I think if white people showed black people unconditional support -- and came to terms with what BLM is actually about -- and then followed that up by showing that we even cared about white people killed by police, they would join in any protest that was mounted. Good luck getting white people to do anything on this issue though. And until we get our shit together, I blame nobody but ourselves. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The story has updated a few times, and I feel like the "in the back" line was more directly referenced in initial versions of the text, though my bad if it wasn't. I may have translated the passage about officers "trying to put his hands or arms behind his back" as meaning they were behind the individual when he was shot. Cops don't put people's hands behind their back while face-to-face with a suspect.

Lots of moving parts here, hed now read "Events leading up to LAPD shooting of man with skateboard remain unclear," which is not very helpful.

A reminder that a witness' recounting shouldn't be accepted as fact, no matter what he said. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Convenient and fucked-up paradox:

1.) Police refuse reforms for the sort of transparency that might be able prevent these so-called "bogus charges." (body cameras, etc.)

2.) Adjudicators opt for settlements to avoid jury trials. While perhaps more costly, trials would also allow the public to see any evidence that said charges were not, in fact, bogus.

3.) Taxpayers gets saddled with the financial burden of settlements, while cops walk away with administrative presumption of innocence (nothing was proven!).

4.) Cops are sent the message that they're free to continue acting in a way that repeats the cycle, knowing that nothing will change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Concerning, but if you actually read the complaint, I don't know where these stories are coming up with the suggestion that these people have actually cast ballots in any elections yet. Not saying they couldn't have, not saying they didn't, just saying the complaint is concerned about a possibility -- and seemingly a valid one -- not a reality.

What this shows -- beyond the usefulness of body cams -- is that the actions of bad cops affect (and even alter) everyone's perception of all cops, including the ones who have no intent of doing anything wrong. It's why bad policing is such a big issue and should be treated by law enforcement as such. </TEXT>

"Billionaire Koch Brother Must Face Suit Alleging That He Falsely Imprisoned Ex-Employee, Judge Rules" would have been more accurate. Apologies for the misnomer, but the point still stands, Koch's attempt to dismiss this case has been rejected by a federal judge. However the case (or merits of the allegations) end up getting decided is yet to be known, but they will at least be considered. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's sketchy, but technically they would be the ones deciding if it's voted out. The measure to repeal would be wrapped into a ballot amendment that would be couched on approving more taxes. The way I understand it is it would set up the following scenario: 

a.) Vote for higher taxes and in so doing, keep marijuana legal.

Or b.) Reject higher taxes (which voters generally like doing) and in so doing, support the repeal of legal marijuana. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Scary, but before we freak out too much, let's remember that whoever got picked had to be a Republican (so statistically likely to be a creationist no matter what), and that out of the potential choices, it seems like the scientific/health research community doesn't sound too down on Kingston.

<TEXT> I wasn't arguing that it should be acceptable that it's primitive. In fact, the opposite. Touch screen sensitivity and calibration issues shouldn't be that hard to rectify. Just as it shouldn't be that hard to count, keep track of and issue absentee ballots. But computers apparently break, and humans are apparently idiots, so looks like we're stuck hearing stories like this, simply presented in a biased fashion by Fox News.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be completely fair, this is happening to people attempting to vote both ways, primarily because the technology is primitive and the people who run elections, usually administrators not volunteer poll workers, are exceedingly incompetent. It's kinda rare that you see human error excused because people are so eager to cry conspiracy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mitt Romney is so unpredictable and pliable that he *might* be better than Obama when it comes to marijuana crackdowns? That alone would be a dumb reason to endorse Romney, but take this statement from his campaign into account and it's even more idiotic.

"Governor Romney has a long record of opposing the use of marijuana for any reason. He opposes legalizing drugs, including marijuana for medicinal purposes. He will fully enforce the nations drug laws, and he will oppose any attempts at legalization."
