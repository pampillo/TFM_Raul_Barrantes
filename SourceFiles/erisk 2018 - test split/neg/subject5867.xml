<TITLE> The Gray Thing </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last night, I was lying on my stomach in bed, trying desperately to get to sleep. Ever since I was a kid, I always had difficulties getting to sleep to the point of my mother saying that my nights and days were always mixed up. As much as I fought against my mind, it just continued to run at full speed, thinking of everything that happened that day.

After what felt like hours of attempting to get my mind to let me sleep, I remember opening my eyes to look at the clock on the bedside table. It had just reached 2 in the morning and as I stared angrily at the clock, I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. The same feeling you get when there's someone staring at you from across a room.

I held my breath as I slowly turned my body around to see what was behind me and almost screamed when I saw a figure standing in the doorway of the kitchen. As it was standing in front of the light I always kept on at night, I could almost make out this thing's features. It had the body of a thin man, but the more I stunningly stared at it, the more I realized this... thing wasn't a man.

It stood at a length that would make a basketball player jealous, looking as if it had been stretched. Its skin appeared to be grey with a few black splotches randomly placed on its body. After staring at this thing for what felt like centuries, it began to move towards me. I tried to scream and run away from it, but it felt like someone had strapped me to my bed and glued my mouth shut. I was completely helpless to do anything but watch as the thing stepped closer.

As it began to draw near, I noticed its face or lack of one. It seemed to be hiding its face behind what appeared to be a red wooden mask that was curved around the top, making it seem like the thing had horns. I couldn't do anything as it got closer to me and leaned down until I was face-to-mask with it. It then grabbed the bottom of my head in its clawed hands and turned it to the side and whispered something that I will never forget as long as I live.

"If you close your eyes before 4, I will kill you."

Its voice sounded raspy, as if it had been smoking a pack a day for its entire life. And then as quickly as it appeared, it completely vanished. As soon as it was gone, I finally had control of my body once again. I jumped out from under the covers and grabbed the baseball bat that I always kept underneath my bed and wandered around my house, clutching the bat as I turned every corner. But as much I tried, I wasn't able to find this thing anywhere.

After turning the house upside-down several times, I finally gave up and lied back down onto my bed. Glancing at the clock, I saw that it was now 3:25. And as much as I wanted to close my eyes to try to slip into sleep and forget what had just happened, I remembered the being's threat, which forced me to stay awake. I spent my time, staring at the clock and as soon as it turned 4:01, it felt like my mind and body were turned off and my head fell onto the pillow.

I'm writing this to have an account of what happened to me and that if anything happens to me, my friends and family will understand what occurred. 

But now, I'm terrified to go to sleep, even for a nap, just in case the thing comes back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was playing the original BOI and trying to get to the fight with Mother because I'm not all that great at Isaac right now. But I heard from people that Rebirth was really good and fixed the major slowdown issue, which has caused many deaths.

But I also heard that it's a bit easier, so I was curious if the community would recommend getting Rebirth now or wait until I, at least, defeat Mom.

Sorry if this is annoying, I just figured this would be the place to ask. </TEXT>

I have no friends, so I'm just going to be stuck at my dad's place, doing nothing. There's nothing going on in my life that makes me want to continue, other than my sister's wedding in a few weeks and a few movies, but other than that, there's nothing.

I just wish there was a way to forward to the end of it all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've recently been diagnosed as schizophrenic by a psychiatrist and for the past month, she's put me on Risperdal. For as long as I can remember, I've heard two male voices command me to do things. 

But the past couple of weeks, I've been hearing a female voice, but unlike the others, it's not yelling commands, it's screaming and asking for help. At first, I ignored it cause I live on a loud campus, but I was just lying in bed, watching a movie and I heard her scream for me to come help her. But no one was around.

I'm honestly kind of freaked out right now and I was wondering if anyone else has ever experienced another voice suddenly appearing. </TEXT>

I realized while talking to my friends and roommates that I was feeling grossed out by them talking about sex. At first, I thought it was because of a bad experience with an ex-bf, but when I tried imaging having sex with someone else, I felt really grossed out. Then I went on the internet and everything made complete sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a 20 year old guy who is just about to start my second year of college and about to continue a program that I hate and only doing it to please my mother.

And I was expecting to enjoy a nice summer vacation without much stress, only to discover that my parents are breaking up and that we're losing the house. So for the entirety of my summer, it's been the stress and shock of that, plus moving, and dreading going back to school.

The only way that I can find to deal with everything is to cut myself. I used to hide my scars, but after awhile, I decided to show them in a stupid way to get sympathy from my mom, only for her to either ignore them or joke about it.

The only thing that was stopping me from taking my life this summer was thinking about my few friends and my sister, and ignoring the thoughts by watching YouTube videos   movies. But my mom took away all of my movies and lowered the internet, so I can't watch anything on it. 

I've been feeling depressed for the majority of my life and right now, I feel like everyone would be better off and happier if I wasn't in their life at all.

Sorry for the long post, I just don't know what to do anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I decided to go outside tonight, typically I dont go out at night, but I just had an argument with my mother, which ended with me leaving, slamming the door shut. I decided to walk over to the local coffee shop and enjoy the free wifi there as well as cool down. But after awhile of scrolling through Reddit, I decided that I would just continue going for a walk as I drank my iced coffee.

I left the shop and began walking down the street, still thinking about the argument. As I reached the corner of the street and I waited for the walking signal to appear to tell me to cross the street, I saw a man with his face covered in shadows, so I couldnt see his face, all that I could see of him was his yellow Hawaiian shirt. Originally, I thought it was weird that someone else would be out at a time like this, but I just shrugged it off.

But as soon as I crossed the street, he began to run towards me. I swiftly turned around and ran back across the street, not even caring to see if any cars were coming. I crossed the street and for a brief moment, I felt relieved since I figured that he wouldnt follow me across the street. Unfortunately, I was proven wrong when I turned to look over my shoulder and saw him still coming towards me.

I began to run as fast as I can, I didnt know what he wanted, but 
I didnt want to find out. I ran as fast as I could, but when I looked over my shoulder, he was right behind me, getting extremely closer. The adrenaline in my body began to run though my body even faster, making me run even faster than I thought I could.

Suddenly, I heard the sound of sirens and I looked behind me to see the guy running back away from me, he must have figured that the sirens were coming from a police car. I continued running just in case, later finding the source of the sirens coming from an ambulance that drove by. I ran all the way back home, just in case that he saw the ambulance and decided to chase after me again.

When I got home, I slammed on the front door, not wanting to waste the time to find my keys in my pocket. My mom opened the door and I rushed in, closing the door and collapsed onto the couch. I explained what happened, she recommended that I go tell the police what happened, but since I didnt exactly get a good look at his face, there probably wouldnt be anything for them to do.

But I am never going to go outside at night ever again. </TEXT>

<TITLE> First Time Flying </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-22 01:20:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was rather freaked out as the plane lifted off, as I had never been on a plane before. Apparently, I must have looked like I felt since the guy sitting beside me leaned over to talk to me.

Hey fella, you alright?

Yes, I replied, Ive just never been up in the air before.

He leaned his head back as he laughed, No need to worry about it, he said after he finished laughing, 
Ive been flying since I was 12 and every single flight that Ive been on has never failed me.

I was about to thank him for his reassurance, when he started talking again.

Well, save for that one flight, that is.

O-one flight? I stuttered, What happened on that flight?

Ysee, he began, It all started when I was just a youngn, about the same age as you seem to be. Everything seemed fine, the passengers and the stewardesses seemed to figure that this was going to be a typical flight. Suddenly, the engine conked out, sending us plummeting into the Pacific. 

Thankfully, we all had those safety belts on, well, the passengers did. The poor stewardesses and pilot did not have enough time.

I couldn't help looking down to make sure that I had been buckled in, as he continued to tell his story.

We ended up floating around on those chairs that smelled like beer and vomit, for awhile, everything was fine, that is until we got hungry. Ysee, none of us thought to pack a lunch. A few weeks later, a helicopter flew over and the pilot yelled down, asking if I was one of the survivors of the plane crash. I yelled up, letting him know that we were from the plane crash, but that I was the only one to survive.

He smiled as he finished his story, I was about to ask him some questions, when we felt the plane land. As soon as it completely landed, the stranger stood up and exited the plane. Later as I waited at the baggage claim, he walked up to me.

Too bad that we had such a safe flight. He grinned as he licked his lips, then he wandered off, while I was still in shock. 

I've never seen him again, even though it has been three years since then.  Every day, I feel fortunate for that and I pray that no one will ever end up on the same plane as him. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [TOMT] Ritual Creepypasta that would get rid of fear </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I remember reading a pasta awhile ago, that was a description of how to do this ritual that would involve lighting a candle, writing your fears on a piece of paper and leaving the candle and paper alone in a dark room.

Then you would come back later and your fears would be gone. I think I read it on the Creepypasta Wiki, if that helps. If anyone remembers the title of this, I would very much appreciate it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not really a fan of Pewds, mostly because I don't usually get his sense of humour. In this video, however, I didn't find it that uncomfortable.

I mean, sure, he's calling things "gay", but almost all of the time, he apologized for it. Keep in mind, that the majority of the jokes that he makes can be taken as offensive.

He's made jokes about black people, Asians, women,  and rape, to name a few. I don't exactly see the problem with him making jokes about a game being gay. </TEXT>
