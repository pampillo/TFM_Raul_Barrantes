<TEXT> A Deutsche Afrika Korps (DAK) trooper balanced precariously on two M24 Stielhandgranates (Hand Grenades) somewhere in the North African Desert.

The grenades wouldn't have detonated without the end cap removal and the internal cord being pulled but still a dangerous choice of seating, we think.

She heard the screen door slam and took of running for me. By the time she caught up to me, I had ran across the street (thankfully, not a busy street) and was waddling down the hallway of a local high school in just my diaper. This was in 1969. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sapper Reginald A. Stevenson (with the fuse cord around his neck) and L/Cpl. Raymond C. Mace, 2 members of the 2/13 Field Company, Royal Australian Engineers, exhausted after the initial attempt to get ashore and blow wire defences at Lingkas, on the Island of Tarakan which is off the east coast of Borneo. 30th April 1945.

The primary objective for the Allied attack on Tarakan (code-named "Oboe One") was to secure and develop the island's airstrip so that it could be used to provide air cover for subsequent landings in Brunei, Labuan and Balikpapan. The secondary objective for the operation was to secure Tarakan's oilfields and bring them into operation as a source of oil for the Allied forces in the theatre.

The task of clearing the beach obstacles at Lingkas was assigned to the 2/13th Field Company. These defences comprised rows of barbed wire, wooden posts and steel rails which extended 125 yards from the beach. At 11:00 on 30 April, eight parties of engineers went forward in LVTs and landing craft to clear the obstacles. The engineers were supported by the guns on Sadau Island and Allied warships and aircraft. Operating under Japanese fire the engineers cleared all the obstacles obstructing the landing beaches. While heavy casualties had been expected, the 2/13th completed their task without loss.

Military Medal award: 'Lance-Corporal Mace was the non-commissioned officer in command of a demolition team engaged in the breaching of underwater beach obstacles on Tarakan. Despite the intermittent fire of the enemy the working party coolly kept on and completed and sign-posted the gap in thirty five minutes. Lance-Corporal Mace then withdrew his party and went to the rescue of another party who were hampered by the depth of the mud. He attempted to carry a line to secure one of the obstacles to enable the Section to drag themselves to the proposed gap but sank in the mud and had to be dragged back. He then took his L.V.T. to the oil pier and led his party to the beach and attacked the obstacles from the shore side with success. Lance-Corporal Mace's personal endurance, courage and leadership were wholly responsible for the effective completion of the two gaps'.

(Both survived the war)

<TEXT> I'm watching 10 Cloverfield Lane and can't help but see a comparison to the online novels by Hugh Howey, [Wool](https://www.amazon.com/Wool-Omnibus-Kindle-Motion-Silo-ebook/dp/B0071XO8RA) Has anyone else read those novels and noticed the similarities? As a background(f on the synopsis)

" The world outside has grown unkind, the view of it limited, talk of it forbidden. But there are always those who hope, who dream. These are the dangerous people, the residents who infect others with their optimism. Their punishment is simple. They are given the very thing they profess to want: They are allowed outside."

And that outside is poisonous and will kill them...or will it? </TEXT>

What it states is "The husband agrees to pay the private school tuition for the minor child for so long as the Wife resides in the marital residence. Upon the sale and the Wife's vacating of the marital residence, the husband agrees and shall pay to the wife at least 900.00 per month toward the private school tuition. This amount is in addition to whatever child support shall be determined to be due at that time. </TEXT>

So all know, this isn't my father. It's the comic artist Derf Backderf. The link below is his Facebook page.

https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1683329228633449 id=100008691630090

They grew up together, in the dense neighborhood between South Main St. and Summit Lake in Akron, Ohio.  A few blocks to the south, the sprawling Firestone plant belched thick smoke and the sour smell of rubber into the air.  Noisy streetcars clattered down Long St. where the Family Backderf lived, wheels screaming as they hit the turn at the bottom of the hill. On South Main, a bustling commercial district sandwiched between the factories serviced the neighborhood population. Dad pushed a broom at Kreske's 5 10. Cliff's family ran a corner tavern, one of many in this predominantly German part of town. 

Cliff's father died horribly when Cliff was just a boy. He stumbled and fell into a vat of acid in one of the tire factories. Cliff's mother quickly got re-married, to an alcoholic brute who hated young Cliff. It got so bad at home, my Grandfather, a gruff foreman at Goodrich, took in Cliff and raised him as his own. This was the depths of the Depression and money was tight, but my Grandfather never hesitated. Cliff regarded the Backderfs as family and was forever grateful. He waxed longingly about my Grandmother's baked treats and warm hugs for the rest of his life. Dad and Cliff shared a bedroom in their teen years, and attended South High together. They were an odd match. Dad was a brainy stringbean. Cliff was a brawny extrovert. But they were brothers.

When war broke out, Cliff enlisted at 17. He was a paratrooper in the Pacific. He fought hard and lived large, the classic GI wheeler-dealer with a dozen schemes going at once. Cliff was always a guy who fully embraced life and all the good times that could be squeezed out of it, even on the front. Dad joined up a year later and served aboard the battleship USS Arkansas. After returning home, unscathed, much to the great relief of my grandmother, they both attended Akron University on the GI Bill. The family decided to move to the bucolic Lake House my grandfather bought in 1940 and leave the stink and clank of innercity Akron, but it needed to be converted from a summer cottage. The house was jacked up and Cliff and Dad spent an entire summer digging out a lower floor, by hand, pushing the dirt up the hill to dump, wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow. They'd canoe across the Lake to catch the Main St. bus for the long ride to the university. Cliff usually got home first and Dad would yell at him from the other shore, but Cliff was often fast asleep on the couch, so Dad would have to swim it, which was no fun in the Fall. We still call one of the bedrooms "Cliff's room."

Dad went on to grad school and a long career as a chemist and stayed in Akron. Cliff became a businessman, got married and raised a family and moved to California. He loved it there, living the fine life in the sunshine. He liked to call in mid-winter and describe the weather to Dad, often while noisily eating an orange he had just plucked from a tree in the backyard. He frequently visited Akron, especially in retirement, and he and Dad spent countless hours on the golf course. Last year, he and his son went to Australia together, even though Cliff's health was failing. The dude just wouldn't be stopped. 

Cliff was inconsolable when Dad died. "I've lost my brother," he sobbed when I delivered the news. 

This is my favorite photo of them, from 1938. Dad is on the left. Two teenagers with their whole lives in front of them.

Safe travels Cliff. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To add some clarity, at the time the decree was drawn up I was living on the other side of the country and not knowing when I'd be back. I couldn't afford a lawyer and the idea of a 6 year old traveling across country was not realistic, at least to me...especially since I had been in the military prior and essentially the amount of time I'd been around her amount to 2.5 years of her life. Deployments suck. 

I'm seeing what I can discover before possibly needing to hire a lawyer to amend the decree. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Here is the actresses interview regarding that scene](http://www.pamferdin.com/interview/index.html)

FB: What was it like to kiss Clint Eastwood, in The Beguiled? That's a pretty amazing scene!

Pam: Well, you know that was pretty interesting for me because I was...when he kissed me, it wasn't in the script. How we rehearsed it up to the point, where they started the camera rolling--he was supposed to cover my mouth--because I saw, apparently, I was scared and he didn't want me to scream 'cos I saw some troops coming by. So that was the way we'd rehearsed it when we were up there in the bayou, so he went over--without my knowing it--I guess he had this idea that, it might be--I don't know, a little more provocative I guess.

I don't know cos I wasn't privy to the conversation. He went over to Don Siegal, who was the director, Clint Eastwood did, and Siegal said, "Hey! Why don't you kiss her, instead of covering her mouth with yr hand?" So basically that scene, the way I looked was actually (real). They printed the first take and that look was definitely (laughs) not a put on! Because I had NO IDEA IN THE WORLD THAT HE WAS GONNA KISS ME. So I was kinda stunned! </TEXT>

<TEXT> FYI,  that's me on the right and my friend on the left. I was probably 20 at the time and this was probably spring of 1987 right before I left for Army bootcamp. Maybe earlier in 1986, but it is right around that time period.  I forgot to state in the title that it is me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd love to see more movies based upon the initial discovery of the Americas and the initial exploration of it. Think along the lines of the movie [Black Robe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdD9YUeBDlI) which is linked to the full movie.

Also, there is a book called "The Terror" which is historical fiction based upon Captain Sir John Franklin's lost expedition of HMS Erebus and HMS Terror to the Arctic in 18451848 to force the Northwest Passage.  This would make for a fascinating movie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Back in the 50's, my grandfather was putting shingles on the roof of his barn. While doing it , he slipped and rolled off the roof. On his way off the roof, he hit the curved lip on the edge and it knocked him out. He then fell 30 feet and hit the ground. My mom found him laying there, unconscious with his pipe still in his mouth. Nothing was broken. I guess when he was knocked out he completely relaxed which saved him.
Although he didn't have any broken bones, he was lucky because his landed only inches from a cement pad...and he was incredibly sore for a few weeks afterward. He was so sore that my mother told me that they had to tie a rope to the bedposts by his feet so he could pull himself up in the morning. They did call the ambulance and he was taken to the hospital just in case. After the ambulance had put him into the back of the vehicle, it wouldn't start back up so they had to use a tractor to pull it so it could pop the clutch and start it. Also, it was his favorite Corn Cob pipe.

<TITLE> 1st grade daughter is ADHD and I have some questions </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-24 00:42:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello All. First, let me introduce myself. I am a 50 year old man who has always had ADHD and am more ADD now. I've always that that issue of never really fitting in and as a result, my self esteem has always been pummeled,

Now, my 6 year old daughter has also been diagnosed with ADHD (she has both) and possibly some minor anxiety issues. Her mother and I are now divorced and I see every weekend. When we go out to do things, it always breaks my heart because she tries so hard to make friends but is always kinda shunned. And she gets really sad about it. My ex-wife also speaks of it and compares her to me and how she doesn't want my daughter to have those same alienating experiences I had.

So, I am asking for advice on how I should encourage her or make her feel better. I should know, but I'm only trying to learn.

TL;DR Daughter is ADHD, doesn't fit in. Asking for advice. </TEXT>

That winter, my brother and I were bored (my brother was in 5th grade) on a Sunday so we went to mantinee showing of Dr. Zhivago with an intermission. I just remember being mesmerized by the movie, especially the scene in the rural cottage and the freezing cold weather.

I've only watched the movie twice, but I loved that first showing. Just something about it. </TEXT>

"The only two reasons to watch this movie are on Phoebe Cates chest. This is better than the movie it copies "Blue Lagoon", but that is saying very little. The best way to watch this movie is to have your finger on fast forward. There is a lot of wasted time that will put you to sleep. Unless you are specifically interested in seeing the the reasons previously mentioned, don't bother with this mess." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I posted this before:
Back in the late 80's, I was in the Ohio Army National Guard. We were having our Annual Training up at Camp Grayling, Michigan and were involved in a long, time based vehicle movement. At the time, we drove M-113 Armored Personnel Carriers and I was a driver of one of them. We had been driving for close to 15 hours (with food and piss/stretching breaks) with no sleep when I turned my head to the left and saw an Indian in full regalia and headdress riding a horse next to our column. In retrospect, what's I find so amusing about this is that I was so tired, I didn't freak out but just smiled as though it was the most natural thing in the world.
He rode next to me for about 1 minute and then rode off into the woods. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was once a Pallbearer at a funeral in Wisconsin during the winter and it was cold as shit with alot of snow and ice on the ground. As we were carrying the coffin down the stairs, one of the pallbearers slipped and fell down which caused all of us to lose our grip and the coffin fell onto the icy sidewalk.
The thing is, it didn't just sit there on the ground but it started sliding down the front walk (the church was on a hill, in the middle of the town) and it went out the front gate. Now we are all chasing this coffin down the street and hill but the damn thing just kept picking up speed and momentum and we couldn't catch up to it.
At the bottom of the hill there was a drugstore and this coffin slid up the handicapped ramp and through the front door and slid right down the front aisle to the Pharmacy counter where it hit with some force. When it did that, the coffin lid popped open and the body flew forward against the counter, much to the dismay of the pharmacist and his employees.
Then the cadaver looked at the pharmacist and asked "Excuse me sir, do you have something to stop this coffin?". </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was a sophomore in high school, I rode my bike home for lunch during football two-a-days. As I was leaving my house, I witnessed a small Japanese car (this was early 80's) run into the front of a RTA bus. I was the second person there. The guy was all smooshed up in the front seat with his knees in his chest and was breathing fast and shallow. I reached in to comfort him and as I did, he exhaled loudly and his head turned to face me. He looked me in the eyes and died. I can still remember thinking I could see the life leave his eyes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, thank you. FYI, it is actually written in the paperwork that I am paying 0 in child support as long as I pay the mortgage and private school tuition. That will continue until the house is sold or I can't afford private school tuition. Then it will be revisited.
But thank you for your advice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, child support is 0 as I'm paying the mortgage and private school tuition. Those payments are in lieu of child support. When the house sells, child support will be revisited. That is in the decree. And I'm not paying alimony now because I really wouldn't be able to afford it with me having to pay tuition and she knows that. Plus, she's getting part of my retirement. BUT, what I am  worried about is 13 years from now her suddenly swooping down from the sky and telling me she wants all the back alimony payments. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Divorce Decree language quetion </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-13 04:50:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Virginia]  I have a pretty straightforward question regarding my
Divorce decree and paperwork. 
I just went back and read the original paperwork for the divorce, which was the property settlement agreement. In it it states that in lieu of child support, I'm paying the mortgage and private school tuition (which I am).

She is not asking for any alimony. She will receive a portion of my
Military retirement along with 50% of my retirement accounts. But my big question is a portion that is written under the title "Spousal Support". In that paragraph, it states "but shall be entitled to a reservation of spousal support for a period equal to the length of the marriage (which was 13 years). 

Does this mean that if she wants, she could retroactively come back and claim child support from me to equal that of 13 years of alimony?

Thanks for any help.  </TEXT>

His friend was driving home from a summer job in his fathers new car when he fell asleep at the wheel. As a result, he took his foot off the accelerator and started slowing down, but at the same time he leaned on the door handle. The door opened and as they didn't wear seat belts, he fell out and onto the roadway. He then woke up and watched as his dads brand new car slowly ran off the road and hit a telephone pole. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It isnt enforceable. From Title 36 and note the term "should", not "will"

171. Conduct during playing

During rendition of the national anthem when the flag is displayed, all present except those in uniform should stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. Men not in uniform should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Persons in uniform should render the military salute at the first note of the anthem and retain this position until the last note. When the flag is not displayed, those present should face toward the music and act in the same manner they would if the flag were displayed there.

172. Pledge of allegiance to the flag; manner of delivery

The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, 'I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.', should be rendered by standing at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. When not in uniform men should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Persons in uniform should remain silent, face the flag, and render the military salute </TEXT>

(also 1979-1980) He had landed on Tarawa and fought at the Chosin Reservoir. An absolute bad ass. He also wasn't shy. After practice we would take showers in those old open bay showers and grab ass like middle schoolers do. 

Then one day, he steps into the showers while we are all in there. Nothing sexual, nothing perverted. Just something that was accepted back then. Holy shit...I'll never forget that day because I was amazed at this old mans Donkey Balls. They were hanging halfway down his thighs. Man O' Man. From then on his nickname was "Donkey Balls Olsen". Tough old bastard. I miss his no nonsense approach to everything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a repost, but it fits the fainting helping discussion.  

Back in the early 60's, my grandfather was putting shingles on the roof of his barn. While doing it , he slipped and rolled off the roof. On his way off the roof, he hit the curved lip on the edge and it knocked him out. He then fell 20-25 feet and hit the ground. My mom found him laying there, unconscious with his pipe still in his mouth. Nothing was broken. I guess when he was knocked out he completely relaxed which saved him. Although he didn't have any broken bones, he was lucky because his landed only inches from a cement pad...and he was incredibly sore for a few weeks afterward. He was so sore that my mother told me that they had to tie a rope to the bedposts by his feet so he could pull himself up in the morning. They did call the ambulance and he was taken to the hospital just in case. After the ambulance had put him into the back of the vehicle, it wouldn't start back up so they had to use a tractor to pull it so it could pop the clutch and start it. Also, it was his favorite Corn Cob pipe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I worked in a locked unit of a children's home and although I never saw a poop smearer, I did witness the poop hoarder. She was a little 8 year old girl who had been severely molested by her father. We had to go through her room every few days and search for rolled balls of dry poop.
It was very, very sad. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My father told me this when I was young. He grew up on a farm back in the 40's and 50's and for the longest time they had an outhouse that was their primary bathroom. One night he was sitting in there taking a crap when he hears a voice coming from below him. It was saying very quietly "If the log rolls over, we will die". He is sitting their puzzled but he keeps hearing it over and over again "If The Log Rolls Over We Will Die"...

Now he starts to freak out so he wipes himself and runs inside and grabs the flashlight off the counter and comes back out to check it out. Only now, it is louder and more frantic **If The Log Rolls Over We Will Die.**

He crept up to the toilet hole, turned on the flashlight and slowly peered over the edge of the toilet and what he saw scared the hell out of him...

It was a bunch of ants sitting on a turd and chanting **If The Log Rolls Over We Will Die** </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was in college (This was back in 1986), I had a friend from High School visit for the weekend to hit some dorm parties. Remember, this was when the drinking age was 18.  He got absolutely shit faced and passed out on my sofa. Me being the great friend I am, I pulled out my indelible magic marker and drew all over his face, chest and arm...and then went to bed.

Sometime early in the morning he woke up and stumbled off to use the dorms bathroom (Open bay bathroom and showers). From my room down the hall I suddenly hear a monstrous scream of "WHAT THE FUCK".  Then he came back down to my room and passed out. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Making larger monthly mortgage payments than required. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-01 11:24:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm about to start a new job where my pay is increasing by about 25% and I want to make larger monthly mortgage payments.  But I've run into an issue.  Why is it that if I want to increase my mortgage payment every month to pay off the mortgage earlier, the bank calls and sends a letter or email that tells me it is not allowed but then offers me another company that specializes in helping do exactly that?  Is there any way I can get around this? 

I'm the one paying the mortgage; shouldn't I be able to pay it as I see fit as long as it is being paid in time?  Oh, and my bank is Wells Fargo. When I bought the house, it was a local bank I went through and then they sold it to Wells Fargo. </TEXT>

When I went to pick her up at her house, I walked in the front door and was greeted with a HUGE painting of Jesus.

<TEXT> I believe that everyone can teach. The tough part is being organized and following a specific training plan. I spent a small part of last year substitute teaching at a local school system (a small Alaska School System) and I have had no experience teaching. The most challenging day was when I subbed a 4th grade class. There, I had to actually teach a little bit and help the kids out with rudimentary math. It was fun and I felt as though I had actually accomplished something at the end of the day. But to do it everyday and have a training plan to put together and stick to. Well, that would be tough. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had just arrived at Great Lakes for Boot Camp (This was in 1991) and we are standing in line for our first introduction to what is known in the military as "Operation Golden Flow" or our first urinalysis test. As I'm standing in a VERY long line and tip tapping around because I have to piss so much, a guy standing behind me taps me on the shoulder and asks what we are waiting for. I look at him and tell him "A Urinalysis".

He looks at me and asks me what a urinalysis is, so I tell him "To see who has taken any drugs recently".

He nods, shrugs and says "Well, I guess I shouldn't have smoked that crack last night". He was serious. That's when I knew he wouldn't make it through boot camp.

Now, he officially wasn't fired that first day, but about 2 weeks later when his results came back he was. So yes, you can say that he was fired that first day but had to suffer for a few weeks until officially let go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On that same day in a small town in Northern Eastern Wisconsin called Peshtigo, a small fire began which then managed to wipe out not only that town but many of the local areas. The fire was so extreme that there were reports of people spontaneously turned to dust as they ran down the streets. It is called [The Great Peshtigo Fire](http://www.peshtigofire.info) and is considered the worst forest fire in American history. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [The Changeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cETMR4cUp6c) with George C. Scott. It's an older movie (1980) but holds up really well, has no CGI and has a great, menacing atmosphere to it.

<TEXT> Back in the early 80's, I had a wrestling/football coach that was an old badass Marine. Landed on Tarawa and a few other islands then fought in Korea. The kind that was old school and gave Zero Fucks.  

Now, this was in 7th and 8th grade and once in awhile, he would would shower at the same time we did. The coaches didn't have separate showers and these were the old school open bay showers. 

Well, this old man had the longest balls. We ended up calling him Donkey Balls (insert last name). What a shock to see what we'd one day become... </TEXT>

As in my voice started quivering badly and I was sweating, I felt like just yelling "Fuck All Y'all" and storming out of there. 

But I finished the brief. That night I practiced in my room and practiced and practiced until my next brief. Was I nervous? Yep, but not nearly as bad and I was that day. But practice makes perfect. </TEXT>

Well, he actually is an actor in a June release of the movie [Range 15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss63UOd4P84) and has his own YouTube channel. He's a retired Army Ranger and works with veterans, many of them disabled. His [Youtube Channel](https://m.youtube.com/user/MBest11x) has some hilarious stuff.

<TEXT> I was stationed in Jacksonville and was having some physical therapy done on my left pinky (I had surgery on a break that happened in a Rugby game). While I was there, a guy comes into the hand clinic with the fleshy part of one of his hands splayed wide open. It was such a weird thing to see. Essentially he was cleaning his pistol and forgot it was loaded and BAM, he shot the meaty part of the hand. Nothing was damaged...no nerve damage, broken bones, nothing except filleted hand meat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, the story goes that a 14 year old boy jumped from the Sioux City Plane crash right before it started tumbling and survived. Hell, even a representative from either the 82nd or 101st Airborne gave him jump wings and made him an honorary member.  From the [article](http://siouxcityjournal.com/news/a-story-of-ordinary-people-extraordinary-decency/article_7cb1529e-5458-5a2f-9970-38700534d384.html)

*Twenty years after the crash, I remember Tony Feeney, a 14-year-old Casper, Wyo., boy who was traveling alone to visit his grandmother in Chicago. During his recovery, he told me he remembered jumping from the plane just before it gouged the runway and cartwheeled.*

*His story seemed unlikely. But how could doctors explain friction burns that took the full thickness of skin from parts of his body?*

*I asked Tony what happened before he leapt from his seat and jumped.*

*The engine exploded and jolted him from this Walkman and heavy metal magazine, he told me. Terrified, he made the Sign of the Cross and started praying. When the captain told passengers to brace for landing, he started shaking. He wanted to hear his mother's voice.*

*When he had asthma attacks, his mother Mary Ellen's voice always calmed him and helped him breathe more easily. Now he wanted that "nice and soft" voice to hold him tight.*

*Whether or not Tony really jumped from the plane didn't matter. His story had truth nobody could ever question.*

*As he was falling from the sky to almost certain death, he reached inside for what he knew would always be there: his mother's love, his mother's voice. And it was there.* </TEXT>

Why is it ignored?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Happy Friday all! About 2 weeks ago I posted a question asking about tea preferences. The original thread can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/4g5dsz/english_tea_question_and_preferences/).  

I wanted everyone to know that I chose [Yorkshire Tea (Red Box)](http://imgur.com/RcP31oP). I took everyone's advice although I steeped it for 5-10 minutes as I prefer a stronger flavor, used 2% milk and not that hated and much maligned cream/half and half.  Regrettably, since I don't have regular sugar in the house, I used some Sweet and Low and it isn't horrible.

And it is really damn tasty!! Thanks everyone!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> [GA] This is interesting in regards to suing Snapchat. If she is allowed to sue them and succeeds, could this open up lawsuits against alcohol and beer companies and even re-open lawsuits against firearm manufacturers?

Does anyone know how to block one from showing up on the Front Page or All? The sub in question is r/the_Donald and even the Bernie Sanders subreddit.

<TITLE> English Tea Question and Preferences </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First off, I'm a Yank but found myself learning to really appreciate British Tea while I was deployed to Al Udeid AFB in Qatar a few years back. The Brit's that I worked with let me try some [Yorkshire Red](http://www.englishteastore.com/yoredtea80te.html) and I fell in love with its taste and since then have always tried to have some available.

That being said, what other recommendations would ya'll make when it comes to a tasty and preferably darker type of tea?  Also, how would you recommend making it? Milk vs Cream or even Half and Half, sugar vs sugar substitutes, etc, etc, etc.  Thanks!!\

Edit to add Half and Half.

Edit #2:  This has been an awesome read!! Thank you everyone for your opinions!! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'll try to make this short and sweet. Things in our marriage have been on life support for quite a while and the home environment was pretty hostile. I was constantly being shit on. That being said, I've always wanted to try to make things work, if not for us, for our daughter.  

A little over a year ago, I retired from the Navy and the only job I could find that could continue to pay all the bills and the mortgage was in Alaska (I live in Virginia). So, I moved up there and have been here since then to not include a 2 week vacation in September.

Earlier this week I was offered a well paying part time job back in the area that my family lives. When I called to talk to her about it, she told me she wanted a divorce and that if I came back home, I wouldn't be able to live in the house and would have to find an apartment, which would negate any financial gains that would come about with me moving home.

So, my question is, and I understand this isn't a legal advice sub, do any of you know if she is able to keep me out of the house that I pay the mortgage on and have in my name? The only reason she would want to do this is for the 1 year separation requirement that Virginia has but I never agreed to a legal separation. 

Thanks for any help or advice. This is very new as we have been married for 13 years. </TEXT>

<TITLE> So, I was a pallbearer at a funeral </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-18 01:46:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was once a Pallbearer at a funeral in Wisconsin during the winter and it was cold as shit with alot of snow and ice on the ground. As we were carrying the coffin down the stairs, one of the pallbearers slipped and fell down which caused all of us to lose our grip and the coffin fell onto the icy sidewalk.

The thing is, it didn't just sit there on the ground but it started sliding down the front walk (the church was on a hill, in the middle of the town) and it went out the front gate. Now we are all chasing this coffin down the street and hill but the damn thing just kept picking up speed and momentum and we couldn't catch up to it.
At the bottom of the hill there was a drugstore and this coffin slid up the handicapped ramp and through the front door and slid right down the front aisle to the Pharmacy counter where it hit with some force. When it did that, the coffin lid popped open and the body flew forward against the counter, much to the dismay of the pharmacist and his employees.

Then the cadaver looked at the pharmacist and asked "Excuse me sir, do you have something to stop this coffin?" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey all, quick backround on me. I retired from the Navy December of 2014. I found a job pretty quick and have been working for the National Weather Service in Alaska for a year. Unfortunately, I had to leave my wife and daughter back at my home of residence and desperately want to get back home.
That being said, jobs have opened at a big box store warehouse with a few being management trainee jobs. I retired from the Navy as a Chief Petty Officer and had 10 years of middle management experience. My other resumes have only been National Weather Service related so they aren't very management related. I've worked hard to demilitarize my resume but would love to have some tough love. Thank you.

My history with working out is that after I am finished, I crave carbs and sugar bad.  Therefore, I want a recovery supplement that can help my muscles recover while helping defeat that cravings.  Any suggestions? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been reading through Volume 2 and a bit of history jumped out at me. I found it fascinating. 

"I'm reading through Volume 2 where they discuss funerals and burying the dead (this is in Appalachia back in the 30's and 40's, maybe even earlier). The old timers were quoted as saying " Th'family didn't have t'pay nothin'. They dug th'grave free of charge. Men went together and dug th'grave. And you made th'buryin' clothes, and you made th'box t'be buried in, and there wasn't no payin' goin' on. Th'preacher never charged for a funeral-for preachin' a funeral. They'll charge for funerals now, preachers will. They're not supposed to. See, most preachers is paid by salary, and that's one of his jobs. he ain't supposed t'charge y'. but many of'em'll take anything". 

Isn't it something how communities pulled together for the greater good? </TEXT>

And they hauled it away to th mill
To make a coffin of pine, for that sweetheart of mine
When they cut down the ole pine tree
She's not alone in her grave tonight
For it's there my heart will always be
Tho' we drifted apart, they cut down my heart
When they cut down the ole pine
