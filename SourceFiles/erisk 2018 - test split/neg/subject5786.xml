<TEXT> Good find.  

TLDR 3 key tweets (7-9):

 "But one thing Rosenstein's letter doesn't do -- and it took me a second read to note this -- is expressly recommend Comey be fired.  Sure, it comes very, very close to doing so.  The title is "Restoring Public Confidence in the FBI" and it has language like this: "FBI is unlikely 2 regain public/congressional trust until has Director who understands gravity of mistakes   pledges never 2 repeat."

Comey could have made that pledge, I'm sure.  I hope the press notices this, too, because it raises interesting questions. </TEXT>

Also, Nunes did say Trump himself had his communications 'possibly' swept up in [incidental surveillance](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-surveillance-idUSKBN16T2GQ). </TEXT>

Comey in his testimony has come across like a man just trying to do his job, and every Republican knows how his Clinton letter boosted Trump to victory.

<TEXT>  During last years presidential campaign, Jared Kushner [reportedly made a deal](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-campaign-sinclair-broadcasting-jared-kushner-232764) with Sinclair Broadcast Group: The Trump campaign would provide Sinclairs local news stations with intimate access to the candidate, in exchange for fair coverage of the GOP nominee.

 Sinclair-owned stations and its Washington bureau scored 15 exclusive interviews with Trump over the past year, including 11 during the final three months of the campaign in critical states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio. They did 10 more with Trumps running mate, Mike Pence, from August through October, as well as 10 with Trump surrogates, primarily Ben Carson. Sinclair stations aired five such interviews with Clinton running mate Tim Kaine and two with Chelsea Clinton but none with Clinton or another top surrogate.

  Mark Hyman  a Sinclair executive and conservative commentator who appears on Sinclair stations  regularly criticized Clinton or highlighted positions favorable to Trump in his on-air commentaries. Most Americans know very little about the leaked Clinton emails, [he said in one, which aired on Oct. 27.](http://behindtheheadlines.net/102716-clinton-emails/) Major news organizations buried the most damaging. So were sharing some with you. 

 ....

 Even if Kushner hadnt held out the promise of access, Sinclair might have offered such fairness, nonetheless. The companys longtime chairman David Smith is a big-dollar GOP donor, whose family helped fund one of Trumps super-PACs. When Sinclair purchased Washington, D.C.s ABC affiliate in 2014, the networks editorial bent took a sharp right turn. And the aforementioned Mark Hyman routinely delivers conservative commentary on the local news broadcasts of Sinclair stations around the country.

 This week, Sinclair capitalized on the FCCs new laissez-faire attitude, [purchasing Tribune Media](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/business/media/sinclair-tribune-media-sale.html?_r=0) for $3.9 billion  and, thereby, claiming ownership of enough local television stations to reach 70 percent of American households. 

 Sinclair also secured the Tribunes crown jewel, WGN America, a cable network that reaches 80 million homes, just 10 million fewer than Fox News. 

This seems possibly somewhat alarming. </TEXT>

As you know, President Trump handed over business operations to his sons and that definitely means he can't access his money.  No ins, no outs.  Sorry about that.  Alternatively, he is willing to donate his entire salary as President for one year to you.  Whatever works best for both parties.  Sincerely, definitely a real lawyer Don McGahn" </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The Senate Intelligence Committee sent letters on April 28 to Page and several other former Trump campaign allies requesting records of their meetings, emails and phone calls with Russian operatives, as well as any business holdings there. Page first responded Thursday, saying that he was unfairly subjected to surveillance by Obama officials and that the evidence proving it would induce severe vomiting once the facts were made public, according to a letter obtained by CNN.

 Sundays letter went even further. Page alleged that the Obama administration committed two preliminary felonies by leaking information about his ties to Russian officials. He charged that the Obama administration unlawfully disclosed his identity in a court filing documenting his 2013 meeting with a Russian spy, where he handed over documents related to the energy business. He also accused the Obama administration of illegally leaking classified information stemming from a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court warrant against him after he left the Trump campaign last summer.

 Page called these alleged leaks abuse and said they contributed to his feeling that he should be able to come before the Senate and testify in open session, rather than do the forced labor of turning over all of the requested documents.

Full letter sent on Sunday here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6hA9HMyhEeLZWhSN2lwS1RYWjA/view

<TEXT> Frankly the only narrative being pushed here is by you.  You seem to take it as personal affront that some governments worldwide at least attempt to take care of the needs of their female citizens.

All three of those bullet points are so vague as to not be policy suggestions.  The third bullet point is exactly what I am asking you: what male-centric health programs tailored to men should our government try to implement?  

The foundation of your argument is that women live longer than men and you combine that with the fact that some governments have made attempts to take care of the unique problems that arise in the health of their female citizens to create a narrative that women are more 'advantaged' than men.  That you think women outpacing men in Australia "completing tertiary qualifications" is relevant to this discussion is further evidence of this. 

The fact is women live longer than men because of reasons biological.  If you think otherwise, some evidence would be help your cause.

Have you ever considered girls feel disadvantaged because, depending on where they were born through no fault of their own, the chances of them having full and equitable access to affordable healthcare that is specific to women, such as cancer screenings, birth control, family planning, and abortion services, varies wildly? </TEXT>

<TEXT> If the solutions are clear, what are they?

Did you look into what those three countries, Brazil, Ireland, and Australia, have specifically done, and if it has affected the longevity of males?

Because [here's a chart](http://www.prb.org/DataFinder/Topic/Rankings.aspx?ind=6) of those countries, with some others for comparison, and I'm not seeing any real benefits.

<TEXT> In that Harvard article, there are zero things in there that answer the question I asked.  The conclusion section is 10 points about how men individually can maximize their longevity.  There are zero policy suggestions

As for women living longer than men (per your quoted text, and general assertion), the conclusion halfway through the Harvard article sort of contravenes your arguments:

 The gender gap is not unique to America. In fact, every country with reliable health statistics reports that women live longer than men. The longevity gap is present both in industrialized societies and in developing countries (see Table 2). It's a universal observation that suggests a basic difference between the health of men and women. </TEXT>

But if the EC did the job it was created to do, that is to prevent "an interested and overbearing majority" and the "mischiefs of faction" from choosing someone with ["talents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity"](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp), I'm all for it.

As an aside, the word 'leader' appears in the Federalist papers 11 times - 10 times derisively - with an intent at warning the public of demagogues who would ["try to use political office to rouse the country"](http://news.usc.edu/29924/george-will-shares-his-perspective-on-politics/?view=full) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think we are definitely getting way too deep into this, but I'm not even talking about vetting at the door.  So just to clarify..

Paul Ryan has paid aides who could have noticed this trick happening, for one thing.  

If though he was somehow totally on his own, Paul Ryan has peripheral vision and functioning ears connected presumably to a functioning brain, and so unless this guy is just really deft I'm nearly certain Ryan would unconsciously register him unzipping and zipping it up immediately after.  Depending on his intelligence, he might subconsciously realize that's not a super common thing to happen compared to what happens at most photo ops, and I guess I afforded him the intelligence to meet that threshold.

If the guy had it unzipped the whole time, or left it unzipped after the photo, Paul Ryan or his aides again could simply have read the big bold text printed on the t-shirt. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  U.S. EPA fired members of a scientific advisory board yesterday.

 The agency quietly forced out some members of the Board of Scientific Counselors just weeks after leaders told them their tenure would be renewed, said Robert Richardson, an ecological economist at Michigan State University and one of those dismissed.

 The board is tasked with reviewing the work of EPA scientists and provides feedback that can be a powerful voice in shaping the agency's future research.

 ...

 The board had 18 members, including Richardson, who said he knew of at least one other member fired. Departures could reach a dozen, he said.


I'm not familiar with E E News, but looking into who they are and the author of this piece, they check out -- as does this story.

Robert Richardson is the source for this and here he is on the [EPA BOSC website](https://www.epa.gov/bosc/bosc-executive-committee-membership), although I guess not for long anymore.

<TEXT>  Senior officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services received an email in late January from a House Ways and Means Committee staffer informing them that communication between the two government entities belongs to the committee  and are therefore not subject to Freedom of Information Act requests, BuzzFeed News has learned.

 This is the second such letter that has come to light. On Thursday, BuzzFeed News exclusively reported that the chairman of the House Committee on Financial services sent a [similar letter](https://www.buzzfeed.com/maryanngeorgantopoulos/house-committee-wants-records-with-treasury-secret?utm_term=.mjRK0GL8D#.bv1MRNZmJ) last month to the head of the Treasury Department.

<TEXT> That's all perfectly rational and I agree with pretty much everything you just wrote there to one degree or another.

My argument was just that in the general situation where government workers have a TV in the workplace and wish it to be tuned to a 24-hour major news network, there is no alternative to CNN that is more neutral.  

If Obama mandated that every agency watch CNN and only CNN, I agree that would be wrong.  But as far as I read in the article, before this the TVs were not mandated to this or that station:

 The spokesperson explained that a variety of news stations run on the monitors in the common areas on campus, including CNN, MSNBC and FOX News, and that the email referenced had been sent by a customer service representative from the FDA's Office of Facilities in response to a group of employees.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> 'Successful' is Conaway's description, which probably just means they got through it without bickering. And, still no date for the open (house) hearing, but the witness list is shaping up:

 Representatives Mike Conaway, the new Republican leader of the House Intelligence Committee probe, and Adam Schiff, the top Democrat, addressed reporters together after Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey and Admiral Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, testified at a classified hearing.

 "We had a very successful hearing," Conaway said.

 Schiff said the witnesses had provided "some additional insights," and the committee was working together very well.

 Neither responded to questions.

 Schiff and Conaway later issued a joint statement on Thursday's classified hearing saying they remained committed to working with the FBI as it continues its investigation. They said they are currently sending out invitations for witnesses to testify and requesting documents.

 They said they were looking forward to the next steps of the investigation, including an open hearing with former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and John Brennan, who was director of the Central Intelligence Agency under Obama.

 Nunes canceled that hearing when it was originally scheduled in late March, frustrating Democrats, but the committee has now promised it will take place at a still undetermined date.

And a welcome reminder:

 Yates and Clapper are due to testify in the Senate on Monday. </TEXT>

It is not merely the result of intellectual sloth but of an untrained mind bereft of information and married to stratospheric self-confidence.

 ...

 What is most alarming (and mortifying to the University of Pennsylvania, from which he graduated) is not that Trump has entered his eighth decade unscathed by even elementary knowledge about the nations history. As this column has said before, the problem isnt that he does not know this or that, or that he does not know that he does not know this or that. Rather, the dangerous thing is that he does not know what it is to know something. 

 The United States is rightly worried that a strange and callow leader controls North Koreas nuclear arsenal. North Korea should reciprocate this worry </TEXT>

 The bill contains $11.4 billion in discretionary appropriations for CBP  an increase of $137 million above the fiscal year 2016 enacted level. These resources ensure the nations borders are protected by putting boots on the ground, improving technology, and stemming the flow of illegal activities in and out of the country. 

 In addition, to meet emerging needs at the border, the legislation provides $772 million in funding as requested by President Trump in his March 2017 budget amendment for improvements to and maintenance of *existing* infrastructure, technology investments, and increased Border Patrol agent hiring. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  In December 2012, NPR's Peter Overby wrote that "as the barriers crumble between policy research and partisan advocacy, the building blocks are there for DeMint and the conservative Heritage Foundation to build a powerful operation with political clout."

 Instead, many within the organization felt that DeMint had "made the think tank too bombastic and political  to the detriment of its research and scholarly aims," Politico wrote, along with the "sense that he's made the institution too much about himself."

Interesting.  So, still the primary research arm of the Republican party, but not Trump's Republican party.

 [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/the-fight-for-control-of-the-heritage-foundation/525033/?utm_source=atlfb) reported that the driving force behind DeMint's ouster was Heritage Action CEO Mike Needham, who oversees the group's 501(c)(4) political advocacy arm.

 "To the Trump-averse elements on the board, Needham has pointed to DeMint's growing coziness with the new administration as evidence that the think tank, a beacon of movement conservatism, needs a new steward. At the same time, Needham has been telling pro-Trump board members like Rebekah Mercer that Heritage needs a leader who will follow the president's leadeven going so far as to float White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, a key Mercer ally, as a potential future president, according to one source."

Never mind. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Investors looking to buy a condo at Trump Tower in the Philippines would have found, until this week, some high-powered video testimonials on the projects [official website](http://www.trumptowerphilippines.com/).

 There was Donald Trump, in a message filmed several years before he was elected president of the United States, declaring that the skyscraper bearing his name near the Philippines capital would be something very, very special, like nobodys seen before. Then there was his daughter Ivanka Trump, now a senior White House adviser, lavishing praise on the project as a milestone in Philippine real estate history.

 After The Washington Post inquired Monday about the use of the Trumps in promoting the Manila project, the links and videos on the corporate website could no longer be accessed. Nonetheless, their lingering connection to the propertys sales pitch shows how difficult it is to separate the president from Trump-branded projects, particularly in foreign markets where there is less oversight of how his image is used. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The Senate has confirmed 26 of Trumps picks for his Cabinet and other top posts. But for 530 other senior-level jobs requiring Senate confirmation that are empty, the president has advanced just 37 nominees, according to data tracked by The Washington Post and the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Services Center for Presidential Transition. These posts include the deputy and undersecretaries, chief financial officers, ambassadors, general counsels and heads of smaller agencies who run the government day-to-day.

 Thats less than half the nominees President Barack Obama had sent to the Senate by this point in his first term.

 Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who has publicly expressed frustration with the process, has routinely peppered the White House Personnel Office for updates and called Trump directly to press for faster action on filling vacant jobs at the Interior Department, said two people familiar with his contacts, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity for this report because of the sensitivity of hiring discussions.

Interesting bit here:

 But the nomination process has also been slowed by the unusual degree of scrutiny the White House is giving job candidates. Prospective nominees for senior posts and even some of the more junior ones must win approval from competing camps inside the White House, according to close Trump associates and Republican lobbyists.

 Around the table for weekly hiring meetings are chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, representing the populist wing; Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, leading the establishment Republican wing; White House Counsel Don McGahn; Pences chief of staff Josh Peacock; and Jared Kushner, the presidents son-in-law and senior adviser, representing a business-oriented faction, according to a lobbyist and several White House officials. For economic appointments, Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, also sits in, as does the presidents daughter, Ivanka Trump, when a hiring decision piques her interest.

 "We make sure the people involved in hiring decisions dont have an objection, Priebus said. To get to that point, youve gone through a long process. If someone has a serious objection, unless it can be resolved, its probably not going to move forward.

 One area where Trump has been productive, by historical standards, is executive orders. He has released 25 executive orders, more than the past two presidents at this time.  (At 100 days, Obama had 19 orders and Bush had 11.) 

 Trump has also declined to pursue his pledges to investigate or "prove" his own conspiracy theories.

 Finally, on inspection, some Trump orders amount to little more than optional advice for the government  not binding reforms. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  President Obama, according to the Times sources, thought that acknowledging Russias attempted interference would not counteract their influence, but magnify it, causing American voters to doubt the elections legitimacy. Then candidate Donald Trump was already loudly and frequently claiming, without evidence, that the election was rigged, and the White House did not want to be seen as stepping in on behalf of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.

 Obama shot down the op-ed plan, but the administration did not permanently dismiss the idea of alerting Americans to Russias interference, they just decided the first news of it shouldnt come from Comey, on his own in the press, before a formal intelligence assessment could be completed. Comey, having already created an election controversy by publicly shaming Clinton earlier in the summer over her use of a private email server while Secretary of State, apparently thought he was uniquely credible to discuss the Russian efforts. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  President Donald Trump expressed confidence Thursday in Congress ability to pass both legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare and a spending bill to avoid a government shutdown next week.

 He also predicted that health care legislation would pass "next week or shortly thereafter.

 I wanna get both, Trump told reporters. Are you shocked to hear that?

 Were doing very well on health care. Well see what happens, Trump said. But this is a great bill, there's a great plan and this will be great health care. Its evolving.

 This has really been two months, and this is a continuation. And the plan gets better and better and better, and its gotten really, really good, Trump said. And a lot of people are liking it a lot. We have a good chance of getting it soon. Id like to say next week, but it will be  I believe we will get it, and whether its next week or shortly thereafter.

Everything with this guy is a big blustery promise that is simply unfeasible.  It's always 'coming soon' and 'evolving' and we're always waiting to 'see what happens' which is usually nothing or just abject failure despite consistently being described as something 'a lot of people are liking a lot'.

Ask yourself, if a con-man became President, how would he act?  Because I'd argue exactly like this. </TEXT>

 McCord is a career civil servant who became acting assistant attorney general in charge of the national security division in October, when John Carlin, an Obama appointee, resigned.  

 McCord [has] been helping oversee the Justice Departments probe into Russian interference

 In March, McCord announced the indictment of  two Russian intelligence officers and two hackers accused of accessing Yahoos network and the contents of webmail accounts. At a press conference, McCord said that Yahoo hacking case was a separate investigation from the hacks of the Democratic National Committee. Thats an ongoing investigation, she said of the D.N.C. matter.

 On April 12, a spokesman for former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort said that after consulting with federal authorities about whether he should register as a foreign agent because of his past work in Ukraine, Manafort would be taking "appropriate steps."

 Many took that to mean Manafort was about to register as an agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

 However, when NBC News asked spokesman Jason Maloni directly whether Manafort was going to register, Maloni wouldn't say yes or no. 

 A week later, there is no record of any filing on the Justice Department's website. Maloni told NBC News, "I don't have an update." </TEXT>

<TEXT> This article is an condensed transcript of [an informative episode of a Slate podcast](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/trumpcast/2017/04/the_impeachable_offenses_of_donald_trump.html) of an interview with Noah Feldman, a constitutional law professor at Harvard Law School, on the three areas Trump *made himself* vulnerable to impeachment.

I've further shortened it to fit in one comment and added the two quotes in the first part.

#### Background

 Theres an instinct that it must be about crimes that are on the books, violations of statutes. That is exactly what it doesnt mean, because the word high modifies both crimes and misdemeanors. High crimes and misdemeanors was a technical term that the Framers knew from procedures that the British used for impeachment, and high means governmental or in connection with, in our case, the presidency. **High crimes and high misdemeanors are actions performed in an official capacity by a government official that violate the basic principles of the government** and that therefore subject you to impeachment. They dont have to be actual crimes that are on the statute books at all.

 The real purpose of impeachment at the deepest level is for Congress to express its beliefs about what the right way to be president is with respect to respect for democracy and the rule of law.

Quote from [Justice Joseph Story written in his Commentaries on the Constitution in 1833](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/watergatedoc_3.htm) about how Impeachment applies to offenses of "a political character":

 "Not but that crimes of a strictly legal character fall within the scope of the power; but that it has a more enlarged operation, and reaches, what are aptly termed political offenses, growing out of personal misconduct or gross neglect, or usurpation, or habitual disregard of the public interests, various in their character, and so indefinable in their actual involutions, that it is almost impossible to provide systematically for them by positive law They must be examined upon very broad and comprehensive principles of public policy and duty. They must be judged of by the habits and rules and principles of diplomacy, or departmental operations and arrangements, of parliamentary practice, of executive customs and negotiations of foreign as well as domestic political movements; and in short, by a great variety of circumstances, as well those which aggravate as those which extenuate or justify the offensive acts which do not properly belong to the judicial character in the ordinary administration of justice, and are far removed from the reach of municipal jurisprudence".

In Federalist No. 65, [Hamilton defined](http://www.crf-usa.org/impeachment/high-crimes-and-misdemeanors.html) impeachable offenses as

 Those offences which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.

#### 1. Corruption

 Corruption is absolutely at the core of what high crimes and misdemeanors are because corruption means youre gaining something, typically personal, from the fact that you have this government job. His children are still running the business. Its not like he distanced himself or put himself in a blind trust. Arguably, that is itself a form of public corruption. Whether thats impeachable I think would be a debatable question.

 Foreign officials [are] staying in [his] hotels in order to, essentially, get money to the president, that looks like a violation of the Emoluments Clause, and it definitely looks like a form of insidious corruption. Trumps whole business model is based on the branding, and the brand itself has presumably, pre-impeachment, increased in value by virtue of his becoming president.

 Charging more [at his businesses] means something also because its a way to quantify, in economic terms, the gain that the president got from getting elected president. **If you look at the price a room in that hotel with no Trump as president, and you compare it to the price with him as president, the difference between the two prices is the bump he got from becoming president**. In some way, that could stand in for the degree of public corruption. I think one way that he couldve avoided this was not to raise prices in the hotels.

#### 2. Abuse of Power

 Abuse of power is anything the president does that he can only do by virtue of being president that threatens the basic freedoms and capacities of other people.

 Let me take a very concrete example. When Trump tweets that [Obama] has committed at least an impeachable offense and probably also a crime by wiretapping him, hes making an allegation that as president has weight and capacity that it wouldnt have if he were a private actor. And whats more, because he is the head of the DOJ, hes threatening somebody with the possibility of prosecution. Thats something that you can only do if youre president, and if you are doing that without evidence and in order to advance your own interests, thats a classic example of an abuse of power.

 He just did it the other day again with Susan Rice...That could trigger an investigation of the person. **That means that the exact statement with the same exact words have a different effectI would say an unconstitutional effectbecause theyre said by a person who is in fact the president at the time**. Thats where I would draw the line very, very clearly.

 Doesnt the president have free speech? And my answer to that is no. Under impeachment, no ones going to put the president in jail for what he said, but when it comes to removing the president from office, he cant say, Well, that was just me exercising my free speech. Free speech says that Congress cant make a law punishing you for speaking, but it doesnt say that it cant impeach him for things that hes said. Hes not immune from impeachment. I think thats sort of the punchline. The president is never immune from impeachment.

 And saying that all of your political opponents, at one point or another, belong in jail [absolutely crosses the line]. Its great to have free speech values, and Trump should never be put in jail for things that hes said. I would very strongly defend his free speech rights repeatedly, and with my nose held during the campaign, but its not true that hes immune from being impeached.

#### 3. Undermining the Rule Of Law

 Assume for the sake of argument that it could be shown that the president or people very close to him cooperated with Russia in hacking the Democrats during the election. Technically thats conduct that happened before the election, so to that extent the president could make a plausible argument that it shouldnt be considered in his impeachment.

 But [e]lections are the most basic component we have of democracy, and to corrupt those elections by colluding with a foreign power and then give them something back I think would certainly count. Again, if the president did this while he was in office, he would obviously be impeachable for that. Its a little trickier with respect to conduct that happened before because remember in our definition high crimes and misdemeanors are abuses of the office, so if youre not in office, it might be criminal to take action, but it might not be technically impeachable.

 Now, in the real world this may not matter. It may be that if evidence that comes out thatll be good enough for Congress, but I would certainly think that subverting the election process is a good example of subverting democracy, so at least we should start there.

 I would add with that the systematic attack on the press. The press is in the Constitution. Members of the press are not part of the government, but that doesnt mean they dont fulfill the role of a core constitutional function. Calling them the Fourth Estate is a metaphor, but in an important way its also true that **the press is essential to the functioning of democracy**. The Framers knew that, and **thats why they gave the press special protection in the Constitution**. Without them, without a free press, you dont have a functioning democracy. There are no examples in the world of functioning democracy without a free press.

 Trump doesnt have to bend over backward to say how much he loves the press, but it includes not taking actions that are effectively intended to curtail press freedoms, to frighten the press, especially through corporate pressure, into ceasing to be effective critics. That is how democracy erodes. That may make people uncomfortable, but I think its making people uncomfortable because **theyre mistakenly taking the free speech paradigm of the First Amendment and applying it supervision of the president through impeachment**. This is not about punishing the president; its about assuring that the governmental system that respects a free press continues.

#### Closing

 I dont think that Trumps activities are so ordinary that going after him would set a precedent for everybody in office being sought for impeachment. Were talking about concrete enrichment of the president while in office, which has not been the case for other people and is unlikely to be the case for other presidents in the future. Were talking about abuses of power with respect to allegations of crimes that have never been undertaken, to my knowledge, by any president in this way. And if something to do with the Russian allegations is shown, were also talking about a form of corruption of the democratic process that, with the exception of Nixon, has not been shown of a sitting president. You have to focus on these cases because **if you dont use the impeachment process now, there is a question of whats the point of having it at all**. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Bill OReilly has been subjected to a brutal campaign of character assassination that is unprecedented in post-McCarthyist America, Marc E. Kasowitz said in a statement Tuesday, according to CNN. 

What is "post-McCarthyist America" and why is it a term actually being used in a press brief from a law firm?

 This law firm has uncovered evidence that the smear campaign is being orchestrated by far-left organizations bent on destroying OReilly for political and financial reasons. The evidence will be put forth shortly and is irrefutable.

The WH tried to insist they were moving on from healthcare after their bill failed but the rest of the GOP won't let them, and now Trump's made it worse by just snubbing the insurers.

 A CMS official confirmed that Verma did not comment on the payments, called cost-sharing reductions, at the meeting and told those gathered that it was a decision to be made by Congress.

 Trump told the Journal that he and Congress would both have to approve the payments.

 Otherwise, those payments dont get made and Obamacare is gone, just gone, Trump said. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Condensed, with link to referenced report from Washington Post:

 To make health care more affordable for low-income Americans, the Affordable Care Act provided insurers with cost-sharing reductions  federal payments that defray the cost of deductibles and co-pays for more than 7 million Americans.

 That was the Obama administrations plan at least. House Republicans, however, claimed that the law didnt actually authorize the executive branch to make those payments without an additional congressional appropriation. A federal judge agreed, but that judge also ruled that the administration could carry on making the payments while it appealed the decision to a higher court.
 
 This has left a cloud of uncertainty over the American health-care system ...

  Last week, president Trump told The Wall Street Journal that he was considering withholding those payments, in order to force Democrats to play ball on Obamacare repeal. Specifically, Trump suggested that once he deliberately undermines Americas insurance markets and people start losing their coverage, then Democrats will be desperate to vote for his health-care plan  because everyone will blame Democrats for what he did.  
 
 I dont want people to get hurt, Trump told the paper. What I think should happen  and will happen  is the Democrats will start calling me and negotiating.  They own Obamacare.  
 
 These remarks made insurers nervous. And on Tuesday, executives from several of Americas leading health insurance companies came to Washington to meet with Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. At that meeting, they sought reassurance that the administration would continue to provide cost-sharing reductions next year. They received [none.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/04/18/health-insurers-asked-the-trump-administration-for-reassurance-on-obamacare-they-didnt-get-it/?utm_term=.6e0eb66a2c76) </TEXT>

<TEXT> What, you think they'd just throw it away?

 The FBI last year used a dossier of allegations of Russian ties to Donald Trump's campaign as part of the justification to win approval to secretly monitor a Trump associate, according to US officials briefed on the investigation.

 This includes approval from the secret court that oversees the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to monitor the communications of Carter Page, two of the officials said. Last year, Page was identified by the Trump campaign as an adviser on national security.  
 
 Officials familiar with the process say even if the application to monitor Page included information from the dossier, it would only be after the FBI had corroborated the information through its own investigation. The officials would not say what or how much was corroborated.  

 US law enforcement and intelligence officials have said US investigators did their own work, separate from the dossier, to support their findings that Russia tried to meddle in the 2016 presidential election in favor of Trump.

 Comey hasn't mentioned the dossier in all his briefings to lawmakers, according to people familiar with the briefings. To some of them, he has emphasized that the FBI gathered evidence as part of its investigation to support seeking FISA court approval and to take other steps as part of the probe that began last July, according to the officials briefed of the probe.

Also, if you want to see the Federal complaint against 3 SVR operatives where Carter Page is cited as "Male-1", I'll just leave [this here](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/1509342/buryakov-et-al-complaint.pdf) as it's mentioned in the article at the end:

 The FBI became interested in Page, the officials say, in part because of concerns about his interactions with suspected Russian intelligence operatives last year. The Justice Department and FBI haven't accused Page of wrongdoing and it's unclear whether any charges could be brought in the investigation.

 The FBI already knew about Page because of his role as a witness in the 2013 federal prosecution of an undercover Russian spy. Prosecutors alleged that the spy had tried to cultivate Page as a source. Page denies he knew he was interacting with a Russian spy. </TEXT>

Also, why would the US congratulate Erdogan personally?  He didn't win an election himself, and he held a referendum (always a bad idea) during a state of emergency when freedom of speech and assembly was curtailed, and it was for something as huge as completely altering the constitution. And Trump congratulated him for this.

 Among the public overall, 62% say they are bothered a lot by the feeling that some corporations dont pay their fair share of taxes, and 60% say the same about some wealthy people not paying their fair share.  
  
 About four-in-ten (43%) say they are bothered a great deal by the complexity of the system. But with the April 18 tax filing deadline approaching, only about a quarter (27%) say they are bothered a lot by the amount they pay in taxes.

<TEXT>  But you have no problem with the press degrading and defaming a sacred part of our republic, and will even want Trump impeached for calling them out for doing that.

You're making assumptions on what precisely is true and what is not.  Initially, I was simply responding to the headline's question, "Could Trump be impeached for bashing the press?".  And hypothetically, I was trying to explain, with a different Congress, the answer is yes.  Realistically with our Congress, you're trying to argue, the answer is no.  That's fine with me, I just feel like you haven't really been understanding what I've been trying to explain (poorly I guess), which is impeachment is a political process and is based on a mercurial term that encompasses a very broad range of charges including ones based on the collective subjective judgment of the Congress.  This was stated more or less in one of the articles I cited.

 Impeachment, as Justice Joseph Story wrote in his Commentaries on the Constitution in 1833, applies to offenses of "a political character":  
  
 "Not but that crimes of a strictly legal character fall within the scope of the power; but that it has a more enlarged operation, and reaches, what are aptly termed political offenses, growing out of personal misconduct or gross neglect, or usurpation, or habitual disregard of the public interests, various in their character, and so indefinable in their actual involutions, that it is almost impossible to provide systematically for them by positive law They must be examined upon very broad and comprehensive principles of public policy and duty. They must be judged of by the habits and rules and principles of diplomacy, or departmental operations and arrangements, of parliamentary practice, of executive customs and negotiations of foreign as well as domestic political movements; and in short, by a great variety of circumstances, as well those which aggravate as those which extenuate or justify the offensive acts which do not properly belong to the judicial character in the ordinary administration of justice, and are far removed from the reach of municipal jurisprudence".[1](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/watergatedoc_3.htm) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Pointing out a violation of the public trust can't itself be considered a violation of the public trust.

It is when it's a false claim and especially if it was done knowingly with actual malice.  Then he would be abusing his power and authority as President and violating the public trust to degrade and defame a sacred part of our republic as expressed in the first amendment.  I'm not saying it's actually going to happen or anyone is going to use it, I'm just making a claim in a hypothetical situation within our framework, it would be a possibility and I'm actually basing it on the real meaning of the words "high crimes and misdemeanors", again, as expressed in the text.

So, we're just going to have to agree to disagree. </TEXT>

 Asked about the relationship at an event in Washington, Pompeo said, "It's fantastic."  

 After the audience giggled, he added: Dont laugh, I mean that."

<TEXT> I'm just telling you the explanations I've come to understand from people who know more about this than either me or you.  They were discussing pure possibilities rather than strategic paths for anyone wishing to go down that path.  I'm just saying if you think it is as clear cut as you describe, you're definitely wrong.  I may easily be wrong, too, but it's definitely not as simple as you're making it out to be.  

His criticisms of the press are fine, but calling them "the enemy of the people" may actually cross a line where he unduly damages the (protected) press and thus society, which could be considered conduct unbecoming, intimidation, or violating a principle of the Constitution.

Because the thing is, "high crimes and misdemeanors" is a looser term than you think it is.  It has as much to do with the proper fulfillment of duties and spirit of the office, and protecting the spirit of the Constitution, as it does with actual crimes.  It's often described as a "term of art".  

Just one more time.  Last sentence is key.

 [The impeachment process is political in nature, not criminal. Congress has no power to impose criminal penalties on impeached officials.](http://www.crf-usa.org/impeachment/high-crimes-and-misdemeanors.html)

 The convention adopted high crimes and misdemeanors with little discussion. Most of the framers knew the phrase well. Since 1386, the English parliament had used high crimes and misdemeanors as one of the grounds to impeach officials of the crown. Officials accused of high crimes and misdemeanors were accused of offenses as varied as misappropriating government funds, appointing unfit subordinates, not prosecuting cases, not spending money allocated by Parliament, promoting themselves ahead of more deserving candidates, threatening a grand jury, disobeying an order from Parliament, arresting a man to keep him from running for Parliament, losing a ship by neglecting to moor it, helping suppress petitions to the King to call a Parliament, granting warrants without cause, and bribery. Some of these charges were crimes. Others were not. The one common denominator in all these accusations was that the official had somehow abused the power of his office and was unfit to serve.  
 
 After the Constitutional Convention, the Constitution had to be ratified by the states. Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay wrote a series of essays, known as the Federalist Papers, urging support of the Constitution. In Federalist No. 65, Hamilton explained impeachment. **He defined impeachable offenses as those offences which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.**

EDIT: added some more clarity as to the threshold I'm focused on. </TEXT>

From the First intercept article:

 In late 2015, the turkers began reporting that the Global Science Research survey had abruptly shut down. The Guardian had published a report that exposed exactly who the turkers were working for.**Their data was being collected by Aleksandr Kogan**, a young lecturer at Cambridge University. **Kogan founded Global Science Research in 2014*, after the universitys psychology department refused to allow him to use its own pool of data for commercial purposes. **The data collection that Kogan undertook independent of the university was done on behalf of a military contractor called Strategic Communication Laboratories, or SCL**. The companys election division claims to use data-driven messaging as part of delivering electoral success.

 **SCL has a growing U.S. spin-off, called Cambridge Analytica**, which was paid millions of dollars by Donald Trumps campaign. Much of the money came from committees funded by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, who reportedly has a large stake in Cambridge Analytica. For a time, one of Cambridge Analyticas officers was Stephen K. Bannon, Trumps senior adviser. Months after Bannon claimed to have severed ties with the company, checks from the Trump campaign for Cambridge Analyticas services continued to show up at one of Bannons addresses in Los Angeles. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're being oddly pedantic and obstinate and I don't really know why.  It's like you don't want to possibly have to learn anything or have your opinion influenced.

The press have special rights by virtue of being written into the Constitution as their rights to free speech should be inviolable and the President has a duty to uphold that and protect it.  As such the chief executive of law enforcement calling them the enemy of the people could easily be considered a high crime.  Once again:

 **A high crime is one that can only be done by someone in a unique position of authority**, which is political in character, who does things to circumvent justice.

 The phrase "high crimes and misdemeanors" when used together was a common phrase at the time the U.S. Constitution was written and **did not mean any stringent or difficult criteria** for determining guilt. **It meant the opposite**. The phrase was historically used to cover a very broad range of crimes.

 Officials accused of high crimes and misdemeanors were accused of offenses as varied as misappropriating government funds, **appointing unfit subordinates**, not prosecuting cases, not spending money allocated by Parliament, **promoting themselves ahead of more deserving candidates**, threatening a grand jury, disobeying an order from Parliament, arresting a man to keep him from running for Parliament, losing a ship by neglecting to moor it, helping suppress petitions to the King to call a Parliament, granting warrants without cause, and bribery. **Some of these charges were crimes. Others were not.**

The things I have bolded in the last paragraph (other than the last sentence): are those crimes?  are they things common persons can commit?

<TEXT> The office of President has special duties to uphold the Constitution.  Not all of his speech is protected, period.  If you would actually put in some work to educate yourself on the history of impeachment and the legal history of the phrase "high crimes in misdemeanors" to understand it's full meaning to those who live in the realm of constitutional law, you would discover it's not as simple as you want it to be.  Please re-read what I pasted.  

Do you seriously think you have a complete grasp of a phrase with centuries of history, and moreso than actual constitutional law experts?  The discussions I have listened to and articles I have read *were nonpartisan thought experiments*.  That's how intellectual conversations motivated by a desire to acquire more accurate knowledge work.

Again, if you want to continue to delude yourself into thinking you know exactly how this all works, then by all means.  Just don't reply back to me as if you aren't arguing this casually. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, that degraded quickly.  The discussions I listened to were nonpartisan, but if you want to delude yourself into thinking that "liberals still can't admit he won", go ahead.  

I take it you didn't look up what the meaning of the phrase high crimes and misdemeanors.  Allow me to do the work for you:

 **"High" in the legal and common parlance** of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries of "high crimes" signifies activity by or against those who have special duties acquired by **taking an oath of office that are not shared with common persons**.[1] A high crime is one that **can only be done by someone in a unique position of authority, which is political in character**, who does things to circumvent justice. The phrase "high crimes and misdemeanors" when used together was a common phrase at the time the U.S. Constitution was written and **did not mean any stringent or difficult criteria for determining guilt. It meant the opposite**. The phrase was historically used to cover a **very broad range of crimes.**  
 
 The constitutional convention adopted high crimes and misdemeanors with little discussion. Most of the framers knew the phrase well.[citation needed] Since 1386, the English parliament had used the term high crimes and misdemeanors to describe one of the grounds to impeach officials of the crown. *Officials accused of high crimes and misdemeanors were accused of offenses as varied as misappropriating government funds, appointing unfit subordinates, not prosecuting cases, not spending money allocated by Parliament, promoting themselves ahead of more deserving candidates, threatening a grand jury, disobeying an order from Parliament, arresting a man to keep him from running for Parliament, losing a ship by neglecting to moor it, helping suppress petitions to the King to call a Parliament, granting warrants without cause, and bribery.* **Some of these charges were crimes.

<TEXT> I'm basing this off of discussions from experts on constitutional law that I have listened to.  Sure, they could be wrong, but the arguments sounded reasonable to me.  Can you go look up the full meaning of the phrase high crimes and misdemeanors in relation to articles of impeachment?

<TEXT> I'm not trying to let him off the hook for perjury.  But I think you understand my overall point.  

Bashing the free press, specifically to the degree of calling them the enemy of the people, has the potential for impeachment because it can be argued it is a "high crime [and] misdemeanor" under the historical nature of the phrase and because the press is in the Constitution explicitly.

Specifically, it can be argued it is an abuse of power, dereliction of duty, conduct unbecoming, or intimidation.  

And just as an aside, his claims that Susan Rice committed a crime as NSA and that Barack Obama personally directed an illegal wiretap of him are both "abuses of power" if the claims are untrue (and it appears they are 
indeed false). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey look, another Trump adviser with a crystal ball.  With all the Trump-Russia information dropping today this may get lost in the noise, but this is some good work by Reuters.  

 Billionaire investor Carl Icahn's oil refining company, CVR Energy (CVI.N), made a massive bet in 2016 that prices for U.S. government biofuels credits would fall - just before Icahn started advising President Donald Trump on regulations driving that market.

 The size and specifics of the gamble - involving $186 million worth of biofuels credits the company said it needed at the end of 2016 to satisfy regulatory requirements - have not been previously reported by the media.

 The credit system is designed to encourage the mixing of renewable fuels, such as ethanol, into gasoline or diesel. The government awards the biofuels credits to firms that produce such blends - and requires firms that dont, such as CVR, to buy the credits from their competitors.

 Icahn's firm positioned itself to slash those regulatory costs by tens of millions of dollars if biofuels credit prices declined, according to a Reuters review of CVR filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and interviews with two brokers involved in the firms trading of biofuels credits.

 Last year, in a counterintuitive trading strategy, Icahns refining firm postponed buying biofuels credits and instead sold millions of them  a bet that it could buy the credits it would need later at lower prices, according to the two brokers and CVRs year-end SEC filing.

 That strategy looked prescient, starting in December, as prices for biofuels credits fell in response to a series of political events tied to the election of Trump. These included his appointment of Icahn - a vocal critic of biofuels credit mandates - as an unpaid special advisor to the President on regulatory issues. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  A one-time foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump's presidential campaign lashed out at the "Clinton/Obama regime" after a report published Tuesday said he was the subject of a secret surveillance warrant seeking information about his possible collaboration with Russians to manipulate the 2016 election.
 
 Carter Page told NBC News late Tuesday that he felt he was being targeted because of his support for the Republican presidential candidate and now president.
 
 "There had been prior reports, but I was so happy to hear that further confirmation is now being revealed. It shows how low the Clinton/Obama regime went to destroy our democracy and suppress dissidents who did not fully support their failed foreign policy," Page said.

Amateur gaslighting.  Hasn't anyone told him yet it'd probably be a good idea to stop giving interviews? </TEXT>

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_cyanide#cite_note-48

Zyklon B, or Hydrogen Cyanide, is a Schedule 3 chemical in the Chemical Weapons Convention.  Do you know it took me about 2 minutes to get this information?

Moreover, using pure deductive reasoning, if a man-made chemical can hurt someone, and someone uses it against another person, that's using a chemical weapon.  If I blast you in the face with RAID, you've just got hit with a chemical weapon.  Where international organizations classify it for scheduling is a different matter, but regardless, Zyklon B is most certainly a chemical weapon.

<TEXT> The same thing can be said for their handling of Syria.  They draw the line at chemical attacks, but Assad is free apparently to bomb Syrian civilians with conventional weapons to his heart's content.  It's sanctimonious and abhorrent.

 What's disturbing is it seems he was sent out quickly to "Make a case for Asad being the worst guy ever"

<TEXT> Link to letter from Menendez to Mnuchin: https://www.menendez.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Mnuchin-PdVSA-Rosneft-Letter-FINAL.pdf

 Menendez formally asked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to proactively monitor a loan that Rosneft, an oil company majority-owned by the Russian government, has provided to Citgo Petroleum Corp.s parent company.

 Petrleos de Venezuela, Venezuelas state-owned oil company, used 49.9 percent of Citgos shares as collateral for a loan.  
 
 If Venezuelas economic crisis continues and the company defaults, Menendez said Rosneft may take control of the shares, which would combine with the Russian companys other interests in the company to give it majority control.

 This could leave Rosneft, a Russian company controlled by oligarchs with close ties to [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, in control of critical energy infrastructure in the United States, Menendez told Mnuchin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow Jake Novak's deductive reasoning is incredibly strong.  He'd fit right in at the Trump WH:

 What a difference 24 hours and 59 Tomahawk missiles can make.

 Yesterday if you mentioned the words "Russia and Trump," you were probably having a conversation about the enduring allegations that the Russians somehow colluded with the Trump campaign and that they somehow tipped the 2016 election.

 But now those words are likely a part of a conversation about how President Donald Trump broke with Russia in his decision to respond to the alleged Syrian nerve gas assault on its own people with Thursday night's missile strike.

 ....

 Again don't be fooled, President Trump's opponents are still angry as ever and many of them will use this missile attack to form a new series of political attacks against him. But now they have to start over and their range of attack has been significantly narrowed. In fact, in light of President Trump's clear challenge to the Russians, a good case can be made to end the House Intelligence Committee's hearings and ranking member Adam Schiff's crusade to uncover some kind of Trump-Russian grand conspiracy. Something else will catch the Democrats' anti-Trump fancy to be sure, but it will have to be something else.

His argument is, essentially, that you'll see more than just articles about his ties to Russia when you search for the keywords 'Trump' and 'Russia' now and that means Democrats are a bunch of losers and the House IC should cancel their investigation. </TEXT>

 U.S. President Donald Trump suggested on Twitter that the runway itself had not been the target of the missile strikes.
 
 "The reason you don't generally hit runways is that they are easy and inexpensive to quickly fix (fill in and top)!", he said.
 
 A senior military source in the alliance fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad said the airbase had been mostly evacuated thanks to a warning from Russia, which has deployed its military to Syria in support of Assad.

 The senior military source, a non-Syrian, said only a few out-of-service jets were destroyed.

<TEXT>  Justice Department attorneys are asking the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to delay oral arguments scheduled for later this month in a lawsuit challenging the Obama rule, while the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reviews the regulation and its position on it.

 Under the Obama administration, attorneys were defending the pollution rule against a coalition of business groups and conservative states, led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  
  
 The regulation lowered the allowable concentration of ozone to 70 parts per billion, from the previous 75. Ozone is a byproduct of pollutants from burning fossil fuels and a component in smog. It is linked to respiratory ailments like asthma attacks.

Reduction from 75 to 70 parts per billion apparently is Pruitt's definition of an 'activist agenda'.  Unlike this 'coalition of business groups and conservative states' led by the totally sane U.S. Chamber of Commerce, of course.   </TEXT>

This is for legislation, to be clear.  They're not looking to undo the vote from yesterday which would be laughably transparent.

 A bipartisan group of 61 senators sent a letter to Senate leaders Friday urging them to maintain the 60-vote threshold for filibusters involving legislation, which they said is needed to ensure bipartisanship remains a component of passing bills through the chamber.

 The signatures of 28 Republicans, 32 Democrats and one independent is evidence that a broad mix of senators will back the filibuster for legislation.

And just to compare to yesterday's vote:

 #####Vote to keep the 60 vote threshold  
To block the nuclear option, 51 votes needed

  | Yay | Nay
---|---|----|----
Republicans | 0 | 52
Democrats | 48 | 0
Total | 48 | 52

<TEXT> OK, so for the record, McConnell "expects" Trump is legally justifying this through the AUMF:

 It was perfectly executed and for the right purpose, McConnell told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt Friday morning.  
 
 I support totally what the president did  a precision strike to make it clear to Assad that the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable behavior, McConnell said. This step, of course, will be widely applauded by all of our allies, particularly our Sunni Arab allies in the Middle East who really wondered whether America could be depended upon again after eight years of Barack Obama.  
  
 I think that this is not a situation that requires an AUMF, an authorization for the use of military force, he told Hewitt. We passed one in back in 2001 and 2002, I believe, and the previous president thought that it authorized what we were doing in that part of the world and I expect this president thinks the same.

edit: Hugh Hewitt, who conducted the interview this article is drawing from, of course did not ask the question I would have liked him to ask: does the 2002-2003 AUMF actually cover use of military force against the government of another sovereign nation (and UN member-state)? </TEXT>

 The War Powers Resolution requires the President to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing armed forces to military action and forbids armed forces from remaining for more than 60 days, with a further 30-day withdrawal period, without a Congressional authorization for use of military force (AUMF) or a declaration of war by the United States. The resolution was passed by two-thirds of Congress, overriding a presidential veto. </TEXT>

 But the AUMF only covers Al Qaeda (and now somehow ISIS), so how does attacking the Syrian military fit in?

<TEXT> Here's a plausible explanation of why, from [Paul Wood's BBC article on 3/30](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39435786):

 Members of the Obama administration believe, based on analysis they saw from the intelligence community, that the information exchange claimed by Steele continued into the election.
 
 "This is a three-headed operation," said one former official, setting out the case, based on the intelligence: Firstly, hackers steal damaging emails from senior Democrats. Secondly, the stories based on this hacked information appear on Twitter and Facebook, posted by thousands of automated "bots", then on Russia's English-language outlets, RT and Sputnik, then right-wing US "news" sites such as Infowars and Breitbart, then Fox and the mainstream media. Thirdly, Russia downloads the online voter rolls.

 The voter rolls are said to fit into this because of "microtargeting". Using email, Facebook and Twitter, political advertising can be tailored very precisely: individual messaging for individual voters.

 "You are stealing the stuff and pushing it back into the US body politic," said the former official, "you know where to target that stuff when you're pushing it back."

 This would take co-operation with the Trump campaign, it is claimed.
 
 "If you need to ensure that white women in Pennsylvania don't vote or independents get pissed in Michigan so they stay home: that's voter suppression. You can figure what your target demographics and locations are from the voter rolls. Then you can use that to target your bot."

 This is the "big picture" some accuse the FBI of failing to see.
 
 It is, so far, all allegation - and not just the parts concerning Donald Trump and his people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> McConnell's handling of the situation is... interesting:

 The classified briefings that the C.I.A. held in August and September for the so-called Gang of Eight  the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and the Senate and of the intelligence committees in each chamber  show deep concerns about the impact of the election meddling.
  
 In the briefings, the C.I.A. said there was intelligence indicating not only that the Russians were trying to get Mr. Trump elected but that they had gained computer access to multiple state and local election boards in the United States since 2014, officials said.
 
 Although the breached systems were not involved in actual vote-tallying operations, Obama administration officials proposed that the eight senior lawmakers write a letter to state election officials warning them of the possible threat posed by Russian hacking, officials said.  
   
 But Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, resisted, questioning the underpinnings of the intelligence, according to officials with knowledge of the discussions. Mr. McConnell ultimately agreed to a softer version of the letter, which did not mention the Russians but warned of unnamed malefactors who might seek to disrupt the elections through online intrusion. The letter, dated Sept. 28, was signed by Mr. McConnell, Mr. Reid, Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the ranking Democrat.

EDIT: Per NYT's edit, comma added between 'resisted' and 'questioning'.  Thanks to /u/thomascj85 for pointing this out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reid changed the rules for executive nominees in 2013 after 79 votes of cloture in a row were required to be taken by Democrats to get nominees past Republican filibusters.  So Reid changed it to allow 51 votes only, and that's the precedent McConnell is referring to.  Unfortunately for him, as the Senate President has stated, that only applied to executive nominees, not SCOTUS nominees, so it's not really a precedent.

 Several leftwing activist groups have filed accusations against me with the Office of Congressional Ethics. The charges are entirely false and politically motivated, and are being leveled just as the American people are beginning to learn the truth about the improper unmasking of the identities of U.S. citizens and other abuses of power. Despite the baselessness of the charges, I believe it is in the best interests of the House Intelligence Committee and the Congress for me to have Representative Mike Conaway, with assistance from Representatives Trey Gowdy and Tom Rooney, temporarily take charge of the Committees Russia investigation while the House Ethics Committee looks into this matter.

<TEXT>  None of what you just said proves how you know for a fact the intelligence she requested to see had anything to do with Russia. You're operating purely on assumption.

What does that have to do with anything?  The NSA can request redacted names be unmasked in intelligence reports.  What does it matter if it has to do with Russia?

 She did not say at all that the intelligence she requested the unmasking of had anything to do with Russia, only "foreign officials".

Again, what does that matter?

 Huh? Not one publication I have seen reported they confirmed she did something illegal. Bloomberg and Fox are the only two major publications reporting on this at length and none of them have said that. That's provably wrong.

I'm talking about Trump's base and the fringe media outlets, not the mainstream publications.

 Oh Jesus man. Now apply that reasoning to how this sub reacts to Trump or anyone in their team lying. Every single time it's used as evidence of wrong doing. Every single fucking time.

"Every single time".  And how many times has that been exactly?  How many coincidences can you feasibly dismiss away?  Whereas for Trump's bogus claim, so far all we know is the NSA supposedly requested names be unmasked which again is legal.  And there's zero evidence she did anything improper except perhaps lie in an interview, or as Michael Flynn puts it, "gave incorrect information".

 How can you not personally realize the hypocrisy of this statement when you yourself just used Trump saying "I having nothing to do with Russia, no person that I deal with does", to deflect from this story?

Hypocrisy of WHAT statement?  That I don't immediately jump to the conclusion that Susan Rice illegally spied on the Trump campaign and then illegally leaked it to the public?

Once again, the FBI has been running a counterintelligence investigation into Trump's ties with Russia since last July.  The investigation is ongoing, which means whether or not there was collusion is the subject of an active investigation.  Are you truly suggesting to me that no information of this would EVER be fed to the NSC?

<TEXT> That may be a valid question but this is a flatly false statement:

 If there had been a real need to reveal the identities  an intelligence need based on American interests  the unmasking would have been done by the investigating agencies.

Because the NSA is legally allowed to unmask names, Susan Rice most likely unmasked many Americans names during her time as NSA.  The fact the provision for the NSA to even do so means that statement cannot be true.

Same here:

 If Susan Rice was unmasking Americans, it was not to fulfill an intelligence need based on American interests; it was to fulfill a political desire based on Democratic-party interests.

Again, because it's legal for her to do so, it's safe to assume she used that power many times.  So how can you possibly conclude this time for Trump it was politically motivated?  I completely understand how you may suspect that, but I do not understand how you conclude it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well that's just flatly false.  


From the [Eli Lake article](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-04-03/top-obama-adviser-sought-names-of-trump-associates-in-intel) which broke the story to the mainstream:
 The standard for senior officials to learn the names of U.S. persons incidentally collected is that it must have some foreign intelligence value, a standard that can apply to almost anything. This suggests Rice's unmasking requests were likely within the law.

It would be better for me to quote you the relevant law, but I'll take his word for it: NSA is able to unmask names in reports they receive.  I'm not arguing it's good, I'm arguing it's legal. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  How could you possibly no that? Up until yesterday, her story was she knew absolutely nothing about any intelligence collection on the Trump campaign.

I know that the FBI has been running a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's ties with foreign officials from Russia since last summer because that's what Comey stated, and I know that the FBI shares information with the NSC.  I don't know for a fact that she was reading reports coming from the IC, but since she confirmed she requested names unmasked in relation to the investigation, I figured it was safe to assume she was.

 Because the 4th amendment in this country has been shit on and lit on fire the past 16 years so it's "legal" to do whatever the fuck you want.

I'm not going to argue with you on that.  The sentiment rings true.

 I also never said it was illegal, only that Susan Rice is a liar, which I just proved.

Fair enough, but that's not the angle the current scandal is running with because most are implying or directly stating this is evidence of some wrongdoing.  The lying in an interview could be a wrongdoing, sure, and it raises a very slim possibility that it is indicative of something sinister underneath, but it's certainly not on the surface. </TEXT>

It's certainly not a 'completely different issue'.  I'm just trying to figure out what I should be defending her from because it's not illegal for the NSA to request masked names to be unmasked.  

To be clear, I don't feel the need to defend any alleged instance of her lying about not unmasking the names.  Until there's some sort of evidence that she leaked the names, I'm not sure what you're searching for in those alleged lies.  Can you enlighten me? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The FBI and NSC are separate yes but the FBI shares information with the NSC.  It's the hub of information and decision-making for the executive branch in national security matters.  The NSC most likely received reports from the FBI and DNI with blacked-out American names, and then subsequently the NSA asked for the names to be unmasked, which is legal.  

I'll withhold final judgement but until I get some new knowledge on the matter, that's where I'm heavily leaning. 
 Maybe I'm missing something but I just barely even see the angle for a scandal here and I'm frankly surprised GOP senators have jumped on it with the fervor they have. </TEXT>

Do you not think it is acceptable or fair that the FBI had picked up Trump and his campaign's communications with Russian operatives in the process of surveying those Russian operatives?  Or do you not think it is acceptable that the names were unmasked to members of the NSC?

The only evidence out right now, from both crooked Nunes and from the SIC and FBI, is that the Trump campaign was incidentally caught up in legal surveillance.  If you speak to a Russian ambassador, expect your call to be tapped.  If the call has national security implications, it's perfectly legal for them to "unmask" the American's name on the other end.  When you're under investigation by the FBI's counterintelligence teams, the unmasking of your name in communications with foreign agents is legal, routine, and expected.

Unless you have proof they collected his communications directly, not incidentally, and that Susan Rice personally leaked the information to the media, you are being willfully misled. 

I know you don't want to believe Trump can do anything bad, but that shouldn't shape your understanding of reality. </TEXT>

The country will know, that's on them.

And if they'd use the nuclear option under this situation, they'd use it for the next nominee if they wanted, too.

<TEXT>  But Mr Smith appeared to speak for many of his fellow party members on the committee:

 Far too often, alarmist theories on climate science originate with scientists who operate outside the principles of the scientific method, he said in his opening statement.

 The [scientific method] avoids speculation about distant events for which there is no hard proof.

 Alarmist predictions amount to nothing more than wild guesses. 

 The ability to predict far into the future is impossible. Anyone stating they know what the climate will be in 500 years or even at the end of the century is not credible.

 All too often scientists ignore the basic tenets of science in order to justify their claims.

 Their ultimate goal is to promote a personal agenda, even if the evidence doesn't support it.

This is what it looks like to know nothing and be proud of it.

 Professor David Titley, a retired US Navy admiral, wrote in [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2017/03/28/credible-climate-scientists-need-to-boycott-biased-congressional-hearings/?utm_term=.b53526943293) ahead of the hearing: This hearing, whose witnesses consist of one mainstream climate scientist and three other witnesses whose views are very much in the minority, is remarkably similar in structure and scope to the climate hearing Senator Ted Cruz conducted in December 2015 titled Data or Dogma? So similar that two of the five witnesses from the Cruz hearing will also testify.

 In the past, the science community has participated in these hearings, even though questioning the basics of climate change is akin to holding a hearing to examine whether the Earth orbits the Sun. Enough!

This is what it looks like to know things. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The awkwardly named Best Sunshine Live hardly looks like a high-roller hub. Construction workers bet $5 or $10 at a time on roulette and baccarat in a fug of nicotine. Clustered in a far corner are a handful of tables for so-called VIP gamblers, which at 8:30 p.m. on a September Saturday are almost empty. A nearby bar has just a couple of patrons.

 Its a power list that includes a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and three former U.S. governors, including past chairmen of both the Democratic and Republican National Committees. Behind them all: a Donald Trump protege, **Mark Brown, who ran the Republican president-elects Atlantic City casino empire** and is now Imperial Pacifics chief executive officer. 

 The revenue figures, or actual wins by the house, are just a fraction of total bets. In September, Imperial Pacific reported a record $3.9 billion in bets at its casinomeaning the 100 or so high-rollers who it says come through its doors monthly each wagered an average of $39 million.

Trump and Brown fail miserably at running a legit casino in Atlantic City, so instead they get a fake casino and just launder money through it.  Brilliant! </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Senate Intelligence Committee leaders are urging the White House to turn documents related to their Russia investigation directly over to the panel, seemingly declining an invitation to examine intelligence reports at the White House. 

 A spokesperson for the Senate committee said the Trump administration should instruct the agencies who have the relevant documents to provide them directly to its members, which would cut out the White House as an intermediary. 

I don't think Burr really had a choice here.  He wouldn't want to get caught pulling a Nunes at this point.  

It's worth noting though for additional context that Burr is one of the guys who offered to ["push back"](https://www.axios.com/exclusive-spicer-arranged-sat-in-on-cia-gop-intelligence-push-back-2288082248.html) on the press when the Trump-Russia 'constant contact' stories first broke.  On the surface at least it looks like Burr is going the opposite way of Nunes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree to a point.  You don't need to stay abreast of the latest political news to be informed about how physical reality works, for example.  You can be completely disconnected from the media and still understand the concept of climate change.  Subjects which are studied primarily by scientists or even engineers are regularly distilled down into easily digestible knowledge and it's fairly simple to stay up-to-date with what's true and what's false as concerns the world around you.

Also, if people are not informed, they should realize their opinion is uninformed and has not been touched by 90% of the information that is out there.  I have no problem with people not staying up to date and not consuming information, but I do have a problem when people do so and then are offended when their opinion is criticized or are unwilling to accept new information or arguments.

 We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russias goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.  

 We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trumps election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him. All three agencies agree with this judgment. CIA and FBI have high confidence in this judgment; NSA has moderate confidence.. </TEXT>

 WATTS: I think this answer is very simple and it is what no one is really saying in this room, which is part of the reason active measures have worked in this US election, is because the commander-in-chief has used russian active measures at times against his opponents </TEXT>

 Among Republicans in the survey, 26 percent blame the bill's defeat on House Democrats, while another 23 percent say House Republicans are at fault. Only 13 percent blame Trump for the failure, and even fewer  10 percent  say it's Ryan's fault.

 The plurality of respondents that placed the blame on House Democrats fall in line with Trump's own assertion that Democrats were ultimately responsible for blocking the measure. In fact, Trump never courted Democratic votes on the measure. </TEXT>

On Thursday, however, an agency contracting official, Kevin Terry, declared that the president was not in violation because he had agreed not to receive any profits from the hotel until after he leaves office.  
  
 Mr. Terry engages in legal gymnastics that no lawyer could credibly defend. It should not matter when Mr. Trump accepts the profits from the hotel; he benefits even if he waits until after he leaves the White House to pocket them. Mr. Terry argues that as long as Mr. Trumps profits are reinvested in the hotel, rather than deposited in his bank account, there is no violation. But by reinvesting the profits, Mr. Trump is increasing the value of the hotel and its ability to earn more money in the future. He has a 60-year lease on the building, and not pocketing profits for a few years is hardly a sacrifice.  

This seems like a pretty thin and indefensible legal argument to a layman like me.

Article ends on a sobering note:
 Meanwhile, the Republican-controlled Congress is unwilling to force the president to divest or even to investigate his businesses and finances. A recently filed lawsuit, invoking the Constitution, asks a federal court to bar him from accepting profits from foreign governments. In addition, the Cork Wine Bar in Washington had sued Mr. Trump. The bars owners argue that they have lost business because Mr. Trumps hotel possesses a fundamentally illegal advantage.  
  
 Until Congress does its job, such lawsuits may be the only avenue of protest. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It is not just that Donald Trump is an egomaniac. Most presidents have a pathological need for approval and attention. Its why they suffer the slings and arrows that come with seeking the countrys top office. Egomania is for Hollywood actors and House committee chairmen who think the rule of law doesnt apply to them. Trump is a Transcendental Solipsist. It is not just that he has a strong sense of self. His view of the universe does not extend a single inch beyond the boundaries of his own interests. That is why normative concepts like truth or commonly held values or the national interest are completely alien to him. There is Trump world, and then there is oblivion.  
  
 Of course, the fact that our president is so psychologically broken would not automatically mean that the rest of us would become infected with a new, Trumpian me-me-me-ism. No, perhaps the sole notable achievement of his record-breakingly bad first couple of months in office has been his ability to make his pathology our pathology, by invoking the multiplicative principle of narcissism. If you take a nation of narcissists and place the ur-narcissist at their center of attention and he behaves in a way that makes it impossible for them to look away then all of a sudden we become like him, the world falls away, the universe evaporates, and we enter whatever is the opposite of the Buddhist ideal of enlightenment. Unlightenment? This is Transcendental Solipsism. Its all about us being all about him being all about himself.

<TEXT> Check out this article: http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/12/14240364/trump-buzzfeed-dossier-treason-law

Or a summary of the article (I'll put their closing disclaimer at the beginning for emphasis):

 To say it is premature to speculate on indictments is a vast understatement, Hennessey says. We just dont know what, if anything, has actually happened; much less what the government might be able to prove in court.
 
 Even before we know for sure what actually happened, however, we do know at least one thing: It wasnt treason. Thats a specific crime, with a specific definition, and theres no way the behavior of Trump and his aides qualifies.

Espionage Act

 The Espionage Act is commonly used to prosecute leakers, and bans the conveyance of information meant to interfere with the operation of the US armed forces or promote the success of America's enemies.
  
 While a lot depends on the specifics, the report published in BuzzFeed alleges that Donald Trump and his associates "obtained and supplied the Kremlin" with information on "leading Russian oligarchs and their families" living in the US. If that inflammatory charge proves true, one could imagine it qualifying as an Espionage Act violation.

Foreign Agents Registration Act

 [A]nother potential vulnerability comes from the Foreign Agents Registration Act; the law could come into play if the government concludes that Trump and/or his aides effectively acted as Russian agents without disclosing the connection.

The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

 [T]he Computer Fraud and Abuse Act could also form a potential basis for a prosecution against Trump aides who the report alleges knew about and collaborated with the Russian government on anti-Democratic hacking operations.

Also Logan Act but..

 Many legal observers dont take the Logan Act particularly seriously, however, given that it seems to rather clearly violate the First Amendment and would stand a good chance of being struck down should it even actually lead to a prosecution, according to Goldsmith and other legal observers like UT Austins Steve Vladeck.

<TEXT>  According to internal emails released by the agency late on Wednesday, the order went out by email minutes after 5pm on Inauguration Day, and came from Larry Gillick, whose LinkedIn profile identifies him as Acting Director of Digital Strategy at the Department of Interior.  
 
 Gillick wrote that the new administration was not jazzed by two unwise and unflattering tweets from the National Parks Service Twitter account that day. One of those was a re-tweet of New York Times journalist Binyamin Appelbaum, in which he compared the sizes of crowds assembled for inaugurations in 2009 and 2017.

<TEXT> That explanation can be used to explain anything you want therefore it's worthless.

Anyways, if the Trump campaign's communications were caught up incidentally in surveillance from a FISA legal warrant, that means he or someone in his campaign was communicating directly or indirectly with the target of an active counterintelligence operation.  Would you say that a good thing for Trump, or a bad thing for Trump? </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK, this report is a big fucking deal and is not good for Manafort.  Not good at all.  And this is on top of the other reports about Manafort's adventures that just came out yesterday. 

 President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to advance the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin a decade ago and proposed an ambitious political strategy to undermine anti-Russian opposition across former Soviet republics, The Associated Press has learned. The work appears to contradict assertions by the Trump administration and Manafort himself that he never worked for Russian interests.

 ...

 "We are now of the belief that this model can greatly benefit the Putin Government if employed at the correct levels with the appropriate commitment to success," Manafort wrote in the 2005 memo to Deripaska. The effort, Manafort wrote, "will be offering a great service that can re-focus, both internally and externally, the policies of the Putin government."

<TEXT> Allow me to help you out.  

From this blog:

 Mr. Comey made clear there has been ZERO evidence of collusion between the Russian government and the then-Trump campaign.

From the hearing:

 HIMES: So, you used the word coordination which to me suggests that you are in fact investigating whether there was coordination between U.S. persons and the Russians. Is it fair for me to assume that we shouldn't simply dismiss the possibility that there was coordination or collusion between the Russian efforts and U.S. persons as an investigatory body?
  
 COMEY: Well all I can tell you is what **we're investigating which includes whether there was any coordination between people associated with the Trump campaign and the Russians**.

And earlier:

 STEWART: ... Mr. Clapper, the former DNI, and we all know who he is, this is someone who should know. I want to read what he said just a few weeks ago. Mr. Clapper then went on to say that to his knowledge there was no evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. We did not conclude any evidence in our report and when I say "our report," that is the NSA, FBI, and CIA with my office, the director of national intelligence said anything -- any reflection of collusion between the members of Trump campaign and the Russians, there was no evidence of that in our report.

 Was Mr. Clapper wrong when he said that?

 COMEY: I think he's right **about characterizing the report** which you all have read. </TEXT>

If you're still wondering...

 SCHIFF: Now, the British allies -- our British allies have called the president's suggestion that they wiretapped him for Obama nonsense and utterly ridiculous. Would you agree?

 ROGERS: Yes, sir. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not making any claims here, but I get your point completely.  I just thought it was an interesting decision by the DOJ (even outside of Trump) and in the process got to discover how disclosure of declinations of indictments works - which is more ambiguous process than I would have thought. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Main points below, article has further background info but not much.  Is it normal to discover a major investigation is closed in this manner and this late?  I should probably look it up.  

EDIT: Looks like whether or not to even notify [targets of prosecution](http://www.instituteforlegalreform.com/uploads/sites/1/DeclinationsBooklet.pdf) that they are no longer being investigated is discretionary, and the [US Attorney manual] (https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-2000-authority-us-attorney-criminal-division-mattersprior-approvals#9-2.050) doesn't say much about publicly disclosing, just filing a written notice in 'cases of considerable public interest'


 Deutsche Bank, the Trump Organization's largest creditor, said Monday that the Justice Department recently closed a criminal investigation into possible currency manipulation.  
  
 President Donald Trump's Attorney General Jeff Sessions took office on Feb. 9.  
  
**The Justice Department notified the German bank in a letter Feb. 13 that it was closing the investigation, Deutsche Bank said Monday in a public filing.**
 
 In October, near the end of the Obama administration, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission dropped its own investigation into Deutsche Bank and currency manipulation.
 
 Deutsche Bank has drawn special scrutiny in recent months because of its ties to Trump, which include billions of dollars of loans since the 1990s. Many of the loans have been paid off but four remain unpaid -- on properties in Miami, Chicago and Washington, D.C.  
  
 The four loans were worth a total of $364 million when they were made, between 2012 and 2015, and are now worth roughly $300 million, according to an estimate by Bloomberg.  
  
 The Justice Department would not comment on its decision to close the investigation. Deutsche Bank did not return an email seeking comment.

 ...  
  
 In the Justice Department's currency-manipulation investigation, five major banks pleaded guilty in 2015 and paid a total of $2.5 billion in criminal penalties to settle charges that they manipulated the prices of dollars and euros in the foreign-currency exchange. The banks included Citigroup, JPMorgan and Bank of America.  
  
  Deutsche Bank said in its filing Monday that other "regulatory and law-enforcement agencies" around the world are probing currency trading and that is it "cooperating with these investigations." The bank did not specify which agencies are investigating but said the probes could result in "significant financial penalties." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Article points out a meaningful question to watch (second paragraph of this quote):

 When was the last time that the U.S. economy was as healthy as it is today and Washington began to talk about a stimulus cocktail of tax cuts and deregulation and government spending? said Richard Bernstein, founder of an eponymous investment advisory firm in New York with $4-billion (U.S.) under management. The answer to that question is never.  

  

 Mr. Bernstein said that he recently spoke with one of Mr. Trumps advisers about the administrations pro-growth rhetoric. He wanted to know whether the goal was to spur nominal economic growth  which includes inflation  or real growth, which excludes it. He didnt get a response. I think thats the question every investor should be asking, said Mr. Bernstein. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The relevance is it was an answer to your question, "How is it different?".  The motivations to have a President serve your interests have to be much stronger than what a single senator could generate, so the amount of risk and resources another nation-state would be willing to commit would go up proportionately, no?

 Nah, Israel is a client dependent on us for financial, military, and diplomatic support. Their bigoted policies are at odds with our values.

 We share the greatest common interest with Russia: avoiding nuclear war and mutually assured destruction.

You're cherry picking and using it to motivate your reasoning.  I agree with the underlying sentiment about Israel in terms of specific policies and rhetoric from those in power recently and now.  But looking at it holistically and in defensive and existential terms, Israel has a major stake in keeping it's ally NATO formidable and the EU in tact.  Russia has the opposite interests. 

Of course both the U.S. and Russia share an interest in not wiping each other off the map.  So do we and Israel.  That's not a meaningful common interest in the sense I'm talking about.

 Every culture shares our racism, misogyny and xenophobia. They're common human values. It's our ignorance and hubris that invite the most mockery and ridicule.

Again, you're cherry picking and using it to motivate your reasoning.  Of course I agree demonstrations of the U.S.'s hubris and ignorance are not hard to find, but America as an abstract idea, or a meme in the scientific sense if you will, has a set of a values and ideas it is composed of that are incorruptible by those currently in power.  Trump could light this country on fire and people would still be able to remember what America once was or once stood for because it as a self-contained idea has a life of it's own, as do all ideas. In this sense, Trump is deeply at odds with the idea of America, and this is what I was getting at.  

 He's turning up the heat as he should. Everybody lies in the campaign. They're politicians. Insinuating treason and election rigging? That's another level.

He should not turn up the heat actually because it is to the country's detriment, and arguably his.  Trump is not a liar like everybody, he lies at a substantially higher rate than any other previous politician.  Whether or not his lying is pathological, the results are the same.  The consistency of his rate of lying and the sheer absurdity of many of his lies have also not been seen before in a President.  It's plain and demonstrable that this is true and the upshot will be that Trump will not make evidence-based decisions.

 I'm not interested in insinuations and "consensus opinions" of the "intelligence community." That's for chumps like the fools who voted for Trump. Show me evidence. Do you have anything on Trump? I haven't seen shit despite all the hysteria.

I can work up a list of all the coincidences, or circumstantial evidence, that needs to be explained away for this all to be nothing, but I completely forgot that one much more obsessive redditor already has a live document going: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DnQWKe9koRkG31bO3vGJdLjqlI5fPi4I7MRjWFTz3Y0/edit#  It's just an accounting of primary sources reporting on the coincidences, it's not a document purporting a theory.  Read the intro.  Or if you'd rather me come up with the list or if that list isn't what I said it is, let me know.

 Aw shucks, we better get those honest characters on the hill to do more good work! /s
Politics is most certainly a game for those who play. It's got nothing to do with honesty. The ends justify the means. Every fucking time. It's shameful and disgusting business.

I anticipated a reaction to the word honest but I used it anyways.  I don't suspect the media colludes on a local, state, national, and international level to report the same fixed story, narrative, or sets of facts or non-facts.  The logistics of it and the secrecy required for hundreds of thousands of individual humans to willfully mislead the public makes it an untenable irrational conspiracy theory, especially without evidence.

 Politics is most certainly a game for those who play. It's got nothing to do with honesty. The ends justify the means. Every fucking time. It's shameful and disgusting business.

Politics can be considered a game yeah but I was again talking more in existential terms.  I don't think it's disputable that it's a bad thing to collude with a foreign adversary to undermine the election process or advance their interests against one's own country.

 I'm with Jedi Mind Tricks in Trail of Lies about the difference in flavor: "conservatism, liberalism they divide the line." They're almost all lying SOBs. They'll do their "duty" to those who have them by the short hairs. The rest of us get nothing and like it. Have you even been paying attention? You get two choices (D) you lose or (R) you get fucked. Pick you poison.

You're conflating liberals to the Democratic party and conservatives to the Republican party.  There is a big difference between classical liberalism and traditional conservatism.  And as for the frustration with the binary choice between (D) and (R) and equating the two, I used to think this as well but that's not so obvious anymore because it's fairly clear that the two parties seek very different policies.

 That was fun.

I'm ambivalent about whether or not you're replying entirely in good faith seeking a constructive dialogue, but you've certainly committed a lot of your time and it has been decent fun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I shouldn't have to spell out for you how it's different, but it varies wildly in two key areas: 

**The power of a President vs the power of a Senator**

Who has more power, a single senator, or the President?  Who has more influence, a single senator, or the President?  Who has a better chance of influencing foreign policy, a single senator, or the President?  Who does the international community listen to the most, a single senator, or the President?  Who has a better chance of lifting sanctions and warming relations, a single senator, or the President?  Who controls the military, a single senator, or the President?

**The difference between Israel and Russia**  

Israel is a long-time ally who shares the vast majority of our interests.
Russia is a long-time adversary who does not share the vast majority of our interests, and in fact has interests in direct conflict with ours.  Moreover, it is conclusive, according to the IC, that Russia did indeed hack and disseminate documents from private American citizens and institutions specifically to influence opinion in favor of Trump.  Meanwhile, Trump has not *one single time* criticized Putin or Russia.  Not once.  And the list of contacts between his campaign and Russian officials is not short and includes contacts that were not disclosed and were actually lied about. Do I need to do the work for you to show you the evidence which **suggests** a suspicion of Trump/Russia collusion is reasonable?  Because I gladly will.

Plainly, the benefits of co-opting a President grossly outweigh the benefits of co-opting a Senator, it's self-evident.  For someone so keen on using the term 'rudimentary', I would think this is something you would have determined yourself, as it's rudimentary.

But now I have to address the rest of the things you said.

 The hysterical reporting about Russia and the insinuations of collusion by Trump and his campaign are mendacious if there's not evidence to sustain the charge. **These claims have weakened a sitting President and the nation and made us an international laughingstock.** They should have never been publicly voiced without compelling evidence.

I don't mean to offend but it's clear here you are betraying your lack of awareness of the opinion of the international community.  To cultures that share our values, the US is a laughingstock because we elected Trump, period.  The rest is damage mitigation as a result of that disastrous decision by the populace.

 Since they have it's not surprising that Trump is hitting back at Obama with wiretapping claims. The precedent for fact free insinuation has been set. 

This is a patently false statement.  Trump began his campaign with fact-free claims and insinuations and has continued them to this day.  To suggest Trump is now putting out false statements only because the media is reporting about the Russian investigation is simply absurd.

 What concerns me the most is what these attacks will inspire Trump to do in response. He's nothing if not vindictive and his quip about Merkel demonstrates how much ammo there is to use against the Democrats. Just imagine what top secret information leaks could do to damage their legacy and prospects.

Here I agree with you.  But the investigation and honest reports about it should not be put aside in fear of Trump's reaction.  This isn't a game.  Again, **if** Trump colluded with the Russians, the consequences of ignoring it are FAR greater than the consequences for pursuing it and being proven wrong.  That is also self-evident.

 Politics is dirty pool - shameful and disgusting stuff. Trump's a natural and I expect that will help him to keep winning. Especially against feckless cowards like the Democrats on the Hill.

This is just opinion of which I will grant you is fine but only if you also consider Republicans similarly.  It's clear they are not doing their duty to check Trump.

<TEXT> The circumstances of any contact between Schumer and Israel are radically different than the circumstances of someone's ascent into the highest position of power in the government while simultaneously receiving support (incidental OR purposeful) from the Russian government.  And is there evidence of Schumer and his aides meeting with Israeli officials and then lying about it both under oath and not?  

Either way, I think we are finally converging because yes I agree absent evidence no one should be branded a traitor.  But it's not a switch that flips.  The evidence has built up and suspicions of him based on what we know publicly so far are *reasonable*, which was essentially my entire original point.  The only nuance you added is that it would be unreasonable to declare him a traitor based on what we know publicly so far, which I was never disputing in the first place.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes we are entitled to a presumption of innocence and yes I believe in it.  But you need to add on top of that all of the evidence of the serial connections between Russia and Trump, where their interests aligned like policies on Ukraine, positions on EU, on Brexit, and the hack of the DNC, as well as the repetitive on-the-record lies from multiple Trump aides about who met who and who didn't.  There's a lot.  Therefore, the presumption gets eroded.  It's really not that hard to understand, and the binary choice you presented is not fair nor fully rational.

Is anyone suggesting he colluded with, I don't know,  Iran?  Hungary?  Turkey?  No... it's just Russia and for multiple compounding and connected reasons which has been developing for several months.

This is what I am not understanding about your complete dismissal of any concern of Trump's ties to Russia.

<TEXT> Are you actually trying to have a rational conversation?  Where did I say I agree Trump didn't collude with Russia?  If you read what I wrote and came away with that, you didn't read what I wrote.

Once again, a former acting director of 8 months who does not have access to all of the information cannot declare there is nothing to see here and expect to be believed or be used as some sort of final arbiter on the matter.

And every loose connection you listed does not have the long string of remarkable and suspicious coincidences that the Trump and Russia connection has.  The coincidences that need to be explained away total in the double digits.  If you can't see that, you're plainly not looking.  There's an enormous difference between thinking Ellison is a stooge for Saudi Arabia because he's Muslim when there's zero evidence of that and being suspicious of Trump because he has several aides meeting with Russian officials and not disclosing it, has aides meeting with Assange and apparently the "hacker" Guccifer 2.0, has been 100% consistent in praise for Russia and Putin, had policies on Ukraine changed in the RNC platform that conveniently help Russia, had his communications swept up in surveillance of Russian agents, etc.

This one is particularly awful:

 Department of Homeland Security  
Proposed budget: $44.1 billion  
Total boosts: $2.8 billion  

 The DHS is one of the few executive offices that Trump thinks deserves a raise. And thats not because it encompasses FEMA, the federal backstop that saves (or at least, tries  sometimes) people from losing everything after natural disasters. No, most of the budget surplus goes to, you guessed it, border security and immigration. Unfortunately for the millions of Americans who live in flood prone regions, Trumps budget calls for cutting $190 million from the National Flood Insurance Program, another program that enjoys fairly broad bipartisan support. </TEXT>

 The newly released documents show that Flynn was also paid $11,250 that year by the U.S. subsidiary of a Russian cybersecurity firm, Kaspersky Lab, and another $11,250 by the Russian charter cargo airline Volga-Dnepr Airlines. The cyberfirm said the payment came for a speech Flynn delivered in Washington.    
  ...  
 This month, Flynn filed paperwork indicating that he had been a foreign agent during the months when he was a top adviser to Trumps campaign. Flynns company was hired by a Dutch company owned by a Turkish businessman to do work related to Turkish government interests.  
 ...  
 The newly disclosed documents were released by Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who is the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. He included the additional payments to Flynn in a letter to Trump, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and FBI Director James B. Comey, questioning whether Flynns fees violated prohibitions on retired military officers accepting payments or gifts from foreign governments.    
  ...  
  The emails show that in addition to paying for Flynns speaking fee, RT paid for business class travel and accommodations at the luxury Metropol hotel while covering expenses for Flynns son, Michael G. Flynn, who served as a chief of staff. After the logistics were nailed down, a staffer for Flynns speakers bureau wrote to an RT staffer, Im so happy we were able to work everything out and get you exactly what you wanted!  
 ...  
 In interviews, Flynn has dismissed concerns about the news networks Kremlin ties, comparing the network to independent U.S. outlets. Whats CNN? Whats MSNBC? Come on! said Flynn.  
 ...  
 According to Cummingss letter, the airline, Volga-Dnepr, was removed from a list of approved United Nations vendors in 2007 following corruption allegations against two Russian officials who steered contracts to the firm.

Tillerson: State Department funding 'simply not sustainable'
 Getty
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Thursday defended the President Trump's proposal to cut funding to the State Department.
  
 When speaking in Tokyo, Tillerson said the cuts to the department are important to fix the "historically high" budget, Reuters reported.
  
 "Clearly the level of spending that the State Department has been undertaking, particularly in this past year, is simply not sustainable," he said.

Thanks again Rubio and McCain for voting this rubber stamp through.  Tillerson must have channeled his best Wayne Tracker during the confirmation hearing because he completely duped them. </TEXT>

It's hard to tell from this whether or not he's even aware there is a public hearing on Monday in the House Intelligence Committee.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) offered the resolution Wednesday that instructs the House to request Trump's tax returns from 2006 to 2015, so the Ways and Means Committee can examine them in a closed session.  
 ...  

 As was the case in past weeks, Crowley tried to offer the resolution as "privileged," meaning the House would have to act on it within two legislative days. But Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), who was presiding over the House, ruled that the measure was not privileged, and the vast majority of Republicans voted to table Crowley's appeal of that ruling, 223-183.

 Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) voted "present," and Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.) voted with the Democrats, as they did on a similar vote last week. Knight voted with the bulk of the Republicans.

 This is the third week in a row that Democrats have offered a resolution on the House floor pertaining to Trump's tax returns. While none of those measures have passed so far, Democrats want to keep the pressure on Trump. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's not wrong in that Rand Paul did vote in Russia's interest here, whether or not Paul thought there were also other compelling interests.

 Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., on Wednesday accused Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., of working for Vladimir Putin after Paul blocked consideration of a treaty that would allow Montenegro into the United Nations.

 The only conclusion you can draw when he walks away is he has no argument to be made, he said.

 The senator from Kentucky is now working for Vladimir Putin, McCain concluded.

Funny that McCain sees Russia's interests in Rand Paul's vote but can't seem to bring himself to see Russia's interests in Trump's entire presidency.  Or maybe he does, but he's not letting his colleagues know publicly to this same degree. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The manner in which the deployments  the first known of conventional forces to Syria  was undertaken marked a stark contrast to the Obama administration. Then, Army Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the commander of the war against ISIS, had to get sign off from the White House about the precise number of troops and weapons he wanted to use. With the current deployment, the Trump administration has just left it to him to determine what he needs in Syria. That is, it appears the administration signed off on the ground combat missions but so far has left the details of how to carry out that mission  including those details the Obama White House demanded  to the commander.  

 The change has yet to be stated officially, and some inside the chain of command are unsure if this reflects a new approach or a new administration that has yet to iron out its process and staffing. President Donald Trump has shown great deference to those in uniform, from Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general, on down.  

 Its unclear where exactly each authority lies at this point in the new administration, one defense official told BuzzFeed News.

 ...

 While some in the Pentagon saw the new deployments as a commander-in-chief trusting his generals, others are quietly uncomfortable with the US military entering another country, uninvited. The administration has not sought a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force, known as an AUMF, in its war against ISIS, and includes nearly all deployments under the AUMF issued in 2001 in the wake of 9/11. Moreover, it is unclear what a defeat of ISIS, both a self-proclaimed state and also an insurgency, would look like.  

 Ill be honest. It makes me nervous, a second defense official said. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The decision from U.S. District Judge James L. Robart is a modest blow to the state of Washington, which had sued over the ban, because the quickest path to success would have been getting the judge to declare that Trumps new order was affected by the freeze he imposed previously. But Robart declined to do that only for procedural reasons and did not address the merits of any arguments.

 Neither side, he wrote, had filed a motion for him to consider, and the states previous complaints were directed at an executive order which is now revoked.

 Accordingly, the court also declines to resolve the apparent dispute between the parties concerning the applicability of the courts injunctive order to the New Executive Order until such time as an amended complaint that addresses the New Executive Order is properly before the court, Robart wrote.

Probably the correct decision as it's on procedural grounds.  Temporary setback. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Apparently he paid $50 million more than it was worth, and $13 million more than the previous most expensive home in Palm Beach.

 In 2008, Rybolovlev characterized the purchase as a company investment: This acquisition is simply an investment in real estate by one of the companies in which I have an interest, Rybolovlev said at the time through a spokesman for Uralkali, the fertilizer company he previously owned.

 Rybolovlev added that he didnt plan to live in the United States.

 Nonetheless, he went ahead and paid an exceptionally high, $50 million premium to Trump, then a real estate tycoon and reality TV host, for a property he never sought to live in, not even on a part-time basis.

 ...

 In 2011, court documents in his divorce stated that Mr. Rybolovlev has not purchased or managed any real estate in Florida for investment purposes, either directly or indirectly, according to a motion filed in the divorce case.

 That was news to Trump.

 Somebody paid me $100 million, Trump told a Palm Beach Post reporter in February 2011.

 Trump made a hefty profit on the flip: He had scooped up the estate for $41.35 million in 2004 out of health-care magnate Abe Gosmans bankruptcy filing. In essence, Trump sold for more than double what he had paid four years before. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Oh I totally agree. I guess my point is the mocking is real, and as you said rightfully so, so they aren't wrong to feel discriminated towards (although I'm not agreeing it's more than muslims).

Wow, that totally went over my head initially.  I didn't think about it from that angle, although I still think they are being willfully ignorant.  But, I actually take that point and understand more then how they'd feel that way, yet still that degree of discrimination is wholly different than Muslims whom get their mosques banned from being built by clever zoning maneuvers in some towns (like in Bernards Township, NJ), mosques burnt down, get discriminated against in the job market, denounced by the President and his advisers, get banned from entry into the US if they were born in one of 6 countries, receive distrusting and hostile looks just walking down the street, and get consistently harassed by the TSA despite them catching 0 terrorists.  People, usually Christians, talk about Muslims sometimes like they are some sort of disease or cancer on our culture, not realizing if the 3.3 million Muslims which lived in this country were actually just that, things would be a little different.  And also not realizing that some of their closely held beliefs stemming from their interpretations of Christianity can lead to just as costly and harmful social policies as some aspects of what you may see in Sharia law.  If we were governed by the code of Deuteronomy, well, my word.

 But I might be naive, as I also feel republicans should be the most vocal in denouncing trump and standing up for their "religion" and what they want it to represent. Perhaps this is me still wanting to believe in the good in everyone :(

That's a good quality to have actually, and I think it's justified to think Republicans, based on what they proclaim they believe in, would have denounced Trump's rise and rhetoric consistently and forcefully. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just don't understand how you think one legal case defining one segment of the EOP as 'not an agency' means it automatically applies to parallel segments in the EOP.  It doesn't seem like it has any bearing.  You've convinced me there's more legal substance to your argument than I initially though so thanks for continuing to engage me to figure this out, but I still think it's incorrect.  But it's muddled legal territory, because every reference to EOP I find lists its agencies, including on the federal register and academic journals.  It cannot be considered an an absolute parochial usage of the word when it's in the federal register, no?  I mean, it's not coming from some blog.  Maybe the academic journals and encyclopedia can be discounted, but the federal register?  

Also, what about Nixon defining the Counselor to the President as a cabinet-level position?  Do you think that has any bearing on this?

I need to find the statute defining the EOP, that would probably help.

EDIT: I see your edit about my second question about the cabinet-level.  Thanks.  I need to find the defining statute. Shaub has read the legal guidance you cited from Jan 20 and he disagrees.  He has to have a good reason for doing so and I think it's because this reliance on the word agency is weak and can be overtaken.  Unfortunately I do not have the full justification at the moment as you have certainly thrown a (welcome) wrench into all of this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Using your legal argument, the other departments under EOP are not covered by ethics laws or Title VII either, including....

* Council of Economic Advisers
* Council on Environmental Quality
* National Security Council
* Office of Administration
* Office of Management and Budget
* Office of National Drug Control Policy
* Office of Science and Technology Policy
* Office of the United States Trade Representative
* Office of the Vice President

You think the ethics laws don't apply to these?

One segment of a hierarchical department can be considered 'not an agency' for legal purposes while other segments of it can, I would presume.  See this: http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/federal-agencies

 President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the EOP in 1939 to manage a dramatic expansion in the size and responsibility of the executive branch. The **EOP established agencies** to perform highly specialized services for the president. Each president has altered the composition of the EOP to some extent. **Some standard agencies**  within the EOP include the White House Office, Office of the Vice President, Council of Economic Advisors (CEA), Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), National Security Council, Office of Administration, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Office of National Drug Control Policy, Office of Policy Development, Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

Or: http://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/Sourcebook12.pdf

 The EOP is best understood as a warehouse that contains many distinct agencies and offices rather than as an agency in its own right.  ....
 Among federal agencies, **EOP agencies** are usually the most responsive to the President....

Moreover, Kellyanne works as the Counselor to the President, which is a cabinet-level position, all of which are covered by ethics laws. </TEXT>

I'm aware.

Since you bypassed my argument to try to teach what a colloquial definition is, I'll restate my position again.  The case you presented defined the Executive Residence of the White House as 'not an agency'.  It did not define the Executive Office of the President as 'not an agency'.  You keep saying the 'White House', which is a broad term and narrowly defined in that case as the Executive Residence. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  But Bannons transition to a more professional role has reportedly been accompanied by a shift to pragmatism that has unnerved the loyal coalition of white nationalists who are the backbone of Breitbart and who helped elect Trump. On two of the foundational hardline platforms of Trumps campaign, immigration and health care, Bannon has reportedly become a moderating force in the White House.

 [Buzzfeed News](https://www.buzzfeed.com/adriancarrasquillo/steve-bannon-helped-preserve-daca-but-democrats-and-activist?utm_term=.mu0EYg9n1#.jeLmzOeYK) reported that two administration sources pointed to chief strategist Steve Bannon as the man who preserved the current iteration of DACA, the executive action signed by former President Barack Obama to defer the deportation of undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. Bannon reportedly battled against other administration officials, like Attorney General Jeff Sessions and senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, to slow down Trumps promise to end the program on his first day in office (a stark difference when compared to Breitbarts anti-immigrant coverage).

WTF?  

 Bannons effort to save the measure backed by members of both parties is less of a turn towards moderation and more of a strategic ploy to engender goodwill for future immigration battles, Buzzfeed reported.

Ah, he's a patient extremist. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Ethics experts have told NPR that the White House's argument that "many" ethics rules don't apply to EOP employees may rest on the definition of the word "agency."

 A number of ethics rules state that they apply to employees of government "agencies," so this definition is a crucial one in determining which rules apply to whom. Indeed, Passantino had said in a footnote that the White House Office, a subsection of the Executive Office of the President, is not an "agency."

 Shaub disagreed with that as well.

 Painter told NPR last week that hinging the argument on the word "agency" could be a losing fight. "I am not sure this argument is right so I never would have tried it and would not recommend that the White House do so," he said.

 Likewise, Obama administration ethics official Norman Eisen said he believes the Trump White House's approach here is wrongheaded.

 "This is nonsense. There are debates about whether for other purposes the [White House] is an agency," Norman Eisen wrote in an email to NPR. "Never before for ethics purposes."

<TEXT>  When Rohrabacher asked Ilves to provide examples of Russian military aggression, the former president referred to the border incident. Rohrabacher was unimpressed: "So you had a situation of corruption at the border, one of your border guards disappeared. I mean military aggression? Has there been any cross-border, at all, military action on the part of the Russians in Estonia?"

 "Well, we have constant violations of our border by military jets, that's one thing, and that's consistent," Ilves said, adding these incidents have "massively increased in the last four years."

 Rohrabacher explained that he had visited the Baltic States after hearing stories of Russian military aggression and found "not one report of actual military aggression." He added that the US has sent "our tanks up there, having B-52 mock raids on Russia, over Estonia, toward the Soviet capital, in the name of stopping Soviet military aggression that never existed. This has got to stop or we're going to end up in war."

Members of the GOP have an extraordinary ability to dismiss any piece of information related to Russia not being so friendly to us or our allies (or Trump's ties).  I wonder if this guy wants Trump's Obama claims investigated?  And why is he calling them Soviets?

 Rohrabacher also compared Putin to Richard Daley, the late mayor of Chicago, saying that Russia is "being run by tough guyssort of like Mayor Daley, in Chicago, is transported over to Russia."

 Connolly then addressed Rohbacher's comparison of Putin with Daley. "I went to school in Chicago during his mayorality," Connolly said. "I didn't know him, but I assure you, Vladimir Putin is no Richard Daley. Richard Daley did not have his political opponents assassinated. He didn't send them into exile. He didn't put them in prison. He didn't silence the press. He didn't assassinate members of the press. He didn't exile members of the press. He sparred with them, and sometimes he was bestedThere is no comparison, and I think we do ourselves a disservice by not recognizing on a bipartisan basis the gravity of the situation we face."

I'm still not sure why Putin apologists cannot understand this, instead conflating actions the CIA or our military may have taken in the past in other countries with Putin's consistent degradation of human rights domestically over the past 17 years of his rule. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Page is at it again.

 A former foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump has written to congressional investigators claiming, without evidence, that his mobile phone may have been tapped last year.

 Carter Page, a businessman, suggests this would support the view that the Trump campaign headquarters at Trump Tower in New York was under surveillance, since he works nearby and was a frequent visitor there.

 In a letter addressed to Richard Burr and Mark Warner, chairman and vice-chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, Page notes media reports that secret court orders were issued last October to allow the FBI to conduct surveillance of US persons in an investigation of possible contacts between Russian banks and the Trump Organization.

 Having spoken in favor of some of Mr Trumps policies on other Fox News Group programs during the 2016 campaign as a campaign surrogate and given the peaceful relationship I have had with Russian citizens since my years in the US Navy, it may be understandable why I would be an associated political target if such sick activities had indeed been committed as alleged in the previously cited media reports, he writes.

 For your information, I have frequently dined in Trump Grill, had lunch in Trump Caf, had coffee meetings in the Starbucks at Trump Tower, attended events and spent many hours in campaign headquarters on the fifth floor last year. As a sister skyscraper in Manhattan, my office at the IBM Building (590 Madison Avenue) is literally connected to the Trump Tower building by an atrium.

 Page continues: So if prior media reports may be believed that surveillance was indeed undertaken against me and other Trump supporters, **it should be essentially deemed as a proven fact** that the American peoples concerns **that Trump Tower was under surveillance last year is entirely correct.** </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Obama thinks the president's claims, presented without evidence, "undermine the integrity of the office," a source close to him told NBC News.

 But the source said Obama "is much more concerned by President Trump kicking people off health insurance, **not staffing the government**, not being prepared for a crisis, rolling back regulations so that corporations can pollute the air and water and letting mentally unstable people buy guns with no problems whatsoever."

 "He cares about all those things much more than what President Trump tweets at the TV each morning," the source told NBC News.

Obama's got his eye on the ball. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a really good article.  I especially like this part describing the Republican's political MO:
 In a very accessible column, Jared Meyer of Economics21 lays out two ways the spending side of the Affordable Care Act hurts growth. One is that by giving low-income families generous subsidies that phase out as their incomes rise, it reduces their incentive to work more hours or find higher-paying jobs. The other is that the ACA makes it easier for workers in their late 50s or early 60s to retire early, by ensuring they dont need to maintain a full-time job to maintain their health insurance.  
 ...  

 When the Congressional Budget Office came out with the report that provided the basis for Meyers assertion about early retirement, practical Republican Party politicians were overjoyed.

 Just yesterday, said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the Congressional Budget Office found that Obamacare will cost millions of Americans their jobs.

 Georgia Rep. Phil Gingrey said the law creates unprecedented uncertainty for job creators that, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, will leave millions of people looking for work in the next few years.

 Minnesota Rep. John Kline was even blunter: The president's health care law is destroying full-time jobs.

 This is not what the CBO said, as fact-check columns from the Washington Post, PolitiFact, and elsewhere pointed out. But that didnt stop incumbent Republicans from saying it. Nor did it stop Republican challengers like North Carolinas Thom Tillis from saying it in their ads. Running against Kay Hagan in 2014, Tillis charged that the health care law Hagan had voted for would cause 2 million Americans to lose their jobs, according to the CBO.

 That wasnt true, fact-checkers said it wasnt true, but it was a good ad anyway, and Tillis narrowly defeated Hagan.

 The striking thing about Republican use of the CBO report on the Affordable Care Acts labor supply impact is that Republicans werent exaggerating. They werent just making things up, either.

 They were taking a completely genuine conservative policy critique of the law  that it was making things a little too cushy for people, so they might decide to quit working  and turned it into roughly the opposite argument, that the Obamacare jackboot was going to prevent people who wanted jobs from finding work. The habit of doing this repeatedly  not just saying things that arent true, but refusing to state Republicans actual objections to the law  is what has painted the Republican Party into a corner.

And that closing...

 Its a question of whether Republicans should try to deliver on their ideas or try to deliver on their promises, in a world where their ideas are antithetical to what theyve promised. And theres no way out. </TEXT>

I'm agreeing with you, hypothetically anyway (the US intel community said there is no conclusive evidence russia was behind the hack, but I know you've been reading a steady diet of reddit outrage porn about Russia and don't want to give you an aneurysm right now by going against the narative.)

Buddy, this shows me all I need to know about you.  This discussion here only exists to serve your interests and ego.  You have no interest in having a conversation that goes anywhere, you lack any ability to have a dispassionate and objective discussion, and you don't know jack shit about me, how old I am, how much I read or what I read.

 Lol, ok, deep breaths. I'm agreeing with you, hypothetically anyway (the US intel community said there is no conclusive evidence russia was behind the hack, but I know you've been reading a steady diet of reddit outrage porn about Russia and don't want to give you an aneurysm right now by going against the narative.)

Compared to Trump, I would accept Hillary including your slightly delusional description of her.  I would accept a random person out of the phone book.  There's no cognitive dissonance when there's two options, and one is better than the other.

 You may very well have not been old enough to actually vote, so its cool m8. I would try to get your info from a more diverse source than just the reddit comment section.

Again, you know nothing.  You can reply to this and disparage me with your fantasy description of me all you'd like if you want to, though, if it makes you feel better.

EDIT: Just to help you out, here's the actual assessment from our intelligence agencies that I read, which is where I got the main source of my information on the hack on the election.  Read it for yourself, and it's dated **two weeks** after your article.  Jesus, man.

 [We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US
presidential election. Russias goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process,
denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess
Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We
have high confidence in these judgments.](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3254237/Russia-Hack-Report.pdf)  

 [We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trumps
election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her
unfavorably to him. All three agencies agree with this judgment. CIA and FBI have high confidence
in this judgment; NSA has moderate confidence.](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3254237/Russia-Hack-Report.pdf) </TEXT>

<TEXT> So you're telling me you can re-read what you just wrote, and it makes complete sense to you?  No amount of criticism or rational argument can dislodge the notion from your mind that Hillary would be a worse President than Trump?  No amount of reasoning and perhaps missing knowledge could convince you that the election actually *was* influenced from without to favor one candidate?  And if using the phrase "to hack the election" is doublespeak when it concerns actual external influence on our election process, then how do you describe the communication coming from the White House?

Oh and good job, saying "if you're old enough to vote" betrays your motivations in how you are approaching this dialogue, by the way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yikes man.  That's an impressive devotion to semantics you have there to define your worldview.  If you think a foreign power hacking one party and dumping it out to help the other is cool, is nothing to worry about, that's on you, not me.  If you think the phrase "hacking the election" is not the appropriate phrase to define what happened, fine, but nevertheless, a foreign power did exert influence on the election, and hacking is often used in the sense "to modify" or "a creative solution to a problem or limitation".  But go on, feel good about yourself by saying I'm using "doublespeak" as if I'm part of the problem even though I'm rationally laying out a clear explanation of everything I'm saying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Troubled waters these days is right.  And likewise.

For #1, no dispute from me there, I don't know one way or another. 

For #2, I agree up to a point.  That thought also ran through my head.  But it's difficult for me to extrapolate how I remember meeting people to how a candidate for President would remember meeting people (especially foreign dignitaries) because every move of theirs is scrutinized and watched and they are just meeting different types of people than a layman.

For #3, that's a reasonable fear, but I don't think an investigation would hurt more than it would help in that regard.  But more to the overall point, I think the issue is again just the simple dissonance between Trump saying he's never met a Russian official during the campaign, and this report.  Like you I'm not convinced this meeting was nefarious nor that Trump even remembers this, but the dissonance is still there nonetheless.  And dissonance needs to resolve in one way or another.

As for your last candid statement, I can empathize, but for myself I can only say that I wish it was much ado about nothing.  Perhaps it is.  But having a foreign power (especially one adversarial to us) inject themselves surreptitiously into the political debate going on in the country during the election, and now possibly being intertwined in our government at the highest levels, really disturbs me.  And this is completely separate from how Trump himself or his policies may or may not disturb me, mind you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I take your point of view on that, I think the issue is that Trump has never disclosed this when asked if he has had any contacts with Russian officials during the campaign, and we're only learning about it through reporting.

Also, it was a invite-only meeting, and they did shake hands, so it wasn't just that they were in the same room together.  Not to mention JD Gordon has said explicitly he talked with the ambassador about relaxing relations during the campaign, so it's not some crazy stretch to think something similar could have happened here.  Either way, I get your point, and this may indeed be as innocent as you represented it.  

But I don't think it should just be explained away by anyone other than Trump, really, and I wish Trump supporters would welcome an investigation to clear this all up. </TEXT>

 A few minutes before he made those remarks, Mr. Trump met at a VIP reception with Russias ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Ivanovich Kislyak. Mr. Trump warmly greeted Mr. Kislyak and **three other foreign ambassadors** who came to the reception.

The key thing i think you're missing is Trump has claimed he never met or had contact with a single Russian during the campaign, but then there's this report that says otherwise.  Sure, it may be completely innocent, but he denied something that happened.  Why?  This is the what, fourth or fifth time someone said they didn't meet any Russians but have? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, there's multiple questions there.  I agree the key issue to press is why he did not disclose this, and I'm sure if we look through the record he has categorically denied meeting any Russian officials.

But what is wrong with warming up with Russia?  Nothing in isolation, but when Russia is responsible for invading two sovereign nations in the past 10 years and annexing their territory, undermining democracy in Eastern Europe for a decade or more (and now pretty much all of Europe), intervening in Syria to change the tide for the Assad regime and it's accompanying war crimes as documented by the UN and at least a half dozen NGOs, it's culpability in the downing of the MH17 flight, and most importantly, it's interference in the domestic political affairs of this country by committing what has to be the largest cyberattack in our history, warming up to a Russia without *any* recourse from them is a major problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Crucial parts FTA:

 Trump personally met with the Russian ambassador on April 27, 2016, prior to a major foreign policy speech. The Wall Street Journal, in a report that was [little-noticed](http://americablog.com/2017/03/newsmax-trump-met-russian-amb-kislyak-last-april-despite-denials.html) at the time but was recently picked up by AMERICABlog News, [reported the meeting last year](https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-goes-his-own-way-with-vladimir-putin-1463172396).

 A few minutes before he made those remarks, Mr. Trump met at a VIP reception with Russias ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Ivanovich Kislyak. Mr. Trump warmly greeted Mr. Kislyak and three other foreign ambassadors who came to the reception.

 Kislyak, according to multiple contemporaneous news reports, was [seated in the front row](http://www.rferl.org/a/us-trump-foreign-policy-speech-russia/27702091.html). It was an invitation-only event.

This seems like an important revelation.

 Trump used the speech to call for warmer relations with Russia.

He has used every speech to do this, though, to be fair. </TEXT>

But, personally, I don't think Carson meant anything bad by what he said, it's just that he is content with having a muddled way of thinking about and defining reality.  And that is rightly being criticized.  

On the other hand, this administration has quite a few historical revisionists in it; maybe he is too.  Either way you slice it, though. his words are incorrect.  Sentiment, which I have to think is what you meant, maybe not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Highlights:

 As camera lights flashed, President-elect Donald J. Trump strode across the lobby of Trump Tower with Masayoshi Son, the colorful Japanese entrepreneur, in December.

 This is Masa of SoftBank from Japan, Mr. Trump said before boasting that Mr. Sons SoftBank  which is in the process of amassing a giant $100 billion fund  had pledged to invest $50 billion in the United States and would create 50,000 jobs here.

 ...

 Yet unmentioned that day  and largely unremarked upon  is that Mr. Sons $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund could reasonably be described as a front for Saudi Arabia and perhaps other countries in the Middle East.

 Saudi Arabia is the majority investor in the fund, with some $45 billion pledged. A state-owned investment company from Abu Dhabi, Mubadala Development, is in negotiations to invest $15 billion as well. Qatar is also in talks to invest in the fund.

 This is not a secret to anyone who has been paying even a modicum of attention to the news that has dribbled out about the fund.

 This column isnt taking a position on the politics or the morality of taking money from Saudi Arabia. But it is a conversation that is worth having.

 ....

 In fairness to Mr. Trump, if he does want to bring huge investment sums to the United States, it is hard do that without involving some countries with which we have had complicated relationships. Some of the largest money is tied up in vast sovereign wealth funds.

 Not all of the $50 billion investment that Mr. Son pledged to make here is likely to come from SoftBanks Vision Fund, the one backed by Saudi Arabia. Some of it may come directly from SoftBank, which owns Sprint and is hoping to merge it with T-Mobile.

 All that said, can you imagine if Mr. Trump stood in the lobby of Trump Tower with Prince Mohammed talking about a $50 billion investment in the United States from Saudi Arabia?

 Its hard to see  but then again, stranger things have happened. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My claim is this: The bulk of services provided by PP are things other than abortion, and so if federal funding for those services disappears, in lieu of some other funding source, PP will no longer be able to provide the bulk of their services, and thus will have to close because they will no longer have access to a critical stream of incoming cash flow.  Abortion will be then be unavailable because ALL PP services will be unavailable, so it will be indirectly affected.

I was just asking for something to substantiate what you were claiming, not to make you look bad but so that if I was missing information or misunderstanding the way it works, I could learn.

Lastly, I was separating the services.  I didn't provide a link, although I can if you ask, but there are numerous sources showing a detailed, evidence-based explanation of how PP receives federal funding, and from what I understand, it's done through reimbursements.  So again... if PP sends a bill to the federal government, they list what service was provided.  If abortion was on the list, they wouldn't receive reimbursement.

Now, do you not believe that's the way it works, or do you think that PP is lying when they send the bill, and providing abortions but listing something else?  And/or are you saying they get federal funding in other ways, and they use that to funnel funding to abortion?  

I'm just confused on what you are actually claiming.  Please don't search for subtext in my post.  I'm asking you in earnest. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  A White House statement congratulating ExxonMobil for increasing investment in Texas and Louisiana cribbed multiple lines from the oil giant's statement without citation.  

 The White House statement, which includes quotes from President Donald Trump, pulled this quote nearly word-for-word from ExxonMobil 's statement:
 "ExxonMobil is strategically investing in new refining and chemical-manufacturing projects in the United States Gulf Coast region to expand its manufacturing and export capacity. The company's Growing the Gulf program consists of 11 major chemical, refining, lubricant and liquefied natural gas projects at proposed new and existing facilities along the Texas and Louisiana coasts. Investments began in 2013 and are expected to continue through at least 2022."

Here is what [ExxonMobil wrote](http://news.exxonmobil.com/press-release/exxonmobil-plans-investments-20-billion-expand-manufacturing-us-gulf-region):
  "ExxonMobil is strategically investing in new refining and chemical-manufacturing projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast region to expand its manufacturing and export capacity.

No abortions services are funded this way unless you are saying the Federal government sees "abortion" as a line-item and cuts a check anyways.

<TEXT>  According to a new poll from [Monmouth University released Monday](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_US_030617/), just 39 percent of U.S. adults said they believe the original travel ban was a good idea. Meanwhile, 49 percent said the executive order  which targeted people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  was a bad idea.  
  
 The poll, taken before the White House announced the new version of its executive order on Monday, found that approximately the same number  50 percent  said Trump should have moved on from the ban to other issues, compared with 38 percent who favored his decision to take a second stab at it. The margin of error for the results was 3.5 percentage points. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Her explanation is explanationless.  Otherwise, if it was worth anything, you could use it to explain why an investigation into anything would be neededif only the President tweets that he believes it.  It's a replay of the voter fraud claims, because the same explanation was used to defend his call for an investigation there.  You could just as well imagine up any scenario and insert any question:

*"Why did the President say on Twitter today that he believes Bigfoot is real and caused the protests at Standing Rock... that they are pouring in from Canada's wide open liberal borders?"*

 Look, I think he's going off of information that he's seen that has led him to believe that this is a very real potential, Huckabee Sanders responded. I think hes made very clear what he believes, and hes asking that we get down to the bottom of this, get the truth here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1/3 is too high yet (although to be sure, it's less support than Trump himself has), but still, this works to undermine Trump's claim that Americans want a $54B increase in defense spending.  If this poll is a good gauge, it is saying 59% of Americans would oppose an increase in spending (28% say we spend right amount, 31% say we spend too much). </TEXT>

He looks like a complete lackey and stinks of being compromised ethically here: Nunes holds a press conference declaring no investigation needed and denying CNN's 'constant contact' report , but Trump's impulsive, angry 140-character baseless accusation yields an investigation from him?  Honestly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ***FINAL EDIT: HOLY SHIT NO ONE GIVES A FUCK ABOUT NECROCHASM!!!!***

**DPS TABLE AT BOTTOM**

For anyone interested in this new exotic, I noted the damage I was doing on today's daily with all my auto rifles.  I include my own fire rate times below too measured using stopwatch averaged over 5 times.  I intend to convert it to DPS but am too lazy this very moment, so I'll edit it in if people are interested in these numbers.

**The numbers below are 1 bullet's worth of damage from a 32 warlock shooting a 30 goblin.  The upper number is the upper threshold of damage caused by the perks/fire method in the third column.**


Attack | Name | Perks | Body shot (DMG) | Critical Shot (DMG) | Fire Rate | Notes 
--------|--------|-------|-------------|---------------|--------------------|--------|
339 | Necrochasm | | 80 | 198 | 14.84 bullets/s | explosion does a static amount of damage unlike Firefly, processes about 2/3 the time.  Something around ~928 damage
331 | Abyss Defiant | ADS using Focus Fire | 140 | 348 | 5.81 bullets/s |
331 | Vanquisher VIII | Crowd Control | 142 - 163 | 353 - 406 | 7.46 bullets/s |
323 | Vex Mythoclast | Crowd Control | 175 - 201 | 523 - 605 | 6.02 shots/s | Melty
312 | SUROS Regime | ADS with Focus Fire | 193 - 292 | 456 - 730 | 4.88 bullets/s | Only at 312 Attack.  
302 | Hard Light | | 97 | 242 | 10.04 bullets/s | Virgin gun.  Sorry hard light I swear I'll upgrade you
300 | Atheon's Epilogue | Glass Half Full | 61 - 65 | 152 - 162 | 15.35 bullets/s |


Again, ranges indicate lower threshold (minimum) and upper threshold (maximum) of the gun's damage based on the perks.

Attack | Name | Body DPS | Crit DPS | Average DPS
--------|--------|-------|-------------|---------------|--------------------|--------|
339 | Necrochasm | 1187.20 DMG/s | 2938.32 DMG/s |  ?
331 | Abyss Defiant | 813.4 DMG/s | 2021.88 DMG/s | ?
331 | Vanquisher VIII | 1059.32 - 1141.38 DMG/s | 2633.88 - 3026.78 DMG/s | ?
323 | Vex Mythoclast | 1053.50 - 1210.02 DMG/s | 3148.46 DMG/s - 3642.10 DMG/s | ?
312 | SUROS Regime | 941.84 - 1424.96 DMG/s | 2225.28 - 3562.40 DMG/s | ?
302 | Hard Light | 973.88 DMG/s | 2429.68 DMG/s | ?
300 | Atheon's Epilogue | 936.35 - 997.75 DMG/s | 2333.20 - 2486.70 DMG/s | ?


And here's a short gameplay video of it: http://xboxclips.com/viccaro/6a518b4c-3cd1-468a-ba5b-d34e2326c87c

If anyone has any additional ARs they have damage stats for that want to add to the table, please share.

EDIT: added DPS table.  sorted both tables by attack. looks like Vex still does the most damage although if my Suros was 331, it's upper threshold crit would hurdle it over the Vex.  If anyone has improvements on this data post a comment  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Shameless self-pity thread.  Wanted to reroll my Titan.  Forgot to check inventory before deleting him (apparently).. went to go buy stuff from Xur just now, and have none of it.  So here's what I lost:

* 1528 Weapon Parts
* 252 Ascendant Energies
* 120 Ascendant Shards
* 18 Radiant Energies
* 6 Radiant Shards
* 500 Plasteel plating
* 60 strange coins
* 25 motes of light

edit--
* 8 exotic shards
* 100+ planetary mats of each (eh whatever)
* 30 resupply codes.. grr!

Feel my pain..  I'm so dumb. Sigh

<TITLE> SGA: you can skip the reef cutscenes </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-09 07:31:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> At least the first one.

After the first cutscene where you are flying through the ship graveyard and gain 2 friendly Awoken escorts, the game loads another cutscene where you are meeting with the Queen.  It also shows a saving/loading indicator in the bottom right that something is happening during the transition between these 2 cutscenes, so I decided to test for science if you could just go to "Change Character" from there.  I logged right back in and the next few Venus missions were unlocked, so it works.

I did search and didn't find this posted outside of the "you can skip the 30 second countdown" SGAs and it was news to me </TEXT>

<TITLE> Another solo Crota video with alternate Ogre strategy </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-04 20:41:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> These may be getting more and more boring each and every time a solo Guardian extinguishes Crota, but after hours of wrestling with the oversized blue bastard that the Hive call a godgetting him to a sliver of health only to have him enrageI finally bested Crota with my warlock, feel all proud and stuff, and wanted to share the video.  Most especially because of my ogre strategy, wondering if anyone else tackles them this way..

This video misses my first sword because of Xbox DVR constraints, but I took him down the first time using fusion grenades and Touch of Flame to save heavy ammo.  The video picks up as I attack the second swordbearer.  Watch out for 3rd swordbearer, where Crota doesn't go down to 2 Gjallarhorns and forces some improvisation.

EDIT: well update since i just hit 32 on my hunter.. better video from *first* sword, same strategy, no mistakes:

<TEXT> This may be common sense or such obvious advice that I couldn't turn anything up in search, but I figured I'd post it anyways.  Heavy ammo synth is overpriced, so what's a poor Guardian to do when faced with Juggler?

* 1) Shoot rocket at mob from distance
* 2) Switch to primary immediately before rocket hits
* 3) Watch it rain purple ammo (or be smited by the RNGod of Ammo)

Happy reset day. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The reason why this week's strikes are DLC content is because.. [spoilers] </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> ...they are the last link in the The Dark Below's quest chain.  



From the very start of the story through to the end, you face off against Omnigul a number of times in a number of different ways.  You only get to ultimately try to kill her in the new strike.

If this is common knowledge then happily ignore this post.  I did do some searching but didn't see it mentioned. And judging from the uproar about it, and the fact that there *IS* even SGA about how to unlock the weekly, makes me think it is not.  It is obvious, once you complete the chain of bounties, that the weekly strikes had to be locked since they are the endgame of the DLC's story (besides the raid, not sure how that ties in, havent done it yet).

Bungie used the weekly strikes as a vehicle for the last link in the story.  It was not done to passive-aggressively force you to spend $20.00 to continue playing what I imagine is one of your favorite games (to be on this sub), Bungie is just merely utilizing the platform they built.

<TEXT> Over the holiday break, I raided with my 3 characters and whilst using my 30 Lock I joined up with a pure Warlock death squad.  We all signed up to take on Atheon on HM, and were all out of there in less than 10 minutes.  It had to be my best run ever, so I was obligated to capture a video.  I did NOT expect 6 locks to drop Atheon this quick without WoL.

<TEXT> Late day work musings...

I am sad to say I have not once yet stumbled upon any of you on Destiny.. obviously it is granted that 1) not all of you are on XB1 and 2) it is a massive game with a huge population of players that gets split up regionally often...  but still.  I even teamed up with a group from /r/fireteams last night for the HM raid, but only the person that invited me was from reddit.

Anyways, just curious, anyone see each other out in the wild?  What percentage of players on Destiny also frequent this sub, or is it just too low to matter? </TEXT>

This game really wants me to be a hunter I guess.  Can't get an exotic helm/raid helm to save my light for my would-be-30 Titan but do have 4 exotics and 2 legendaries for a hunter.  Ugh.  Anyone else in a similar spot?  Not complaining per se though, as I just made a hunter and once he hits 20 he'll almost be decked out.

<TITLE> Thought for VoG secret chests: Equip raid class items? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-10 15:32:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last night on Hard Mode the raid group I was in was doing some exploring on the jumping puzzle, and encountered a secret cave room.  If you go to the left when you first spawn, past the jumping platforms, you come to a rock tunnel that leads to a cliff.  About 200 feet below is a platform that spawns.. when you hear it, you can free fall, and you'll land on it.  It takes you to the secret room.. and you can see the Broken Timegate from there, as well.  I have no pictures but the guys I was with got some videos, hopefully i can get them to post here with them.

We obviously spawned no chest, but were speculating on how a conditional chest could appear there.  Since then I had a thought that I haven't seen, I think, anyone try.  So I'll ask.. has anyone tried conditional things in that area with the Raid class items equipped?  Would if the entire team needs to have their cloak, bond, or mark from the raid equipped?  Anyone try this yet? </TEXT>

<TITLE> PSA: Ammo Synthesis does not work if you have a full consumable inventory </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-31 21:45:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I keep seeing people reporting this bug on this subreddit, yet the fix is known.  If you have a full consumable inventory, your ammo synthesis, be it primary, special, or heavy, will not work.  It will consume the synth pack and give you 0 ammo and the fun 5 minute cooldown timer.

So, have at least 1 consumable slot open before using a synthesis pack!

That is all.  Hope this prevents future posts and helps anyone still struggling with this.. it has been the cause of certain death in many a raid. </TEXT>
