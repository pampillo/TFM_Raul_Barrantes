<TEXT> I can see perhaps that one might need manual controls to move the car in a blizzard or other extreme conditions which the automatics can't handle. 

I really don't see any future in the idea of a self-driving car doing its thing while a person has to set there, ready to grab the wheel if anything goes wrong. Nobody will keep paying attention to the road for hours on end like that. There would also be no cost-saving for companies who currently employ drivers. </TEXT>

The government has resisted doing proper studies of the effects of their changes. However it's clear to me, working in the field, that the majority of families affected by the new cap are Muslim. It doesn't seem unreasonable that the movement of those families out of cities into more rural areas might have had an influence on the EU referendum.      </TEXT>

<TEXT> It would be interesting to know how many of his finacial interests now are related in some way to being popular with the Bush administration.

As for the oil point, I think it seems very likely that a wish to put the oilfields in more amenable hands was a motive. I actually am a little persuaded by the argument that a resource like that is too important to the whole world to be left in the hands of such a despot. 

Even if the reasoning was purely for the enrichment of Bush's personal friends in the oil and other industries, that's still a motive for Blair separate from war for the sake of war. </TEXT>

He must have thought that the war would have effects which would be a benefit in some way, even if it was just for his own welfare. I don't see a direct advantage for him though. I don't think the after-dinner speaking circuit would have been so attractive for him.

Personally I hypothesise that he thought the geopolitical situation for the UK would be better after the war if we supported the USA, than if we had stayed out of it. He unwisely thought the advantages of this would outweigh the harm caused by using deception to justify our involvement. </TEXT>

His family and the congregation of the church had communion while we sat at the back. However when he was taken to his grave it wasn't in a Catholic graveyard but a Protestant one nearby. None of the congregation except his parents came to his burial. Suddenly it was just us, his London friends. Its been 17 years but it still makes me angry. </TEXT>

I don't think yearly inspections are very workable, but it doesn't seem unreasonable to try and incorporate it into a health-check at some point.

I still don't really see how yearly inspections could make it worse. It would no doubt harm community relations, but probably not the FGM situation itself. </TEXT>

I see your edit. I am wondering in what way questioning the parents thoroughly could make it worse though? 

Remember we are talking about the grievous and permanent mutilation of children. It might be made worse if as a result FGM happened to more children, or more serious types of FGM were applied, or if children were harmed even more severely in some other way. I can't see any of those being a likely consequence. </TEXT>

I'm encouraged by the statement, but discouraged by the results. We have over 150 known cases which have not been put forward for prosecution for various reasons. Are we confident everything that could be done to collect evidence was done? I am just not. Sorry.


victims of FGM may not want to report it if it means them being put into care or their parents interrogated.

Yes I have read about that. I think its a case where the well-being of other children outweighs the sensitivities of victims who enable the crime. Obviously child victims need to be treated with care, but adults, not so much if they are being obstructive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> using them as some kind of deterrent? Come on.

No-one likes being arrested. If mutilating parents know that at a minimum they are going to give a full account of their actions, in a police interview room, then yes, I think that could have a useful deterring effect which is protective of people's rights.

we need level heads rather than desperation.

We need action. Currently everyone is standing around wringing their hands while hundreds of children are mutilated. How much longer should we hum and ha about it? It's been decades already and if anything its getting worse.

It could even make things worse.

I'm intrigued by that. What are you thinking of?

What do you suggest we do? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You really seem to lack understanding of how police interviews actually work. They are dull as ditchwater, even for serious rapes and murders.

Quite. Jazz them up a bit for these cases. Don't get distracted by the light-in-face description. It's figurative. There is certainly no harm in at least asking a parent if they knowingly caused grievous bodily harm to their daughter. I don't understand why everyone is so opposed to this.

Fine, but proving it is the hurdle they need to overcome.

Proof and prosecution isn't entirely necessary if parents get to know that they will be interrogated at length if they allow it to be done. That in itself can be a deterrent, and educative.

Also proof beyond reasonable doubt isn't required to take children at risk into protective care.

Yes exactly. That is something that might work, and which doesn't seem to be tried in this issue. It is done for other crimes so why not this?

Then what? Go to Ethiopia and arrest their Auntie who took them to some doctor who carried it out 10 years ago?

<TEXT> To be honest I don't know why we aren't prosecuting but I doubt it's a conspiracy. 

From articles I have read on it I think the main problem with prosecution is that it is rarely detected until long after it occurred, and the parents can just deny that they knew about it, to the extent that it would be hard to make a conviction stick. Also I expect there are 'cultural sensitivities' meaning the police are squeamish about arresting people, similar to the issues with Pakistani sex abuse gangs that we have seen. 
This is why I think a good thorough grilling for parents would be an improvement on the current situation. Some might make statements which make prosecution easier. Some might make statements which would justify the removal of their children from their household. Some would not confess but would find the process uncomfortable and would tell their relatives and friends what might happen to them.

there are stories of grandparents looking after kids who get it done behind parents' backs. Then the parents are in an awful situation too, how many of us would send our own parents to jail?

Haul the grandparents in, shine a light in their face and give them a thorough grilling for 24 hours. These people are serious and unrepentant child abusers. Don't let them get away with it scot-free. Don't let their enablers enable them.

We need to create an environment where the parents can come forwards and get help and support for the kids and if we only do that with blame and jail then, again, we will just push them away from the help the child needs.

I understand your sentiment, but I don't think there are significant numbers of people coming forward about this.

<TEXT> It sounds interesting. It does sound different to the UK were as far as I know anglers don't always expect to catch anything, I think there are some special private fishing ponds where that might be the norm, but not with general rivers, canals, lakes, or seas.

I'm surprised that the USA waters sound more closely managed than UK ones, which goes against my preconceptions of US wilderness etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One thing counter to that that I have noticed, really since using reddit, is that some women claim the absolute right to have an abortion, because of their bodily autonomy. This is a harder, and more principled stance than that common in the UK, which is that abortion must be available when it would be harmful to the mother to continue the pregnancy. That is determined by two doctors here, not by the pregnant woman.

So there is a tension between the rights of the pregnant woman, and the right of the foetus, even though the foetus is not a person until it is born. (in the UK the time limit for abortion is set at the typical point at which a foetus can survive if removed from the pregnant woman's body). </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the UK we have had free contraception for a very long time. It has certainly reduced family sizes, as have other changes such as reduced infant mortality and state pensions. (with welfare like pensions, you don't need as many kids to keep you in old age). Also it is culturally normal now for men and women to have children later, for career and financial reasons.

The number of large families, of five or more children is pretty small. They are mainly families with religious or cultural reasons for not using contraception.  I work in government stats so it's something I look at occasionally. The cost of them is not huge because they are few. (my source for this is me unfortunately - we haven't published this data)

Despite this the government has recently brought in measures to limit welfare payments to the first two children. As the average is something like 2.4 children this is quite draconian. It remains to be seen what effect it will have. However my bet is that the religious people will continue to have large families, and will live in greater relative poverty for that reason. Its not going to be good for those kids, or their effect on society later. [The Child Poverty Action Group have some stats on that.](http://cpag.org.uk/content/two-child-limit-universal-credit-200000-more-children-put-poverty)

<TEXT>  First, the airline didnt use force.

Maybe the airport security are the culpable party here. In that case though I might have expected the CEO to just say it was nothing to do with United.

Second, when asked to leave private property and you refuse, you are then trespassing which doesnt make you " law-abiding"

He has paid to have that seat though hasn't he? One might draw an analogy with a tenant of a home. The landlord can't just tell them to leave and them beat them up for trespassing when they don't. I know this principle is derived from different legislation however.

You mean the people who are acting as agents of the OWNERS of the private property i.e. the plane? Of course they can tell you to get off.

Sure they can tell you to get off. The question is what is the limit of their power to remove a passenger who isn't doing anything wrong, other than sitting in their seat? Would the airline staff be justified in killing him? There is obviously a limit somewhere. I'd suggest it's before the point at which a 68-year old man has his face bloodied and requires hospital care.

Anyway a real court will decide at some point and us armchair lawyers can discuss it again then. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Nobody but the most desperate would sell their houses

Assuming that the prices didn't recover, then eventually people would sell. They would either take less profit, or a loss in doing so.

We HAD a crash in 2008 and it sucked for everyone apart from those with enough money to buy near outright.

The problem with that though, was that credit was unavailable. The lenders might slow down, as you say, but they could not shut down all activity. They would put rates up, I suppose. There would be competition among lenders. </TEXT>

You mean they would no longer have the collateral to cover a new mortgage? 

It seems like a pretty obscure circumstance. How many people buy and expect to change mortgages, and rely on the price having remained stable, or gone up? If they could afford the repayments on the higher initial price, they should be able to continue paying that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Which law is that?

I think the relevant question here is whether the airline can use force to remove a law-abiding customer from its plane. I could see justification in a situation affecting the safety or comfort of other passengers. I think it's less clear that simple refusal  leave so that another can have the seat justifies use of force.

I don't think refusal to obey the crew can be a universal offense. Imagine if the crew ordered a passenger to do something dangerous or illegal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I read an article a few years ago about some researchers who tried to find what common beliefs are held between all groups that call themselves Christians and they couldn't find any. Christianity is a lot more diverse than most people think.

At what point though, is it appropriate to reclassify somebody as not a Christian? I know an enthusiastic Catholic who says she doesn't believe in sin or redemption or the resurrection, or transubstantiation, and expects to be reincarnated. 

The National Secular Society, and Richard Dawkins among others called for better questions in the 2011 census, so as to separate cultural affiliation from actual religious belief. We over-count theists of all types, and this leads to distorted polices and funding for schools etc.

<TEXT> It wasn't the United Kingdom before the acts of Union joined Scotland and England. Once those acts are repealed, it would be inaccurate to call it a united kingdom. I guess there would be kingdoms of Scotland, and of England. Northern Ireland could potentially go too, don't forget that.

<TEXT> There was the Scottish Independence vote of 2014, though it might be argued that there was not a real risk, as the vote was safely for the union. 

I don't think any of the wars of the later 20th century put the UK at risk, and nor did the Suez crisis although that apparently dented the British Empire.

When Germany still had plans to invade us in WW2, so during the blitz and up to about 1941, but not really beyond were dangerous.

The 1921 war for independence in Ireland could potentially have taken all of Ireland (this risk now seems at its most elevated since then).

I don't think WW1 put the country at risk of invasion.

The campaigns of Napoleon III might have got to us eventually.

What else?

<TEXT> French cooking is subtle. I do have to hand it to them.

However British food gets a bad rap. What we should be famous for is having the greatest range of international styles available.  The British foods are enjoying a renaissance too. It has a bad reputation as there was rationing from WW2 which only ended in 1955. In the post war years our food producers put so much effort into bulk production and shelf-life that taste took a serious hit. That is all finished now though. </TEXT>

He seemed to take ages and saturated the pile with fuel while nothing happened.  A few small flames licked around the bottom but that's all.  It was just dawning on me that it was looking dangerous when WWHHOOUUFFFFF! 

Simon was inside the fireball. With idiot's luck he was ok bar singed hair and a burned finger. 

Then the fire went back down to a few licking flames again.

<TEXT>  for that vote to be blocked, there had to be more than one tory rebel (Ken Clarke) who opposed it, otherwise the Tories have the majority,and even if all Labour, SNP, LIBDems etc voted against it would still not be enough. 

That's not necessarily true as not all the Tories voted.

This is an argument against all parliamentary votes. You might as well scrap parliament and give the legislative power to the PM if that's the way you think. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah. Christians don't view the world in the same sceptical way that atheists tend to. To us contradictions in scripture are evidence against the claim that it is divinely created or inspired. 

You are fairly unusual in embracing contradictions though. It's really common for Christians to be unaware of them, or just to hold contradictory ideas without feeling a need to reconcile them. They become evasive when asked about them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Christian god is purportedly omni-benevolent.

Here are the original lyrics anyway, including its endorsement of the class system:

1.
All things bright and beautiful,
All creatures great and small,
All things wise and wonderful,
The Lord God made them all.

2.
Each little flower that opens,
Each little bird that sings,
He made their glowing colours,
He made their tiny wings.

All things bright ...

3.
The rich man in his castle,
The poor man at his gate,
God made them high and lowly,
And ordered their estate.

All things bright ...

4.
The purple headed mountain,
The river running by,
The sunset and the morning,
That brightens up the sky;

All things bright ...

5.
The cold wind in the winter,
The pleasant summer sun,
The ripe fruits in the garden,
He made them every one:

All things bright ...

6.
The tall trees in the greenwood,
The meadows where we play,
The rushes by the water,
We gather every day;

All things bright ...

7.
He gave us eyes to see them,
And lips that we might tell,
How great is God Almighty,
Who has made all things well.

All things bright ...

(Amen)

<TEXT>  He was straight-jacketed into campaigning for Remain by the vast majority of Labour MPs. Did as best he could to campaign for Leave at the same time.

Indeed. He seems piss-weak.

Tory Brexit may be shit, but it looks like the most obvious route back into power for Labour.

The other way is to elect a leader and develop polices and ways of presenting them which appeal to the majority of voters in the swingable seats. There are presumably quite a few of these seats so there is probably more than one approach that might work. Blair and the rest figured out one way.

And then the country can be put right again.

He's doing so badly in opposition that I dread to think what he would be like in power. I guess we will never know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Corbyn wants Brexit because he doesn't like the EU.

That seems reasonably likely. I wonder though why he couldn't find it in himself to campaign to Leave in the referendum? That runs counter to the Corbynite notion that he is very consistent and principled.

He also wants the Tories to make a pig's ear of it.

That seems very short-sighted, and disloyal to the country. Wishing the Tories would look bad is understandable, but wishing they would hurt Labour supporters is not understandable to me.

He also wants to recover the working class vote that New Labour abandoned.

I expect he does see it that way. Some would say that New Labour successfully recovered the working class vote that Old Labour abandoned in the 80s, and is abandoning again.

The United Kingdom might not survive the medium-future. Its lose lose lose.

<TEXT> Are you being deliberately obtuse? There are pro-remain and pro single market Tory MPs. Even without any coherent action from Corbyn May is unable to command full loyalty, with some high-profile dissenters in her own ranks.

At the very least Corbyn could have made May's zombie-walk uncertain of reaching the cliff. He would only need to persuade about 5% of the Tories not to support leaving the Single Market, and there are well over that many who have stated that is their view.

I guess that is out of Corbyn's reach, but I don't think it would be out of the reach of a competent and sufficiently-principled Labour leader. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But their job was to protect people, at least those on the planes. They didn't do their job properly. They didn't protect those people and consequently, those people were killed.

If they had done their job properly, they might not have been killed. This doesn't exonerate the hijackers.

I think if the pilots flying a plane didn't do their jobs properly, and subsequently the passengers were killed, you would acknowledge the fact.

Is it that you are touchy about accepting any responsibility for the US or anyone else other than the hijackers? I understand the sentiment, but not the logic. Nowadays airport security is tighter. That's a good thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I don't know of any verses that talk about the same body resurrected.

There are the gospel accounts about the empty tomb of Jesus, just for a start, though it doesn't necessarily follow that post Jesus resurrections will be different.

Here is the Catholic Encyclopedia on the subject. It's pretty detailed. 

http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12792a.htm

In my experience, religious cults sometimes follow their scripture, but they all deviate from what the words literally say, with varying justifications. 
I don't believe in resurrection at all, so the problem doesn't arise for me.

<TEXT> Thanks for the bible link. It's never surprising when the bible contradicts itself.

You can easily find discussions online among Christians about the resurrection of the body vs the resurrection of the spirit. The Catholic Church, the largest Christian sect with 1.2 billion members says its the body.

Protestantism, the second largest group of Christians with 800 million, is mixed on the question, Eastern Orthodox with 270 millions say its the body, Oriental orthodoxy says its the body, Anglicanism is mixed (I am pretty sure I discussed it with an Anglican Vicar some years ago, though I can only find sources saying the body at the moment), the Mormons say its the body, and so on down the list.

I'll guess that you are from a Protestant background, as am I. Well, the views of churches vary on many things, but this type of resurrection is certainly a standard doctrine of worldwide Christianity. It's the more modern Christian groups who tend to have adopted a spirit-only model, as they in some ways have adapted more fully to modern scientific knowledge about atoms and chemical processes.

They were not identified in the 9/11 Commission report which detailed their failings.

I do think that the fact that if they had performed their duties correctly, that those hijackers would have been stopped and probably that plane saved, was significant. I am not sure offhand which of the targets that plane hit.

Whenever I comment about this people comment back to defend them, but I don't know why. They were not doing their jobs properly and this had the worst possible consequences. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And a simple policy of anybody who enters the country illegally is always deported, either to the country that they last came from or to the country that they claim to come from.

There is the little matter of international law to consider there. If we just break it arbitrarily that will encourage other countries to break it arbitrarily too. We have a duty to offer asylum to people in certain circumstances. Doing so correctly is often a time-consuming business.

That international agreement exists in part because it's good for the West to protect dissidents from enemy countries. Once safe they tend to exert pressure on their regimes at home in various ways. Consider the effect all the Soviet and German dancers, artists, scientists, writers, and businessmen in the west had during the Cold War.

That said, I don't think we have our system set up optimally. I think Australia has one good policy on asylum in that they will offer asylum, but anyone entering Australia illegally is banned from settling in Australia. Other Australian polices on it are really bad though, and they have high rates of suicide among their pretty terrible refugee camps in the desert.

However, if we were to ban illegal-entrants from settling in the UK, we would have to allow some way for asylum seekers to claim it before entering, which they currently do not have. Doing that would probably encourage applications. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you think that black or Asian people say that all white people look alike? It seems unlikely. I'd be interested if there is any information about that.

Confusing Jackson and Fishburne might also mean an offhand attitude to black actors,  like they aren't distinguished for their individual achievements, and are generic. or it might just mean a lack of interest in black actors compared to white actors, which could be racist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did you delete your comment?

I think it is perceived as racist when white people mistake one black person for another, as it seems as though they don't recognise them as individuals in the same way as with white people, or that they think 'they all look the same'.

With the Mandela thing.. I do find it a bit odd that people think Mandela died in prison. I guess it demonstrates a lack of awareness of black history to not know about his eventual release from prison and his achievement to become first black president of South Africa, and to not know that black people were deprived of the right to vote until then.

While it might not be racist as such it does seem a bit ignorant about race history and issues. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Unless, that is you have evidence that says that white people mix up black people because of the fact that they are black, and they are the only race to do so.

Does that strike you as unlikely? I don't know of any data, but white people have more physical variation in hair and eye colour than black and Asian people. Also I think lighter skin shows more texture more easily, and this could mean a tendency for white people to use those things for recognition.
Black and Asian people in their communities would need to rely on other features for recognition.

There are stories about the media mixing-up black actors in a way which doesn't seem to happen as much or as painfully as with white actors.

http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/samuel-jackson-laurence-fishburne-mixup-don-alike-article-1.1608899

https://mymajicdc.hellobeautiful.com/3646283/give-us-strength-white-medias-emmys-coverage-mixed-up-so-many-black-actors/

Even if it is not statistically true, it seems to be something which black people are concerned about. </TEXT>

I don't think you could really do that without just seeming like you know nothing about 20th century art. There is loads of that type of thing. The good stuff was around 100 years ago. That's when this idea was new and interesting. There has been a century of intellectual progress since then.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readymades_of_Marcel_Duchamp

I guess the real key idea is that physical craft and skill ceased to be so important in the machine age. After we could make objects without manual skill, the value in object and artworks had to be in the ideas they presented, not so much in their physical forms. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, welcome to /r/atheism ;) 

We discuss the harm caused by religion pretty often here.  
You can only say so much about there being insufficient evidence to believe in gods.

The main features of the 'new' atheism are that it is agnostic, and anti-theistic.

Edit: also the writer of the article is a Muslim, so its not as simple as to be an anti-Muslim post. He is calling for different standards among Muslims than that which give this professor a platform.

<TEXT> We joined the common market in 1973, and the UK is on course to leave it.  That might affect the movement of goods and services over the Gibraltar border. Gibraltar is totally reliant on food imports, which are likely to become more expensive.

The Maastrict Treaty with the right to free movement of people came into affect in 1993 as you say. However the situation post-Brexit might not be identical to the situation pre-1993. Theresa May has indicated that stopping free movement is essential for her and the EU has indicated that they see the UK and Gibraltar borders as the same.

There is lots of concern about it in the Gibraltan media if you care to google it.
The [Gibraltan Chief Minister thinks it's a problem.](http://www.satprnews.com/2017/02/02/gibraltar-urges-meps-to-work-towards-sensible-brexit/)

So you can't just hand-wave the issue away. Some special deal needs to be made.

It is quite possible that the UK will lose its relationship with Gibraltar over Brexit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Christianity is more about personal revelation than is Islam, which seems more about societal rules, though there is quite a bit of overlap of course.

Most Christians are not bothered at all for example, that if you take all the verses about the crucifixion and the resurrection from all four gospels, and try to put them in a logical order, that there is basically no way you can do it. Some of the gospels *must* be untrue.

I did post a link about Koranic variations elsewhere in the thread though. It looks to me as though there are quite a few, but that its a taboo subject and not addressed by Islamic scholars. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes I have written about this elsewhere in the thread. My view is that there is nothing special about old Arabic compared to any other language. Try translating William Shakespeare into Japanese.

There are always problems with translation between languages, the actual definitional meaning of any sentence can almost always be replicated, with careful choice of words, and additional qualifications. The rhythm, rhyme and style is more problematic.

But in a nutshell, if you can learn the language of the Koran, you can also translate it. That's what you are doing in your own head when you read it.

Have you got any particular examples of untranslatable parts of the Koran in mind? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks. Bart Ehrman is always a good read about this stuff I find. In the case of the Koran I think it does have an advantage over the Gospels, in that it was written during Mohammed's life, rather than 40-200 years later.

Having said that I don't believe in gods so the age and authorship of these books is of academic rather than practical interest to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually quite a few religions have 'unmodified' texts. Judaism has the Torah in Hebrew, The Mormons have the (admittedly transparent fake) Book of Mormon in English. Scientology texts are in English.

The New Testament is an exception. We have Greek and Latin versions, and some Hebrew I think, but the original Aramaic of Jesus was oral and is lost.

I think if you go digging then there are problems with the transcriptions of the Koran and Haddiths too, but there isn't much scholarly criticism of the sceptical variety as with the Bible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's arguable that words always have slightly different nuances between people even if they are in the same language. 

What does the Koran contain? I believe it has observations about life, instructions on how to live and historic stories? I don't think there is anything among those that can't be rendered in a different language, aside from rhythm and style? Poetic or literary style can have a more  difficult nuance.

<TEXT> In some ways I find it refreshing compared to Christian apologists, who often say that the words in the bible mean other things in their original languages.

At least the Koran in Arabic is pretty much the same as the original. The Hadiths on the other hand are potentially very different from the original statements.

Edit: [oh there is a pretty big list of potential Koranic variations here.](http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Text/) But I am no expert. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  At least then it'll be your interpretation, not some other person's

That can be a bad thing with historical texts. A good translation will be done by an expert, or a group of experts.

It's also in the Islamic laws that you can't read the Qur'an in a different language (they are considered interpretations not the actual Qur'an) and you need to read it in Arabic to avoid a chain of interpretations changing the overall meaning

Yes I understand. However I am sceptical that there is anything special about the Koran in this regard. All complex or historical texts will pose challenges to a translator, in presenting every nuance in the new version. Its not impossible though, translation is a sophisticated craft.

Just to pick something completely at random, consider the poem [*Faint Heart on a Railway Train*](http://everything2.com/title/Faintheart+in+a+Railway+Train) by Thomas Hardy. In English, the first stanza can be read in a rhythm like the sound of a train. In the second stanza this breaks down and becomes much more fluid. This possibly represents the break in the routine of the character in the narrative. To translate this into Arabic, or any sufficiently different language, I  think this rhythmic nuance will be hard to carry over. There is a great deal of symbolism in it too, which will present other problems.

Edit: I added a part about Koranic exceptionalism, but its getting off-point so I have taken it out again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:
    1. Anything that is in the world when youre born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.
    2. Anything that's invented between when youre fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
    3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.

<TEXT> I think we are going around in circles now. Can we agree that churches accept money from their members? All seem to accept tithes which are 10%. Some mandate tithes which are 10%. Many or most allow a lower rate or none from those unable to afford it.

I think we have lost track of the point here, which is that churchgoers generally pay their churches for services and facilities provided. It's not hugely different from paying to be a member of a gym or social club.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 'whatever he can afford' is quite a hefty charge if it doesn't have a limit.

There are many thousands of churches around the world, RC, COE, and COS are only three of them (albeit with most of the members in the UK),

Edit: I was just googling about the Church of Scotland's policy, [and found this pdf](http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/2371/stewardship_2004report.pdf). They seem to consider tithing to be 10% by definition, and the question is whether to recommend tithing, or recommend something else. In any case, they aim to collect money from their congregations.

I think in summary, that most churches are keen to side-step the ugly business of having a published price, but they want 10%. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [The word tithe literally means 10%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithe) so if I were a pedant I might argue that all tithes are 10% by definition.

However of course people do make donations to churches of other amounts. Nearly All churches whose policy I know allow lower amounts for those who can't afford them. However all Christians I have discussed this with either pay 10% or aspire to pay 10%

The CoE General Synod promotes an amount of 5%, though the [Archbishop of the time argued for 10%,](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/the-church-of-englands-general-synod-carey-suggests-10-tithe-from-rich-anglicans-1533072.html) again from those who can afford it. 5% is still a rather significant sum, so my I stand by my point even in that case.

As discussed elsewhere the CoE makes hundreds of millions from its other business activities so evidently doesn't need to charge its customers directly. 

The Roman Catholic Church seems at pains to say that no fixed amount is required, but that an amount is required. I haven't found a webpage in which they state their policy which doesn't mention 10%, while saying that isn't mandatory.

The mormons  mandate 10%.

I'd be interested to know what churches you are thinking of, as 10% does seem typical among smaller churches in London. The figure of 10% seems to come from Genesis 28:22. I don't think there is a scriptural basis for any other percentage, though as I said, its common for churches to at least claim that lower amounts are acceptable for those with low incomes. (though as the tithe is proportional anyway, I don't really see the logic of this)

<TEXT> nobody seems to appreciate that most of these organisations are following the law.

I realism that, but I think the law should be changed, to stop commercial  activities of religions from being tax-exempt.

So the logical conclusion is that people want to single out the religious non-profits and tell them to pay more than any other type of non-profit, for what reason apart from discrimination?

Yes that's basically it. Religion is harmful in ways that secular non-profit charitable work is not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, perhaps I wasn't clear. I was talking about natural selection. 

When a living thing reproduces, there are variations in the features of the offspring.  None of these features or variations have any purpose. They are not developed in order to do anything. They are essentially random changes in the genes as they are copied. Most of the variations are neutral or actually harmful to the offspring's chances of reproducing. A smaller proportion of variations however happen to be beneficial for reproduction, and so over time the population will tend to develop those features. 

Evolution by natural selection does not plan ahead in any way. None of the features have purpose.        

Just because a thing is useful in some way is not the same as that being the thing's purpose. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. I think the way I'd proceed would be to ask the affected woman where she was resident at the time it happened, and who was responsible.

She can remain silent, or lie, but I think she should be discouraged from that.

When we have the identity of an adult who was complicit in it, the police should arrest them, put them in an interview room, shine a light in their face and play 'nice cop/nasty cop' with them until they confess, or 24 hours passes. At a minimum that would be uncomfortable for them and word would get around.

If they have any children in their household at that point, they should be taken into care.

Additionally, I wonder if any legal action could be taken against victims who don't reveal who was responsible? That might seem unsympathetic, but don't forget they are in fact to some extent complicit themselves, in that case. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  'at an aircraft' is the key phrase here. 

You say that and yet you immediately qualify it with 'intentionally'.

Now is it, and should it be shining lasers at aircraft which is crime, or intentionally doing so? It seems from the article that they are changing it from the latter, to the former.

I did list some: Firework displays, observatories (which can use lasers to measure atmospheric distortions). Also just playing around with lasers.

Lasers might increase in power. Planes could be very high and still be affected, in clear conditions. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  In terms of the law, I suspect it will only be applied if they catch a chav using a laser pointer. Professional lighting engineers, and professors of astronomy, will get left alone.

Its a bad approach, to make very broad laws then enforce them selectively.

It seems to me that if a person shines a laser at a plane, but there is reasonable doubt about their intentions, then they shouldn't be convicted of trying to dazzle the pilot. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  there would be absolutely nothing stopping an individual juror from deciding based on appearance from start to finish, right? 

I am not sure that there is in general something stopping that in the current system, though you were in a case when the more persuasive members felt that should not happen. What ensures that will usually be the case?

In my idea, the jurors would have a summing-up from the judge, as they do now. He or she should be able to direct on what to consider and what not to consider.

The 'sweet spot' would be selected at such a point to allow for the statistical fact that a certain proportion of jurors do not act reasonably. (whatever proportion that is). </TEXT>

<TITLE> Let's talk about housing policy. What should the government actually do? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-14 22:09:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have some ideas:

1) Government should buy land, or use its existing land to build high quality, low cost homes. It should concentrate on brownfield site in towns and cities, especially around London. It should sell 80% of them and use the remaining ones for fixed-term, renewable council tenancies, of 3-5 years, with right to buy.

2) There should be a lot of them. make it easy to apply for and get one. Limit them to individuals.

3) Prices should be radically low, say 100,000 maximum for a 1-bed flat.

4) There is nothing wrong with high-rise as long as the build, design and maintenance is of sufficient quality.

5) To keep costs low it might be an option to build flats in high-density, with small but innovative designs. I could imagine units the size of static caravans, though of more permanent, insulated and sound-proofed materials.

6) Another cost-saving measure might be to offer units for sale with minimal fittings. Just a bare concrete box which is easily fitted-out by the buyer, as and when they choose. Supply a locking front door, good windows, and the cheapest possible kitchen and bathroom fixtures, to be replaced later.

7) There seems to be lots of space to the East of London (around the Excel centre and further out). Build some mega-estates.

8) There needs to be a robust way of dealing with tenants/buyers who persist in anti-social behaviour, and proper maintenance. Don't allow the estates to become slummy.

9) Include public transport integration. Put in new bus routes at the least.

Any thoughts? What are the downsides?

<TEXT> [Here's the call.](https://youtu.be/jo92MAwtkAM)

I am a little bothered by Matt and Tracie's stance on this one. A few times during the call Matt makes some dismissive remarks about the caller being out of his depth. I was a little bothered by Matt's refusal to acknowledge that matter can become conscious without intelligent intervention. He maintains that he doesn't know whether intelligence is required or not. However, that seems to entail that he does believe matter ~~can~~ might become conscious without intervention.

Any thoughts? Tracie's Skittles analogy doesn't quite hit the spot for me. She should explicitly accept that there could be more green skittles in the jar.

<TEXT> I have noticed that the net monitoring at my work would block some parts or reddit before reddit used https. Now it doesn't. Is that because it can't?

Friends and I were discussing what can middle-men read from https traffic? I imagine the data itself is encrypted, but how about the URL, and the domain being accessed by a user?

In the UK ISPs are to be requested to store urls visited for 1 year. What in practice does this mean they would know? For example, could a political dissident post on reddit or FB without being identified? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am something of a newb at this. I have made some bookshelves in a light-coloured timber. I'd like to stain them to a teak colour or darker. I have been reading about stain product but am a bit baffled by all the types. The timber has some knots, and is quite large-grained new planking. It could be pine. I am more concerned about the colour, quickness of application, and safety of the books than the expense or the durability of the finish.

Anything I should avoid? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Could somebody recommend a power tool for cutting plywood boards down to be shelves? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-04 18:53:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am putting up some bookshelves. on metal brackets which I have already put up. I am looking for a good, rigid, not too ugly, reasonably lightweight material for the selves.

I think 12mm plywood board seems a good bet, like this:

http://www.wickes.co.uk/search?q=plywood%3Arelevance%3ADepth%3A12+mm text=plywood#

However, these boards are 12mm thick and at least 660mm wide. I need to cut them down to 200mm wide. (I might have a few a bit wider for bigger books)

So.. what is a good powertool for that, for one like me who is not very skilled in woodworking, and who really only wants this for a one-off. I can't really justify buying a good table-saw even though I expect that's the best technical option. I see some low quality table-saws which might just be suitable...

Can anyone suggest my approach to the problem? Thanks. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-07-21 23:52:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am 40-something English guy in London. I have just been at my local pub. There is a pokestop about 30 meters away. I am a new player, only level 3.  I am not at all serious about it, and am entertained by new discoveries. I found an egg at the pokestop, and was able to use some incense to attract a clefairy which I captured. 

In summary, I think its important to have a quick look at a game which is obviously so significant globally. To not play it at all just seems to be missing out on essential education to me.

Anyway, one of my drinking buddies said at the end of the evening that he had found my comments about the game to be very boring and antisocial. and he said I act the same way about football. (that I object to others taking about football - I am pretty sure I don't, though I don't find football interesting on the whole)

I feel quite taken aback. It all seems like harmless fun to me but obviously this guy was heavily against it. In the same evening another guy was teased for having a book, that he was reading. That seems relevant somehow.

How are you finding it guys? </TEXT>

If there had been a narrow Remain win, Boris would be poised to take over from Cameron, and to continue in the EU as he believes is easiest for a PM and best for the country? I suppose Gove might still have back-stabbed him in that case. </TEXT>

Thanks for any info on it.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am wondering which to try out. Sainsbury's, Tesco, Ocado etc?

I used Tesco a few years ago, but was annoyed by the massive number of carrier-bags they would use. They used one bag per aisle, or something. Frequently a bag would contain only one item.

Anyway, enough moaning. I imagine they must have stopped that since the 5p law?

What I would really like would be to have an intelligent weekly shopping-list, and a regular weekly delivery time that I could get used to. It I build up a stockpile of something, I'd suppress that item that week. Other, non-perishable things which last longer than a week (eg cleaning products) would occur in the list less frequently, but based on my historical usage. 

Of course I'd be able to order extra items any week, on my phone, on the run. It would be good if they could offer some variety-items too, such as ready-meals of random types, taking account of my likes and dislikes, and allergies or other requirements.

Do any of them do this type of thing, or are they still all incorrigibly shit? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am thinking of something to replicate a random coin-toss, so the coin should flip over several times before landing. It could operate in a vacuum chamber, or in a controlled atmosphere, as that could reduce unpredictable variables. The device should simply throw the coin in a suitably consistent manner to get the same result every time.

Is this simply too exacting in engineering tolerances to be possible? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Can you help? What's the earliest documented use of the word atheism to mean lack of belief in, rather than denial of gods? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-15 22:10:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have recently had a few conversations with theists who have claimed that there is no justification in using atheism in that way, despite it appearing in many dictionary definitions. 
One felt that there is a deliberate plan by 'internet atheists' to change the definition of atheism, to include the agnostic people, and thus to artificially inflate the number of atheists. 

I find that the earliest uses of the word in English (16th century) do seem to imply denial of gods. The oldest sources in the OED do, though the very early origins of the word in Greek seem to start with lack of belief but pick up an implication of denial later. However I am interested in the English usage.  

Anyway, what are the earliest written examples in English of the lack-of-belief definition?

I found George H Smith's [*The Case Against God*](http://www.amazon.com/Atheism-Case-Against-Skeptics-Bookshelf/dp/087975124X/ref=la_B000APQXRY_1_1?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1460748534 sr=1-1) published in 1979 takes that stance, according to [this irritated reviewer.](http://tektonics.org/qt/smithg01.php)

Any earlier? TH Huxley in 1889 seemed so sure of the denial definition only, that he coined the word ['agnostic'](http://atheism.about.com/od/aboutagnosticism/a/huxley.htm) as an alternative. He was a highly educated man, and I think if the lack-of-belief definition was current then, he would have mentioned it.

Lets see if we can have this thread without anyone posting about how atheism is about belief and agnosticism about knowledge...

So, any advance on 1979?

Edit: lots of comments about the value of the matter, not so many early examples of the usage. I have Bertie Russell and Robert Green Ingersoll to check. Any more?

<DATE> 2016-04-10 00:10:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I live in London, where the average road speed is 11mph. The speed limit in some areas is 20mph, and is 30mph as standard (some multi-lane roads are faster).

I wonder why they don't just paint a line down the middle of the lane that autonomous cars can follow? Or something detectable by the car could be buried in the road. Traffic lights could use short-range radio to signal when to stop. Cars could proceed at 20mph on the designated lanes and have radar or ultrasound scanners to detect obstacles, and just stop when any are detected. It would use GPS to navigate, perhaps with RFID devices at forks in the guidance line, to identify the location. The map of lines would be constantly updated by the government when work is required on roads etc. (don't laugh the [TFL website](https://tfl.gov.uk/) and API is really good).

These types of vehicles would need to have the driver there as backup. The driver would go around obstacles, would join the automated line and hand over to the autonomous system . The human driver would start the journey, and park at the end. Perhaps they could doze while moving, and the vehicle sound an alarm to alert them when needed.

I wonder why none of this type of thing seems on Google's mind? They are making it hard for themselves by trying to build a totally autonomous system from the beginning. The type of system I am thinking of would be a relatively cheap add-on to cars. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi /r/badscience mods,
As you probably already know, on December 15 we started running all old deleted accounts through a cleanup process that (among some other things) removed the deleted accounts from subscriber lists. This cleanup process finished running on January 6, and since then I've had a number of mods contact me to ask exactly how many subscribers this caused their subreddits to lose. So I decided to just send out a modmail to everyone that lost at least 100 subscribers to give them that information:
There were 422 old deleted accounts that were still being counted as subscribers in /r/badscience that were removed by the cleanup. Going forward, deleted accounts will automatically be unsubscribed 90 days after the account is deleted.
Please let me know if you have any questions, thanks for all your hard work as always. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also - did he? He introduced *Before the Flood* by talking about the Bootstrap Paradox, and telling the listener to ['google it'.](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Bootstrap+Paradox). (haha - at the time of this posting, that google search [brings up results about this episode of Doctor Who.](http://i.imgur.com/2P4Mdkh.png?1) How wonderfully meta).

Anyway, he apparently speaks to the camera, or audience about Beethoven and his music. This seems a straightforward 'fourth wall' breaking, which, though rare [is not unknown](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Fourth_wall) for The Doctor.

However, at the end of the episode he refers to this speech when talking to Clara. It seems to me that she was the listener at the beginning, not us. We were just seeing Clara's point of view.

What do you think? </TEXT>

I liked the music and meant to research who it was. Now I can't finds the link. I think it was either here or in /r/galifrey, and in the past couple of days. There were two video links close together. I got the impression it was the commenter who made them.

Any ideas what that was? Obviously I have been carefully through my history. </TEXT>
