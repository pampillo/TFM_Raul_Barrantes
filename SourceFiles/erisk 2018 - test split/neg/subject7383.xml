<TEXT> Yeah, each image is a separate book, each block is a chapter, and each vertical line of pixels represents a sentence. Lighter colored pixels correspond to words with more characters. It's probably easier to understand with smaller files like the examples in my github link. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi everyone,

I was wondering if I could get some feedback on a project I made to help teach myself web development. I've never made a website to do anything but display data already on a server before, so this was my first real interactive project. It only uses JavaScript and jQuery for now.

[It's a site to make clippings from a kindle easier to read](https://chemikyle.github.io/authorNotes/). I put up some test data there for use without having to upload your own clippings file.

If anyone has any feedback, or ideas for other features to implement (especially if they'll help me learn new frameworks) I'd be glad to hear them. As of now my only plan is to set up a user account system and parse the JSON file created from input into a SQL database.

I posted it to r/books, but it's already getting downvotes so I don't expect it'll get enough attention to get any feedback there.

Thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I make quite a few highlights while reading in ebooks, but I've found it kind of annoying to sift through the big text document when I'm trying to remember parts of a book. [I've been learning web development and decided to make a website so others could more easily look over their notes.](https://chemikyle.github.io/authorNotes/)  
Upload your `My Clippings` file (located in `Kindle\documents\My Clippings.txt`) and it'll parse it out into a much easier to read format, and let you select which author you want to review your notes on. I stitched together some random selections from my clippings file and put them on the site for a demo, just hit the 'Process file' button and it'll autopopulate with my test data.

It's version 1.0 so please let me know if you have any issues or ideas for new features!

I also have the suite of scripts I used to use before making the site available in my [GitHub](https://github.com/subject7383/authorNotes) if anyone would like to use them (combination of python and shell). </TEXT>

<TITLE> Trying to Recreate Grep-like Functionality in Python </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-17 00:36:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> TOPEDIT: Nevermind, I got it to work myself! (Did not recreate grep's -A/B/C flags in the process though)

Hi everyone,

The short of it:  
I've got sort of a difficult wall I've hit here. Basically I'm trying to scrape the sections I highlight in my kindle and store them in a dict with the keys being: `author_name`, `book_name`, and `the_quote`. I've got adding the author name and the book title down (sort of), but I need to find a way to recreate grep's ability to get the lines after a keyword is found.

I typically [do something like this with a combination of python and shell scripting](https://github.com/subject7383/authorNotes/tree/master/processing_scripts), but I'm trying to turn this collection of scripts into a webapp for learning purposes so I'd like it to be one neat Python file to run in a flask instance or translate it to javascript if need be. The end goal is to dump the final dictionary result into a JSON file for web display purposes, all of which I should be able to learn myself.

The kindle saves a users highlights in a file which is fairly easily parsed:

    Book Title (Author Name)
    - Your Highlight on page n | Location n-m | Added on Day, Month Date, Year H:MM: SS AM/PM
    
    Quote here in single line
    ==========
    Book Title (Author Name)
    - Your Highlight on page n | Location n-m | Added on Day, Month Date, Year H:MM: SS AM/PM
    
    Quote here in single line
    ==========
    Book Title (Author Name)
    - Your Highlight on page n | Location n-m | Added on Day, Month Date, Year H:MM: SS AM/PM
    
    Quote here in single line
    ==========

[I've uploaded a few snippets of a file here, with a decent smattering of authors and books.](http://pastebin.com/nbFhi9XK)  
Luckily the quote is always a single line no matter how it was formatted in the book.

My Code:

    import re
    
    author_regex = re.compile(r'''(
    	\( 					# Open paren
    	([A-Z]\.?\s?)*?		# Allow for first name as all initials, e.g.: F. Scott Fitzgerald, J. K. Rowling, W.E.B. Du Bois
    	([A-Z]				# First letter must be capitalized, apologies to e e cummings,
    						# prevents sentences in parentheses being picked up
    	(\w+\s?))*?			# Rest of the name
    	([A-Z]\.?\s?)*?		# Allow for middle initials if present, e.g.: Philip K. Dick, George R. R. Martin
    	([A-Z]				# Pick up names after middle initial, allowing addl spaces e.g.: Ursala K. Le Guin
    	(\w+\s?))*?
    	\)					# Close paren
    	)''', re.VERBOSE)
    
    list_of_authors = []
    
    # Populate list with authors found via regex
    with open('Sample_My_Clippings.txt', 'r') as f:
    	f = f.read()
    	for i in author_regex.findall(f):
    		i = i[0]
    		clean_name = str(i).replace('(' , '').replace(')', '') # Get rid of the parentheses to store author name properly
    		if clean_name not in list_of_authors:
    			list_of_authors.append(clean_name)
    
    big_dict = {}
    auth_and_book_list = []
    
    for author in list_of_authors:
    	quote_num = 0
    	big_dict[str(author)] = {}
    	with open(notes_filename, 'r+') as f:
    		for line in f:
    			if str(author) in line:
    				big_dict[str(author)]['quote_num' + str(quote_num)] = {}
    				book_name = line.split('(')[0].strip()
    				if (author, book_name) not in auth_and_book_list: #Store author and book name as a tuple, in case I need this for the dict
    					auth_and_book_list.append((author, book_name))
    				big_dict[str(author)]['quote_num' + str(quote_num)].update({
    				'author_name': author,
    				'book_name': book_name,
    				'quote': 'coming soon'
    				})
    				quote_num += 1


This works great for grabbing the author's name and the name of the book (though it overwrites the dictionary entry each time, I'm not so hot at working with dictionaries yet), but I need something like the result of `grep -A 3 author_name` and snatching the last line, perhaps by splitting by `\n` and grabbing the final value. I have a vague idea of using enumerate for this, and increasing the index of a line with a hit by 3 to grab data, but I'm not entirely sure what to do.

Thanks for any help you can offer or link!

E: Got some leeway with the dicts by nesting, code has been updated with better formatting for the dictionary output.  
E2: Going to try splitting by the equals signs and scraping the 0th index for info while using the last index to store the quote  
E3: Above method got it working! Will update my GitHub with code for anyone who comes across this seeking to do the same thing. Unfortunately I didn't manage to recreate grep's -A/-B/-C flags though, so if that was your goal the search continues. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I edited my comment with what I'm pretty sure the actual reason is. Calling an index of an empty list throws an error, breaking the function. So that's why it's using an `and` rather than an `or`.

Your English is perfectly understandable, no need to apologize! Regarding spaces, you'll wanna place it on a new line for it to format properly (if you use RES you can view my formatting directly by using the 'source' option).  
ex:

    def merge(A,B):
        if A !=[] and B !=[]:

<TEXT> As far as I can tell, you use `and` because merging an empty list with a populated one would effectively do nothing, so you make sure that neither list is empty first so the function has an actual effect.

E: Calling any index of an empty list throws an error, that's likely the reason.

Also, you can place 4 spaces before code for better formatting. </TEXT>

Just to clarify, you want an entirely new file with this format:



last_name | first_name | average
---|---|----
Noether | Emmy | 95
Dick | Philip | 85
Curie | Marie | 90

From a file formatted like this:  


last_name | first_name | midterm | final
---|---|----|----
Noether | Emmy | 90 | 100
Dick | Philip | 70 | 100
Curie | Marie | 85 | 95

<TEXT> Oh what he's referring to is a [very real and interesting phenomenon,](https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=132798) I'm just questioning the method of how he's saying it works (just like you are).  
As far as I remember from thermo, impurities in water lower freezing points because it disrupts ice lattices and keeps their formation from being entropically favorable (and raise boiling points by giving the liquids something to adhere to). I'm rusty though.

Also I think you meant supercooled there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not so sure that a nucleation crystal can induce crystallization if the impure sample's freezing point is below the temperature of the ice. It's not just a supercooled solution at that point, that wouldn't be effective.  
E.g. I don't think salt water freezes if you introduce pure water ice shavings.

I'd be pretty excited to be proven wrong though! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok!  
The data is from a cyclic voltammetry experiment. Basically varying the voltage (Y vals) and measuring the current (X vals) flowing through a solution. An example would be starting at 0 volts, sweeping up to 1 volt, then down to -1 volt, and returning to 0. That would be a "run," I isolate them since a molecule may break down and I'd see less of a response on subsequent runs, hence why I they're separated.

The software used to collect data outputs a .csv file, and while I could probably wrangle the data some other way, I'm writing this program for colleagues who also had to spend time working up the data to a usable format but are used to just using something simple like Excel. (Hence why I made the work flow video)

I'll make a top level comment linking sample data in the original format and update tomorrow with examples of how the data is presented. </TEXT>

For the former, depending on your environment when you it will automatically wrap to a new line. Emacs, Vim, and Sublime do this by default.

<TITLE> Splitting a .csv File Into Segments Based on Y-Value </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone,

I'm not sure if this belongs here, but I'm basically looking to automate [this process.](https://youtu.be/rU0EtnfCsc8?t=34s) I already got the header and third column deletion automated fairly easily, but now I'm stuck on how to go about partitioning out the rest of the data into segments as shown in the video.  
I'm thinking using something along the lines of [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4956984/how-do-you-split-a-csv-file-into-evenly-sized-chunks-in-python), but I don't know how to go about having it automatically find that initial Y value and use that for the number of lines to cut and paste.  
Perhaps [in the last for loop](https://github.com/subject7383/Princeton-Applied-Research-M250-270-electrochemistry-data-cleaner/blob/master/cleanCloner.py) something like this can split the data inline, but from there I still don't know how to line them up in separate columns.  
    
    if row[1] == starting_value:  
        outFile.write('\n')

Thanks for any help you can offer! </TEXT>

<TEXT> His poetry is alright, but I don't really like his novels.  
As you noticed and as someone else mentioned the prose is simple and it's easy to get through (that's not a bad thing in itself), but upon finishing it felt like I'd wasted my time, there's usually a few decent statements about drudgery but the characters feel like they don't develop, so reading the book itself feels like a sisyphusian effort. The backdrops shift but the characters don't, they keep doing the same things in different places; the book ends and all you can imagine is that he goes off and finds another shit job with another shit boss, and another woman to complain about, rinse and repeat until death.

What really left a bad taste in my mouth was that he comes off as kind of a self important asshole and it detracts from the message. It feels more like he's bragging at a bar rather than painting a story. Which, I suppose is his allure, but it's not my thing. </TEXT>

God damn it, you've got to be kind."*

Edit: Seeing this one already mentioned, along with my other favorite short quotes, I shuffled through my notes on Galapagos and found this:

*There was still plenty of food and fuel and so on for all the human beings on the planet, as numerous as they had become, but millions upon millions of them were starting to starve to death now. The healthiest of them could go without food for only about forty days, and then death would come.  
And this famine was as purely a product of oversize brains as Beethovens Ninth Symphony.  
It was all in peoples heads. People had simply changed their opinions of paper wealth, but, for all practical purposes, the planet might as well have been knocked out of orbit by a meteor the size of Luxembourg.* </TEXT>

<TITLE> Crontab Failing Specific Python Script </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-05 23:33:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone,

I have a [python script](https://github.com/subject7383/jazzyWeather) I'm trying to get to run with crontab, but it isn't working; although it works just fine by other methods.


My script is meant to produce some text and play an mp3 file, but the file doesn't play. I thought it was just some issue with sound output, but setting cron to output a .log file *does* create a file, but it comes up empty though it should at least create text. Even stranger, commenting out the portion that plays the song still leaves me with an empty log file.    
I tried making a separate .sh script that runs the python script when called, but unfortunately that didn't solve my problem either.  

I then tried making a generic script that just prints "Hello, world" and that one worked fine with cron, I'm slowly trying out different combinations of the modules used to see what's failing, but they're working for me after trying a few, even the vlc one for music!

I figure this might be an issue somebody has run into before, but I can't find it online.

Here is the latest cronjob:

    * * * * * /usr/bin/python /home/kyle/path/to/script.py  /home/kyle/out.log

If you want to try the full program, generic .json data can be generated [here](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d=data/forecast) rather than waiting for API approval.

Thanks in advance for any help! </TEXT>

I'd say what you described is learning and understanding, but staring at a page that says "ketone + Grignard = alcohol" until it's burned into your brain is memorizing. Understanding would be knowing the nucleophilic nature of Grignard reagents, and electrophilic nature of ketones.  
If you were given a problem where your molecule had both a ketone and a protic group somewhere in it, or protic solvent, you'd know the reaction wouldn't work because the proton would quench your Grignard, but student A who memorized it would just see the pieces they remembered and get the answer wrong. </TEXT>

After commenting that Daisy and Tom are careless, Nick literally says speaking to Tom is like speaking to a child, appeased by handshakes and pricey baubles.  
The closing line (to me) is basically chastising Gatsby for chasing a receding shoreline, the useless pursuit of Daisy as she had been in the past; earlier in the book he says that Gatsby is pursuing Daisy as a way to recover a part of himself that he had lost. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just emailed professors at my school whose research I found interesting for my first lab; then honed my interests there and attended a chem club meeting where a few professors talked about their research. I hadn't done very well in courses my first semester, but my a chem professor vouched for me to start in the lab I went to after genetics; getting to know your professors and asking questions would probably be a good idea. They'll also be able to provide better rec letters later on if they actually know you.

As for internships (which is what ChemE's aim for afaik) I'm not sure since I've never been too industrially minded, but your school would probably have a career resource center who might be able to help since that's a big thing for all engineers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Strange! I have similar stats; but I'm not doing straight organic anymore. I also emailed professors to ask about their research prior and applied really early so that probably helped a bit.  
During the visit weekends the people that spoke to us mentioned that they haven't found GPA or GRE to be indicative of success at all, since they've had 4.0s fail out and 3.0s do extremely well.

You might have an easier time with it after working and growing up a bit anyway.

<TEXT> If you've had prior experience with physics   MV/vector calculus I wouldn't sweat it too much.  
I had OChem II + lab, Physics I + lab (without any prior studying of physics), Calc III(MV), and DiffEq one semester along with research and a board position in the chem club. It was really stressful, but manageable as long as things are scheduled properly and you get enough sleep and exercise/relaxation time in between.

It's student/school dependent, but I thought AChem was simple but meticulous; I didn't like the class because I thought it was boring moreso than difficult. Seems like you're ChemE though, so you'll probably think differently of it.

Also, pairing inorganic with PChem II (which I assume is QM) is a pretty good idea, since they both cover very similar concepts (and they're really fun).

General advice:  
Don't be scared of things just because you hear they're hard. When you focus on the material itself rather than what's said about you'll have a much easier time with it.  
Get into a research lab as early as you can! Don't worry about not knowing enough, they won't expect you to off the bat; you're there to learn and they know that. Go for whatever you think sounds like might be cool, it's ok to switch labs (I did genetics for 6 months before switching to OChem, now I'm going to grad school for PChem).  
**Research experience and letters of rec are what gets you into grad school, not your GPA.** Don't go getting straight C's, but if you find you hate AChem, don't be afraid to take a B to flesh out your research exp.  
Don't sell yourself short on your learning abilities, but don't overload yourself either. It'd probably be better to take an extra year to spread it out rather than burn out. Wrt that, get a hobby or two; no matter how much you love chem you'll need a break once in a while. Setting down your homework for an hour to go for a hike/swim/bike ride/knitting club and coming back to it fresh could help you see a way to finish a problem you were stuck on.

Most of all, have fun with it! </TEXT>

I'm not entirely sure how to go about that though; if it helps, this is how I import data to plot.

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    
    data = np.genfromtxt("D:\\Users\\eggs\\spam\\fileToPlot.csv", delimiter=',', names=['x', 'y'])
    
    fig = plt.figure()

    ax1.set_title("")    
    ax1.set_xlabel('Voltage (V)')
    ax1.set_ylabel('Current (A)')
    
    plt.show()

I'm thinking there may be some way to do something along the lines of this to plot one point at a time?
 
    n=1
    while n  #number of points:
        x=data[:n,0]
        y=data[:n,1]

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone,

I'm using Python 3.4 and the most recent Anaconda distribution of SciPy (i.e. using matplotlib for plotting).

I'm trying to make an animated plot that traces out my data from either a .csv or .xlsx file (trying to show colleagues how data will appear when running an experiment), but all of the documentation I'm pulling up is on animating functions or random data.  
Could somebody please help me out/point me in the right direction?

Here's the closest example I've found, but it's an animation of random data:

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib.animation as animation
    
    def update_line(num, data, line):
        line.set_data(data[...,:num])
        return line,
    
    fig1 = plt.figure()
    
    data = np.random.rand(2, 25)
    l, = plt.plot([], [], 'r-')
    plt.xlim(0, 1)
    plt.ylim(0, 1)
    plt.xlabel('x')
    plt.title('test')
    line_ani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig1, update_line, 25, fargs=(data, l),
        interval=50, blit=True)

Thanks! </TEXT>

Pure water has a really high resistance (18.2 M), but basically every bit of water you come across will have salts dissolved in it; the dissociated ions carry the charge and allow current to pass through.

Their "cold" fructose is stuck in a particular conformation as there isn't enough thermal energy to overcome the barrier of rotation for a particular/series of bonds in the compound. While cold, it's locked in one conformation which can only interact with one or a set of taste receptors.  
When it heats up enough, it can overcome the barrier of rotation and new conformation become accessible; it spends a portion of its time in a conformation that's able to interact with different taste receptors. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Using two monitors with built in speakers as independent left/right stereo speakers </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-18 00:21:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi,

I just got 2 new monitors which have built in speakers, they're flanking a central monitor and I'd like to set each one to output left/right sound only, I figured this may be confusing, so here's [this diagram to help out a bit.] (http://imgur.com/GnRqiSD) What I want is for the left and right monitors to act as separate stereo speakers, "left" sound would play through LL and LR, and "right" sound would play through RL and RR.  
I have a general idea of how I could do this using cables and splitters, but I'd rather just use what I have.

* Windows 8.1  
* MOBO integrated sound (X99 chipset)
* Monitors connected digitally to graphics card (GTX 760)
* One monitor connected via HDMI, other via DisplayPort (both to graphics card)

I tried using Virtual Audio Cable; although I could get both monitors to output audio simultaneously, I couldn't get it to separate properly.

Thanks for any help!

PS: I'm aware buying separate speakers would produce better sound quality, but I can't justify the cost of an entertainment-only buy.

EDIT: Added diagram to ease understanding

EDIT2: To anyone with the same question, it looks like it's not possible via software alone; /u/Feltz- offered an easy physical alternative below. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Buying Advice: Acer V236HL or Asus vS238H-P </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-09 10:35:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone,

I'm in the market to buy 2 1080p monitors to flank my Acer H236HL. I needed them to be 23 inches, VESA mountable, and $150 each; I have it narrowed down to 2 monitors:

Acer V236HL  
or  
Asus VS238H-P


Use:  
I'll be doing a bit of document/infographic design with InDesign (not professionally, so I don't need 99% Adobe color space), viewing multiple scientific articles (double column format), writing word docs and plotting data, but most importantly, triple monitor gaming (GTX 760 w/ 4G VRAM, mostly RPGs); I imagine I'll be switching them between portrait and landscape regularly while procrastinating on my thesis.


Does anyone have any advice on which of these two (or any others) I should go with, or suggestions for easily pivotable VESA mount arms?

Edit: On the off chance anyone stumbles across this and is curious, I ended up not getting either since I didn't realize they were both TN panels.  
I went with an Asus PB238Q. </TEXT>

<TEXT> /r/buildmeapc would be very helpful if you have a general idea.

Things seem to be on the cusp of a change for hardware.  
Someone else mentioned monitors and waiting on buying 4K, I agree with him; I'd buy a 1080 or 1440 screen for now and plunge for 4K when DisplayPort 1.3 and HDMI 2.0 hit and G-Sync/FreeSync are more common and there are more with IPS $800 (which would mean maybe saving a bit of money on a GPU, getting a 780 or 970 now and spending the extra money on more monitors).

NVidia's Pascal architecture will be coming out sometime next year and I suppose 4K gaming will be commonplace then, you could possibly even do multi-4K displays on just one card ([right now it takes 3 980s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt5oE0gpnnk)). </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, I'm not; don't be condescending.

What I was building to was an example where two viewpoints could be represented. Take this case where [an artist had a disagreement with the record company publishing their album,] (http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1083961/streetlight-manifesto-flips-off-victory-records-to-release-acoustic) there are three parties to consider: a fan who pirates the album, the band themselves, and the record company.

1. The fans' act of pirating the data (the album), according to your guidelines is morally reprehensible as it takes away *their* money. "Them" is ill-defined, but since the counter-argument often defines "them" as the artists, we'll look at their case next.
2. The band members themselves, the creators of the data: in this instance, the producers of the data are at odds with the publishers regarding the withholding of revenue (whether they are entitled to revenue from this data, and how much, is an entirely separate argument). They *advocated* fans pirating their album or buy it directly from them. From their standpoint, fans pirating is a positive, as it lessens the hold that the publisher held on them; the fan would be stealing from thieves. Regardless of the reason for the fans' piracy and the dispute itself, no loss of revenue would be incurred due to the creators of the data, this is morally neutral to the creators, as per your rules. 
3. The record company: the publishing corporation obviously considers fans pirating as a negative, as it "takes away" their capital.

Shades of grey don't only apply to the well-used example of "a man's wife is dying, money is sparse, does he steal the medicine?"

Different parties are affected in different ways, and view the act in different lights. </TEXT>

That's what those fancy supercomputers that do my work wish they ran on. I actually have an old server board with some impressive stuff for its time (2 dual-core xeons and 32GB of RAM, even if it is all DDR2); hang around loading docks of your local university and you might find some people throwing that out in 10 years or so!

Anyway looks like I'm all set then, I'll go with the X99 build. Thanks again! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think workstation GPUs are for professional photo editing or SolidWorks for engineers; the closest I get to really intensive GPU related calculations in my work would be pre-optimizing things showing some spheres move around while the CPU finds coordinates so I can send them to a supercomputer. I can do that with my laptop now, but trying to do data analysis in Excel makes it freeze up (plotting ~10^4 ordered pairs). I'm not looking to have future-proof components initially (so I won't be starting out with quad SLI 980s), but lay a solid foundation for what would evolve into a hardcore computer in a few years (e.g. by the time the Pascal GPUs come out and cost around what a 980 does now I'd be willing/able to drop the cash to SLI *those*).

It's really approaching 2 rigs at once I guess. Initially it would be a moderately good machine; as a reach scenario, an ideal starting rig would be capable of running a 1440p ultra-wide center monitor with 2 flanking 1080p monitors, able to combine them in eyefinity and play Tomb Raider on max settings with 30 fps. Plotting data sets as large as those that crash Excel for me, but with 3 dimensions and then being able to adjust it with no stutter, maybe while I have a couple tabs open in Chrome. 

Down the line something powerful that currently just can't be done without bleeding edge hardware (which is why I brought up GPUs and CPUs still in development). I'd also like a CPU capable of handling compiling code, plotting data, and making a lecture in powerpoint all at the same time across all those high resolution screens. More logical cores would probably be useful than clock speed. The "reach" scenario for the end system would something crazy like triple monitor 1440p for gaming while game stats/internet browser display on the portrait 1080p **and** a movie plays on the 4K TV. Though all that is a combination of CPU, GPU, and RAM. Although that would probably still melt a hole in my desk within a minute.

I figured when you said the X99 chipset could handle more bandwidth that'd be good for doing more things at once down the line, and having enough PCI ports to throw fancy GPUs at it would certainly help the unrealistic goals. Though that might require an entirely new mobo by that point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I found a (base) setup with an X99 mobo since you seemed adamant about it; I'm taking a hit on the CPU on both power consumption and clock speed, with the idea that I can upgrade it to something better once broadwells come out and the price for haswell drops. Half the RAM (but it's DDR4) and SSD space (not a big deal, since I'll just be putting an OS on it). GPUs are cutback for both, but I've been gaming on integrated laptop graphics and the focus isn't games anyway.

Both fall nicely enough below my starting price range that I could build them as early as January and either path would be a huge upgrade; which setup would go best with my end-goal? I'm willing to spend an additional $5,000 on *upgrades* beyond the initial rig.

Also thanks for all the help! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah, see that's where the "very little knowledge" part comes in; I know next to nothing about mobos. That was just referencing the CPU, which I intend to upgrade to something broadwell based for the final build (so I'm vaguely aware I need a Z97 chipset, and I need to be able to stuff in minimum 2 GPUs to SLI until Pascal saves us all(?)). I may also go with 1 wide center monitor and flank it with portraits so it'd be 4 monitors in the endgame.

What little I'm aware of is just a result of working with stuff related to semiconductors. AFAIK my laptop with an i5-337U can handle my undergrad homework so higher numbers will do graduate level work. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Multi-Year Build Plan for Computational Work   Play </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-20 17:13:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

Some computational chemistry work (i.e. black box calculations, light programming, using terminal to tell supercomputers what to do), some gaming, presentations, documents and a little image editing.

* CPU centered programs: LaTeX (will utilize live document preview, possibly via EMACS), Python, GnuPlot and/or Origin, Avogadro (molecular modeling program, fairly lightweight), Mathematica, MATLAB.
* GPU: GIMP, Tomb Raider, Portal, Skyrim, 5 monitors for multi-tasking (triple monitor NVIDIA Surround for gaming).

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* ~$1,500-$2,000 for initial build; capable
* Add ~$5,000 for upgrades to reach final form; no-holds-barred, hit me with all the sexy future tech coming in the next couple years

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

* Initial, functional build: Mid-summer/fall 2015; OK to use current stuff if you have anything in mind.
* End-date: ~Winter 2016 

This means NVIDIA's new Maxwell microarchitecture will be settled and Pascal will be coming out; I'm willing to skimp on the initial setup to splurge for Pascal based components when they become available since it seems like that's going to be a huge improvement.

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

* Tower
* Monitors (included sketch at bottom).
* Initial build GPU.

**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* US; A few possible places, most pertinent to computer parts: Chicago, IL; Berkeley/Pasadena, CA

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

* None, fresh build.

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* Down the line, *maybe*; may entertain possibility of 2 CPU slots on the mobo, but likely won't need since I'm aiming for an i7 4000 series. I'll have access to supercomputers for all the really heavy stuff.

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* SSD for OS, possibly 2, one for Windows and one for a Linux distro (not necessary unless cheap or dual-booting is made difficult by Windows 8+). OK with a hard drive for everything else.
* Mobo capable of SLI.
* May require a workstation GPU or one that can be "unlocked." But none of the programs are as intense as those engineers use.

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* Relatively minimalist, large tower would be nice; aesthetics fairly unimportant, just want airflow.
* Water cooling seems more aesthetic, but I'll be running computations, not just gaming.

**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

* No, but would like opinions on dual-booting Windows and Linux from one drive (I hear this has been made somewhat difficult due to BIOS changes).

**Extra info or particulars:**

I'd like to start off with two monitors (one for portrait), but end with 5; [I drew a sketch with arrangement, sizes, and resolution.] (http://i.imgur.com/BWFg84c.jpg?1) Idea is to use the main triple monitor for gaming (Not willing to use one super-ultrawide-curved screen, need to stay triple for easy windows snapping when doing work; willing to debezel), portrait for easier interaction with documents/talking to terminal, big TV for movies and for putting up plots or reference documents (hence the 4K).

If anyone has any input on how easy workflow would be please chime in!

Since I'm looking far into the future for the end-product and I've obviously outlined a lot of stuff with very little knowledge, I'm kinda just looking for a general direction to look in. Feel free to cherry-pick what to answer.

Thanks for any advice you can give! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I took the GRE today and did fairly poorly [159 V (81%), 157 Q (68%)], likely because I studied for all of 2 days and loathe basic statistics.

While the verbal is past the point of mattering, the quantitative is only in the 60th percentile for chem majors and I'm applying to highly regarded PChem programs. However, I have a minor in math and a 3.9 GPA for that coursework; will being able to do real math offset the GRE score to adcoms or is there a sieve in place that I won't get through?

I know the GRE is often insulted as a metric for graduate ability, but is it an auto-cutoff like GPA?

Update for people from the future: I didn't retake it and had no issues getting accepted! </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I may not have the most authority on the matter, as I'm also a senior undergrad biting my nails over Ph.D. programs, at least I'm in the thick of the stress with you.

You're going to have to come terms with knowing you most likely won't make it through the sieve for applications to most schools, as /u/radiatorcheese said. No matter how good the rest of your app is, places with a high volume of applicants have to do some kind of pre-screening and the easiest metric is a 3.0 GPA cutoff (official or unofficial). However, to the places that won't do that your research and teaching experience will be a huge boon to the adcoms, especially since you'll be applying to lesser-known schools where many students may not have any research at all (and apparently pubs are really rare)!

However, at the risk of being rude, while a C+ in a couple classes seems somewhat dismissable (had a bad semester or absolutely despised the material in a class and you're not applying to do something related to it), having that in every class suggests you have trouble grasping the material or are unmotivated. I would think it will look very strange that you were a TA with that kind of record, and you may be looked at a bit skeptically (this is where your letters come into play).

Try to go to a conference if you can and talk to some professors. Blow your GREs out of the water, get that paper published and you'll have some solid counterweights to the GPA. You won't be going to any big names like Berkeley or MIT, but I think you could find a program somewhere, if you *really* want to do chemistry. Maybe discuss doing a Ph.D. at your current institution with your professors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As some others have stated, an entire math *major* is a stretch, but the more you know, the better. Barebones, you'll need the calculus sequence. As part of your later coursework, you'll also need to know some differential equations (thermo PChem) and linear algebra (quantum PChem   inorganic); those will likely be covered in your classes, but stuff like symmetry will be way easier to understand with some mathematical understanding of things like group theory.

In the mean time, you can relax and take your time on learning, you probably won't need any math for your organic sequence, and AChem is mostly just the same boring statistics from high school with the occasional atom (sorry if I offend anyone here), so you're looking at another 2 years to flesh out your mathematical prowess.

Also, don't worry about your pre-calc score, I barely scraped a B in that class and thought I was terrible at math too; once I got into calc II I found out I not only could handle it, but it was fun! I added a math minor and have a 3.9 GPA on the required courses (humble-brag mitigated by admitting that I would still totally fail a pre-calc exam). Most of the stuff required for a second major would probably be terribly boring for a physical scientist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're both right overall, and Heisenberg *is* attributed to that concept, along with Bohr; I think Heisenberg's original idea was that a waveform exists as a distribution of all states being simultaneously "true," until measured (as detailed in the wiki on the Copenhagen interpretation), which is what Schrdinger was calling absurd. Though I guess I was going off of what everyday people think of when they hear Schrdinger (the cat) and Heisenberg (momentum and time uncertainty). Nobody's wrong as far as the science is concerned, but you'd be right-er I suppose?

Either way, don't feel bad; I wasn't really trying to call out anyone, just trying to shoehorn in QM info since it's all really cool stuff.

I'm being given a student card and I got a NetID, so I guess I'm effectively a student so that shouldn't be a problem. I've been climbing off and on for about 2 years but I'm not great (V4-   5.9/5.10, haven't climbed since January) and only in it for the fun, but I'd still be up for pms for pairups (my belay skills are on point; I could pull rope on a 5.15 as long as you're top-roping). I mainly boulder so I'd probably be hang dogging on anything over 5.9.

I'm there with a program so if I were to snake away for a weekend I think it might have to be open to 13 other people with likely 0 climbing experience and no transportation (so I'll look into the outing club). My shoes smell horrible (yay, Evolv!) so I'll put them in a plastic bag or use this opportunity to buy new ones. </TEXT>

* Is the atmosphere "get good at climbing" or "have a good time climbing?"
* Is there a long wait for routes to open up during the summer?

<TEXT> This isn't data from a real reaction and there's no defined SM; we made it up for proof of concept linked to (what we thought was) a fun compound. As for the energy differences, we attribute those to sterics; compound B is the Z isomer, whereas compound A is E. 

As for the actual concept of thermo vs. kinetic, the kinetic product is whatever forms fastest (i.e. has the lowest transition state (TS) energy: smallest G) and the thermodynamic product is whichever has the most stable end product (i.e. biggest change in G: largest |G|).

[Here's an arbitrarily chosen graph showing the TS energy and final product.] (http://imgur.com/iKVG3dJ)

So in our made up reaction, there are two pathways the compound can go through ([see original exam question] (http://imgur.com/BTUldyx)). One pathway has a lower TS, but a smaller |G|, so it happens quicker due to its lower energy barrier (the TS); the other has a higher TS, and requires more energy, but results in a more stable product (largest |G|), and is therefore the thermodynamic product (as determined by the |G|).

Hope that helped! (Though you probably already understood everything past the first 2 sentences, that was a knee-jerk response to try to explain everything I guess.)

Email the graduate students of groups you are interested in for graduate study and ask them what they think of the group. If you've already been accepted and are going on visitations, seek out the disgruntled students that they aren't putting on display and ask them their opinions.

<TEXT> I'm not a business man, but back in high school my algebra teacher told me I was stupid and would never answer any questions I had, this lead to me struggling later in precalculus since I'd never properly learned algebra and subsequently avoided calculus since I was "too stupid for it." I was scared as hell to take it in college.

I'm in my 3rd year of college now and I'm minoring in mathematics and have a 3.9 GPA in it; everything is easy, the calculus sequence, diffEQ, and linear algebra were all a breeze.

I think this applies to everything, not just science; it's all about perspective and perseverance, just because you can't do something in high school doesn't mean you're not smart enough. There is more than one way to do/think about things and some ways work better than others, but early experiences may try to force one way or another on you. On some level it may just be buckling down and actually doing the work, but it might be that things aren't being though of in the right way.

It may also be worth noting I got a B- in general chemistry, and now I'm going to be spending my summer doing research at Cornell; don't give up on something if it interests you! Give it your best and that's all you can ask of yourself. </TEXT>

I'm a chemistry student minoring in math and physics, most laymen seem to think that this means I can rattle off obscure multiplications and do basic algebra in my head rapidly; I still count on my fingers for the elementary level stuff and have to sit down and write out precalculus problems.

Just because you're bad at high school math doesn't mean you're not smart or can't do real mathematics! There are so many more ways to think about things than what they force-feed you in compulsory school. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good luck! I loved OChem (obviously) so much that I'm TA'ing it.

Just a few tips, since everyone seems so terrified of it:

* learn to see the patterns; trying to memorize only makes it harder than it needs to be.

* carbon is not pentavalent.

* get a modeling kit if you can't/until you're able to think in 3D.

* get ChemDraw to name things for you. IUPAC is the worst. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems like graduate courses are much more reading and independent work than an undergrad course. This is pretty ubiquitous among the science departments here and isn't limited to chemistry.

My university offers a few courses that are split between grad and undergrad; I'm in the biochem class right now and it's totally manageable. We also have a 2 credit polymer course which I've heard very good things about, the students learn a lot and it doesn't feel like a burden at all.

You may want to try *auditing* it to give it a test run; I've done that with all my grad classes (they make us pay 3x the price for them, and they don't accept ramen noodles as payment) and it's saved me from committing myself to some courses that turned out to be quite boring review of what I already knew. </TEXT>

Contact some of the professors and ask to see the syllabus and tentative course load. I hear the first grad OChem course is about 1/2 undergrad review, at least at my school.

This past semester I took: Honor's OChem II and lab, MV calc, DiffEQ, Physics I and lab, along with ~10 hrs/wk in a research lab, leadership in student ACS, and tutored some friends in OChem. I won't call it easy, but it wasn't as hard as other people thought it would be, and I definitely wouldn't consider myself exceptional; I had a reasonable amount of free time despite MV calc being more work than it was supposed to be and having no experience with physics prior (and I think kinematics is sleep inducing). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've done all of those but linear, which I'll take in the fall; my school names things differently, linear and diffEQ are separate courses (diffEQ is actually 2 courses), and calc 3 is MV calc.

In my experience, calc 2 was so much fun it made me declare a mathematics minor.

Calc 3 (multivariable) was said to be a "reward for getting through calc 2." Maybe it was because the math department here is bleeding money, but we had an over the top course load, the course admin didn't seem to understand what constitutes "too much work," the material is fairly easy to grasp if you can conceptualize everything and imagine the graphs. Get cozy with integrations.

DiffEQ was...boring, despite having a very smart and funny professor, but that's the nature of the course, it was far easier than calc 2, I had it the same semester as MV calc, and it took significantly less time. It had some degree of memorization, which always sucks, but wasn't too bad. </TEXT>

I had declared a math minor and adding a physics degree makes that minor more applicable, going into courses already knowing the math from an actual mathematics department course is hugely beneficial.

I do know a girl who decided to add physics as a second major, the advisors didn't actually file her application so that caused a slew of difficulties (but my university is known for trying to push people out to keep the 4 year graduation rate looking pretty in the statistics).

She said to file for it as early as possible, and make sure that the administration gets it filed.

As far as coursework, she told me there was tons of overlap and having both actually made classes somewhat easier. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fiancepeas is right.
Chemistry major weed outs vary by institution, I believe at my school it's instrumental analysis. OChem is the typical premed weed-out but it does trip up some chemists; Dr. David Klein's books are phenomenal for this class and I recommend it to people I don't have time to tutor.

I'm in a QM and spec (PChem 2) course now and the nature of the course is so unorthodox the professor is having us write our own exams (but there are only 7 of us). If you took AP chem you should be able to handle the gen chems, maybe skip the first.

I actually started off in neurogenetics lab doing protein purifications my freshman year, the project stalled and I went to a physical organic lab. For both labs I just emailed the PhD in charge and said I was interested in their research and wanted to know if they had any room for an undergrad; you may or may not be asked to interview, they won't expect you to know their stuff in and out (especially early on), but it'd be safe to glance over a couple publications to get an idea.

Professors have different expectations and quirks, there's no real finite science to getting a position; just get an idea of what you're interested in and ask about it, some will want you to have course experience, some won't, but typically starting early gets you some wiggle room on expectations since you have potential to stay on for all 4 years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started off as an English and Psychology double major just drifting through taking whatever I felt like, but always found chemistry interesting; my first semester I took general chem 1 and got a B-, two short years later and I'm about a month away from authorship on an upcoming publication, president of the chemistry club, and my retiring professor is offering me a job tutoring OChem and calculus for him at his new business (plus a few other accolades but I'm not trying to be a braggart, just make a point).

My advice would be don't get discouraged by "weed-out" courses; if you stumble, pick yourself up and keep going, you never know what you might accomplish. Don't stray from the "enhanced" or "honors" designated courses; in my experience, these classes are easier due to smaller size and more enthusiastic professors.

Also, don't think that just because you like it on paper you'll like it in lab (and start research ASAP!); bench chemistry can be extremely frustrating and arduous, but, if you really love it you'll just find yourself keeping at it. </TEXT>
