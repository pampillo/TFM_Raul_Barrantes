<TEXT>   Googling Kotaku pageviews gives a site that suggests 1.2m at a peak of unique visitors. For the entire site.

That sucks because Kotaku produces a lot more interesting content than TotalBiscuit. TB will rant for a looong time about settings and one specific game. I've personally grown tired of youtube personalities in general. The good ones are reading from a script that would take a fraction of the time to read if it were an article.

Kotaku produces a bunch of articles every day and once in a while they have really in depth ones that are totally original reporting. They're a lot more important to the games scene in general than youtubers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 

Deforestation continues across the tropics at alarming rates, with repercussions for ecosystem processes, carbon storage and long term sustainability. Taking advantage of recent fine-scale measurement of deforestation, this analysis aims to improve our understanding of the scale of deforestation drivers in the tropics. We examined trends in forest clearings of different sizes from 20002012 by country, region and development level. As tropical deforestation increased from approximately 6900 kha yr1 in the first half of the study period, to 7900 kha yr1 in the second half of the study period, 50% of this increase was attributable to the proliferation of medium and large clearings (10 ha). This trend was most pronounced in Southeast Asia and in South America. Outside of Brazil 60% of the observed increase in deforestation in South America was due to an upsurge in medium- and large-scale clearings; Brazil had a divergent trend of decreasing deforestation, 90% of which was attributable to a reduction in medium and large clearings. The emerging prominence of large-scale drivers of forest loss in many regions and countries suggests the growing need for policy interventions which target industrial-scale agricultural commodity producers. The experience in Brazil suggests that there are promising policy solutions to mitigate large-scale deforestation, but that these policy initiatives do not adequately address small-scale drivers. By providing up-to-date and spatially explicit information on the scale of deforestation, and the trends in these patterns over time, this study contributes valuable information for monitoring, and designing effective interventions to address deforestation.

This is may be the most interesting part: 

"This lead to the creation of what is the most well-known example of a cycle-accurate emulator: higan (formerly bsnes). It is legendarily accurate, but also infamously slow. This is in part due to the fact that it is cycle accurate. It uses co-routines to switch between portions of the emulation as needed, which has a lot of overhead. Because higan is the best-known example of a cycle-accurate emulator, it has led to the misconception that cycle accuracy is necessarily extremely slow. However, much of higans performance issues are because the emulation is not optimized for speed. This was an intentional decision on byuus part to make sure that the code is ultimately readable and understandable, as byuu maintains a strict code as documentation policy. Beyond being a means to play SNES games, byuu treats higan as a preservation project and documentation on the behavior of the SNES itself. It is possible to make a highly optimized and accurate SNES emulator that would be significantly faster than higan without sacrificing much accuracy; however, no one has done this. Its quite a daunting task, after all."

<TEXT> It's always easier to predict something after it had happened. It seems obvious now that the WiiU would do badly because it has. But could you have predicted that before launch? The Switch didn't get more marketing than the WiiU. 

As for the name, they probably did some market research and found that customers preferred the name WiiU because it was more familiar. As /u/SegataSanshiro said Apple hasn't had any problems naming all of its products by the same name. Microsoft also has many Surface laptops and Xbox consoles; cars keep the same names over multiple generations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> True. The problem with the infinite sidequests is that they change the way the game is played. Instead of trusting the DM (the game) to lead you along an interesting adventure, you have to choose to stop doing sidequests because there are too many and they're bad.

<TEXT> We just got used to it. I found a [thread from 2006 discussing the issue](https://slashdot.org/story/06/04/04/165210/frustration-with-oblivion-mod-costs-on-xbox-live):

"So much for the good old days where this kind of content was free. I would never even imagined I would have to pay for this sort of thing.

I can expect to pay something for a substantial mod that introduces a new storyline or something to that effect. But to be charged for something as simple as a new texture and maybe a new model is pathetic."

"Micro$oft's marketing droids have fired the first salvo in the latest round of Digital Restrictions Management Warfare. Oblivion, by Bethesda, widely believed to be the strongest candidate for 2006 Game Of The Year, has begun providing downloadable content via XBOX Live. This could be great news, but at roughly $2.50 for downloadable Horse Armor a mere two weeks after the game shipped, we all know this was carved from the game to be sold separately. Bethesda is also to blame here, with other similarly priced content on the way. How long until "essential" game content is withheld from a game release, only to be downloaded in Pay-Per-Play chunks?

Please note that I'm definitely not against pay-per-play as a viable model, however, for these guys to charge $2.50 for what basically amounts to a few texture maps and a mesh is a big step over the edge onto a slippery slope that could (will?) lead to more egregious violations of player trust. And, before everyone says "if you don't like it, don't buy it"...believe me, I won't. However, it's important to understand that without public backlash over this, the folks behind these machinations will continue forward, "innovating" online gaming to the point where you won't be able to complete a $60 game you purchased until you've spent another $40 on pseudo-essential add-ons. (Not picking on you, Bethesda, we love you guys!!!)"

"
You're going to see a lot of developers holding back content so they can make you pay more through XBox Live. Here's hoping Nintendo and Sony take full advantage of the mistakes that are being made with Live. This is a great example of what *not* to do with an online service. Micropayments will be their downfall."

"
It's really mind-boggling that Bethesda thinks it's okay to sell a CD full of actual content for $50-70, and still thinking it's okay to sell a couple of extra skins for $1.99-$2.50.

Why didn't they follow the same pricing model when selling their game? Surely if 2 skins are worth $2.50, then an entire CD filled with thousands of skins, logic, sprawling maps, etc would be worth several thousands of dollars per disc.

Bethesda should be ashamed."

To be fair, there were many moderating voices: 
"
I honestly don't see why everyone is freaking out about this; message boards seem to have exploded in rage all over the internet since yesterday, and it's really not that big a deal. I don't feel like $2.50 is worth a mod that doesn't actually do anything (the "armor" doesn't actually increase the horse's armor class, it just makes it look nice), and I feel like a lot of people are thinking the same thing. When Bethesda finds out that people aren't willing to pay that amount for so little, I'm guessing that future content will be priced more in line with the value it gives players. All in all, this really has nothing to do with Microsoft or how horrible the 360 is, but with why Bethesda chose that price for this particular content."

That last part turned out to be horribly wrong. On the contrary, developers have found that gamers are willing to pay much MORE than $2,50 for cosmetics.

<TEXT> Yes, his name is Drew Karpyshyn and here is [the interview](http://www.pcgamer.com/mass-effect-3-series-former-lead-writer-reveals-original-ending-ideas/)

"Dark Energy was something that only organics could access because of various techno-science magic reasons we hadn't decided on yet. Maybe using this Dark Energy was having a ripple effect on the space-time continuum.

"Maybe the Reapers kept wiping out organic life because organics keep evolving to the state where they would use biotics and dark energy and that caused an entropic effect that would hasten the end of the universe. Being immortal beings, that's something they wouldn't want to see.

"Then we thought, let's take it to the next level. Maybe the Reapers are looking at a way to stop this. Maybe there's an inevitable descent into the opposite of the Big Bang (the Big Crunch) and the Reapers realise that the only way they can stop it is by using biotics, but since they can't use biotics they have to keep rebuilding society - as they try and find the perfect group to use biotics for this purpose. The asari were close but they weren't quite right, the Protheans were close as well.

"Again it's very vague and not fleshed out, it was something we considered but we ended up going in a different direction." </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I'd love to play a Western RPG set in an American High School. 

There are few Western games set in a High School or with HS aged characters (there was Bully, but I can't recall anything else). Videogame heroes are usually in their late 20s or early 30s. I think that a HS setting would not really have broad appeal, like it seems to have in Japan. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd be worried about bankruptcy law getting in the way. Once a company is bankrupt it can't do anything it wants. IANAL, but if removing the DRM destroys billions of dollars of value for the creditors, this could potentially be illegal. Wouldn't it be a wilful destruction of property?

I doubt that once the lawyers kick in they'll greenlight the removal of DRM, but I may be wrong. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I don't think that Steam Support is even the same company.

To be credible, I would like to see an official statement backed by a reveal of at least part of the contracts they sign with publishers and developers showing us that they can legally removed the DRM at any time.

The problem is that it would be trivially easy for them to lie about. It's good PR and no one will know until the company really goes bankrupt, at which point it won't matter that they lied. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The major reasons why the DPS is much higher in SC2 is that units have good pathfinding, and that they can be stacked more tightly. By default, BW units form a conga line, which makes them very weak unless you micromanage them. See [Day9 for a very long video about BW micro](https://youtu.be/rWvoMrYCQBU). So, it requires a lot of skill to make them do their optimal DPS. Protoss players would set up moving armies that actually require a lot of effort to set up. 

As for the second point, stacking, most BW maps had tight chokepoints that made it almost impossible to stack a lot of units tightly. The units were slightly larger, the maps tighter, and combined with the poor pathfinding and limited united selection, it makes it impossible to have a 1A deathball, as you pointed out. So BW was more a series of small assaults, with some big confrontations sometimes taking place, but even the larger battles were not completely decisive.

-

One other mistake IMO are the high ground mechanics, which don't give the high ground as much of an advantage. So there's much less strategic terrain. 

Another related point is that too many units can cross over cliffs and even warp instantly across the map (protoss gateway). This makes it so that cliffs are less strategic, so defense and terrain have less importance. The protoss gateway ability means that Protoss had to be nerfed in other ways and that it becomes a central part of their design.

Also, most of the micro is gone. Watch the day9 video for an explanation. But it's just, as I've said that units do their highest DPS on a 1A command, without needing any micro. And casters don't have to be selected individually. </TEXT>

But the game was never as exciting as BW where new tactics were being developed.

BW had long bouts when it didn't seem balanced but then someone would invent a new tactic.

By that do you mean that the same 5 maps were used for almost all the dungeons, making it the most repetitive game ever?

The biggest problem was probably the story, which didn't have the subtlety of the first. Every mage was corrupt. It reminded me of some of Blizzard's writing in Starcraft II (not a compliment).

And I didn't like the whole rebranding as an "edgy" action game. It ditched most of its dnd heritage. </TEXT>

The fact is that the number of games released increases each year and they all compete with each other for our time. So they have to be better and better to get our attention. And so the standards for a good game keep rising.

That's what I'm worried about. Scorpio will be $499 and most users will think that it's too expensive.

Technically, it seems to be superb, but do users really care about 4k resolution? My guess is that few users really care that much about 1080p vs 4k. After a while, you don't really notice the extra resolution. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's getting pretty good reviews on IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2461520/

"

An excellent movie, though certainly not uplifting. Reviewers and others who hated it probably did so because the movie is not "pretty", contains no car chases, no nudity, no digitally enhanced B.S., and no sappy, contrived, over-the-top drama. To paraphrase part of the movie, it's all real". Worst of all for many who would prefer to live without acknowledging facts, it reminds us that America does not support its troops; America discards its troops. As the end credits declare, there are hundreds of thousands of discarded, homeless vets. Many with PTSD roam untreated, likewise discarded. We likely do not report those men/women as injured. The next time you feel all rah-rah about the U.S. sending troops into battle for reasons unclear, think of this show. Excellent acting, dialogue sometimes tough to understand. Those of you who want to "fight for America", know that t hose who sent you to war will not fight for you.

<TEXT> Thanks for the answer. I think you mean GPLv2.

The shaders README says that "The copyright of these shaders belong to their respective authors and they are licensed under the General Public License v2 unless otherwise stated."

Higan is GPLv3. I thought that they would be compatible, but [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_compatibility) says that "GPLv2 itself is not compatible with GPLv3". This means you would need to contact the authors and relicense them under the GPLv3, if Wikipedia is accurate.

Edit: Maybe you could have the shaders be easily downloadable in one click or something. Also, I wonder if you upsample the SNES image before applying the shaders. SNES9x allows the image to be rendered at a higher resolution. I imagine that would make the shaders look a bit better.
Edit2: The shaders look nice, but some don't work and make screen black. For others (like NTSC), the scanlines disappear when I go fullscreen. </TEXT>

Not that old. The Dreamcast was released in October 1999, the PS2 in 2000, and the Gamecube and Xbox in 2001. So in 1997, you were still 3 years away from the next generation of consoles. Probably a similar situation to where we are now compared to the next gen Playstation and Xbox. </TEXT>

Companies throw away most of their stuff. Preservation is the exception, not the norm. Atari just threw away all their original design material. Why? Because preservation costs money and has no immediate benefits.

<TEXT> There are many consoles, but few arcade cabinets. You only address mainstream console gaming. In 30 years, there won't be as many consoles left.

Emulators have the advantage of being portable. Even if Microsoft goes bankrupt in 2029, emulators will still work on Linux or whatever is the new operating system. Consoles stop working once the hardware is dead and it's not always easy or possible to repair it. Also, with DRM you can lose access to your games. Future consoles might not work at all when not connected to a proprietary server over the Internet. This is already the case with Steam (and other competitors). If Valve, EA or Ubisoft go bankrupt you will lose access to all the games you have on those services.

Over time, more and more stuff gets lost. Just imagine what will happen in 100 years. Old consoles and old games will all suffer from bit rot, and disappear except for a few copies kept in museums. The best way to preserve games is through emulators that are constantly updated and ported to new operating systems.

Read this here:http://docs.mamedev.org/whatis.html

"MAMEs purpose is to preserve decades of software history. As electronic technology continues to rush forward, MAME prevents this important vintage software from being lost and forgotten. This is achieved by documenting the hardware and how it functions. The source code to MAME serves as this documentation. The fact that the software is usable serves primarily to validate the accuracy of the documentation (how else can you prove that you have recreated the hardware faithfully?). Over time, MAME absorbed the sister-project MESS (Multi Emulator Super System), so MAME now documents a wide variety of (mostly vintage) computers, video game consoles and calculators, in addition to the arcade video games that were its initial focus.

MAME main purpose is to be a reference to the inner workings of the emulated machines. This is done both for educational purposes and for preservation purposes, in order to prevent historical software from disappearing forever once the hardware it runs on stops working. Of course, in order to preserve the software and demonstrate that the emulated behavior matches the original, one must also be able to actually use the software. This is considered a nice side effect, and is not MAMEs primary focus." </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is that traditional libraries and archives are not interested in preserving software.

Also, you have to preserve not only the software, but also the means to read it. So, you have to either preserve the original hardware and maintain it, or emulate it. 

Some emulators are dedicated to this mission. MAME's primary goal is not to play games but to document the hardware. The emulation serves not only to play arcade games, but can also be used to repair original arcade cabinets.  </TEXT>

There will. Games are increasingly being released on digital mediums only. Who will preserve xbox arcade games?

Shops will only preserve games that they can sell. They'll throw the other ones away because inventory space costs money. Where can you find old DOS games, or Wonderswan games for sale? What about demos or prototypes?

<TEXT> The HD graphics are pretty good, but there are a lot of things that don't feel quite right.

The Zerg are the worst. Look at [this picture of HD graphics](http://i.imgur.com/AmfolmM.jpg) vs [SD](http://i.imgur.com/mA9DqDk.jpg), taken from [here](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/brood-war/520464-an-interview-with-the-devs-of-starcraft-remastered).

Zerg buildings look desiccated. In the gifs, they aren't throbbing like the originals. The spawning pool, should be a pool filled with liquid. Now it looks completely dry. Zerg buildings are supposed to look like scary fleshy things, almost like exposed human organs. They need to add some of that living, organic look back. Pump them with water.

Not a big fan of the Ultralisk tusks which look like mammoth tusks instead of blades. The queen looks okay, but the original was a bit better. The defiler has lost its hind legs.

The hydra is probably going one of the most controversial. I always imagined it differently, as a kind of fleshy blob.

-
The carrier isn't quite as nice. The new "lines" which they added don't look right. The proportions of almost all the parts also aren't right and the material they used looks too reflective.

The BC mostly gets it right, but the cannon barrels are too flared. They look like cheap props.

TvP comparison: [HD](http://i.imgur.com/NtelxId.jpg) vs. [SD](http://i.imgur.com/Y5ItkU4.jpg)

First, props for getting the dragoons right. The cannons on the siege tanks are too short and the "dual flashlights" at the bottom are way too big. They weren't visible in the original and it should probably stay that way.

The vultures hover a bit too high and are now less visible. Not a big deal.

The water is less detailed. They didn't draw the parts where the water meets the shore. The [zealots and temple HD](http://www.teamliquid.net/staff/lichter/SCR/ZealotsHD.jpg) vs. [SD](http://www.teamliquid.net/staff/lichter/SCR/ZealotsSD.jpg) shot also shows how they didn't bother to add quite as much detail. The medallion isn't filled back in with a carving, but looks empty  (there is a subtle carving if you zoom in). The zealots look good though ;) In other shots, like the snow one, I feel like they lost some of the beauty of the original, but it's hard to pin down. Tiling is more obvious in many places because of the fine details.

More comparisons [here](https://starcraft.com/en-us/) (moving gifs made by Blizzard).

The probes look too much like bugs IMO and those cannons don't look right. In that last shot, the undeployed tanks look pretty ugly. Their threads don't have any shadows, the proportions are wrong, and they're missing some details.

The minerals also look wrong. They lack any internal reflections which gives them a plastic look.

They still got a lot of it right, and it's an impressive effort as HD graphics are not cheap to make.

<TEXT> Turning off the UI in W3 made the experience so much more enjoyable. Too bad you can't really play this way. The default UI just has so many indicators and stuff going on, you'd think you're operating an aircraft. 

That's also why I play Skyrim with iHud, which fades the HUD away unless you need.

Personally, I don't like the complexity of these games anymore, inventory management, mutagens, potions, crafting, comparing gear. I would like to just be able to play the game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bioware has been gradually moving away from their Dungeon and Dragons (DnD) roots. Kotor was a kind of simplified Dnd in space. ME was more focused on action, but the combat still resembled Dnd. The first Dragon Age was very close to a Dnd experience. ME2, and then ME3 became more action focused. DA2 was action focused and DA:I ditched the DnD combat in favor of MMORPG combat, while preserving as an option something that resembled the old Dnd combat, but only superficially. Now ME:A has completely purged the remaining Dnd elements. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Games are now huge productions and sadly writing isn't properly valued. One problem is that it's hard to determine what is good or bad writing. Executives have a tendency of wanting to play safe by reusing a story that worked in the past. It's also hard to show off good writing in a demo.

Also, videogame companies won't really hire dedicated writers who have a liberal arts education. Avellone for example had a major in English and a minor in fine arts. John Gonzalez (FNV and HZD) has an English major and a master in social work. Drew Karpyshyn was working on his masters in English when he was hired by Bioware.

These aren't necessarily the profiles companies are looking for. </TEXT>

That's funny because KOTOR has some of the most horrible talking animations: https://youtu.be/irnl-3B0qE0

KOTOR2 developers Obsidian lost a ton of time trying to make precisely executed cutscenes, only to find out that the engine wasn't capable of that kind of fine control.

E.g. Obsidian was working on an exclusive RPG for the X1 named Stormlands which got cancelled late into development. By contrast, Sony has nurtured developers, even going as far as giving The Last Guardian a decade or so. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree. Is it that fun to get stuck on the dog puzzle? In reality, this is a poorly designed puzzle that should have more hints. The game designers probably never play tested it. 

I like the idea that the world is laid out in a semi-realistic manner. But backtracking and having to carry random items for 20hours with a very limited inventory is not good design.

This video obviously edited out the tedious parts, which the game doesn't. I'm all for modern game design that respects the player's time. </TEXT>

No it wouldn't, especially not a translation from Japanese to English which requires creative adaptation. 

IMO, the translation is a derivative work, but it's still owned by the translator. He doesn't have the right to distribute it, but the company can't use it either. If they could, then does that mean that Bethesda could just take Skyrim mods and sell them since they're also derivative works?

<TEXT> Because voters are ignorant and polarized. Many people don't vote, or vote on a single issue (abortion), or just listen to Fox News all day. They never bother to look at what the politicians they vote for are actually doing. Or they buy their views that all forms of regulation are bad. 

For example, that [higher mercury emissions create jobs!](http://www.manchin.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/in-the-news?ID=85d6083f-53c2-4042-b039-fda7b0ce825a) "Manchin has previously introduced legislation that would delay the implementation of the Environmental Protection Agency's Utility Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. The standards are designed to limit exposure to mercury and other air toxics from U.S. power plants." "From the day I arrived in the Senate, I have been determined to stop the EPA's jobs-killing agenda, and this Resolution of Disapproval takes an important step to rein in this out-of-control agency" This is from a Republican senator's website.

You just need to tell voters that the FCC is a regulator, and that it's curtailing freedom, and they'll agree with you, as long as they don't find out you're actually talking about giving their sole Internet provider the permission to spy on them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You kind of drifted off on another subject midway with Citra. So let's ignore that part.

I don't see how videos could hurt an emulator. I know that [JohnGodGames](https://www.youtube.com/user/pcmaker2) files bug reports for rpcs3. By watching his videos, I can quickly see what is the state of PS3 emulation, even if I don't own all those games, or can't be bothered to test them. His Patreon is currently at 1$ and I don't think he gets any income from youtube, so I don't think he's ripping anyone off.

RPCS3's official channel reposted a youtuber (BlastProcessing)'s footage for Catherine. So, they're finding it useful.

There's not a lot of content in this sub, so why not have a few videos? I agree that some are really annoying and low quality, but I think that they mostly get removed.

<TEXT>  The library was kind of meant to be that, but different. It wasn't intended to import your entire collection into the library, just the games you're playing.

I see. Well, it kind of suggests to me that I would import my whole library.

If you grab the quark shaders, they are pretty decent. They can certainly do everything Snes9X can do and more. But maybe Snes9X has more made for it, I'm not sure.

I know that there are external shaders, but I'm not going to try them if they're not there by default (nor will most users).

A nasty, nasty side effect of Windows. Their default list view is so limited as to be completely useless. To allow per-cell icons, fonts, colors, etc I have to custom draw the control. And after doing that, it stops auto-handling text search ahead. Have yet to find a workaround.

I can't help you, but having a good UI is really important. Have you seen MedLaunch (Windows only). This [screenshot](http://medlaunch.asnitech.co.uk/user/pages/03.screenshots/games02.png) gives a good idea of how it works. While not perfect by any means, it has a search bar and it's able to scrape info from Mobygames and other sites. You can sort games by year, last time played, etc. It's really great in this regard.

(An issue that I'm having right now is that I can't change my library location (wanted to move it out of my C drive). Higan will just do nothing when I select a new folder and of course I can't just type in a new location. Is this normal?) Thanks for responding to my post btw. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It's literally, open program, choose "Library - Load ROM image", pick game, you're playing it.

My suggestion would be to add "File - Load ROM image".

 It would be more intuitive as 

1) A file is being loaded that is not in the library, so this has nothing to do with the library. Normally, files have to be added to a library in order to be loaded. It's illogical that the option to directly load a file be found there. In Itunes for example, I can't directly play a file without adding it to my library first. This is probably the concept that most users are familiar with.

 2) This is similar to what other emulators do. 

3) It would put the most important and most desired functionality first. This is always a good thing. And it would create a positive reward loop for users of your emulator. They might then be interested in learning how to use the more complex library function. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's awesome that you're developing these cores. Kega Fusion is good, but I'd rather have everything under one emulator. 

Also, I think it's really cool that you're doing this. It's not just about the end result, but also about the process of trying to reverse engineer a system.

My gripes about Higan right now are actually about really small things, like the fact that it's not possible to search within the game library, or press a letter, say "G" to jump to games that start with this letter. There's also no "recently played games" list. For some reason, I need to remap my control input all the time because Higan forgets it. And the controller configuration doesn't automatically jump to the next button. And shaders of course aren't as good as SNES9x. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not just Bioware IMO. Torment:Tides of Numenera, WL2 and Pillars of Eternity all have somewhat sketchy writing. 

It shows how hard it is to write compelling characters.

Bioware has some pretty good writers: Drew Karpyshyn (ME1) and David Gaider (DA:O). They were not perfect or anything but they wrote mostly good stories.

I wonder if some of it is due to millennials being brought up in the digital age and not reading as much as previous generations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not overly surprised by the delays. CR doesn't have a very good track record as a manager. Microsoft had to come in and kick him out on Freelancer because development had bogged down because of feature creep. It kind of seems like the same thing is happening here. His standards are insanely high. Development was delayed by months, if not years to get that unified animation system. He has a tendency to always be chasing the latest feature and wanting to "get things right", which can result in endless delays. 

I'm sure that Bioware hit the ground running ME:A. They knew exactly what had to be done to deliver the game and I'm sure that it was still a lot of work with plenty of unexpected setbacks. They had an engine and tools and a company and experienced artists and programmers, which CR all had to build up. CR doesn't have experience delivering AAA games. CIG spent much of its time working on backend features, cool ships, and marketing, but did they understand the work that would be required to deliver a AAA single player game? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obsidian seems to think that world building can replace narrative. It can't. Lore is just background stuff. It's the setting for the story, but it's not really interesting. 

Games like KOTOR or DA:O have interesting companions because they react to things happening in the world, to what you say and do, and also to what other characters do. They're not just ranting about what happened eons ago. The lore in those games tends to be kept reasonable. We know a little about what happened in the past, but we're not overloaded with information. 

And you have a clear objective. You're saving the world. A bit cheesy but you're never wandering aimlessly around the world.

<TEXT> I'm not far into the game, but the writing so far is very janky.

In the first area, there are three events where you relive a memory. The writing is kind of confusing. But I think it's just a bad idea to have you read three different short stories in a row. What novel starts off with 3 unrelated short stories? It takes a lot of effort to get into a story. I don't want to spend the time to immerse myself into that story just for it to be discarded moments later. 

These elaborate stories are just for turning on lights that allow you to progress. Any other game would just have had you click on them and that would probably have been better.

What made PS:Torment great was not that it had lots of pretentious writing. I don't think the writers were trying to be pretentious at all. It's that it had genuinely funny characters. It also had an intriguing world and good hook: Why can't I die? Who am I? Why do I keep losing my memories? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first game was in development for 7 years, while the second one was rushed out in about 2 years.

But more significantly, Bioware abandoned its PnP/Dungeons and Dragons roots. (Coincidentally, DA2 was developed after Bioware was acquired by EA in 2007.) The first game was a reimagining of the classic Dnd experience. It was an infinity engine game in 3D but much better, with deeper choices and well written characters.


DA2 was mostly an action game, designed to appeal to a mainstream console gamer audience. Brent Knowles says it well here:
"During the pre-development of the game, Brent Knowles, a veteran lead designer who had been with BioWare for a decade and the central figurehead behind Dragon Age: Origins, decided to resign during the designing process of Dragon Age II and eventually left the company, stating "I'm not the same person I was when I started, and BioWare is not the same company." He later went on to clarify his decision to leave, elaborating "I never thought Dragon Age II would be a terrible game. It was just that a highly cinematic, action-leaning RPG was not what I wanted to work on. That is all."" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Age_II#Development

It's pretty clear to me that EA gave orders to produce a game to fit a mainstream console target audience and the game was rushed out to hit a certain quarter. Bioware had never focused as much on the "dumb" mainstream console crowd, though it had been slowly transitioning towards making more mainstream games. It had however always thrived to make intelligent games. DA2 was their first "dumb" game IMO. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you consider yourself to be a hosting service as opposed to a digital conservation project? Why wouldn't you want to edit the library cards of items in your collection? 

On a practical note, do you check for viruses? Some files say that they include cracks. So they're not the original file and could contain a trojan. At least, you should make it clear that they're not the original disk.

To make a definitive archive, you'd need to have certain standards for dumping disks and try to identify different revisions of the software, as well carefully preserving the game manuals, box art etc. A bit like what /u/byuu is doing with snes games.

Your archive will be fairly useless to researchers and users in general if there's no standardized metadata.

There are just some really strange things in there, like this: 

"Free Internet Design Solutions Inspirations Collection .
This Archive Is The Result Of 8 Years Searching The Web . 
Now I Choosed Them As A Gift For Kind Believers In GOD , The Most Beneficent , The Most Merciful .
I mean The Believers Who Believe In GOD , The Most Beneficent , The Most Merciful , Because OF Love , Not The Believers That Believe In GOD  , The Most Beneficent , The Most Merciful , Because Of Fray From The GOD . I Mean The Believers Who Love The GOD , The Most Beneficent , The Most Merciful , Because Of The GOD , The Most Beneficent , The Most Merciful , And Their Hope Is Going To Be In Paradise , Not The Believers That Believe In GOD , The Most Beneficent , The Most Merciful , Becuase Of The Hell ." (https://archive.org/details/FreeInternetDesignSolutions)

I'm not saying that it's not valuable, but... 

The collections you have are a bit confusing. For example, you have: "MS-DOS Games", "MS-DOS", "Software Library" and "Classic PC Games" that all contain MS DOS games. If you were curating the games as a single collection, it would make sense to have all the MS DOS games in one place, all the Apple software in another, etc.

I guess it makes some sense if you're just creating a collection of collections and not curating them yourself. I just noticed that each collection is curated by a different archivist. They're self-contained universes. 

Maybe you should make that clear and explain your project better. I don't see any explanation of what you're doing. There's only a bit of text tied to each collection, but what are your goals for the whole project? You should write something explaining your goals and methodology. </TEXT>

So, I'm right that it was one of the last games developed before the acquisition. Development was almost over at that point. ME2 development was started in 2008, so after the acquisition.

<TEXT>  I really feel like this and ME2 were the last great games from Bioware, everything since has just felt uninspired in comparison. 

I agree. ~~They were~~ DA:O was also kind of the last games developed before they were bought by EA. DA2 was rushed to hit a certain quarter ~~(I think that was just before they were bought)~~. The game was unfinished and I didn't like the "edgy" dark look or the focus on action. Inquisition wasn't really memorable. It had a pretty cheesy villain and the plot wasn't really interesting. Combat was ripped from MMORPGs and not very interesting.

Edit: According to Wikipedia Bioware was bought by EA in October 2007. DA:O was released in late 2009 and ME2 in January 2010. Development on DA:O started in 2002.

"Typically, you want to dump your own PlayStation 3 games and software from your own console. We believe that this is the most efficient and safest way to migrate your disc-based games and digital games from your console to your PC. To do this, you will need a PlayStation 3 system with a custom firmware and various software tools that are used to rip/dump games from your system's Blu-ray drive or internal storage.

<TEXT> In addition to what's been said, some games require more accurate emulation of low level features. For example, on Dolphin, some games require MMU emulation which is very slow. Most games run fine with a more basic emulation.

 In general, emulators are full of hacks and high level emulation, except for a few low level emulators like bsnes/Higan that emulate older hardware. When these hacks can't be used and more accuracy is required, emulation gets slower. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Microsoft is out of touch. Their focus on TV when the XboxOne launched was embarrassing.

[Here's](http://kotaku.com/how-a-small-game-studio-almost-made-it-big-1696997142) how they mismanaged a new IP from a small studio. "

"Darkside was in the very early stages of development when E3 came around in June of last year, and some at the studio say they were shocked to see Microsoft announce Phantom Dust there. They were even more shocked to see the game announced through a pre-rendered trailer that nobody at Darkside had worked on, according to studio sources. Perhaps most frustratingly for people at the studio, Microsoft wouldnt tell anyone that Darkside was developing the game. Darkside was put on a gag order; though the game had been announced, they still couldnt tell people they were making it."

And there are other bizarre moments. Microsoft kept adding demands while not increasing the budget. According to this account, dealing with Microsoft more like dealing with a bipolar, unpredictable bureaucracy. It's the opposite of nurturing a studio. 

Microsoft cancelled Obsidian's exclusive RPG Stormlands that was due to be released for the XboxOne launch. [Fergus Urqhart](http://ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/why-kotor-2-devs-xbox-one-launch-game-was-canceled-a-ign-unfiltered) puts it down to "not having a champion" at Microsoft.

<TEXT> Convenience is also the biggest factor for me. It's also something that emulator developers tend to be a bit dismissive of:

"UI design is not important." 

"You can do X already: you just need to edit a text file, download this and this, and jump through a hoop three times. No need for me to add this feature." 

In reality, if a feature is more than a few clicks away, most of your userbase will not use it. The 80-20 rule says that everytime that you make your users jump through a hurdle, you lose 80% of them. </TEXT>

According to [this thread](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/forums/showthread.php?3616-How-do-old-game-budgets-compare-to-new-game-budgets) (Not the best source, I know):

"The budget for Fallout 1 was $3 million"

"Games like Grim Fandango cost a hefty $3 million back in 1998. Full Throttle cost just over $2 million to produce, and Psychonauts had a whopping $12 million dollar budget back in 2005, equivalent to the $12 million dollar budget of gPotato's 2010 AAA MMO, Allods Online. Yikes.

(...)

the original Gears of War only had a budget of $10 million

There's also another factor of game budgets a lot of people don't talk about...see back in the 1990s and early 00s, video game budgets were mostly centered around artists, programmers, designers, QA and testers. Nowadays, a huge portion of a game's budget resides in marketing, in fact, for some games, 200% of the budget will go into marketing while the game itself will cost anywhere between $10 and $20 million to actually design and produce.
In the early 90s, video game budgets were around $100,000  when Doom was released in 1993 it had cost $200,000 and was touted as one of the most expensive games at the time."

150k copies * $20, would mean a gross of $3M for the developer, just enough to recoup the development costs.

One reason might be that the story is not THAT engaging. You mostly run from point A to point B, never having deep interactions with anyone. Also, FPS games have improved on almost all of the mechanical aspects. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  . Maybe I'm embellishing this time period but I firmly believe it was the golden age for innovation and gaming. Developers could try out all these new ideas without the fear of going bankrupt.

Eurogamer in one of their recent videos (about the Fallout 2 sex formula) talked about how Black Isle had a "frat house" atmosphere at that time. Developers just added things because they thought it was funny. This didn't always lead to good content, but it did lead to a lot more creativity. 

Also developers didn't have to cater to the needs of a large, mainstream audience. They were mostly making games for a small fairly nerdy audience. I can't find exact numbers, but those numbers are [floating around](http://www.nma-fallout.com/threads/how-many-units-would-you-say-fallout-1-2-sold.200521/page-2):

"Baldur's Gate (all formats) 500,000

BG expansion pack 156,000

Fallout 144,000

Fallout 2 123,000

Diablo 1,300,000

Be honest and say that you need the money for buying back these games as it's your most pressing need, but that if the games reappear, or if you get more money than you need, you'll use the money to fund other preservation efforts. It's not like the money will go to waste IMO. You can use it to pay for more expensive shipping and better insurance.

Yes, it's true. But the more different stores there are, the more pressure there will be on Steam to reduce their cut. If they were to become a monopoly, they might increase it to 50%. If they have to compete hard, they might be forced to lower it to 15%. That's why competition is important. </TEXT>

Activision Blizzard had a revenue of $6.6B in 2016. If they had to pay a 30% cut to Steam, it would amount to almost $2B! They could develop a few new IPs from scratch with that money, or return it to investors. There's a huge incentive for them to move away from Steam. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's true that it's annoying to have multiple storefronts, which naturally leads to the most popular stores becoming monopolies. However, this is pretty bad for developers and consumers since it gaves immense power to the most successful storefronts. At 30%, the Steam tax is pretty heavy. If a game has revenues of $100M, $30M will go to Steam and $70M to the publisher. That's a huge cut  just for handling the digital distribution of the game. </TEXT>

They can only charge this because Steam has some monopoly power at this point. It is THE platform that everyone wants to be on. Bethesda actually developed the IP. They deserve the money more than Steam IMO. Steam has already recouped their costs 100x over.

Skyrim sold 11,5M copies on steam. At a conservative $40 per copy for 11,5M copies, they've already raked in $138M, while Bethesda got $322M. I think they've already paid for the simple download functionality they offer many times over. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This highlights nicely what I think Bethesda main flaw has been in FO3 and FO4: just not thinking through their ideas at all to form a coherent story and a coherent world. The original FO designers and Obsidian really thought about how the world could possibly work. I'm sure that some details don't match, but it's obvious that they thought about the world and the story and about what second order consequences could stem from the elements they put in place. Factions have coherent motivations. Beth just doesn't seem capable of thinking that far. What are this faction's motivations? What is the most efficient strategy for them to achieve their goal? Who is blocking them?

Some of their ideas have absolutely no depth. Take Megaton. There's a city with a bomb underneath. A cult worships the bomb. You can either set off the bomb for no reason and be super evil, or not do it. It's not an intelligent nor an interesting choice. </TEXT>

[source](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2014-01-30/miyazaki/the-problem-with-the-anime-industry-is-it-full-of-otaku).

I think is point is very valid and also applies to games, including Fallout 4. The games industry tends to be mostly staffed by nerds who reference other games and nerd culture (like the red wedding). There's nothing wrong with that but it makes that culture very insular. Fallout 4 suffers from that IMO. The story doesn't seem to be connected to real themes from the real world. It doesn't make any point about our society. All the ideas go nowhere and fizzle out. And Pagliarulo might very well be an example of the kind of designer that Miyazaki was criticizing. I admit there are some good sequences in FO4, but overall it fails to tell something important or to create real characters. </TEXT>

When I use Dolphin, I can get inside a game and playing in just a few clicks. The possibility of making a mistake is fairly low. It doesn't cause mental strain. It doesn't need to be learned.

Learning takes time and time is valuable. Every extra minute that I spend learning how to use your program is one minute that I'm not using to play a game or do something else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Given that CC companies take about 2.5%, a 0% cut is probably unrealistic. But if they wanted to show that they support modders and aren't just there to rake in money, they would take a 3%-5% cut. Beth could then take a more reasonable 5-10% cut and it would end up at around 10%-15%. The combined 75% cut showed they were hoping to make big bucks and didn't care about modders. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think this contradicts what I wrote. Someone might create an unofficial patch anyway for ES6 if there are paid mods, but I'm sure there would be less motivation/collaboration. We would possibly see many different unofficial patches all trying to grab some money.

I'll paste the Q/A for everyone to see:

"Will the unofficial patch ever cost money if paid mods return?

Short answer: No.

Longer answer: The unofficial patches are a community driven effort in probably the purest possible way. It would be wrong of us to attempt to capitalize on that by suddenly shifting to a for-profit model for these patches. Even if there were to be some super simple way to remove all of the logistical and legal barriers to trying it, we still wouldn't do it. Put simply: It would be wrong on so many levels. So no. The unofficial patches will never cost money. They will always remain free.

If we are involved in the effort to generate unofficial patches for Elder Scrolls VI, those will also remain free." </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Bethesda would certainly sell fewer copies of their games if users could not freely download tonnes of optional (and some really high quality) content. Skyrim would have came out, been a top seller for a few months like most other AAA titles and then fizzled out.

I think they underestimate that effect. The unofficial patch would probably not exist with paid mods. It wouldn't really work as a paid mod and why make a free mods when others are making money on them? You would just feel like a sucker. Most mods would probably not have been made. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It would be more reasonable if they took 3% and 4.5% IMO. Valve's infrastructure costs are very small and they already made their money on the base game. They support free mods for free. 

Bethesda again has already recouped its money on the base game. Whatever they get will be pure profit.

Asking for a combined 75% cut was greedy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A couple of the problems were/are:

- Valve + publisher kept 75% of the money
- Piracy - Of course, Valve didn't bother policing copyright infringement, so stolen assets/mods.

- Spirit of sharing in the community. Modders share ideas, are part of a community. Having paid mods destroys this.
- Some of the best mods are not paid. Feels unfair to have a mod that took 10 hours to make rake in money, while the Unofficial Skyrim Patch is free.
- Modding will only exist within Valve's walled garden. Valve and publishers will now completely control modding. If they decide to pull the plug, everything disappears. Nexus mods will not be allowed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recommend MOO2 with the [ICE mod](http://moo2mod.com/). You probably won't notice anything at first but it rebalances the game.

2 features of MOO2 that haven't been replicated much are 

1) choice between technologies. You have to make hard choices between X and Y technology, depending on your situation. This makes the game more strategic and interesting.

2) freighters. They allow population and food transfers between colonies but have a certain cost and can be blockaded.

I recommend playing on a small map. In fact, I recommend that for almost any 4x since large maps just end up taking forever and being micromanagement nightmares - and me never reaching the end game. With a small map, you actually can finish the game. 

Graphics are primitive, but it's not so bad once you get used to it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is that nobody ever fixes those loopholes. Companies exploit every loophole they can find in the laws of 10 different countries, and then end up paying close to 0 taxes.

There's an inherent unfairness in the system. The more profits you make, the less taxes you pay because the better you are able to game the international tax system.

It's a bit like once your character reaches a certain level, you can just ignore the rules that apply to everyone else on the server. This is an exploit and should be patched.

Game companies will punish players who aggressively exploit bugs all the time. I don't think it's unfair to blame companies who rush in to exploit every bug in the international tax system. Especially not when they then lobby politicians to make sure the exploits are never patched. In some cases, companies like Apple made special deals with the government - private cheat codes if you will. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The dice roll systems aimed to be "more realistic". A real sword fight will probably be over after the first hit. So the fight happens before that first hit is scored. The "to hit" dice rolls mimic that. It's the fencing match that happens before anyone is hit.

It's generally a fun mechanic in PnP RPGs and it worked fine in older games.

" After looking through the git repository, it looks like someone fixed a handful of things that I was either too lazy to implement properly or just completely forgot about.  One thing he fixed was my implementation of section loading; a proper solution was lacking and I lazily added what was necessary for a few games just to test it.  I looked through that code thinking "man, I sure hope somebody fixed that", and bam, it was there, lol.  They also did a way with alot of the previous FS stuff.  Interesting nonetheless."

<TEXT> Wouldn't surprise me. 180k owners according to [steam spy](https://steamspy.com/app/298050), which isn't great.

They focused a lot on the graphics, which, IMO, don't really matter for a game like this. I don't even like the new portraits that much but that's just me. The Meklar look like the Geth from Mass Effect. Humans went from civilian to military. The new portraits reflect all the new cliches seen in games and movies.

MOO2 with the [ICE mod](http://moo2mod.com/) is still my favorite 4x game. It plays great with smaller galaxies and it still has many unique concepts, like freighters that weren't copied much. 

At least they kept the concept of having to choose one upgrade over the other for most techs, which is something that most 4X games don't do anymore. IMO, having to make hard choices is what makes games interesting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think he nailed it when he said that the focus of DX1 was on player choice and experimentation, not the setting or aesthetics. 

A lot of it had to do with the era that the game was made in, where they could get away with minimalistic graphics.

I like all the art in MD and HR. Eidos Montreal obviously has extremely talented artists, but this focus on art took away from the gameplay and player choice IMO. If the game had been built in the Unreal 1 engine with featureless walls and props, they would have been forced to focus on gameplay. That angel is an good example. I stumbled upon it in a random apartment. Why did that person decorate his apartment in that way? It seems that everyone in Prague decorates their apartments in really weird ways. While it's beautiful, I didn't feel like it really belonged. I have to wonder how many hours went into it. It probably took as long as making half a Deus Ex 1 level.

I just played through the original Deus Ex and it stands the test of time. Yes, it does get tedious at times. Some missions are weaker and overly long, like the ship mission. But the main gameplay loop is fun. You have multiple ways of solving every mission, and it's really fun to outsmart the guards and sneak up on them from behind. By contrast, the MD levels feel cramped and the takedown ability just isn't as fun. It feels cheap to be able to take down opponents without having to sneak up from behind. And at the same time it's frustrating that your main limit on this ability is having to wait for your internal battery to recharge. That just forces you to arbitrarily slow down. </TEXT>

It is also guilty of trampling far too much on people's privacy, by keeping tabs of all their comings and goings. 

Rather than offer incentives, the company has resorted to spreading FUD (fear, uncertainly and doubt) among its corporate customersas IBM did back in the 1970s whenever customers threatened to desert Big Blue for rival suppliers. Since the start of the year, Microsofts corporate users have been warned that, even with security updates, Windows 7 simply does not have the architecture to cope with todays threats. The remedial work needed to recover from malware attacks can only drive up operating costs. The message to sceptical systems managers: postpone the inevitable upgrade at your peril.


Along with additional bells and whistles, [the Creators Update (effectively Windows 10.2) due in April], is said to be more secure than even the current version, while offering somewhat better privacy controls for users. But news that Microsoft has baked advertising into the operating systempushing third-party apps as well as its own software and servicescould be enough to make many a reluctant upgrader have second thoughts.

It used to be that only free software came with advertising; users paid a fee, if they chose to do so, to get the software free of advertising. Microsoft charges top dollar for Windows 10 ($120 or $200, depending on the edition) and now wants to bombard users with sales pitches to bootwithout so much as by your leave, let alone the option to turn the nuisance off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> IMO, they needed more areas, even at the cost of reducing the level of detail in each area. Part of the appeal of Deus Ex is travelling around the world.

Prague is wonderfully crafted, but this is a game, not a work of art. I don't find sneaking into random apartments that interesting. It's like they poured all their energies into side content while they forgot  to cook the main dish.

The original Deus Ex was huge with really interesting and varied levels. Of course, each level cost a lot less to make back then. You were always kept engaged by the main story and had a clear objective. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In ME3, you have the choice between the [Spoiler](#s "control, synthesis or destruction") endings. The problem is that these choices don't really stem from issues that are discussed throughout the game. Also, the ending doesn't really explain who the reapers are or why they do what they have been doing. It's not an interesting choice.

The original Deus Ex has a more interesting choice. You either [Spoiler](#s "side with the illuminati (elite capitalism and surveillance society), the triad boss (anarchy and destruction of all communication networks), or the AI (benevolent rule by a superintelligent AI).") I would have liked to have more choices. These are 3 pretty bleak choices for the fate of the world, and it's clear which one was favored by the game designers. But the choices at least make sense within the game and present an interesting dilemma.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's obvious that they weren't able to fully realize their vision in MD, and had to rush the game to completion. They were probably refused an extension or even had their budget cut short by Squeenix.

I wouldn't be surprised if they had planned for two or three different city hubs, just like in Human Revolution. 

But the constraints of AAA development are very harsh. Eidos Montreal is a mid-sized studio. They just weren't able to deliver a huge, polished game, with a next-gen engine and next-gen visuals.

They focused on quality above quantity. Their engine is great and the environments in the game are beautiful, but that probably was done at the expense of producing more content. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ~~Especially since Kickstarter basically allows you to ask for a refund if goals are not met.~~

Edit: This is not quite correct. As others have pointed out, it's the backers who would have to take legal action. Here is what the terms of service say:

"If a creator is unable to complete their project and fulfill rewards, theyve failed to live up to the basic obligations of this agreement. To right this, they must make every reasonable effort to find another way of bringing the project to the best possible conclusion for backers. A creator in this position has only remedied the situation and met their obligations to backers if:

-they post an update that explains what work has been done, how funds were used, and what prevents them from finishing the project as planned;

-they work diligently and in good faith to bring the project to the best possible conclusion in a timeframe thats communicated to backers;

-theyre able to demonstrate that theyve used funds appropriately and made every reasonable effort to complete the project as promised;

-theyve been honest, and have made no material misrepresentations in their communication to backers; and

-they offer to return any remaining funds to backers who have not received their reward (in proportion to the amounts pledged), or else explain how those funds will be used to complete the project in some alternate form.

The creator is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their project. If theyre unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by backers. "

<TEXT> I agree that he shouldn't have made it about people. I don't care if writers have a degree in science, or law, or creative writing. 

The main problems  that I see with RPG writing are:


1) Lore is not that interesting by itself. It does not replace a good story. Too much focus on lore is distracting. Information dumps are bad.

2) Not enough editing and poor prose. Writers need to choose their words carefully. Longer doesn't mean better. Companies should try to hire experienced editors to catch mistakes and poor writing. I think this is his strongest argument. He points out several examples of poor writing in PoE, Tyranny and Torment: Tides of Numenera. He could probably also have picked almost any sentence in Wasteland 2 ;) (I disagree with his critique of Shadowrun HK, which has excellent writing IMO).

A bit of a rant, but I wonder if some of these problems don't stem from a lack of reading. Games writers should read lots of books, and not just sci-fi and fantasy. That's how you learn to write.

3) Writers should do more research into their subject. I'm generalizing his point about poor historical research. A game is more interesting when I know that the writer has done research on the time period and/or philosophical ideas presented in the game. However, doing research can be expensive.

4) Good stories are centered around 2 or 3 interesting characters. If your characters are not interesting or memorable, then your story will not be interesting. (This comes from me (and Harvey Smith).)

5) Don't forget humor. (Also comes from me.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Darth Roxor talks about the problem of excessive lore in his most recent article: http://www.rpgcodex.net/content.php?id=10511

"Lore - knowledge or information about a subject, for example nature or magic, that is not written down but is passed from person to person: "According to local lore, a ghost still haunts the castle."

This definition is interesting to us for one reason  information that is not written down. Now consider what the so-called lore is supposed to mean in your modern game  backstory that is dumped somewhere for the player to stumble upon. Nowadays you will even be given a whole submenu where all this is safely stowed away, and which you will likely never open."

"RPGs for a longer while have been suffering from an illness that I would call fantasitis, which has crept a long time ago into pulp fantasy literature, and which mostly entails (badly) copying the Tolkien approach  a fantasy world has to be grand, with a robust mythology, huge geography and history spanning over six millennia, to the point that you might as well forget about writing a fantasy novel if youre not planning (at least!) a trilogy from the get-go."  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally, I was a bit disappointed with PoE1's story and characters. I didn't feel compelled to go on.

[This review by Wolf](https://wolfsgamingblog.com/2015/04/08/pillars-of-eternity-review-yeah-its-pretty-good/) sums up my thought pretty well. 

"Where the game perhaps trips up is by not also opting to emulate the sense of humour its forebearers had. This is a game chock full of doom and gloom, and after a while it frankly became too much. Everybody seemed to be hiding horrible secrets and dark pasts, everybody seemed dire and dreich (Scottish word, look it up) and depressing. And thats perfectly fine, except for the fact that getting through Pillars of Eternity takes around 70-hours or so, and thats quite a lot of time to spend in a world that has seemingly never even managed to invent the knock-knock joke. By half-way through my enjoyment of the deep gameplay mechanics was starting to struggle under the idea of spending yet more time trundling around a place which took everything so seriously. A few changes in tone, perhaps in the side-quests, could have done wonders.

As for the many characters you encounter on your travels and those who will join your party they also suffer from one tragic condition; being unmemorable. Given how beautifully descriptive the writing is when it comes to carefully crafting a scene or detailing the games almost absurd amount of lore its incredibly disappointing to see that the writers so clearly struggled to create meaningful, interesting people to journey with. Their backstories are often interesting and worth attempting to fully uncover, but after spending damn near 70-hours in their presence, more that one would expect to spend with the Mass Effect crew across a single play-through of the whole trilogy, I found that I didnt really care that much about them on a personal level. Indeed, even several hours after meeting a new companion I struggled to remember their name."

[This review by DarthRoxor](http://www.rpgcodex.net/content.php?id=9867) is also very good. 

"Side quests are very disappointing as well, with scant moments of potential. The sad fact of the matter is that the vast majority of them are nothing but shameless FedEx quests. Go there, deliver something, kill someone, as if taken from some random generic quest generator. "

"All the attributes also give some minor adjustments to saving throws, and considering that each defence type is boosted by 2 different attributes, the system simply leads to a very disappointing feeling of sameyness, even among different attribute distributions."

"Options that rely on skills and arent purely for flavour are so rare, you might as well disregard them completely. And even those that do have some effect are very rarely different than just avoiding combat with a trash mob."

"What is even more disappointing is that Obsidian even included short text adventures into PoE that had crazy potential for adding content into the game, but there is only a single instance of one in the game that doesnt feel half-arsed. Otherwise, all text adventures boil down to: 1. Examine [thingy] 2. Use consumable to win 3. Use [athletics/might] to win. 4. Walk away."

"
Which brings us to what possibly surprised and disappointed me the most in PoE  the general writing quality is simply underwhelming. It never reaches any heights, its at best average and at worst abysmal. Everything is overly descriptive, very often just redundant and not leaving much for the players imagination. The majority of texts could easily be trimmed to one-third of their original size, which only tells me that PoE has never seen any editorial work apart from fishing out typos. One of the best examples I can think of is when you first meet Guy McBaddie the main villain, and the game makes sure to tell you at least three times that he is a bearded dude in a ceremonial robe and a fancy hat, even though the description is accompanied by two different illustrations in quick succession."

Also [this review](https://johnswritersblock.com/2015/04/20/pillars-of-eternity-ending-review/) by John Stevenson

"The simple fact of the matter is that the Pillars of Eternity main storyline just never grabbed me. I feel bad that this is going to be mostly a negative review because I absolutely love the ambition on display here. Obsidian shot for the moon on this one and it justdidnt quite get there."

"The sheer amount of information that needs to be conveyed means you get tons of exposition dumped on you a lot. "

"Then theres the backstory youll need to know about the War of Black Trees and War of Broken Stones that lead to the current situation in Dyrwood. Oh and youll need to know about Waidwens Legacy, which means youll need to know about Animancy, which means you need to know about how Souls work in this world, which means you need to know about the Glanfathans

They basically needed to give you a history book to read before playing the game."

"I hate that their huge epic world ultimately becomes a negative to the overall story, but it is. Theres simply so much information you need to know in order to even understand whats happening in the story that at some point you simply stop caring."

The main points are: bland characters, need of tighter editing, and not engaging main story.

I think the main mistake they made was not having a good hook to drag you along the story. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who just started playing... The game is beautiful. 

Compared to DX1, the take downs are not as interesting as the baton IMO. DX1 had great mechanics with the baton/stun prod and crossbow. It's frustrating that my arms run out of power after taking down two enemies.

-Lots of unskippable cutscenes. The dialogue system doesn't allow me to skim through conversations like I'd want to.

To give one example, I did that quest with the guy (Michael?) who has his underground church. I spent longer listening to his unskippable tirade than doing the quest. And I had to pick all 3 options during the conversation for some reason. Why couldn't I just skip it? I got the point already. The actual mission area is very small and doesn't present much of a challenge. I just knock him out and it's over...

That long cutscene at the train station when arriving in Prague could have been much more interesting if they had let the player walk around freely, similar to the HL2 opening sequence.

-Loading times are a bit long. I reload often, so it's annoying.

-I admit that I didn't pay a lot of attention to the story but I find the game a bit confusing. Why do I care about this guy with his fake checkpoint? Why do I need to take the subway to go to that place I need to go? It took me a long time before I realized that's what I had to do.

Compared to DX1, exploring apartments and stuff isn't quite as compelling as being part of a big story. </TEXT>

They're often working alone and just doing this for the love/respect they get from the community and sense of accomplishment. So, when someone steals their stuff, they do the only thing they can, which is yank out their mod.

Of course, it doesn't solve the problem, but it probably makes them feel less abused and taken advantage of. </TEXT>

- Ken Rolston - Lead Designer 
Ken is the lead designer for Morrowind and was involved in creation of Redguard. He is one of the fathers of role-playing and has done work for almost every paper system out there. Ken left Bethesda after Oblivion's release.

And a lot of players are just going to focus on the more mindless aspects of a game: "Oh, you can blow his head off!", and not even notice that the story doesn't make sense. The visual and gameplay elements are just so much more noticeable that the attention ends up going there.

And writing a good RPG with a good story is hard. You have to write in choices for different classes and different moral outlooks. You have to write believable characters with different life philosophies. Not everyone can do that and those who do might not ever get hired by game studios because their skills don't really intersect with game development. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Quick summary:

- Not primarily an RPG. RPG aspect is not core. It's like the feathers that have been glued back on the chicken. The chicken is Explore - Loot - Craft.
- Quests not written by writers, but by level designers, artists, etc. Quests have no depth. Just a simple idea. No consequences. No non-violent alternatives. No ties to the lore. No ties to other quests. Many quests are illogical. Bethesda doesn't explore its ideas - they're just simple fetch quests in the end.
- Some quests are more elaborate, but no branching dialogue. Rewards for dialogue options are caps. USS Constitution is the only quest with stat checks. It should have been just one of many good quests, not the only one.
- Impossible to ask clarifying questions. 
- Dialogue system is pathetic. Dialogue mod shows that most answers are the same - or just the same line rewritten. At that point, why not go fully scripted? If there are no meaningful choices, why pretend? 


- Skyrim: More work is put in the environments than in the stories or characters. 
- None of the recent Bethesda games are really RPGs. There needs to be character building and choices about how you interact with the world. Bethesda either doesn't know this or doesn't want to admit it. Afraid that RPG fans would be angry if they dropped the pretense of being an RPG completely.
- Admits to liking it anyway. Exploring the world is fun.
- Nice vertical design in the city. Great combat arenas. Combat has been improved, but still simple and shallow. Having something like the nanosuit from Crysis would be awesome. Power armor is cool, but clunky plus ticking of fusion core means that he won't use it.
- Ideas for upgradeable options similar to the words of power from Skyrim: Could have had an upgradeable stealth Pip-Boy that explain the ridiculous stealth ability. Or upgradeable suit with cold resistance. Or augmentations that you could pick up from synths.
- On very hard, enemies are insane bullet sponges. Don't drop enough ammo. Leg enemies can have less HP than normal ones.
- Perks: Should have been separated between combat and non combat. Non-combat perks shouldn't cause enemies to level up. 
- Survival mode sucks. Contrary to Dark Souls, death can feel unfair. Repetition is not fun. Also, crash bugs. 


- DLCs have a ton of untapped potential. Far Harbor has creative enemies. Goes on forever about FH. Quests are deeper. Better than main story. </TEXT>

"The Good

An absurd world with equally bonkers characters.

Wonderful presentation of a melodramatic crime drama.

The Bad

The main campaign is slightly tame for a Yakuza.
Might be too much watching and not enough playing for some.

The Ugly

Women are relegated to roles that involve being killed, kidnapped, or ogled in some mini-games.

Time is now the major limit on playing games, not money. A backlog implies that I intend to complete all those games, which will never happen because new games will come out, never mind other forms of entertainments like movies and TV series.

To me, the question is: what do I want to play right now? What do I want to experience? 

Just because I bought a game at some point, it doesn't mean that I'm actually going to play it, even though that was no doubt my intention at the time. Set your priorities and forget about all those other games in your library. </TEXT>

But this is kind of misleading since the median US household income was a [bit higher in 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States#/media/File:US_Real_Household_Median_Income_thru_2014.png). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I still prefer vanilla. 

Noble Skyrim looks amazing in many places, but I don't like the fancy floor tiles they used for High Hroghart for example. It doesn't fit the theme. Same complaint for the Markarth floor. Or the rounded stones used on the Solitude house wall which look fake and out of place to me. 

The vanilla moss covered wooden pillar is the best looking out of the three.

Skyrim 2017 has a couple of fairly ugly textures, like that Solitude moss covered floor which looks toxic.

As for landscapes, Skyrim would need a complete geometry rework to bring it up to modern standards. I don't feel like the texture packs can improve it that much. </TEXT>

That being said, Counterstrike had a VIP mode. The Virtua Cop games had some civilians pop in randomly. GTA obviously has civilians. So, there are examples. Arma features some civilians. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The part about history books was interesting:

"The Cheese and the Worms is interesting because it's about this miller who had really wild personal religious beliefs, strange cosmological beliefs; he thought the world was formed out of cheese and the worms ate through the cheese and became angels, and like all these other things. He's just a miller, and he has these very in-depth thoughts that he probably got by talking to people traveling just because the area he lived in was very well-traveled. He was brought up on charges I think three times and eventually executed for heresy. But what I think is interesting about it, is it shows that even simple people, even peasants, could have actually very deep sort-of ideas and thoughts about the nature of reality and the nature of world, god, the afterlife as opposed to this idea that they're all ignorant and the Church kinda defines everything, and that's all there is. So The Cheese and the Worms is very fascinating.

The Night Battles by the same author is also very interesting because it's about an Agrarian cult, the benandanti, and they are the welfarers, because that's what it means. They were born with a call, and that means they were designated to become these mystic warriors. During certain times of the year, they would enter into dream battles with witches and it was believed that if they won, then their crops would be saved and if they failed, it'd spoil the crops. They were Christian, but when Inquisitors found out about what they were doing, they were like "No, this sounds kinda like you're witches" and they actually convinced the benandanti that they were witches and they were like "Oh wow, you got us." So that's a very interesting thing."

H"ere's one more I read through recently, I think it's called By Sword and Fire by Sean McGlynn and the subtitle is Cruelty and Atrocity in Medieval Warfare. It kind of looks at the aspects of brutality in warfare and how often they were less about being insanely cruel and more about being practical. Like, sieges were very horrible and some of the things that happened during sieges were unbelievably awful, but they had a very specific strategic purpose. Also, a lot of the things that seem really brutal and bloody were done for very specific expedient purposes. Like say, for example, the Battle of Agincourt, at the end of the battle, Henry V ordered the execution of a huge number of captured French soldiers, which is pretty gnarly, until you look at the details and realize all these captured soldiers, who outnumbered them by the way, still had their armor on, were not far away from their weapons, and there was a group of French cavalry that had regrouped and was going to attempt to storm their camp. And so Henry said "Sorry, kill 'em, there's no way we're going to let these guys come in here and retake all their buddies who are still ready to fight." It's horrible, but I guess it's interesting to look through and see how this was the norm, almost everyone engaged in it, usually successful people. For example, King John of England: generally felt as a bad and cruel king. Richard I, he's the greatest, he's the paragon of chivalry, except that he did all these brutal things, but he was victorious. And so we kinda forget about all those horrible, cruel things he did."

"there's a great book by Ken Woodward called Making Saints and it's about how the process of people becoming saints in the public consciousness has changed over the centuries and really it moved from something that was very much a local cult, because they used the term cult of the saint, and then later the Church is like "Hold on, there's a lot of people becoming saints we can't quite keep track of, we're not really sure if they're real or if they were pagans or a dog" in the case of Saint Guinefort which was a very interesting case in France where the story was, a snake had come into the Lord's baby's room, the dog killed the snake, and the Lord ran in and saw blood and the baby crying and killed the dog, and then the servant came in and realized the dog saved the baby, and they buried it and oh, the Church tells us that martyrs are saints. And so St. Guinefort is a dog, whoops, the Church didn't like that.

So the more the Church became involved, then the hagiographies became a means of confirming or documenting the true and verified miraculous properties of this person. Because the Church developed more and more criteria, like okay, it can't just be some guy who's really cool from your area that you celebrate on a certain feast day, like they have to perform miracles, they have to have done this and done that and so over time hagiographies had to check certain boxes for the Church. And they used to go to the, I'm going to get the term wrong, but basically Devil's Advocate which was a real position in the Church, because the Devil's Advocate would say "Okay, I'm going to tear this apart. You say this guy's a saint, I say no, this can be disproved, this isn't true" and so on. And after it got past the Devil's Advocate, it'd go to the Pope for official canonization, put 'em in a book, put 'em on a calendar, they're ready to go. I think a lot of that stuff is really fascinating, especially seeing how over time it changed from something that was a populist thing where all you had to do was say, and eventually the Church is like "Yeah, yeah, these guys have been around for a long time, of course we recognize them as a saint" to being something like "No, no, not until the Pope actually says, you have to go through this very regimented process."" </TEXT>

<TEXT> The "ICE" option is a redesign of the base game.

Features:

" Redesigned stock races; stronger AI opposition; revalued race ability costs (45 picks: 24 base and 21 negatives instead of 10 base and 10 negatives); revamped tech tree; beefed up Guardian; more threatening Antarans and a grand finale when invading the Antaran home world!"

Just edit your Orion2.cfg to exclude base 150 and include ICE-X. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But how many play the game multiple times? Skyrim allows you to try a bit of everything on your first playthrough.

it's not much of a challenge if you're able to be perfect at everything

It takes a long time to level all the skills. Challenge in Skyrim is pretty much set by the player. The game can be as easy or as hard as you want. I don't see this as a big problem. If you want to level all the skills, you'll be investing a lot of time into the game.

Why not if it provides you enough entertainment? How much do you spend per year on luxuries, such as nice clothes, movies, travel, restaurants etc.? Could you really not afford to spend $60 on a game?

According to [this](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/08/very-sad-graph-how-much-americans-have-left-to-spend-after-essentials-today/260606/), a middle class American has $14,400 per year in disposable income.

<TEXT> Let's look at it another way. 

Say a game takes 1M hours of work to make, and each of these hours cost $100 on average. The cost of making the game is $100M.

Who pays for this? If everyone pirates the game, the studio will not get any money. Of course, people will get to enjoy that game anyway (unless it's multiplayer), but then the studio would close and, if that were the general situation, no new games would ever get produced, except by hobbyists working in their spare time.

So you might not feel that you're doing any harm, but if everyone thinks like you, then the games industry will collapse and cool games will not get made. 

I don't know about your personal situation, but many people who pirate have the money to afford buying the games they play. They pirate a game and then go spend $600 on fashionable clothes or $100 on a meal at a fancy restaurant. They could have spent part of that disposable income on the games they spend hundreds of hours playing instead. </TEXT>

I totally agree. It's a problem on all subs, but even moreso here. The downvote button is used to say "I disagree" when it's supposed to be for uninteresting or low effort comments. This leads to the sub being a huge circlejerk. There's almost no indie game coverage for example.

<TEXT> (I hope this is OK now. I had previously linked to the comments section)

My take is that this not the end of the world. Android/Apple products, as well as gaming PCs already have an incremental upgrade approach.

Also, some console generations have lasted about as long. The original Xbox was released in 2001, and the Xbox 360 came only 4 years later in 2005. The 3 years gap between the PS4 and PS4 pro is a bit shorter than the average console generation, but it's not that big of a difference. Last gen was the outlier, with consoles lasting from 2005-2006 until 2013 (7-8 years).

Incremental upgrades make more sense now because the basic tech is a lot more stable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   I can't name a single character or story beat in Crysis. 

Prophet? Island freezing over?

I think Crysis 1 had a decent story. I liked the horror movie vibe at the start of the game and the huge buildup, with a more introspective alien spaceship sequence. Also, the open levels were really fun to play.

But Crysis 2 was a poor followup from a narrative standpoint. They had decent ideas, but the story was confusing. I wasn't sure of who I was and why I was doing things. Why does prophet give you his suit? Who are these  CELL bad guys? How do all the bad guys fit together CELL+Infection+Aliens? And how did we get from the end of Crysis 1 (alien invasion from frozen island) to the start of Crysis 2? This is apparently explained in comic books that no one read. They just did an incredibly poor job from a narrative standpoint. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What makes the game special is that each level is really well crafted, and is made kind of like a [diorama](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/68/1f/b3/681fb383f4710e0c767814d068da6157.jpg). There are plenty of little stories that are told throughout the level. 

The point of the game isn't just to kill your target, but to find all of the ways that you could use to kill him, and also to explore the world. 

One interesting aspect is that you're not constantly shooting everyone, but also blending into the world and observing it from the inside, or even playing a role if only for a brief moment (e.g. being a "sushi chef").

I would love to see a "historical" version of the game, where you travel back to the past, maybe using the pretext of a virtual reality training exercise. It could be awesome to go back to relive a scene from the past, kind of like the movie ["Russian Ark"](https://youtu.be/ZV1kphEEXn8?t=11s) which takes you inside the Hermitage palace in Russia in the 19th century (I think?). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I looked at old reviews for fun:

"You might think that a game like Neverwinter Nights probably isn't very healthy for the gaming industry. After all, this is the sort of game you could easily play for months or even longer. Simply put, once you get into Neverwinter Nights, you'll likely have no need or desire to play another role-playing game for a long time--or any other game for that matter. And while that's unfortunate for any game trying to compete, it's certainly a good thing as far as most gamers should be concerned. They'll find that Neverwinter Nights is indeed the end-all, be-all Dungeons   Dragons RPG that it's been touted to be for the last several years. " - Greg Kasavin from Gamespot

"Neverwinter Nights is undoubtedly one of the most highly-anticipated games of this year. After five years in development, the game is finally done, and to the delight of RPGers around the world, Bioware hasn't left us disappointed. If the shear size of this five-page review scares you, then you'll be happy to know that Neverwinter Nights is good, very good, even brilliant in some aspects. There hasn't been a night for the past week and a half that I haven't stayed up to well into the night (and early, early morn') beating orcs, minotaurs, and hobgoblins -- and I've enjoyed just about every second of it." - Tal Blevins from IGN </TEXT>

If you just want to experience something short that's also one one the best modules in NWN, I recommend checking out [the Hex Coda module](https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/hex-coda-01-canceled-premium-module) by Stefan Gagne. Installation is simple, simply copy things into the right folder (music, movies, etc.) inside your base NWN folder.

"...modern civilization is one of prosperity and safety, with all magic legally controlled by a monolithic business called the Cathedral Corporation. As part of the underground magic movement known as the Hex Coders, every day is a race to develop new arcane technologies and evade persecution by the Cathedral. That alone would be trouble enough, but add the sins of an ancient civilization rising in the present day and you've got more than your fair share of problems. Can you lead the team through this interlocking puzzle across time and space, and avoid getting twenty to life for unauthorized use of magic..?" </TEXT>

<TEXT>  There are so many moving pieces, and it feels organic. I/O really put in a lot of love and effort into this game, and it still gets a lot of negativity because of its episodic structure. But those same people fail to realize just how much depth every level has.

Hitman has some of the best crafted levels I've ever seen. Each level is like a diorama, that really captures the feel of a place. There are lots little details, like conversations between characters, or props, that make each level feel alive.

I find this approach so much better than the open worlds that Ubisoft has been developing for AC and Watch Dogs. In open world games, there's a huge map, but each part gets comparatively little attention. There's a lot of repetition and it becomes kind of a grind after a while. </TEXT>

<TEXT> AC is really conflicted between being a stealth game or an action game. Some assassinations, like the one in Notre Dame in AC Unity, have "hitman-like" assassination options. You can disguise yourself as a priest and kill the target while he's in a confessional. There's also a way to unlock the door on the roof to sneak in through there. But most of the time, missions end in a big fight with the guards. Ubi didn't have the courage to make  a real stealth assassination game by making fighting almost impossible.

Same thing with Watch Dogs. It should be a game about using hacking and stealth, but you can just run in guns blazing. They really should have removed guns from that game, IMO. Aidan is supposed to be a "good guy" but at the same time he's a mass murdering psycho. By contrast, 47 only kills his target. 

The fact that 47 can't go in guns blazing is a great design choice. Hitman doesn't compromise between stealth and action. It's 100% about stealth. AC Unity has both options and as a result, neither of them are really great. The melee fights are not really fun and the stealth is not really well thought out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll try:

- Either go for a focused narrative with no choices (Last of Us), or go back to creating a true RPG (fallout 1, 2 and New Vegas).

- Write design documents. Emil Pagliarulo said in his talk that Beth didn't have any design docs. Seems sloppy and might explain why there's no depth to any of the factions. Why does this faction do this? What are its goals?

In fact, the whole faction design is weak. They didn't spend much time thinking about the different philosophies of the factions and how they approach the world differently.

FO1 and FO2 tried to create a "real" world, with towns, stores and NPCs. There are a few in FO4, but they're quite small. 

Also, there are very few quests that don't involve combat. This is a key difference. A large part of the gameplay in FO1 and FO2 was about talking to people, not fighting. Beth has always thought of dialogue as nothing more than an interruption in the fighting and a kind of wrapping around it to give you a reason to fight.

- Go back to a sane dialogue system. The dialogue auto advances with each answer. You tell 2 stupid jokes in a row and then the dialogue is over. It's weird. It's like the dialogue is just a very thin wrapping around a fetch quest.

There needs to be proper exploratory questions. Like who are you? What do you do here? What are your goals?

- Allow interesting and complex moral choices.

- Cut down on faceless raiders. In FO1 and FO2, outside of some random encounters, all of the "raiders" you met would initiate dialogue. They belonged to a faction or a gang that had its own objectives. Often, you could agree to help them instead of killing them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That was a bit of an oversimplification. The algorithms get more complex. NMS has features like arches and caves. But the basic mesh displacement is never very far.

In the ATV, they talked about "ecosystems". I wonder if these are a subset of biomes that will be randomly scattered about. Having nested specialized PG algorithms seems like the right way to go to create cool planets.

<TEXT> I feel bad for the developers:

" But the journey to ship Sleeping Dogs had a profound effect on the people who made it.

"Several of our best programmers decided to move on and there was some creative turnover, as well," said the same source. "It took several years of hell to ship Sleeping Dogs and many members of the team weren't willing to go through it all again. I was one of the few that stuck around, but even in my case, it took a large toll on my personal life and mental health. Studio culture is a fragile thing and even the loss of a few key people can change the entire dynamic of the workplace.""

They made an amazing game, but I wish they would have had the proper resources to make it without sacrificing their personal lives. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sad that the game was cancelled, but this sounds like a terrible idea:

" Playing as inspector Jane Teng, you would "manage the police force and try to control territories" from your mobile device. If you owned Sleeping Dogs 2, your choices in the mobile game influenced what's happening in the city, the gangs in control, etc. If you summoned a police patrol on a mobile device, you'd see that in-game as a helicopter flying by. If you didn't own Sleeping Dogs 2, the hope was to craft an enjoyable free-to-play game that pointed you towards the console game."

This part is more interesting, but I'm doubtful that it would have added much to the game:

"It was more than that, though. United Front Games envisioned a sprawling metagame it dubbed "massively single player," where actions you took in your gamebusting a crime, taking a bribewould adjust city dynamics in other players' games. The specifics hadn't been worked out yetthis was all theoreticalbut players could focus their efforts on cleaning up specific parts of town as a community and turn crime-ridden places into livable neighborhoods.

This would be achieved by "using the cloud saves of all players to determine the global neighborhood crime levels across all games, and then mapping that crime to the difficulty level in policing those neighborhoods in the individual's games."" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me take a stab at it:

1) no music. Music makes game footage more exciting.

2) Environments are boring. Gold Horizon looked ten times better.

3) Space combat is underwhelming. Players in space are sitting ducks. They should have nitrogen jetpacks propelling them around or something. The windows look bad. They're way too thin for space station windows. It feels wrong.

4) Not epic enough. The objectives are fine for an alpha. But it's not battlefield, or overwatch, or call of duty, or Planetside 2. Now obviously, they can't directly compete with those games either.

5) No special flavor. They need something or some things that make their FPS different from what's already out there. Personally, I'd love to see a revival of Enemy Territory/Quake Wars style gameplay. But that's just me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing is they rewrote pretty much everything in Cryengine to have unified 1st and 3rd person animations. This was one of CR's big goals and I've always been a little bit skeptical. It's really hard not to get the animations to look stupid. And what are the benefits? None really. 

I feel like the dev time would have been much better spent polishing the actual game mechanics. CR seems to want to do everything "properly", but there's a reason why most games don't bother. it's because there's a low/negative return on investment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I admit that I had never bothered to look at this in detail and didn't even know what libretro was. Here's my understanding of it. From the website, "Libretro is a simple API that allows for the creation of games and emulators." "Programs get ported to this library and can then be run with any libretro-compatible frontend." The main feature seems to be to provide a simple way to create cross platform compatible programs. This is a product created for developers. Your main goal seems to be to promote the use of this new library so that it will be used by as many games and emulators as possible. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is what I gather from your reply to my post.

RetroArch is the official reference frontend to the libretro library. It's used to launch games and emulators created with libretro. This is a product created for end users. 

What are you goals for this project? It's not a commercial project, so your goal is not to maximize profits. It seems that you main goal would be to make this as popular as possible within the developer community. Am I right that your ultimate goal would be for 1000s of games and emulators to use this library?

Assuming that this is the case, it would then seem logical that you would want to create a UI that's as intuitive as possible so that users have an easy time launching games and emulators.

I understand not wanting to abstract away the cores. These are the products that you want to promote, like the games on a game console. I don't think that this prevents you, however, from implementing many other usability improvements.

I read a bit about your design philosophy. You say that you want to "Strive for advanced power-user features while still being accessible for inexperienced beginner endusers." This seems like a worthy goal to me. 

But I also see a lack of clarity in some aspects of your other goals. On your front page, you explain what libretro is: "Libretro is a simple but powerful development interface..." but you don't say what RetroArch "is", you say what it's commonly know for: "RetroArch is most popularly known for being a program with which you can play many emulators and games". But what is it? What do you want it to be? What is your ultimate goal for this project? Who is it for? I think this is something worth thinking about.

You talk a lot about features "It has features few other dedicated games / emulators have, such as". But features are not what defines a product. You have to think about who you're making this for, and why you're making it.

If your goal is to make libretro as popular as possible, it would make sense to have a Frontend that's simple and easy to use. If users can't easily launch libretro games and emulators, then libretro will not become popular.

You say that "it tries to strike a clear balance between being a typical '90s power user program AND being the more 'accessible, dumbed down' thing that it seems today's audiences expect." These goals don't have to be at odds. You can make it simple to use, and have power options for power users. Even power users appreciate an intuitive design. Maybe you can start by finding little things that you can improve to make the UI more useable.

I hope that you don't find this too arrogant, but "dev centric" design is super common in open source projects, and I see some of it here. Devs will design programs for themselves and other devs and not really care about whether their grandma, or their little brother, can use them or not. I see this when you say "Our project does not centre around playing emulated games, it centres around an API". The goal is to cater to developers, not users. But if you think about the wider perspective, devs will not come if there are no users. In the end, dumb users are always important because they drive the project. It's really cool for devs when what they make is downloaded millions of times by users all around the world.

Anyway, just my 2 cents. I know that this is a free project and that what you contribute to it comes from your own passion. You have no obligation to anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here are some things about the UI that seem wrong to me, although I'm not an expert and I may be wrong. I'll look at it through these principles: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_user_interface_design

"The structure principle: Design should organize the user interface purposefully, in meaningful and useful ways based on clear, consistent models that are apparent and recognizable to users, putting related things together and separating unrelated things, differentiating dissimilar things and making similar things resemble one another. "

When I open the program, the first thing I see is the "Space Invader" or "Retroarch Menu". Then there is the "Gear" or "Configuration menu". It's not obvious to me what's the difference between these two. Also, there's a "configurations" menu inside the RA menu. It's already confusing.

The first interaction that the program suggests to me is to "Load Core". I try this and see a list of Options: "Download Core, Start Remote RetroPad" "Start Video Processor".  This is confusing because as a first time user, I want to play a game. How do I play a game from there? What's my path from there?

If I back out, then I can "Load Content" But what is content? What is "a core"? It gives me an option to find a file on my hard drive? Is that what I should do? It seems like it would take a long time if I have to do that every time.

You might think this is not what I'm supposed to do, but since these are the first two options that I see, as a new user, these are the first options that I'll try. 

Then I see "Online Updater". Oh, that's probably to update RA to the latest version. I can ignore that.

If I go back and look at structure as a whole, I see "information" before "help". As a user who wants help, I will probably tend to click on information first because it's there. But this is something for technical users only and really doesn't need to be presented as one of the basic options. 

Configurations also seems like an option for advanced users. Netplay seems like a specific feature for a few players.

Maybe the first Menu should be designed so that it shows the correct interaction for 99% of users first. That probably means having scan directory first. Options for developers and advanced users should be hidden away somewhere else. New users should intuitively pick the correct option. The interface should guide them smoothly towards the correct path.

What most users want is probably: 1) scan games 2) play game 3) configure controls 4) Adjust volume 5) mess around with gimmick options, like trying shaders, new cores etc. This is the cherry on the top. RA should be designed around the first four core interactions, not the fifth one. Ideally, all the technical problems should be abstracted. No technical options should be visible.

The corresponding principles are:

"The visibility principle: The design should make all needed options and materials for a given task visible without distracting the user with extraneous or redundant information. "

"The simplicity principle: The design should make simple, common tasks easy, communicating clearly and simply in the user's own language, and providing good shortcuts that are meaningfully related to longer procedures."

Oh and it should be easy to switch between cores, something that's not even possible through the GUI right now. so if you choose the wrong core, then you're toast.

"The tolerance principle: The design should be flexible and tolerant, reducing the cost of mistakes and misuse by allowing undoing and redoing, while also preventing errors wherever possible by tolerating varied inputs and sequences and by interpreting all reasonable actions."

Also, going by the simplicity principle, I probably shouldn't even have to choose a core. Ideally, RA would be setup in such a way that it would "just work" when I click on a game. RA would launch the core that's most appropriate for my system. 99% of users probably don't care about what core they're using, as long as it works.

Once I launch a game, RA breaks the tolerance principle. There's no obvious way for me to go back to the previous state (the big menu), or to change the controls or any options. What I do is that I have to close and relaunch the app. I can mute the audio, but not change the volume. I can't apply shaders or anything. Ideally, all of the options given by the core that is running should be exposed in the top menu. I should be able to easily change my controller configuration, go back to the big menu, or apply a shader, then turn it off.

There is an option (that I hadn't found previously to be honest), called menu toggle. This is not intuitive. I never tried that one before and I'm now seeing the menu for the first time. Let me try "shaders". A bunch of complicated text. Ideally, I would like to just see a visual representation of what effects the shaders will have presented as tiles. Instead of having ten text options, it would be so much easier to have big pictures that I click on to toggle.  If I click on "controls", I see a bunch of text that almost makes me want to vomit. What I really want to see is something like this: http://openemu.org/img/controls-prefs.png A big picture of a controller! That's so much more intuitive.

This is just a naive attempt at critiquing the UI, but I hope it helps in some way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The reason is that good design is not something that's easy to understand or explain. When something is well designed, it just works intuitively and we don't know why. When it's badly designed it's frustrating to use, but we don't know why either. Why can my grandma use an iPhone but not Windows or Linux? It's not an easy question and I don't have a precise answer.

Ideally, you would have a Human computer interaction specialist who would do a usability study and point out specific flaws in the interface. But it's not something that just anyone can do. I understand that it can be frustrating to have people complain about your interface without being able to point out why. I'll make another post to try and give you some pointers. Here it is: https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/5dr4ip/having_so_many_problems_with_retroarch/da6xipv

<TEXT> I guess he just took on too much. Having one guy in charge of everything is okay for a small shop, not a big one, and not for a 3 major franchises for so long. Also, creative burnout is real. A creator needs downtime to read, see the world and absorb new ideas. (didn't watch the interview yet)

I think that Blizz under Metzen suffered a bit from what Miyazaki said about Anime creators. That they just reference other animes and stop caring about the real world. Blizz had just stopped telling real stories.

<TEXT>  One of the shallowest and watered down games ever made that calls itself an rpg. 

That's true. Because it's barely an RPG. Bethesda created a very nice world. The art in FO4 is amazing. They just ruined it with their stupid dialogue system.

This is a bit of rant but... The "4 choices" system they implemented in FO4 doesn't work at all and is often ridiculous. You can't even ask logical questions like "Who are you? What are you doing here? What is this Institute you keep talking about?". If you ask a clarification question, the conversation will advance most of the time, meaning that it's treated like a yes. There's very little opportunity to ask questions. The sarcastic responses are often a bit out of place and also advance the dialogue. You can't always tell what you're going to say based on the simplified response you see. This is also a problem in recent Bioware games. There are plot holes and a lot of the game's big questions are not answered at all.

There's also no roleplaying. You are either a soldier (male) or a lawyer (female). (Not that you get to use your lawyering skills much. You're basically just a female soldier anyway.) You can't decide on your origin story or shape who you are through your choices in the game.

There are basically no choices. You can't choose anything in the game, except at the end, but even these choices are not very well thought out.

Every dialogue choice in the game really comes down to "yes" or "not now, I'll accept this quest later".

As [Joseph Anderson](https://youtu.be/A34poZ6paGs) said in his analysis, it would probably have been better if they had created a true narrative focused game like the Last of Us and removed all illusion of choice. That's what they did anyway, but added 3 poorly worded ways to say yes to maintain a very thin illusion of "choice". This would have allowed them to focus their resources and create a much more polished experience. 

It's obvious that they want to create a movie-like experience in their games and are moving away from roleplaying. It's the overall trend in the industry. Most AAA games not made by Bioware are like movies. And even Bioware has kind of been moving there too.

Of course, I'd prefer if they went back to an unvoiced protagonist and a dialogue system similar to New Vegas that allows the player to ask questions and make choices. But I doubt they'll go in that direction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fallout 3 was a lot worse. It was ugly and green. Everything was separated by loading screens. There was no life and no logic to the world. No farms. You had absurd choices like a) "destroy a city for no reason" or b) "don't". The final sequences in the game had you watching other characters talk and do things while you were on the sidelines. [Spoiler](#s "There's also a silly forced sacrifice at the end, which should have been avoidable given how many ways to resist radiation there are.")

Fallout 4 is a lot better. I think they really tried to improve on Fallout 3, and they mostly succeeded except for the story/dialogue system which they made even worse.

I think that people have mostly forgotten FO3 by now though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Quests markers are an eternal battle. But they do make it much easier if you pick up the game after a while. 

Some older games, like Star Control II, or Morrowind, made finding your quest destination a puzzle to be solved. It's more intellectually challenging and immersive. But it requires dedication and patience. Modern games are more about instant gratification. </TEXT>

"I hate that their huge epic world ultimately becomes a negative to the overall story, but it is. Theres simply so much information you need to know in order to even understand whats happening in the story that at some point you simply stop caring"

"What they should have done instead is make their story a character driven human drama, because thats where the writing really shines. "

https://johnswritersblock.com/2015/04/20/pillars-of-eternity-ending-review/

" The way the setting at large is presented to the player leaves a lot to be desired. PoE suffers a lot from its writers being obviously very proud of what theyve done, so they make sure to tell you how awesome their setting is at every step  when an NPC starts talking about a distant place or a past event, brace yourself for a gigantic encyclopaedic infodump filled with dozens of alien names, regardless of whether the NPC is a commoner or a historian. This kind of exposition should be in the cyclopedia section of the games journal, not in every second friggin dialogue."

"
Which brings us to what possibly surprised and disappointed me the most in PoE  the general writing quality is simply underwhelming. It never reaches any heights, its at best average and at worst abysmal. Everything is overly descriptive, very often just redundant and not leaving much for the players imagination. The majority of texts could easily be trimmed to one-third of their original size, which only tells me that PoE has never seen any editorial work apart from fishing out typos."

To those negatives, I'll add a lack of humor. They forgot to make the game funny and poke fun at their own world and characters.

<TEXT> By "deep", I think that most people mean a deeply involving story.

But maybe videogames lack depth in general. I was just reading this:

"When my friends talk about why they don't like video games, they are talking about three things. The most important thing is that they think video games lack depth. They say things like, "Unlike books/films/podcasts, with video games I don't learn anything or change as a person"."http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-07-video-games-are-boring

Planescape Torment would be one of the few games where you can "learn something or change as a person". Most games are fairly mindless when you get down to it, but there are exceptions, such as possibly Mass Effect, or KOTOR2. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One thing that I respect Chris Avellone for is his creativity.

For example, his version of Fallout 3 was supposed to have another party going around completing quests. It really turns on its head the idea that you're the hero doing everything and solving all the world's problems:

"JMR: Van Buren was supposed to have another party in the world that would wander around and complete quests. Can you tell us how that was supposed to work?

MCA: Yeah, basically what they would do is they would go to alternate locations, and they had their own agenda path they were trying to follow to accomplish certain objectives. And the trick with them is each one of the rival party members actually had a separate agenda, which they didn't fully share with everybody else in the party. So sometimes they would do certain things at locations where it worked with one of their agendas but nobody else's, but the other guys wouldn't know about it, so you could use that against them, where you're like, Well you know that guy in that location left a note for us to follow you, and they're like, Oh my god! Are you a traitor? [shooting sounds] But... it was basically a very heavily scripted NPC mechanic, where we were like, we're trying to increase reactivity and the sense the world was moving on. So, when the player characters would go to one location and do a bunch of stuff, they would be notified that something else was happening in the location and those guys would take care of the quests in an area or conquer that location, and you were like, Oh, shit, like, We gotta move. But it was all intended to give the sense that something else was happening in the world without waiting for you."

Here were his very unique ideas for Planescape:Torment: 
[Spoiler](#s ""For Torment, I knew I wanted the following moments: waking up from the death screen, seeing the outside of the Mortuary, the idea of encountering a pregnant alley and helping it give birth, the concepts for Fhjull and Trias and what it would be like to talk to otherworldly creatures like them with their peculiar outlooks, a floating skull, a puritan succubus, a buried village, and the idea of having a conversation with your own mortality on a plane of the dead. With those elements in mind, I asked Okay, so how do I get the player to all those moments, and then started fleshing out the paths to get there."")

I don't think that anyone else would have come up with that.

He's also had some less good ideas, like getting rid of talking heads conversations.

<TEXT> Contrary to fans, Chris Avellone doesn't take Fallout too seriously. He holds no reverence for Fallout 2. I think he's right in that regard. FO2 is far from perfect and had many fairly stupid things thrown in. Which is also what makes it funny.

And it's clear that Fallout wasn't "all about the story" in his mind. Combat was important too.

He does talk smack about Obsidian's management though:

"there's too many other problems at the higher managerial level to ever consider stepping back, especially when you could make a step in a direction that mattered for the franchise. Even leads at Obsidian have said as much (most after departing), and they told me they felt helpless in their roles to do what they felt was the right decision."

"From an outside perspective, however, it appears when Bethesda likes working with a studio or see their potential, they seem to buy them (Arkane). They didn't buy Obsidian, though, even though Obsidian is eager to be bought based on recent interviews. It might be for the best - I don't know what would happen to the devs if Obsidian was bought, but the upper management would likely come out okay with that exit strategy." </TEXT>

<TEXT> For those who don't want to click through:

"So I poked around at all the textures in the SE version to see if they had changed. I PM'd Arthmoor about this, but I figure I'll post it here for others to see.

Bethesda decided to upscale a large amount of textures, doubling their size. Upscaling a texture from 512x512 to 1024x1024 or whatever is generally considered a bad plan because all it does is blur things or add noise and not actually improve image quality. Bethesda has used a sort of automated upscale-noise-filtering system to make the textures a bit more...noisy. It does make them ever so slightly less blurry, but it also adds dithering, which isn't good. I suppose it is a toss up on which is better. Here's some comparisons: [rug](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/105519679/SEvs2011-TextureUpscale-Rug.jpg), [bear pelt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/105519679/SEvs2011-TextureUpscale-BearPelt.jpg).

For reference, the original release (with HighRes DLC) had 898 architecture files for 825mb. SE has 898 architecture files for 1.91gb. So yeah...technically I should update all my vanilla texture edits to use these new "high res" textures...but like I said, I don't believe any of these larger textures are actually from high res art sources.

Overall, the textures take up about 4gb more space in the SE version. I assume Bethesda increased the texture size mostly because the PS4/XB1 have plenty of texture RAM available." -Clanfriend </TEXT>

This is exactly what they're going to do. People complained for years about Cities in Motion 2's simulation and it never got fixed. We only got aesthetic DLCs.

Colossal Order only has 15 employees in total. It's an indie studio, not a major game developer, so I don't think they can afford to work on things that will not immediately make them money (or at least that's how they see it).

Cities Skylines was successful, but the profits probably went to Paradox, with CO being paid a fixed fee. </TEXT>

It's not clear that Microsoft has even made money with its Xbox division. The first Xbox didn't sell too well, Xbox 360 did but the RROD was very expensive, Xbox One is not doing too well again.

If Nintendo entered the field with a PS4 clone, how many would buy that? They might be better off becoming a software company in that case. </TEXT>

"After teasing investors for more than a year with a promise of a whole new way to experience hardware and software together, the Switch was a big let down, said Amir Anvarzadeh, Singapore-based head of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc.

In an era of smart devices where you can play games anywhere, I dont think conceptually it is evolutionary enough, Anvarzadeh said. The fact you can plug it in at home and take it away and play, so what? We were expecting a little bit more of Nintendo magic sprinkled, and I didnt see it.

"I love the concept of Switch, but thats what it feels like: a concept, said Elliot King, 33, who works in foreign affairs and lives in Tokyo. I wont be picking one up personally.

After teasing investors for more than a year with a promise of a whole new way to experience hardware and software together, the Switch was a big let down, said Amir Anvarzadeh, Singapore-based head of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc.

In an era of smart devices where you can play games anywhere, I dont think conceptually it is evolutionary enough, Anvarzadeh said. The fact you can plug it in at home and take it away and play, so what? We were expecting a little bit more of Nintendo magic sprinkled, and I didnt see it. The market is right about selling it off.

Fridays plunge was even worse than the markets reaction to the Wii U console, which came out after the Wii and was itself an attempt to combine the experience of playing on a big screen and a handheld device.

The Switchs portable feature also puts it at odds with Nintendos recent embrace of smartphones. 

It really depends on the games, said Glover. Lets see what kind of content Nintendo comes out with, but just the gimmicky crossover system isnt enough to get me excited.

How well the new hardware does may depend largely on the price, according to Macquarie Securities analyst David Gibson. In a research report last week, he estimated the device would retail for about $250 to compete with the PS4s $299 price tag. Gibson wrote that the new hardware is likely to disappoint in terms of revolutionary features, but that a strong lineup of gaming titles will help to fuel demand at launch. He estimated Nintendo will sell 2.5 million units in its first month and an additional 10.6 million units by March 2018."

I've highlighted the more negative parts. But, it seems like this is really a luxury handheld gaming device. It will be competing against mobile phones and tablets. Will people want to carry this on top of their phone? </TEXT>

<TEXT> For those who can't access the article, here's the most relevant part:

"Nintendos shares, which have risen more than 50 per cent since the start of the year on renewed faith that the Kyoto-based company was poised for a smartphone and console-based revival, shed more than 6 per cent on Friday morning. 

That more than reversed Thursdays 3.3 per cent climb amid the buzz surrounding the stock after Nintendo alerted the gaming world that the video was coming. 

One concern, said analysts, was still the question of the machines price. Serkan Toto, a games industry consultant who commented shortly after the release of the video, said that for the Switch to make an impact in a market where Sonys PlayStation 4 already has a global installed base of more than 40m users, it had to come in at or below the price of other consoles now well into their stride. 

They must find a way to release the Switch at US$299 to stand a chance; thats the threshold. Its not impossible by offering the device in multiple versions, said Mr Toto, who added that Nintendo still appeared to be struggling to define its target audience. Who else but diehard Nintendo fans will buy the Switch? he said.

Jay Defibaugh, a games industry analyst at CLSA, said the video left investors with a lot of unknowns that were now being reflected in the share price. The video did not seem to show the Switch having any touchscreen capabilities, he added, which raised the question of whether it will be able to play augmented-reality games such as the phenomenally popular Pokmon Go. 

No one is saying that the concept is a disaster, but expectations for this launch had been very high. Now that it is out there, we are seeing the exhaustion of what has been a share price catalyst in recent months, so today has been an easy moment for some to take profits, said Mr Defibaugh." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Any speculation on whether the console cradle actually has hardware in it, or is everything running on that tiny tablet that looks to be mostly screen?

Probably not. Having additional coprocessors would be a nightmare. It would be possible to have a more powerful SoC inside the base, but then it would double the cost of one of the central components of the console. So, realistically, it's probably mostly a charging dock with connections to the TV.

It might also contain a hard drive, or active cooling to enhance the tablet's performance when docked. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Will probably be the X2. There is some speculation that it's similar to [the newly announced Parker SoC](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoNX/comments/4z80yo/nvidia_finally_revealed_tegra_parker_x2_with_more). It has 1.5 TFLOPS using FP16. The chip will probably be slightly different, as this is aimed at cars.

Edit: While I couldn't find any hard numbers on Wii U performance, it's almost certain that the X2 will be more powerful. Estimates put the Wii U around [0.35 TFlops](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpudb/1903/wii-u-gpu) or less, although there are no completely reliable numbers. The PS4 has an estimated 1.8 TFlops vs 1.3TFlops for the Xbox One. Keep in mind that TFlops are not a completely accurate measure of performance.

Edit2: You're right that another possibility is that it will be X1 based (Maxwell) and similar to the [Nvidia Shield TV](http://www.notebookcheck.net/Nvidia-Shield-Android-TV-Review.166556.0.html) or [Google Pixel C](http://www.notebookcheck.net/Google-Pixel-C-Tablet-Review.158868.0.html). They used an X1 clocked at 2.0 and 1.9Ghz with 3Gigs of ram. Given Nintendo's reputation for using weak hardware (2009 GPU used in 2012 Wii U), the X1 might be a more realistic guess after all. But who knows?

Edit 3: [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/what-we-know-and-what-we-can-guess-about-nintendo-switchs-insides/) is reporting on rumors that point to an X2. Eurogamer also has an [article](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2016-nintendo-nx-mobile-games-machine-powered-by-nvidia-tegra) pointing in the same direction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, it's basically a handheld with a dock? I'm guessing that the dock might contain some additional hardware that allows games to run at higher resolutions.

The games shown were "Wii U" quality, so it's possible that the console is roughly as powerful as the Wii U, in a handheld configuration. They might have more powerful hardware located inside the dock, which takes over when the handheld is docked. This hardware can probably render the game at higher resolutions, higher framerates and maybe with extra AA or AF, but I doubt that it will go beyond that. The game has to be able to seamlessly switch from docked to mobile, so it would be difficult to have too many extra features on the docked hardware. Maybe increased draw distances, or different shaders? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Those were really bad design decisions IMO. High ground mechanics are intuitive and make the game much more fun. They probably should have kept some sort of unit selection limit, which had always been a design choice in previous games. The high DPS and high stackability of units made single deathballs the most powerful formations. And they completely did away with all the micro behind controlling units like mutas. The game could have been so much better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I totally agree but I would call these design choices, not balance. They based their balance patches on pro tournaments. 

I didn't know that they did that for casuals. I think both were big mistakes. Colossus are boring units once you get past the cool factor. Little ability to micro and go to unit in a very high proportion of matches (at least in WoL). The high ground change made the game much less interesting. I don't really see how those changes help casuals. Pros will be better anyway. There's still a high skill ceiling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to [Tilt Brush](http://steamspy.com/app/327140) sales data (given for free with Vive), the Vive has sold around 155,000 units since being released in April 2016. 

We don't have exact numbers for the Rift, but we know that Oculus shipped 175,000 development kits. According the [Steam HW survey](http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey), Oculus has a 30% market share vs 60% for the Vive. So that would put the Oculus CV1 sales at around 75,000. If you add the DK sales, that would put them at 250,000. You decide whether or not that's fair. Steam says that the DK2 still has a 10% market share while the DK1 is at 0%, so it's presumably not being used anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Overmind?

The way I understand it is:

Original story: Overmind wants to attack humans and assimilate Kerrigan to gain psionic powers to defeat the Protoss.

New Story: Overmind wants to assimilate Kerrigan to free himself from Amon's influence who makes him want to kill the Protoss. The Overmind's plan is actually not to destroy the Protoss but to destroy Amon who seeks to destroy all life, including the Zerg. So actually, in the original Starcraft, the Overmind really wanted to be friends with the Terran and the Protoss and unite against Amon, but it just didn't appear that way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> BW is a better game, IMO. It doesn't devolve into deathball vs. deathball. Positioning is more important so there's a stronger tactical element. 

And it's more fun to watch. Good storms have a real meaning and suspense, or reaver hits. It's hard to control your units perfectly. It's a bit like watching a good football player juggle the ball. SC2 was a bit too predictable and players got it "right" almost all the time, or, at the opposite, in LoTv, the game became a mess of multipronged attacks. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The Overmind? That was Amon's doing. 

The original explanation for the Overmind was quite different, and a lot more interesting. It was essentially a Xel' Naga experiment gone wrong:

"The Xel'Naga, remembering all too well that their failure with the Protoss was a result of pushing the sentinence of the fledgling species too quickly, decided to follow a different path with the burgeoning Zerg. Attempting to waylay the potential hazards of differing egos, the Xel'Naga structured the collective sentinence of the Zerg into a unified, amalgamated 'Overmind'. The Overmind coalesced into a semi-sentinent being that represented the primary drives and instincts of all the Zerg strains. As time passed, the Overmind developed the rudiments of personality and advanced intellect."

"The Overmind, while slowly expanding itself into the voids of space, became aware of the mighty Xel'Naga world-ships hovering ominously above the skies of Zerus. The Xel'Naga, having kept a constant watch on the Overmind, were horrified to find that it had actually severed their psychic link, effectively hiding itself from their view. With its need to consume driving its minions into a lustful frenzy, the Overmind launched the now space-faring Zerg swarms at the unsuspecting Xel'Naga. The ancient race did what they could to stem the tide of the ever-advancing Zerg onslaught, but in the end their efforts were in vain. Wave after wave of Zerg swarms hammered the reinforced hulls of the Xel'Naga's ships with no signs of abatement. Within only a few hours the Zerg overran the defenses of their creators and laid waste to the Xel'Naga fleet.

As the greater whole of the Xel'Naga race was consumed by the raging, genetic whirlwind of the Zerg, the Overmind gained the knowledge and insights of its masters. The Overmind processed thousands of sentient beings into itself, causing it to grow far more powerful than it had ever imagined. It learned the secrets of the Khaydarin Crystals, and began to incorporate the energies of these Crystals into its own. Through the intimate knowledge of evolution and proto-genetic physiology gained from the Xel'Naga, the Overmind was able to increase the level of sentience in many of the higher Zerg strains, while still keeping them fully under its control." [source](http://archive.rpgclassics.com/subsites/starcraft/zhistory.shtml)

Edit: Also, I think this is a pretty good example of why the writing wasn't always bad. The old Chris Metzen, who wrote this, created a pretty good story. The Xel' Naga created this superorganism, the Zerg, then lost control over their creation. In the new, retconned version of the story, the cookie-cutter villain, Amon, created the overmind, and gave it a secret directive to kill the Protoss, so it just appeared to want to kill them. It's just extremely convoluted and a bad story. At some point, I think Metzen just started to copy the same story everywhere. It was all about Good vs. Evil, with a corruption story. Anything that didn't fit that mold was retconned. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  If it hadn't been for SC1's great custom multiplayer with maps like BGH, DBZ Mods, Hero Line Wars and whatnot, the competitive scene would never have lasted as long as it did. These custom maps kept the players engaged in playing the game, however they liked playing it. I hated SC2 multiplayer in contrast - that shit gave me ladder anxiety. I liked watching competetive games between StarCraft pros, but what I didn't like was playing a game where I felt I had a gun pointed at my head. 

Their biggest mistake was probably making 1v1 the center of the experience. Yes, that's how the pros played BW, but how many casual players liked 1v1? It's stressful. All the other popular multiplayer games are FFA or team battles. </TEXT>

PoE's story had a lot of what Bethesda calls "Bore Bombs", long exposition that just bores the player out of his mind. 

It had very little in the way of an engaging story. Good writing should hook the player emotionally and get him to care about the characters. I didn't develop an emotional bond with my characters or with the world.

PoE's world was a vanilla high-fantasy world, with nothing much to distinguish it from any other generic fantasy world. Tyranny's world has a unique twist (evil world). Apparently, it also received more of Chris Avellone's input, before he left.

<TEXT> Short summary:

- K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid.

- Great games are played, not made. This means: Play your own stuff. / harder to do than it sounds: ideas can be great on paper but suck in-game. 

- Strong central theme

- The most central theme in FO4 is suspicion (is the person next to me an android?) - but they didn't realize it until later

- Write what you know. Miyazaki said that Anime sucks now because creators don't observe the world anymore. In order to create something, you have to know something.

- We don't have a lot of design documentation. After FO3, found that design docs quickly became outdated - not worth maintaining.

- We start big - Want to write a great American novel. But these are novels, not interactive fiction. You have to keep to player in mind. Players are not going to see your story because they'll spend 30 hours building shacks (and they know and love this). 

- We needed to redo our dialogue system. Drew inspiration from Mass Effect and Telltale games. 

- Voiced protagonist: controversial choice within the studio. 

- 4 buttons: A: positive; B: Negative; Y: Question; X:Neutral.

- At first, dialogue not skippable. People within the studio were going crazy. We create stories, but players don't want to hear them.

- Nightmare for designers to write 4 answers to everything.

- Dialogue can be written quickly. Dangerous thing, because we don't want players listening to dialogue all the time. They want to avoid what they call "Bore Bombs". That's every time a giant bunch of text is dumped on the player. 

- Try to tell their story through the environment instead.

- How to start a quest? Example of a quest that starts after witnessing a bar fight. More interesting.

- Always keep the player in mind. You don't have to watch the story. You can experience it. </TEXT>

In Pillars of Eternity, a single player RPG, I was frustrated when I picked a bad skill and was stuck with it. I'm not going to play the game 10 times as each class. If I pick a class, I'd like to be able to experiment with the different skills.

But I agree that for a multiplayer game, D3's instant skill swapping was too generous. It made the game only about the items and removed the idea of character builds. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It was sorta a waste of budget if anything... They didn't really improve the writing enough to make it worth while.

The reason why they do this is because some players don't like reading the dialogue in their head. Also, it's "more cinematic". I would like to go back to the more complex text only dialogues, but games have been moving in the opposite direction. They tend to be dumber, action-oriented, and "more visual".

FO4 is a good example. Bethesda doesn't care about the dialogues so much. They're just used as a wrapping around quests. Accept the quest through a short dialogue, then get a short dialogue when you come back. They don't care at all about roleplaying, which is what FO1 and 2 were about.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm glad that they made this decision and also that they showed us their thought process.

All these "cons" create artificial deadlines and are accompanied by really high expectations. It's great if you can please your fans, but sometimes you just can't do it.

The long term health of the project and of developers is more important. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I took the menu option out because people ended up not knowing how to exit fullscreen once they entered it. If you find it in the hotkey menu, then you see/set the hotkey how you like and know what it is.

How about also having the common alt+enter as a shortcut? Higan can easily be alt+tabbed out of, so I don't see how getting stuck in fullscreen could be a major problem. You could also have the menu show up when hovering the mouse on top of the screen.

I do a bad job by not including them with the emulator though.

Yes, please include them! I didn't know that they existed. Like many other users, I'm lazy. I don't want to have to look them up or figure out how to install them.

Also, could you write the import .log to Higan's main folder? A bit annoying that the log is lost or written somewhere obscure.

I also have a built-in cheat database (courtesy of mightymo) which has basically every known cheat code already built-in. Literally tens of thousands of codes in there right out of the box. You don't have to go browse shady ad-laden sites that give you codes for the wrong revision or wrong region of your game.

Sorry, you're right. It works quite well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I couldn't get titles requiring chips like the c4x to run in Higan. There's probably a way but it didn't work. SNES9x loads Megaman X2 directly.

Also, I find Higan not to be intuitive. You need to import games first. I couldn't find the fullscreen option. Turns out that it's hidden as a "hotkey" but not available in the menu...

SNES9X is more convenient if you just want to play a game.

Edit: Snes9x also supports a bunch of scaling filters out of the box. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't expect much from the demo, as I hadn't followed the hype. I thought it was pretty neat.

I think that there's a kind of "expectation treadmill" that was built up around SC. Fans are expecting to have their mind blown, time after time, because it has happened before. However this demo comes very soon after the GAMESCOM demo. Developers are probably crunching to create them. I worry that there are too many demos shown and that the expectations are too high each time. I wouldn't judge the state of SC based on the lack of a mind blowing demo. It's in large part a distraction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The combat wasn't especially great. They had too many skills that could have been merged, like 3 persuasions skills.

Graphically, even the Director's cut doesn't look very good. WL2 failed to create a living world with an interesting atmosphere.

The UI design isn't very good. At higher resolution, everything is very [small](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/az3npcaimao5osse9yt7.jpg), but it's a problem even at lower resolution. A lot of the "action" in the game takes place on the typewriter where all the game text scrolls. It's small and hard to read and hidden in the bottom right corner. 

This is one of the worst game design choices in the game IMO. [Old Infinity engine games](http://killapenguin.com/227/gallery/medium/planescape/planescape-torment-292.jpg) made you read a lot but they had nice clear text that took up a third of your screen. WL2 makes you squint at this tiny part of your monitor.

Also, the UI design in general, the icons, etc. is pretty bad.

But the worst is the writing. It has a redneck vibe and tries to be dark. It's just not very good. 

Fallout 2 was funny and at the same time tried to portray characters and factions in a believable way. It then layered philosophical themes on top of that. 

I've watched the WL3 trailer and it seems like they're heading in the same direction. If you think [this](https://youtu.be/xxYUgRdp0EE?t=39s) is interesting dialogue, then you'll like the game. </TEXT>

I think you have a point. Here's [someone sawing an alien in half](https://youtu.be/PcPklMs4NtE?t=11m41s) in the game. Right after, a big monster comes out of the ground. 

Games like GoW4 seem roughly comparable to action movies like the Transformers, GI Joe, or the Marvel movies. They're not very sophisticated and I assume the core audience is mostly young males. It doesn't mean that these games are not fun to play but they're not Planescape Torment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Status:** UNRESOLVED

**Computer Type:** custom Desktop

**GPU:** Gigabyte Windforce OC (GV-N1060WF2OC-6GD)

**CPU:** Intel i5 4570 no overclock

**Motherboard:** B85M-D3H

**RAM:** 8GB DDR3 800mhz

**PSU:** Cooler Master 500W RS-500-ACAA-B1 (http://www.coolermaster.com/powersupply/g-series/g500/)

**Operating System   Version:** Windows 7 - 64

**GPU Drivers:** 372.90 - I installed them after replacing my old GPU

**Description of Problem:** Crashes when I try to play FIFA 15. Other games seem to be fine. Crash occurs after about 10 mins.

**Troubleshooting:** I tried ramping up the fan (Turbo), but the crash occurs at a low clock speed (1.2Ghz), and with low fan usage (29%) according to GPU-Z. The temperature was 46C. After the monitor goes blank, the fans on my computer seem to ramp up really high and GPU-Z records everything as 0, except for memory usage. The CPU is still running as I can still hear my music playing.

I can run Furmark or the Unigine benchmarks fine. Other games haven't crashed so far.
Any idea what could be happening?

<TEXT> You're right. I did find out the correct answer for the bright color palette after reading Patrick Wyatt's blog:

"If you consider the artwork of the Warcraft series, youll see that the colors are shockingly loud in comparison to, say, Diablo, where only in a dim room is it truly possible to see the beauty of the art. The bright, cartoony art-style was different from the style of many other PC war games of the era, which hewed to more realistic color palette.

Part of that difference can be explained by the past experiences of our artists, who had worked on several Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis console titles, where games required more dynamic colors since televisions of that era were so much worse at displaying colors than PC monitors. Console games on TVs, which had lower pixel resolution and color bleed, needed high-contrast artwork to show well.

Another reason was at the behest of Allen, who charged all the artists with drawing artwork in bright conditions. Hed regularly stalk the halls of Blizzard turning on lights and opening window-blinds.

His view was that most folks play games in bright rooms, so our artists should be authoring our games to play well in that environment. He argued that its easy to draw artwork that reads well when viewed in a dark room with no outside light can distract from the monitor. But when computer art is competing with bright lights its much more difficult to see. And fluorescent bulbs are the worst form of light available  the cold, flickering glow of their tubes tires the eyes and washes out colors.

So the lights were always on in the art rooms to force artists to compensate for terrible lighting by creating art that accounted for those conditions. These working conditions chafed on some (all?) of the art team, but ultimately led to artwork that stood out compared to products of the day.

Now you know why Warcraft artwork looks like it has been candy-coated!" [source](http://www.codeofhonor.com/blog/the-making-of-warcraft-part-2)

But after WoW, SC2 and D3 both adopted a brighter color palette too. This change was a bit controversial in Diablo's case, but the big problem was in the childish story, not the color palette. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sadly, the game just wasn't as fun as it should have been. 

I don't remember where I read this, but the most popular sports are team games, not 1v1 games. I feel like SC2's continued reliance on 1v1 doomed them. I always preferred 2v2s, even in SC1, and I think that was probably the case for a lot of casual players. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  WoL definitely ensured I wouldn't have much interest in the other two expansions. Raynor just apparently forgets how Kerrigan being a duplicitous bitch gets Fenix killed, and apparently forgets what amounted to a blood oath to murder the shit out of her if he ever got the chance.

BW ended that way:

*** Kill Fenix ***

RAYNOR:

   Fenix! No!

KERRIGAN:

   What are you worried, Jim? He died the way all
   Protoss hope to: In combat!

RAYNOR:

   He died because you betrayed him. How many noble
   souls do you need to consume before you're satisfied?
   How many more people need to die before you realize
   what you've become?

KERRIGAN:

   You don't even know what you're talking about, Jim!

RAYNOR:

   Don't I? I'll see you dead for this, Kerrigan. For Fenix
   and all the others who got caught between you and
   your mad quest for power!

KERRIGAN:

   Tough talk, Jimmy. But I don't think you have what it
   takes to be a killer.

RAYNOR:

   It may not be tomorrow,darlin'. It may not even happen
   with an army at my back. But rest assured: I'm the man
   who's going to kill you some day. I'll be seein' you."

And then the next thing we see is that Raynor wants to save Kerrigan. Why?

Also, Kerrigan had won at the end of BW, and she wanted everyone killed, including Raynor:


 Duran :
 
    And what of your allies here on 
    Korhal, my Queen? What would you
    have done with them?
 
 Kerrigan :
 
    They are of no further use to me.
    Though they have proven
    themselves useful, it might be
    dangerous to allow them to live.
    Without the services of General
    Duke, Mengsk will be easy to deal
    with. But Raynor and Fenix are
    uncannily resourceful. They must all
    be eradicated."

So why did she mysteriously spare everyone after BW and peacefully pull back to Char? That was never explained and is basically a giant plothole that started SC2 on the wrong foot. 

And also, most of WoL is just about collecting artifacts for money, which is the worst kind of story. Let's earn money. Yeah. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think their biggest mistake was basing SC2 on a Kerrigan/Raynor love story which only existed in fans' minds. They never really have time to fall in love in SC1 and then Kerrigan betrays Jim at the end of BW really hard. 
Here are their parting words:

*** Kill Fenix ***

RAYNOR:

   Fenix! No!

KERRIGAN:

   What are you worried, Jim? He died the way all
   Protoss hope to: In combat!

RAYNOR:

   He died because you betrayed him. How many noble
   souls do you need to consume before you're satisfied?
   How many more people need to die before you realize
   what you've become?

KERRIGAN:

RAYNOR:

   Don't I? I'll see you dead for this, Kerrigan. For Fenix
   and all the others who got caught between you and

RAYNOR:

   It may not be tomorrow,darlin'. It may not even happen
   with an army at my back. But rest assured: I'm the man
   who's going to kill you some day. I'll be seein' you."

And then, at the end of BW, Kerrigan somehow spares humanity for no clear reason. She has won a decisive victory, but then she pulls back to Char, presumably so that they can have a story for the second game. They seemed to have planned an attack by the Xel'Naga/hybrids at the end of BW, which would have led to Kerrigan's defeat. This would have been better than her just mysteriously pulling back. Here's the end of BW: 

"Alone, floating on a dark platform above the burnt-out planet of Char, Sarah Kerrigan, the Queen of Blades, sat and lorded over the ravenous Swarms. Unable to shake the feeling that a great threat loomed just over the horizon, Kerrigan could only stare off into the vastness of space where she beheld a great void. Or perhaps a reflection of a hollow victory and of the trials yet to come..."

Her mysterious pulling back after BW is pretty much just a big plot hole. </TEXT>

But, he had arguably outlived his time at Blizzard. I think that most people would say that the writing has been one of Blizzard's weaknesses in the past ten years. They've been putting out these really simple good vs evil stories. There's a bad guy who's red and taunting the player.

Apparently, Blizzard doesn't have a well structured process for writing. It was his job as VP to ensure the quality of the writing and he hasn't really been doing that. He's not a professional writer and rose through the ranks at Blizzard. I respect all the good work he did, but maybe it was time for Blizzard to make some changes. </TEXT>

"Project Purification. This genocidal crusade was the Government's final solution to the matter of cleansing humanity of its more degenerate facets. UPL troops scoured every nation on earth, rounding up dissidents, hackers, synthetics, the cybernetically enhanced, tech-pirates, and criminals of every kind. This planet-wide culling resulted in the eradication of nearly 400,000,000 people. The world-media, now under the strict control of the UPL, downplayed the horrific violence and kept the general populace of Earth unaware of the scope and atrocities being committed." </TEXT>

[Terran History: The Decline of Western Civilization](http://archive.rpgclassics.com/subsites/starcraft/thistory.shtml) This is the story from the original Starcraft manual. 

"As the manipulative sciences of cybernetics, cloning and gene-splicing rose steadily into the public forum, militant humanist and hard-line religious groups challenged the rights of private interest corporations who profited from genetic experimentation. Multitudes of people were being augmented with cybernetic implants while others began to minifest slight physical mutations ranging from heightened senses to advanced telepathy. These dramatic changes within the human gene pool caused widespread panic amongst many of the fundamental humanist factions.

Technology continued to evolve and spread, and population rates soared. Near the end of the twentieth century, there were six billion people upon the earth. Within three hundred years, the population had grown to an estimated twenty-three billion. Pollution and a lack of natural resources and affordable fuels added to the fire as world leaders sought ways to stem the growth of their nation's inhabitants. Popular sentiment held that the world was plummeting towards an inevitable catastrophe as overpopulation and genetic alteration swept across the globe.

Meanwhile, as tensions rose around the world regarding the use the capitalization of cybernetics and genetic mutations, many core international economic systems folded in upon themselves and shut down. Horrific acts of terrorism and violence erupted between the corporate sector and the humanist factions, resulting in forced police actions across the globe. Irresponsible media coverage of these atrocious police actions spurred the already rampant civil chaos in many of the larger countries. Ultimately, the precarious balance of world power exploded into international pandemonium."

<TEXT> Fallout:New Orleans is rumored to be in development.

That being said, who knows how good their next game will be? They had a lot of freedom to make Pillars of Eternity and it was somewhat disappointing.

The team that made Kotor 2 and FO:NV probably isn't there anymore. Avellone was the lead designer and he left the company. Of the two other designers, Michael Chu is at Blizzard and Kevin Saunders is working on Torment: Tides of Numenera.

Part of the brilliance of KOTOR2 is that Chris Avellone continued some themes from Planescape Torment. Kreia is apparently a continuation of Ravel, as he said [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20071224183531/http://www.starwarsknights.com/fullstory.php?id=386).

I suspect that there were [tensions between Josh Sawyer and Avellone](https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/71076-lets-get-gossipy-friction-between-avellone-and-sawyer/) at Obsidian, and that Sawyer won. All of J.E. Sawyer's games (where he had a leading role in the writing), are much more conventional in their stories. This includes NWN2, PoE and the Icewind Dale games. It seems like he's a fan of vanilla, plain Jane, Dnd fantasy. Avellone always wanted to subvert things and throw them around on their head, which I appreciate much more. So a Star Wars game by Obsidian might not be as unique. 

Avellone went crazy and read everything he could about the SW universe before making the game (in a very short 14 months timeframe). That's probably not something that anyone else would do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The answer came down to "Theres a cost to everything when it comes to development."

Bethesda is a pretty scrappy developer. Fallout 4 was developed by [just over 100 people](http://gamerant.com/fallout-4-development-team/), which is small for a game that sells this well at AAA prices. They could probably afford 300 developers, and maybe even more. 

But, their games sell well, so why change things? The benefits of increasing their costs are doubtful. The market will probably need to punish them before they decide to change anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's well written, but I still don't really understand what's going on. 

It seems that PPC has 4 BAT registers, which point to 4 memory blocks that are 128 Kbytes to 256 Mbytes in size.

These registers seem to be a way to create 4 large sized pages that can be adressed without doing a full page table lookup.

Short explanation [here](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/osdi99/full_papers/dougan/dougan_html/node3.html):
" The PowerPC also offers an alternative translation from logical to physical that bypasses the TLB/hash-table paging mechanism. When a logical address is referenced, the processor begins the page lookup and, in parallel, begins an operation called block address translation(BAT). Block address translation depends on eight BAT registers: four data and four instruction. The BAT registers associate virtual blocks of 128K or more with physical segments. If a translation via the BAT registers succeeds, the page table translation is abandoned. "

It seems that Clone Wars rewrites those registers at runtime to point to different memory locations. Is that a way of reducing memory access time? I'm not sure what the point of this is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks. Since you seem to understand this, what's the point of this trick? Is it just to adress the extra 16mb of audio ram?

My understanding is that they reference invalid blocks of memory then use the exception handling to rewrite the pointer to point to the audio memory, which they couldn't do before.

That's the right word. SC1's visuals were, IMO, influenced by Aliens and Starship Troopers which were very gretty and dark. SC2's continue the cartoonish style implemented by Blizzard in World of Warcraft. One reason, IMO, is that cartoonish art styles look good even with flat lighting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anecdotally, I've playing a bit of SC2 Mass Recall (SC1 campaign remade in SC2) and SC1 arguably looks better. SC2 has a brighter and more cartoony art style. 

SC2's engine is also a bit dated by now. It doesn't use any dynamic lighting. The shaders aren't always the best. They tend to be a bit too shiny. 

There's something to be said for the artistic control that 2D gives you. Compare [SC1](http://www.gamershell.com/static/screenshots/0/2883/46149_full.jpg) vs [SC2](https://media-curse.cursecdn.com/attachments/23/446/ff28c6733990938b6540de5c0acc20b2.png). BW looks handcrafted. 2D also leaves more to the imagination. ([early SC2 bunker as a bonus](http://www.sc2blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/bunkers.jpg)) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  They really changed to a bizarre pretty vanilla Space Marines Shooting Stuff type scenario. Why did we have to work for Cerberus? 

There's certainly a perception, true or false, that military fantasy type games sell better. The target audience for AAA games are young men. The perception is that they love shooting at stuff, and they love badass marines.

Bioware was trying to grow at the time and sell itself to EA. So, it needed to show that it could play in "the big leagues". With Dragon Age 2, they also moved towards more of an action game and they changed the design of the world to be more edgy. Everything became grey, spiky and more violent. It seems to have worked okay for them.

The Mass Effect and Dragon Age games grew from the relative "niche" of RPGs to a more mainstream action/RPG hybrid. The Mass Effect story moved towards a military space fantasy. Dragon Age always had a standard "kill the evil demon" story, but the wrapping was what made it interesting. A lot of that was sacrificied in later games. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right now, the mechanics mimic what flying a WW2 airplane is like. Orbital mechanics are very different. In orbit, your speed is related to your altitude. So, boosting your speed like we do now to reach another spaceship could send you on a weird orbit and if you just aim at the other spaceship, your encounter with it would be very brief. Try docking things in KSP or watch Scott Manley doing it: https://youtu.be/srsiLZLPiv0. It's very tricky. This would probably not be fun as none of our intuition about how to fly a plane would work. Dogfights wouldn't be possible.  </TEXT>

In PoE incidentally, my character was underpowered and I wish that I could have respecced him to try out different spells. But no, this is an old school RPG and I'll have to accept being stuck with soul whip for the rest of the game.

I just want to experience the story and the world and not bother about combat systems.

<TITLE> What were the Ancient Romans and Greeks' attitude towards technology? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-25 21:04:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In the videogame Fallout New Vegas, Caesar's legion who are heavily inspired by Romans have a negative attitude towards technology. 

I wonder what were the real Romans' attitude to technology. According to a user in /r/Fallout,  (/u/detarame ) , "The Roman elite were very skeptical of technology in general. Cicero and his ilk often appreciated the utility of technology, but since they generally scorned doing the things technology usually improved (ie: work), they were only capable of a limited appreciation for the progress technological improvement allowed. Also worth noting that the Romans were a deeply conservative people and that slave based economies actually stifle innovation, because the people doing the work have no real incentive to improve their efficiency. Hell, the Greeks literally invented the STEAM ENGINE and dismissed it as a toy - as did the Romans - for the entire existence of their societies because who the hell needs machines to do work?" He also says that the Romans borrowed a lot of technology from other cultures.

Is this true? Did they view technology with suspicion? Did they invent a steam engine and not use it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's true that it doesn't make sense but in the end it's a game, not the real world. 

I will never replay most RPGs that I've played, and I suppose that it's the same for most people. I won't go back and create a second character. It sucks when I create an underoptimized character, find that the game is kicking my ass and then I'm stuck with it. This is what happened to me in Pillars of Eternity. I didn't choose the right skills and, my character was getting its ass kicked. 

This is a singleplayer game. Who cares if I respec mid game after having finally understood some mechanics and read forum posts? Should I really have been required to do hours of research on optimal builds before starting the game? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The part that I find interesting:
"From the beginning of this franchise ten years ago, we started dealing with -- well, the first thing we did was we started researching. We researched where technology is taking us. And what is happening in the biotechnology field. And that's where we hit, by totally layering it into our research.

And we looked at everything from scientific articles and things to philosophical articles and social commentary articles. So we did a lot of research in the beginning, in order to lay the groundwork for what Human Revolution was. And once we finished Human Revolution, we took that farther. So we begin by putting in all of - by kind of putting in all that focus into the initial research.

"And then we say to ourselves what our job is, and what I'm often saying to the team is, our job is to hold a mirror up to the world. And expose it.

And allow -- because one of the precepts of Deus Ex is, we don't tell you what to think. You have to make your own decisions. You live it. And we try to present all sides of that issue to you. And that does get very challenging, as a writer, because you have to be constantly questioning your own biases, many of which you may not even know you have.

So you have to kind of always be looking at things from all sides. And present it from one side, then look at it and figure out okay, how do I present it from the other side? And it's a very difficult thing, and a lot of the time you do run into situations where people on the team will be like, this is too controversial. We can't put this in. This is too much, we can't do that.

And then we kind of have to talk that out, and say, if we approach it with as much respect as possible, and if we remember what we're trying to do here is tackle deep issues and show the world is shades of grey, and always allow the player to decide, not try to inflict a judgment. But it does put us into scary territory."

I don't think there's any other game that has a writing process like this, trying to incorporate deep questions about science and philosophy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I couldn't get into the game either.

As /u/Vertex19 said, the writing is bad. That was supposed to be Obsidian's strong point. But companies change over time. Or maybe they spent too much time on the engine and didn't have time polishing the game. But I don't think that's the case since the expansion seems to be just as boring. 

They wanted to mimic Icewind Dale and make a game focused on action instead of story. I think they failed and that it was a bad idea. Icewind Dale is a generic Dnd adventure with lots of fighting and too little interesting story content. 

And I've seen very few users on Reddit defend the game. The sub has been dead since release. It seems that there just aren't any cool moments to share with other players.

It's kind of a slap in the face for Josh Sawyer too who was the lead designer. Out of the games he's made, only Fallout New Vegas really turned out to be awesome. NWN2 was pretty bad, at least the base campaign. Alpha Protocol had potential. I kind of see a pattern though. Icewind Dale, PoE and NWN2 all have in common that they have pretty bad generic DnD stories. Exactly the kind of thing that Chris Avellone brilliantly subverted and made fun of in Planescape Torment, and to some extent in KOTOR2. 
(The fact that Alpha Protocol and Fallout New Vegas had dedicated writers might further explain why their stories didn't suck.)

Edit: Good explanation by /u/Coolthulu of why the story sucks: https://www.reddit.com/r/projecteternity/comments/4jm03i/pillars_of_eternity_ii_is_already_in_production/d393gjt </TEXT>

<TEXT> While you're mostly right, I don't want to be too negative. Let's wait and see.

But obviously this won't solve any of the core problems with the game. Not that I'm surprised. With their previous game (CIM2), CO only released cosmetic DLC. At least this time, it's a little bit more substantial. But they seem totally unwilling to rethink their game and make more basic changes. 

Paradox is frisky about investing money into non revenue-generating activities, but CO is ten times worse. They don't seem to be willing to invest their time/money into something that won't be sold. Also, the success of Cities:Skylines, doesn't seem to have caused them to increase their staff.

Can't help but contrast this with Blizzard which has invested into countless free updates for their games (incoming SC2 major patch, major D3 content added after expansion). </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is static, not real time generation. Here's an explanation:  http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131507/a_realtime_procedural_universe_.php

"A static algorithm is one that generates a static mesh of vertices or height values. The most common form generates a 2D bitmap of height values, then uses the bitmap to build a triangle mesh for a flat landscape. While some static algorithms are very good, they all suffer from two crippling problems. The first is that you need a ridiculously large mesh to get any detail for a full-size planetary body. The second is that the speed of the algorithm depends on the size of the mesh.

To give you an idea of the size we're talking about with planetary bodies, an order-10 sphere based on an icosahedron (20 * 410 triangles) has almost 21 million triangles in it. For a planet the size of Earth, the triangle edges would be 300km long. The edges for an order-20 sphere (22 trillion triangles) would be 0.3km long. It would be ridiculously slow, take up an enormous amount of storage space, and still wouldn't be able to show you details on individual hills or mountains. In that light, it seems that the only feasible way to generate a planet is to come up with something more dynamic.

My definition of a "dynamic" algorithm is an algorithm that takes some sort of vertex coordinates as parameters and returns the proper height value at those coordinates. These coordinates could be longitude and latitude, polar coordinates, 3D coordinates, or anything else you can think of that consistently and uniquely identifies a vertex. Paired with an adapting mesh algorithm such as the one that will be explained in Part 2 of this series, you would not need to store anything in memory or on disk except for the mesh you need to draw for that frame. The ideal algorithm would be initialized with a random seed and a number of defining parameters that would allow you to create a range of interesting planetary bodies from one algorithm." </TEXT>

This paper shows an interesting approach that doesn't rely on a simulation: http://cg.cs.uni-bonn.de/aigaion2root/attachments/derzapfPlanets.pdf It starts from the ocean and moves up to mountains. 

The problem with rivers and lakes is that they are shaped by the geography of an entire region. This means analyzing the topography before drawing the river, which cannot be done in real time. Also, erosion takes place over thousands of years and would require a simulation which also cannot be done in real time. Hence the need for some trickery.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  To show how weak the systems were by having a much prettier PC version on such a large title would have been bad in a business sense. 

I don't think that's the case at all. It's just much simpler to have the game be as similar as possible across all platforms. Less time is spent developing and debugging. 

Would you have been okay with the game coming out 18 months later on PC and costing 30% more? The reality is that adapting a game engine and assets to a more powerful platform has a cost.

For Watch Dogs 2, we are in a much more predictable context. We have been developing the game on our target platforms from the beginning. " </TEXT>

<TEXT> while gambling can be entertainingand need not be financially ruinousit also comes with certain risks. 

Not to nitpick since his point is about how gambling is bad, but I don't find gambling fun. Once I understood that no matter what I do in, say, a casino, I have 0% chance of winning, then gambling seemed very boring to me. Just stare at a screen and pull the lever over and over again. The only excitement comes from the possibility of winning, but that possibility isn't even real. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Humans get easily addicted to random rewards. Most MMO RPGs, or games like Diablo, are based on slot-machine like rewards. You have a random chance of getting a "big" item. 

However, in most games it's hard to trade an item for real money and the developers frown upon it. So, it's harmless since it's all just for fun but it's still the same mechanics at work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep, as Anandtech writes:

As AMD has made clear over the last several months, one of the major goals of Polaris was power efficiency, and this is where we see some of the first payoffs from that decision. RX 480s official Typical Board Power (TBP) is 150W, over 20% lower than the last-generation R9 380, and 45% lower than the otherwise performance-comparable R9 390. Consequently the card only requires a single 6-pin PCIe power connector for external power, making it a more friendly option for power-limited desktops that dont offer additional power connectors. (...)

So what lessons did AMD learn for Polaris? First and foremost, power efficiency matters. It matters quite a lot in fact. Every vendor  be it AMD, Intel, or NVIDIA  will play up their strongest attributes. But power efficiency caught on with consumers, more so than any other feature in the 28nm generation. Though its importance in the desktop market is forum argument fodder to this day, power efficiency and overall performance are two sides of the same coin.

They thought they could get away with it if the card appeared power-efficient. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that this was almost certainly a poorly managed project. It's part of the risk of backing a kickstarter. Something similar happened with Broken Age, except that they delivered a more satisfactory product in the end.

An important point is that kickstarter is not a store. When I back a project, I know that there's X% chance that I'll get what was promised, Y% that it will be better and Z% that it will be worse. There's an element of risk to backing. Some project managers and some teams are very good and some aren't. Many games never make it to release or don't meet expectations when they are released.  </TEXT>

As said in the article, once all the fees to kickstarter and Amazon are paid, plus the physical rewards, plus the lawyers and taxes, there's not that much money left.

<TEXT>  Someone at Nintendo has to understand that they could probably keep people from purchasing an Xbox or PlayStation to supplement their Nintendo console if they would implement the necessary hardware and work with 3rd parties to get those titles on to the platform.

Nintendo doesn't want to compete head-on with the other consoles. They want to have the unique/quirky console. 

For the NX, they could easily have picked up an AMD APU and created something similar to the PS4 and XOne that would allow easy porting. But I'm pretty sure they didn't do that. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   The only reason to do what they are doing is to try and lock people into their hardware platform

I agree. They're playing the long term game. They prefer not to get money from Vive owners to ensure that their platform becomes the dominant one.

Catch is, there's no way to enforce this indefinitely on an open platform like PC, and you usually need a pretty sizeable headstart on the competition to make it work. This would have been a really good plan if the vive hadn't come out of freakin nowhere two months before pre-orders went live.

I mostly agree. But if Oculus keeps buying all the good games and Valve doesn't do anything in response, then buyers will notice that the Rift offers a superior experience. This will be an expensive strategy in the long term and I don't know if they can keep this up indefinitely. Eventually, they won't just be competing against the Vive but against an army of Chinese clones. </TEXT>

It not how big it is, it's how you use it. AMD cards tend to have better compute capabilities, but games are not always optimized to take advantage of them. Things are different in a console. 

It's a bit like with the PS3. Not everyone could use the Cell processor efficiently. Many developers let the SPUs go to waste. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  But buying out games that were already in development or close to completion like what they did with Giant Cop is just objectively anti-consumer. 

The real reason is that they'll never make money by just being a hardware manufacturer. They need to create a locked-down ecosystem, like Apple or Sony. That's obviously not in the best interest of customers who want an open platform. 

But they don't want to see customers buying a game through Steam and giving a 30% cut to Valve while they struggle to make 5% on hardware. Oculus is not a viable investment as a pure hardware manufacturer. Better leave that low-margin business to Asian manufacturers who are close to the production. (TVs and computer monitors are all manufactured by Asian companies)

I'm just trying to be informative. Not defending Facebook but explaining why they might be making those decisions with the Oculus Rift. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi,

I just bought a new ipad air 2 128 GB, used mostly for office work, web and TV series.

Would it be worth returning it and then waiting to get the new 10in iPad pro? I don't do color sensitive work or movie editing. The pencil could be useful for signing documents, instead of those cheaper pencils I use. Keyboard is interesting but a bit pricey (but worth it?).

What do you think? </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Review] My observations after 24 hours </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-22 21:16:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I like the game. I got it yesterday and then played until 4 in the morning.

What I liked less:

- Repetitive buildings
- no autosave: My computer crashed after maybe 2 hours and I lost everything.
- Wrong difficulty curve: 

The game was actually a bit challenging at first. I kept running out of money in the early stages because I built up too fast. When you run out of money you can't build anything, and at first you can't even take a loan so you're pretty much doomed. Also, you can't take multiple small loans like in CiM2.

But once I got past a certain point, I had almost too much money and 5 star properties everywhere. I do have experience with SC4, but I found it a bit too easy to build a successful city. This is was really my first city if you don't count me restarting a few times at the beginning.

- The wrong things are failing in my city. What I mean is that my biggest problems are things that shouldn't be big problems in real life (hearses).

For example, one of my biggest problems is that hearses are not reaching their "customers". I do have more than enough crematoriums and graveyards.. It's probably because of the huge traffic jams. 

However, workers seem to be able to go to work, or at least my businesses aren't being abandoned. In real life, even though traffic might be bad, hearses can still move around the city. But you might expect workers to look for jobs closer to their homes and so for inaccessible businesses to shut down. SC4 simulated this much better, especially with the NAM addon.

Another problem is fire trucks. My buildings burn down even with good coverage, probably because the fire trucks are stuck in traffic. They really should have a way to get to fires quickly.

Keeping crime under control seems a bit too easy. I just have a few police stations and that's it. Maybe that's because the developers are Finnish, but it would be fun to have a "high-crime" scenario or have crime as a difficulty setting. Also, maybe other stuff like jails and helicopters could be added. Same thing for healthcare.

Something seems a bit weird about the way that workers get to work. I don't see businesses being abandoned because workers can't reach them. And I don't seem to see a realistic number of parked cars on the street near businesses. I need to investigate this, but I feel like workers don't really commute. Also, there doesn't seem to be rush hours or anything like that. So, the result is that traffic seems to have a bigger effect on hearses, garbage trucks and fire trucks than on businesses and workers, which is the opposite of what I would expect.

Too many garbage trucks. I have an army of garbage trucks in my city and they seem to generate a much too high proportion of traffic.

- Unique buildings are not very good. They're kind of bland. Their effect is not clear. They don't cost that much. They don't really seem to employ people, even the big commercial ones. THey don't have the little stats that gave a little bit of personality to the SC4 unique buildings. The aquarium, for example, is boring. I can't see whales, sharks or dolphins. It just looks like a generic modern building and doesn't seem to really draw in visitors or anything.

Pollution seems very easy to contain. My industrial sector barely sends any smoke into the air. It seems to stay concentrated within a very tight radius.

High tech industrial buildings don't look high tech enough... SC4 had better building design overall.

The school system is simple. There are no private schools, small high schools, college, huge universities, branch and city libraries, city museums. It's much simpler than SC4 and probably why it's so easy.

Road maintenance doesn't seem to be as important. I haven't really checked this out, but it seems possible to just leave it at 100% even when building a ton of roads.

Buggy traffic. It's been reported here. The traffic algorithms used in Skylines and CIM2 are far from perfect. Cars seem to rarely used all of the available lanes efficiently.

Low density is not really low density: Houses don't have a large yard and house more than one household. It would be interesting to truly replicate urban sprawl.

High density is not really high density: High rises have, what, 20 households living in them? Not really realistic.

Public transportation not as good as in CiM2: I don't expect CO to pack Cities in Motion inside of CSKY, but it would be great to have a few more options. I'd like to pack my longer routes with more buses. I'd like to have trams. I'd like to have different vehicles.

Also, I'd like to have more than one underground level and to be able to see inside my metro stations like in CIM2.

No control over zone size: When I make a zone along a long road, I don't see a way of making it a certain size.

Airports: Seems to be only a single size of airport.

Chirps are annoying: Any way of making the bird fly away? It keeps repeating the same stupid things and is useless most of the time.

Disasters: No disasters?

Regions: No regions I guess.

These are my thoughts about the game so far. I've had a lot of fun, but I expect that I'll probably get bored fairly quickly. Seems to have less depth than SC4. Top-tier buildings are easy to get and don't seem to require as much effort to get. I do really like the tools for building highways.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Has anyone noticed that if you crash in the uphill portion of the matterhorn (night race), that your car can be unable to go up the hill. I have a modified Lancia Delta with 300hp, yet it can't get up the hill, even starting from the top portion of the hill if it starts from a complete stop (like after a crash). The car will actually roll backwards as it's unable to counteract the insane gravitational forces of GT Earth. In reality, a 100hp engine should easily be able to push a 1300kg car up a hill. And the car does have 300 ft-pound of torque, which would put it in the same class as some fairly powerful cars: http://www.autosnout.com/Car-Torque-List.php. This shows how bad the physics engine is. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-11-23 15:56:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> On PC, when I start a conversation, not a cutscene, the camera just freezes in whatever position I was when I initiated the conversation. This means that I can spend an entire conversation looking at a door and having sound only coming in from the left speaker (if the characters are on my left). Is this a PC bug or is it the same across all platforms? In past games, you used to have a zoomed up view of characters' faces during conversations and I think that was rather better. But I'm still not sure if it's a bug or if it's intended to be that way.

Also, I often hear other characters talking during conversations or other sounds. It seems like they don't mute background noise enough. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The wikis for Vicky II and HOI 3 are kind of lacking. I think that good wikis would help make these games more accessible. I wonder what the problem is? Is that the player base is too small or that no one knows how some mechanics in the games work?

Paradox games in general do a pretty bad job at explaining how they work, so the lacklustre wikis only make the situation worse. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Troubleshooting] Did my headphones just destroyed my computer? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-01 06:15:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have Sennheiser headphones with a very long cable and they tend to get tangled up everywhere. Last week, I managed to destroy my frontal audio port while moving my chair.

What happened was that as I stood up from my chair, the cable must have been somehow tangled around my legs and it yanked the computer pretty hard. I saw that my 3.5mm connector was bent, again, but no problem I have another one. But then I noticed that the screen was frozen.

I reboot the computer, and I'm only getting a blank screen and the computer reboots after a few seconds. What should I do? The audio port at the back is just on top of the graphics card and the card appeared to be a bit loose. I put it back into place, but it's still not working. Could this have somehow damaged the graphics card or the motherboard? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> These are the little things that nag me so far in Dragonfall:

- No control over party equipment
- Items given to party members disappear after mission
- Not much choice for equipment
- Conversation options that disappear. For example, it requires a biotech 3 to ask Zaak about his ears. If I exit the convo, get 3 in biotech and come back, the conversation option is gone. That's just lazy coding IMO. I actually loaded a save 10 min earlier once due to that problem.
- Combat doesn't end properly after a party of enemies has been dispatched
- Bad "papers floating in the wind" animation is everywhere
- Can't talk to everyone. I want to know what that guy is doing sitting on a bench all by himself.
- Some character convos didn't get updated after a certain major event
- Matrix runs need more variety
- Still not that many special options for deckers?
- Can't see character HP outside of battle
- Lack of sophistication of combat model (I guess this is a big one)
- Bug when my mage couldn't cast a spell on himself
- Slowdown in one huge fight
- Alt-tab doesn't stop sound
- Thank God for the save function! I'm so happy they put this in.

That's all I can think about right now. What are yours? </TEXT>

These boards range from cheap to not so cheap and I'm surprised at the number of 1 star(egg) reviews from failed motherboards. Is there really a benefit to buying a more expensive board in terms of reliability? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm looking for a cheap PC and it seems like going micro was less expensive (plus it's smaller). My only worries are that I won't be able to fit a full sized PCI-Express card. I'm planning on putting in an old RADEON HD 4870. Also, the memory is incredibly cheap and CAS 10. Will that slow down everything? And I sort of picked a motherboard at random. Oh, and this would be used for gaming.

<TEXT> Actually, I have no idea what difficulty I'm playing. Any way to find out or change it? And can I revert before my last checkpoint? I stupidly started a mission with only two runners. I hope I won't have to start over from the start. </TEXT>

<TITLE> 500$ gaming PC (Canada), no graphics card </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-06-11 02:44:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I already have a decent video card, so no need to buy one. I was trying to build something decent, but here's the best I could do:

PCPartPicker part list: http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/p/1564S

CPU: Intel Core i5-3350P 3.1GHz Quad-Core Processor  ($183.39 @ DirectCanada) 

Motherboard: ASRock H77M Micro ATX  LGA1155 Motherboard  ($74.99 @ Newegg Canada) 

Memory: G.Skill Ripjaws X Series 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-1600 Memory  ($70.40 @ DirectCanada) 

Storage: Seagate Barracuda 3TB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive  ($129.99 @ Canada Computers) 

Case: Antec Three Hundred Illusion ATX Mid Tower Case  ($64.99 @ Newegg Canada) 

Power Supply: Antec EarthWatts Green 500W 80 PLUS Bronze Certified ATX12V / EPS12V Power Supply  ($64.99 @ NCIX) 

Optical Drive: Lite-On iHAS124-04 DVD/CD Writer  ($16.99 @ Newegg Canada) 

Total: $605.74

I'm sure it's possible to get something almost as good for under 500$. I'm guessing cheaper memory, power supply and case. Maybe there's also a better cpu. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Republic too dominant after Republic DLC? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-04-13 21:09:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, I don't have the Republic DLC, so I'm not playing as a republic, but I noticed that in my latest game (first after the DLC), the merchants republics seem to be dominating. Pisa has established a small empire in the Tunis region (in fact it has lost Pisa and moved its capital there). Venezia commands huge stacks of troops and has started expanding all around the gulf as well as in other areas of the Mediterranean. I get the feel that these republics really are the most significant forces in the world right after the HRE and maybe France (I play as Napoli so I'm mostly focused on the area around Italy, Sicily and the North of Africa).  England seems to be weaker than Venice with all their problems with revolts. In fact, one factor helping the republics is that they seem much less prone to internal conflicts.

These are just my impressions from one game, so I don't know how others feel, but so far my problem is that this seems more like a Renaissance game with powerful merchants than a Medieval game with powerful kingdoms. We are only in the 1100s. Merchant republics are not supposed to be, IMO, a dominant force. Another more general problem might be the fact that ships are a bit OP compared to the time period. They cost a lot in maintenance, but they can never be lost and so allow these very rich republic to just pick whatever coastal province around the world and build a sort of international empire. </TEXT>
