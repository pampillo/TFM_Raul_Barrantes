<TEXT> Never posted here before, and I have no film background. I came up with this question while watching Drive with Gosling:

Is there a certain significance to scenes when you can see all characters (at least 3 or more) in the same perspective/picture? </TEXT>
</WRITING>
<WRITING>
<TITLE> NBA Radio game in Drive </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-06 06:31:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In the beginning scene you see on the TV and later confirm on the radio that Gosling's character is listening to the Toronto Raptors play the LA Clippers at Staples Center.

If you pay attention to the radio, you notice that the announcer mentions the names Brand, Griffin, and Kaman. Regardless of what year this movie is supposed to occur, the names Kaman and Brand can only refer to Chris Kaman and Elton Brand.

The mistake here is that those two players never played in the same game as a Griffin (who played for the Raptors). The likely Griffin that is being referenced is Blake Griffin, but in his only year playing with Kaman (2011), Brand was with the Philadelphia 76ers, not the Raptors. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-04-30 05:47:15 </DATE>

<TEXT> I was watching a movie and had an interesting idea:

What if, before the game, you could designate a specific piece to move like a queen, and in making this designation change your queen to move like a king? I feel like this could create some new avenues for strategy, especially considering that discovering who your opponent is using as their "hidden" queen would become part of the equation.

I don't know if this has ever been proposed before. Just a thought, what do you think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like I said in my first sentence (my pseudo nut graf, if you will) I gave up on journalism to pursue teaching, so forgive me if my formatting isn't quite up to par you pedantic POS. I digress.

"It is not essential."

You know what else isn't essential? For you to be living on this earth and breathing, but I'm not over here marginalizing your life and dismissing it as something we can do without.

This isn't just a handful of TV anchors from an overzealous corporation being cast off. This is **dozens** of hardworking people who have a right to make a living for themselves. Not all of them are high-level senior editors either. In fact, most of them are reporters and former interns, some of whom probably called their parents to brag about finding a full-time job in a dying industry, only to be let go at a moment's notice because of said dying industry.

I haven't been a fan of ESPN for a long time, but I'm not over here celebrating their demise. And no, the fact that Bleacher Report and Fox and other competing sports sites exist doesn't necessarily mean all these now-unemployed-former-ESPNers are going to find a job easily. ESPN has been dominating its market for a reason, and those competitors (with seriously smaller budgets) are going to struggle to scoop up one to two former ESPNers, much less their entire former NHL department.

What's more, you are seriously overestimating the general population's ability to interpret a box score. I don't follow hockey, so I sure as hell can't explain to someone else how "points" are calculated. And if you think the entire value of a basketball game can be summed up in a box score then please tell me how [this](http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199806140UTA.html) at all signifies the importance and magnitude of the game in question.

My last point is in regards to your second to last sentence. If you were actually spending time researching the demise of ESPN, you would know that their objective, according to [Andy Katz](https://twitter.com/TheAndyKatz/status/857628431567212548), was "being right, not just first." And considering his experience in his industry, I'm a hell of a lot more inclined to believe his assertion in lieu of yours.

You sound like a truly toxic person, and I sympathize with anyone that has to interact with your dismissive arrogance on a daily basis. Just a tip: life is a lot more enjoyable when you choose to celebrate and embrace other people instead of looking down on them and sneering.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who actually gave up on journalism to go into teaching because it's a more stable career, go fuck yourself. My "sports" writing was no different than my "entertainment" writing or my "news" writing. It's a dying industry because of failing standards and information availability. In terms of the consumability of a specific beat, "food" writing is no more effective then Yelp, and concert reviews are about as effective as Yahoo Music. Sports journalism is valuable in the sense that we have former players to interview and reference, but the accessibility of the sports make it easier to dismiss the importance of relevant articles and columns after the fact. Journalism, in and of itself, is pointless without an audience, so as long as there is a market for it, there is a place for writers to work. Also gtfo for insinuating that anyone losing their job and source of income is in any way justified or inconsequential. Have some fucking humanity and get off your high horse for assuming that any form of "writing" is better than any other. I'm actually going to have a beer because reading and considering your point makes me feel hollow and sick. Fuck you. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about how a website can still identify me with outdated information? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-27 17:47:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Context: Last night I was searching around for a stream to watch the new episode of Better Call Saul. One of the search results sent me to, I think, Project Watch Series. The stream didn't work, but I noticed that towards the bottom you could see that I was "logged in" with Facebook. 

I can't recall if I ever used this site before, maybe back in college, but the thumbnail was a previous profile pic I haven't had in over  3-4 years, and the email listed was one that I deleted a long time ago. I deactivated FB over a month ago, too, but the most bewildering part is the fact that I am using a work laptop that has never accessed/been associated with that old, no-longer-existent email.

I'm not entirely concerned about the security of this -- I promptly logged out and exited the site. My question is how a site like this can retain information over such a long period of time and still identify me when I visit with a completely different laptop? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's almost as if this is a team sport and his fellow Rockets deserve some credit for winning (and if you actually cared to research your beloved run you would have mentioned Mario Elie's GW in the WCSF game 7, without which Hakeem would have gone home with nothing). 

Furthermore, Hakeem didn't have a HoF center guarding him every round, which is why the Suns and Jazz didn't have an answer for him. Who cares if Stockton or Johnson were on the other team, those guys weren't guarding Hakeem.

And if we're going based on opponent record, Kobe and Shaq in 2001 are more impressive than LeBron last year since the Cavs played garbage opponents all three rounds before the Finals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can see it now. Game 4 of the NBA Finals, W's getting ready to sweep the Bulls. Dray already has 11pts/4reb/5ass/6blks/5stls. Chicago is down by 27 and Carter-Williams puts up a desperation three with three seconds left. The ball caroms of the rim right towards Green, who raises his hands to the sky. As the ball flies right towards him, he drops eight fingers and flips off the nearest camera with both hands. The ball flies right between his outstretched arms like Vinatieri in the SuperBowl as the buzzer sounds, and r/NBA collectively implodes out of frustration. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think it's personal. It's just annoying when "of-the-moment" fanboys here online declare everything that they watch to be the GOAT, WOAT, etc. Nothing can be anything other than two extremes. 

And call me crazy, but I think that it would lend more credibility if columnists, coaches, NBA personalities, and former players were the ones declaring LBJ the new GOAT instead of armchair fans. Unless these Cavs/LeBron fans know more about the game of basketball than former players.... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lmao. Someone can have the opinion that Britney Spears  Mozart. Sure they're entitled to that opinion; it's still wrong.

You're also contradicting yourself. Previously you stated that you never watched Jordan, now you're saying you've seen his highlights. Which is it?

Moreover, this convo for GOAT wasn't 1A and 1B going into last night's game. One great performance doesn't automatically dismiss MJ or make LBJ leapfrog him. Beating a 42-win team and scoring 40 points doesn't make you the GOAT. It's happened many times before, and not just by Jordan. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We thought that for every one person that wanted to do something negative, there would be thousands that wanted to overwrite that with something positiveand we were right. It turns out collaborating to make something bad is far harder than collaborating to make something good.

Mankind and existence at its basis, but maybe without the polarizing ideals. Negating creation is not decidedly **bad** nor is positive collaboration decidedly **good**. Creation and destruction are based on perspective. Even if the void had succeeded, it would still represent collaboration, for good or bad is a matter of opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We already know that the Accounting Equation says Assets = Liabilities + Equity. And we know that, say, the US Govt owns Assets in the way of land, buildings, resources, capital, etc., and they carry Liabilities in the way of bonds, securities, and borrowing from other countries.

So is it possible for governments to carry Equity to balance out the equation? Do they have any Enterprise Value? Or does the Equity just zero out and Assets = Liabilities? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed. I don't think it's just enough to say "I would have made $XM instead" and be done with it. Where's the reflection? Where's the risk-taking? I prefer the responses where people are specific and adventurous:

"I would have taken a chance and asked out Cynthia from sophomore year."

There's no guarantee she says yes. Maybe she turns you down and you suffer embarrassingly at the hands of your peers. But at least you took a chance and probably learned a valuable lesson. Maybe she actually was a self-centered wench and you would still be worshiping the memory of her if not for the truth of experience.

And above all else, get-rich-quick just seems like a lazy answer. There is so much more to be gained if I went back 10-15 years than just through economic ventures.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No this is cute because I (a Laker fan) am giving props to a guy with more historical significance to your team, and you're taking offense to it either way. Nice straw man though, Russell is too controversial for me to start down that road. 

I watched Pierce his entire career. He was a great player, no doubt, but Hondo was better. But moreover, why does my age matter? I've watched hundreds of YouTube videos which are the only living remnants of a long-gone era. The 1976 NBA Finals was one of my favorite to rewatch (at least, what you can find of it). 

But you're also conveniently ignoring where I said "come off the bench" and "hit one of the craziest shots in Finals history." Pierce never did either of those things. Is that the epitome of deciding who is better? No, but you've made it your prerogative to say Pierce did everything Hondo did.

This isn't a matter of debate. Hondo is unanimously considered top-25 all-time. I could name 30 guys better than Pierce without breaking a sweat.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> More like his adaptability to doing whatever the Celtics needed of him. Lead the team in scoring? Check. Facilitate the offense? Check. Guard the opposing team's best wing scorer? Check. Come off the bench? Check. Hit one of the craziest shots in NBA Finals history? [Check](https://youtu.be/hmtlU_HhzHE?t=2m42s).

EDIT: Looks like I may need more to persuade the youngins here. Havlicek and Pierce both averaged 20ppg 8 times in their careers, and Havlicek never averaged fewer than 14. Pierce has averaged less than 14 each of the last four years, so taking off those years...he doesn't pass Hondo in total points. Let's tack on the fact that Hondo has a higher career average in points, rebounds, assists, FT%, and only trails Paul by 0.06% in FG%. Statistics out of the way, Havlicek was largely considered the greatest wing of all-time until the '80s. The Truth was a great player, no lie, but Havlicek is up there as top-25 all-time. Pierce *might* be top-40. </TEXT>

Take last year, for example. Steph by far and away deserved the award because he was the best player in the world from November-May. Once the playoffs rolled around, however, LeBron turned up the heat and reestablished himself. Curry was adequately awarded with the regular season MVP; LeBron was adequately awarded by winning the title and Finals MVP. </TEXT>

You didn't have to say career achievement, my assertion is that the HoF is an adequate honor for someone who is supposedly the best in the world but passed up for worthier MVPs.

Moreover, best player according to what? Numbers? He's beat. Wins? He's beat. Reputation? Sure, but the season still has to play out, and it's not played on paper. If reputation were everything the Warriors would be 74-8, and the MVP would be handed out in October every year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> LeBron's team is collapsing around him as we speak, and there are three other teams with better records than his, and two other guys with better stats than him. The MVP award is not based on career accomplishments, natural ability, or labeling someone as "best in the world." He has not accomplished what Russ and Harden have this year, and you can't keep referring to his status as being deserving of an award that is entirely single-season based. He's accomplished enough, and he doesn't need this "lifetime achievement MVP award" to boost his legacy. Tip your cap to him, put him on the All-NBA First Team, but stop trying to argue that he deserves special treatment for being best in the world; your 2017 MVP is either Harden/Russ/Kawhi. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not what I'm saying. Longevity is surely a factor in the GOAT convo, but as unrealized accolades become fewer and far between, the deciding factor -- to me at least -- becomes "did you make it a point to be the greatest player on the floor when it mattered the most?" For MJ, this was never a question. You give him 19 years and I doubt that ever changes. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Brand new to PS4/2K...help with setting up game/MyPlayer please? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-08 19:43:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I just bought my first PS4 with 2K17, was able to play it a few times without connecting to Network play, and I have some questions regarding the MyPlayer account and set-up:

-The game allows you to "Start Application Without Updating," right now it's looking like a 3-hour update...but I won't be able to connect the MyPlayer with the app to scan my face without the network features right?

-when I go to log-in to the MyPlayer app on my phone, it says "A valid NBA 2K17 save was not found," but I already played through the Midnight Madness after making my guy go to Kansas...did I not properly save 2K on my PS4 yet?

-I'm assuming I need the network features enabled in order to download current rosters?

All in all I'm just really confused about all this...I haven't had my own game console since GameCube so all the networks/downloads/updates are pretty difficult to keep track of. Any help would be appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did you ever hear the tragedy of Derrick Rose The Bull? I thought not. Its not a story the NBA would tell you. Its a r/NBA legend. Derrick Rose was a PG of the Bulls, so powerful and so wise he could use his athleticism to influence the ball to create lay-ups He had such a knowledge of the game that he could even keep the ones he cared about from injuring themselves. The eastern conference of the NBA is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so talented the only thing he was afraid of was losing his talent, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught Jimmy Butler everything he knew, then his apprentice had him traded to the Knicks. Ironic. He could save others from injuries, but not himself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I beg to differ. You just beat an Indiana team that is barely in the playoff race, and you just got trounced by the Spurs (and pretty much every other western contender this year). Sure, LeBron's performances have been gaudy, but let's not pretend the team is anywhere close to being championship-ready. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My issues with coasting/flopping:

Coasting: LeBron has shown that when he absolutely refuses to lose he is by far and away the best on the planet and of his generation. I would rather see him go balls to the wall every game and play maybe 3-4 fewer seasons just to see what he could do.

Flopping: He's the best athlete the NBA has ever seen, so it seems petty when he tries to have his cake and eat it too. There's no need to argue every call. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd probably agree for the most part. Idk about "far better" at passing; Michael was creative/productive as hell when he wanted to be a playmaker. And if Jordan really wanted to, he probably could have averaged 7-10 rebounds a game just to show he could. 

I gotta say I appreciate the way you present your opinion on this. I've run into a lot of LBJ/Cavs fans that refuse to cede anything.  </TEXT>

Some stiff comes along and plays for 20 years and only ever scores off gimme lay-ups because he has a great PG to set him up, tallies 40k points. Is he a great scorer or just an opportunist? I think the greatest scorer all-time is someone who can score at will from anywhere on the floor, regardless of his end total.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The off ball screening is gonna be specific to each offense, as different coaches will want different angles or posture. As for getting space, Kobe and MJ are the best of the best. Watch their footwork, look how they pivot and attack the defender's lead foot, hip, or shoulder. Stepback jumpers are your friend. Kobe against Battier, Artest, or Tony Allen or MJ against Starks, Dumars, or Moncrief would be good places to start. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So according to you, a team winning more than 50 games in a given season -- which happens every year -- means that the given decade is "watered down"? Jesus fucking Christ that sounds so stupid Kyrie might believe it. 

And according to you, taking a team with shitty players (that didn't become All-Stars, mind you) to the Finals = elevating their level of talent. Mo Williams is literally the ONLY non-cornerstone All-Star to play with LeBron in 2009. Boobie Gibson, Sasha Pavlovic, and Anderson Varejao washed out of the league, James didn't ELEVATE them in any substantial/lasting way.

<TEXT> You're not addressing my point. After overcoming the Celtics and Pistons (two teams who repeated as champions and are regarded as some of the greatest teams ever), Michael never lost again in the playoffs in a full season. 

LeBron never lost in the first round because he got to play cupcakes like the Wizards from 2006-2008, the 39-win Pistons in 2009, and the 41-win Bulls before leaving for Miami. 

I'm not sure if you are understanding that LeBron had far weaker first round opponents during his first stint with Cleveland.

EDIT: Also worth noting that, no, LeBron never played a 67 win team. In 2006 they won 64 games. And apparently KG was in his prime from 2008-2012 lmao </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wrote about Black Flag, The Clash, Sex Pistols, Ramones, etc. Insomniac is certainly their hardest, rawest, purest iteration of punk rock (Geek Stink Breath, Brain Stew, etc.) but it still has sing-along, poppy songs like Stuck With Me and 86. The main distinction between them and older punk rock outfits is commercial success, but it also has to do with their target audience. 22 years later they're still trying to attract the same demographic "misfit" teens. No disrespect, if you have a working formula then by all means, but I've certainly outgrown that demographic by now which is why I prefer their early stuff. </TEXT>

Honestly, the Knicks don't need to run it, but given that Melo is a strong iso player, you would expect him to be able to work out of the post like Kobe/MJ/Shaq.

<TEXT> I'll dispense with the "f you's" if you can dispense with the condescending tone. You're not Jerry West, and there's no gold star next to your name that says you know any more about basketball than anyone else here. I actually like the direction we're going with this so here's my rebuttal.

I am familiar with the idea of Positionless Basketball, having played in a HS system that was set up that way and written at length about its place in the future of basketball. The first problem, however, is that to be truly "positionless" we'd have to dispense with the idea of G-F-C. This may be the case in 20-30 years when everyone has the same skill-set and is between 6'6" and 6'8", but for the time being it makes no sense when Rondo and Klay have decidedly different skill-sets. We're just not there yet.

Second, this has more to do with the sentimental side of the game, but if you've played you know that the PG is considered the QB of the offense. No, this does not mean you make every assist or drive every time you have the ball. It means you're the vocal/motivational leader.  If the coach needs something done, he goes to his point guard, regardless of whether he is 5'9" or 6'9". It's a title, an honorary position.

Third, I'm a basketball historian, and even if the game moves in a certain direction in the future, we still need a frame of reference to compare players. I'm not going to lump Iverson in with Bob Cousy just because they were the same height or both guards, we need to be more specific and that's why AI was a SG and Cousy was one of the first true PG's. Hence my reference to 1954, because skilled players were so rare back then that it would be moot to call anyone a PG vs. SG.

If we're going to dispense with PG/SG distinctions, then we better do the same for SF and PF. But clearly T-Mac and Duncan did not play the same position. There have been hundreds of multi-skilled players over the course of the league's 70 years, but they still need to be categorized for history's sake. Far be it from us -- mostly fans -- to determine when and where we stop using specific terminology. 

EDIT: One last thing, if playing off the ball is one of two unique skill-sets required of guards, then literally all four players without the ball are non-guards for the split second they don't have the ball. Sounds awful pointless, which is why you're clearly oversimplifying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Next time I'll say go fuck yourself and call my beloved Point Guard that which I please. Kobe and MJ had all the skills of a PG too but historical accuracy calls for us to recognize them as SG's. This isn't 1954. All guards aren't within three inches of each other. 

The role of a PG is to facilitate the offense. The role of a SG is to shoot the basketball. No one ever said players can't fulfill both roles, but for the sake of consistency, we call someone like Russell a PG because Nick Young can't facilitate the offense. Russell is also a better shooter than Clarkson, ergo we call him the SG when the two are on the floor together. 

His ability to drop 40 points isn't mitigated by what position he is listed at in the box score, so it shouldn't matter to you what I or other fans call him. He is my Point Guard. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As many of you know basketball-reference.com is a great resource but lacks a lot of information from early NBA history -- namely starting lineups. I'm starting a project that will hopefully involve me interviewing former players from the league's early years to discern and preserve whatever information/memories/nuggets of wisdom they can provide. I've already sent inquiry emails out to several organizations (e.g. ESPN, SI, BR, NBA). Was wondering if anyone else could help me out or has connections that could get me in touch with some former players? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everything has to be taken in context. At the time he was the best teammate, defender, and winner of all-time, all this going head-to-head with literally Goliath (Wilt) and winning almost every time. His historical legacy is the biggest part of the argument for his ranking. Think of it like older movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey. Modern CGI and capabilities blow it out of the water, but you wouldn't have Star Wars Episodes 1-3/7-9 without it, which is why it still ranks so highly on all-time lists. Russell paved the way for everyone that came after, and that's why we remember him. </TEXT>

Edit: lmao this is fun. Rewrite the record books all you want, the 2015 Warriors and 2007 Spurs are still champions. Nothing you say or think can change that. You want an easy championship? Look at the 1976 Celtics. The best team they beat was the Cavs w 49/82 wins </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dwight Howard is mentally soft. Fragile. Scared of the big moment. Anti-clutch. You name it. This has been proven time and time again (2009 Finals, 2013 with Lakers, etc.). I'm not going around saying anything novel that hasn't been said before, and I'm not labeling anyone else, just him. So why are you taking issue? Moreover, why not refute the argument? You are no more an authority on basketball than anyone else here, so you calling the statement stupid is just lazy. </TEXT>

CB literally carried the Raptors to the playoffs, Grant never had the kind of talent or reputation. All-time role players? Shane Battier's ability to play defense made him way more valuable than spot-up shooters, Tristan Thompson is a better rebounder than anyone MJ had outside of Rodman. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Definitely watch it, one of the best movies I've ever seen. The idea is that if something isn't unanimous, people can be swayed in either direction -- just like a courtroom verdict. Obviously we can't measure 100% of all basketball fans around the world for their opinion, so the GOAT needs to be agreed upon by an overwhelming majority. 

As time progresses, these opinions may shift depending on what people value more. If we ever get to an era where 3-pt ability is the end-all-be-all, then MJ will lose his luster, but based on what the current iteration of basketball calls for, he is the greatest.

Addressing your point of multiple players winning every single year and so on, the GOAT eventually comes down to head-to-head records (which is why players voted Russell as MVP year after year because his Celtics always beat Wilt's Warriors/76ers). As you can see, the criteria goes in cycles. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok two actual points I want to make. 

1) If you've seen the movie, you know about how the one guy holds onto his prejudice until the very end when he is the overwhelming minority. At that point the paradigm has already shifted and he knows he's wrong. With MJ/LBJ I'd say it's probably like 9-10 jurors in favor of MJ and 2-3 in favor of LBJ. 

2) You have to look at it in the context of time periods. Wilt was by far the GOAT that had ever come along (sorry Celtics fans, Wilt was more talented than Russell and the league only had 8 teams). By the time MJ arrived, everyone who'd watched Wilt was 20-30 years older and probably set in their ways or not a part of the discussion. Did Michael break Wilt's records? No, but he dominated in a more modern era with better competition and improved skills. The game changes, and over time certain skills become more impressive/valuable -- same reason people were including Steph in the convo last year prematurely. In LeBron's career, efficiency has been a major factor in determining greatness since we were coming off an era where hero ball was widespread (T-Mac, Iverson, etc.)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Forgive me for being jaded and used to being downvoted so much that it hardly matters. I respect the hell out of LeBron for the player he is, but the fact of the matter is he and his fans are trying to dethrone a guy who obliterated everything in his path en route to becoming GOAT. For LeBron to surpass him it has to be unanimous and indisputable -- enough to change the minds of people old enough to remember Kareem and Magic and Bird also -- otherwise it's just personal preference. Think of it as 12 Angry Men; if there's any room for doubt, the verdict can be overturned. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok you want a rebuttal? 

There is literally no way to make this a fair argument because MJ never had a chance to play a team as good as the Warriors because his Bulls were too busy kicking the crap out of the rest of the league. And he still managed to defeat two 64-win teams in the Finals (Seattle and Utah '97) and two 62-win teams (Phoenix and Utah '98). 

If beating the Warriors is the feather in LBJ's cap, then it stands to reason that it must be something MJ could not do -- otherwise the argument is a wash. We will never know if MJ could have done it (personally I think he could), so I submit that if you want to dethrone the GOAT you need to have a multitude of indisputable arguments in addition to LBJ beating the Warriors. 

Currently, MJ has rings, MVPs, Finals MVPs, scoring average, the ability to average a triple-double at will, the greatest one-minute stretch to finish an NBA Finals, DPOY, cultural influence, seven straight scoring titles, "shoot it you fucking midget," playoff record points in a game, total points in a game between he and LBJ, an NCAA championship-winning basket, the ability to hit .200 after not having played baseball since HS, and I'm done. 

If you're willing to ignore all that, then I'm really wasting my own time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> See my edit in my latest response to Prophet. Annointing LBJ based on beating the Warriors punishes MJ for never having the chance to play a team that good -- his team WAS that good.

I'm not sure if we're on the same page with the zone D idea...teams aren't allowed to use zone D's anymore (3 second rule), which is why driving is easier today than opposed to 20 years when a shotblocker could camp out in the paint. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand and appreciate that you're trying. The issue, which the other guy who responded to me mentioned, is that weighing these particular accomplishments is completely subjective. Where you have them at 100oz. and 98oz., someone else might have LBJ at 96 or 95, all extremely impressive and probably qualify him as 2ndGOAT, but inconsistent and far from unanimous. If he hopes to dethrone MJ, it MUST be unanimous, meaning he'll need more than just 1 or 2 more oz., he needs an entire cup, something irrefutable that cannot be mitigated.

EDIT: I also feel like it's worth acknowledging that making a win over the Warriors the deciding factor punishes MJ for never having a chance to play a team that good. His Bulls WERE that team. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As for your last sentence, you could also point to current zone defense rules as making it easier to drive. I agree with you that it is very subjective as to which feats you give more weight to, and this is why a discussion/debate like this will likely never be unanimous. My larger point, as you can see in my second response to Prophet, is that if LeBron is unanimously known as #2 now and MJ is #1, then beating the Warriors should only TIE them, not allow LeBron to leapfrog Michael. And to refute my original point, a feat like beating the Warriors cannot be the sole catalyst for dethroning the GOAT; there need to be multiple, indisputable feats that make it clear that a new GOAT has arrived. Otherwise they might as well just be 1a and 1b. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In elementary school we had movie nights where everyone brings a sleeping bag and watches something like Flubber in the MPR. I had a Lion King sleeping bag, and when it came time to clean up and leave I was walking back and noticed someone had already folded it up. Not sure why, but I shook it out just for good measure. Turns out it was some other girl's who had a matching sleeping bag. I just derped away without apologizing and here I am 18 years later still thinking about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find it funny that you derive enjoyment from poking your nose into something that was over yesterday. I was downvoted. I got the picture. People disagreed. I moved on. I don't mind people commenting, it's pricks like you who feel the need to prolong something like this well after the point is moot. Please tell me what you're trying to prove because at this point you're just being a douche. Not that I mind, there's nothing good on TV. You wanna talk about the Earth being flat or something? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not a fucking argument, it's an opinion. I'm not asking you to agree with me. I never asked you to get involved in the first place. IDK what your prerogative is or what you're trying to prove. I don't care anymore. Not sure what "new facts" I invented by suggesting Kwame Brown is a bust, but if you seriously feel the need to continue this then by all means. The point was moot 18 hours ago so I hope it makes you feel better to rail against Kobe like he personally offended you by playing in the NBA. God forbid a Lakers fan like myself roots for or cherishes the memory one of my team's greatest players. But then again here we are in r/NBA where it's considered heresy if I don't worship LBJ.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Man, you must be Kwame's biggest fan, because I've never seen someone go to these lengths to defend his lack of basketball talent. Let's get surgical. None of the guys you've listed were drafted #1 overall and had as much stigma for sucking. Hickson was actually serviceable for a few years in the league and that was actually 73 games in 2010. Gooden averaged double figures most of his career. Brown only started 20 games next to LBJ. Snow was at the tail end of a career where he actually averaged 7 assists a couple years. Pavlovic posted a DWS of 2.3 in 2007, better than all but one of Kwame's seasons -- presumably Mike Brown kept starting him because he earned that spot with his defense. In 12 pitiful years, there is no proof that Kwame contributed anything meaningful on either end of the floor. In the words of Stephen A, the guy's a "bonafide scrub." He wasn't just bad in the NBA, Kwame Brown was bad at playing the game of basketball. I'm sorry, but you're just not going to convince me otherwise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Stretch them all you want, completely ignoring that Robinson was one of the best defensive centers in the league his entire career, but you're right...he's practically Kwame Brown.

And by all means, let's ignore the impact of having a 6'9" Tayshaun Prince with a 7'2" wingspan guard Kobe all series. In the 2003 playoffs, Tim had the advantage of being guarded by (in order) a rookie Amare, a 32-year-old Horry, Dirk, and K-Mart. I'll throw you a bone, K-Mart was a solid defender but gave up 2 inches and nearly 20 lbs to Tim.

And as for this "historically great supporting cast," Malone and Payton were shells of their former selves. No one else in the rotation took more than 3 shots a game. League average PER is 15...guys 5-10 peaked at 13.6. 

This actually is pretty fun, keep going pal. </TEXT>

Over the course of these nine books, the focus shifts to different main characters a couple times -- similar to George R.R. Martin I suppose. I guess my question is how do you feel about this sort of practice? Is it ok to impart my life experiences separately into several of these characters? Does it negate the plot at all to splice it among so many different players? </TEXT>
