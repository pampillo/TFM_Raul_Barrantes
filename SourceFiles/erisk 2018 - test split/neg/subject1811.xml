<TITLE> A Phone Call I Received in the Dead of Night </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 23:55:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> *The phone rang deep in the house and brought me into the real world. I tiredly looked around the desk that I had just accidentally fallen asleep on. I seemed to have forgotten the phone because when it rang again I almost fell from my chair.*

*I stood up, then walked out of the door and down to the foyer to where the phone was still ringing. I grabbed the phone and raised it to my ear, looking intently out the front door at the night.*



**David! What are Oh my god.**
	
Whats wrong honey? Whys your voice sound so scared?

**Oh, its, its nothing David. Nothings wrong with me. Anything wrong with you, you sound a bit worried.**
	
Nah. Why did you call me this early? Its 7:58. No. Damn. Its 1:56 AM.

**It is? David? What happened, did I wake you up? Its like 10:00 right now.**
	
No, we had this conversation yesterday, right?

**No, we didnt. What are you talking about?**

No you! Ok I mustve hit my head or something. I have this massive headache.

**David, you gotta go see the doctor. Theyll help you out, with everything.**
	
No! I dont know what I did. I probably didnt hit my head. I just dont know.

**You just said-**
	
I, this, this happened before. We had this same damn conversation yesterday.

**David? We didnt. Something is wrong with you.**
	
Shut up. We did.

**We didnt-**

Shut up!

**David. Go see someone, get out of the house before you hurt anyone.**
	
Why?

**I hate to see you like this, dont hurt the kids. Please.**
	
I just want to Stop telling me what to do.

**Im not telling you to do anything. I dont know what is wrong with you.**
	
Yeah, you dont. Youre in Florida on a business trip. Not here. Im home. Yes, its just me and the kids. You cant know whats wrong with me if your not here.

**David-**
	
I must be drunk right now.

**Just sit down.**
	
I can stand.

**David-**
	
I. Can. Stand. I am fine.

**Im calling 911.**

No, Im fine. Please. Keep talking to me.

**No I have to call them.**
	
Please, look I am calming down.

**But something is wrong with you.**
	
So what are you doing right now in Florida?

**What am I doing? I listening to you going insane.**
	
Im not going insane. Im just a bit drunk. But look, Im better now. Stay on the phone, dont call 911.

**Stop talking to me like that. Go, leave, go away.**
	
You called me.

**I never called you.**
	
But I am talking with you right now.

**I havent called you.**


*Mrs. Jackson, so you are telling me what exactly. Sorry I missed what you said; it seemed a bit strange.*
	
*It was. So I just got home. It was 1:56 in the morning. I came home from a small party that I went to with my college friends. And there he was. David walked into the foyer of our house and started holding the phone to his head. I started asking him what he was doing, but at that point I saw the needle still stuck in his skin. He was injecting some sort of drug into himself. It turned him into a monster. I kept a conversation with him for a while, but at one point he just was too mad and began beating me with his fists.*
	
*So, howd he end up dead?*

<TEXT> "So the offer?", I questioned him, "Who's house am I delivering it to?"

"It's not in your room to question me, and you will not know where you are going until you get a text sometime in the next few days."

A pause.

He continued, "When you get there, all you need to do is drop off the package on the front door, ring the doorbell, and leave. Don't open the bag, don't stay on the porch, and *do not* look into why you are doing this."

For some reason, my eyes started to tear up. What the hell am I getting myself into? It sounds like I'm dropping off a bomb at this house. But nevertheless I was stuck, "I'll do it."

His cheery smile returned to his face and he said, "Great! The package is in the Audi. It's parked the next street down on the corner. And thank you." He nodded to himself then turned away. Before he disappeared from my sight he turned around and shouted to me, "Enjoy your money!"

I turned away from him and started towards my house, when I remembered the Audi. Sure enough, there was a dark blue, two door Audi parked on the corner of the road. For the next week I didn't spend any of the money and I only drove the Audi once- and that was only to take it home. Max's dark grimace never left my mind and two days after I received my threat I started having nightmares with Max as the central orchestrator in my doom. Finally I broke, I had to spend the money. To keep it simple to explain, I dug myself in a deep money hole.

And then that fateful day hit. I was out with one of my friends. We were bored so I got in her car and we drove around the city. When she got to my house to pick me up I could tell she saw the Audi, but she didn't mention it. Did she put the two-and-two together? Probably not, as I could barely believe that I had an Audi parked at my house (even considering the conditions).

So we were driving when I received a text. Three words. 121 Crimson Place. For a few minutes I fell into a strange silence. Then I alerted my friend to drive me home.

"Immediately," I said.

"For what?" She countered.

"My credit card."

"I told you not to involve yourself with that."

"Yes, I know it was a mistake. Now drive me to my house."

She did, albeit slowly, but she did. Would Max be angry at my sluggish pace? Shit.

I got in the Audi. The key was still in the ignition. I sat down and floored the gas, not bothering to put on my seatbelt or worry what was in the bag. The Audi had a built in GPS, so I plugged in the address and to my joy, the house was only five minutes away. Turns out five minutes seems like a lifetime if you're as scared as I was. Every turn I made to get closer to the house my fear grew ever more.

The houses turned from low class to high class and beyond. When I turned onto Crimson Place, there was only two houses on the small road. The closest, 123, was a tall gothic building. It looked like a haunted house from some cheesy horror cartoon. My main focus, however, was 121 Crimson Place. Damn... that place looked like Bill Gates put all of his money into it. It is safe to say that at least a hundred of my apartments could fit comfortable in that house.

I decided to get it over with so I idled the car on the curb and opened the trunk. Inside was a small yellow bag. It looked normal enough; like a gym bag. When I picked it up it felt surprisingly light and empty. I threw the bag over my shoulder and walked up the path to the front door. I tried to appear normal enough, but that was before I heard the blood curdling scream coming from inside the massive house.

<TEXT> My first impression, even before reading, was that the paragraphs were way to long. This is coming from someone who likes to read and is used to longer paragraphs. But I feel that long paragraphs make readers bored and skip the center of paragraph.

When actually started reading the paragraph I felt it flowed nicely and was very descriptive. Going back to my last point, you could separate the 1st paragraph starting at *In the gloom from the starless night...*

The next two paragraphs were pretty good, although you used some cliche words such as "he could feel his heartbeat pounding" and "Cold sweat". This is just my personal preference that cliche words should be limited, and most people don't care or even notice. So, honestly, this is just my commentary on it.

I'm going to bunch the next few paragraphs together and say that I am pretty confused on what exactly is going on. I assume (most definitely) that you just haven't gotten to the point in the story where they are explained.

And honestly the ending felt a bit rushed. I'm not sure why but the "keeping your soul" part just didn't flow right. It was too abrupt. And finally, the climax and resolution was a little lackluster. This combines with the ending feeling a little rushed to make a average ending; not an amazing one.

I'm sorry if this is a bit short, but your story was well written and the only *major* flaw to me was the ending.

~~Good luck, in the rest of your writing.~~ Damn, I just looked up to your description and saw the "part 2" part. Well, good luck in writing the next part of story! </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Lighthouse Keeper's Journal: Winter of 1842 [Part 1] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-04 16:56:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Part 2 has been edited into this part, due to the length.

A Note from the Author: 
*These are the journal entries of Bruno Frei. They were found hidden away at the top of a lighthouse that is located on a barren cliff in Canada. As it was written in 1842, the short passages have been slightly modified so that they are easier to read in modern English. Finally, the events that took place that winter are not proven and should not be taken as fact; these could very well be hallucinations or writings to pass the time.*

___
__December 27, 1842__

The days go by and the hope of leaving seems to fade. The cold has started to permeate through the walls. I ask my Otto what we should do about our situation, even though I know that the question is meaningless. The repetition I face everyday makes me want to fall from sanity. We are stuck.

We are stuck.

___
__December 28, 1842__

I suppose I should write out our backgrounds. Yesterday I was not in the right state of mind. I am Bruno Frei, of German descent and Otto Jans also is of German descent. We both were immigrated to Canada and we were living well for a while. And then we found ourselves without work and thus here we are, as lighthouse keepers.
Fifteen days heretofore a massive ice storm struck the lighthouse and froze the water. Otto and I are cut off from the rest of the world until winter ends and the ice thaws. We have so many days until spring. 

___
__December 29, 1842__
	
I am writing todays entry in the lamplight after todays event had already taken place. I am going to be frank; Ottos mind is starting to deteriorate.

This morning I woke up to find Otto already awoken. He was staring out of the single window on the ground floor. Even from across the room I could hear his heavy breathing. But I ignored the signs of a man who had gone mad and traveled across the room to eat a breakfast of stale bread.

As I slowly ate the bread I heard him grunt and say, Dont touch my bloody journal.

I bit the side of my mouth in confusion and replied, I never touched your stuff.

I woke up an hour ago and it wasnt beside my bed. So I searched everywhere in this lighthouse to no avail. And do you want to know where you put it? Out in the snow. I repeat, do not touch anything of mine. And do not (at this point, Otto was nearly shouting) put anything out in the snow! I figured saying anything would just make the situation worse, so I said nothing.

Today I assumed the duties of maintaining the main light of the lighthouse. Every other day Otto and I would switch. Today he had to do nothing, which was a terrible thing. Boredom can be horrific.

The view from the top of the tower was awe striking at one point, but now the constant swell of snow prevents me from seeing farther than a couple strides from the tower. 

Around an hour past sunset I climbed up the short ladder to a small nook in ceiling. In it I kept various pictures that I drew to keep myself from becoming insane. But today they werent there. Jumping to a conclusion, I thought that this was revenge for what I had supposedly done to Otto. So I stormed down the narrow spiral staircase and found Otto sleeping on the ground.
	
I furiously roused him awake and after having a tense conversation with him, I decided he didnt do anything to my papers. I can tell when he lies.
	
So today, I managed to steal Ottos journal and have my drawings get stolen.
	
I cannot wait to leave. Spring must come sooner.

___
__December 30, 1842__
	
What is going on?
	
Ghosts?
	
There are voices.
	
Otto?
	
They say, 1827.
	
1827.

What is Otto doing?

Ghosts?

___
__December 31, 1842__
	
He says that he heard them to, but I think he is just trying to frighten me. The way he holds himself is of confidence.
	
I am writing this entry at breakfast today, I dont want to deal with writing down how Otto frightens me today. It just makes me more fearful. Across from the small table Otto is trying to make small talk, but I cant talk to someone who is doing this to me.
	
I am putting this journal away.
	
What is Otto doing?
	
____
__January 1, 1843__

Otto does not like me anymore. Every time I say something to him he just stares at me and mumbles something back. Is he hiding something?

But I have my suspicions.
	
For the past two days and today various things around the lighthouse are being moved around. There was a ball of rope that normally rested on a shelf on the way up to the top of the tower. On the 30th, that rope was untangled around the ground floor. Otto feigned innocence, but I know it was he. It had to be.
	
On the 31st, a butcher knife we had was stabbed into the wood lining the window. When I pulled it out, I noticed that the knife pierced out of the lighthouse to the outside world. I had to seal it up, by shoving some fabric into the thin slice. Otto feigned innocence to that.
	
And on the 1st of the New Year, which was today, I awoke with no blankets covering me at all. It was in the dead of night. There were no lights on. The lighthouse creaked in the wind. Footsteps seemed to sound from the floorboards. There was a small lamp that I kept beside me at night. I used to not keep a lamp there and then the voices started. I lit the lamp.
	
Shadows danced due to the flickering of the lamp. Otto flipped over in his bed. My blankets were gone and there was no chance that I would go searching for them in the dark of night.
	
When I awoke, Otto feigned innocence. He acted confused, he acted worried. He would make a good actor for a play. I searched through all of the rooms and did not find them.
	
They were outside. A warm fire melted the snow off of them. 
	
Now, I am going to write this next part down in the hope that Otto does not read this journal. 
	
I think Otto is trying to get me to go mad. 
	
But what did I do to merit that?
	
Does he think that this is a game?
	
___
__January 2, 1843__
	
I found something. I was up in the top of the tower today, working the light. In my boredom I was running my hand across the bricks on the wall, when my fingers ran into something along the wall.
	
After a quick inspection of the brick I found out that it could swing open.
	
A secret compartment.
	
I opened the small compartment and in it a journal sat. I carefully pulled the slim book out of the compartment and gently inspected the outside.
	
It was maroon which golden words printed on the front. A Book for Thoughts. It was a journal. But who's?
	
I opened it up and written in elaborate lettering was the name Isaac Walker. I carefully fingered the frail paper and flipped to the next page. On the top was the date January 4. Then there was a rumbling of the metal staircase to the top of the tower. I hurriedly shoved the journal into the wall and properly hid it. Otto reached the top of the stairs just as I faked looking out the window at the constant blizzard.
	
He growled softly, Whatve you been doing up here.
	
Nothing, Otto, said I. He didnt believe me, but he let it drop. I am not going to go through the entire length of the conversation, but to sum it up he attempted to reconcile to me about the past few days. He never apologized for moving things around the lighthouse, but he apologized for the lack of talking.
	
I dont know if this is petty, but I never apologized back.
	
I will apologize when he stops moving things around in the night.
	
____
__January 3, 1843__

For the first time, nothing moved around last night. And today Otto and myself seemed to be at peace with one another. Nothing much happened at all. All day I was on edge that something was going to happen. There is such a tense feeling around the lighthouse today.
	
____
__January 4, 1843__
	
After dealing with the maintenance of the light I am ready to read the journal. I dont want to lose anything about the mysterious journal, so I will be copying everything down into this journal. And as the days line up, I will be reading a passage a day and writing it down into this journal.
	
January 4, 1827

I am writing in this journal not in the hope that it will help me, but in the hope that I can record what is happening to me. Maybe this will help someone in the future. I am trying to stay calm, but it is getting harder as the days go on.
Just as a quick insight into my situation, I am a lighthouse keeper trapped inside my lighthouse alone. Things are moving around uncontrollably. I hear voices and they seem to say 1816. If I am going insane then so be it. But I fear I am not.
Tonight I am going to risk my supplies and my life. I will keep the lamps on all night. Something just fell down at the bottom of the tower.*
	
The writing stops at that and I forgot to mention that most of the bread was relocated to the top of the tower as I slept. Otto he is still feigning innocence. But I am starting to wonder
	
___
__January 5, 1843__

Something happened, but I have not a clue why. Did Otto and myself anger the spirits? When I woke up, Otto and his bed were gone. There was an empty space where he previously was. I ran up the spiral staircase and there the bed was. It was hung using the rope off of the framework of the lighthouse. And Otto was tied to the bed.
	
I panicked, but after a few minutes of hyperventilating I managed to calm myself down.
	
At first I thought he was dead, but after using the ladder I untied him to find that he merely lost his consciousness. After we had both recovered the bed, we parted. He to the top of the tower and I to the bottom.
	
For any future readers, I would like to say that although it sounds like that didnt frighten me, you are completely mistaken. 
	
I carried the journal down to the ground floor and hid it behind my bed the day before, so here goes:
	
January 5, 1827

The voices are driving me insane. 1816 1816 1816. Just moments ago all the lights had gone out; including the main light for the lighthouse. None of the lamps down here worked, so I had to go to the top of the tower in the dark. Every step I took my fear grew.
Must my brain be so faulted? When I reached the summit I saw a dark shape move, closer, closer, closer. But when I turned the light on, there was nothing. I swear by the light of the moon that I was not imagining anything.
I fear I may not be able to muster the courage to go up to the top for a while. My emotions seem to be more important than my duty.

I would like to write out that I am now pretty worried. What happened to him, could happen to me.
	
____
__January 6, 1843__
	  
The voices have been driving me insane. All through the day and into the night. 1827. 1827. 1827. But a moment ago all the lights had gone out; including the main light for the lighthouse. None of the lamps down here worked, so I had to go to the top of the tower in the dark. Every step I took my fear grew. When I thought back to the journal my eyes got tear filled.
	
Otto looks fine. I cannot concentrate. I am worried. I must continue writing this out. This could save someone yet to come.
	
I have decided to quote the previous journal entry, as my experience is the same as he: Must my brain be so faulted? When I reached the summit I saw a dark shape move, closer, closer, closer. But when I turned the light on, there was nothing. I swear by the light of the moon that I was not imagining anything.
	
I fear I may not be able to muster the courage to go up to the top for a while. My emotions seem to be more important than my duty. Otto may be the only Lighthouse Keeper.
	
January 6, 1827

God save me.
God save us all.
I am trapped.
I cannot leave.
And I have found another journal from 1827.
I cannot write my findings down. It is too much. I would rather hide the thoughts away, then write them out.
I know my fate and I cannot change it.
I am with tears. I almost feel like I cannot continue.
Maybe I should light the lighthouse on fire? Then no one will have to suffer the same fate as I will.
Hope must be kept.

**January 7, 1843**

The journal from 1827 offers no clue to what his fate will be. I need to know, because I fear that I will have the same fate. I have read through the rest of the journal, only three more days, and it never mentions anything else frightening. Almost as if the writer lost his sanity. I am afraid I will not copy them down, because as mentioned before the writer mustve lost his mind.

Just as an insight into my situation I am currently too scared to leave the ground floor. I fear that I have turned into a lady living in a mans body but I cannot help it. Otto spends his entire day at the peak and never mentions the day with the bed.

My hair has started greying. From stress I assume.

But the worst part of all of this is my left hand, which I seem to have lost control to. If I attempt to curl my hand into a fist, my fingers only slightly move.

What could this be from?

Cold has spread in from the frigid outside. My breath turns to steam as it exits mouth. How much longer will this suffering last?

Will the ice ever melt?

**January 8, 1843**

*Unfortunately, due to the lack of Jan. 8 we can only assume what must have happened. We can connect that this day was a horrible day for Bruno and that he likely lost much of his mind (as the state of the next entries shows that he was basically insane). Sadly, Bruno assaulted Otto on this day; which is referenced on Jan. 13.*

Stop! Please? The madness.

**January 10, 1843**

What is happening to me? What am I doing? I cant remember anything. Something bad happened. What happened? Help. Otto? Hes gone. To where? I do not know. Whats wrong with this damned lighthouse? I do not know.

___________

**January 11, 1843**

He is back. Otto is back. Was he ever gone?

He doesnt speak to me. Have I done something?

I am starting to feel like my journals are my thoughts put into papers. They are so random, so crazed. Please God, please God

Can you help?

**January 13, 1843**

I know what happened, but I fear that my knowledge will die with me in a short amount of time. I have accepted my fate. I cannot escape it.

I am going to go tell you the story of Thursday the 12th and of today, Friday the 13th, which happens to be the date of my impending death.

Otto was recovering from a knife wound. Did he stab himself? Every time I went to aid him, he would hold up a knife in defense against me. As if I was the one who cut him. I have looked back in my entries and this mustve happened on the 8th, as there seems to be no pages. I cannot bring myself to believe that I did it.

Suddenly, Otto tensed up and I did as he fearing the worst. And dear God, I shouldve been more scared than I was. And then I heard the noises. They were coming from the tower.

Step.

Step.

Step.

They were getting closer and coming from the spiral staircase.

Otto and myself looked to each other. I looked at him for assistance and he looked at me with anger. We couldnt go anywhere. So I did the only thing that I could possibly do. I ran outside.

The evening sun shone from the horizon in all its glory. I could still hear the footsteps on the metal steps. I grasped my ears and collapsed down onto the ground. The sound still penetrated. And then there was a massive wave of sound, sounding like what I can only assume a gun does.

I stood up shakily and made my way to behind the lighthouse. I was upset at everything.

I was frigid in the outside and since the noises had stopped I went back inside. As soon as I got in the door shook behind me and shut, locking itself. I panicked and tried to escape; I couldnt. I sprinted up to the peak of the lighthouse and here I am now.

Hours passed. Nothing happened.

I locked the door into the top.

God, help there, I hear the steps. They are the steps of the phantom.

Each step I hear. With each step my death comes closer.

The phantom has entered the body and mind of Otto. He is hunting me. I fear the phantom had gone into me on the 8th and I stabbed Otto.

When Otto gets up here he will kill me and then he will bring the bloody blade to his chest and stab himself. It has happened before and will happen again.

God damned life! Hes at the door.

The door is (unreadable scribbles)

And here ends the Lighthouse Keepers Journal. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A 911 Call </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-13 02:42:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 

911, what is your emergency.
	
There is someone on my porch, I dont know him, and he wont go away.

Alright, please tell me your current address?
	
12 Twin Bluff Road

Im sending the police now, but I want you to stay with me. Tell me what this man is doing.
	
Im, Im trying to remain calm. Alright, my house sort of juts out on one side, so I am walking to a window in that jut where I can see the front door.

So you are the only one there?
	
Just me and the man.

So what is happening?
	
Nothing as of yet Oh god

What?

The man is sitting there on a chair. He is just smiling at me. Oh god. Oh god.

The police are on their way.

Good. He is just sitting there. Hes not moving. Why is he smiling at me? What is happening, maam?

I dont know. You know what? Move away from the window.

Im not sure that is a good idea.

Why?

What if he tries breaking in my house? Id rather see him.

It is your safety versus your houses. Im going to try to help you.

Ok. Im walking deeper in my house.

I want you to affirm you are the only one there. Often times criminals dont work alone.

I dont hear anything. Im alone in a bathroom. But I can only think about that man. Now that I think about it something was wrong about that man. I need to see him again to tell you what exactly.

The squad car is only five minutes away.

Good, good. Im going to see the porch again.

Are you sure you will be safe?

Yes.

Report what is happening, second-by-second.

I will.

*Silence.*

He is still there. Oh god not again. His pupils, thats what is wrong.

*Silence.*

His smile. Hes got to stop. I swear he hasnt moved since I left. Only his eyes seem to follow me.

You said something was wrong with his pupils.
	
Oh yes, they take up his whole eyes. Almost like dog eyes. Wait, he just cocked his head. His face lost its smile. Oh, no. It is back again.

Three minutes and the police will arrive.

He just got up. He mouthed something:
		
Should I sit down or stand. Do you want me to come in.

No, no, no, no. Oh, good. He sat back down.
		
*Silence.*

What is happening?

Nothing. He is smiling at me. Not moving. Oh no. I hear creaking in my house.

Quickly now. Get to a bathroom. Lock yourself in it.
	
Im pretty much sprinting there. The creaking has stopped.

Doesnt matter, lock yourself in the bathroom.

I wasnt ever thinking of not doing it.
			
*Click.*
	
Im locked in. Im safe.

*The phone falls silent. Nothing is heard.*

Hello? You still there?

*Silence.*

Sir?
			
*Silence.*

Hello?

*The cutting edge of silence, the edge of something which is so calm.*
		
*The bloodied blade. Silence.*

Sir! Are you there?

**The call ends.**

*Police cars arrive the next day. There is an investigation that same day.*

*A police report says: After investigation, we found out that the man in question was lured into the bathroom, where the murderer was waiting silently behind the shower curtains.*

She ran.

*The 911 operator was found to be working with the criminals. The audio recordings show that she claims to have sent a police car. We urge citizens to call 911 in the event of any emergency. The events that took place that night were an isolated incident. But nevertheless we are running full investigations in the agency.*

She ran. She was never caught.
	
He died that fateful day.

*Silence lived on.*

*Silence.*
