<TITLE> Why Do You Want To Fap? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Seriously, why? Because it makes you feel good? No, that's not a reason. Dopamine can be derived from any satisfying thing from soda or exercise. Saying "I want to feel good" is not an argument. There is no real reason to masturbate besides a slight decrease in the chance of procuring prostate cancer. However, there are hundreds of reasons not to masturbate as cataloged on this page (confidence boost, better concentration, etc.). It is illogical to do it, so don't.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Listen guys, I dont have a lot of time. My phone is the only access I have to the outside world, and all it has is some shitty wifi connection. Im not sure if Im going to get out of here alive, and if I dont, you wont be around for much longer either. 

We designed a biological weapon, a disease thats growth sprawls all over your brain. Its fast acting, only taking 10-15 minutes to take over your mind. Once it does, it sends you into a hallucinogenic state. Your body starts convulsing into a constant state of horrific pain, it alters your brain chemistry to send you into a psychopathic state, your fight or flight responses kick in, making you attack all living creatures nearby. 

I hate my job, I wanted to design medicine. Ever since I was a little kid, I would play doctor with my mom and pretend to heal her of any diseases. I would give anything to be back there instead of the living Hell that entraps me. 

Big surprise, death found a way to prevail. Butt-fuck Benny, my lab assistant, somehow found his way onto my computer. I never told him the password, but I guess stupidity can work wonders. He wanted to see the disease for himself, so he unlocked the chamber remotely from my desktop. 

He got to see the disease alright, and so did the labs secretary when a screaming and convulsing Benny ripped her tongue straight out from between her teeth. It didnt take long for campus security to put Benny down, but they didnt know the dangers of what they encountered. 

The idiots shot Benny in the head, the worst thing you could do to a fungal infection. The spores spread into the air, infecting anyone in the 20 foot proximity. 

Meanwhile, I was at my desk, doing some paperwork when I got the email. I knew what was about to happen. I locked my door and stacked my chair and desk against it. The door and its hinges were made out of some titanium-steel alloy, but the feeling of security felt nice. I sat in the middle of the floor and waited for the screams to commence.

And they did.

It was like a symphony straight from Satans choir. Male and female voices joined each other in the perfect symbiosis of agony and wretched gasps for breath. I heard the pounding of fists and the tearing of flesh no more than a few feet outside my door. They were killing each other. 

While working in a factory of death, youd think Id be use to death quite literally being at my door. Youd be wrong. Those screams echo in my mind like a catchy 70s love song. The infected individuals outside screamed as though there soul was leaving their bodies. The screams sounded not so much like terror or fear, but a longing. A longing to die, something that wouldnt happen until a week later when the fungus devours the brain. 

Eventually the abrupt thuds of boney knuckles against flesh stopped, and all that was left was the unpunctuated, persistent groans and shrieks of pain. I sat there in the center of the floor praying to anyone that would listen that I would get out of here alive. 

That was yesterday.

My dreams were plagued by the undying screams of the tortured souls clawing at their skin in desperation to get the pain to stop. I wondered about them. Were their conscious minds still active? Were they aware of what they were doing? The pathogen was still under study, we only knew what it did to your body not your soul.

The screams and moans have begun to die down. The afflicted mustve moved on to another area. Thats when I heard it.

NO!!! PLEASE GOD NO!!! a womans voice shrieked from the room 30 feet across from mine.

I peeked through a small, portrait-sized window. I saw a mob of frenzied afflicted had managed to force their way into Doctor Shawanas office. Shawana was the only women in my division, and a cute one too. She had toned legs, a well-kept body, and beautiful wavy black hair. It was a shame to see the black hair practically being ripped from her scalp by a muscular infected security guard. She let out one final scream as she fell to the floor. Thuds landed on her body, scratches and cuts drained her of blood.

She was dead.

I fell upon my knees and vomited onto the floor. After about a minute there were no more fluids left in my body and I was doing nothing but dry heaving. The afflicted heard this and let out painful wretched screams. They charged my door and threw themselves at it. I could hear the crunching of their bones as they broke their limbs and skulls against the metal door. 

Those sounds didnt bother me so much, the noises that really got to me was the screams and footsteps from behind me. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Views on Sin </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-02 12:40:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This isn't directly pertaining to NoFap but more on general sin. However I do think it would be beneficial to share my story to you all. 

Throughout my childhood and up to about 8th grade, I was slowly but surely falling away from my Catholic faith. I was going day to day chasing the next good feeling, whether it was masturbation, unhealthy foods, pornography, or spending hours a day not doing my homework and video gaming/watching TV. I was failing almost all my classes because I was too weak to deal with the stress and didn't care. All I cared about was pleasure, and that is all that defined me. Inevitably, I almost completely fell away from my Catholic faith, even going as far as to say that God hates me. I became severely depressed and plotted multiple ways to commit suicide, which I thought about and revised multiple times. 

My soul was completely drowned in sin. On top of that, I also suffered from sexual deviancy which I will not go into detail about. However, I came out of this wretched part of my life still a virgin and thank God for that everyday.

I woke up and realized that my depression was caused by my sin and my broken relationship with God. The more I strayed away from him, the more I hated myself. After months of recuperation, I have finally begun restoring my faith and improving my relationship with God. 

Now as a sophomore, I have cut out almost all of the sinful parts of my life, and I am eager to live with God as the main priority in my life and placing everything second to him, including myself and my temptations. Now that I am improving my faith, every sin hurts me greatly. It makes me feel like I'm returning to that state where I was living in perpetual sin. I thank God for it, because it provides me an incentive to work harder, but it is a very difficult process.

My advice to you is to place God first. Nothing comes before him. While suffering and pain in your life may be almost unbearable, he is the ultimate salvation. Trust in him, and he will lead you down the righteous path. I love you all, and thank you for reading. I truly hope my story provides some sort of inspiration for you, as it has for me. :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Note To Prevent Relapse </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-02 05:19:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I typed this up on my phone to look at in order to prevent relapse. 

Satan is the one influencing your thoughts and emotions. He is manipulating your depression to make it seem like sin (masturbation) is the only way out, much like he did when Jesus was in the desert for 40 days. He made it seem like he (sin) was the only way to satisfaction. Notice how your emotions and desires drive you to be lustful, angry, and full of despair; all of which are three of the seven deadly sins. God will lead you through this, he wants you to get to Heaven and accept him. He loves you like a parent loves their child. Much like a parent, he wants nothing but success for his child. Ignore the emotions, ignore the temptations of Satan. Place yourself in God's hands. He will take care of you. 

I hope this helps! </TEXT>

<TITLE> 21 Day Check-In! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-30 01:47:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm a 16 male, and I finally reached my 21st day, marking my 3rd week. I have a message for beginning Fapstronauts: It is not impossible. The first 15 days are absolutely the hardest. Having relapsed 5 times, I know how difficult it can be to relapse and start up again. The first week of nofap is slow, with long drawn-out days where all you can think about is fapping. Once you get past your 1st week, the days start to accelerate. By the 2nd week, you will encounter days where you will only be tempted once or twice a day. After day 16, I would have days where I wouldn't think about fapping at all. I am by no means flatlining, but I am finally on the verge of breaking my addiction.

Now this does not come with time alone. There is some work involved. There is a simple philosophy that I employed. You can't fap with people around. My mother is a busy-body, she is always doing yard work or work around the house. Whenever I get the urge, I make it a point to go help her. I won't be able to fap with my mom around, so I know that I'll be safe from it for at least the time I'm helping her. It's the same with hanging out with friends, etc.

The times where you are alone are the hardest. I have a period of about 1 hour and 30 minutes to 2 hours where I am home alone every day. The best thing I can recommend is to work out during this time. Working out can place the sexual energy into something more productive than fapping. If you are not looking to workout, then start something that requires full concentration. I have a female friend who is also doing nofap, and she likes to work on art when she gets the urge. My point is: Find something to do. Whether it's art, video games, listening/playing music, etc. Find something that requires complete devotion of attention.

I hope this helps! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> A relationship is the congregation of 2 people who express affection towards each other. With that being said, there are too many people who are searching for someone to "complete them" or "make them whole". You can't make a relationship with one person and then someone who is half broken. The relationship isn't whole, if the people in it aren't. 

Fix yourself. Make yourself the best you can be, and never stop working for perfection. Do everything in your power to become the best and most fulfilled you can. Not only will your relationship with others improve, but your relationship with yourself will improve as well.  </TEXT>

I will either immediately start helping my mom with something or start working out. That way you know that you're at least not going to fap for the length of whatever activity your engaged in. When that's done, move on to the next thing.

As soon as you get the urge immediately start doing something else. Whether it's video games or working out, do something to distract yourself. I've notice that my urge to masturbate is peaked when I'm not doing anything. Try to keep yourself busy. Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey man, on my 13th day here myself . The easiest way is to immediately do something else as soon as you get the urge. A lot of people recommend working out as soon as you feel the urge coming on, but I personally like to blast music while playing video games.

FINAL PART

I remember what everything was like before that one dreadful morning that I awoke to my wife and kids no longer being in my home. I never told you guys about that did I? Well, I suppose I should. I started off the morning by thanking God for my day off. I saved my wife some time by packing the kids lunches, before sending them off to their bus stops with a kiss on the cheek. Christina and I spent half an hour on the couch cuddled under a blanket. The times alone with each other were the best. It reminded us of when we were first dating. If there really is a Heaven, thatll be it. I guess Ill find out. Ill be there soon.

After taking the shot, and taking a quick picture, I sped off down the alleyway. I tried to scream but no sound came out of my mouth. I tried to cry, but no tears would come. I heard my laptop emit the sound of a received email. The last email I hope to get for a long time.

It gave me a name and the address. The name was ZACHARY and after putting the address into Google, I saw that it led to an old junk yard on the outskirts of town. Zachary must be 000000000, and he was the last person Id have to kill before this sick shit was over. Id be able to see my family again.

I stopped at the gun store one more time. I purchased a revolver, I wasnt going to get in a gunfight with a bolt-action .22. I remember the man asking me what I planned to do with it, and I remember walking out the door not saying a word. 

I was dead tired by the time I finished everything. I went back to the seedy hotel I had taken residence, and fell asleep upon hitting the bed. 

I had nothing but nightmares, seeing my kids being shot in the head by an unstoppable figure. Watching my wife asphyxiate and die from seemingly nothing. My family suffering while a distant voice whispered I hope you find them over and over again.

Despite the terrors that plagued me at night, I awoke at noon. I got up and stepped into the shower. The mirror was fogged by the time I got out. I was relieved. I cant look at what it reflects, all I see is someone who killed an innocent family. Someone who ruined peoples lives for his own personal gain. I couldnt look at that person right now, and honestly I dont think Ill ever be able to.

The drive to the junkyard was only a 30 minute drive, but to me it felt like hours. I shouldve been eager. One pull of the trigger and Id be able to hold my wife in my arms, Id be able to wake my kids up for school. I wasnt though. I felt like I was going to vomit the whole time. 



I made sure to drive past the junkyard to a rest stop half a mile away. If Zachary was still there, I didnt want him to know I was coming. 

It was a short 10 minute walk. The fenced-in junkyard was littered with cars, any one of them could be hiding the grieving man who was more eager to kill me than I was to kill him. I scanned the area and noticed a light being emitted from the broken window of a car.

I crouched down, pistol in hand, and began inching my way to the car. I was about 20 feet away when I noticed that a man was sitting in the drivers seat of the car and the light was coming from his lap.

He wasnt moving. Then the realization hit me. 

As I moved closer, I noticed that the broken window had blood splattered all over it. I got up and walked over to the drivers side door. Upon opening it, Zacharys arm slumped over towards where the door once was. His expressionless face was covered in flies and all sorts of insects. I glanced down and noticed that his phone was on, all it showed was the picture of his dead wife. 

The picture I sent to him.

I realized that after receiving the picture of his dead wife, Zachary had shot himself. 

An uncontrollable rush of tears flooded to my eyes. Im sorry I muttered, Im so sorry

I mustve sat with my back against the car for a good hour. I couldnt help but cry. I couldnt get over the fact that I had killed this man and his family for me. For what I wanted. 

I pulled my digital camera from my pocket and took a picture of the dead man slumped over in his car seat, and sent it to 000000001. 

After a few mintues, my laptop dinged. It was email from 000000001. All it said was Theyll be waiting for you at home.

I didnt head straight home. I stopped at the hotel first. I couldnt go home just yet. I couldnt face my family after what I had done.

This is the 2nd day Ive been in this hotel room. 

The nightmares persistently invade my sleep. They consist of nothing but screams emanating from every direction, and re-runs of me killing Zacharys family, Zachary pleading for me to stop all the while. The nightmares persist even into my awake life. Ill be watching TV or otherwise trying to take my mind off things when a flashback of me ending someones life occurs.

I see my revolver out of the corner of my eye, resting on the table as I type this update. I keep thinking back to Zachary, and how much I envy him. He got to escape all the misery and discomfort with one pull of a trigger. I wonder if hes happy now.

I think Ill ask [him](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tp1XgPqongyYIkPFGJ_tSbuuamNK4NxTKu4NSOMViGg/edit?usp=sharing). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm currently on my longest streak of 10 days. Sure it has been hard, but the effects have already began taking place. Breaking my masturbation addiction (an addiction formed over 6 years) has motivated me in other parts of my life. I've finally gotten my workout routine back on schedule, and have recently taken up writing, something I've always wanted to do.

My message to new Fapstronauts: The benefits of NoFap outweigh the benefits of fapping. I will admit, masturbation served as an instant stress reliever and a way to manage my emotions, however I can say that these 10 days have been some of the most productive 10 days of my life. I have taken control over parts of my life I have been struggling with for years, and have even noticed my confidence increase as well. There is no reason not to give NoFap at least a try. I sincerely hope you do. :) </TEXT>

I guess I should change the name of my story, figuring its not true anymore. I dont have the strength to think of some intro to summarize my thoughts. I honestly dont have the strength to type this update, but Ill try.

My ears were ringing after the bullet left the chamber. Tears were streaming down my face, I just curled up in the dirt and began to sob. What am I doing? I just killed an innocent mother. Someone who would drive her kids to school, just like my wife. Someone who would pack lunches for her husband before work, just like my wife. Someone who would kiss her kids on the forehead before they went to sleep, just like my wife. 

I heard my laptop ding, it was an email. It instructed me to take a picture of the now dead Michelle, and send it to 000000000. If I didnt, then my wife and children would suffer the consequences. This was sick. This was terrible. I had no choice.

It was a lovely day. The sun was shining brightly in a sky sparsely dotted with a puff of fluffy white clouds. Michelle's hair waved in a light breeze, most of it sticking together caked in blood. Thats what the picture on my digital camera showed anyways.

I sent the image to 000000000, along with a message saying how sorry I was. He read it, but didnt respond. I couldnt imagine what he was going through right now. I didnt want to do this. 

I heard sirens in the distance, and figured that it was time to go. I got in my car and sped off away from the scene. I rented a low-rate hotel. I wasnt planning on staying there long. I mostly just wanted a place to sleep without having to worry about getting ticketed. 

It was early, only 8:00PM, but today was long enough. I fell asleep within minutes of lying on the bed, only to find myself within the worst nightmare of my life. 

It was during our honeymoon. I awoke to the sound of the showering running at the opposite end of our hotel suite. Ill slip out of bed in my boxers and step into the doorway to see Christina standing there brushing her teeth in, while wearing one of my t-shirts. I walk up behind her and kiss her neck. She straightens up and turns around, only to reveal her bloodied face caved in from a bullet. 

I woke up dripping with sweat. Red numbers glowed from the clock on the bedside table, indicating that it was 1:30AM. So much for sleeping.

I had received another email in my slumber. It was another address with the name JASMINE typed over it. 

I stayed awake surfing the web and reading news stories reporting on the murder of a woman who was sitting on a hotel balcony. Lucky for me, there was no information on the killer, or even evidence regarding him. I continued to waste time until it was 5:00AM, when I decided to begin my disgusting errand. 

During the drive to the address provided, I kept looking over at the picture of 000000000's family. I glanced from daughter to daughter, wondering which one was Jasmine. I felt like I was going to vomit the entire drive. I just kept telling myself that I had no choice. My family or his. My family or his.

My family or his.

I couldnt bring a giant hunting rifle into the hospital, so I walked in unarmed. I was sweating profusely, my vision blurred with the tears flooding my eyes. I pulled my hood over my head to conceal my expression. I walked up to front desk and asked for a map of the place. I told her I was looking for the hospice ward (I couldnt let her know that I was actually looking for the childs ward).

She gave me a print out map, I thanked her and made my way to the childs ward. The email came with a room number CW14. I passed by numerous rooms, each yielding their sad environment of sick children next to sobbing parents, until I got to room 14. I peered through the rectangular window into the room. I couldnt see much of the child except for her feet. No one else was in the room.

I walked in and was met with a tragic sight. The child was hooked up to a ventilator, amongst a variety of other beeping and whirring machines; all of which were linked directly to her body through a variety of cords. I collapsed into a chair just opposite of the bed. My cheeks were puffy and red with tears, my breath was nothing but short, abrupt gasps. 

The flowers on her bedside table were beautiful. A mixture of violets and tulips and babys breath. They lay there, staring neutrally up towards the fake luminescent bulbs. They gave a slight jostle when all the cords underneath them were pulled out from the wall. They lit up from the flash emitted by my digital camera.

I screamed the entire car ride back to my hotel. I screamed and cried until my voice when hoarse. 

What am I doing? 

I didnt sleep at all that night. I dont think I will for many more nights to come. The next morning was spent vomiting any food I tried to swallow. One more. I just have to get one more.

The only thing I took solace in was the fact that I hadnt received any pictures of possibly dead members of my family from 000000000. In fact, I havent received any messages from him period. He was reading my messages instantly upon receiving them, but never responding.

I received an email from 000000001, the last email I hope to ever get from her. It was an address with the final name above it: ISABELLE

I checked my local news website, and saw that a nurse had come across Jasmine dead in her bed. I made sure to plug all the wires back in, so it wouldnt look like they were tampered with. They chalked it up to machinery failure. There were pictures of the cords, stock images of hospital beds, and of the crying nurse; someone elses life Ive now ruined. 

The drive to Isabelles location was a somber one. Whatever emotions I wouldve felt before are now gone. I dont know if sociopathy can be acquired, but I know that my emotions are dead, which is close enough. I arrived at the destination.

It was a park, and I saw a little girl rocking gently on the swing. The same smiling little girl from the picture on my laptop. 

I pulled into an alleyway opposite of the park. The trunk popped open. The rifle came out. 

The shadow provided by the building provided a cool temperature, shielding me from the sun. I saw a little boy sitting on his mothers lap, both of them smiling taking turns spooning ice cream from a bowl. Another child was building up courage to go down the big slide, his father cheering him on from below. A young couple was playing fetch with what looked like a German Shepard puppy. I wondered which one of them would hear the shot first. Which one would notice the spurt of blood through the air.

My finger tensed around the trigger.

Im sorry.

Sometimes Ill go back and read my first post, and wish I was back there. When my situation was still simple, and I could wrap my head around the idea that I was just some crazy guy who imagined his whole family. I know thats not the case now. I know what I need to do.

I didnt do much after posting my last update. I just drove to a nearby McDonald's and ordered some food, then sat there until they kicked me out. I was there for a few hours, doing nothing but trying to lose myself in some video games I had on my computer. 

It was about noon when I was finally kicked out. I decided I had to go to the police. There was a murder involved now. I didnt care if they locked me up in some asylum, feeding me pills until my eventual death. I just wanted this to be over with, and the awful person behind this to be caught.

I pulled into the parking lot just outside of the police station when my computer gave the same notification ding from earlier. Screw it. I thought Why not entertain this one last message? I wish I hadnt. I opened up my computer and my heart sank. The picture was from an alleyway, most of the shot was blocked by a rifle equipped with a scope. The rifle was pointing at my car.

A second message appeared.

DO NOT GO IN THERE UNLESS YOU WANT A JANITOR PICKING YOUR SKULL OUT OF THE CARPET.

I froze. I started to look around and noticed an alley across the street. A shadow was casted along the alleyway, so I couldnt see whoever 000000000 was. I clicked my seatbelt back in and then sped off down the street. 

What does this guy want with me? What role does he play in this?

I was just driving around trying to compose my thoughts, when I started getting a stream of notifications on my laptop. I pulled into a Starbucks parking lot, and decided to respond to the messages in there.

I asked him what he wanted. I didnt want to piss him off, so I wanted to make sure that our conversation would be brief and strictly informative. 

He responded with a You know why.

I started thinking back to everyone I had wronged in life. There were a few people I could imagine wanting to give me a solid punch in the gut, but nothing that would cause any reasonable human to go to this extent.

I told him that I really didnt know what was going on. All he told me was that Id be receiving a call over Facebook Messenger explaining everything. I threw what was left of my coffee away, and walked out to my car and awaited the call. It was a call I wont ever forget.

I received an audio call from 000000001 and answered. It was a womans voice who began talking. She didnt say hello, or any pleasantries for that matter. She went immediately into explanation. She told me that I would be emailed a photo of a man and his family, and then proceeded to outline something that made my heart sank.

I was going to have to kill this mans family if I ever wanted to see mine again. He was given a similar task and must kill mine. It was a murderous race.

I asked what would happen if I told her to fuck off, and she said that my family would be dead. She ended the call with the ominous You better find them before hanging up. A sense of dread washed over me. 

I saw a notification bubble form over my email app. I opened it and saw a bald man with his face blurred out, a man who I assume was 00000000. He had a muscular arm around a beautiful asian woman, boasting her toned body in a two-piece bikini. In front of the couple, were two adorable, smiling little girls who looked to be the same age as my own children. Above the image were the words: First his family, then him. Kill him first, and your family dies.

I felt vomit gushing up towards my mouth. I stared at the family. Happy, smiling. I cant kill these people, but what choice do I have?

My state has loose gun laws, so purchasing a .22 hunting rifle was not hard. I couldnt believe I was doing this. I had no choice. It was this mans family, or mine. 

By the time I had finished all my errands it was 11:30PM. I pulled into a rest stop nearby, and fell asleep. 

By the time I awoke, I had received 3 new emails. They were addresses. Above them were the names (Im assuming) of the innocent family that I was about to break apart. Michelle, Isabelle, and Jasmine. I stared at those names for a while. They were such pretty names.

I turned my car on, and started making my way to Michelle. I tried not to think about what I was doing. I couldnt shake the image of that family out of my head. They looked so happy together. Their intertwined shadows were extended across the beach by the setting sun behind them. 

After a torturous 5 minute drive, I arrived at what looked like a 5-star hotel. The rooms on the top floor had balconies for those who wanted to soak in the city scape. Just then, I noticed a sliding door open, and a woman stepped out onto one. It was her. The mother I was about to kill. She sat down onto a fabric-draped chair and began taking selfies with her phone.

I pulled my car into a construction site just across her balcony. It was dark and empty, the construction workers must have the day off. I pulled the hunting rifle out of the trunk of my car and placed her in the crosshairs.

I noticed every feature about her in that scope. Her well-kept eyebrows, her cute smile and perfectly white teeth. I noticed how one corner of her mouth pulls back just a little bit farther from the other when she smiles. 

I noticed how she raises her eyebrows at the sound of a distant gunshot.

I dont know if I can keep doing this. These last 4 days have been the most difficult time in my life. I cant do this anymore.

After my last update, nothing really eventful happened. I went to the gym offered by the hotel, and continued to ponder my current situation until I passed out at about 9:30PM.

I awoke to the sound of the hotel phone ringing on the bedside table. I knew who it was. I knew what I was about to hear, but I still picked up the phone. However, I didnt hear the expected I hope you find them. No, what I heard was much worse, something that I havent been able to stop hearing in my mind for this entire 4-day period. 

I picked up the phone, expecting to hear that tormenting phrase, but I was met with breathing. Heavy breathing. It took me a few seconds to identify whose breathing it was, and when I did I almost dropped the phone. The breathing was from my wife. At first I thought that this must be another recording, but then she said something that confirmed it wasnt.

Please find me 

Her voice cracked and trailed off into sobbing. I was about to ask her where she was when the line went dead. I ripped the phone out of the wall and smashed it against a lamp on the same table, sending it into a collision with the opposite wall, breaking it. I ran out into the parking lot in a fit of both tears and rage. I just sat there and cried. 

She exists, but someone has her. Why else would she be crying? What the fuck are they doing to her? Where the fuck is she? 

I got into my car and drove off. I know it was wrong of me not to pay for the room, but I cant stay there knowing that the woman who is tormenting me knows that Im there. I cant go back home, that place isnt safe either. I decided that I was just going to have to sleep in my car. 

I checked my watch and saw that it was 3:13AM. As per a recommendation on my previous update, I decided to stop by my in-laws house. I couldnt find them through any forms of social media, but now that I knew Christina exists, or at least I think she does, maybe they do too. 

It was about 20 minutes later that I arrived at their house. They lived decently far out on the outskirts of town, so it took a while. I parked my car directly in front of their yard. I left it on, and walked up to their front porch. Their property was small, they were an older couple and didnt need much.

I knocked on the door, and rang the doorbell until someone answered. I know it was early, but I didnt care. I needed to know if they were there. I saw the lights come on in the window seconds before a man opened the door. He was a short scruffy looking-dude who had the body type of a meth addict. The hell do you want? I just replied with nevermind and turned around and walked away, got in my car, and sped off; the man yelling obscenities and swears at me all the while. 

My in-laws definitely dont exist. That much has been confirmed, but where was Christina? How would I be able to find her? Are my kids with her? The thought of some sick fuck having control over them made me furious. 

I drove to an empty parking lot that was for sale, and decided that it would be an alright place to crash. I drifted off to sleep a few minutes after I had parked.

I had nothing but nightmares that night. I was tied down to a chair, watching as my wife was running barefoot through a cornfield, her cheeks wet with tears. She was running from a wall of darkness that was closing in behind her. She then stopped, turned around and looked directly at me. I saw the look of fear in her eyes, she looked like she had given up. I saw her lips begin to move, forming the words Please find me and with that she was gone. The darkness absorbed her.

I awoke with a start. I cant even be safe in my dreams anymore. I checked my watch and saw it was 5:30AM, the rush hour traffic had begun. I didnt know what else to do. I couldnt stay here, but where else would I go. With that my laptop dinged. I looked over into the passenger seat and saw that I had a message from 000000000. I moused over to it, and clicked on it. I knew it was going to be another message meant to torment me. I didnt care anymore. The amount of pain I was feeling already couldnt possibly get any worse.

The messenger app opened and the newly started conversation loaded, if you could call it that. It was a picture. It was incredibly dark, I couldnt see anything but a slight outline of a person. I saved the picture and used a photoshop app to brighten the image.

I wish I didnt. I dont even know how to explain this.

I took the image and brightened it all the way. I recognized who it was immediately. It was the woman who was once in a blue dress. She was lying completely naked in a bathtub, the water red with her blood. Her head lay over the side, her lifeless eyes staring directly at the camera. There were words on the wall above her written it what I presumed was her blood. They read:

IM SORRY PLEASE FIND THEM

I opened the car door and vomited onto the pavement below. My laptop dinged as two more notifications had arrived. I looked and saw that I had received two new messages.

SHE DIDN'T LAST LONG

I'M GONNA FIND YOU YOU SON OF A BITCH

I dont know if I can take much more of this guys. My wife and my two beautiful kids were everything to me, and so far they show no promise of returning. Everyday it gets harder and harder to continue this, and the events that are taking place arent helping. The past two days have added nothing but more confusion, and I want it to stop.

Let me start a little bit after my last post. I decided to go to a local bar and drown my fresh sorrows in some alcohol. Not the best choice of coping, I know, but I just needed to take my mind off things. I stayed at the bar until 9PM (I was only there for a couple hours) before they closed and kicked me out. Too drunk to drive home, I decided to call an Uber. For those who are unfamiliar with Uber, it is a taxi service where everyday people are the cabbies, and they use their personal cars. 

In my smaller town, its usually the same 3 drivers. However, the one who picked me up was new. She was this pretty brown-haired girl, boasting a tight blue-dress. She was chatty, but I honestly didnt feel like talking. She told me it was her first day (which was weird, usually drivers receive training on their first few days of work), asked me how my night was, the typical small-talk questions. However, she told me something I will never forget. Something that still sends chills down my spine.

As she pulled up in front of my house, I exited the car. I started to walk away, when I heard her window roll down. I assumed that maybe the payment didnt come through, or something malfunctioned, so I turned around and faced her. She smiled at me and said I hope you find them! Before I could respond she laughed and sped away. She turned the corner before I could get her license plate number.

What the fuck does she know about this? She has to know something, why else would she say something like that? Was this some sort of sick, elaborate joke? 

I got home and tried to put it out if my mind. Despite it only being 9:15PM, I decided to go to bed. I didnt sleep much. That woman was all I could think about. Who was she? How much did she know? I had no way to be sure. All I know is that this just ruined me. Instead of being sad, now I was just angry. 

I passed out about an hour later. I was startled awake by a call from No Caller ID. Ive always had sleeping problems (now more than ever) so I knew I wouldnt get back to sleep for another few hours. Expecting some night shift salesman, I answered. However, what the female speaker on the phone said was much worse.

I hope you find them.

I was angry, no I was furious. WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?! I screamed into the phone. She hung up, and I threw my phone against the wall, and shattered it.

That was two nights ago.

I awoke the next morning with a sharp headache from the heavy drinking from the night previous. I just sat up in my bed, and stared for a little while. I didnt want to get up. I didnt want to leave my bedroom and find my wife not in the living room with her exfoliative face mask on, pretending to be an alien and chasing Attis and Myla around the room.

After a few minutes of staring and shedding a few tears I got up and went to make myself coffee. I sat down and decided to take my mind off things by watching the news. 

My now old-fashioned landline began ringing in the kitchen. The automated voice began to read off the caller ID Call from: I hope you find them. I got up and bolted into the kitchen. No number was present under the caller ID, even though it usually was. I picked up the phone, my heart sank and tears began to stream down my cheeks. 

There wasnt another human on the line, but an automated message. An automated message of a conversation between me and my wife. It was when my wife told me she was pregnant with Myla (my first child).

I couldnt listen to the whole thing. Hearing my wifes voice just hurt too much. I just sat there on the kitchen floor and shuddered; tears welled in my eyes. 

There were so many questions running through my head. How did they get this recording? What kind of sick person would call me and play this? I assumed it was the female Uber driver from the night before.

I just decided to leave again. I couldnt stay in that house. I couldnt stay in a house I no longer felt safe in. I drove to a nearby hotel, and decided to stay there.

I brought my laptop and conducted some research. I searched through every social media site and online phonebook possible. I even called the university Christina graduated from. No one had records of her existing. Not only that, but her family didnt exist either. I looked up their social media accounts and found nothing.

I spent the rest of the day watching TV and working out at the gym in the hotel, doing anything I could to not concentrate on my situation. I stopped by the local liquor store and bought two twelve-packs of beer to keep me company, and to wash away the damaged emotions I have.

That was last night.

I dont know why this is happening to me. What the hell did I do to deserve this? Why is this mystery girl tormenting me? I dont know what to do. I just want this to end. I just want my family back.

<TEXT> [Click Here To Read Part 2!](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/641qml/my_wife_and_kids_never_existed_part_two/) 

I dont know where to start. Frankly, I dont want to start at all, but I have no one else to turn to besides an anonymous board on Reddit; filled to the brim with people looking to get their next fear fix. Well, this is perfect for you, because Im fucking terrified.

My wife, Christina, and I met around 9 years ago. We had the whole cliche of falling in love almost instantly and getting married only after 2 months of meeting. At least I thought we did, but thats for another time.

About a year into our marriage we decided to have kids. We had a girl, Myla, and then a boy, Attis, one year later. I loved them more than anything else in the world. I would spend every available second I could with them. Hell, sometimes Id even call off work and lie to them saying school was cancelled just to be with them.

At least thats what I remember doing. 

I got up and began my usual routine. I rolled over to find Christinas side of the bed empty, which was weird. She always slept in later than me. I got up and walked into the kitchen and started brewing a cup of coffee. I looked at the clock on the microwave and saw it was 7:55AM. 

"Crap!" I thought. Judging by the fact that the kids werent even up yet, I figured they were going to be late for school. I rushed over to their room to get them up and dressed. I put on my goofy-dad grin and began opening the door. Alright you lazy bums, ti- I stopped, completely shocked at what I discovered. The kids werent in their beds, but that wasnt the weird part. There were no beds. There was nothing in the room that belonged to the kids. 

I dropped my mug, and splattered black coffee all over the wooden floor. Thats right. The WOODEN floor, the kids always had carpet, theyve had it for years. Now all there was was wooden. A pool table sat in the center of the room, the corresponding pool cues in a rack resting on the wall. An old arcade machine (Galaga)  sat in the corner of the room. There were pictures of bands, a few paintings, and a calendar featuring some blonde woman with her legs spread across the roof of a Camaro scattered across the walls.

I was at a loss for words. I didnt know what to do. Then I remembered that I had some family photos (another cliche) hanging up in my living room. I shuffled my way over there and gazed just above the TV, where the pictures were hanging. I only found a huge plasma tv, an Xbox One, and a Star Wars poster occupying the space of printed family memories. 

I was freaking out at this point. Tears began to well up in my eyes. I had to call Christina. I opened my phone, pounded in my passcode and punched in her phone number. My heart sank, the phone number wasn't registered. I desperately clicked onto my contacts to find her. She wasnt there. She wasnt fucking there.

I scrolled through my pictures, videos, even Facebook. All I could find were pictures and videos my college buddies and I at bars and the occasional strip club, nothing of my wife and kids.

I dont know what to do guys. I dont want to tell anyone, theyll think Im crazy. I am freaking out. I KNOW that they exist, Im not a lunatic. I need all the help I can get, and would accept advice from anyone at this point. Please help me. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I Think My Cockatoo is Possesed </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-29 23:54:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Before I start I want to provide some insight to my situation:

A cockatoo is much like a parrot in that it can learn languages. The average cockatoo only learns about 20 to 30 words, however my pet cockatoo, Chance, can memorize what seems like an infinite amount. There will be times where Chance will memorize entire commercials and repeat them back to me. It used to kind of freak me out at first, I mean who wouldnt be a little disgruntled hearing your bird talk to you about animal abuse? But I eventually got used to it. Ill be cooking in the kitchen, or doing chores, and Chance will recite the weather, or some lines from Game of Thrones, and Ill think nothing of it. In fact, Chance has been what youd call a delightful pet. 

Things started to change last night.

When I got home from work, I heard Chance squawking and speaking gibberish as he normally 
does. Except this time, he said a phrase I hadnt heard before.

Mommy Help! Im drowning!

While I am a woman, and certainly like to think of Chance as my feather-baby sometimes, he has never actually called me mommy. I hadnt left the TV on since I got home, but I just chalked it up to Chance combining words, despite how creepy it was.
 
After ordering some Chinese takeout, I flipped on the news. It was the usual stuff. Someone was trying to pass a new bill, an unfortunate terrorist attack happened in the Middle East, but then the newscasters presented something else. Something that still sends shivers down my spine. A 9 year old boy had drowned in a public pool in Louisiana. Chance piped up and said

I told you so. I told you so.

He repeated I told you so probably 4 or 5 times before he finally stopped and began falling asleep. This was weird. This was very weird. 

After a few hours of other things not worth mentioning here, it was finally time for bed. Some people recommend locking your bird up at night, but it makes Chance upset so I leave him out. I dont mind having to clean up the occasional bird dropping, and plus it keeps him quiet. 

I felt my eyelids grow heavy, and was seconds away from falling asleep when I heard Chances wings flap over and his feet land on me. Before I had anytime to question his actions he muttered

Its your fault you know.

What? I groaned, not really in the mood to talk to Chance.

He drowned because of you.

This was beyond weird. I was about to say something else (I dont remember what) when he took off saying

Ill see you in hell! Ill see you in hell!

Thats all he says to me now. Whenever I go up to him and start petting him, Im met with Ill see you in hell instead of the usual happy chirps I receive. I left the TV on all day yesterday in hopes that hed pick up a different phrase, but have had no such luck.

I dont know what to do guys. If any of you have any recommendations, theyd be much appreciated. I will make an update as soon as possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey man, I'm 16 and just started my efforts to no longer masturbate. The best way to do it is to distract yourself from it. Whenever you get the urge or even thought, immediately move into doing something else. Whether it's video games, exercise, playing/listening to music, etc. You can do this man. I believe in you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a 16 year old male and I have recently just started my efforts to no longer masturbate. I am currently on my 5th day of not doing so. I have a constant urge, and while I am very good at practicing self-control, it is becoming increasingly difficult. Long story short, I need help. What are some techniques or strategies I could employ to help get rid of or reduce the temptation? </TEXT>
