<TEXT> We actually _normally_ run multiple LANs a year. However right now we're having issues with location stuff, so that's why our website doesn't have upcoming events to list ( http://lanified.com ).

Once we get location stuff figured out that's appropriate for LANs (the expo was not a LAN btw), we will be running more events.

Honestly though, it is taking longer than I'm comfortable with. Working with locations is extremely frustrating and time consuming. I hate it, but it's necessary, and to you (and others) I'm sorry it's taking so long.

Do you have any questions though about our LANs? I recommend you check out our facebook albums for pictures of our past LANs : https://www.facebook.com/pg/LANified-LANparties-114122358614861/photos/?tab=albums </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just popped my head into the comments for the net neutrality finding to see what people had to say, and I am disgusted to see a pattern.

To find the filing, head to: http://gofccyourself.com , then click on "17-108" on the left of the list to look at the list of comments.

What I am seeing is that bots are spamming the comments with fictitious and potentially illegal comments. How can I tell?

1. The names are sequential, and this pattern is likely to change once someone discovers this. Sequential as in the last name increases alphabetically as you go through the submissions.
2. They say the exact same thing every single time.
3. The posts are one after the other done in batches.
4. This pattern is improbable and inhuman, especially at this scale.

Just take a look:

* Snippet of the list of submissions: http://imgur.com/a/NHzG8
* Content of what each of them say: http://imgur.com/9ZXMSoj

As far as I'm concerned this is usurping the democratic processes within the USA. I am not a lawyer, but I really doubt this is legal. And this most certainly is not serving the people.

Do your part, spread this word, don't let this fall under the rug. Fight for your internet, don't let cheaters prosper. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm on a super hacked Samsung Galaxy S4, running 7.x

16GB internal, added a 64GB SD card, formatted it as local storage.

My understanding was this should "extend" the available storage to the OS. The storage section shows the ~73GB usable space total, and says over 60GB are "free". Yet Google Play keeps saying "not enough space to update".

I'm really not sure what to do about this, the whole point of slamming an SD card in here was to expand the storage. I don't have any need to regularly remove the SD card either, so I'm fine with local storage not being "removable".

What am I doing wrong? Please send help, the walls are closing in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who's native to the area, your experience is very surprising to me. I'm not saying you're wrong, or a liar, just that I have not seen people squelch or treat people as you describe. I'm sorry that you're experiencing it. I would be cautious to say that it is typical for the region as a whole, as there are plenty I know of in the region who are perfectly comfortable with such things. Just like anywhere there are exceptions/bad apples.

Do keep in mind that there are a lot of people and regions in Alberta, so generalising like this is unlikely to be accurate across the whole.

Again, I'm not trying to attack you here, just sharing that I am surprised you're being treated like that, because that's not the Alberta I know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The use case would be for esoteric environments. You mount a zpool, but all sorts of data sets exist for different functions, so you want them to be mounted in different areas. Perhaps different applications expect different things in different locations, but you want it to be ZFS backed, by the same zpool. This could serve that.

Consider this, you could have a dataset for your /home folder, for /var/log, and you could have different parameters set for each dataset, such as compression, snapshotting, etc. This could be very flexible if true! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, the best way for you to find out is to run it in a VM or something ;)

But you get SO much info, for example:

1. Charts based on network usage per interface, cpu usage, ARC hit%, ARC size, and SOOOOO much more
2. You can get arc stats to get even finer details
3. The webGUI is designed whereby you are expected to generally do everything through it, so the functionality takes that into account. As such you can easily instruct things like disk replacement, how the zpool is built, networking configuration, snapshot stuff, etc, etc, etc.

Seriously go try it and allocate a few hours or so to go through it all ;D </TEXT>

I'm trying to use launch parameters to set windowed and norborder stuff. Despite my best efforts it is ignoring any and all launch parameters I set in STEAM, and this appears to be the only game doing this.

Can anyone please advise as to what could be interfering? I suspect a config file, but this seems very asinine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a logical fallacy known as the reduction to the absurd. I'm sticking to reasonable, provable, and scientific basis. Meanwhile you are reducing my position to the absurd by presenting an absurd comparison.

If one cannot conclusively prove that it ACTUALLY causes problems, then it should not be reliable.

Take into consideration, I have seen zero evidence to support that insufficient screws for drives leads to premature failure. Does that mean I'm right? Not necessarily, just that I have contrary experience, without actual tangible evidence.

That's what studies are for. To provide a means whereby you can prove or dis-prove something without a shadow of a doubt. So you (and others) can plan around such things, and know the information is reliable.

Meanwhile, neither my experience, nor the presented information thus far, is conclusively reliable. As such, nobody should plan around any of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's proof that vibration impacts disks.

1. That isn't a study. But it is a valid point.
2. This does not conclusively support the position that "Improper mounting can lead to premature failure.".

This is why there are peer-reviewed studies, so things like this can be conclusively proven or dis-proven. Again, what you have presented is speculation and conjecture. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That depends on the components used. There are industrial systems based on computing that has a lifespan of 20 years, or more. But things built around silly popularism tech like ipods/ipads will have an extremely short lifespan. It's very silly to go with decisions like that just because they're familiar.

I mean, there's tonnes of office automation based around computer tech that's designed to last as long as the building too. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Alcohol vs Marijuana, driving in the (possible) future Canada </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-15 18:42:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been trying to keep abreast of what's going on with the Marijuana law changes, and I recently heard some things that seemed rather... off. In this case, driving under the influence of Alcohol vs driving under the influence of Marijuana.

As of April 13th 2017, the new relevant legislation will have an upper punishment of **10 years in jail** for driving while under the influence of Marijuana.

* http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/liberals-table-marijuana-bill-that-includes-crackdown-on-impaired-drivers/article34696586/

Meanwhile driving while under the influence of Alcohol, has a maximum sentence of **18 months in jail**.

* http://legalbeagle.com/6114545-dui-penalties-canada.html

I tried to find statistics around how _specifically_ marijuana impacts traffic collisions/incidents and such, but I was not able to find such refined statistics as it seems most of the time they are lumped in with other "drugs", and simply labelled "Drug-impaired driving". Thus far it makes it hard to find reliable stats that are _only_ for marijuana.

* http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2016001/article/14679-eng.htm

Meanwhile we have fairly good statistics for drunk (alcohol) driving.

* http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadas-drunk-driving-death-rate-worst-among-wealthy-countries-u-s-study-finds

It also seems that a substantial amount of people believe that driving while under the influence of Marijuana is not "as bad" as while under the influence of Alcohol. Take note the source here is from a group that is _against_ "drugs", which is not an impartial source.

* http://madd.ca/pages/programs/youth-services/statistics-links/

It seems to me that some interesting conclusions can be arrived from this information. Perhaps you can draw your own, but some thoughts of my own:

1. We don't have enough actual (impartial) statistics to prove/disprove the effect Marijuana has on drivers. Yet substantially more information is available for Alcohol.
2. The punishment slated for legislature is not balanced when comparing Marijuana vs Alcohol.
3. How do these new punishments affect people who take Marijuana medicinally? Are they just no longer allowed to drive any more?
4. I think we as Canadians can do a better job than this, namely through getting better facts to guide our plans.
5. Marijuana prohibition is costly in its current form, and new costs can arise from the new legislature in its current form.

Do with this information as you will. I've tried to present this as impartially and fairly as I could. Any parts that could be subjective, I tried to clearly state them. Sorry if I fell short in any ways of such. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Want - stock CPU heatsink - AMD FX 8320, or similar </TITLE>

<TEXT> Looking to pick up one of these : http://ep.yimg.com/ay/outletpc/amd-fd8350frhkbox-fx-8350-125w-am3-eight-core-4-0ghz-desktop-cpu-37.jpg

It is an AMD stock heatsink for CPUs, normally found with FX-8320, 8350, and other similar CPUs. It's meant for CPUs that produce about 130W of thermal dissipation (TDP).

It doesn't need to be new, but it needs to be in good working order. Fan works, etc.

Looking to pay cash, easy sale, if it's the correct part. Post here or PM me if you have one. I need one real soon, so I'm not going to wait around for long. So if you have one, let me know right away. </TEXT>

From what I hear ZFS high-availability is hard to do just within ZFS due to split-brain issues. I'm unsure if this is fully solved. But one way to address this that I've seen is doing the GlusterFS or other clustered FS on top of ZFS, making it so you don't need to HA ZFS itself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're going to operate at that scale, I would use FreeBSD for ZFS (myself prefer FreeNAS) due to the maturity compared to ZoL. With that size, if any bugs were to creep up, you could be in a real world of pain. ZFS on FreeBSD is way more mature than ZoL, so take that into consideration.

Also, you get a lot of tasty conveniences in FreeNAS that are still not exactly readily available in ZoL, like snapshotting, sync, and lots of other GUI stuff. You can do it in ZoL, but it's way more manual.

As for NFS vs iSCSI, I would recommend you use NFS as you will more efficiently manage your available space over larger-scale regards. It takes some explaining.

Otherwise, conceptually, ZFS is designed to be capable of spanning multiple shelves/racks, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmmm, was there the other day and somehow missed this completely. Go me. I'm kinda excited. It seems the people behind Chinook keep making business choices that make sense. Things like the underground parking, the expansion areas. It's too bad the parking lights aren't exactly reliable last I checked, but when they figure that out, it'll be nice.

Chinook is a mall I actually like going to most of the time, not a lot of other malls I can say the same here in Calgary.

<TEXT> The only thing making this not the back is the fact that the PSU power plugs are not on this side. However, this is probably the modern front style from whomever design it. Since power plugs don't get re-seated as much as others do, it seems logical to swap the side they're on, but still have hot-swap PSUs. This design is quite fascinating because it breaks from the norm of having ALL the cables typically on one side.

In this configuration all the cables that are most likely to change, are on this side, which is presented as a convenient "front". The other side, with this design, you probably will NEVER disconnect the power cables themselves. With the way the PSUs are setup, they don't actually have the power plugs on them (so far as I can tell). This probably means then that the plug on the other side, connects directly to this, and then the PSU bridges the circuit to the internal PDU circuitry.

Although, as I continue to think about it, what I notice is I don't see any disks visible here. So this might throw my theory out the window all together! However, this could also be a diskless system. Perhaps it's high-density processing.

Either way, we need to go deeper. </TEXT>

The magnitude of the grounding issues alone to me screams fire or electrocution hazard. Again, if I'm going to be working on it, I would take zero risk in such a situation. I don't want some fire to start elsewhere while I'm fixing shit in another area.

<TEXT> See, I fucking hate it too. It could either be them not knowing how to barter, or them just trying to use shitty tactics, but that doesn't actually matter.

Typically I hate it because it's wasting my time, and the reasoning behind why they say it is irrelevant, because my time is valuable.

So, what I do kind of depends on how valuable the item is, and how much I want to sell it. If it's a more valuable item, and I am more inclined to have it moved, I'll probably say something like "well how about you actually make me an offer?". But if it's something like a $20-$60 item, I'll probably just ignore them because the people asking these questions typically seem to be not worth my time in further "negotiating" anyways. So I just ignore them and go back to working on something actually productive.

Just because they say something, doesn't mean you have to respond. They're trying to get your attention, and if they suck at it, well they just fail at it. You don't have to let losers win. </TEXT>

<TEXT> negotiating in advance of a sale can, but not always, lead to the buyer actually bringing enough money. one of the reasons I prefer to sell in a public space is I can walk away if they waste my time by not bringing enough cash, and they then don't know where I live.

time is money, and if they're wasting my time, I might as well be paying THEM, the more I can do to eliminate them wasting my time, while still making a deal, the more I come out on top. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Remmina is just the client, and it can connect to a variety of protocols including RDP, VNC and I think a few others. By itself, it's not a solution for you, unless you already have the "server" end of it setup.

There's a bunch of ways you can do this, depending on your needs though, and I can't remember them all. If you want to use the RDP protocol there is a way to do it with xRDP (forget the exact name but there's a script to help you get it setup). But the most mature ways are VNC, X11 forwarding, or some variants of this (NX and other variants).

So... there's options, some are Linux-centric, some aren't. Best shop around. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Folks,

Okay so I'm working on an IBM x3620 M3 7376, and I flashed the BIOS to 1.17, except it keeps hanging on the second step of initialising drives and controllers. I want to flash back to 1.06, but the IMM won't let me do that until the "OS has finished loading".

I've swapped into the backup BIOS, and that's on 1.06, but I'm not seeing a way to flash the other BIOS in this state. I checked a manual for the system, but can't quite find a way to flash the 1.17 BIOS back to 1.06.

Anyone with keen ideas? Please share? Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, sorry about the project x thing. We've had a lot of problems with them, and many people have confused them for us and it's become really tiring. I didn't mean to lash out at you like that. While your perspective on that event was that it was good, there have been many other problems their lack of quality has caused us, and I'm pretty fed up with them. So, again, I'm sorry, it's just caused me more grief than I'm okay with over the years.

Second, the reasoning behind this format is certainly a lot more than just what you've even more briefly outlined here. I just don't want to justify our decisions, at length, to every single person that inquires about them. That isn't really a productive task. Honestly, the ORIGINAL reason we (I) developed the format, way back when, was so that we could have more teams participating at a LAN that had capacity of 40 people. We were running 6's to start, and we saw that didn't result in a very good tournament or experience, due to the low number of teams that even _could_ participate. As such, I developed the 3v3 format initially to address that. Since then, we have refined it a lot of times, and found even more reasons to run with it.

Third, I hope you make it. That'd be cool, because the format is really fun. While you may have your concerns about it's viability in other areas, consider putting them aside and come have some fun? ;)

If you make it, I hope you have a blast. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is our name Project X? No. We are LANified!, please read the actual branding used on the youtube page and video. I don't know why people keep thinking we are Project X, because we never have been.

In regards to the format, we actually have "dethrone" mechanisms in place to address rolling elements in the stage 1 facet. Should a team come in and then also steam roll the finals, then so what? At that point it's just like any other tournament. Competitive gaming sees similar elements in other games too, such as Seagull in Overtwatch, and countless examples of SKoreans coming to NA scenes for other games and wrecking face.

If you don't think it's fun, or sound, that's fine. That's just like... your opinion man. But we have used the format for the last two years at the Expo, in addition to the many years at LANs before that, and the proof's in the pudding. We have more people signing up for it at the expo than we can handle, and everyone says it's a blast. If it's working after 2 years, I'm confident when I say it's sound.

So... how about we all relax and consider that it _might_ actually be fun, hey? </TEXT>

Firstly, the scope of it being implemented at the expo is due to limited commitment. The TF2 stuff will not have any advance registration for the tournament, as people at the expo will register day-of. This makes a team size of 3 much more feasible to actually be formed.

Secondly, we've already refined the format over the years of using it at our LANs on and off, so we know it works.

Thirdly, we've used it the last two years before this at the expo, so we know there is more demand than we can serve for it.

Fourthly, it's fun.

There's other reasons, but these are strong ones, and we see this format as serving the needs of the expo the best.

I cited eXtine here not just because of his reputation within the community, but because he is also familiar with the format. With people repeatedly blindly shutting down this format, it's helpful to be able to refer to someone respected in the community that actually has knowledge of this format. As such, he is a reputable second opinion on this topic. </TEXT>

You can thank CS:GO cheaters.

Also, open your mind friend, the format is actually very mature : https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/620kyn/tf2_details_at_calgary_expo_2017/dfj9qhq/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because we've been using the format for years, and it works incredibly well at the Calgary Expo event and elsewhere. We had more people signing up than we could actually process in 2015 and 2016, and that's just at the Expo itself. It's actually really fun, if you want a third party opinion on it, I recommend asking eXtine.

The format is not blindly used/developed, it's actually been developed over years of refinement, and those developing it actually have won multiple TF2 tournaments.

You should try it out! </TEXT>

Nobody is going to pay that close to retail for a 4mo second-hand card, they would be better off to pay the difference for a brand new card and be sure they can get warranty and returns, etc.

Sorry m8, you really need to drop the price to move it. </TEXT>

2. Ya flashing the firmware on a card is an option, but gotta see if the card is on the HCL for FreeBSD too. MODELS PLSSSS.
3. Going with "older" gen procs means you can stick to DDR3, which is plenty fast, and very affordable now adays. ECC is more expensive, but like ~$10 more per DIMM, and if you're getting a server mobo you really need to be getting ECC anyways. Plus you can add more later ;o

<TEXT> 1. That's fucking bonkers that a server motherboard has white/blacklisting of hardware. I'd fucking return that bitch of a mobo if that ever happened to me! I'm sure many other sysadmins would say that kind of behaviour of a motherboard is completely unacceptable. So, rest assured other mobos (like from Supermicro, or others) should NOT do that kind of crap.
2. Which HBA(s) were you looking at? It's important to get ones that are known to work with FreeBSD/FreeNAS (based on FreeBSD).
3. What's the max RAM total that you anticipate needing? Server CPUs should give you plenty of cores for such things, but is anything actually requiring high clock speed at all? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay so my thoughts in response:

1. What are you talking about intel blacklisting RAID cards? I've never heard of this. Can you give me specifics?
2. With ZFS you don't need or even WANT RAID cards, you want (an) SAS HBA(s). ZFS you will want the disks directly presented to the OS, as there is a lot of functionality in ZFS that literally requires this to operate correctly. This can reduce your cost also, as HBAs are cheaper than HW RAID controllers. Furthermore, ZFS storage pools (zpools) are usable in other systems/OS' if they have OpenZFS support. For example, you can make a ZFS pool in FreeNAS, and if you need to, bring it to Linux if you have the same version of OpenZFS installed and it is expected to work.
3. When I looked at OMV, the feature list didn't even list ZFS, yet a wiki page about it said it does support ZFS. This kind of inconsistency makes me unsettled about the real quality behind OMV. Comparatively FreeNAS has an entire company developing it, ix Systems. From what I see it's night and day between the two.
4. I really am not seeing a good reason here for you to go with Ryzen in this case. If you absolutely must go AMD, there are opteron or other CPUs you can use that would be plenty. Also keep in mind most VMs are more RAM hungry than CPU (not always the case of course).
5. Is any of what I'm saying not working for your goals?
6. You're welcome, sharing is caring! Oh, and if you ever know anyone that needs professional support for things like this, do send them my way ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm, well I have a few thoughts here.

1. Considering the VMs are to be spun up for labbing purposes, why do you need Ryzen? ZFS is very not demanding of CPU resources. As such I think you could achieve your goals without having to go bleeding edge. Furthermore it means you can act sooner rather than later.
2. I haven't exactly fully gone through OMV, but from what I'm seeing on its site, I would say it isn't as mature or robust as FreeNAS. OMV looks quite robust, but at _first glance_ I would recommend FreeNAS before OMV. I understand the CPU arch concern, valid one, but as I mentioned in #1, I think you can achieve your goals with earlier tech making it a moot point.
3. If you do go with FreeNAS, the latest release that just dropped, 10 aka Corral, would serve you very well in many regards, including your VM/docker needs.

Let me know your thoughts, as I think you might be headed in a less than ideal direction here ;) </TEXT>

What kind of stability concerns are you particularly concerned about lately?

* FreeNAS 9.3 is based on FreeBSD 9.3
* FreeNAS 9.10 is based on FreeBSD 10.3
* FreeNAS "10"/"Corral" is based on FreeBSD 11.x (unsure on exact version this very second)

I can't speak about FreeNAS before 9.x as I only tried it a bit before that, and I didn't notice any stability issues there either. But most of my time with it has been with 9.3. I'm pretty demanding on it too, VMs, and all kinds of other data on it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would say start with 16GB honestly, if it's for home or SOHO 16GB will probably give you plenty. Another thing to consider is that if your ARC hits your max usable RAM, things don't explode. It just means your hit% might go down and the data might come from disk more frequently than from RAM.

The way the data that's in ARC is managed is extremely dynamic and a lot of elements are taken into consideration, so the ARC size and hit% can change over time depending on workloads. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing is the amount of RAM you need can't reliably be determined by a mathematical equation or method, because it depends on your workload and other factors too. The reliable way to determine if you have enough RAM for ARC is if your hit% is at or above 80% and the ARC size is less than your max RAM.

For example, a FreeNAS environment I support has 16GB of max RAM, but only uses about 11GB regularly. The hit% is very high, and as such ZFS has no real need to have more RAM or increase the ARC size.

This will change between workloads and scenarios, so that's also why the 1TB/GB thing is also completely bunk now adays. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not 100% sure in this case. ZFS send/receive would be the fastest indeed. If you have another box that you can ZFS send to, set compression on that one, send to it, see if it actually does compress it (send _some_ data). That should be fairly conclusive. That scenario I just can't conclusively say whether compression would happen just yet. I bet it would though, it would be silly if it didn't! </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's your problem, never run without compression. Seriously, I have never seen a good reason to turn compression **OFF**. It costs almost zero CPU usage and increases performance on reads and writes. It helps both of them because it reduces the number of blocks that it takes to read or write data. You're not gonna DIE if you run without compression, but seriously, you're shooting yourself in the foot if you do. Turn it at least to lz4, but if you have a good CPU try a higher GZIP compression option.

This is probably the biggest contributor to your less than stellar performance. Of course, this change will only impact data after it's written. So you may want to move data off and back on to trigger compressions.

You can also get per-dataset compression ratios too, so you can see how effective this is for said data.

Do it up! ;o

**edit:** I bolded the part I said wrong. I meant to say I have not seen a reason good reason to turn compression off, when I accidentally said on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The 4k thing is something you want to do BEFORE you setup the zpool, you can't properly change it later. What you're doing is configuring it to match the drive spec.

Drives currently come in three options:
* 512byte
* 4k/512byte emulated
* 4k

If the drive can do 4k, 4k is what you want.

Hit %/ARC size is something you can't find out till you're actually using it though, but it's some sweet stats you get from other storage systems. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're making a vdev for a zpool with a single device, that's fine, as long as you know there is no redundancy protection against drive failure. Which it sure seems like you're aware of.

I would say this is a good idea for the time being, as ZFS will let you do all kinds of super duper neato shit like snapshots, and as you clearly need, protection against corruption/bit rot. This functionality is expected to work just fine with one disk in your zpool.

A few things to consider:

1. Make sure you set the 4k alignment to match the spec of your drive. This is a small thing, but when it comes to rtorrent it'll probably help your performance.
2. 16GB of RAM will be enough, and if it isn't you can add more later ;) But the way you can be sure is as you use it comparing your hit % to your ARC size. 80% hit rate or higher is just fine, and near that percentage is fine too. If your ARC size is say... 12-13GB+ and your hit is say 60% or lower, you need more RAM.
3. You're probably going to be just fine. </TEXT>

Normal Chromecasts don't have any form of mic, but I am not 100% on the built-in ones. AFAIK there's no functionality with Chromecasts for mic/cam shit though, so I _doubt_ they have mics, but I have not had the chance to check just yet.

Also, this is why I prefer to have physical switched mics ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well for starters, I've actually won tournaments. But I also run gaming events and tournaments too (for almost 10 years now), and competitive viability is a very important element when we decide what games are going to be ran. OW has no LAN servers, hit detection problems, and plenty more where they came from. Alternatively there are games like CS:GO, DotA 2, Rocket League and plenty others that are far better suited to competitive play than OW. Hell, I'd run TF2 before OW.

Think about it another way too, OW is repeating the mistakes TF2 did like 7 years ago. There's plenty of map choke points that lead to boring play or stalemates, just for a quick example. Blizzard is just trying to copycat TF2 without actually taking any of the lessons that community has learned and applying them.

Just not even worth it, OW is unfit.

Not only that, it doesn't matter if your opinion or mine is better than the next, I can objectively reason why OW is bottom of the list when it comes to picking what games to run events/tournaments for. </TEXT>

Well, power usage doesn't necessarily consume fossil fuels neither. There are plenty served from hydro for example alone.

<TEXT> Okay if we're coming at this from a wasteful perspective, I would argue that depends how you get energy. If it's from solar, or your own other form of renewable, is it really wasteful at that point?

Also, I would say it depends on how often you interact with your rasp pi. If it's regularly, then there's a "time waste" in having to deal with manually turning it on, before you can even start using it, which I would say is more wasteful than just leaving it generally on.

Furthermore, what about leaving your phone plugged in while the battery is full? That's a similar amount of waste, but I'm confident that's not generally considered wasteful. </TEXT>

Depending on what your price is per kwh, you're probably going to be charged in the realm of $0.05-$0.13 per month if it runs literally 24/7 and is the 1.2W model (there are plenty of models that use less power).

Leaving a rasp pi running is not wasteful whatsoever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't been DT recently, but it's worth noting they're working on rolling out LTE to Calgary _this_ year. LTE can penetrate areas much better than 3G/HSPA+. It can't get here fast enough, but I'm also glad they're doing it right. With Shaw behind them, I have even more confidence.

But yeah, the times I've been DT in the last few years, there have been areas I've had really weird coverage. It's frustrating, and I really hope LTE solves such things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Um, so since you seem to be giving this away at no cost to the viewer, would you be willing to share it with other mediums? Such as say, sharing the file via a torrent that you host?

I watched the 11min bit, and I'm going to watch the full length later (probably today). And I think if you're already getting it out there like you are, maybe other mediums can increase the visibility further.

<TEXT> Firstly, there are people who report issues with UFS causing serious data failure during weird shutdowns.

Secondly, ZFS has awesome data integrity functions to it.

Thirdly, you can get some awesome performance out of it (but this isn't so much relevant to pfSense).

Fourthly, you can do snapshotting, and lots of other awesome advanced functions that really aren't available with other storage tech.

Compared to UFS or HW RAID, ZFS is the cat's meow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While this may become reality, I'm going to need far more substantive proof than this. This is hearsay and speculation.

But, reader, put down your pitchfork, I am not advocating FOR windows. I am advocating FOR reasonable discourse. Information like this impacts me because I provide IT support to Windows and hybrid environments, so I need to keep abreast of such things. That being said, this is not even close to reliable information and I wouldn't even consider presenting this to a client, partner or industry peer. It is speculation without any credible sources of the actual outcome.

I use Linux for my workstation, and all over the place. But I also have a Win10 tablet that I use to test compatibility things. Should this "cloud" version become a reality, it would be a pretty big issue for me. However, I again I call into light the integrity of the sources here.

* **tl;dr:** This could happen, but I need real proof, and this is not real proof. If it happens, it's a big deal. </TEXT>

1. isn't going to fly with nVidia unless you have workstation/higher class GPUs. The drivers will (and already do) lock you out of such stuff if you're using GeForce. There are some ways to get around this, but they aren't exactly compatible with what is being said here.
2. well this is vendor specific, what about AMD or other procs? Considering Linux is written for MANY other processors, this seems pretty meh.

<TEXT>  In Esports the frequency of roster swaps and player turnover is much higher than in traditional sports

While this is correct, perhaps VP winning the latest CSGO tourney is likely to turn that methodology for some teams around. They haven't changed roster in... over 4 years? And the story goes "we're not changing roster until a funeral". As macabre as that is, it demonstrates that there is still so much more uncertainty as to what is and what isn't successful in so many different aspects of eSports. There are plenty of examples supporting your position, and I think there will be more examples going forward supporting mine. All because we still are figuring out.. "what the fuck IS eSports, and how does it work?".

It's so wildwest, and that's part of the thrill I get out of it. I run events and such, and I'm excited for the future. But one thing I know, I need to make shit happen or I'm going to become irrelevant.

Neat points though. I generally agree with almost all of what you have to say :)

 Owners and players however need to be careful to the deals they are making.

That one I especially agree with! </TEXT>

2. Proxmox in a cluster every node can manage every other node in the cluster.
3. Proxmox you don't need a VM to manage the cluster, it's built-in and the webgui is awesome.
4. Proxmox is very efficient and fast.

Frankly I'm going to recommend Proxmox 10/10 times unless there's a feature you need in ESXi that isn't in proxmox (but this doesn't happen often). </TEXT>

<TEXT> USB 3.0 is 5gbit which is generally the same speed SSDs can max out at, ~600MB/s

Compare that to most USB 3.0 flash sticks that do about 110MB/s maybe upwards of 200MB/s and it's a very big difference.

When it comes to installing an OS, this can speed things up massively, and when dealing with such tasks at scale, that translates directly into money saved. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes but here's a secret... you can dust it out. Not only that, you can monitor the temperature of your components and have email alerts so you know when to dust it out! My servers recently alerted me of such.

I'm not the one that talked about solder "breaking down", collinsl02 did.

As for the cyclic heating, that's a possibility, but I've seen no tangible evidence of this actually happening to CPUs. Since they are the typically the highest heat generating part in a computer, the other parts in such a regard are irrelevant. When I say no evidence, I mean I've seen no studies or reports about it, and I've not seen it happen in servers that have been running for decades. There are literally servers that have been running for upwards of 30+ years, so if this were ACTUALLY a thing, it would have happened by now and been readily visible. But it doesn't, and it isn't.

Not dusting out a computer, well that's just stupid and of course will lead to failure, but that's regular maintenance and very easy to do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dust! Oh no! What ever shall we do! The parts that actually heat up enough aren't even close to solder, and even still the melting point of solder lead is 188oc which CPUs either shut down before they reach that, or thermal-throttle themselves, which starts about 100oc.

Face it dude, you're wrong. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's just a perception from various things around us being faster, but the hardware isn't actually any slower at all. In fact if you properly re-purpose hardware they can still be very competitive with modern hardware! depending on the workload of course. BIOS' init faster, HDDs run faster, but silicon doesn't actually slow down. If you're running lots of lightweight tasks, like email servers, websites, or other things, such hardware can last way longer than most realise.

I still have harder that still works after well over 10 years of use! Just need to build appropriately. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Folks,

BTN is ratioless, and clearly very successful. So when we see new trackers like RED/PTH, etc, turn up with ratios, it kind of blows my mind that we're still using an antiquated method like that.

Ratios generally require a zero-sum reality, and life just isn't like that. Not only that ratio trackers make the users feel less interested in trying new things because of the "cost" of such things, and then they need to do a return-on-investment consideration. "If I download this, will I ever get ratio back for it?". Chances are, if it's a low popularity item, you will never get ratio back for it.

This all seems very counter-productive to the whole sharing culture we've built for ourselves here.

I think ratioless is the way to go. What do you guys think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> If that person on that computer searched for a topic along the lines of how to throw, the websites that come up, and the google searches, could use several different mechanisms to identify that computer and browser.

1. A cookie/cookies could be delivered to the computer as a fingerprint.
2. The session of the browser/ip/resolution/other identifiers can be uniquely generated to identify. The extent this method can go is very deep.

Next, once identification has been assessed, this can cross multiple sites if the same advertising agents that generate the identifying marks, are the same ones presenting the ads on other sites. So when they go to youtube (OH SHIT GOOGLE OWNS THAT TOO), it's possible for the ads to pick up on the above identifiers and deliver ads relevant to their past behavior. In this case, related to the search for "throwing".

This is used all over the internet and has been for years now, it's a modern technique to try to improve the quality of ads people see so they are more likely to interact with them. This is just a comical side effect.

Also, these mechanisms are a particular concern for people who care about their privacy. Long-term data can be collected in such ways to develop profiles of people and sometimes this can become invasive and overreaching. Hence why browsers have things like "incognito" mode, which helps quite a bit, but not completely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're talking about having one VM technically operate across more than 1 bare-metal computer at the same time, you're talking more along the lines of an application/beowulf cluster. This is technically possible, but most hypervisors don't do this. While I can't direct you in how to do this, I know it has been achievable for over a decade. I'm not sure what software does it, but you're probably in for some very complicated elements.

Perhaps consider, is there anything you want to do that actually would benefit from such a structure? If yes, then look into it. If no, then consider it might not be worth the effort. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Folks,

We're looking to get some help with developing our website, and possibly future tools for our events.

To be clear, this is a volunteer position. We understand this isn't for everyone, and that's fine. But if you're interested in contributing, working with us can grant some great experience, and help develop the future of gaming in our part of the world.

You wouldn't be alone, we already have staff contributing to such work, but we are working to increase the number of contributors so that we can roll out awesome stuff faster, without overloading people.

Are you possibly interested? We're looking for 1 to 2 individuals who are familiar with the LAMP stack. Linux, Apache/Nginx, MySQL, PHP. Also, we're hoping to get help with both the front-end and back-end development.

If you're interested, don't be intimidated, apply today! If you have a resume, send that to us. If not, just tell us what experience you do have, what things you've worked on/with, and just do your best to "sell" yourself on how you can help us. Competitive experience is nice too, so if you have any of that, do let us know! (even if it's not-gaming related). Also, if you have any programming experience, whatever the language, please include that too. Again, there's plenty of room for learning here, and we recognise that there are transferable skills too!

To apply, please email bloodyiron _at lanified dot_ com </TEXT>

<TITLE> Using POL to install battle.net, then for WoW: Legion, 64-bit </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-17 05:15:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Folks,

I'm trying to get World of Warcraft: Legion to work in a 64-bit version of WINE, and so far it's working rather well. Considering there are people who get tripped up getting battle.net setup, I figured I would share what I had to do to get battle.net alone going in such an environment. This is using the Play On Linux tool version 4.2.10

1. Install Wine 2.0-rc6-staging 64-bit (2.0-staging and/or 2.1-staging probably works fine too, but the one I know works is 2.0-rc6-staging)
2. Turn CSMT on
3. In the libraries section of the WINE configuration, set the following values (copy exactly between the quotes, including asterisks):

* "*winhttp" native/builtin
* "*wininet" native/builtin
* "api-ms-win-crt-conio-l1-1-0" native
* "api-ms-win-crt-heap-l1-1-0" native
* "api-ms-win-crt-locale-l1-1-0" native
* "api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0" native/builtin
* "api-ms-win-crt-stdio-l1-1-0" native/builtin
* "d3d11" disabled
* "msvcp140" native/builtin
* "ucrtbase" native
* "vcruntime140" native/builtin
4. Add the following components:
* Microsoft Core Fonts
* vcrun2010
* vcrun2012
* d3dx9
* winhttp

5. Install winetricks in your parent Linux install (as in, not within POL), and use it to install vcrun2015. You will need to point winetricks to the prefix that POL created for this. To find the exact commands, check out : https://www.playonlinux.com/en/issue-5291.html . This will also install a bunch of other stuff along with it, which I didn't find to be a problem.
6. INSTALL Battle.net and run.

I had to re-install it for some reason at some point (crashed over night), however I didn't have to modify this prefix otherwise. Battle.net is launching for me, I installed WoW:Legion successfully with it, and I was able to launch WoW:Legion through the client too.

**IMPORTANT, DISABLE SOUND NOTIFICATIONS FOR FRIEND MESSAGES WITHIN THE CLIENT. IF YOU DON'T BATTLE.NET WILL CRASH WHEN YOU RECEIVE A MESSAGE FROM A FRIEND EACH TIME**

Hope this helps! :D

Specs:

* Ubuntu 16.10 64-bit
* Intel i7-980x
* nVidia GTX 960, driver 367.57
* 3x monitors
* Ur mom lololol

Then I should get my ass in gear and make more maps. I've gone from 11 stars to 32, and with any luck maybe I can hit 50 and unlock 10 more sweet upload slots and really do some cool stuff! Thanks for all this dude, and hope we can keep this going :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> The maps like Woosh are very very early maps for me, there's maps that I've made that I've removed that were made after that! So some of the techniques I've stopped doing (baddies in blocks).

I want to make larger levels, but the lack of people playing my maps was like a big boulder dragging me down. After you and some others playing my maps, giving feedback, I think I'm invigorated to make more! Longer! Better! :D

I'm thoroughly enjoying your maps too! I think, in my opinion, they are too long for 100xMario challenge. If I saw them in the 100x I would skip them, as they would take me too many lives to complete. Not because they are beyond me, but because of silly mistakes. I don't have Super Expert unlocked just yet, but with that mode you have 100x lives, but less levels, so you can put more effort in per level! I think it would help if Expert were more like this, instead of identical to Normal, but higher difficulty.

Either way, I'm playing through more of your levels, I'll favourite you, and hope you check out my future maps too! :D </TEXT>

Pretty sure I am setup correctly, gonna jump through your maps  now :)

Okay, so the first level I played of yours "airship of backtracking". Really neat premise, but I got stuck and couldn't figure out how to get to the first flag. The autoscroll compounds the difficulty for me too as it feels pretty panicky. I think I got close a few times, but I'm stopping that one as it's just frustrating me, did quite a bunch of tries, even explored other areas. Moving onto another map of yours now :D

Sure looks like my maps are a lot more simplistic than yours D: sorry in-advance.

oh, my, god, I just realized I've been playing /u/oledakaajel 's levels this whole time and thinking they were yours! I'm going to fix this, play yours and give feedback :D </TEXT>

I think I'm going to avoid the twitch idea though as I think it might get me more attention than my maps reasonably warrant. While I think it's a helpful idea, I want my maps to be successful primarily because of their quality/merits, not just because a magnifying lens suddenly is pointed at it (so to say).

Thanks for the help tho! :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the last few months, I think I've had 2 or 3 deleted, and those levels were up for over a month. Them being deleted seemed pretty reasonable as they weren't taking off at all.

I know the deck is stacked against me, but I've also seen other people who are low scale, posting new maps, doing better than me (getting more plays/stars). So, there must be a way I can improve this.

I suppose sharing might be required to overcome this, but I'm really hoping to make progress based on the quality of my maps! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like this proposal, and I'm willing to reciprocate. How about this though. I'm not sure how to "bridge the gap" between my Wii U profile and the "greater internet" profile. I know that there's a page on the internet with my Mario levels, but I'm not sure how to find it. Can you point me the relevant nintendo page so I can get my profile page for you?

When you say Bookmark profile, do I need to bookmark all my maps for you to see them? Or will my profile just show all the maps I have currently uploaded to people who view my profile?

As for reciprocation, how about this. I would love you to play all my levels, but I also would love to hear all your feedback. If you want to give any stars, please do so if you think they warrant it, I don't want to earn any stars if they aren't deserved. I'd love to hear your feedback so I can use it for better map making too! Pour it on me, even the small things!

Since you say you have only 12 uploaded, we're kind of on the same scope here. So, in return, link me to your profile, I'll figure out how to play them (if I get stuck I might need some help). Then I'll give you as much feedback as I can on each one, and star where I feel appropriate. Is there going to be a way for me also to view your profile on my Wii U? So far I've only found the ability to search for single map codes, not user profiles. How would I do that?

I want to make awesome maps, and I think giving back to those who help me seems very fair too! :D Thanks for your offer, let's make it happen? :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm, I'll look into that! Feedback is definitely something I'd find valuable, in addition to plays. I'm doing SMM primarily because I want to make awesome maps that people enjoy, with my own twist. I try to consider more and more as I do it, even small things that irritate people. For example, it seems like a lot of people don't like hammer bros, so I try to only use them in certain ways that aren't "punishing".

But yeah, daily level exchange, sounds like a solid idea! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I don't really know how the system works for presenting maps to players. I've seen lots of new and old maps, even unpopular ones, presented to me in 100 Mario Challenge, hence why I'm also confused.

What I've been doing is letting some maps sit and collect plays, but also reviewing the ones that aren't successful, removing them, either re-doing or adjusting them, and re-uploading. I don't re-upload a modified version of every one I've made, as I also work on new designs too. So, I think I'm making progress from a quality perspective, but I still feel a bit stuck.

As for posting for people here to play, I'm not against that, but I have been trying to have my maps become successful on their own merit. Since I'm now trying to reach out for help, maybe sharing is going to help a lot. I don't think sharing on here is cheating, but I also want to be rewarded fair and square for my hard work. Make sense? :)

So, it sounds like maybe I'm on the right track, but some points you make could help too. Yes? :) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Folks,

Okay, before posting this, I read the rules as best as I could (sideboard is what I saw, I didn't see a rules page). Also tried a bit to see if there were any sort of FAQ stickies or something, but I didn't really find much, so I'm sorry if I'm talking about stuff that many others commonly ask/talk about too.

I got Super Mario Maker for the Wii U a few months ago, well after the massive hype it had.

I've been making and uploading levels periodically, each time analysing how people play the level. I try to identify what works, what doesn't and continually try to do a better job. I've been getting a bit more plays and a bit more stars than before, but not much.

I'm sitting on 11 stars, and reaching the 50 star first target seems very painful to me, since my my most popular level has 28 unique players and 2 stars. Yet at times it seems SMM just stops presenting my maps to players.

I'm trying to progress in the SMM world legitimately, not by gaming the system. But I'm having a hard time figuring out how to improve the number of people playing my levels naturally.

I can link to my maps if you guys really want to see them, but I'd love to hear some advice as to what can make a real difference in getting the maps to be more played.

I try to make maps that are fun, have interesting puzzles to them, and aren't super punishing hard. Right now aiming for more "Normal"/"Hard" (not quite Expert) difficulty. I'm not making maps that just award free wins to the players, hell I even put a fair bit of effort into hidden secrets too!

So, can you guys help me out here? What more could I be doing?

Thanks :D

edit: if you want to check my levels out, here's my profile : https://supermariomakerbookmark.nintendo.net/profile/bl00dyiron?type=posted if you want to star/comment, that'd be appreciated, but only if they deserve it! :D </TEXT>

3. When it comes to laptops and phones, standards of similar nature to ATX just won't fly. The industry changes way too much, and you need to remember there are so many details defining ATX, that they would prevent innovation in the laptop and phone sector.

If you take a look at the internals of a P4 laptop vs an early i5 laptop, vs even newer ones, it's very clear that motherboard designs alone drastically change between generations, manufacturers, and scopes of products. There are manufacturers that have taken it upon themselves to at least have their own unification of certain parts (Lenovo/IBM, Dell, etc). But standards like ATX speak about internal dimensions to such a specific degree, such things just would prevent laptops from being able to be an innovative sector. We wouldn't see motherboards shrink in size like we have seen, and batteries grow in-turn.

Phones, yes there are some directions that seem rather silly, like how thin they are. But if you reflect upon how phones have changed over the years internally, again you will find that if constraints were put in-place similar to the ATX standard, it would drastically limit innovation in the sector.

That being said, I think if there is going to be a standard for laptops similar to ATX, and/or a standard for phones in similar vein, we are probably the closest we could be to actually being able to intelligently design such a thing.

Technology has moved so fast, and not everything works everywhere as a result. ATX has achieved a tonne, but even now we see it's not enough. There's mATX, mini-ITX, EATX, and more. Hell, even though I've been working in the industry for so long, there's form factor's even now that I'm learning about! (notably in embedded systems). </TEXT>

<TEXT> People ship BILLIONS of dollars worth of goods all the time. Trusting a company to move something valuable to you because you don't have the resources is plenty reasonable, and is done by thousands of businesses and individuals every day. Them trusting another company to provide an important service isn't them not taking responsibility for their stuff, it's not about that.

A several thousand dollar computer, or rocket parts, or whatever the fuck it is, all of them have plenty of perfectly acceptable reason to be shipped by a company that's business model is safely moving things around. So, if you still can't see that as reasonable, then you are seriously detached from the rest of society.

<TEXT> Computers, as in, the majority of the industry as we know it, became popular because of the ATX formfactor. This industry standard (and it is an ACTUAL standard, documented by Engineers and such), enabled people to repair computers, manufacturers to make parts that are interchangeable, OEMs to sell entire computers from parts made by others, and so much more. Computers were pretty strong before ATX, but the ATX standard was _SO GOOD_, it caused the industry to EXPLODE into the scale we see today.

This is why you can put ANY ATX motherboard in ANY ATX case, use ANY ATX PSU, and it is EXPECTED to work (assuming the parts actually are functional of course).

This has not been a feasible task to apply to Laptop design or phones, so you can't really compare the two.

However, I do agree that right to repair legislature is really required here with the direction phones have been going (Apple is just the best example of this fuckery). </TEXT>

You will probably never notice the difference in your workflow between a good SATA SSD and an NVMe device. Yes, it is faster, but you WILL NOT notice.

Plus, CPUs are a right pig to upgrade after the fact for laptops, and many laptops don't even let you do that. The NVMe upgrade probably can be done later if you somehow actually need it.

<TEXT> No it's not. You can see plenty of benefits in dropping thermal temps without having to overclock. For starters, your CPU is likely to last longer. Then you're also wasting less power because the CPU is probably spending less power to operate. Also, you're spewing less heat into your work/living space, reducing how much cooling you need to do (stuff like this is important in areas like Nevada). And, your HSF is going to have to work less to be able to cool your CPU, which means you can drastically reduce the noise level of your HSF.

Again, dropping temps, does not, whatsoever, imply that overclocking is going to happen. That's like saying anyone who dusts out their HSF to drop temps must be doing it to overclock their CPU/compie. It's silly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sure such people would one day appreciate being able to at least somewhat publicly talk about how they have turned their life around and are trying to contribute back to society, despite past mistakes. I mean, I understand what you mean, privacy is important, but the whole point of punishment for "crimes" and such is meant to be rehabilitation. Once they have served their time, we need to welcome them back into society and not make them feel like second class citizens.

Put yourself in their shoes.

Oh, and no, I do not have a criminal record, but I do have a heart. ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  formal IT education

Yeah, the majority of post-sec teachings are out dated by the time you graduate. The best way to learn is to home-lab. Identify what areas you want to do, from a goal perspective (for example, I want to setup a way to have central account management, so I learn Active Directory), and then break down how exactly you get there. Then in your lab, where it's nice and safe if you break shit, you try to set such things up, and if you fail, you do it again, and again.

I have lost count of the number of students coming out of post-sec, hell even with a CS degree, that have no idea how to actually work with corporate/biz/org IT. It's not that they're stupid, or bad people, it's that the lessons aren't actually relevant to how IT works in the real world.

I totally get the money is hard to come by thing man, and you don't have to spend a lot to get a home lab. But let me tell you, best investment of my LIFE. If you want some specifics for what you could to do setup a home lab, let me know, and we can talk more about it. :) </TEXT>

I have several subdomains issued by StartSSL. Chrome and Firefox both report some of them "NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID", and other domains setup identically work just fine.

Then when I use tools like:

* https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze
* https://www.htbridge.com/ssl

They report the certs and chain to be 100% a-ok.

I don't get the errors in Chromium.

I reached out to StartSSL, but I suspect I won't hear from them till tomorrow. So, just a fore-warning, something weird might be going on. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-01-31 00:25:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Folks,

Look, I know it's a pain point to talk about, but I want to share my thoughts here because I think they're important.

I use Linux for gaming, work and plenty of other things. I have switched away from Windows (over a year ago now) and I have no plans to go back. I play so many games already on Linux, and that number is increasing. There are games I can't play on Linux (HMMM I WONDER WHERE THIS IS GOING?), but more and more of those games are becoming playable on Linux (DOOM is a recent example), be it native or with WINE.

Now, there are a lot of reasons I have moved to Linux. If you really want to know, I can tell you more about it. Some of them are things I can't stand about Windows, some of them are things I love about Linux. I'm a sys admin, and I've been working with Windows since 3.11, and I've been working with Linux for over 15 years now, so I know both of them very intimately, as such this decision I have made I would argue is very informed.

Now, how is this related to /r/hoggit? Well, you see, I can't do DCS World in Linux. But I want to.

I know a lot of work would be involved, and I can't stress it enough that I am cognisant of this. However, please consider that there are a lot of people that are moving away from Windows to Linux, and that number is going to increase over time. The reasons are all over the place, but there are a lot of those reasons based around not being happy with Windows 10 and the direction Microsoft is headed.

I keep myself subbed to this subreddit because you guys are fucking awesome. I see all the hi-jinks you jackasses get up to, and I feel horribly left out. But despite being on Linux I can't pull myself to unsub from this subreddit because it's just so lovely to keep appraised of the adventures that happen.

I'm a paying customer, and I don't regret that. I would love some day to join you fabulous people, and I hope that might happen. I know ED is going to do whatever they want to do. But I think it sure would be swell if ED would seriously consider the possibility of having native Linux support. Maybe that's Vulkan API, maybe not. And even if ED were to consider it, I know that it would be years out, and I'm okay with that. A10-C is timeless, and so is the braatttt, so if it were to eventually happen, that would just make my day.

I want to join you folks, but I will not be returning to Windows. It's just not okay for me.

Oh, and if there's anything I can do to help facilitate this, please let me know.

That's it. I welcome the downvotes. Thanks for reading :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Seagate Barracudas vs WD REDs, ZFS </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-28 20:08:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay so the price for WD REDs hasn't actually budged in my area for about 2 years. It's about $50/TB and that scales up to even the 8TB drives.

I look at reviews for WD REDs and see Seagate Barracudas kicking their ass for read/write performance by 50MB/s or more ( http://techreport.com/review/25391/wd-red-4tb-hard-drive-reviewed/4 ).

Furthermore, Seagate Barracudas are drastically cheaper than WD REDs. So now I'm torn. WD REDs have TLER and dynamic spindle balancing, so these address some important issues at-scale in storage. TLER I might be able to give up. However I am also concerned about the difference in vibration dynamics between 16xWDREDs and 16xSeagateBarracudas in a SAS Expander/Enclosure. Also, I'm a bit wary after the Seagate 1.5TB issues, but they seem resolved.

What kind of tasty info have you folks been able to kick up in this area of storage?

Currently I am seriously considering Seagate Barracudas. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Need some wicked input on my edge methods. DE blades better some days than others? What? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-17 00:07:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Folks,

I use a feather DE, cheap one, and feather DE blades. I've found that feather is the best blade experience I've had thus far, and I've tried a few other brands.

One thing that I don't understand is why some of my DE blades need to be "broken in", and others don't.

To explain that further, when I feel a blade hasn't been "broken in", it's pretty much painful for me to use it. This isn't the kind of experience I would anticipate from DE, so I suspect I'm doing something wrong.

Any tips please? :) </TEXT>

Anyone know anything about this? If so, please point me in the right direction. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Not-smart TVs, where? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-24 19:39:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm trying to browse for a TV that doesn't have "smart" functionality. Namely, I don't want it to have any applications like netflix, or stuff like that. A TV that displays, has a bunch of inputs (HDMI of course), and quality is what I care about.

Why?

1. It is well documented the security AND PRIVACY concerns around Smart TVs. Just like consumer routers, they're a ticking timebomb.
2. I just want to shove a chromecast and send my media that way.

So, where exactly can I find good TVs that don't have "smart" shit/applications? I'm not having a good time just yet. </TEXT>

I was wondering, anyone playing WoW:Legion in Linux with WINE, have you seen any gains from upgrading your graphics card?

I was thinking of working towards like a 1060/70/80 GTX in the new year, but I'm not sure how much gains I would see in this case. </TEXT>

<TITLE> /r/RenewableEnergy mods </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-21 22:10:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Folks,

I checked the rules, and I _THINK_ this is within the rules. If it is not, please advise me and I'll make the necessary adjustments.

Now, I just wanted to share with you my experience with the /r/RenewableEnergy subreddit. Namely:

1. why I got banned
2. how they responded to me.

- **tl;dr :** http://imgur.com/a/fmFKa -


**I was banned for this comment alone, without warning** ( https://www.reddit.com/r/RenewableEnergy/comments/564x0o/nuclear_power_rapidly_losing_race_with_renewable/d8gkz2l/ )

 If we used Thorium (IIRC?) for nuclear, then we would be set. I'm all for renewable, but nuclear has it's safe place too.

**Post image :** http://imgur.com/wIE9Zwp

That's all I posted, then I was notified:

 You have been banned from participating in /r/RenewableEnergy. You can still view and subscribe to /r/RenewableEnergy, but you won't be able to post or comment.
Note from the moderators:
read the sidebar
If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for /r/RenewableEnergy by replying to this message.
Reminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole.

**Full conversation image :** http://imgur.com/qgOEtqj


So, I got fed up, and forgot about it for... a while. Until... today, which I reached out to the moderation again to see what they had to say. Except it was more of the same:

* me:

 So, am I permanently banned for one comment about nuclear power? Seriously? Don't you think that's kind of heavy handed?

* DonManuel [M]:

 "Don't you think that's kind of heavy handed?"
As much as the ignorance of folks who don't mind to "take responsibility" to leave nuclear waste or the damage from fossils to hundreds of generations in the future.

**Full conversation image :** http://imgur.com/J6d6OA2

Now, why am I posting about this? Because I think it's important to bring to the attention how these moderators (seems like just one though) respond to those who even _talk_ about counter-points.

Yes, my actions were against a rule. I did not intend to break that rule, and I believe I've tried to reasonably approach the mods regarding unbanning and the topic. However, I feel their (his?) response is completely unreasonable.

Furthermore, I really honestly believe this kind of treatment sets back renewable energy development. If we can't even have any reasonable discourse without fear of being banned, then it's yet another form of censorship.

Do with this information as you will, but I felt like I needed to vent/share. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Windows 10 Updates </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-04 00:10:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It blows my mind that Windows 10 breaks so much with updates, as in the ones provided by Microsoft. I'm working with a client right now who's computer goes into hibernation regularly, and some Windows updates (still determining which ones) completely borked the OS, preventing it from booting. Complaining about the storage spaces .sys file.

But, part of the issue is that SecureBoot was enabled, and I was unable to use recovery tools to repair the environment, without turning it off.

I can't stand that Microsoft still has not figured this out. I get that they want the whole boot process to be secure. But it's a real problem when mainstream updates break desktops so easily, and then I have to breach the SecureBoot ecosystem just to get my client back up and running.

Is the issue SecureBoot? I'm not sure. One thing I am sure about though, Windows 10 updates are a gong show. It is unreal how many stories I've heard, and had to deal with, from the Windows 10 update/upgrade ecosystem.

Sorry for the typical rant/vent, but this is absurd. People are paying for this OS, and Microsoft still can't get their act together. Why do we put up with this?

I fully anticipate someone is going to criticize my method regarding SecureBoot. So be it. I need my client up and running, and being locked out of my tools to do that, is not okay. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're not familiar with this, WhatsApp will now share your info with Facebook as of today, in order for you to use WhatsApp. You can "opt-out" of this influencing your ads, but other info _will be shared with Facebook_.

As such, I am trying to find something to switch to, with the following criteria:

* Messaging is end-to-end encrypted, with my keys not stored on external servers.
* I can setup scheduled backups of my messages and keys (onto my phone, so I can sync it to my own server, like, ownCloud)
* The service never, ever, routes through external servers
* It is easy to use, and users do not need to re-accept my keys if I have to wipe my device or replace it for reasons ( device failure, theft, etc)
* For my phone

Signal is a pretty good contender, but they still don't have a way to automate backups, be it of messages OR KEYS.

Anyone have any ideas?

<TITLE> Setting up Open Source Billing, some extra steps I had to take, if you plan to set it up. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-26 22:26:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Folks,

I'm in the process of evaluating : http://opensourcebilling.org/

It looks pretty sweet, but boy was their installation documentation painfully inaccurate. It's supposedly written for Ubuntu 14.04, but I found the issues to be the same in 16.04 too. I was able to finally get it setup with 16.04, and I'm now evaluating it.

If you want to set it up, these are some adjustments that you should consider:

1. You'll probably need to install cmake, I needed it for a few gem install steps.
2. Use ruby 2.1.8, any lower version gave me problems at multiple steps.
3. You'll need to edit the Gemlist to set mysql2 to '0.3.20', otherwise later db actions will barf.
4. Follow the later steps for copying config.yml into place, and do this before the db steps. Some of the db steps didn't complete for me until I did this.
5. In the config/environments/ folder, there's a bunch of files with ".copy" as the final extension. Copy them into place so they're ".rb" (as in, remove the .copy extension on the new files). I am unsure if this is a required step, but it eliminated some complaints I was getting in some db steps.

This looks like the only outstanding steps thus far. I figured I would share what I found, since it took me about 1.5 days of rebuilding just to get these steps. Hopefully this helps someone save time.

Have fun! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Electrical tape, all kinds, opinions pls? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-23 00:06:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Peeps,

I'm a lurking Systems Admin, because I like to see all your guys' work and opinions on stuff, seems like it makes me do a better job (oh man cabling!), and in-turn learn about what you guys hate that others do, so I can avoid making shitty work.

I was hoping you could help me with a particular element... ELECTRICAL TAPE! As such, I would like to hear all sorts of angles on this, not just "the best" kind of angle.

1. First, I personally have some electrical tape that is brand "MK" plus some asian characters. I doubt that's enough information to go on, sorry! How can I tell if it's good enough to actually use at all? Or just a liability waiting to happen? I'm thinking of using it to mask some exposed wire on the cable for my vacuum cleaner, for example.

2. Second, How can I know when electrical tape is shit, and to stay away from it? (as-in don't use it, I'm not talking about electrical tape already placed though)

3. Third, is all "cheap"/"affordable" electrical tape shit? Or is there worthwhile stuff to use?

4. Fourth, what is, the best shit, in your opinion/scientifically proven? (and why?) Budget is not a limiter here.

5. Fifth, any sort of in-between options?

Thanks for your helps peeps! I suspect others would appreciate this info too :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why does Blizzard not release their games natively for Linux? I cannot find a good reason, their games already work on Linux. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-04 00:19:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Consider the following:

1. Overwatch is the only game that Blizzard has released (except Warcraft 1   earlier) that is not playable in Linux (even with work). Every other title that Blizzard has put out is playable in Linux with not much effort:

 1. Warcraft 2 Bnet Edition : [Platinum rating](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version iId=592)
 2. Warcraft 3 RoC/TFT : [Platinum rating](https://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?appId=897)
 3. Diablo : [Silver/Gold rating](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application iId=73)
 4. Diablo 2 : [Platinum rating](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application iId=74)
 5. Diablo 3 : [Platinum rating](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application iId=13484)
 6. Starcraft + Brood War : [Platinum rating](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application iId=72)
 7. Starcraft 2 : [Platinum rating](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application iId=11123)
 8. World of Warcraft : [Platinum rating for all versions](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application iId=1922)
 9. Hearthstone : [Platinum rating](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application iId=15454)
 10. Heroes of the Storm : [Platinum rating](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application iId=15978)
 11. Overwatch : [**GARBAGE** rating](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application iId=17145)

2. Blizzard has a long-standing history of silently co-ordinating with various parts of the Linux community to fix bugs in their games. Some of the more notable examples include accidentally mis-banning massive waves of players in WoW who are playing in Linux legitimately (which they unbanned those players, I was one of them). This also includes staff in-house that run Linux to try and fix these bugs. They have been doing this for over a decade.
3. Overwatch is the only 3D game they've released to not have OpenGL rendering pipelines.
4. It is profitable to release games for Linux, and considering their games already run ~95% functionally or better in Linux, releasing native would be a drop in the bucket relative to their other project developments.
5. Individuals and Businesses can change their mind. Blizzard has recently, quietly, brought on-board the person who asked them at a Blizzcon panel about the vanilla servers being ran by Blizzard. They have demonstrated repeatedly throughout their history that they _can_ change their mind.

So considering all this, one should ask themselves, _why_ aren't they bringing these games to Linux natively? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Playing Heroes of the Storm (HotS) on Linux - Some tips to get you going </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-21 17:00:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, last time I took a look at HotS on Linux, it was unplayable. I'm glad to see it's not only playable, it's [Platinum rated](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version iId=32232).

Now, I use Play on Linux, and there's already a [profile on there](https://www.playonlinux.com/en/app-2627.html), but I was getting some pretty meh performance.

So I tried a few things, and was able to get massive gains, and I think you lovely folks will probably see gains too. This also works for Starcraft 2 and League of Legends.

1. I grabbed "1.9.12-staging" from the PoL builds, this is 32-bit btw, I haven't delved into 64-bit stuffs.
2. Turned on CSMT
3. Set "[Strict Draw Ordering](http://www.gamersonlinux.com/forum/threads/playonlinux-explained-display-settings.266/)" to "disabled"
4. Set to run Windowed Fullscreen mode, because the engine vomits if you alt tab in ordinary Fullscreen mode.

Tada! I can now run High/Ultra/Extreme settings and get the FPS I would expect!

Specs:
1. CPU: i7-980x (stock clocks)
2. GPU: nVidia 960 GTX SFF version (Asus), 2GB RAM
3. Storage: 120GB Samsung 840 SSD
4. RAM: 12GB
5. Monitors: 3 monitors, each 1920x1080, as of testing all in landscape mode

FPS: High detail 60-80+ (still testing)

I get even better FPS in Starcraft 2 and League of Legends! </TEXT>

/Remake launches this patch, testing in NA for around a week before revolving around the world.

If you dont remember, /remake lets you immediately resolve a 4v5 game at the three-minute mark without taking a loss. The missing player tanks responsibility through Leaver Buster for making everyone else requeue.
Rules refresh:

 1. **MIA** If any player dcs or is flagged afk for at least 90 seconds at the three minute mark, a /remake is available. Except in cases of the...
2. **TILT EXCEPTION** A first blood against a players team before they leave/dc will prevent a remake vote
3. **THATS WHY ITS /REMAKE** At the three minute mark, all players on the shorthanded team receive a message to prompt the vote by typing /remake in chat
4. **TIMEWINDER** If the vote passes all players in the game basically pretend the game never happened and experience no change in LP/IP/CM/XP, or W/L records
5. **BOPPED** The dcd player takes the full LP loss (or drops a promo game), and is flagged by Leaver Buster
6. **FOR DIAMOND ONLY** To prevent abuse of /Remake, Diamond V and above players will take a loss when the dcd player is in their premade </TEXT>

Since Quake and id has a major history of running on Linux, I would like your help in getting their attention for this latest title.

Please join me in tweeting id software ( https://twitter.com/idsoftware ) asking them if Quake Champions will be on Linux. If you want to join me, let's use #LinuxGaming as the hashtag.

Let's make ourselves heard. DOOM was already proven to render flawlessly on Linux. Let's not take this lying down.

 apt update    apt upgrade

Goes well.... hit y for all

<TITLE> Get drives with TLER, don't fuck around </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-21 17:12:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Folks,

Something interesting happened to me. One of my drives dropped off because it doesn't have TLER.

As such, I thought it might be worthwhile to demonstrate what it looks like when this happens, and why you should get drives with TLER for your storage systems. To be clear, this is from a FreeNAS setup and the disk is in a ZFS pool.

So, let's cut to the juicy bits. This is the relevant output from /var/log/messages:

What's going on here is that the controller is trying to give instructions to the drive, and the drive isn't responding. So eventually the controller thinks the drive is dead (which it isn't) and detatches it from the working environment.

Now, for the uninitiated, you may be wondering, what does TLER have to do with this? Well, TLER makes it so that when drives have to do sector remaps (which is the most likely case here), and it has issues doing that, then the drive will eventually stop itself from doing it forever, and try to recover the data another way. Since the example drive here DOES NOT have TLER, it is assumed it will try to remap the sector till the end of time, except the controller doesn't want to wait that long, so it drops the drive. If the drive had TLER in this scenario, the drive would have stopped the particular remap command and switched to another sector so the controller could continue to interact with the drive.

But what were the symptoms? How did I know this was happening as it happened?

1. Shitty IOPS, my VMs were running like poop
2. I could not identify any bottleneck (before I saw this happened)
3. zpool status INITIALLY said shit was fine (probably while it was retrying with the disk)
4. EVENTUALLY zpool status showed the disk as "REMOVED"
5. Well, I read /var/log/messages, but I had to scroll up a lot to find it as NFS messages hid it, kinda

So what did I do in this case? Well, what I should do is replace the drive with one with TLER (like WD REDs), but that's not an option at this time. So I first make sure nothing is running against my storage system here, and I reboot (or turn off/on). After that, the pool came back up, and surprise surprise the drive is actually working. It's a good thing I knew this wasn't an entire drive failure, otherwise I might be actually worried here.

**Don't be silly, get drives with TLER (or equivalent). This shit happens.** </TEXT>

<TITLE> Catalyst of Aeons - buffed, but... limited value? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-04 20:50:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay so the "Catalyst the Protector" was renamed to "Catalyst of Aeons" and had the following change, which it seems to me is a buff:

 ETERNITY UNIQUE Passive - 15% of damage taken from champions is gained as mana. Spending mana restores 20% of mana spent as health, up to 15 per cast (toggle spells heal for up to 15 per second).

Now. This seems like a pretty good buff. But I'm looking at the items it builds into, and the effect is lost. So a question is ringing in my head, "so what?".

It seems to me like this effect will be short lived, as a player will want to generally upgrade this into another item only a few minutes after acquiring it.

Or am I somehow missing something here?

Thoughts?

edit: d'oh, missed that rod of ages retains the buff. Still odd the others don't get it?

Now, every page wants me to enter my username and password for server "store.na2.lol.riotgames.com". Entering my username and password changes nothing, I can't use the store in this state. For runes, champs, buying RP, etc.

<TITLE> One cat not using the litter properly, other is. Help! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-23 00:59:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have 2 cats. One is pure-bred bengal, one is a tuxedo cat (yeah I know that's not a breed).

The purebred bengal uses the litter for pooping and peeing properly.

The tuxedo cat does not.

The tuxedo cat poops just outside the litter, no matter where I put it.

The tuxedo cat, I'm not sure all the places she's peeing, but I don't know if it's in the litter or not. I find her peeing on some of the carpet spots.

I've been switching different litters plenty, no change.

I've been using anti-enzyme sprays + carpet washer (without soap) to clean up the carpet stains and try to break the habit.

It's been going on for a while, as in months, and I can't tell you in more detail how long.

I need your help! I love my kitty, and I want to get her back into good habits. When I got her and for years she was using the litter properly. Something I did has caused her to do this, and I don't know what to do next.

Please help! :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Folks,

I'm switching banks. I was considering Tangerine thanks to this post ( https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/2p0bys/starting_clean_with_a_new_bank_cibc_rbc_td_or_bmo/ ). However, I need to be able to pay bills with Interac services.

The thing I'm a little confused about is whether I can pay for things like my cellphone bill with interac? I know there are E-mail transfers, and interac online payments, and they seem like two separate services. But are they?

Can someone advise?

Oh also, fuck BMO.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi,

I'm playing Signed in ARAM because I have no idea how to play him yet.

I have tried to toss a Nocturne in this game a lot, and something bugs out (or appears to) when I try to toss him.

It kinda tosses him, then puts him back. The cooldown gets triggered. I typically die when this happens.

He doesn't have any items that negates spells. So this _seems_ like a bug.

What's up with this? </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Playing on Linux] MASSIVE FPS gain with new wine build </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-31 03:42:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Folks,

If you play League of Legends on Linux, this is for you.

I use PlayOnLinux to manage my wine stuff, and in this case, League of Legends.

I've been playing on the 1.7.52-LeagueOfLegends5 build of wine for a while now. I had to run on all low settings to get 85FPS in battle, which is very smooth and I can play ranked like that. If I turned everything to max (except vsync) I would get about 50FPS, enough to make playing ranked painful, ugh.

I've tried a few builds, but didn't really see any gains... until today.

I switched to 1.9.2-staging-LOL3, making sure to check CSMT is on, and wow it is night and day.

* all low settings, in combat, I now get 150-210+ FPS
* all high settings except vsync (AA on), in combat, I now get 135-160+ FPS

I'm on a GTX 960.

So what's the lesson? USE THE NEW BUILD IT'S RAD!

**UPDATE:**

I'm on an i7-980x + GTX 960, so plenty of beef.

CSMT causes freezing from single threads/cores getting pinned by CPU usage. I tried many methods to correct this, and came close, but it still happens.

I tried:

* switching to 1.7.52-staging-LOL3, freezes still happen
* setting nice on the League programs to lower, freezes still happen
* set x3d_platform=1 in the game's config file, FPS drops massively, freezes leave (why bother though)
* tried __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1 (with x3d_platform =1), FPS still low, freezes gone still (again why bother, low FPS)
* tried above without x3d_platform=1, FPS goes back to massive, and long testing shows freezes leave... until I get into an actual normal game (was testing with bots)

It seems that __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1 helps a LOT, but does not fix the problem. The problem appears to be that something about how the rendering is done just pins a core. Without __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1 it pins two cores.

Once a core or more is pinned the game freezes until it's done whatever it's doing, and the core/thread never unpins (as in 100%) until it's done freezing.

I am out of ideas, I just went back to a not-CSMT build. Sorry peeps :(

We're so close! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-01-02 15:24:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi /r/homelab

I'm trying to troubleshoot some crummy backup performance. I've worked extensively to eliminate the sources, and I'm running out of ideas. So I'm starting to thing it may be the hardware is bottlenecking in a way I can't yet meter.

So I was wondering. Are any of you running proxmox hypervisor nodes, whereby your processor in that node is an AMD FX processor? For example, and FX-8320.

If so, can you share with me your backup performance?

I could go through all the details of my setup, what I've tested, etc, but it would derail what I'm trying to seek here. So please, I would appreciate just sharing what kind of backup performance you have, and telling me how your environment is setup.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay so I'm going for some Microsoft certs right, nothing complex.

When I register for a test, it asks me for a Microsoft account, and I have an old-as-fuck hotmail acct I've used for wiping the floor with.

If I register with this account, and pass the certs, are those certs permanently tied to that account?

It's a pretty dirty account, with like bits of food, cat hair, stuff like that. It seems like I may not want my certs tied to it. I don't want to spread bacteria.

Really though, tips pls? </TEXT>

<TEXT> ***LANified! is proud to announce The LANified! Bootcamp Program - Phase 1***

**LANified! also has new staff openings, further details below.**

**But subject5587, what is The LANified! Bootcamp Program?**

The LANified! Bootcamp Program is intended to provide services which help gamers enter and progress in competitive gaming. The services are similar to how we run our official tournaments, but are operated in an environment where nothing is on the line.

**But subject5587, what do you mean when you say Phase 1?**

We plan to expand The LANified! Bootcamp Program over time. Phase 1 will encompass services around Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, limited live broadcasting, and other related details. We plan that future phases will include expansions in various areas, but cannot commit to what at this time.

**But subject5587, what about the existing CS:GO Scrims?**

The LANified! Bootcamp Program is intended to replace the less-structured CS:GO Scrims.

**But subject5587, who should participate?**

With Phase 1 we are wanting to attract gamers who enjoy Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, in Western Canada, and nearby regions in the USA (NW USA). We welcome established teams, and gamers who have no team (aka ad-hoc gamers). The program is intended for many gamers, and we currently have no limit on the number of participants. The more the merrier! Generally if you ping well to csgo1.lanified.com then you should participate.

**But subject5587, who should not participate?**

We want to keep the atmosphere of the program as friendly and productive as possible. As such those who are hostile, unsportsmanlike, and/or are otherwise generally abrasive are not welcome. We are not going to police your language, but if a gamer starts significantly disrupting the atmosphere of the program, they will no longer be welcome. The program is intended to help gamers and teams grow in competitive gaming, constructive criticism is an effective tool, but hostility and unsportsmanlike conduct is unbecoming of gamers, and will not be tolerated.

**But subject5587, I/We don't have a team, what should I/We know? (ad-hoc gamers)**

Those who want to enter the program as ad-hoc gamers will be given assistance in forming a team for the day. The first step is jumping on our mumble server ( voice.lanified.com default port), then jumping in the "Team Forming" channel, then ask for a Tournament Administrator. Then in the second step, a Tournament Administrator will co-ordinate with you for forming a team for the day. The third step, once your team has been formed, your team will need to elect a captain and inform a Tournament Administrator who your captain is. Choose wisely, as your captain must be the same person for the day! The fourth step, a Tournament Administrator will then direct you to a channel on mumble, and co-ordinate your games against other teams; telling the captain which server the team must connect to, and other relevant details.

**But subject5587, I have a team that wants to participate, what should we know? (established teams)**

Those who want to enter the program as an established team will need to follow a few different steps and meet certain criteria.

An established team must meet the following criteria:

* Have a dedicated STEAM group for the team. The team name will match the name of this group.
* The dedicated STEAM group can have no more or less than 5 members, and all members will be the fielded roster (those allowed to play as that team).
* The team captain must be the Administrator of the group. All established teams require a captain. Only one member can be an Administrator, and in-turn a captain.
* The STEAM group and team roster cannot change members while a team is participating in a day of the program. If a team changes roster/STEAM group members while a program event is in progress, they will become ineligible to continue participation that day, as an established team. Rosters and STEAM group membership is allowed to change when a program event is not in progress.
* The dedicated STEAM group must have a tag prefix.
* While a program event is in progress all team members must select the prefix for the team they entered as.
* All program co-ordination will be performed between Tournament Administrators and team Captains. Captains are expected to co-ordinate their team.
* Register the established team in the team registration thread, following the template outlined in the first post. The thread is at: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/LANified/discussions/0/458604254440182176/

Established teams that meet the criteria will be provided with a vanity channel on the LANified! Mumble server matching their team name. These channels will not have a password, but generally the channel is intended to be used exclusively by the team at their discretion.

Once a team is compliant with the criteria, and then wants to participate in a program event, they must follow these few steps.

* First, all members must join the LANified! Mumble server and be in their team's channel.
* Second, the team captain must check-in with a Tournament Administrator, advising them that the team wants to participate.
* Third, the Tournament Administrator will validate the team's adherance to the criteria, and co-ordinate correction of any shortcomings.
* Fourth, once the team is compliant, the Tournament Administrator will begin co-ordinating with the team captain as to who they are playing against next, what game server to use for the next game, and other related details. During a program event it is expected that the captain take responsibility for their team and compliance with the criteria.

**But subject5587, what did you mean by limited live broadcasting?**

LANified! will begin live coverage of The LANified! Bootcamp Program in a limited fashion. Initially this will be live broadcasting from the perspective of a single team during a program event. Generally which team that is being covered will change from one game to the next. LANified! will broadcast the in-game perspectives of the selected team, as well as their conversation on mumble, at the same time. The live broadcast is likely to have a delay to defuse player ghosting. Ad-hoc gamer teams, or established teams may request that they be broadcasted in their next game, but generally LANified! will select randomly which teams are broadcasted and when. To watch the broadcast head to http://tv.lanified.com

**But subject5587, how can I show that I am interested in The LANified! Bootcamp Program?**

If you are interested in participating (as a player or team), please post in this thread: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/LANified/discussions/0/458604254440186898/

Posting in this thread is not required, but it helps show us and others how many people are interested.

**But subject5587, you mentioned new staff openings for LANified!, what about them?**

LANified! is currently seeking 2-4 Tournament Administrators to expand our existing Tournament Administrator contingent. Interested parties should head to: http://www.lanified.com/news/details/84300

**But subject5587, I have a question, how can I get it answered?**

You can post here, or on one of our many mediums (twitter/STEAM/faceboook/lanified.com forums), or just contact subject5587 directly through STEAM ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/subject5587/ ). We'll do our best to answer questions promptly!

To summarize for quick reference:

* Saturdays and Wednesdays starting at 8pm
* Join as ad-hoc players, or as established teams
* Mumble server is at voice.lanified.com default port
* Broadcasted at http://tv.lanified.com


***We're excited about The LANified! Bootcamp Program and we want to help you enjoy competitive gaming as much as possible! Come join us, it's going to be a blast!*** </TEXT>

During a program event it is expected that the captain take responsibility for their team and compliance with the criteria.

**But subject5587, what did you mean by limited live broadcasting?**

LANified! will begin live coverage of The LANified! Bootcamp Program in a limited fashion. Initially this will be live broadcasting from the perspective of a single team during a program event. Generally which team that is being covered will change from one game to the next. LANified! will broadcast the in-game perspectives of the selected team, as well as their conversation on mumble, at the same time. The live broadcast is likely to have a delay to defuse player ghosting. Ad-hoc gamer teams, or established teams may request that they be broadcasted in their next game, but generally LANified! will select randomly which teams are broadcasted and when. To watch the broadcast head to http://tv.lanified.com

**But subject5587, how can I show that I am interested in The LANified! Bootcamp Program?**

If you are interested in participating (as a player or team), please post in this thread: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/LANified/discussions/0/458604254440186898/

Posting in this thread is not required, but it helps show us and others how many people are interested.

**But subject5587, you mentioned new staff openings for LANified!, what about them?**

LANified! is currently seeking 2-4 Tournament Administrators to expand our existing Tournament Administrator contingent. Interested parties should head to: http://www.lanified.com/news/details/84300

**But subject5587, I have a question, how can I get it answered?**

You can post here, or on one of our many mediums (twitter/STEAM/faceboook/lanified.com forums), or just contact subject5587 directly through STEAM ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/subject5587/ ). We'll do our best to answer questions promptly!

To summarize for quick reference:

* Saturdays and Wednesdays starting at 8pm
* Join as ad-hoc players, or as established teams
* Mumble server is at voice.lanified.com default port
* Broadcasted at http://tv.lanified.com

<TEXT> ***LANified! is proud to announce The LANified! Bootcamp Program - Phase 1***

**LANified! also has new staff openings, further details below.**

**But subject5587, what is The LANified! Bootcamp Program?**

The LANified! Bootcamp Program is intended to provide services which help gamers enter and progress in competitive gaming. The services are similar to how we run our official tournaments, but are operated in an environment where nothing is on the line.

**But subject5587, what do you mean when you say Phase 1?**

We plan to expand The LANified! Bootcamp Program over time. Phase 1 will encompass services around Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, limited live broadcasting, and other related details. We plan that future phases will include expansions in various areas, but cannot commit to what at this time.

**But subject5587, what about the existing CS:GO Scrims?**

The LANified! Bootcamp Program is intended to replace the less-structured CS:GO Scrims.

**But subject5587, who should participate?**

With Phase 1 we are wanting to attract gamers who enjoy Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, in Western Canada, and nearby regions in the USA (NW USA). We welcome established teams, and gamers who have no team (aka ad-hoc gamers). The program is intended for many gamers, and we currently have no limit on the number of participants. The more the merrier! Generally if you ping well to csgo1.lanified.com then you should participate.

**But subject5587, who should not participate?**

We want to keep the atmosphere of the program as friendly and productive as possible. As such those who are hostile, unsportsmanlike, and/or are otherwise generally abrasive are not welcome. We are not going to police your language, but if a gamer starts significantly disrupting the atmosphere of the program, they will no longer be welcome. The program is intended to help gamers and teams grow in competitive gaming, constructive criticism is an effective tool, but hostility and unsportsmanlike conduct is unbecoming of gamers, and will not be tolerated.

**But subject5587, I/We don't have a team, what should I/We know? (ad-hoc gamers)**

Those who want to enter the program as ad-hoc gamers will be given assistance in forming a team for the day. The first step is jumping on our mumble server ( voice.lanified.com default port), then jumping in the "Team Forming" channel, then ask for a Tournament Administrator. Then in the second step, a Tournament Administrator will co-ordinate with you for forming a team for the day. The third step, once your team has been formed, your team will need to elect a captain and inform a Tournament Administrator who your captain is. Choose wisely, as your captain must be the same person for the day! The fourth step, a Tournament Administrator will then direct you to a channel on mumble, and co-ordinate your games against other teams; telling the captain which server the team must connect to, and other relevant details.

**But subject5587, I have a team that wants to participate, what should we know? (established teams)**

Those who want to enter the program as an established team will need to follow a few different steps and meet certain criteria.

An established team must meet the following criteria:

* Have a dedicated STEAM group for the team. The team name will match the name of this group.
* The dedicated STEAM group can have no more or less than 5 members, and all members will be the fielded roster (those allowed to play as that team).
* The team captain must be the Administrator of the group. All established teams require a captain. Only one member can be an Administrator, and in-turn a captain.
* The STEAM group and team roster cannot change members while a team is participating in a day of the program. If a team changes roster/STEAM group members while a program event is in progress, they will become ineligible to continue participation that day, as an established team. Rosters and STEAM group membership is allowed to change when a program event is not in progress.
* The dedicated STEAM group must have a tag prefix.
* While a program event is in progress all team members must select the prefix for the team they entered as.
* All program co-ordination will be performed between Tournament Administrators and team Captains. Captains are expected to co-ordinate their team.
* Register the established team in the team registration thread, following the template outlined in the first post. The thread is at: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/LANified/discussions/0/458604254440182176/

Established teams that meet the criteria will be provided with a vanity channel on the LANified! Mumble server matching their team name. These channels will not have a password, but generally the channel is intended to be used exclusively by the team at their discretion.

Once a team is compliant with the criteria, and then wants to participate in a program event, they must follow these few steps.

* First, all members must join the LANified! Mumble server and be in their team's channel.
* Second, the team captain must check-in with a Tournament Administrator, advising them that the team wants to participate.
* Third, the Tournament Administrator will validate the team's adherance to the criteria, and co-ordinate correction of any shortcomings.
* Fourth, once the team is compliant, the Tournament Administrator will begin co-ordinating with the team captain as to who they are playing against next, what game server to use for the next game, and other related details. During a program event it is expected that the captain take responsibility for their team and compliance with the criteria.

Ad-hoc gamer teams, or established teams may request that they be broadcasted in their next game, but generally LANified! will select randomly which teams are broadcasted and when.

<TEXT> ***LANified! is proud to announce The LANified! Bootcamp Program - Phase 1***

**LANified! also has new staff openings, further details below.**

**But subject5587, what is The LANified! Bootcamp Program?**

The LANified! Bootcamp Program is intended to provide services which help gamers enter and progress in competitive gaming. The services are similar to how we run our official tournaments, but are operated in an environment where nothing is on the line.

**But subject5587, what do you mean when you say Phase 1?**

We plan to expand The LANified! Bootcamp Program over time. Phase 1 will encompass services around Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, limited live broadcasting, and other related details. We plan that future phases will include expansions in various areas, but cannot commit to what at this time.

**But subject5587, what about the existing CS:GO Scrims?**

The LANified! Bootcamp Program is intended to replace the less-structured CS:GO Scrims.

**But subject5587, who should participate?**

With Phase 1 we are wanting to attract gamers who enjoy Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, in Western Canada, and nearby regions in the USA (NW USA). We welcome established teams, and gamers who have no team (aka ad-hoc gamers). The program is intended for many gamers, and we currently have no limit on the number of participants. The more the merrier! Generally if you ping well to csgo1.lanified.com then you should participate.

**But subject5587, who should not participate?**

We want to keep the atmosphere of the program as friendly and productive as possible. As such those who are hostile, unsportsmanlike, and/or are otherwise generally abrasive are not welcome. We are not going to police your language, but if a gamer starts significantly disrupting the atmosphere of the program, they will no longer be welcome. The program is intended to help gamers and teams grow in competitive gaming, constructive criticism is an effective tool, but hostility and unsportsmanlike conduct is unbecoming of gamers, and will not be tolerated.

**But subject5587, I/We don't have a team, what should I/We know? (ad-hoc gamers)**

Those who want to enter the program as ad-hoc gamers will be given assistance in forming a team for the day. The first step is jumping on our mumble server ( voice.lanified.com default port), then jumping in the "Team Forming" channel, then ask for a Tournament Administrator. Then in the second step, a Tournament Administrator will co-ordinate with you for forming a team for the day. The third step, once your team has been formed, your team will need to elect a captain and inform a Tournament Administrator who your captain is. Choose wisely, as your captain must be the same person for the day! The fourth step, a Tournament Administrator will then direct you to a channel on mumble, and co-ordinate your games against other teams; telling the captain which server the team must connect to, and other relevant details.

**But subject5587, I have a team that wants to participate, what should we know? (established teams)**

Those who want to enter the program as an established team will need to follow a few different steps and meet certain criteria.

An established team must meet the following criteria:

* Have a dedicated STEAM group for the team. The team name will match the name of this group.
* The dedicated STEAM group can have no more or less than 5 members, and all members will be the fielded roster (those allowed to play as that team).
* The team captain must be the Administrator of the group. All established teams require a captain. Only one member can be an Administrator, and in-turn a captain.
* The STEAM group and team roster cannot change members while a team is participating in a day of the program. If a team changes roster/STEAM group members while a program event is in progress, they will become ineligible to continue participation that day, as an established team. Rosters and STEAM group membership is allowed to change when a program event is not in progress.
* The dedicated STEAM group must have a tag prefix.
* While a program event is in progress all team members must select the prefix for the team they entered as.
* All program co-ordination will be performed between Tournament Administrators and team Captains. Captains are expected to co-ordinate their team.
* Register the established team in the team registration thread, following the template outlined in the first post. The thread is at: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/LANified/discussions/0/458604254440182176/

Established teams that meet the criteria will be provided with a vanity channel on the LANified! Mumble server matching their team name. These channels will not have a password, but generally the channel is intended to be used exclusively by the team at their discretion.

Once a team is compliant with the criteria, and then wants to participate in a program event, they must follow these few steps.

* First, all members must join the LANified! Mumble server and be in their team's channel.
* Second, the team captain must check-in with a Tournament Administrator, advising them that the team wants to participate.
* Third, the Tournament Administrator will validate the team's adherance to the criteria, and co-ordinate correction of any shortcomings.
* Fourth, once the team is compliant, the Tournament Administrator will begin co-ordinating with the team captain as to who they are playing against next, what game server to use for the next game, and other related details. During a program event it is expected that the captain take responsibility for their team and compliance with the criteria.

**But subject5587, what did you mean by limited live broadcasting?**

LANified! will begin live coverage of The LANified! Bootcamp Program in a limited fashion. Initially this will be live broadcasting from the perspective of a single team during a program event. Generally which team that is being covered will change from one game to the next. LANified! will broadcast the in-game perspectives of the selected team, as well as their conversation on mumble, at the same time. The live broadcast is likely to have a delay to defuse player ghosting. Ad-hoc gamer teams, or established teams may request that they be broadcasted in their next game, but generally LANified! will select randomly which teams are broadcasted and when.

<TEXT> Hey Folks,

I just looked at the times to drive across town and wow is traffic messy out there!

This is a friendly reminder to all of you that you don't _NEED_ to be aggressive on the roads. Life is too short to do something unnecessary and possibly feel the consequences.

Think about what you love in life, play some relaxing music, and take your time. If you're stuck in traffic, just listen to something you _want_ to listen to, and realise it just doesn't matter.

Stay safe peeps, so you can join us in 2016 :) </TEXT>

However, I am uncertain on the best way to do this, and searching has not turned up reliable methods.

Any tips? </TEXT>

<TITLE> nVidia crashing solution, NVRM Xid 13 and 31 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-27 18:44:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Folks,

I wanted to share my collected fix for a problem, one where I had a hard time finding the solution before.

I just switched from an HD 7970 to a 960 GTX, and started getting annoying crashes of X (the graphical system).

Periodically X would crash while alt-tabbing between programs. Fortunately ctrl+alt+f1 came to the rescue, and restarting lightdm got me back in business.

The only tangible log error I was able to find was in /var/log/kern.log

I'm operating in Ubuntu 15.04 64bit.

The errors I saw were:

 kernel: [128366.897889] NVRM: Xid (PCI:0000:04:00): 13, Graphics Exception on GPC 0: 3D-CT KIND Violation. Coordinates: (0x0, 0x80)

.
 kernel: [130148.107274] NVRM: Xid (PCI:0000:04:00): 31, Ch 00000028, engmask 00000101, intr 10000000

.
 kernel: [128366.897900] NVRM: Xid (PCI:0000:04:00): 13, Graphics Exception: ESR 0x500420=0x80000100 0x500434=0x800000 0x500438=0x3d00 0x50043c=0x10017

.
 kernel: [128366.897947] NVRM: Xid (PCI:0000:04:00): 13, Graphics Exception: ChID 0020, Class 0000b197, Offset 000023a8, Data 00000000


Initially what I dug up was that people thought the powermizer was the problem. Forcing it in the nvidia-settings panel to max power was one proposed solution, failing that forcing it as such in xorg.conf. This did not resolve it for me.

I'm at the point where I can confidently say it was due to Application Switcher in Compiz, but not the whole thing, just one setting.

Previously I would crash every other day or so, the period was erratic. I have not crashed all week after turning this off.

In the CompizConfig Settings Manager

1) Go to the Application Switcher

2) Go to the General tab

3) Uncheck Mipmap

Some reading I've done is that mipmap in other compiz modules could cause problems too, so keep your eyes peeled!

Anyway, I'm posting this so others can find it. Be it on here, or via your favourite search engine.

Happy gaming folks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I fucking did it. It's my main OS now, and has been for 2.5mo.

My milestone was getting League of Legends playable enough that I could rank with 60FPS in heated battle. And I did it.

Now, only two games I care about aren't playable for me, GTA V and FO4.

I even have Legacy of the Void playable like a fucking boss.

And it's glorious.

I'm in XFCE4/Ubuntu15.04 and I love my tasty compiz features. Multiple desktops, ctrl+alt+f1 to fix shit if I'm dumb and break something, efficient use of my SSD, you name it, it's fast and oh so tasty.

I love gaming on Linux. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  COMFORT ZONE: All in-game settings (ex. key bindings) are now saved server-side per account, rather than on individual computers.

What about custom item builds/sets? Does anyone know about that?

I tweeted @riotgames and posted on the boards, both times no response :( </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-10-08 20:47:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm in Ubuntu 15.04, and I am using xubuntu-desktop. I switched from xfwm4 to compiz in the session xml. A lot works really well, except pressing ctrl + alt + L does not lock my computer, and also hitting the lock button on the menu does nothing too.

I really need to be able to lock my computer.

Any thoughts on the cause? My searching turned up nothing :( </TEXT>

<TITLE> At the pump... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-27 18:24:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, so consider the following:

* June 2014, barrel of oil is $106.18 [1], and was about this price since 2011

* January 2015 (7 months later), barrel of oil is $48.79 [1], a drop of **45.95%**

* June 2014, price at the pump in Calgary was ~$1.23/L [2]

* January 2015 (7 months later), price at the pump in Calgary was ~$0.81/L [2], a drop of **34%**

Now consider the prices today, 9 months after January 2015.

* Price of barrel of oil, $45.05 [1]

* Price at the pump, ~$1.02/L [2]

So, the barrel has dropped further, and yet the price at the pump has risen. I have difficulty believing that "reserves" are the cause of this, and that reserves can even last as long as they have at this price.

Someone's got some explaining to do.

<TITLE> Libre Office GUI is slow to "draw" on my screen (same with Filezilla) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-18 20:45:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm running Ubuntu 15.04, right now in xbuntu-desktop DE. I have a 7970 and I'm running the AMD updated properietary drivers (15.something, forget exact version).

I am not running a compositor (pretty sure). However, Libre Office is one of the few programs (Filezilla does the same) where the buttons and GUI elements draw soooo slowly. Any resizing or changes to the window causes the whole thing to redraw like it's 1985 again.

Generally everything else is super snappy though, so this is very out of place. I suspect something's not quite set right on my end, but I'm not sure where to begin.

Tips pls? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Earlier this year we awarded "Best in Calgary" to two teams at our LAN parties. One team for CS:GO and one team for DotA 2. We turned this into an awesome photo op and have recently posted them. Check them out in all their glory.

Team CripStix for CS:GO : https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1139772049383215.1073741830.114122358614861 type=3

Team 4 weabs+angela for DotA 2 : https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1177585242268562.1073741831.114122358614861 type=3 uploaded=3

Can they keep their titles? We'll see in the upcoming LAN parties! Each featuring their own "Best in Calgary" plaques and cash prizing.

<TEXT> I have been playing for... a week or two now (android). But I just now got a "What's new" window when I got back into the game. Talking about:

* New incidents, mole rats and deathclaws
* mr handy, now in lunchboxes and the store
* objectives adjusted and rebalanced
* bug fixes, optimizations

But, I thought this was already in here? (At least the first 2 points)

<TEXT> Okay so there's a bunch of information out there about what kind of edition of Windows 10 you will end up with, based on what you upgrade from.

OEMs become OEMs

Retails become Retails

But, what about technet?

I ask because OEM versions of Windows 10 will not re-activate if you swap your mobo, but retails will. So, what about technet?

Eg, Win 7 Ult technet editions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Greetings fellow gamers! 2015 has been a productive year for us, but we're not done just yet! Again, we are announcing **THREE** events! Again, all of which you can secure your seat for **RIGHT NOW**!

Not only that, but we are extending our Best in Calgary series to all three of these events!

**Ladies and Gentlemen, LANified! is proud to announce our next three events:**

[LANified! 22: Glock Blocked](http://www.lanified.com/events/go/19/6)

* Counter-Strike: Global Offensive - Main tournament - **Cash prizing up to $700 + "Best in Calgary" plaque awards!**
* Counter-Strike: Global Offensive - Arms Race Mini-tournament
* Team Fortress 2 - 3v3 KotH format - Mini-tournament


[LANified! 23: Courier Connection](http://www.lanified.com/events/go/20/6)

* DotA 2 - Main tournament - **Cash prizing up to $700 + "Best in Calgary" plaque awards!**
* DotA 2 - TBA - Mini-tournament
* Age of Empires 3 - 8 Player FFA - Mini-tournament


[LANified! 24: Rumble in the Rift](http://www.lanified.com/events/go/21/6)

* League of Legends - Main tournament - **Cash prizing up to $700 + "Best in Calgary" plaque awards!**
* League of Legends - TBA - Mini-tournament
* Age of Empires 3 - 8 Player FFA - Mini-tournament


**But subject5587, what do you mean by Best in Calgary?**

In addition to the cash prizes for these events, the first place finalists for the main tournaments will be awarded glorious plaques declaring "Best in Calgary"! Not only do we want to foster competitions that welcome all players, but we also want to reward those who strive for the top. Each plaque will be personalized after each event with the team's name and the name and handle of each player on that team, then returned to the captain of that team.

**But subject5587, are you going to be playing other games at these LANs?**

Of course we are! These are LAN parties after all, gaming is what it's all about! As people sign up for each event we ask them 3 games they will likely want to play at the LAN party. Then that forms a list ("Game Preference" just below the Tournaments) on the event page, updating with each person who signs up. This way you can find others who want to play a particular game! We all play games from every genre, we love gaming, especially discovering new awesome games!

**But subject5587, I don't know anyone at your events, should I still come?**

**TOTALLY, you really should!** LAN parties are social events, it's about getting people together. They are a perfect place to make friends, maybe join a team, or just find people to game with, it's all good! These are all public events so we welcome gamers of all shapes, sizes and such. We run them for YOU!

**But subject5587, I have a question not outlined here or on the event pages, what should I do?**

Well you can reach me on STEAM ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/subject5587/ ), or post on our forums ( http://www.lanified.com/forums/ ).

**But subject5587, are there other ways to keep up with LANified!?**

Certainly!

In addition to the cash prizes for these events, the first place finalists for the main tournaments will be awarded glorious plaques declaring "Best in Calgary"! Not only do we want to foster competitions that welcome all players, but we also want to reward those who strive for the top. Each plaque will be personalized after each event with the team's name and the name and handle of each player on that team, then returned to the captain of that team.

**But subject5587, are you going to be playing other games at these LANs?**

Of course we are! These are LAN parties after all, gaming is what it's all about! As people sign up for each event we ask them 3 games they will likely want to play at the LAN party. Then that forms a list ("Game Preference" just below the Tournaments) on the event page, updating with each person who signs up. This way you can find others who want to play a particular game! We all play games from every genre, we love gaming, especially discovering new awesome games!

**But subject5587, I don't know anyone at your events, should I still come?**

**TOTALLY, you really should!** LAN parties are social events, it's about getting people together. They are a perfect place to make friends, maybe join a team, or just find people to game with, it's all good! These are all public events so we welcome gamers of all shapes, sizes and such. We run them for YOU!

**But subject5587, I have a question not outlined here or on the event pages, what should I do?**

Well you can reach me on STEAM ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/subject5587/ ), or post on our forums ( http://www.lanified.com/forums/ ).

**But subject5587, are there other ways to keep up with LANified!?**

Certainly!

<TITLE> How to complain to CRTC about internet prices? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-31 09:13:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There's a couple reasons I want to complain to the CRTC about internet prices.

* First, my ISP hasn't increased speeds drastically in over 4 years now, but they keep raising the price.

* Second, I have no reasonable options for business internet plans that give good bandwidth but cost something someone starting a business can afford. Starting plans give 0.5mbps up, you can barely run anything with that!

What part of the CRTC is going to be the most receptive to this? </TEXT>

<TITLE> mouse acceleration, turning it off (15.04) - XFCE4 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-21 03:41:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Folks,

I've been using Ubuntu for a loooong time. Earlier iterations it was very straightforward to disable mouse acceleration, but the last few years it has been painful.

I recently re-installed with 15.04, and also installed xubuntu-desktop after my fresh install.

15.04 in unity, does not seem to have a mouse acceleration GUI element. However, to my surprise, XFCE4 does.

It's actually really easy. The mouse controls in XFCE4 have an acceleration slider in the main window of Mouse and Touchpad.

I figured I would post this, since everyone else seems to talk about stupid launch scripts to force mouse acceleration off each time you launch X.

Well, have fun! I'll get back to gaming in Linux. Btw, CSGO in linux runs like a champ. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You ever have a mouse where it acts like there's a gravity well, either it goes in some sort of weird line, or wont move out of a specific area of your screen without you slamming the mouse?

I just got a new mouse, upgrading from my dying G700. I'm not sure what the cause is. I'm on a QCK+ mousepad that's very new too, so I hope it's not the mousepad.

I just tried switching the USB port, we'll see if that helps.

I can't find anything on the internet that quite is like this, and I've seen it in the past, but I don't know why it happens, and it's happened with other mice on other systems. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Are you in Calgary? Interested in Broadcasting? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hi,

I'm subject5587. You may or may not have heard of me, but I run LANified!, but that's only part of the truth. The other part is that we have a team that **_helps_** me run LANified!, our events and services, and so much more. If you are unfamiliar with what we do I'll cover more of that lower in this post.

**But subject5587, so what?**

Well, we need more help. I want us to do more great things, but in order to do them we need to expand our team. We already have an awesome team, and I think that we should find more awesome people to join.

**But subject5587, what kind of help are we talking about?**

We are looking for people to help with a Broadcasting project we're working on. We welcome everyone to apply, even if you have no experience; We would prefer that you apply instead of hesitate! Experience helps, but not everyone has it.


 **Broadcastingng Position** 

We are looking for multiple people to help us regularly with a project related to Broadcasting that we are working on. Should you be interested in Broadcasting please consider the following:


- Have you ever been involved with any live broadcasting before? Be it a broadcast simply of yourself, an activity you are performing, or a broadcast that involves multiple people and/or activities. If so, please tell us about it/them.
- What do you know about broadcasting?
- What about broadcasting interests you?
- Have you ever done any live or non-live video production? Non-live video production would involve post-recording production and/or distribution. If so, tell us about that.
- What is your schedule like? Where can you contribute from a schedule perspective?
- Do you have a vehicle? (NOT REQUIRED but helps)
- Have you ever been on camera before during a live broadcast? This would include any traditional/network broadcasting, say a news channel interview.
- Is there specific content you would want to be involved with? How flexible are you to content you haven't been involved with before?
- Have you ever operated a video camera?
- Do you have any experience with audio production?
- Have you ever given a speech, presented to an audience, or prepared a presentation?
- Do/have you enjoy(ed) Team Fortress 2?


**To apply, please email me bloodyiron - atT - lanified -dotT- com and include as much information as you can relevant to the position you are interested in. Again we WANT your help, so apply already! Additionally if you want to contribute in other areas than what I have listed here, do reach out to me.**

**But subject5587, who are you? What is LANified!? Why should I help? And why should I not down-vote this into oblivion?**

I am the founder of LANified!. We have been operating for more than 8 years. LANified! has primarily ran LAN parties throughout Calgary, but we have also ran other gaming related events and services. We run gaming servers, a public mumble server, tournaments, and have also provided support for events ran by others. Our website can be found at www.lanified.com . If you want to contact me through STEAM you can reach me at my profile ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/subject5587/ ).

Why should you help? Why should you not down-vote this into oblivion? Well, that's up to you, but what I can tell you is what we do and what I want us to do. We work really hard on running high quality gaming events with the intent to grow the gaming culture in Calgary. This constitutes **both** competitive gaming and social gaming. I believe there are a significant number of gamers in Calgary that want to see more of what we do. We continually receive positive feedback supporting this. If you want to help grow the gaming culture in Calgary, you should probably come and help us do that.

Thanks for your time.

<TITLE> FreeBSD 10.x + SAS enclosures = locate disk? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-29 00:16:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> One of the last technical elements I'm trying to figure out for storage in FreeBSD is locating a disk in a SAS enclosure.

A thread I read ( https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/disk-enclosure-slot-mapping-to-device-names.35461/#post-195415 ) mentions that in 10-RELEASE there is a way you can locate the slot for a disk in a SAS enclosure, but I can't yet find out the method.

Does anyone know of a way to locate a disk in a SAS enclosure in FreeBSD 10.x or 9.x? (RELIABLY?)

Do I need a specific SAS HBA, or has it become widely available as a tool for SAS HBAs? Do I need to use a particular SAS enclosure?

Give me the good news doc! :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Smash Wii U online - WTF nintendo </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-25 03:09:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Nintendo's online experience for Smash Wii U leaves me wanting. It's pretty much the only unpolished part of this game.

First, official stance is that I have to forward ALL 65535 PORTS to my Wii U to alleviate internet issues. This is fucking lazy programming and I'm not doing it because I run services here and I need ports for other shit. The fact I have to forward any ports, let alone _ALL_ of them, is a dated practice and well beyond reasonable expectation of general users. Me working in IT means I know how to do it, but that's no fucking excuse.

Second, me and my friends have inconsistent hosting experience. I can connect to one of my friends, but fuck us if I try to connect to another friend; no matter how hard he tries to open ports. Is this the ISP? Is this Nintendo? It shouldn't matter, gamers shouldn't have to worry about fucking forwarding ports.

Third, I tried to play with another friend, except he can't have multiple people connected to him. So, only one person (it seems) can be connected to his lobby at any one time. We have the host, then we have Person A (me) and Person B (third buddy). When one of us connects to the host, the other gets a big fuck you error code when they try to join. But, when there's nobody but the host in the lobby, magically at least one person (either person) can join.

WTF Nintendo, what kind of quality is this? I love your shit, but this is not the standard I've come to expect of you.

Now fuck off and fix this shit already, I want to smash! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Did you know that current gen AMD FX procs can use unbuffered ECC? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-21 21:11:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, before you start assaulting me for talking about a consumer-grade bit of hardware, consider the following:

- 1) An example mobo ( http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/M5A78LMUSB3/specifications/ ) officially lists support for unbuffered ECC.

- 2) A [H]ardOCP thread with official sources outlines further about ECC support ( http://hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=1675931 )

- 3) The # of cores, the clock speed, and the price of a compelling AMD FX proc ( http://www.memoryexpress.com/Products/MX47008 )

- 4) It may be possible to use 16GB DIMMs to get 64GB within a single system (UNVERIFIED), ( http://www.newegg.ca/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE N=100007951%20600006050%20600082361 IsNodeId=1 srchInDesc=ecc page=1 bop=And Order=PRICE PageSize=90 ), _tasty prices_. Some 16GB DIMMs list as supported, but not sure about 4x of them ( http://www.anandtech.com/show/7742/im-intelligent-memory-to-release-16gb-unregistered-ddr3-modules ).

Why would you want to do this? Well, for a lower-end environment, or for something that really needs high single-core clocks, this is rather relevant. You can build up an environment, even a cluster, for a very reasonable budget and get _a lot done_.

Anyways, just thought you might like to know this. Do with this as you will. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Hear me now fellow gamers!**

Today **LANified!**, **Memory Express** and the **Calgary Comic   Entertainment Expo** are proud to announce a joint effort to bring you awesome video gaming features at the coming **Calgary Comic   Entertainment Expo 2015**!

_You read that right_, the best parts of entertainment culture in Calgary have come together to provide interactive modern gaming experiences at the expo next week.

We will be offering two facets in this conjoined effort. Demonstration and Competition, both of which will be interactive!

Memory Express will have an incredible setup demonstrating the true value in current gaming equipment. You will be able to sample and indulge in the highest grade gaming experience currently offered. There will be multiple systems setup as well as incredibly knowledgeable staff readily available to help demystify the most common question: "Is the hardware really worth it?" Not only that but should you decide you want to make it happen they will be immediately ready to help you figure out your dream rig.

But wait, there's so much more. In addition to the Demonstration setups the joint effort really shines in the Competitive regard!

Immediately adjacent to Memory Express' setup is our interactive tournament area! LANified! will be running interactive tournaments throughout the entirety of the expo! Not only that, but the tournaments are open to **everyone** that makes it into the expo! There will be a different tournament on each of the first three days of the expo and we will be holding finals for all of the tournaments on the fourth day (Sunday). Each tournament will feature prizing at different stages of the tournament and we (LANified!) have specially designed the tournaments to be welcoming to gamers of all skill levels! Furthermore special care has gone into the tournament formats so that you can have an exciting experience without having to over-commit your time.

**_The first stage_** of each tournament will be a King of the Hill format, where we take ready gamers and throw them into the next game! Gamers will be competing for control of the hill and as you continue to win you stay in to face more challengers! Should you reach certain consecutive wins you will earn prizes and even be invited to the second stage on Sunday to enter the exciting finals!

**_The second stage_** of each tournament will take the fiercest gamers from the first stages and pit them against each other to determine who really is the best, battling for a 1st place prize!

The tournament area consists of a raised podium, bleachers and registration/administration. Those who enter the tournaments will be playing on extremely high grade gaming systems provided by Memory Express; enabling you to have the fairest chance in the tournaments and a highly immersive experience! The games will be projected live onto a massive screen on the stage for all to see. Each computer station will be additionally equipped with the finest peripherals: mechanical keyboards, precision mice and high-grade headsets. Additionally the computer stations will come pre-loaded with the games and for the team tournaments pre-connected to an on-site mumble voice server, providing the highest grade voice communications enabling you to co-ordinate with your team effortlessly.

Have you ever seen a gaming competition and thought to yourself, **why not me?** **Why can't I enter that?** How exciting and awesome would that be? **That's what LANified! is all about** and what we're doing here is bringing that incredible experience to you! We _**want**_ you to enter, we _**want**_ you to give it your best and we certainly _**want**_ you to have a blast. Gaming is so much fun and live competitive gaming brings you an experience you simply can't find online. What are you waiting for? **Step up and fight for the hill!**

**_But subject5587, what games are in the tournaments?_**

 * Thursday - Trackmania2 Stadium

 * Friday - Team Fortress 2

 * Saturday - League of Legends

**_But subject5587, how do I enter? Does this cost me anything? Where is this located?_**

If you are already at the expo it doesn't cost you anything extra! The tournaments are only available to those at the expo with a valid expo ticket for the day. However if you have been invited to finals on Sunday and you do not have an expo ticket for Sunday we will be arranging special considerations so that you can enter the tournament finals! This does not grant you access to the rest of the expo, this will be exclusive access to the finals as a finalist.

We will be taking tournament registration at the expo throughout the event. All of this is located in the Agrium Building, about a stone's throw away from check-in for the expo itself (same building). We recommend you enter the tournaments early as we have a limited number of spots for finalists, but if you want to enter later in the day don't let that stop you! Additionally we will generally be keeping a short queue for each match so that gamers don't have to wait long to get in. Just come to our registration/administration table and say "I want in!"

**_But subject5587, why are you choosing these games and formats?_**

We have selected these games and formats because they are fun, easy to pick up, and have a limited time commitment. We wanted to strike a balance between structured competition and accessibility to newcomers. Historically we have seen great success with these games, formats and styles, and we are confident this will deliver on an exciting experience with fair competition. Additionally these games are fantastic for spectating, we want to draw the spectators into the action too!

**_But subject5587, what are the finer details of the tournaments and prizing?_**

The complete details of the tournament formats and the prizing is not yet finalized, we are working to complete that as soon as possible. Some additional scheduling details is available at : http://calgaryexpo.com/gaming/ and we will be posting the rest of the details at a later date.

**_But subject5587, I've never entered a tournament before, am I welcome?_**

EVERYONE is welcome! If you're at the expo, step on up! We understand that not everyone will want to compete, and that there will be those who just want to spectate, but we make it so easy to enter and get involved you really have nothing to lose and so much to gain! Competitive gaming at all levels is a blast and we invite you to join us in the fun.


With so much going on it's understandable if you have more questions than we have answered here. We're ready to take your questions publicly or privately. If you want to contact us privately and directly you can email me (subject5587) at bloodyiron _at._ lanified .dot_. com (obfuscated so I don't get spammed, sorry). And if you want to know more about other events we have coming up (we have 2 LAN parties coming up) just head to http://www.lanified.com

Are you excited? We certainly are! </TEXT>

The tournament area consists of a raised podium, bleachers and registration/administration. Those who enter the tournaments will be playing on extremely high grade gaming systems provided by Memory Express; enabling you to have the fairest chance in the tournaments and a highly immersive experience! The games will be projected live onto a massive screen on the stage for all to see. Each computer station will be additionally equipped with the finest peripherals: mechanical keyboards, precision mice and high-grade headsets. Additionally the computer stations will come pre-loaded with the games and for the team tournaments pre-connected to an on-site mumble voice server, providing the highest grade voice communications enabling you to co-ordinate with your team effortlessly.

Have you ever seen a gaming competition and thought to yourself, **why not me?** **Why can't I enter that?** How exciting and awesome would that be? **That's what LANified! is all about** and what we're doing here is bringing that incredible experience to you! We _**want**_ you to enter, we _**want**_ you to give it your best and we certainly _**want**_ you to have a blast. Gaming is so much fun and live competitive gaming brings you an experience you simply can't find online. What are you waiting for? **Step up and fight for the hill!**

**_But subject5587, what games are in the tournaments?_**

 * Thursday - Trackmania2 Stadium

 * Friday - Team Fortress 2

 * Saturday - League of Legends

**_But subject5587, how do I enter? Does this cost me anything? Where is this located?_**

If you are already at the expo it doesn't cost you anything extra! The tournaments are only available to those at the expo with a valid expo ticket for the day. However if you have been invited to finals on Sunday and you do not have an expo ticket for Sunday we will be arranging special considerations so that you can enter the tournament finals! This does not grant you access to the rest of the expo, this will be exclusive access to the finals as a finalist.

We will be taking tournament registration at the expo throughout the event. All of this is located in the Agrium Building, about a stone's throw away from check-in for the expo itself (same building). We recommend you enter the tournaments early as we have a limited number of spots for finalists, but if you want to enter later in the day don't let that stop you! Additionally we will generally be keeping a short queue for each match so that gamers don't have to wait long to get in. Just come to our registration/administration table and say "I want in!"

**_But subject5587, why are you choosing these games and formats?_**

We have selected these games and formats because they are fun, easy to pick up, and have a limited time commitment. We wanted to strike a balance between structured competition and accessibility to newcomers. Historically we have seen great success with these games, formats and styles, and we are confident this will deliver on an exciting experience with fair competition. Additionally these games are fantastic for spectating, we want to draw the spectators into the action too!

**_But subject5587, what are the finer details of the tournaments and prizing?_**

The complete details of the tournament formats and the prizing is not yet finalized, we are working to complete that as soon as possible. Some additional scheduling details is available at : http://calgaryexpo.com/gaming/ and we will be posting the rest of the details at a later date.

**_But subject5587, I've never entered a tournament before, am I welcome?_**

EVERYONE is welcome! If you're at the expo, step on up! We understand that not everyone will want to compete, and that there will be those who just want to spectate, but we make it so easy to enter and get involved you really have nothing to lose and so much to gain! Competitive gaming at all levels is a blast and we invite you to join us in the fun.


With so much going on it's understandable if you have more questions than we have answered here. We're ready to take your questions publicly or privately. If you want to contact us privately and directly you can email me (subject5587) at bloodyiron _at._ lanified .dot_. com (obfuscated so I don't get spammed, sorry). And if you want to know more about other events we have coming up (we have 2 LAN parties coming up) just head to http://www.lanified.com

Are you excited? We certainly are! </TEXT>

<TEXT> While the FDA is far from perfect, it does prevent vendors and crackpots from selling gimmicks that have, historically, actually harmed and lead to the deaths of people.

While I'm for a modern market, I am curious what can be done to prevent people who either accidentally or intentionally sell shitty products that due to their lower quality could lead to harming someone?

<TEXT> As I think about linux on the corporate desktop I can't help but first think about the hurdles to overcome. But sometimes I think about some of the awesome things you can't do without Linux (or similar) on the desktop.

Consider a software development company, imagine almost all their workstations are Linux. Now imagine they could distribute code compiles among the majority of the company's workstations.

That seems like just the beginning... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dear Calgary, Edmonton and Alberta,

As the founder and head person of LANified! I've seen all kinds of gaming. I've climbed the competitive mountains, I've swam the deep seas of modding, and I've lost countless hours of sleep to awesome gaming.

But I want to know something from you: **What do you want to see from LANified!**?

If you don't know who/what LANified! is or who I am, I'll cover that later.

**Spill it**, all the beans! The good, the bad, the ugly. We have great ideas as to where we want to take LANified!, and boy do we want to bring them to you! But we also greatly value your opinion and thoughts. **We do this for you after all**.

So share with me your real deals, your Thought Tacos, your bittersweets, your *brainssssssss*. Post please!

**But subject5587, who are you and what on earth is LANified!? (and why does LANified! end in an exclamation point?)**

Well you see, I'm a gamer here in Calgary. I've been running LANified! and we've been putting on LAN parties for 8 years now. We love gaming of all kinds! And we do a lot to grow the community here. Perhaps you should check out www.lanified.com </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm trying to use a private instance of chrome or firefox (privacy mode) to browse sections of reddit that I don't want going into my history. Except, after I hit "yes" to me being over 18, it only remembers for one page. Then it won't accept "yes" again until I re-open a privacy window.

This is not how it's been working in the past, and this is really not okay for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So trying to setup a GPO to set the local admin password in a consistent way, only to find out an applied update prevents GPO from doing this, and there is no proper replacement method.

Check this thread : http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/530062-changing-the-local-admin-passwords-across-the-network

The nice thing about doing it in the GPO is that it can apply without our intervention, so as systems come on and offline the changes will apply. But it seems now I have to manually babysit computers as they come on and offline.

Thanks Microsoft, yet another awesome improvement. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Do you like gaming? Do you want to help grow gaming culture in Calgary? Why not join LANified!? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hi,

I'm subject5587. You may or may not have heard of me, but I run LANified!, but that's only part of the truth. The other part is that we have a team that **_helps_** me run LANified!, our events and services, and so much more. If you are unfamiliar with what we do I'll cover more of that lower in this post.

**But subject5587, so what?**

Well, we need more help. I want us to do more great things, but in order to do them we need to expand our team. We already have an awesome team, and I think that we should find more awesome people to join.

**But subject5587, what kind of help are we talking about?**

We are working on a super awesome project and we need a few more people to help us get off the ground so to say with it. We welcome everyone to apply for this, even if you have no experience; We would prefer that you apply instead of hesitate! Experience helps, but not everyone has it.

 **-Non-specific Broadcasting Position**

We are looking for 3 people to help us regularly with a project related to Broadcasting that we are working on. Should you be interested in Broadcasting please consider the following:

* Have you ever been involved with any live broadcasting before? Be it a broadcast simply of yourself, an activity you are performing, or a broadcast that involves multiple people and/or activities. If so, please tell us about it/them.
* What do you know about broadcasting?
* What about broadcasting interests you?
* Have you ever done any live or non-live video production? Non-live video production would involve post-recording production and/or distribution. If so, tell us about that.
* What is your schedule like? Where can you contribute from a schedule perspective?
* Do you have a vehicle? (NOT REQUIRED but helps)
* Have you ever been on camera before during a live broadcast? This would include any traditional/network broadcasting, say a news channel interview.
* Is there specific content you would want to be involved with? How flexible are you to content you haven't been involved with before?
* Have you ever operated a video camera?
* Do you have any experience with audio production?
* Have you ever given a speech, presented to an audience, or prepared a presentation?

**To apply please email me bloodyiron - atT - lanified -dotT- com and include as much information as you can. Again we WANT your help, so apply already! Additionally if you want to contribute in other areas than what I have listed here, do reach out to me.**

**But subject5587, do I get paid for this?**

This is strictly voluntary. We do not compensate  financially or in other specific ways. That being said, we provide valuable experience that can be put on your resume. Many of those that have helped us have leveraged the experienced gained to move their careers forward.

**But subject5587, who are you? What is LANified!? Why should I help? And why should I not down-vote this into oblivion?**

I am the founder of LANified!. We have been operating for 8 years. LANified! has primarily ran LAN parties throughout Calgary, but we have also ran other gaming related events and services. We run gaming servers, a public mumble server, tournaments, and have also provided support for events ran by others. Our website can be found at www.lanified.com . If you want to contact me through STEAM you can reach me at my profile ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/subject5587/ ).

Why should you help? Why should you not down-vote this into oblivion? Well, that's up to you, but what I can tell you is what we do and what I want us to do. We work really hard on running high quality gaming events with the intent to grow the gaming culture in Calgary. This constitutes **both** competitive gaming and social gaming. I believe there are a significant number of gamers in Calgary that want to see more of what we do. We continually receive positive feedback supporting this. If you want to help grow the gaming culture in Calgary, you should probably come and help us do that.

Thanks for your time.

<TITLE> theoretical ZFS HA </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-25 17:19:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Folks,

I just had an idea and I want someone to prove me how it won't work and is dumb. Or it's actually a good idea.

I'm trying to figure out a way to do real HA for ZFS, the penultimate goal is to have fail-over with no dropped/interrupted connections (0 packet loss, 0 ping spikes, etc). Failing that to get as close as possible.

My current thought is this, all the disks are in external SAS enclosures which are connected to an identical (in model and revision) HBA in two systems.

These two systems run Xen in a Remus configuration ( http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Remus effectively RAM states duplicated in realtime between two hosts) and there is a single VM setup with Remus HA running... say FreeNAS for now.

FreeNAS naturally has the HBA's passed through to it, and the idea is that the instance will fail-over in realtime if one of the  hosts fails. Since the RAM state is maintained on both hosts testing of this method (Remus specifically) I have observed in other demonstrations ~20ms-200ms interruption.

Where/how would this fail and why? Or is this just an awesome idea? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello fellow gamers! With 2015 comes a new year, and with our new year we are bringing you even more awesome gaming! Not only are we announcing our next event today, but we are announcing our next **THREE** events today. All of which you can secure your seat for **right NOW**!

**But subject5587, are you mad?**

Mad about gaming, yeah! Sure, it may be a lot of gaming, but we see so many gamers in Calgary, we want you all to come join us and have a blast! Besides, each of the three events has a different set of tournaments, what a selection!

_Ladies and Gentlemen, LANified! is proud to present our **Best in Calgary** series:_

 **LANified! 19: Running with Knives** - [clicky](http://www.lanified.com/events/go/16/5)

* Counter-Strike: Global Offensive main tournament and mini-tournaments (cash prizing up to $700! + "Best in Calgary" award!)

 **LANified! 20: Jungle Jukes** - [clicky](http://www.lanified.com/events/go/17/5)

* DotA 2 main tournament and mini-tournaments (cash prizing up to $700! + "Best in Calgary" award!)

 **LANified! 21: Summoner's Stand** - [clicky](http://www.lanified.com/events/go/18/5)

* League of Legends main tournament and mini-tournaments (cash prizing up to $700! + "Best in Calgary" award!)

**But subject5587, what do you mean by Best in Calgary?**

In addition to the cash prizes for these events, the first place finalists for the main tournaments will be awarded a glorious plaque declaring "Best in Calgary"! Not only do we want to foster competitions that welcome all players, but we also want to reward those who strive for the top. Each plaque will be personalized after each event with the team's name and the name and handle of each player on that team, then returned to the captain of that team.

**But subject5587, with all those games, are you going to be playing other games?**

Of course we are! These are LAN parties after all, gaming is what it's all about! As people sign up for each event we ask them 3 games they will likely want to play at the LAN party. Then that forms a list ("Game Preference" just below the Tournaments) on the event page, updating with each person who signs up. This way you can find others who want to play a particular game!

**But subject5587, I don't know anyone at your events, should I still come?**

Totally, you really should! LAN parties are social events, it's about getting people together. They are a perfect place to make friends, maybe join a team, or just find people to game with, it's all good! These are all public events so we welcome gamers of all shapes, sizes and such. We run them for YOU!

**But subject5587, I have a question not outlined here or on the event pages, what should I do?**

Well you can either post here, you can reach me at _bloodyiron/ (at@) lanified.com (be sure to remove the extra characters of course), or post on our forums ( http://www.lanified.com/forums/ ). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello fellow gamers! With 2015 comes a new year, and with our new year we are bringing you even more awesome gaming! Not only are we announcing our next event today, but we are announcing our next **THREE** events today. All of which you can secure your seat for **right NOW**!

**But subject5587, are you mad?**

Mad about gaming, yeah! Sure, it may be a lot of gaming, but we see so many gamers in Calgary, we want you all to come join us and have a blast! Besides, each of the three events has a different set of tournaments, what a selection!

_Ladies and Gentlemen, LANified! is proud to present our **Best in Calgary** series:_

 **LANified! 19: Running with Knives** - [clicky](http://www.lanified.com/events/go/16/5)

* Counter-Strike: Global Offensive main tournament and mini-tournaments (cash prizing up to $700! + "Best in Calgary" award!)

 **LANified! 20: Jungle Jukes** - [clicky](http://www.lanified.com/events/go/17/5)

* DotA 2 main tournament and mini-tournaments (cash prizing up to $700! + "Best in Calgary" award!)

 **LANified! 21: Summoner's Stand** - [clicky](http://www.lanified.com/events/go/18/5)

* League of Legends main tournament and mini-tournaments (cash prizing up to $700! + "Best in Calgary" award!)

**But subject5587, what do you mean by Best in Calgary?**

In addition to the cash prizes for these events, the first place finalists for the main tournaments will be awarded a glorious plaque declaring "Best in Calgary"! Not only do we want to foster competitions that welcome all players, but we also want to reward those who strive for the top. Each plaque will be personalized after each event with the team's name and the name and handle of each player on that team, then returned to the captain of that team.

**But subject5587, with all those games, are you going to be playing other games?**

Of course we are! These are LAN parties after all, gaming is what it's all about! As people sign up for each event we ask them 3 games they will likely want to play at the LAN party. Then that forms a list ("Game Preference" just below the Tournaments) on the event page, updating with each person who signs up. This way you can find others who want to play a particular game!

**But subject5587, I don't know anyone at your events, should I still come?**

Totally, you really should! LAN parties are social events, it's about getting people together. They are a perfect place to make friends, maybe join a team, or just find people to game with, it's all good! These are all public events so we welcome gamers of all shapes, sizes and such. We run them for YOU!

**But subject5587, I have a question not outlined here or on the event pages, what should I do?**

Well you can either post here, you can reach me at _bloodyiron/ (at@) lanified.com (be sure to remove the extra characters of course), or post on our forums ( http://www.lanified.com/forums/ ). </TEXT>

As you read down the chain some of the thoughts get kind of, curious.

<TEXT> I was wondering if you kind folks wouldn't mind sharing your experience/knowledge on IPS on routers. pfSense can be setup with Snort to just log, or log+block IPS activities. But there are also appliance routers that have their own IPS systems.

What do you know about pfSense's Snort IPS capabilities? What about appliance IPS capabilities?

I really like pfSense, but IPS I'm rather lightweight on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> so I just upgraded my Nexus 4 to Android 5, and Exchange keeps reporting it has crashed, then the dialogue goes away quickly. This happens every 5 seconds or so, and so far I have not found a solution.

How in the fuck does Google still have Exchange support not figured out? Is this a Microsoft EEE thing? :S

Any tips/ideas? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Turns out /r/android doesn't take kindly to this kind of issue, so I suspect this may be a good place to talk about this.

I just upgraded my Nexus 4 to Android 5, and now Exchange Services keeps saying it has crashed, except the prompt to hit Ok/Report only stays up for a few seconds. Then it "crashes" again like 5 seconds later, and keeps doing this.

I've tried rebooting, tried stopping the service, deleting cache, and a few other things.

Anyone seen this, ideas?

It's kind of incredible that Google still can't get EAS shit right. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi,

I'm subject5587. You may or may not have heard of me, but I run LANified!, but that's only part of the truth. The other part is that we have a team that **_helps_** me run LANified!, our events and services, and so much more. If you are unfamiliar with what we do I'll cover more of that lower in this post.

**But subject5587, so what?**

Well, we need more help. I want us to do more great things, but in order to do them we need to expand our team. We already have an awesome team, and I think that we should find more awesome people to join.

**But subject5587, what kind of help are we talking about?**

We have one specific position we are looking to fill, and I have a few less than specific positions I want us to fill. Additionally I am open to keen gamers with keen ideas. We welcome everyone to apply for these positions, even if you have no experience; We would prefer that you apply instead of hesitate! Experience helps, but not everyone has it.

 **-Tournament Administrator**

We are looking for someone to join our Tournament Administration team. Primarily we are looking for someone to assist with tournaments at LAN parties but we also would appreciate help with other projects related to tournaments. Should you be interested in this position, please consider the following:

* Have you ever entered a tournament of any size for any purpose (gaming or not)? If so, please tell us about it. Tell us how many tournaments you have entered, what you remember about their formats, what you thought about them (subjectively/personally), what you think could be done to improve tournaments, how you did in them, and/or any other information you would like to include.
* Have you ever ran a competitive team, or participated on a competitive team at any level of competition? This can include participating/running a team simply on a ladder, or all the way up to competing professionally. If so, please tell us all about that.
* Have you ever participated in the operations of a tournament before? If so, what formats are you familiar with, what was your involvement, and any other details you would like to include.
* What interests you about tournaments, their operations, or anything else you would like to express to us.

 **-Non-specific Broadcasting Position**

We are looking for 5-7 people to help us regularly with a project related to Broadcasting that we are working on. There are multiple areas a person can contribute to this, so if one area doesn't work for you another may. Should you be interested in Broadcasting please consider the following:

* Have you ever been involved with any live broadcasting before? Be it a broadcast simply of yourself, an activity you are performing, or a broadcast that involves multiple people and/or activities. If so, please tell us about it/them.
* What do you know about broadcasting?
* What about broadcasting interests you?
* Have you ever done any live or non-live video production? Non-live video production would involve post-recording production and/or distribution. If so, tell us about that.
* What is your schedule like? Where can you contribute from a schedule perspective?
* Do you have a vehicle? (NOT REQUIRED but helps)
* Have you ever been on camera before during a live broadcast? This would include any traditional/network broadcasting, say a news channel interview.
* Is there specific content you would want to be involved with? How flexible are you to content you haven't been involved with before?
* Have you ever operated a video camera?
* Do you have any experience with audio production?
* Have you ever given a speech, presented to an audience, or prepared a presentation?

**To apply to either of these positions please email me bloodyiron - atT - lanified -dotT- com and include as much information as you can relevant to the position you are interested in. Again we WANT your help, so apply already! Additionally if you want to contribute in other areas than what I have listed here, do reach out to me.**

**But subject5587, do I get paid for this?**

These positions are strictly voluntary. We do not compensate for them financially or in other specific ways. That being said, we provide valuable experience that can be put on your resume. Many of those that have helped us have leveraged the experienced gained to move their careers forward.

**But subject5587, who are you? What is LANified!? Why should I help? And why should I not down-vote this into oblivion?**

I am the founder of LANified!. We have been operating for more than 7 years. LANified! has primarily ran LAN parties throughout Calgary, but we have also ran other gaming related events and services. We run gaming servers, a public mumble server, tournaments, and have also provided support for events ran by others. Our website can be found at www.lanified.com . If you want to contact me through STEAM you can reach me at my profile ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/subject5587/ ).

Why should you help? Why should you not down-vote this into oblivion? Well, that's up to you, but what I can tell you is what we do and what I want us to do. We work really hard on running high quality gaming events with the intent to grow the gaming culture in Calgary. This constitutes **both** competitive gaming and social gaming. I believe there are a significant number of gamers in Calgary that want to see more of what we do. We continually receive positive feedback supporting this. If you want to help grow the gaming culture in Calgary, you should probably come and help us do that.

Thanks for your time.

I am checking out tf2 trading post (tf2tp.com), and it looks alright. But, is there an alternative to tf2outpost that is highly used and close in functionality? Some alternatives I've found to be really clunky, like dispenser.tf. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-10-24 22:05:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Naturally we have system images. We are considering switching the HDDs on some of our laptops to SSDs and I was wondering if we had to adjust our system image for TRIM to be enabled when re-imaging a laptop?

So, we use the OOBE without an answer file (for now) when we capture our system image. Then the laptop gets setup with devices when it's imaged from that image. So, I suspect that TRIM is enabled if an SSD is detected from this process, but I'm not sure.

Does anyone know? </TEXT>

<TITLE> SATA Transport Protocol + SAS enclosures </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-27 02:52:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Folks,

i am trying to find some conclusive material for one way or the other. Consider the application is ZFS for the time being, so HBA's the whole way, no RAID controllers.

In regards to big storage, SAS and SAS enclosures. Using SATA drives in SAS enclosures results in the SATA Transport Protocol being used instead of just native SAS.

Now the first question, what are the limitations, if any, as to how many SATA drives you can reasonably have on a single controller? Let's assume a single 4x SFF-8088 connection, daisy chained as far as we can.

Is there a point where functionality or performance actually starts degrading? Or is it just a ceiling?

Is this ever a BAD idea, and why?

I can't yet find anything conclusive to answer any of these questions in either direction. Please share with me what you can, and try to back it up as best you can with evidence, instead of hearsay.

Thanks :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> What hasn't already been said? It's a gong show. Lights in places that are incredibly disruptive, not enough lanes to support how much flow is fed onto it, and some roads that should connect to it, don't.

I'm of course talking about the areas north of 33rd ave sw and south of 32nd ave nw.

It's always a problem, and when things just happen to go wrong, like an accident, or bad weather, it pretty much destroys travel in this area of the city and traffic spills out all over the place, such as onto 14th st. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Litter Kwitter with two cats, need some advice please! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-31 05:16:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm training two young cats to use the Litter Kwitter. One of which is catching on like gang busters, the other not so much for the stage we're at.

Both cats were using it when it was on the ground. But then I moved it to on the toilet, and only one pees and poohs on it. The other one only pees on the seat, but poos on the floor around the toilet.

The weird thing is, a handful of months ago when I was first trying to train them, the second one was pooing on the seat, but unfortunately I had to interrupt that training, and ended up starting over a few months later.

So, I'm not having really any luck or ideas about how to convince the second cat (tuxedo cat named Onyx) to poo on it when it's on the seat.

Please help! </TEXT>

<TEXT> LANified!'s Minecraft Multiverse just got even better!

Today we've launched strong counter-griefing mechanisms which guard against problems, while ensuring that people are still welcome to come join the fun!

As of right now every new player is put into an Untrusted group. These players can connect to the Multiverse and scout around, but they cannot interact with the environment at all! This makes it so that players can see what all the fuss is about, decide where they want to pitch camp, and get to know the existing player base (chat still works of course).

So what are you waiting for? Come join in on the awesome action!

For details about this new system, please check this out: http://www.lanified.com/news/details/84193

<TITLE> XFCE multi-monitor controls suck my asshole </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-29 23:38:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm running on a Radeon 7970 with the open-source drivers on Ubuntu 14.04, and I'm running XFCE to squeeze out some more FPS. I also have three monitors, one on DVI, one DP to DVI, one DP to HDMI.

Configuring multiple monitors in Unity is quite reasonable.

Doing so in XFCE, is a god damn nightmare.

1) The display settings update IMMEDIATELY when I change them, there's no apply function, so if I accidentally set something wrong, OR HAVEN FORBID I WANT TO CHANGE MORE THAN ONE FUCKING SETTING AT A TIME, it just applies it no matter what.

2) The settings I set are often reverted to some random alternative which I didn't fucking set. Left of X monitor can randomly change to Same as Y monitor, etc.

3) During setting up of the three monitors to be just how I want it to, it decided closing my open applications was an acceptable thing to do. No warning, nothing, just fuck you, you're closing.

4) There's no preview of this process, and sometimes the identify function actually doesn't correctly identify a monitor, especially when you have "same as X monitor" set somewhere.

5) Often the configurations you set don't actually work like they're supposed to. Left of? Fuck you I'm right of, or I'm just cloning a random monitor.

All in all, XFCE may be rather light-weight, but their multiple monitor support is archaic and asinine.

WHAT THE FUCK GUYS. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Are you ready for copious amounts of gaming this weekend? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-20 17:41:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Time is upon us, and our LAN party is this weekend! But are you ready?

Well, if you're not certain on what to bring, we have a recommended list of what to bring and what not to bring on the event details page ( http://www.lanified.com/events/go/14/9 ).

It's pretty common for people to forget just one certain thing, such as a mouse pad, so even if you're a seasoned veteran of LAN parties it's usually a good idea to review what you're bringing before you've left for the event, instead of realizing as you set up that you forgot your power cord.

**But subject5587, what if I'm just coming to spectate or visit?**

Well, at least bring some pants, please. Otherwise, what you bring is up to you. You can always come scope out the event and come back with your equipment later in the day.

Oh, and while I have your attention, I would like to comment on a concern that has been raised to me multiple times. Some people are concerned about what happens if we don't have enough teams at the event. So, what does happen? Well you should know that we currently do team registration at the event (the schedule will be posted later today), and if there are enough teams we run the tournament. However, if there are not enough teams the event **does** continue.

You see, the event isn't just about the tournaments, it's about gaming in many different ways! While there is a possibility that a main tournament may not happen due to insufficient entrant teams, that doesn't mean the rest of the event stops. We will still be running the mini-tournaments, and there will be plenty of social/ad-hoc gaming going on! Many people through our sign-up process have already expressed that they will be playing DotA2 and/or League of Legends, not necessarily in the tournaments, in addition to many other games.

So what are you waiting for, come on down! Join us this weekend and have a blast. For full event details head to: http://www.lanified.com/events/go/14/9

<TEXT> Hey Folks, I'm subject5587. It's likely you have seen me since I run LANified!

There are a lot of DotA 2 players in Calgary, but it seems many of them aren't sure how exactly to connect with each other. Well I believe we can help.

How can we help? We have a lot of people in our STEAM group that are in Calgary and enjoy DotA 2, so check out our STEAM group ( http://steamcommunity.com/groups/LANified#members ) as a start.

Additionally, how about you post in this thread? Just say your handle, link to your steam profile, and add whatever else you want. I'm sure many other people will appreciate this; and you may want to join our STEAM group to find others to game with.

But what else can we do to help? Well, next weekend we have our LAN party. We're running a DotA 2 tournament, and there will be plenty of people there playing DotA 2. So even if you're not interested in the tournament, if you come you will find plenty of other people there to play DotA 2 with. If you haven't seen the full details, check them out: http://www.lanified.com/events/go/14/8

There are lots of people who play DotA 2 in Calgary, I see them all over the place, and we're working to get us all connected! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Attention fellow gamers! Our absolutely fabulous and awesome upcoming LAN party is just a stone's throw away! **LANified! 17: MOBA Madness** runs from Sat June 21st (10am) to Sun June 22nd (6pm).

**More and more people are signing up and securing their seats by prepaying with every passing day!**

**But subject5587, why should I attend your LAN parties?**

Our LAN parties are the best run LAN parties around! We ensure that you have a fantastic time! There will be main and mini tournaments, social gaming, lots of file sharing and so much more. Our LAN parties are an incredibly social event, where you can meet many gamers just like yourself, beat them in games and make friends while you're at it!

**But subject5587, what tournaments will you be running?**

* DotA 2 5v5 - Round-Robin

* League of Legends 5v5 - Round-Robin

* DotA 2 - Ability Draft - Mini-Tournament

* League of Legends - ARAM - Mini-Tournament

**But subject5587, tournaments are intimidating, do I have to enter them?**

No! Tournaments are completely optional! While they are included in your entrance fee, what you want to do at the event is completely up to you! Tournaments are a structured segment of the event that we run for those that are interested in competition, and we also run less serious mini-tournaments which are incredibly fun in their own right. While everyone is welcome to tournaments, we also welcome you to enjoy many other aspects of the social atmosphere of the LAN instead!

**But subject5587, I need help forming/finding a team, what should I do?**

We recommend you post in this thread: http://www.lanified.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=21 t=84185

**But subject5587, how can I know I will have fun at your LAN parties?**

<TEXT> Attention fellow gamers! Our absolutely fabulous and awesome upcoming LAN party is just a stone's throw away! **LANified! 17: MOBA Madness** runs from Sat June 21st (10am) to Sun June 22nd (6pm).

**More and more people are signing up and securing their seats by prepaying with every passing day!**

**But subject5587, why should I attend your LAN parties?**

Our LAN parties are the best run LAN parties around! We ensure that you have a fantastic time! There will be main and mini tournaments, social gaming, lots of file sharing and so much more. Our LAN parties are an incredibly social event, where you can meet many gamers just like yourself, beat them in games and make friends while you're at it!

**But subject5587, what tournaments will you be running?**

* DotA 2 5v5 - Round-Robin

* League of Legends 5v5 - Round-Robin

* DotA 2 - Ability Draft - Mini-Tournament

* League of Legends - ARAM - Mini-Tournament

**But subject5587, tournaments are intimidating, do I have to enter them?**

No! Tournaments are completely optional! While they are included in your entrance fee, what you want to do at the event is completely up to you! Tournaments are a structured segment of the event that we run for those that are interested in competition, and we also run less serious mini-tournaments which are incredibly fun in their own right. While everyone is welcome to tournaments, we also welcome you to enjoy many other aspects of the social atmosphere of the LAN instead!

**But subject5587, I need help forming/finding a team, what should I do?**

We recommend you post in this thread: http://www.lanified.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=21 t=84185

**But subject5587, how can I know I will have fun at your LAN parties?**

<TEXT> Good news everyone! LANified!'s next LAN party is coming up, **LANified! 17: MOBA Madness**, and we would love for you to come have a great time with us! There will be multiple tournaments (up to $800 cash prize pool!) and lots of social gaming!

Doors open 10 am Saturday June 21st and the event runs continually till 6 pm Sunday June 22nd!

**But subject5587, what tournaments will you be running?**

-DotA 2 5v5 - Round-Robin

-League of Legends 5v5 - Round-Robin

-DotA 2 - Ability Draft - Mini-Tournament

-League of Legends - ARAM - Mini-Tournament

**But subject5587, where do I find out more? Can I sign-up, or perhaps buy entrance ahead of time?**

We certainly do have more details, and you can sign-up/prepay too! For the full event details head to: http://www.lanified.com/events/go/14/7

**But subject5587, I haven't been to a LAN before, can I come poke my head in the door at the day of the event?**

You certainly can! If you want to see what the event is like before you plonk down your heard earned money just come on down and we'll gladly show you what it's all about! But be aware we only have so many seats, so when we run out you're out of luck!

**But subject5587, I need help forming/finding a team for DotA 2 or League of Legends, what should I do?**

Well if you want to live dangerously you can always form/find a team at the event, but if that's not your bag we recommend you post in/read our team forming thread on our forums: http://www.lanified.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=21 t=84185 or join our STEAM group and talk to others about forming/finding a team for the event: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/LANified

**But subject5587, I want to play other games! What about me?**

By all means, come and join us for plenty of gaming outside the tournaments! People often ask us, why not run x tournament? Well it's simply not feasible to run a tournament for every single game out there, but there are plenty of people that come to the events and play whatever game they want despite that! When people sign up for each event we ask them what games they want to play, we then tally those up and present the continually updated list under the "Game Preference" section of the event details page ( http://www.lanified.com/events/go/14/7 ). It makes it easy to see who wants to play what games. </TEXT>

Doors open 10 am Saturday June 21st and the event runs continually till 6 pm Sunday June 22nd!

**But subject5587, what tournaments will you be running?**

-DotA 2 5v5 - Round-Robin

-League of Legends 5v5 - Round-Robin

-DotA 2 - Ability Draft - Mini-Tournament

-League of Legends - ARAM - Mini-Tournament

**But subject5587, where do I find out more? Can I sign-up, or perhaps buy entrance ahead of time?**

We certainly do have more details, and you can sign-up/prepay too! For the full event details head to: http://www.lanified.com/events/go/14/7

**But subject5587, I haven't been to a LAN before, can I come poke my head in the door at the day of the event?**

You certainly can! If you want to see what the event is like before you plonk down your heard earned money just come on down and we'll gladly show you what it's all about! But be aware we only have so many seats, so when we run out you're out of luck!

**But subject5587, I need help forming/finding a team for DotA 2 or League of Legends, what should I do?**

Well if you want to live dangerously you can always form/find a team at the event, but if that's not your bag we recommend you post in/read our team forming thread on our forums: http://www.lanified.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=21 t=84185 or join our STEAM group and talk to others about forming/finding a team for the event: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/LANified

**But subject5587, I want to play other games! What about me?**

By all means, come and join us for plenty of gaming outside the tournaments! People often ask us, why not run x tournament? Well it's simply not feasible to run a tournament for every single game out there, but there are plenty of people that come to the events and play whatever game they want despite that! When people sign up for each event we ask them what games they want to play, we then tally those up and present the continually updated list under the "Game Preference" section of the event details page ( http://www.lanified.com/events/go/14/7 ). It makes it easy to see who wants to play what games. </TEXT>

<TITLE> litter kwitter difficulty, please help! </TITLE>

<TEXT> I've been trying to get my two cats trained on the littler kwitter. I have a bengal, and a short hair black cat (tuxedo).

Many months ago when I first started training them I was able to get them both to defecate on the toilet, but sometimes urinate on the floor. However I had to stop this training and go back to littler for a few months due to tenant issues, bleh.

I'm back at it, and we have the red stage on the toilet now. Both cats embraced using the littler kwitter on the floor, but when I moved it to the toilet this time, only the bengal has been defecating on the littler kwitter. The tuxedo cat seems to only defecate on the floor around the toilet.

The tuxedo cat is a bit of a chubby cat, but she can jump up and down things without any real problem.

I've tried scrubbing the areas she poos, changing the scent, putting things in the way, picking her up and putting her on the litter kwitter and trying to demonstrate the position she needs to be in, and try to make her comfortable with it.

I'm kind of out of ideas, can anyone advise? </TEXT>

You certainly can! If you want to see what the event is like before you plonk down your heard earned money just come on down and we'll gladly show you what it's all about! But be aware we only have so many seats, so if we run out we can't simply portal in more space! You can also check out a timelapse video of one of our past events: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPuaHGpbwlU

<TEXT> As I tried to fall asleep I had an ultra meta thought.

When I'm playing csgo I have a lot of fun, until I die. Then I'm sitting there all fed up because I can't play until the round is over, which usually takes a while.

As I was trying to sleep, it occurred to me. When I'm on a killing streak, I'm the worst person. Because I'm causing the same suffering to the entire other team. They're having less fun because I'm succeeding.

Is this really who I want to be? :S </TEXT>

<TITLE> why use vertcoin? it's profits are similar to other coins </TITLE>

<TEXT> Okay so I have a bunch of 280x's. I get on average like 720KH/s with scrypt coins. I believe I could get 300-350KH/s with vertcoin algortyhms (scryptn?).

By what I'm reading of profitability, I would be making similar amounts between say, WDC and vert if I mined either right now.

So, why should I mine vertcoin?

I'm not looking for an ideology discussion here. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay so my disks all show okay, except one disk shows "PFA". But that disk is brannnnddd new. I've also done multiple media patrols against the enclosure and it still sticks at PFA.

The pattern is 3x quick beeps, pause, 1x quick beep, pause, 1x quick beep.

I can't find just yet what that pattern means, and I couldn't find anything super helpful in the manual or online resources.

Turninb off the buzzer doesn't stop the beeping, which is annoying, especially when determining WHICH system initially was having issues in my rack.

Any tips/ideas? </TEXT>

I'm not okay with giving up biometrics info (fingerprints/blood/dna/retina, things that can never change).

Does anyone know what the privacy law in Canada is around things like this? I don't want this to be a point of tension with my job, but it may be at some point, and I'd like to do my homework first.

<TEXT> I'm running a squid 3.1 proxy in transparant mode (as far as I can tell, the documentation is confusing at times).

Sometimes for new sites it has DNS issues:

 Unable to determine IP address from host name www.website.com

 The DNS server returned:

 No Address records

I have to refresh a few times, and then resolution works for a while. Sometimes for sites i've been to before it "forgets" dns info.

So far as I can tell the host it's on can properly resolve public hosts, so I don't know why it's having these issues.

Any ideas? My googling turned up nothing relevant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Alert!** Calgary gaming event **LANified! 16: Reloaded** is only two weeks away!

We're putting together an extremely fun gaming event for you and many other gamers just like you. It runs from Saturday March 8th 10am to Sunday March 9th 6pm, non-stop!

We'll be running CSGO and TF2 for main tournaments with a $800 cash prize pool! We also will be running CSGO/TF2/Quake1 mini-tournaments, and there will be lots of other social gaming (such as League of Legends, etc).

**But subject5587, why should I come to a LAN party? I can play games online!**

LAN parties are great places to meet lots of gamers, and then kick their ass in your game of choice! Not only do you get to win prizes by entering our tournaments and mini-tournaments, but you get to discover new games too. Lots of games will be played, and maybe you'll discover some you've never heard of before! Gaming at a LAN party is unlike gaming online. It's exciting, it's immediate, and it's all around you. You'll hear plenty of other gamers having a great time, and it's infectious. It's an experience unmatched by online gaming.

**But subject5587, why should I prepay?**

Prepaying gets you the best price for entry. Prepay is open only until Feb 23rd 6pm, and space is limited! Prepaying also guarantees you a seat, and we never over-sell prepays. Prepaying is processed instantly and we accept paypal for prepayments at this time.

**But subject5587, I want to play other games! What about me?**

Well we simply cant run a tournament for every single game out there, that's just not possible! But that doesn't mean you can't come and play other games anyways. When people sign up for our events we ask them what games they want to play and we put that info in a list on the events page under "Game Preference" so others can find what games you want to play and vice versa!

**But subject5587, where do I find out more about the event?**

The event page with all the details is at : http://www.lanified.com/events/go/13/12 . But if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to post in this thread!

**But subject5587, I want a bigger event. These smaller LANs are boring, not enough people attend!**

Well, a 50 person LAN isn't as big as the biggest ones in the world, but it still is a lot of people! The best thing you can do however is just attend! We grow by having more people attend. If you want esports and social gaming to grow in Calgary, show your support and get your butt to the event! What are you waiting for? </TEXT>

Also, feels = opinion, but if you have experience or studies/data to back it up please share!

This is mostly about Z1, so please speak about Z1 before Z2 or Z3. Thanks for your input! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good news everyone! We have our next event coming right up in a month, **LANified! 16: Reloaded**, and we would love for you to come have a great time with us! There will be multiple tournaments ($800 cash prize pool!), great food (on-site concession) and generally lots of gaming!

Doors open 10 am Saturday March 8th and the event runs continually till 6 pm Sunday March 9th! Yes, we are talking about a LAN party in Calgary Canada.

**But subject5587, what tournaments will you be running?**

-Counter-Strike: Global Offensive 5v5

-Team Fortress 2: 3v3

-CS mini tournament

-TF2 mini tournament

-Quake 1 FFA mini tournament

**But subject5587, I want to play other games! What about me?**

Well we simply cant run a tournament for every single game out there, that's just not possible! But that doesn't mean you can't come and play other games anyways. When people sign up for our events we ask them what games they want to play and we put that info in a list on the events page under "Game Preference" so others can find what games you want to play and vice versa!

**But subject5587, how many of my friends can you fit?**

We're fully equipped to handle up to 50 attendees plus staff! So make sure to bring your friends and let us know that you're coming.

**But subject5587, where do I find out more? Can I sign-up, or perhaps buy entrance ahead of time?**

We certainly do have more details, and you can sign-up/prepay too! For the full event details head to: http://www.lanified.com/events/go/13/8

**But subject5587, I haven't been to a LAN before, can I come poke my head in the door at the day of the event?**

You certainly can! If you want to see what the event is like before you plonk down your heard earned money just come on down and we'll gladly show you what it's all about! But be aware we only have so many seats, so if we run out we can't simply portal in more space! You can also check out a timelapse video of one of our past events: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPuaHGpbwlU

**But subject5587, I need help forming/finding a team for TF2 or CSGO, what should I do?**

Well if you want to live dangerously you can always form/find a team at the event, but if that's not your bag we recommend you post in/read our team forming thread on our forums: http://www.lanified.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=21 t=84170 or join our STEAM group and talk to others about forming/finding a team for the event: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/LANified

**But subject5587, I have a question that I can't find an answer for somewhere, what do I do?**

<TEXT> Okay so the included ka-50 training videos for Black Shark 2 are way lower quality than the ones for the A-10C. There's a fair bit lacking in terms of even the startup and take-off instructions.

I've followed the instructions and my chopper keeps just pulling back when I try to take off, and I'm pretty sure my joystick is not mis-calibrated.

Can someone point me to some professional and complete ka-50 training videos please? </TEXT>

<TITLE> rtorrent: how to watch multiple folders and save to corresponding folders (torrent files) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-12-06 13:15:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm posting this here because the documentation is confusing to say the least. I hope this is helpful to at least someone.

I'm using Ubuntu 12.04.

I've installed the following packages (last I checked) since fresh install:

* rtorrent meta package (it seems to pull in all I need for packages out of the box)

I then downloaded the following sample .rtorrent.rc file to start with: http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/export/1272/trunk/rtorrent/doc/rtorrent.rc (if this hyperlink breaks, to people in the future, this just demonstrates example parameters, all the parameters you actually need to get started are below)

I then modified the following settings:

* upload_rate = 200 (just so I don't destroy my internet while testing)
* schedule = tied_directory,10,10,start_tied=
* schedule = untied_directory,10,10,close_untied=
* schedule = watch_directory_1,11,10,"load_start=/mnt/something/watch/general/*.torrent,d.set_directory=/mnt/something/general/"
* schedule = watch_directory_2,11,10,"load_start=/mnt/something/watch/linuxISOs/*.torrent,d.set_directory=/mnt/something/linuxISOs/"
* schedule = watch_directory_3,11,10,"load_start=/mnt/something/watch/BSDISOs/*.torrent,d.set_directory=/mnt/something/BSDISOs/"

I then run rtorrent as root (for science, obviously) and it picks up on existing and new torrent files in the source folders, then downloads to the relevant directory. If you delete a torrent in any watch folder, it automatically stops running the torrent (closed) but does not delete the data in this configuration. If after you delete the torrent you put the exact same one back, it restarts it and picks up that the data is already there.

This is strictly the CLI rtorrent tool, this does not touch webgui stuff like rutorrent, but that part should not be too hard after this doozie. </TEXT>

<TITLE> EBGames (Gamestop) wants to charge me to circumvent the front of the line at midnight releases. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-11-21 02:06:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I placed $5 down on Mario World 3D coming out Friday. Dude from EBgames calls me to notify me that I could come in Thursday night for the midnight release.

Then he begins to try to upsell me to the Platinum Edge card for $15/yr, and talks about the benefits, and I don't care but then I hear something I do care about.

If I have the Platinum Edge card I can circumvent any lineup at midnight releases.

So, hold on a minute, I back up and clarify on this. If I wait 6 hours or so in line for a midnight release, that doesn't matter? Any other douche that happens to pay more gets in front of me no matter what?

Turns out, this is true.

This is fucking stupid, I told the guy this was stupid and that I've stood in line for every single CE that Blizzard has made, and been front of the line. This directly impacts me, and I shouldn't have to pay to ensure front of the line status.

Some may say, "1st world problems" or "quit whining" or  "you're the 1%", but why should anyone who legitimately stands in line be marginalized by someone who pays $15/yr? Who's the real fan here?

EBgames is now losing my business.

Just a heads up to anyone who plans to stand in line in the future at EBgames or Gamestop. Your place in line no longer matters to them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm training two cats to use the toilet with the Litter Kwitter. We're at the point where they're using it on the toilet with the first hole.

Now, they're defecating in the hole and on the kwitter just fine, but they've recently started urinating on the floor beside the toilet. I haven't seen urine make it into the toilet or the inner plastic the last while.

I've tried cleaning up the area beside the toilet and trying to mask the smell of the urine. But It's not yet working.

Ideas? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Public Mumble server (VoIP/Voice) - Gaming or not </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-23 23:05:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey Folks,

Just letting it be known again that we/me (LANified!) run a public Mumble server. Lots of people use it for gaming, but you're welcome to use it for whatever you want.

Address: voice.lanified.com
Port: Default (64738)

All I ask is that if you are playing a game to do it in the relevant channel, so others can join you.

If you want a channel made, just let me know and we can get it figured out.

We don't limit who uses the server unless they cause problems. So this isn't region limited either.

Have fun!

p.s. if you don't know what Mumble is, it's a voice application to chat with people. You can download your client at: http://mumble.sourceforge.net/ </TEXT>

<TITLE> frustration due to gmail features </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-11 19:17:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a frustration, and you may not guess what it is in advance. My frustration is that gmail allows the sending/receiving of files larger than 10MB.

Why is this frustrating to me?

Because this makes it harder for my users to understand why our mailserver only allows 10MB attachments and that I will not change it.

My understanding is that it's a bad idea to increase it past 10MB because other mail servers will just reject the email anyways as it is larger than the general acceptable mail size.

Am I antiquated? I don't know. But I sure am frustrated. I know of at least one user who is frustrated with me, just because I'm doing my job, but they don't know that. :/ </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm using Ubuntu in Unity. With Chromium or Firefox I log into our Zimbra webmail, and try to attach a file two ways. The file is on a network samba share.

1) I click the attach button in the web gui, and try to browse or manually go to smb://hostname and cannot actually reach the host (or figure out how). Failure.

2) I go to the file tool in the environment, successfully browse to smb://hostname, locate the file, and then try to drag it onto the attach field. Fails.

The only way it works in either case is I have to copy the file locally then do it. The local file works for both methods.

I'm uncertain what component is causing this as the experience is for both Chromium and Firefox. Ideas? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Tip - fitting Zimbra OSE in 2GB of RAM </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-16 16:36:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For those considering Zimbra OSE here's a tip that has worked out for me.

First off, some back story so you understand why this is necessary. In December 2012 I was looking to set up Zimbra for one of my side projects. The documentation says that it should operate in 2GB of RAM fine, but a lot of other guides/sources of info recommend 4GB. Zimbra installs and seems to run alright in 2GB but various modules randomly stop for no apparent reason. So I tried this:

My tip is simple. Setup a 2GB Swap file and activate it, then add it to fstab.

First, find a good place you want to keep your 2GB file, some place it wont be deleted, but if it is deleted it's not the end of the world as it was just temporary info anyways. I used /swap

* dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap/swapfile1 bs=1024 count=2097152

Note - The odd count number is to produce a 2GB file, but as long as you are larger than 2GB the precision on this number is not that important. It is also safe to use /dev/zero, you don't need /dev/random for if=.

* mkswap /swap/swapfile1

This formats the file for swap use.

* chown root:root /swap/swapfile1

* chmod 0600 /swap/swapfile1

Need to make sure permissions are set properly. Adjust this detail to your environment.

* swapon /swap/swapfile1

Activate the swap file right now

Then add the following line to /etc/fstab

* /swap/swapfile1 swap swap defaults 0 0

Parse it as you see fit, adjusting /swap/swapfile1 to the location and file name you actually used.

And that's it! </TEXT>

<TITLE> SAMBA4 Kerberos issue, ideas? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-15 15:48:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm stuck setting up my SAMBA4 PDC.

I'm running Ubuntu Server 13.04 in a VM. The static interface is set to point DNS to itself. /etc/hosts resolves domain.local (placeholder) to itself, as well as the member hostname it holds.

I've installed the necessary packages with this string:

apt-get install samba4 ntp krb5-user samba4-clients cups

During package installation I feed kerberos domain.local and tell SAMBA to not setup a domain. After installation is done I nuke /etc/samba/smb.conf and /etc/krb.conf .

I then provision using "/usr/bin/samba-tool domain provision" and follow the interactive options. I've tried internal and BIND9 DNS resolution (I'd prefer to use internal). I've used "DNS forward" to it's own IP or just "no".

I add the following to my new smb.conf file under the [global] section:

passdb backend = samba4

server services = +smb -s3fs

"smbclient -L localhost -U%" does populate with IPC/netlogon/sysvol, as expected

Then my krb5.conf looks like this

[libdefaults]

default_realm = domain.local

dns_lookup_realm = false

dns_lookup_kdc = true


Now onto the actual problem, the test right after this:

kinit administrator@DOMAIN.LOCAL

produces:

**kinit: Cannot resolve servers for KDC in realm "DOMAIN.LOCAL" while getting initial credentials**


I have tried quite a few things (some outlined above) and I am stumped. I ping DOMAIN.LOCAL and it resolves and responds to pings, so I don't know why KDC is having such an issue. I'm following multiple guides on SAMBA4 provisioning and this issue is not covered.

Ideas? </TEXT>

<TITLE> SAMBA4 sysvol replication across multiple domain controllers </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-11 01:49:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm in the process of setting up SAMBA4 as our PDC and a second one for a BDC (Primary Domain Controller and Back-up Domain Controller).

One of the things I keep seeing is that the sysvol does not inherently replicate in current versions of SAMBA4 (4.0.0-4.0.8 I'm assuming).

The SAMBA4 official documentation suggests that rsync is one way that can work. But I was wondering if anyone has any relevant experience on replicating sysvol in this or similar scenarios?

If you can speak on this matter, please outline the following information too:

* OS Distribution and version

* SAMBA4 version

* How many domain controllers you have for said domain

For those unfamiliar with SAMBA4, or Active Directory Domains, sysvol is a required element which houses many things but primarily is used for logon scripts and policies. Replication across domain controllers is vital especially in a fail-over scenario (which is what this post is about).

**my idea:** I was thinking of having sysvol be a NFS share on another system so it inherently replicates data to all nodes; of course mounted on boot before smbd starts. Is this an erroneous idea? Maybe having it rely on an external share might be a bad idea. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Portable Air Conditioner, replacement tubing, where to buy in Canada? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-03 01:15:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I bought a standing "portable" Air Conditioner many years ago, and over multiple moves since then I have since lost the included plastic tubing. The thing that made the tubing great was that it fit, and did not require duct tape to exhaust the heat.

As a result I've had to make many failed attempts to exhaust the hot air, primarily thin ducting using duct tape, but the duct tape's glue always melts and stops working.

I have not had any luck finding a replacement, so I was wondering if anyone knew of a good solution or source on such an item?

It's 37oc here in Calgary, save me! </TEXT>

<TITLE> NFS vs iSCSI, fight! (your thoughts on performance) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-06-27 18:06:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It was recently postulated to me that I should explore using NFS instead of iSCSI for space for my VM disks as it would result in better performance.

I have not yet been successful at finding conclusive results in either direction on this matter, so I think it would be helpful if we could hear from what people have experienced on this matter.

So for the various purposes, including hosting VM disks, which do you find to have better performance, iSCSI or NFS? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Shaw business pricing 50mbit plan, wtf guys? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-06-27 07:24:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay so leading up to the 50mbit plan the pricing is reasonable, then it just goes bananas.

(multipliers are relative to 50mbit plan)

$105 - 50mbit down - 5 mbit up --- 1.0x down speed - 1.0x up speed - 1.0x price

$260 - 100mbit down - 5mbit up --- 2.0x down speed - 1.0x up speed - 2.48x price

$360 - 259mbit down - 15mbit up --- 5.0x down speed - 3.0x up speed - 3.43x price

Almost all businesses don't care about getting that much down speed, more up speed. I've never heard of the price ratios being like this. Normally when you buy more bandwidth they give you a **better** price per mbit, not a worse one.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We have a Promise VTrak M300i. No, I didn't recommend we purchase it.

It has two NICs used strictly for iSCSI traffic, and a third port for management. We had one system connected directly into one of the ports for a dedicated connection. Last night I plugged that system into a VLAN which connects to the other iSCSI port on the same device, and it worked without any reconfiguration on either the Promise or the client server (fortunately same IP range on both ports).

So that got me thinking, what would happen if I plugged both iSCSI ports into the same LAN?

I haven't found any bonding features just yet, and this is a production storage device so I'm not actually going to do it, but I am curious about what would really happen.

Thoughts? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-06-05 17:53:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> No, I don't work for Intel, I just want to know. If you would be so kind as to talk about what you do know I'm sure others would appreciate it too.

1) Have you implemented vPro in your environment in any meaningful way?

2a) If no, why not?

2b) If yes, for what purpose?

3) If yes, has it been worth it? Why?

For those unfamiliar with vPro it is an Intel only chipset featureset which enables you OOB management in many ways for desktops. The earlier versions were a little light weight in features, but recent versions include things like onboard VNC servers (licensing uncertain). Unfortunately I do not know of an AMD camp equivalent. </TEXT>
