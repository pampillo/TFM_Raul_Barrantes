<TEXT> There is a lot of dialogue I'm reading here that concerns me. Specifically, the dialogue maintaining the "us vs them" mentality between the Democrats and the Republicans.

Lets be clear, neither side is "evil" and no one has everything right. Both sides have perspectives and backgrounds from which they hail. Granted, I'm a Democrat but that doesn't mean that my Republican friends are awful, and that I disagree with everything that they think.

Lets keep civil heads on our shoulders, and avoid the "us vs them" mentality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm brand new to investing but have no real idea of where to even start. I make enough currently to have an extra $200/month I would like to start investing. First I suppose I'll answer all the questions above:

I'm 31 Years Old
I'm employed full time and make $25k/yr with a VA Stipend of $834/month.
I would like to build retirement savings.
My risk tolerance would be roughly 50/50.
I have no holdings currently.
My only asset would be my vehicle valued at about $4k.
My time horizon would be needing the money in the next 15-20 years.
I am still working off some debts (Yes I realize that paying off all existing debts comes first).
No other relevant financial information that I can think of.

Any advice on where to start or even things to read to educate myself on how to invest intelligently would be fantastic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only problem is that there is a large portion of the LoL community that plays nothing but normals, so for them that is the game.  So on the flip side of this when people who play a lot of ranked come into a normal game and just screw around with the reasoning of "its just a normal" it can piss a lot of people off.  

Focusing on winning is the goal of any game, fun is the effect you're after as a result of playing the game.  If you were to lose all your games in normal, you wouldn't be having fun I can almost guarantee. </TEXT>

Purpose [edit]

The cosplayer's purpose may generally be sorted into one of three categories, or a combination of the three. Most cosplayers draw characteristics from all three categories:
The first is to express adoration for a character, or in feeling similar to a character in personality, seeking to become that character. This type of cosplayer may be associated with being a fan and is often labeled as an otaku. Other characteristics may be an enthusiastic manner and less attention to detail and quality. Such cosplayers are also most likely to adopt the character's personality and are known to criticise other cosplayers for not having a full knowledge of their character, or not also adopting character mannerisms.

The second is those people who enjoy the attention that cosplaying a certain character brings. Within the cultures of anime and manga specifically, as well as science fiction and fantasy, there is a certain level of notoriety that is attached to cosplayers. Such cosplayers are usually characterised by attention to detail in their garments and their choice of popular characters. They are also noted by participation in cosplay competitions.

The third is those who enjoy the creative process, and the sense of personal achievement upon completion. Such people are more likely to have a greater budget dedicated to the project, more complicated and better quality outfits with access to more materials. They are also more likely to engage with professional photographers and cosplay photographers to take high quality images of the cosplayer in their garment posing as the character. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Ideas for giving a friend some money anonymously? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-05-03 17:33:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I have a friend who is going through some really really hard times right now, but is too proud to ask for/accept help from any of his friends.  I was thinking of anonymously gifting him a little bit of cash (around $100) to help him through the next couple of weeks.  Any ideas on how to do this?

EDIT: Great ideas so far, keep them coming!

EDIT2:  I'm seriously confused as to who down votes legitimate questions like this...

EDIT3:  Thank you all for the ideas, there were a lot of great ones, and a few bad ones.  I've decided that I'll try just being straight up and talking to him about the gift. </TEXT>

I am a full time employee with the State and I've just recently gone back to school full time to finish out my undergraduate degree that I failed to get before enlisting in the USAF.  Being that I have absolutely no free time and am constantly busy the small acts of kindness this sub has shown me brightens my day and makes me smile.

So thank you RAoA!  You are all awesome! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I have a slight fixation on finding as many grumpy cat pictures as possible (which I use as my facebook profile picture).  

The contest is simple, find me what you think is the best grumpy cat picture and I will select 3 random individuals who post to gift!

Let the best grumpy cat win!

EDIT:  Contest has ended I am selecting winners now, sorry for the delay I was at work!

EDIT:  Congratz to jemiglio, xX_Justin_Xx, and watsoned!  Thank you all for the awesome submissions I now have a lot of pictures to use hehe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So far I have managed to carry myself from Silver III to Silver I using nothing but GP Top.  My build is Philo Stone - Boots I - Avarice Blade - Boots II - Statikk Shiv - Icebourne Gauntlet - Warmogs - BotRK 

Using this its almost impossible to be countered in lane as if you can't win the harass war you just farm with Parley combined with GP10 items and quints and you still farm money.  Even if the enemy stacks armor against you in lane generally by the time I make it to my Statikk Shiv they underestimate that 100 magic dmg that it procs.

In most cases so far by mid game I'm a terror that peels well, ults all over the map as needed, and can rush through a team to the carry or soak large amounts of dmg for the team.

This is simply how I've been playing him and its worked for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel for you silverblaze92!  Until recently (just over 2 months now) I was single and had been for over 3 years after I filed for divorce.  

I met my current SO through a mutual friend and we all went to see Skyfall together.  Being the oblivious and socially inept individual I am I failed to notice the signs and didn't even ask for her number after the movie.  My friend being a bit more perceptive, called me the next day and said, "Here's her number, you should call her". The rest, as they say, is history.

I know how hard it is to put yourself out there so upvotes to you sir for making the effort! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was a Methodist while I was growing up, but over time lost my faith in any organized religion.  Before massive amounts of information and peers were available via the internet I had to figure out where I stood on this subject on my own.  I'm sure a lot of people can relate to this and it being a bit more difficult to figure out one's faith before the "nets".

I'm respectful of anyone's religion (SO is a devout Catholic) the only thing I ever ask is to be respectful of my beliefs(or lack thereof) and not try and shove it down my throat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The last series of books that I read was the Kane Chronicles by Rick Riordan.  Honestly, I was a bit skeptical of his writing seeing as its meant for young adults but I found that I really enjoyed the stories and the way he managed to meld in mythology with fiction.  I highly recommend them! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did notice that and your math is quite solid.  My only question would be to see the same math done with levels of AP beyond 200.  200 AP is more of a mid game level and you're wrong that enemy resistance always increases as the game continues.  At lv 16-18 end game most players won't have built much if any resistance or will just be getting to their singular defensive item if they're not a tank.  AP levels will also be much higher than the calculated 200AP.  

Please don't misunderstand I'm not saying you're wrong, and as you saw in my last reply I will be using void staff in all early/mid game situations based on this post :-D. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm still on the fence about the early elo gain/losses.  Its taken me almost a month to work my way back up to almost 1400 after having a rough string of matches in which I had a troll or leaver ruin my game.

I suppose the reasoning for the huge losses and gains it to quickly assess what level play you should be at.  If you get completely stomped in one game it drops you down quickly to try and better match you, while if you dominate your next one it jumps you up a bit to again try and match you appropriately. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Must like what a lot of the people here have already said, Teemo is mainly a counter to certain champions.  However, this said, he can be a solid carry from low elo (1200 to around 1400) due to his ability to very effectively split push and provide map awareness through shrooms.

The S3 items also lend themselves quite well to this giving him the ability to not only bully but completely dominate his lane in early/mid game.  Malady, Liandris, and Void Staff give him the punch to make many champions think twice about engaging him and add his already high base speed with flash and he can escape most ganks.

TL;DR: Teemo is mainly a counter champ, but can carry from low to mid elo with split push.

<TEXT> Correct me if I'm wrong but wouldn't these calculations only hold true at early/early mid game AP levels?  Being that DC is a % based increase to AP wouldn't higher end game levels bear different numbers based on having over 400AP through itemization? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm here to say two things.  First you seem like an incredibly awesome individual (4 languages excluding English??? WOW!).  Second, there is some debate over whether larger cats can purr since we don't know exactly what the mechanism is when cats purr.  

Generally though larger cats "chuff" or friendly growl instead of the standard purr noise.  Some scientists have theorized that the larger cats would be purring but due to their size it comes out as a "chuff" instead.

<TEXT> I am a Korean adopted male with an adopted younger sister, and while growing up I don't ever remember her dating an Asian guy.  Honestly I still don't think she has ever dated an Asian guy, she is always with a white male.

My sister is not racist in any way, shape or form, but I've always wondered why she's never dated another Asian.  Part of the reason may be that we grew up in Montana where the population of Asians is smaller at best, but when she went to Hawaii for college, she still never did.

I've never asked her what the reason for this might be, but perhaps I will now this post has me thinking about it. </TEXT>

I left college in my junior year to enlist in the USAF and spent four years having a great time.  Upon separation in 2010 I moved back to my hometown for financial and family support reasons.  Now that I'm back I've been disgusted and disappointed with trying to meet/date people here.

I'm not necessarily looking for a relationship, but I'm open to wherever things lead to.  Don't care how far away you are (accents are awesome) PM if you're interested in chatting! </TEXT>

I will definitely ask about the valves and how longs its been sitting.  He mentioned that he was holding onto it for his fiancee but she has no interest in riding.

I also just found another bike of interest, a 99 Ninja 250r.  He's asking 1900 and I know that's a bit high.  Bike has never been tipped, and the picture looks fairly good.  Any thoughts on what a good counter offer would be? </TEXT>
