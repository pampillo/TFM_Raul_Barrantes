<TEXT> It seems as though trials lag has gotten worse. I just played 4 rounds of trials where capping the point simply didn't do anything. It stayed at 100% with no enemies on it and it wouldn't allow us to cap it. People are lagging everywhere and this so called "latency matchmaking" accomplishes nothing, people are rubber banding across the map. Other times we are getting unable to revive bugs. It is starting to cost players games for no reason beyond the game breaking. We are telling people to be careful with your passage coins this run through, it seems as though Trials isn't working as it should. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People can have different opinions, that isn't my issue with all this. It's the things people are saying that are objectively not true.

Good writing? Tons of content? It has about the same amount of "stuff" as TDB, and this writing is.... so bad...

I guess the point I'm making is people are accepting a slightly nicer TDB as this great thing, and that worries me, since it feeds into what makes the game feel like a grind. Then again it's just my opinion :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> I can't be the only one who finds this DLC.... underwhelming... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-21 20:50:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Perhaps I'm just too jaded, but it seems like everyone is too caught up on how much **better** it is than TDB. Few people seem to be examining the DLC as a stand alone piece.

Let's be honest, everything is shiny now, but in 2 or 3 weeks PoE will feel very stale. Even with all the new modifiers, the game hasn't grown mechanically beyond the scorch cannons and web grenade stuff. 

Where are the new monsters? New Grenade subtypes? New Crucible or PVP events beyond Trials of Osiris (Mini crucible... yaaaay.....) New supers? BETTER WRITING? ("He's pulling the entire house of wolves through time and space!" Really?) 1 new strike, which is pretty much the same as Sepiks prime but with the Archon Priest as a boss?

I dunno, I feel burnt out by how much mediocrity the community accepts as fantastic when we should be dissecting everything wrong with the game and not get too caught up on the hype. It's the only way the game gets better, but everyone seems to think this is the second coming of RNGesus.

Just keep an objective head guys, all I'm sayin </TEXT>

<TEXT> It basically boils down to risk/reward with respect to kill output. Rocket launchers are low risk/low reward with respect to the number of kills you can get, generally 1 per rocket. LMGS are high risk/high reward since they require a riskier play-style to maximize, but can generate much more kills as a result (upwards of 10 or more with the right set of circumstances). After loads of pvp, I tend to switch around to whatever fits my mood. Since the changes to heavy ammo Rocket launchers aren't nearly as insane as before so it feels more balanced out.

I do tend to sometimes think "Just fuck it, I ain't changing shit," but at the end of the day, I feel like if I don't stand on principle for SOMETHING then I simply am feeding into the global mentality of "Eh, as long as it doesn't affect me." It is hard as HELL to avoid Nestle and everything they own, but making the effort makes me feel mildly better as a person. Gotta take the little victories I suppose.

The company has always been a horribly exploitative one, and I avoid their products at all costs. There's an interesting documentary about how children are trafficked into plantations to work the cocoa beans that are sold to companies like Nestle.
