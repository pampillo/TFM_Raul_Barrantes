<TEXT> I'm confused as to why you reviewed the sound design of Cave Story+ instead of looking at the original Cave Story?

Also at the end you mention that Cave Story came out in 2004 but the game you reviewed, Cave Story+, came out in 2011. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a process involved. The judge blocked the order but the DOJ appealed. There will be a hearing on May 15 to see if the block should be upheld. The DOJ (or the other party) can keep appealing up until the case reaches the Supreme Court. The court can then decide if they want to take the case or they can let a lower decision stand.

Does that process seem fine to you? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't want to romanticize illegals but you do have to admit they are human. Immigrants come to the US for a better life. They want to provide for their families, they want better opportunities. What other reasons would they risk coming here for? That, however, doesn't mean I don't also want sensible immigration laws. It took my parents over 10 years to get a green card. They became citizens less than 5 years after they got their cards though. I think it should be easier to immigrate to the US. I think waiting many many years is ridiculous.

As for illegal immigrants that are already here I do think it's fair to punish them but I don't think the solution is deportation then reapplying. I think a fine would suffice, fine them and get them into the system. Stop worrying about them and then focus on making immigration easier.

I think that is where we will disagree. I want easier immigration. You probably want less immigration. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They all mean different things. The post has a very good explanation on what they mean. Personally I think we all should just use the base 2 version (mebibyte, gibibyte, etc.) because computers are binary. Underneath all the marketing bullshit they still work using base 2 (or base 8 or base 16) but not base 10. Note that when you buy RAM they list things in gigabytes not gibibytes. Try going into dxdiag and looking at how much memory is reported. 8 GiB of RAM is reported as 8,192 MiB. If you got 8 GB of RAM then Windows would report it as ~7,629 MiB of RAM.

I think this is confusing because marketing people wanted to make it confusing to the average consumer. Computers will always work in base 2. I think it's easier to explain that 8 GB is actually 8,192 MB instead of explaining mega vs mebi. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lisa was at the supermarket in the pets aisle looking for a new toy for Lisa. She decided on a new toy when she saw Norman looking at cat food. Lisa put the toy in her basket and turned towards Norman.

Hi Norman she said. Norman turned around. Hi Lisa, how are you doing? he asked.

I am doing well. I was just picking out a new toy for Lisa, she replied. Well I am sure Lisa will like it, said Norman. Lisa then remembered CSI would be on soon. Yes, actually I have to get going, she said. OK, see you at work tomorrow, said Norman. Norman walked further into the aisle.

Lisa wanted to get a small carton of eggs but she would have to walk past Norman again to get to them in the back of the store. She did not know if she should say hi to Norman again so she decided to head to the register. She could have cereal tomorrow morning instead. She liked cereal.

As the cashier scanned the bone she thought to herself, *Maybe tomorrow I can tell Norman how much Lisa liked the bone.*

<TEXT> Norman turned the corner to the pets aisle at the supermarket. Norman needed more cat food. As he entered the aisle he saw Lisa comparing items. Norman thought Lisa looked busy so he didnt say hi and looked at the shelf to find the cat food brand Norman liked.

Just as he found the bag he heard Hi Norman from behind him. He put the bag into his basket as he turned. It was Lisa. Hi Lisa, how are you doing? he asked her.

I am doing well. I was just picking out a new toy for Lisa, she replied. Norman looked at Lisas basket, there was a plastic dog bone sitting at the top. Well I am sure Lisa will like it, he said. Yes, actually I have to get going, said Lisa. OK, see you at work tomorrow, he said. Norman turned and walked further into the aisle. Norman thought about getting Norman a new toy but then he remembered CSI would be on soon.

*Maybe next time Norman* he thought to himself.

That is...incredibly wrong. See here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_Service_System#Failure_to_register

 As an alternative method of encouraging or coercing registration, federal legislators passed laws requiring that to receive financial aid, federal grants and loans, certain government benefits, eligibility for most federal employment, and (if the person is an immigrant) eligibility for citizenship.

It then goes on to state that some states mandate you register to get some state benefits (like a driver's license) but nowhere does it say you don't get the right to vote until you register. Nowhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> CS student here. Had a Surface Pro 1 since it launched (so almost 3 years at this point) and I bought a Surface Book with no dGPU at launch (128 GB 8 GB RAM). I'm happy I went with the Surface Book. I thought it would be a really hard decision to choose between a SP4 and the SB but the SB won out. One thing I don't miss from the SP1 is that with the SB I have the ability to use my laptop at weird angles, sitting in weird positions, or be able to type with the keyboard while sideways in bed (not practical at all but I still do it sometimes). My SP1 could do it but the keyboard would have to be at the right angle and I would have to provide way more support.

What I'm basically saying is that you will probably like either no matter what you do. What I think it really comes down to is if you really value having an actual laptop with a hinge vs having a detachable screen.

...I do miss the kickstand though, kind of wish the SB screen had a kickstand... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes? It's hard to compare the two since they exist in very different environments. Most would say Powershell isn't as good as bash. I also don't need to use Powershell on a day to day basis. When I use a Linux based operating system (usually doesn't happen too often) the things I use in bash the most are things like vim and debuggers. Windows is a GUI based system so there are GUI based solutions for things. Linux has more command line solutions for things. They both work well when they need to.

<TEXT> I've had ups and downs. The insider previews have certainly gotten better over the last couple of months. I rarely get bugs (maybe one app crash every couple days). Glance however doesn't work for me. It did work 2 builds ago but not it won't install for me. If you don't factory reset after upgrading to 10 you'll be fine because Glance will stay installed but it was always recommended to factory reset after an upgrade. Hopefully that won't be the case for the RTM build.

It's been at least 3 weeks since the last build came out so the RTM build should be very solid. I would say once 10586 comes out (RTM) try it out (since you probably won't have to wait that long for the build anyway). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Facebook reminded me today that I bought my 920 three years ago today. The 920 launched November 2, 2012 but it wasn't available in the US (on AT T) until the 11th (or 9th) of November. I was upgrading from a HTC Surround (WP7) and was super excited for this phone. My one regret was not waiting a week or so to pick up the cyan version (I have a black 920). The Microsoft store didn't have any in stock when I went to pick one up.

Still using the same 920 as my daily phone. It runs pretty well on Win10 but I'm really looking forward to the 950. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've owned a Surface Pro 1 since it launched (so almost 3 years). I really really love the device, I use it every single day. I'm currently a junior CS student in college. I haven't had to use a paper notebook since I bought the Surface, all of my notes have been hand written in OneNote. The pen is great for just jotting things down randomly or sketching out ideas. I can run Visual Studio on it, Linux (I had a Arch Linux USB boot for one of my classes), I bring it to hackathons and code on it (Python Flask apps?, front end web development?, Android app?, Surface can handle it all).

Went to the store today and preordered the Surface Book. I really couldn't decide between the Pro 4 and the Book because I've gotten so use to the tablet and kickstand that I thought I wouldn't really like the Book any more than the Pro 4 but the Book has a bigger trackpad and the screen really isn't that much bigger than the Pro 4 screen so I preordered a base model Book. Pretty excited to get my hands on it. </TEXT>

I guess one of the main improvements over the last mobile build I tried (which was I believe the second one that came out) is that the OS doesn't lockup anymore. I figure I'm running into issues because I have a really old phone but I'm still worried about them releasing Win 10 Mobile in this state. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe stories expire after 24 hours (not too sure, never used Snapchat since I've only owned Windows Phones). Regular snaps expire after a set period of time. I think that's why some people like it. Send a silly maybe slightly embarrassing photo, it gets "deleted" (since you can save snaps this is kind of pointless) after a couple seconds.

With the MMS thing nobody wants to spend time trying to fix it. If they need to talk to their carrier then that's at least 15 minutes trying to connect to the right person. Why fix something when you can just use something else that works? (In this case, Snapchat). </TEXT>

<TEXT> My T experience actually started Sunday night right after the Patriots game. Got into South Station and needed to take the last Fairmount train. Train was due to leave at 11:50. They announced the train was boarding on track 5 at 11:40. Walk onto the platform. Train is empty, no MBTA workers anywhere to be seen. There are 3 people (me and 2 others) waiting to get onto the train. We find that one of the doors is unlocked so we go into the train (this was at about 11:50). We wait on the train for 5 minutes when a conductor gets onto the train and says that the train we were on is actually a Worcester train and that the Fairmount train had been canceled for some reason. So we get off the train and walk to the information booth. Nobody working in the booth but there are two MBTA employees standing right next to it. We tell them what happened and they don't know why the train was canceled. She tells us to check the commuter rail ticket booth to see if anybody there has any information. It's midnight now so the booths are closed. We walk back and she makes a call and tells us that the train was canceled because nobody was going to take the train apparently. She then tells us to go up to the signal booth and talk to the guy there so that they can order us a taxi so we can get home. It took a while for the taxi to get there (we ended up going up to the booth a second time so that I could give them my number so the taxi driver could call me when they arrived). I got back home around 12:30.

Getting into work on Monday wasn't that bad. It was leaving work that was the problem. At around 4 PM I get a TAlert stating that the red line was experiencing severe delays due to a disabled train. Coupled with the fact that Fairmount trains were being delayed and canceled I decided to leave work immediately before I got stuck somewhere. I believe I got onto the last red line train that left Kendall/MIT towards South Station before the red line basically shutdown. Got onto the 4:25 Fairmount train at South Station that was delayed by 20-30 minutes. About a minute after we leave South Station the train stops apparently due to a signal issue. It took them about 20 minutes to fix the signal issue. My commute back home took about 90 minutes when it usually takes 30. I count myself lucky because I probably could have gotten stuck at Kendall/MIT for a while or would have to wait for a super delayed Fairmount train.

This morning at 7 AM I got a TAlert stating that the red line was experiencing severe delays again. I said fuck it and went back to bed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not just maybe. They do have something planned. The reason people are upset is because network quality has gone down over the last couple of patches. It may be due to more people playing League at this time of year but Riot hasn't said anything regarding the degradation in service. It may not even be Riot's fault (damn ISP's) but their silence about this is why people are upset. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I currently have 575 hours logged on Super Monday Night Combat. Was the first MOBA I played and I loved it. After most of the community left I moved over to League because most of my college friends played it but SMNC still will have a place in my heart. I even bought MNC on Steam when it was on sale one day to play it but I prefer the pace of SMNC (contrary to what most of the posts here say). I guess I like a more traditional MOBA. I heard that MNC had one hit kills and time to kill was faster. I feel like that makes it more frustrating for a new player to pick up the game. SMNC still was somewhat fast paced but it had somewhat of a laning phase or ramp up phase where you had to kill bots before you could start killing players just like in League or DotA.

If a SMNC kickstarter came out I would support it. I would rather the game stay closer to SMNC than MNC but it seems like more people like MNC's playstyle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> - Lucian's changes probably aren't considered a gameplay update (meaning he will be played in next week's LCS if the patch comes out on Wednesday)

- Sona's rework will probably be in 4.13 which is probably 2 weeks from now and she won't be available for 4 weeks after she is changed. (Probably available the 27th of August)

- Fiora's rework hasn't hit PBE yet. We have no idea how far along that is but it probably won't make it onto PBE until Sona is ready to be pushed to live. Earliest I can see it hit live is the 13th of August. It will count as a gameplay update so wont be available Sept 10th.

- Nobody knows how far along Sion is. If Sion hits live after Fiora (super optimistic) it will probably be around the 27th of August and won't be available till the 24th of September.

- Worlds starts some time in September with the final on October 19th. Last year's Worlds started on September 15th and lasted 19 days so if we go by that this years worlds will start on September 30th. The last major patch before Season 3 worlds seems to be 3.10a which happened on August 22nd which was 43 days before worlds. This would put that patch around September 6th for this year. Following the two week patch release schedule that patch would be 4.13 (July 30th) or 4.14 (August 13th) anything that hits in one of those two patches probably will be allowed (Lucian was allowed and he hit 3.10a) so following theoretical patch release cycle I put up only upto the Fiora gameplay rework would be allowed in the Worlds patch.

So to answer your question. Unless the team scrambles to put Lee Sin changes up onto PBE for 4.13/4.14 cycle he won't be in worlds. Sona has been worked on for a while. The first time we heard that Fiora was being updated was early April so Lee Sin changes now would probably suck for everybody involved. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are multiple champion designers/game designers that work on different champs. For example one designer worked on Rengar and Skarner, another worked on Lucian, one is currently working on Fiora, one worked on Xerath. It's usually one or two people who do the major thought process and design behind balancing a champion but they do get help from everybody else. I'm sure one designer doesn't get to sign off on the changes before the rest of the team sees it but I wouldn't be surprised if the teams trusted that one designer's thoughts. </TEXT>

PBE was getting prepped for live launch last week (they took out new SR and any other changes that would not be in 4.12, Lucian's changes were not removed). Also since they probably will not count this as a gameplay update he will be available next week in LCS. People will be able to get used to him for playoffs. </TEXT>

Feral Flare allowed you to farm jungle in high safety (compared to laners who always have to fight somebody else) and get just as much gold as a laner who has to deal with another person. Same with many other strong junglers. Farm in safety, gank and get a kill. Outscale somebody who has to lane against another champion, deal with ganks, and CS properly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have your math wrong. Currently if you crit you do 200% of your attack damage which you stated. What he is suggesting is that you do bonus damage equal to what your crit % would be now. So if you have 200 AD and 30% bonus damage (30% crit chance) you do 260 AD 200 + (200 * 0.3 = 60) = 260.

If you have 100% bonus damage (100% crit chance) and you have 200 AD you would do 200  + (200 * 1.0 = 200) = 400 which is exactly the same as it is currently. Remember it's bonus damage so that gets added onto your current AD. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was also suggested here: http://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/live-gameplay/hbEj1jWi-can-we-finally-phase-crits-rngesus-out-of-the-game

For anybody who doesn't understand how this would basically be the same as the crit we have now.

If you have 200 AD and 30% crit that means 30% of the time your auto attacks would do 200% damage. Meaning 30% of your AAs do 400 AD instead of 200 AD (we are ignoring any resistances/runes/masteries etc.). If you AA 10 times you would be expected to have 7 normal damage attacks and 3 crit damage attacks.

200 * 7 + 400 * 3 = 2600 damage dealt in 10 AAs

Now if you do 30% more damage on every auto attack instead of crit each of your auto attacks would do 260 AD instead of 200. Now over 10 AAs

260 * 10 = 2600 dealt in 10 AAs.

This is a good solution because it is exactly the same as crit except it smooths the curve out. You don't get lucky and have many crits in a row or unlucky with no crits (there is a modified RNG in the game so you shouldn't get periods of no crit at all). </TEXT>

 On one side, a case could be made that map-level objective awareness is a significant aspect of skill  and to that, we wholeheartedly agree. We would not, for example, alert you when an opponent entered your immediate radius from fog, nor would we ever track enemy cooldowns for you. Your interactions with your opponents are sacred and we will always leave those interactions alone.

I'm assuming enemy team summoner spells, skill, and ward timers fall under opponent interactions.

<TEXT> Violence is easy to explain to children. Don't do that. End of story. Sex is a little harder. You shouldn't have sex now but there comes a time when it's OK. When does that time come? How do they know it's OK?

Puberty is a whole mess of feelings and having sexual feelings towards other people is strange when before those feelings didn't even exit. It's a harder subject because it involves another persons agreement as well. Getting somebody to like you before you have sex is required.

Violence is simple. Don't punch your brother, don't kill your goldfish. But yes, the craziness about breasts is weird. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you are 20-0 in a game you are really good and/or the other team is really bad. The chance of you going 20-0 by luck is unlikely. If you are the ADC and you are 20-0 then yes you should be able to carry. If you are 20-0 and are the support and your ADC is struggling to kill people because you took most of the gold from kills then yes it is still your fault if you lose the game.

You could go 20-0 but not pressure any other lanes and only go for kills and the other team could catch up, get into late game, and beat your team. You can always find a way to blame yourself for a loss, realize what you did wrong, and try not to do it again. This is what qtpie is saying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The one thing with the failures that Microsoft has put out is usually that they learn from their mistakes. Zune actually was a pretty good device, it just had to compete with the iPod which dominated the MP3 device market. A lot of ideas from Zune helped shape what Windows Phone is now. Microsoft actually took a big risk with Windows Phone because they basically started from scratch on Windows Phone 7 when they dropped Windows Mobile 6.5. Windows Phone isn't doing as great as they hope probably but it is slowly growing. It's now seen as the third major mobile phone OS.

Hopefully Microsoft does more things like Windows Phone, Surface (yeah Surface RT was shit but the Pro is amazing), and Xbox One. We will have to see how Xbox One pans out but I have a feeling they won't fuck it up too badly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your opinion is really interesting. I can see why kids are a lasting mark on Earth. All things do come to an end, even humanity itself will, probably, come to an end. Having a lineage is one way though to continue a lasting mark on Earth. You can still make a lasting mark on Earth by not having kids though. Inventions that have changed the way the world works have lasting marks generation through generation, the elimination of diseases is a big one. The group of people that help eliminate cancer will probably be remembered though the end of humanity.

On the other hand what if you don't want to have a lasting mark on the world? Helping somebody down on their luck or loving someone and being with them is still a great thing to do. And even if people die and nations fall you still changed somebody's life for the better. Nobody knows the true meaning of life, there is no real endgoal, everything comes to an end whether it be 50 years from now or millions of years later. </TEXT>

It seems like to you part of "growing up and taking responsibility" is having kids. What about owning a business or helping people less fortunate than you. Studying and progressing the human race. These are all great things but if you don't have kids that makes you irresponsible?

What about caring for and for providing for your significant other? Being there for somebody else in this world no matter what you two go through is probably one of the most noble things somebody can do. But apparently having kids makes you not responsible... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I made a tiny little app that can open Twitch streams in VLC. It only works on Windows. You must have VLC installed. If you don't have VLC installed in the default location you can browse to where it is installed and still use this app. It isn't heavily tested so if stuff breaks I can't help you.

It uses the [Twitch API](https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API) and a [C# library](https://github.com/subject4635/Twixel) for the Twitch API I wrote.

<TEXT> The end of season 2 changes worked in the fact that ADC's aren't the only massively damaging thing on a team. Other members of the team matter now and they can deal damage. However I feel that in season 2 since the ADC was the most important role that teams would do anything to defend/peel for their ADC. Now ADC doesn't do all the team's damage so teams can decide to try to burst down the APC/assassin/ADC.

The thing that annoys me the most is that a second of CC on an ADC can spell death for them no matter how well they play a teamfight. In return ADC's don't do that much damage for how weak they are now. I don't think Riot wants to return to the strength of season 2 ADC's and I think buffing ADC's survivability would be much healthier for the game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think one of reasons that AS isn't the greatest on Vayne is because damage is also pretty good on her. Her Q does 50% of her bonus AD at level 5 and her R gives her 55 bonus AD. With a lot of AD and armor pen she can cut through targets. Mid season 3 people also realized that you can build her with with AS in mind and use her W with true damage to cut through targets.

Like you said Lucian, Jinx, and Sivir don't need to build AS because they get it for free. They only have one reliable build path while other ADC's like Vayne, Cait, and Varus have to decide between AS or AD weighted builds. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can also try out Yasuo in normal games. I don't think its fair to call people who ban Yasuo trolls because banning him gives Riot valuable information. If Yasuo is banned in a large majority of games they would ask themselves why and see if he needs some more balance tweaks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think one of the reasons double gold item made it through was that they also tested pre season changes with pros first and got a lot of feedback there. I think Riot trusted the pros more than PBE and that's why they weren't too worried about the item until it saw massive abuse on the live servers. Realize that the number of pros they could have tested the changes on is a small number and that the PBE server also has a small number of people. Also the whole point of preseason is to test new changes before the new season comes in so major imbalances don't affect the real season. </TEXT>

They have some changes to the 3 year fears (Fiddle and Rammus) that are going to be tested at some point. It isn't just bugs that are tested on PBE. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like bug quotas isn't the greatest of ideas because even though PBE does find bugs it isn't like the game is riddled with bugs. Most every patch goes though QA I believe before it's put onto PBE so most things people suggest on PBE are item and champ balances rather than bugs. It's really only the new stuff that have bugs in them and those only come out every once in a while. </TEXT>

There are a lot of people that dodge in like the first week after the new champ comes out but not often anymore since its been a couple weeks now. There are a lot of idiots and assholes on PBE though which is really annoying though. The people you do call out for trolling say that they wont get banned cause its PBE. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They also test regular queue stuff in PBE. Recently Team Builder (which is a mode on top of 5v5 Normal SR) was being tested. PBE is also testing the 1v1 and 2v2 modes. Also a massive bug was just found where minions that hit inhibitors would crash the game. This bug would not have been found if SR wasn't available. I also feel like people are somewhat more dedicated to a matchmaking game than a custom game. If PBE was limited to customs only I would think the amount of leavers and AFK's would shoot through the roof. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hate Operation Locker but loved Operation Metro 8v8 rush. That was the only mode where the map was great. 8v8 your team has to work together or you lose. There are enough people and the map is small enough to feel like there is always action but there are few enough people where flanking is possible. I never understood why people enjoyed 64v64 spam fests on conquest on that map because there the map sucks. The map however excels at smaller infantry style combat.

I feel like I would enjoy Locker a bit more if it was played with lower player counts (and wasn't always on conquest large) but it seems like most servers keep the player counts high because that's "the battlefield way". Battlefield is great at large combat but BF3 and BF4 have really improved on its smaller map infantry based engagements without it feeling like a game of COD (conquest and rush mainly). </TEXT>

<TEXT> They last time they bandaided a champion it was Olaf. Look what happened to him. When Voyboy did really well with Olaf Riot said "we have to nerf this" ant just went with a quick easy fix without carefully looking at the impact of those changes.

Now they've learned and take their time when doing large buffs or nerfs on champs. Riot has been mulling over Rengar changes for months they just haven't said anything major till now. Jayce is getting big changes to reduce his power probably next patch but they are asking for a lot of feedback on the PBE forums on how to go about it. Xerath is getting reworked because hes supposed to be a powerful burst mage but nobody plays him but they are carefully taking the time to fix him instead of over buffing him and calling it a day. They are fixing Yorick and they are always asking for feedback on what his new kits should look like. Riot isn't stupid. It just looks like they take a while to change things because they iterate heavily internally without any announcements and then when they are closer to completion they ask for input from the community. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I redid my damage calculations for Master Yi's damage output (x-post /r/leagueoflegends) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-05 01:45:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In my first set of calculations I didn't account for crit change or Shiv's damage so the numbers were off. Also the targets I used were at a lower point than what a full build target would be at. So this time around crits are calculated across the board. On Yi's AA damage, on his Q damage, and on his Shiv magic damage. I also used two different kinds of runes on him. AD reds and Armor Pen reds. [I also used 21 points in the Offensive tree.](http://i.imgur.com/ymEwi3I.png) I included 2% damage from all sources (except true damage), Frenzy's bonus attack speed, and 5% more damage to targets under 50% health from Executioner. The builds however were the same from last time.

Berserker's Greaves, Youmuu's Ghostblade (active), Infinity Edge, Bloodthirster, Phantom Dancer, Last Whisper  
Berserker's Greaves, Youmuu's Ghostblade (active), Infinity Edge, Bloodthirster, Statikk Shiv, Last Whisper  
Berserker's Greaves, Youmuu's Ghostblade (active), Infinity Edge, Blade of the Ruined King, Phantom Dancer, Last Whisper  
Berserker's Greaves, Youmuu's Ghostblade (active), Infinity Edge, Blade of the Ruined King, Statikk Shiv, Last Whisper

For targets I now used 3 full build targets. A very squishy champ, the tankiest ADC, and a tank. All these targets also used magic resist per level blues and armor yellows. For the squishy target I chose Zyra who had Liandry's Torment and Zhonya's Hourglass as health and defensive items with [9 points in the defensive mastery tree.](http://i.imgur.com/cvpQB5J.png) Her health, armor, and magic resist at level 18 were 2125, 133, and 56 respectively.

For the tankiest ADC I used Graves who had his passive fully stacked and had either Guardian's Angel or Randuin's Omen as a defensive item. He also had [9 points in the defensive mastery tree.](http://i.imgur.com/cvpQB5J.png) His health, armor, and magic resist at level 18 were 2060, 170.6, and 102 for GA and 2560, 190.6, and 62 for Randuin's.

For the tank target I chose Shen with Armor boots, Sunfire Cape, Locket of the Iron Solari, Spirit Visage, Trinity Force, and either Warmog's or Randuin's as his last item. He also had [22 points in the defensive mastery tree.](http://i.imgur.com/ac0uF6W.png) I did apply the 2 less damage from all sources (except for true damage), 3 less damage from all AA's, 10% less crit damage from all sources (this includes Master Yi's Q), and 3% less damage from all sources (except for true damage). Shen's health, armor, and magic resist at level 18 were 4675.84, 170.6, and 113.475 with Warmog's and 4155.84, 261.3, and 113.475 with Randuin's.

When calculating the damage from items, actives, passives and whatever else was there I did include Q's damage, BotRK's active damage, and Shiv's damage all the time if applicable. However for Q and Shiv I did two separate calculations for if they did or did not crit since you Q once at the beginning before you auto attack them and since Shiv only procced once during all the fights (Yes, everybody died in under 10 auto attacks).

After all that pre-explanation here is all the data I collected: http://sdrv.ms/12QhWBB

**TL;DR:** If you want to kill a lower health/armor target go BotRK with either PD or Shiv with Armor Pen reds. If you want to kill a tanky ADC without Randuin's go BotRK with either PD or Shiv. Reds don't matter here. However if the ADC has Randuin's go BT with PD and Armor Pen reds but only if your Q crits. If your Q doesn't crit then go BotRK with PD. If you want to kill a tank with or without Randuin's go BotRK with PD and Armor Pen reds.

**TL;DR of the TL;DR: Run BotRK, PD, and Armor Pen reds on Yi.**

Now here are the results:

**KEY:**  
BRK = Blade of the Ruined King  
BT = Bloodthirster  
PD = Phantom Dancer  
Shiv = Statikk Shiv  
AD = Attack Damage Reds  
AR = Armor Pen Reds

Remember Q and any actives are applied first before auto attacks.

<TEXT> Also I got a question last post asking if Longsword, 2 potions is worth it over Hunter's Machete, 5 potions starting in the jungle. I tried it out and Machete clears faster with a time of [3:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exq5_28a_OM) over [3:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfvPu0uGT4I). I used these [runes](http://i.imgur.com/H8yXqY8.jpg) and [masteries](http://i.imgur.com/mnVCqlp.jpg). However Longsword, 2 potions builds into Youmuu's Ghostblade faster. Also this couldn't fit in the post because I ran into the character limit :S </TEXT>

<TITLE> I redid my damage calculations for Master Yi's damage output </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-04 07:34:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In my first set of calculations I didn't account for crit change or Shiv's damage so the numbers were off. Also the targets I used were at a lower point than what a full build target would be at. So this time around crits are calculated across the board. On Yi's AA damage, on his Q damage, and on his Shiv magic damage. I also used two different kinds of runes on him. AD reds and Armor Pen reds. [I also used 21 points in the Offensive tree.](http://i.imgur.com/ymEwi3I.png) I included 2% damage from all sources (except true damage), Frenzy's bonus attack speed, and 5% more damage to targets under 50% health from Executioner. The builds however were the same from last time.

Berserker's Greaves, Youmuu's Ghostblade (active), Infinity Edge, Bloodthirster, Phantom Dancer, Last Whisper  
Berserker's Greaves, Youmuu's Ghostblade (active), Infinity Edge, Bloodthirster, Statikk Shiv, Last Whisper  
Berserker's Greaves, Youmuu's Ghostblade (active), Infinity Edge, Blade of the Ruined King, Phantom Dancer, Last Whisper  
Berserker's Greaves, Youmuu's Ghostblade (active), Infinity Edge, Blade of the Ruined King, Statikk Shiv, Last Whisper

For targets I now used 3 full build targets. A very squishy champ, the tankiest ADC, and a tank. All these targets also used magic resist per level blues and armor yellows. For the squishy target I chose Zyra who had Liandry's Torment and Zhonya's Hourglass as health and defensive items with [9 points in the defensive mastery tree.](http://i.imgur.com/cvpQB5J.png) Her health, armor, and magic resist at level 18 were 2125, 133, and 56 respectively.

For the tankiest ADC I used Graves who had his passive fully stacked and had either Guardian's Angel or Randuin's Omen as a defensive item. He also had [9 points in the defensive mastery tree.](http://i.imgur.com/cvpQB5J.png) His health, armor, and magic resist at level 18 were 2060, 170.6, and 102 for GA and 2560, 190.6, and 62 for Randuin's.

For the tank target I chose Shen with Armor boots, Sunfire Cape, Locket of the Iron Solari, Spirit Visage, Trinity Force, and either Warmog's or Randuin's as his last item. He also had [22 points in the defensive mastery tree.](http://i.imgur.com/ac0uF6W.png) I did apply the 2 less damage from all sources (except for true damage), 3 less damage from all AA's, 10% less crit damage from all sources (this includes Master Yi's Q), and 3% less damage from all sources (except for true damage). Shen's health, armor, and magic resist at level 18 were 4675.84, 170.6, and 113.475 with Warmog's and 4155.84, 261.3, and 113.475 with Randuin's.

When calculating the damage from items, actives, passives and whatever else was there I did include Q's damage, BotRK's active damage, and Shiv's damage all the time if applicable. However for Q and Shiv I did two separate calculations for if they did or did not crit since you Q once at the beginning before you auto attack them and since Shiv only procced once during all the fights (Yes, everybody died in under 10 auto attacks).

After all that pre-explanation here is all the data I collected: http://sdrv.ms/12QhWBB

**TL;DR:** If you want to kill a lower health/armor target go BotRK with either PD or Shiv with Armor Pen reds. If you want to kill a tanky ADC without Randuin's go BotRK with either PD or Shiv. Reds don't matter here. However if the ADC has Randuin's go BT with PD and Armor Pen reds but only if your Q crits. If your Q doesn't crit then go BotRK with PD. If you want to kill a tank with or without Randuin's go BotRK with PD and Armor Pen reds.

**TL;DR of the TL;DR: Run BotRK, PD, and Armor Pen reds on Yi.**

Now here are the results:

**KEY:**  
BRK = Blade of the Ruined King  
BT = Bloodthirster  
PD = Phantom Dancer  
Shiv = Statikk Shiv  
AD = Attack Damage Reds  
AR = Armor Pen Reds

Remember Q and any actives are applied first before auto attacks.

<TEXT> Yeah I am planning on redoing these calculations tonight with crit damage taken in. Also will be taking in effect mastery and rune pages for both Yi and the target he is attacking. Also the targets will be based of champions level 18 values. Squishiest champ at 18 with full build, tankiest ADC with either GA or Randuins, and Shen with a full build with either Randuins or not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually haven't tried Hunter's Machete on him in jungle because my thinking was if you just build longsword first you can build into Ghostblade even faster. Looking at the numbers Yi at level 1 with longsword (no masteries or runes) has 68.1 damage so his Q would do 93.1 damage (with out armor reductions for jungle creeps). With Machete you do 10% more damage so you would have 83.1 base Q damage and 91.41 damage from Q accounting for Butcher. However Machete also gives you 10 bonus magic damage per attack. If you look at the resistance numbers for the blue golem they have 12 armor and -10 MR.

So looking at it roughly you would probably have a faster clear time with Machete but you can build into Ghostblade faster with longsword and when you get E you will do more damage with longsword because Machete's passive doesnt increase true damage dealt to monsters. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The main problem with Yi is that he is melee but he has AD carry level health. You are super vulnerable in melee range and if you don't kill your targets in mere seconds without retaliation you die almost instantly without your team's help. Even with your team's help you can't just Q into a 5 man team fight because you can be bursted down quickly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've actually started longsword, 2 red pots in the jungle. Do a smiteless blue with your team. Level W and meditate to gain back a good chunk of health. Go to red and smite it. Get level 3 and level E. Now just rotate though camps and keep farming while using W to heal when low and E when your Q is on cooldown. I try farming up to Brutalizer before I first go back. If my mid laner lets me I take the second blue it helps alot so you can farm even faster. Youmuu's is 1363 once you get Brutalizer so you can get it fairly quickly. If your team really needs ganks you can gank well with Brutalizer and your ulti before you get Youmuu's.

My full blade with Ghostblade is in this order. Ghostblade, Boots of Mobility, IE, BotRK, Statikk Shiv, LW. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I did some calculations about Master Yi's Damage Output </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-02 08:04:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After playing a couple Master Yi games I wanted to see what items would be better on him. PD vs Shiv, and BT vs BotRK. I believed that Shiv and BotRK would be better overall than PD and BT so I decided to calculate some numbers.

Here are all the numbers I calculated: http://sdrv.ms/12Kqvhf

The base build was: Berserker's Greaves, Youmuu's Ghostblade, Infinity Edge, and Last Whisper. The damage item was either Bloodthirster or Blade of the Ruined King and the attack speed item was either Phantom Dancer or Statikk Shiv. Also these numbers don't take in account crits at all (so Statikk Shiv's passive is not added on as damage) so its just base AD numbers from items. These numbers also assume that Master Yi has his E activated for true damage.

I also wanted to see how much faster you would kill somebody if you used Q on them first and/or you used the BotRK active on them.

The targets I used either had 1500, 2000, or 2500 health, and either had 50, 100, or 150 armor.

Here are some results:

**Time to kill a 1500 health target with 50 armor:**

PD, BotRK, using Q, not using BotRK active: 3 AA's in 1.2 seconds  
PD, BotRK, using Q, using BotRK active: 3 AA's in 1.2 seconds  
Shiv, BotRK, using Q, not using BotRK active: 3 AA's in 1.204 seconds  
Shiv, BotRK, using Q, using BotRK active: 3 AA's in 1.204 seconds  
PD, BT, using Q: 3 AA's in 1.311 seconds  
Shiv, BT, using Q: 3 AA's in 1.351 seconds  
PD, BotRK, not using Q, not using BotRK active: 4 AA's in 1.6 seconds  
PD, BotRK, not using Q, using BotRK active: 4 AA's in 1.6 seconds  
Shiv, BotRK, not using Q, not using BotRK active: 4 AA's in 1.605 seconds  
Shiv, BotRK, not using Q, using BotRK active: 4 AA's in 1.605 seconds  
PD, BT, not using Q: 4 AA's in 1.748 seconds  
Shiv, BT, not using Q: 4 AA's in 1.802 seconds  
_________________________________________________________

**Time to kill a 2500 health target with 150 armor:**

PD, BotRK, using Q, using BotRK active: 6 AA's in 2.4 seconds  
Shiv, BotRK, using Q, using BotRK active: 6 AA's in 2.408 seconds  
PD, BT, using Q: 6 AA's in 2.623 seconds  
Shiv, BT, using Q: 6 AA's in 2.703 seconds  
PD, BotRK, using Q, not using BotRK active: 7 AA's in 2.8 seconds  
PD, BotRK, not using Q, using BotRK active: 7 AA's in 2.8 seconds  
Shiv, BotRK, using Q, not using BotRK active: 7 AA's in 2.81 seconds  
Shiv, BotRK, not using Q, using BotRK active: 7 AA's in 2.81 seconds  
PD, BT, not using Q: 7 AA's in 3.06 seconds  
Shiv, BT, not using Q: 7 AA's in 3.153 seconds  
PD, BotRK, not using Q, not using BotRK active: 8 AA's in 3.2 seconds  
Shiv, BotRK, not using Q, not using BotRK active: 8 AA's in 3.211 seconds  

**EDIT: I will be redoing these numbers tonight with crit damage and Shiv damage taken into consideration. Also I will use masteries and 2 different rune pages in the calculations as well. The targets will also be changed so they are more realistic. A full build squishy, a full build on the tankiest ADC, and a full build Shen. They will also have mastery and rune pages taken into effect and I will also be using Randuins on the ADC and Shen calculations.** </TEXT>

I had an argument yesterday about what Vayne build would be stronger (AS build or AD build). I did all the calculations using Excel and plotted out the damage of each auto attack and what time they would fire at. Today I decided to make a better more organized version of that chart that could be applied to all champions.

Let me run through how it works.

Champion Stats: The base stats for the champ you want. Enter their current level, base mana, mana per level, base AD, AD per level, base AS, AS per level, etc. Basically if the cell isn't calculating a value you can enter something there. If it is calculating a value (like AD or Crit Damage) then don't change the value because it is adjusting the number based upon entered data.

From Items: Right under the champ stats there are extra calculated values for the items you have. You don't need to edit any of these cells.

Items: The item build you want. Enter the name of the item and then enter the stats the item gives. Also if you want to keep track of special passives then just mark it with an asterisk at the end of the row. I added Nashor's, Muramana, BotRK, and Deathcap because they all have special passives that need extra calculation. Notice the asterisk in E15 which denotes that I modified the formula for cell E14 to account for the extra AP that Deathcap gives.

Dummy Stats: This is the target your champion is auto attacking. You can set the health, armor, and MR. Then the damage reduction %'s will be given. Actual is without any reductions. Reduction and reduction % calculates the dummy's resistances after reductions are taken into account (AR- and MR- stats). Total and total % calculate the dummy's resistances after all reductions are counted (ArPen and MPen). Also note that the %'s listed are what would be listed on a champion for how much % damage they block (what is listed in game).

AA #/Time to Kill Chart: This is where all the numbers come together. This chart counts the number of auto attacks you do, what time they were fired at, and all the stats for each of those auto attacks. Let me go through each column individually.

AA #: What auto attack number you are on

Time: What time you fired the auto attack at. This number is 1/current AS.

Mana: Your current mana. This is being calculated because of Muramana's toggle.

AD: The AD from your items without their passives you do to the dummy after all resistance calculations are made.

AP: The AP damage you do to the dummy after all resistance calculations are made. This calculation is currently assuming you have the Spellblade mastery which does 5% of your AP as AA AP damage.

True: The true damage you are doing per attack.

Bonus AD: The bonus AD you are doing per attack. I put Muramana's and BotRK's damage calculations in here.  Muramana consumes 3% of your mana and then does double the number of mana consumed as physical damage. BotRK does 5% of the targets current health as physical damage. These numbers are then reduced by the targets resistances.

Bonus AP: The bonus AP you are doing per attack. I put TF's E passive damage here. For the calculation if it is your 4th auto attack then you get the bonus damage. Also Nashor's Tooth does on hit damage so I also put its damage here as well. These numbers are then reduced by the targets resistances.

Bonus True: Just for a clearer example of auto attack number dependent skills I put Vayne's W passive here. On every 3rd auto attack she does true damage based upon the targets max health.

Total: The total amount of damage being done.

Health: The target's health after damage calculations.

Hopefully I explained what is going on pretty well. There are a lot of things this sheet is missing like the ability to count red elixir, item build costs, crit chance (yeah it doesnt count for crits at all yet), damage over time attacks (red buff), masteries, and more. If you have things I should add to this or want more explanation on how to use this let me know by PM or by commenting. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Scarizard talked a little about having two charges of Karma [here](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=36787714#36787714).

Something that's been brought up a lot in this thread is 'TWO MANTRA WHERe'; fundamentally, if 'High Impact Mantra' is to exist, double-cast must be out. It's something i think works on Rengar but fails here. How cool can Q2, W2, or E2 be if you can cast them independent of the cooldown on the base skills? How much weaker do the 'Empowered' versions have to be? This was a failing of the old kit that we felt was to be solved on a new Karma. - Scarizard

Basically it looks like they thought giving Karma two charges would either be too strong and that they would have to tone down the rest of her skills by giving her two charges. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It has been almost 4 months since Karma's rework was launched. It's initial launch was met with both joy and hate. Now Karma is getting more changes on PBE and I saw a number of posts calling these changes nerfs when I view them as a buff. Also interspersed in those threads were comments on how people still want the old Karma back. I was confused by this because I saw the Karma rework as a much needed change to Karma. I had played the old Karma a couple times before her rework and could use her somewhat but was always frustrated when she came up short. Now when I play the new Karma I can use her more effectively as a champion.

However when I was looking over these posts on the PBE forums I saw that a lot of people said that the new Karma lost old Karma's feel. They felt like Riot made a new champ and then gave her the name Karma. I can see where they are coming from but I also wanted to know what Riot's response was to this. I found out that there is a 969 (and growing) page post in the Champion Discussion forums about Karma. I didn't read it all but I read the red posts and it looks like Riot wanted to try to keep the spirit of Karma in the rework but also had to make a champion that worked and was balanceable.

Personally I love her as a champion, both in her new form and her old form but I just wanted to get some community feedback about the whole Karma situation.

Here are some links that I looked at while writing this:

<TEXT> Yeah I can see where the game has its merits but what the devs did is beyond redeemable. They knowingly release a game that was terrible for like $30. It was an obvious cash grab trying to ride the wave of DayZ. They added micro-transactions very early into the game. When people start asking for refunds they do everything they can possibly do to not give people their money back. They ban a large portion of the community for bad talking the game. The devs openly say they use hacks while playing. The producer of the game (Sergey Titov) tries to defend the game but doesn't address and completely ignores the games problems. It might be an alright game now but the devs do not deserve the money. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Lucian's ultimate doesn't look like what I envisioned </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-11 20:38:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I first saw Lucian in game I thought he looked cool. His ultimate is one the best parts about his kit. Firing a barrage of light bolts towards your enemies is just awesome. However the more I thought about it the more I felt like what his ultimate currently looks like doesn't look like what it should look like.

Let me try to explain this more. Obviously Lucian takes homage from the movies Equilibrium and The Matrix. When you look at his currently ultimate ability icon it looks like this.

[The Culling](http://riot-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/images/news/July_2013/LR/The_Culling.png)

You can clearly see bullet trails/bullet traces that look like these bullet trails from The Matrix movies. Here are three examples of those trails.

[Bullet time from the helipad scene in The Matrix](http://youtu.be/KNrSNcaYiZg?t=2m3s)

[Neo becomes the One in the end of The Matrix](http://youtu.be/zYwdzYC3uUc?t=28s)

[Neo dodging bullets](http://www.legomatrix.com/images/scene12f.jpg)

In all 3 examples you can see the bullet trails clearly behind the bullets that are being fired. However right now on PBE Lucian's ultimate looks almost nothing like his ultimate ability image or these three examples. Here is what it currently looks like now

[Lucian's current ulti visuals](http://youtu.be/fkLxokYkofE?t=13m12s)

His ultimate bullets are large and their trails are short. It does feel powerful but it doesn't look as I imagined. I think that the ultimate bullets should be smaller and have long bullet trails behind the bullets. I made a mock up of what the old ultimate looks like and what I imagine the new ultimate should look like.

[Old Ultimate vs New Ultimate](http://i.imgur.com/ea8KOPX.png)

The red colored arrows come out of the left gun and the blue colored arrows come out of the right gun. In the old ultimate the bullets as pictures are big and have short trails. Also when you have a faster attack speed the bullets tend to overlap each other with the old ultimate as seen here.

[Lucian ultimate 2.5 attack speed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tANROflS-_4)

With my proposed change the ultimate would look more like Lucian's ultimate ability icon and look more like the bullet trails in the Matrix scenes. Also with higher attack speed the bullet particles shouldn't run over each other as much and will probably look cleaner. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had the chance to play with Scarizard, ZenonTheStoic, and Ququroon on PBE last night and got to see Scarizard show off his Lucian skills and Ququroon show off his Master Yi skills. These videos are basically recordings of the PBE replay feature. I think these videos give a very good look at what the two champs can do.

<TITLE> I tried making some abilities for Lucian the Gun Templar </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-01 05:46:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Since there arent many ADCs in the game I wanted to come up with an idea for another ADC. The leak of Lucian was really cool looking so I decided to come up with abilities for him. Since he is a gun Templar I wanted him to be the master of auto attacking champions. He gets all his power from using auto attack resets to kill targets. I also wanted him to be more of an up close champion being quick and agile being able to reposition himself in battle very quickly. I basically only thought up his abilities, what his range should be, what his attack speed should be around, and what his movement speed should be around.

**Health**: ?  
**Health Regen**: ?  
**Mana**: Will be a mana based champion.  
**Mana Regen**: ?  
**Range**: Either 500 or 525. I want him to be almost in the middle of battles kind of like Graves or Vayne.  
**Attack Damage**: Probably around the lower base damage ADCs  
**Base Attack Speed**: 0.625  
**Increase per level**: ?  
**Value at 18**: ?  
**Additional Attack Speed to cap at 18**: Between 250% and 300%  
**Armor**: ?  
**Magic Resist**: ?  
**Movement Speed**: 335 Makes him one of the faster ADCs  

**Abilities**:  
**Passive**: Lucian gains 10% attack speed for each auto attack he does. This stacks up to 10 times giving him a total of 100% bonus attack speed. Also each of his abilities reset his auto attack timer and give him one stack of his passive.

**Q**: Lucian gains 1.2/1.4/1.6/1.8/2 times his passive stacks attack speed and then fires two auto attacks towards a target. This is also unaffected by the auto attack timer.
So for example if Lucian has 5 stacks on his passive and he fires his Q then those next two attacks will have a 100% attack speed bonus instead of 50% (at level 5) and since its not affected by the auto attack timer Lucian may be able to fire another shot in between or right after those two shots.

**W**: Lucian gains 1/2/3/4/5 movement speed * the number of stacks he has on his passive. This movement speed bonus decreases over the duration of 5 seconds.

**E**: Lucian dashes to just inside his attack range from a selected target. He can activate this ability from probably around a 750 range.

**R: Executioners Calling**: Lucian focuses himself for 1 second (rooting and silencing himself). After the channel he gains 5/10/20% attack speed and 5/10/20 bonus movement speed for every enemy champion in a 1000 radius. I have not figured out how long this bonus should last.

In lane I see Lucian using the power of auto attack resets to manually increase his auto attack speed. Hes kind of like Draven but instead of doing extra damage by catching axes he does extra damage by manually increasing his attack speed through auto attack resets. In team fights I see Lucian channeling his ultimate right before or just as a fight starts and then quickly moving around the fight to take out targets/kite champions.

This is also my first time thinking up anything for a champion so I would love to hear lots of feedback! Thanks!

<TEXT> Basically to change the weather location go to the root folder of the skin, Settings/variables.inc. Open that file and you will see the line WeatherLoctaion=USMA0046. To change that to your local location go to weather.com. Look up your location, then when the page is finished loading copy the location code from the URL. For example Miami, FL would be USFL0316 and San Francisco would be USCA0987. Take that code and paste it into where the old code was and then save and update the skin.

Hope this helps. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I stared up a game of blind normals. Was going to try out Eve jungle because I hadn't played Eve since she got her ulti changed. As the chat loads I see somebody call top (we will call them rox) and then somebody else call top. Since calling for roles is tradition in blind normals I say that rox called top first. The other person then proceeds to say top 3 more times in chat. He then says since he said it 4 times in chat that obviously means he should be able to take that spot. I honestly thought he was joking because of how ridiculous that sounded. Then he claimed that rox and I were a duo. I said no and that I just felt like he was being a jerk to rox. He then said he was going to check to see if we were a duo once the game loaded.

When everybody finished loading rox (who was playing Jayce) said he would take mid or top (the other person was playing Yi and I was jungle) and let Yi into whatever lane he preferred (mid or top). We were blue side so both of them had to help me with wolves and blue. Once we get to blue Yi Alpha Strikes blue just before I last hit it (I was going for a smiteless) so he can take it and then he proceeds to follow Jayce into mid now claiming he wants mid now. Jayce is obviously fed up with this and politely asks the other team if they can report Master Yi. Usually I never ever ask the other team to report somebody on my team but this time I did due to the ridiculousness of the situation. I quickly explain what happened in team select and what happened just before they went into lane. Yi then starts lying in all chat about how we were trying to troll him and that we were being uncooperative. Our Ashe also then chimed in and said to report our Yi. They never even said anything before in team chat. The Lux on the enemy team believed Jayce and I and said they would report Yi after the game.

When 20 minutes finally rolled around with both our top lane and bottom lane turrets gone our entire team agreed to surrender (except Yi of course who was still saying we were lying about everything we said). The entire other team said they would report Yi for us and were sorry that Yi was even on our team. I then asked rox (the Jayce) if I could friend him and actually play a duo game with him sometime and he accepted. Here is the little convo we had after the game.

roxaswins if you read this I just want to thank you for trying to be level headed in a situation where people usually just rage and then not cooperate when somebody ruins their game. Hope to play with you soon! </TEXT>

<TEXT> 4th year working as a park ranger in a state park. 40 hours a week, $8.25 an hour. It's ok. I just got promoted so I do even less work now but its way more boring. Basically I bike to a location in the park. Stand there for 60-120 minutes then go back to base and take a break for 15-30 minutes. Then go back out and do it again, for 8 hours. Also I have to work weekends and holidays (but on holidays we get extra pay). It sucks that I lose my summer but making over $3000 by the end of the summer is pretty awesome. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Atheism is, in a broad sense, the rejection of belief in the existence of deities. In a narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities. Most inclusively, atheism is simply the absence of belief that any deities exist. Atheism is contrasted with theism, which in its most general form is the belief that at least one deity exists.

from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism

/r/atheism loves to circlejerk saying they believe in science. Simply atheism is the rejection of the belief that there is a god (or gods). Basically they believe there is no god. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can see where you are coming from but in my personal experience in Bronze (currently Bronze I) it's much easier to bend over backwards for your team. For me I prefer ADC, then Mid or Top. I say this in chat. If I'm first pick I'll wait out the ban timers till the last second to see what people want to play. If people only call one position I'll ask if they can play anything else. If everybody calls a position and one position is open that I don't usually play (jungle or support) I'll just take that position because I rather trust myself in those roles than somebody else who just calls one position.

I assume most people on the subreddit take ranked more seriously than normals and they come in with a good pool of champions and know how to play a couple people in each position. This is the same for me. If I have to go jungle I have maybe 5 or 6 champs I can chose from and if i have to go support I can choose from 3 or 4 champs. I have practiced them enough before going into ranked so that I feel comfortable playing them even though they are not my preferred positions.

Also by playing a role you can play even though you usually don't you learn more about that position and the next time you have to play it you have a better chance of winning. Would you rather play a position you know really well and force some other guy to play a position you have no idea he knows how to play or would you rather play a position you know ok but let some other guy play a position he wants to play. I would rather trust the other person in the position they want than in the position they don't want. </TEXT>

When you want to play 5 v 5 normal team battles you play on Summoners Rift, when you want to play 3 v 3, you play on Twisted Treeline, when you want to play ARAM, you play on the Howling Abyss, when you want to play 5 v 5 dominion you play on the Crystal Scar. Each mode was designed for one map. Also balancing for a new map would be almost impossible because some champs could be really OP or UP with a different map. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My Own Experience

I started playing the game right as it came out on Steam accidentally. You could see it was really unpolished (but not as unpolished as Smite when I first played it). It was also really fucking fun. With the new influx of people mainly everybody was on the same level and it was fun. For the first month or two everything was looking pretty good. After a while though people started leaving the game. Good players stuck around though and any new players that would play the game got matched against those new players. This lead to new players not coming back to the game. The good players got even better and stomped even harder on the new players. Repeat till we get to today.

Also it seems like the long standing player base is very elitist and basically doesn't give a fuck about teaching new players. I know some do try to help new players and explain how the game works but some of them just love to stomp and show of their skills. This fact was the reason I quit the game. I was fairly good but not as good as the people who were in the game since beta. I could pretty much hold my own though. Some of the peoples actions in game disgusted me so much that I really didn't want to be part of the community anymore.

The last reason is that all the champs were overpowered in one way or another. People on the forums still complain about every class being overpowered in some way or another. Vet with the claw and his 3 grapples. Assassin with her super damaging back grapple. Assault with almost infinite fly. Tank with tons of damage. Gunner with slam and tons of damage. Spark with tons of damage. Basically you get the point. Since the game came from its MNC roots where everything was overpowered there, new players couldn't really adapt to dying in a second to some pro they don't know how to counter.

I still love the game and hope it makes a comeback some day but I've moved on for now. Maybe Uber can take it off steam. Launch Planetary Annihilation. Get some money from that or make a Kickstarter for SMNC and relaunch the game fresh, new, rebalanced, and more accessible. </TEXT>

I'm thinking about getting an Intel CPU and mobo and maybe bump up to 16 GB of ram. I would be making this purchase this summer. What would be the best time to do this and what would be the best CPU and mobo combo to go with. I use this computer for gaming but I also want to get into streaming and recording games as well so that't why I wanted to upgrade my CPU. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off Irelia has a slow AA animation so I can understand how it's hard to last hit with her.

When you play as Irelia you have to know what skills your laning opponent has and when they are on and off cooldown. If you want to harass them you need to go in at the right moment.

When I play Irelia I take one point in E then Q then W and then max W first (Q second). When you get into lane last hit as normal. Maybe you should go into a couple practice games and practice last hitting with her. In lane when the opponent hits you you should be able to E them back, stun them and get a couple hits of before moving back.

Once you learn W you can E them, activate W and then trade pretty easily. However I only do this combo when the opponent attacks me so I can get the stun. You really shouldn't need to use Q ever in lane unless you are chasing your opponent and you know you can do more damage. Just learn when you can trade with opponents and you should come out on top. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My first skin and layout. It took me about 6 hours to get everything the way I wanted. 2 hours were spent on trying to get the weather skin to work correctly.

1920 by 1080  
.rmskin: http://sdrv.ms/Y7DYxv (Download the Mirrors_Edge_1.rmskin file that is selected)  
Background: http://i.imgur.com/aISP3ai.jpg

If you click on the CPU or RAM text the task manager opens up. There is also a settings file in MirrorsEdge\Settings. In there you can edit the color value to get the colored text of your choice and you can also edit the weather location code. The weather skin gets data from weather.com.

Hope you enjoy!

EDIT: Tried some new colors out based on suggestions  
Orange: http://i.imgur.com/9FX72OF.jpg (229,124,0)  
Red: http://i.imgur.com/NO2SNFI.jpg (255,54,41)  
Black: http://i.imgur.com/JQofq1m.jpg (0,0,0)

EDIT 2: New download link. Added borders to the test to increase visibility. Border color can be changed in variables file.

<TITLE> [Troubleshooting] Headset Static Problems </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When using my headset sometimes people say that my voice turns completely roboticy and they can't hear me at all. I've tested my headset on another computer and it sounds completely fine. I also just sent my headset in for a repair so I'm sure that it is not the problem. Also the static problem does not happen all the time with my mic but it seems kind of random. I'm guessing there is a problem with my motherboard. Here are my specs:

<TEXT> Have you heard of Super Monday Night Combat? (Super MNC on steam). It's a third person MOBA but it has some different elements like tagging instead of last hitting. I think it's really fun even though the community is basically dead already and the people that are left are either really good or suck.

<TEXT> When I build Vi I focus on getting as much attack speed as possible. I start in the jungle and build Triforce first. If they don't have much magic damage on their team I get Berserker's. Then I build Zephyr, Frozen Mallet,  Phantom Dancer, and Infinity Edge to replace Wriggle's Lantern if the game gets that far. She gets about 270 damage and 2.3 attack speed (with her passive) with that build. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Has anybody tried playing Battlefield 3 multiplayer for PC recently? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-11-28 08:01:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I tried connecting to Battlefield servers today and I actually got it to connect to servers repeatedly today. This is how I got it to work.

1. Try to join a game with a ping of 25 or over.
2. Once the game icon appears on the taskbar click on it.
3. The game windows will pop up and will flash loading in the bottom right corner and then disappear. The game window will be completely black now.
4. After a couple of seconds the game window should close and you should get the error no reply from server. This was the error that was happening before and should only happen the first time you try to connect to a server this way.
5. Repeat steps 1-3 again with a different server except this time after the game window flashes loading it will stay black for a couple of seconds then the map loading screen should come up. This means you are actually in the server.

These steps seem to work most of the time. Sometimes you don't need to click on the game icon on your taskbar for it to work. However sometimes the game does not connect if you do not click on the icon. I've tried connecting to the same server with out clicking on the icon and it doesn't connect but if I try connecting to that server again and do click on the icon it does connect so you should just click on the icon every time. I also have Go to game when ready checked but that should make no difference.

If anybody else has the game for PC and is having issues try the steps I listed above. It you do get the game to work please post back here. Also if you still cannot get the game to work please still post here with what error(s) you are getting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Order Time**: Wednesday, November 7th, 1:10 AM

**Order Method**: Online (Business Premiere)

**Color**: Matte Cyan

**Shipping Status**: Unknown (Preprocessing)

**Shipping Method**: Unknown  
____________________________________________________________
So I ordered the phone as soon as it went up online. It was a little weird for me because I have a University discount applied to my account so I had to order through Premier. I ordered Cyan and they said it should arrive on the Friday of the official launch. On Friday I called AT T and they said that it was still processing and to wait. On Monday it still had not arrived and I called them again and they said my phone was on backorder and could take anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks to get to me.

After I heard that I basically said fuck that, cancelled the pre-order, walked down to the Microsoft Store near my dorm to try to get the 920 in Cyan. They were also out of stock so I settled for the Matte Black instead. I love the phone but I still wish I could get it in cyan.

Another thing AT T messed up on was my phone transfer. Apparently I lost messaging when I switched devices so I had to contact them again and they had to reactivate messaging for my phone even though I didn't change my plan at all. </TEXT>

Hi! I have been thinking about building a PC for a little while now because I have a really old laptop and would like something better to use while at my desk in my dorm. I started with this basic build from [here](http://www.choosemypc.net/build/?budget=650 usage=gaming form=microatx oc=false) and adjusted it where I though I should. Some thoughts:

CPU: I wanted a quad-core CPU instead of a dual core because I also want to do some in game recording (Dxtory).
EDIT: Moved to an AMD CPU because it is cheaper

Storage: Only a regular HDD instead of adding a SSD also because I don't really feel like I need an SSD. [Here](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/jcw7) is another look at this list with an SSD.

Video Card: Went for the 7950 instead of the 7850 and took out the SSD option. See link above.
EDIT: Changed to the GTX 660 Ti after some recommendations. Also I heard you get Borderlands 2 for free with it.

Optical Drive: I don't even really want to buy this because I only have 1 game I need to install by CD which is Flight Simulator X.
EDIT: I don't really need a CD drive anymore.

Monitor: I need a monitor. I almost have no preference besides the bigger the better.

Keyboard: I would prefer a wireless keyboard.

This list will probably be updated soon after getting a couple more people to look over it. Thanks for all the help!

EDIT: Some changes. Also went with a ATX Mid Tower instead of a mATX. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live in Rhode Island and we have this exact system. Does it really change anything...not really. Once you get your limited drivers licence people treat it like a full license anyway. Drive all their friends, drive while distracted, drive while drunk. Parents don't care about the times when their child can drive at all.

What this law is really doing is basically trying to make up for shitty parents and kids who don't follow the rules. If a child knew driving while texting is idiotic and that driving while drunk should never ever ever be done we would be fine but that doesn't happen. Peer pressure doesn't help with this either.

It also doesn't change the fact that older drivers suck at driving too and how easy it is to get a license once you turn 18. In Rhode island once you turn 18 you can go to the DMV take the computerized test (it's really easy, most of it is just what sign is this). Get your learners permit. Take the road test 2 months later. Pass the ridiculous road test (apparently one of my friends passed even though he did a rolling stop at 3 stop signs and that is supposed to be an instant fail). Then you are perfectly good to drive. Why is it when I turn 18 I'm magically better than my 17 years, 11 months, and 30 days former self? This act sounds like a good idea but doesn't really fix the issue. It's like putting a small band-aid on a gash wound. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have scoliosis too but I only found out when i was like 16 but I probably had it since 15 or 14. I wore a brace for like 1.5 years (16 hours a day, every day) then stopped wearing it because 1. it sucks and 2. it was getting too small for me so it hurt really fucking bad. I just went to the doctor again like 2 weeks ago and its about 49 degrees which is really bad but they don't want to do surgery and since I'm basically done growing they said I'm probably good. Also I'm a guy and guys get it like never so that was fun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kind of. It was the iD Gaming Camp at Harvard University for Programming for the Xbox 360 (C#/XNA). I'm guessing it would be a little different than a regular tech camp cause we stayed overnight for 2 weeks.

Anyway it was fun. It really would depend on what you are doing also. For mine we started slow by learning basic programming and progressed from there. I already knew a lot about C# and XNA so I helped other students during that time. We also had a final project and the Friday of the first week I got to start my final project early because I basically knew everything they were teaching. Everybody in the class made a final project but they were all very similar because the teacher was stepping though the project and students could make art changes or code changes they were comfortable with.

Since it also was a gaming camp we played lots of games. Basically our day was wake up at Emmanuel College (that's where we were staying), walk to the T, ride the T to Harvard, eat breakfast, work for like 2 hours, have an outside break for like an hour, eat lunch, work for about 3 hours, then have gaming time for like 2 hours. Then we took the T back to Emmanuel and hung out there till lights out.

It was fun. We made friends quickly. There were 3 other sections besides mine, Level Building with UDK, Map Making with Starcraft 2, and Model Making with Maya. There were about 50 kids (13-18) in total. Also I was 17 so I was older than basically everybody. Our counselors were pretty cool and they were all either in college or just out of college but they knew their stuff.

**TL;DR It was fun. I had fun. I did get to work on something I enjoy. And you will have fun!**  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is my third year working at a state park as a ranger. However my mom did work at the main office for the department and that's how I got my job there.

I did also land a job as technical support at my college for the school year. They sent me a letter saying they were looking to hire freshmen. I was like what the heck doesn't hurt to apply. I did really well on the phone interview and I did pretty well on the in person interview and I got hired.

Just look around and apply wherever you can because it doesn't hurt to try. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah. I main Sin and it is extremely annoying how her most powerful skill (grapple) makes her completely exposed. She loses cloak and her grapple times are extremely long. Spark was basically fine because his skill was being able to deal a lot of main fire damage. Sin and Wascot should have been buffed up to his level instead of Spark being brought down to their level. They can still dominate if played effectively but any class can do that. If a team has even a shred of intelligence they will stick together and commandos can't do anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've heard this many times from my college counselors this year. It isn't all about your GPA. Why would a school accept all really smart kids. The school wouldn't be diverse at all (not just the race way). Colleges want a whole range of kids, really smart kids, kids who play sports, theater kids, tech people. This does include people with lesser grades.

Hell, I got into NEU (Northeastern) with a pretty good scholarship and a 3.07 GPA but I have lots of game programming experience I showed them. I guess that helped. </TEXT>

When doing that the game does not just generate the chunk they go to, it generates all the chunks along the way as well. Because of all the chunks the map has to generate at once the server will crash. I don't think we want server crashing. NoCheat will probably be staying on. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> City Biosphere is located at +1376 +1419. This is south-east of spawn

The plan for the city is to have player houses and city resources (farms, chest rooms, furnace rooms) to be located in biospheres. Each sphere should be themed to a different biome (you can choose your own biome theme).

If you want to join all the city needs now is resources (sand and coal are the two biggest things). After the base sphere is built the home spheres will be built above it. The main sphere size is 51 in diameter and the home spheres will probably 25 in diameter (this may be changed). Please do not build anything large (houses, roads, etc.) because the city is just in the first stages. Also place your chests/furnaces outside the large main sphere. All you need to do is collect sand and coal to make glass (there is a large desert at +1573 +1762 which is a little south of the city).

Thanks and have fun! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't at all though. I interviewed my pastor one time for religion class (I do not attend a Catholic or public school) and he said that the most important thing he sees is the relationship between you and God and that the relationship should be personal. I personally take that as trying to be just a good person. 

My actions shouldn't be any different than somebody who doesn't believe in God. By being born into religion, like the kids mentioned in the story. They saw what they grew up in and after they learned more about the world they could question what they believed to be true. This happens a lot in high school and college where kids learn the most about themselves. By questioning their own beliefs and seeing what was wrong with those beliefs and choosing how to live the rest of their life they are growing a lot as a person and **it is for the better no matter what they choose if they have truly soul searched.**  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If DICE is licensing stuff from other studios in EA for the public to use it every single user would have to purchase a licence for each thing that DICE doesn't directly own and that would cost a large amount of money. The only way DICE could feasibly make mod tools would be to custom make mod tools that had no licensed material in them which would probably be a big undertaking and would probably not be fiscally feasible.

tl;dr It would cost too much money for us if they released it the way it is now and it would cost too much money for EA/DICE to make mod tools for us. </TEXT>

On console yes it still needs the nerf but on PC the last person I saw using USAS and frags was 3 weeks ago and I play a lot (and on Metro where the gun would be the most effective). It really isn't that much of a problem to a pretty good player (on PC, consoles still need that nerf). </TEXT>

As the video stated other weapons balance difficultly of use with more damage. The G3A3 has a slower rate of fire and more recoil than other assault weapons but off sets the difficulty by giving a higher damage per bullet. Since it is harder to directly hit a target with frag rounds there should be compensation for this increased difficulty by increasing the damage per round. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A Discussion About Shotgun Frag Rounds </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-01-21 22:45:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Shotgun frag rounds are an interesting choice for shotguns. Here is the official Battlelog description of it

An advanced explosive round, FRAG rounds provides enhanced suppression but lacks accuracy or stopping power.

There are two ways you can look at frag rounds, an overpowered super weapon which should be nerfed and an underpowered weapon that needs to be buffed. Just some background information: Frag rounds for semi auto and full auto shotguns were nerfed in the Dec 6th patch for PC's, I have heard that on consoles frag rounds deal pre-patch damage.

**Pre-Patch Damage Semi Auto/Full Auto**

60 damage up to 8 meters with a fall off to 34 (I think, it could be 10) damage at 40 meters.

**Post-Patch Damage Semi Auto/Full Auto**

20 damage up to 8 meters with a fall off to 10 damage at 40 meters.

Pump action shotguns were not affected by the patch and have consistently dealt the same damage. 60 up to 8 meters with a fall off to 10 damage at 40 meters.

We can all agree that frag rounds for semi auto and full auto shotguns were overpowered but now there is disagreement. Some say they are still overpowered, some say they are fine, some say they need to be buffed a little.

**ARGUMENT FOR BUFFING FRAG ROUNDS**

Let us look at this video to see one good argument for why frag rounds for semi auto shotguns should be buffed a little.

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQUWD4Lpdk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQUWD4Lpdk)

His major points:

* Frag rounds have one of the slowest or the slowest projectile speeds which means the player must compensate more for bullet drop and the target's movement.
* Shotguns fire slower which means the player will have fewer opportunities to damage his target in the same amount of time as other weapons

**So the more difficult the weapon is to use the higher the payoff should be for using the weapon effectively. This would mean frag rounds for semi auto shotguns should deal more damage due to the increased skill it takes to use them.**

He then does some tests by getting the first shot at the enemy before they can fire back. He loses at every range. (At closer ranges they were shooting head shots so that probably skewed the results).

After all this you could argue that frag rounds for semi auto shotguns could use a buff.

(Also check out this video for more info about this: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgLWw8GSdVI](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgLWw8GSdVI)).

**ARGUMENT FOR NERFING FRAG ROUNDS**

Now lets look at the other side. Frag rounds deal massive amounts of suppression and also deal 240% damage for headshots (other weapons only deal 200% for headshots). Frag rounds also deal explosive damage  which means you do not even have to hit the target to damage them. A full auto frag round user can turn a corner and take out 5 or 6 guys fairly quickly which would not be possible with other weapons...I actually do not have any other reasons why you would want to nerf frag rounds. If you have any post them in the comments.

**ARGUMENT THAT FRAG ROUNDS ARE FINE**

The easy way to look at this is that frag rounds were OP before and if they were nerfed anymore their effectiveness would be almost 0 because their damage output would be even lower. This is a really bad way to say they are fine because that doesn't help anyone. There is another way to look at them. Remember the description of frag rounds. Have enhanced suppression but lack stopping power. You can look at frag rounds as a supportive weapon type. Instead of trying to use it offensively use it as team support. If your team is trying to attack an well fortified position use frag rounds to suppress enemies so that your team can take them down. Frag rounds are excellent at confusing, disorienting, and scaring the enemy. They do not need to deal a whole lot of damage because they deal a whole lot of suppression.

[Battlefield 3 Rules of Conduct](http://help.ea.com/article/battlefield-rules-of-conduct?showhome=true) and [EA Terms of Service](http://tos.ea.com/legalapp/WEBTERMS/US/en/PC/). The rules of conduct say that you cannot break the terms of service of your servers. Let me refer to number 11: Rules of Conduct line 2:

Harass, threaten, embarrass, spam or do anything else to another player that is unwanted, such as repeatedly sending unwanted messages or making personal attacks or statements about race, sexual orientation, religion, heritage, etc.

Kicking somebody based solely on their gender probably breaks this rule which then breaks the Rules of Conduct for servers.

<TEXT> Russia can steal US vehicles. Also C is supposed to be a tactical point. Without that point you can lose the game, that's the whole point. Should your team only defend C and lose every other point or should your team distribute defense around the island leaving C more vulnerable. Everything in this game is pro and cons. Should i use a fast firing rifle with lower damage and more recoil or a slower firing weapon with less ammo, less recoil, and more damage? If everything was just simple and easy the game would lose depth. Without depth and complexities the game would get boring very quickly. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Guide to Shotguns </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-01-01 03:35:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Shotguns are awesome. In the right circumstances you can take down many enemies very quickly. In the wrong circumstances you will be killed quickly. Each shotgun fills a specific role and has different play styles.

**Ammunition**

**NOTE: All shotguns give 240% damage in the head, 100% damage for body and arm shots, and 90% damage for legs.**

**Buckshot**

The default ammo for all shotguns. Each shell has 12 pellets (except for the MK3A1) and each pellet gives 20 damage up to 5 meters and then drops off to 6 damage at 25 meters.

Usually this is the go to ammo for me. When used in the proper situation (up close) an enemy goes down fairly quickly.

**Flechette**

The first ammo unlock for all shotguns (except the DAO which comes with it and the M320 which only has buckshot). Also has 12 arrows in each shell (except for the MK3A1) and each arrow gives 14.3 damage out to 12 meters and then drops off to 8.4 damage at 25 meters.

I do not use this ammo as much because it deals less damage up close. However it does deal more damage farther away.

**Frag**

The second ammo unlock for all shotguns (except the M320). Fires an explosive round at the target. For pump shotguns it gives 60 damage up to 9 meters then drops down to 10 damage at 40 meters. For semi auto and auto shotguns it gives 20 damage at 9 meters and then drops down to 10 damage at 40 meters. Frag rounds also deal blast 30 blast damage up to 3 meters away. However blast damage and direct damage do not compound. If you directly hit your target they will only receive the direct damage and no blast damage.

EDIT: The blast damage can also hurt you if you are too close. If you hit a wall or person that is really close to you, you will be damaged. Also the explosive damage lingers around for a second or two so if you wander into an area you just shot at you may still be damaged.

It was awesome with semi autos and full autos before it was nerfed. I do not use it as much now, if at all because direct damage is so small now. (It takes 5 body shots to kill somebody).

**Slug**

The last ammo unlock for all shotguns (except the M320). Fires a large metal slug at the target. For pump shotguns it gives 100 damage up to 9 meters and then drops off to 34 damage at 40 meters. For semi auto and auto shotguns it gives 50 damage at 9 meters and then drops off to 10 damage at 40 meters.

Rarely use this one. It requires very good aim because you are only firing 1 "bullet" at somebody and it takes a longer time for you to fire again than most other guns.

**Pump Shotguns**

**NOTE: Pump shotguns have a smaller cone of 2.0 compared to the cone of 4.0 for semi auto and auto shotguns. This means your bullets travel closer together and you will deal more damage at range. (On http://symthic.com it only says that this applies to the 870MCS but it probably also applies to the other pump shotguns).**

**870MCS**

Takes up the primary slot, and is an all kit weapon. It takes 0.55 seconds between shots. It has a reload time of 0.67 seconds (per shell) and an empty reload time of 1.3 seconds (the first round you reload will take 1.3 seconds, every other shell will take 0.67). It is unlocked at rank 1. Because the cone is smaller it will give more damage farther away than the semi auto and auto shotguns. It however takes more time to fire between shots so getting in close and not missing when firing is very important. This shotgun also has the added bonus of being able to stop the reload action and fire. If you are reloading and you see an enemy you can stop the reload and fire again.

This gun is best used in close quarters when you behind the enemy, if you can surprise your target you can finish them off quickly and move to the next one. If somebody gets too close to you, you can take them out quickly.

**M320 Buck**

Assualt only. Yes the M320 has a buckshot option. It is unlocked with 10 kills with the M320 frag (M320 is unlocked with 11,000 assault score). It should behave like a pump action shotgun but I am not sure. It takes a long time to fire between shots (same reload time as the M320 frag and smoke). It can be used with an underslung rail which allows it to have the same scope you are using for your assault rifle, the scope that comes with it is the same as the M320 frag and smoke scope. Would not recommend because of the slow reload time and the fact there are better options for shotguns. It its ammo also count as a frag so more ammo is obtained by using the frag perk, not the ammo perk. Has 4 rounds with no frag perk and 7 rounds with frag perk.

EDIT: I have not used the M320 Buck as much. Apparently it is better than I have said. Go have fun and try it out.

**M26 MASS**

Assault only. This is an interesting shotgun. It is listed as a semi auto shotgun in Battlelog but it feels like a pump shotgun. You pump the shotgun in game and I have also killed people at longer ranges than other semi auto shotguns so I assume it behaves like a pump shotgun in game. Can also be used with the underslung rail. Much better than the M320 buckshot. It is also much more quiet than other shotguns so it is great if you can get behind the enemy. Has 5 + 1 rounds and has 18 extra shells for a total of 24. Squad ammo gives it 30 extra rounds. It is unlocked with 38,000 assault score.

This is a really fun shotgun to use. It does replace the medic pack however. Great to use in close range situations. Perfect for maps that have long range and short range encounters (you can have an assault rifle and also carry the MASS).

**Semi Auto Shotguns**

**NOTE: All semi auto shotguns fire at 200 RPM and have a cone of 4.0.**

**M1014**

Fun shotgun to use. Has 4 + 1 rounds without extended mags and 6 + 1 with extended rounds. It has a reload rate of 0.55 seconds when not empty and 1 second when empty. It is unlocked at rank 22. It behaves like the 870MCS in that you can stop the reload animation and start firing again. That is what makes this gun fun to use. It is great for running into the action and getting up close and personal with the enemy. If you need to reload you can start reloading but then start firing again whenever you need to.

**SAIGA 12K**

Has 5 + 1 rounds without extended mags and 8 + 1 rounds with. It has a reload rate 2.2 seconds when not empty and 3.5 seconds when empty. It is unlocked at rank 34. I do not see a big reason to use this shotgun. It does not have any special feature which makes it awesome or fun to use. Would not recommend.

**DAO-12**

Also a fun shotgun to use. Has 7 + 1 rounds without extended mags and has 11 + 1 rounds with extended mags. It comes with the Physical Warfare Pack but is also unlocked at rank 38. Has a reload time of 0.69 seconds when not empty and 2.15 seconds when empty. It behaves like the M1014 and the 870MCS in the fact that you can stop the reload animation and start firing again when needed. Also good for running into the action and getting up close to the enemy.

**Auto Shotguns**

**USAS-12**

A very fun weapon to use. It fires at a rate of 275 RPM, has 5 + 1 rounds without extended mags, and 10 + 1 with extended mags. It is unlocked at rank 43. This weapon is used for crowd control, if there are multiple enemies bunched up in a small area you can take them down quickly and easily.

This was very fun and very overpowered when used with frag rounds before they were nerfed. (Yes, I was one of the people using, USAS, frag rounds, and IRNV) I normally use buckshot with it now.

**MK3A1**

Looks awesome, sounds awesome, isn't that awesome to use. It is similar to the USAS but it only fires at 255 RPM and has the same amount of rounds as the USAS. Unlike all other shotguns it only fires 9 pellets instead of 12 pellets. It also seems to be bugged in game which gives it a higher spread than the USAS. I see no reason to use this shotgun. Like the SAIGA it has nothing to make it stand out. To unlock you need 10 Kills with the PP-19, 5 Kills with the DPV Jeep, 10 Kills with the BTR-90 APC, 2 Hours played on Sharqi Peninsula, and 2 Hours played on Gulf of Oman. Before you can unlock this weapon you must also unlock the PP-19 which requires you to, ARM 10 MCOM stations, get 10 Flag captures, and play 2 hours on Strike at Karkand.

Overall shotguns are awesome. I got my first recon service star with only shotguns and PDW's. I never touched a sniper rifle when getting the first service star (aggressive recon FTW). They need to be used in close quarter situations and you need to aim well. If used in the right situation you will dominate the battlefield.

Happy shooting! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love all shotguns (also PDW's). I have service stars for all of them and 10 service stars for the USAS (yes yes  #3232;\_ #3232;). Frag rounds were awesome (and overpowered) before they were nerfed. Now they really aren't scary unless you get attacked from the back. Each shotgun fits a certain role which is awesome (except for the SAIGA, doesn't seem like there is any reason to use it).

<TEXT> Yep. It is much harder to hit somebody with the actual round than to just hit around them at a certain range. Semi auto and full auto frag rounds only give 20 damage at 10 meters and drop down to 10 damage at 40. They got a crazy nerf. (The blast damage is 30. I would trade blast damage for more direct damage in a heartbeat.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sound in Battlefield 3 is really good, it allows you to listen for the enemy while looking for him. If you are trying to capture a flag and you know an enemy is somewhere listen for him reloading, shouting, or moving around (footstep sounds sometimes are not that loud or do not work at all sometimes). You can throw a grenade and if it lands near them they will yell something about a grenade.

You can also listen for recon devices. The spawn beacon will make a beeping sound. If you are sneaking up on an area listen for a T-UGS or a MAV. They will make one beeping noise if no enemy is near it and another beeping noise if an enemy is near it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> There is a difference between a recon and a sniper </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-12-19 17:48:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The sniper class has to very different play styles. You can either be a sniper, the style people usually think of when they see a recon, or an actual recon. Many snipers I see just camp out somewhere far away from the objectives with a spawn beacon and a motion sensor. Yes there are some snipers who can actually hit targets without missing 3 times first and that are an asset to their team.

Then there are the recons, people who use a PDW or a shotgun and are on the front lines. Sneaking around, not blowing up tanks because recons do not have C4, capping points, spotting people, setting up a MAV at a point right before the rest of the squad tries to take it. These people are often a great asset to their team if played correctly.

Then we also have subsets of those play styles. A mobile sniper can still be moving around, setting up at points before their squad gets there and proving support and spotting when they are capturing. An aggressive recon can have a sniper rifle but can be on the front lines sniping up close, taking out objectives and enemies.

My favorite time to be a recon is on rush, especially Metro rush (8 v 8). I can flank and get behind the enemy, plant a spawn beacon behind their lines, get to the MCOM and plant a motion sensor, arm it, then defend it from the waves of enemies with my shotgun or PDW, always knowing where they are. I got my recon service star without even touching a sniper rifle.

We all sometimes just want to stay back and snipe people, after I got the M98B I did this, but when you play he recon class or see a recon don't just assume sniper, you can actually be a great asset to your team. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very Portable Devices. Smartphones and tablets. Smartphones are getting better and better and tablets are now getting big. Windows 8 will probably change the tablet market because it is now being built for touch and will have more power than any tablet out there (the x86 and x64 versions).

These portable devices will need apps and app development is really big right now. Making apps is getting easier and easier, it is just about getting noticed. Games are getting smaller and are being played for only 5-10 minutes on the bus or on the subway.

The final thing is really the internet. **Everything** is being connected to the internet. CD are now being replaced by digital downloads. New netbooks and laptops are not being installed with CD drives. The last time I used a CD was when I first got my computer about 6 months ago to re install my old games. Every portable device will be connected to the internet, to each other. Mobile service providers (cellphone companies) are going to do very well by offering services to these devices. Actual 4G will push us into the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Metro Rush Assault (8 v 8 works the best)

* General Tip: Arm as quickly as possible and arm both objectives at the same time.

* General Tip: Listen for the enemy disarming the charge. If they are you can usually rush in and kill them because they are distracted and stop the disarm.



First Set of Objectives - Rush down the right side along the path right of B or in the water right along the ground so it is harder to see you. Usually the defenders rush middle. When you are just past B along the path stay far right, right of the rocks and set up a spawn beacon right before the out of bounds area, usually on the path not the grass. Next 1 or 2 players should watch defender spawn while the rest of the squad checks the area and goes for B. To go for A run right along the defender out of bounds area and check the bridge, the rocks on the left (between A and B), and right of the bridge. When defending the objective stay in front of the objectives (closer to defender spawn) because you want to see them first.

Second Set of Objectives - Rush down the right side tunnel (above the subway) and check for any enemies in the subway area. Run across to the middle tunnel or go all the way across and go through the boarded up area. If in the middle tunnel take the first left to be right before the subway cars on the left. Place a spawn beacon right before the cars on the right side of that tunnel right behind the wall. Usually the enemy is past you by now so you can either run for the middle escalators or run straight for A. Arm A and you can run right for B because you are on the escalators. Defend B from on top of the stairs and check the escalator for enemies. With A some people can camp in the bathroom but some other people should be checking for enemies constantly from their spawn. Also one person can stay left A and left of the subway cars and look right though the A bathroom to kill enemies who are entering.

Third Set of Objectives - To go for B run to the right side stairs and go through the right hallway. Arm B. If there are many enemies over there then run right next to that hallway on the wall right of the middle escalator. You can get around the enemy team and shoot them in the back and then arm B. The best way to arm A is to either run up the first escalators and go straight for A while another squad is going up the middle escalators and checking for enemies from there. You can also attack A from the middle escalators.

Last Set of Objectives - Exit the metro building from either the right or left doors. The center ones usually get you killed. To attack A get into the left side building and run around to the defender facing side. Place a spawn beacon somewhere on that side. Break though the wood and arm A. You can leave the building and sit right inside the stairwell right next to the MCOM or go through the other set of windows next to the MCOM and listen to enemies disarm the MCOM from there. If they are rush in and kill them. To attack B either go down the far left set of stairs or go down the far right street. Run all the way across to the bushes and check for enemies in the MCOM area and in their spawn. Make sure it is clear and arm B. Then go back into the bush area and kill enemies that go for the MCOM. When attacking B it is also very helpful to have people in the buildings facing the defender  spawn high up killing enemies who are going for the MCOM. The earlier you kill them the better it is.

GOOD LUCK AND HAVE FUN!

For defenders it really just consists of continuous movement and never staying in the same place. Only one or two people should try to get behind the enemy and shoot them in the back. If you don't find anybody then keep going towards an objective to see if the enemy is closer to the objective than you think. If the MCOM is armed and you are not behind the enemy go straight for the MCOM and kill any enemies you see along the way. Don't kill the enemies first. The priority is the MCOM. If you are behind the enemy run your usual path behind the enemy, don't go straight for the MCOM. You will usually surprise the enemy who is defending your spawn. When somebody is disarming defend them at all costs. The MCOM is the most important thing, not your KDR. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I can see how a gamepad would be hard to fly helicopter (Yes I do play on PC). However using a forward speed technique also can work. If you can spot your target from far away enough then if you aim well enough you can hit them while flying towards them pretty fast. You really need to make sure you can turn around quick enough after roaring past them because usually they will jump out and repair. Also if they are moving then it is also harder because you have to lead your shots. Practicing on the second Co-Op mission (Fire From the Sky) as pilot is a good idea. It lets you fight infantry, tanks, and AA. I will try to make a video of me flying helicopter ASAP so you can see my technique. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What is your preferred set up as pilot / gunner?

Pilot

* Upgrade: Air Radar
* Gadget: Extinguisher
* Weapon: Heat Seekers

Gunner

* Upgrade: Maintenance
* Gadget: Thermal Optics
* Weapon: TV Missile

Is it worth giving up flares for another upgrade, or is flares a must have?

The three gadgets for pilot are IR Flares, Extinguisher, and ECM Jammer. ECM Jammer seems to do nothing so don't use that. Flares are nice but they really can't help you when you are getting hit by bullets (from a tank, or AA, or jet). Once you get down below 50% you have to bail or land and repair. With extinguisher you run the risk of being taken down really quickly with heat seekers if you get locked on to twice and get fired upon really quickly. Usually you get hit with two missiles or one stinger missile and get disabled. Then you can pop extinguisher and fly away really quickly and let your helicopter heal itself. Extinguisher usually reloads when your helicopter gets to about 80% without getting hit again. It really just helps you stay in the air longer than IR Flares.

And if so should both have flares or just one?

I think that is up to you and your gunner. If you are actually cooperating and planning out your loadouts (for me its hard to find somebody to do that) it is up to what you want. The gunner gadgets are IR Flares, Zoom Optics, and Thermal Optics. If you can pick out people and tanks in the map easily then the gunner should use IR Flares. Thermal Optics makes it really easy to see people though so I personally use that. I do not know if gunner and pilot have flares then the helicopter has two sets. I would think not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What's your favorite setup?

Pilot

* Upgrade: Air Radar
* Gadget: Extinguisher
* Weapon: Heat Seekers

Gunner

* Upgrade: Maintenance
* Gadget: Thermal Optics
* Weapon: TV Missile

What setup gets you the most points?

The one I use currently :D . For pilot air radar lets me see all vehicles within a certain area which is really nice. Extinguisher lets me stay in the air longer than flares do. If I get down below 50% I can pop extinguisher and heal up somewhere away from the action. With IR Flares you have to land and repair once you get down past 50%. Heat Seekers are the only weapon for the pilot and that is a must.

For gunner maintenance helps the helicopter recover faster which helps out. Thermal optics light up any vehicle and person (they show up as white). This really helps with people cause it is hard to see them usually when flying. TV Missile is the last unlock and it has a further range than guided missiles and can travel a further distance than guided missiles. You don't have to be as close to your target to hit it. Use guided missiles when you don't have TV missiles.

What one tip helped you get all teh unlocks?

Practice. I first learned how to fly during the second CO-OP mission. My partner went AFK and I did the whole mission in the pilot seat. After that I just kept playing on a Caspian Border only server. Getting all the unlocks. One thing that you really need to get down is control of the helicopter. Being able to slowly hover over to a tank unleash a volley of rockets behind it disabling it, flying past it and quickly turning around, firing another volley of rockets to finish it off is a really good skill to learn. (This also helps with those pesky AA tanks, sneak up behind it and doing this technique helps take them down quickly without really damaging yourself).

How do all-unlocked choppers stand up to all-unlocked jets?

I don't really know because I don't think I have fought an all-unlocked jet. However jets can be annoying if they see you from far away. The best tactic is to get down low and fly fast in the direction the jet is coming from. They turn around slowly so if you fly under them going in the opposite direction as them, they usually lose sight of you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only tactic that seems to work for that is to know exactly where it is and then sneak up behind it. I've been playing on Caspian Border a lot so if you die to it and it is camping out in a field fly on the far outskirts (behind the hills) and sneak up on it. Then when attacking make sure you disable it in the first volley of rockets. Reload and hit it again. That should take care of it. A good AA gunner will probably fuck your shit up what ever you try to do :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was a good game when it was closed beta and early open beta. There were no pay to win weapons. I watched a video Ben Cousins gave about why they changed from their balanced weapon shop to a pay to win weapon shop.

Basically they weren't making enough money and EA was going to shut their whole studio down if they didn't start making more money. They really didn't want to put in pay to win weapons. Their original plan was to only put in cosmetic items for pay but they really didn't want to lose their jobs either so they put in the pay to win weapons. After that there was some backlash but they made much much more money.

It's still fun to play every once in a while but I wouldn't spend money on that game. I have BF3 to look forward to :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> better stress and bug test - plus leaving a better impression.

Maybe I did not make it clear that they were doing a true beta test by stressing the servers. It really doesn't matter which version of the game you use if you are stress testing your servers. Also they probably don't care as much about pleasing people during a beta when they want to please during launch. Don't just take my word for it. You can see it on the blog.

[Just by joining, you will help us stress test servers, allow us to run important tests on the games back-end, and find potential issues to track.](http://blogs.battlefield.com/2011/09/welcome_to_the_early_access_of_the_battlefield_3_open_beta/)

and 

[Just like normal procedure when releasing a game, the Open Beta has had long lead times due to testing, certification, and setting up. This means that the code you are now playing is actually quite early and not representative of the final game.](http://blogs.battlefield.com/2011/10/battlefield-3-open-beta-update-2/)

same link

[The biggest reason for running the Open Beta is to stress test our servers and back end. Already, we are seeing 6 times the number of simultaneous players in the Battlefield 3 Open Beta compared to the Beta for Battlefield: Bad Company 2! The fact that Battlefield 3 is clearly our biggest game launch ever by a magnitude of 6 makes it doubly important to test everything.](http://blogs.battlefield.com/2011/10/battlefield-3-open-beta-update-2/)

<TEXT> I'm pretty sure there were a couple reasons for releasing a old version and keeping a new version.

1. They wanted to keep the beta the same for all platforms. The console versions need to go through validation so the console that takes the longest to validate for beta is the version that gets used for the beta (read that somewhere).

2. They wanted to update the new code with out messing with the old code. It also draws from point 1. If they released and old version of the beta they started working on it after it got launched. They didn't wait around for the bugs to come in. They got shit done. If they tried to release a newer version then they would have to wait for validation.

Basically it's the consoles that slow down the release cycle for beta. If they didn't have to worry about console validation and could release as quickly as possible they could have done weekly or nightly releases for the beta, uploading them and us downloading them to test. But they couldn't, the console validation got in their way.

TL:DR Console validation made it not possible to have a "good" version of beta to test. They could just update PC all the time but they didn't want to. I can see why. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sure DICE would rather turn people away with a shit beta and release a glorious game than release a "good" beta and focus too much on pleasing people then instead of making launch as good as it can be.

This is a true beta. It isn't gold yet. Has any true beta been perfect. It takes time for something to become truly amazing and by testing the game in beta DICE can really know what is wrong with the game. They even said what they have fixed since beta has come out and even said there might be a day 1 patch with stuff fixed in beta.

then they shouldn't have released that version of the beta

The reason they did release this version of the beta was to fix the real code for launch. They can't work on both, they have to think about releasing it for testing and validation so it can hit shelves on time.

He has sent things to other Actionauts before (like t-shirts, posters and other swag). He is an awesome dude and it's great to know him (in internet terms). </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you could point to a specific point where he was...maybe your talking about DrWiley (also a cool dude). Maybe you joined the community late where nothing was happening and IA was on it's way out. I know everybody hated Crash and Wiley at that point. Mainly cause Crash couldn't give ANY information about what was happening and Wiley was so involved in other projects that he was really out of it and wasn't as enthusiastic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Crash7800 is an awesome guy. He used to be the community manager for InstantAction (it got shut down last year). Did like weekly podcats (yes podcats) and was always talking to the community. The BF3 community is much larger than the IA community but Crash knows what he's doing. I think he understand how frustrated and angry the community can get and is really good at diffusing that anger and helping the community understand what is happening.

TL:DR Crash7800 is awesome and he's heading to DICE headquarters soon and probably will try his best to get our frustrations across to the developers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Guys usually act differently around guys than girls. A straight guy would usually be thinking that there is a 0% change I am going to be attracted to this guy (sexually) so they don't really have to worry about acting physically awkward around them if they are friends/bros.

For example I (straight) could put my arm around one of my friends (straight) and it would just be funny cause we would never be attracted to each other. I might not to the same to a friend who is a girl because it might be awkward or weird even though it probably wont be.

The reason why they do it around you even though they know you are gay is that its probably subconscious. They act that way around all guy friends no matter the attraction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was looking at these plans...what the shit?
I have a family plan with 4 Verizon services (Home phone, mobile phone, tv, and internet). Its about $100 for all these and 25/20 Mbps internet.

If you are generous with the High Speed Internet Enhanced Plan at 15 Mbps at $40 and look at the FiOS Faster Plan for 25/25 (really 25/20) at $70 the FiOS plan is probably a better deal (and its faster too).

Also I saw this disclaimer under the High Speed Internet Enhanced Plan: Actual speed will be provisioned at the highest optimized speed range at your location. I checked to see if Verizon internet is available out there in Westerly: used 32 Whipple Avenue Westerly 02891 and high speed internet nor FiOS is available there! Check here to see if Internet is available at your house!

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When we are wee, society tells us to like boys or girls or whatever. You are told to like a group of people but when did you actually really realized that you were attracted to them. This might be confusing as it is confusing to explain but let me give my example.

I'm 16, almost 17 IRL, 17 on the internet  #3232;\_ #3232;, anyway my I like girls moment (I'm a guy) happened when I was around 14. It was just like a dawning on me that, HEY! I find girls attractive, not I just want to like them. Then I looked back on the incident where I was in 7th grade and a girl liked me but I brushed her off because I liked girls but didn't really yet.  #3232;\_ #3232;

The reason I ask this question was I saw like 2 7th graders holding hands after school and I was like  #3232;\_ #3232; I didn't even like girls back then.

EDIT: People are just posting ages which is boring, I kind of wanted to know if it was like HEY I like boys/girls or it was just like yeah boys/girls.

Anyway, share your stories reddit!

Waiting for my conformation amounts. Waiting for my bank statements. It was a long process but it payed off. I never pirate myself because I think its wrong in every situation. I can see why other people would pirate the game though. But pirating talk shouldn't be done here. If you are on the border for buying the game. Try to get somebody you know to let you try the game on their account or petition Notch to do more free weekends. </TEXT>

You must donate at least $1 for you to be counted as a person.

From Reddit Mumble:

sirmalloc: there's 170ish people in the whitelist, there are over 3000 on survival over it's lifetime

sirmalloc: if 3000 people donate, i won't reset, how's that?

<TEXT> I made it :D so first off

+1

The glass wall around the spawn area with lightstone makes the spawn visible from far away and acts as a light filled area all the time. The spawn is then linear to make sure people can see all the rules while walking out. The banned items are not stashed in a corner but are pillars for everybody to see. The rules, staff, and other signs are between these pillars so they are easy to see while leaving spawn. The gold and iron blocks in the middle point east and west. The golden blocks representing the sun rising in the east after a long night and the iron blocks representing the moon setting in the west after a long night.

The pillars are also setup to show the banned items are also set up in a specific way. The right side contains the more passive banned blocks. Obsidian, water, and ice. These do not cause major catastrophic destruction. The left side the contains the active banned blocks. TNT, lava, and fire. They are also set up in pairs, TNT and obsidian, the most destructive and the hardest blocks. Lava and water, the two flowing elements. And fire and ice...fire and ice. :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> The amount of gray area for the survival rules sickens me. I say that this grey area bullshit needs to be addressed now before anything else happens with survival. Right now it's a pve but you are able to kill people. No taking their buildings or belongings in chests, you can only kill them OUTSIDE THEIR BASE and then go home. It really is no fun for anybody.

<TEXT> I accidentally broke into your house and killed you because I saw your name through the dirt. I was trying to find the entrance and I was like screw it and broke into the hill which looked like a hill which instead was your house. I did fix your house. I then proceeded to burn you to death because lava is one of the best tactics for pvp. It is kind of boring to only do mod stuff all day so I wanted to do some pvp. I didn't use any kind of mod hacks or anything. I was playing like a regular player. Lava is a hard weapon to use but its very useful.

Once I was being chased by a diamond armor diamond sword wielding person and when I got them to walk into the lava I got he got distracted from chasing me and went to find water and then I hacked him to death. Very useful tactic an it should be kept. </TEXT>

<TEXT> With all the confusion of whats right and whats wrong in the current survival server I want see what the community thinks about the survival server now and what kind of setup they would like in the future. Comment under each idea you want or comment under the other section for posting your own idea. Just because this is posted here it might not actually happen but input would be good for the server. THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL DECISION OR POST. I just want to know what people want. </TEXT>

Cubiod is cool and all but after reading it makes me feel that building awesome things by hand is 10x more awesome than building awesome things with Cuboid. When i saw MegaDome I was amazed but now that I know it was build with Cuboid it makes it less amazing. Do I think its possible with out Cuboid, yes but it would take a really really long time. But if somebody has enough drive and manpower anything can happen. </TEXT>
