<TEXT> "People come to Cauteville all the time. And there they stay. They don't leave Cauteville. No one ever leaves Cauteville." - Fr.Deacon.

Mr.Black and Mr.Grey drove along the country road for hours. The endless landscape of nothing but fields and grassy plains as far as the eye could see was almost hypnotising. It had put Mr.Black and Mr.Grey in a sort of trance. It seemed as though they were driving past the same fields and hills for hours over and over. They hadn't met another car in hours. They would've thought that they'd made a wrong turn but there was no other way to go other than that straight, endless road.

Mr.Black loaded six bullets into his revolver as Mr.Grey drove. They'd been partners for nearly eight years but hadn't learned each other's real names. Something like that could be dangerous if either of them were caught. One usually doesn't make an abundance of "work friends", being a contract killer, but they'd decided to become partners as they worked so well together on their first job. So Mr.Black chose his alias from his ethnicity and Mr.Grey chose his based on his grey hair and personality.

They generally didn't travel too out of their way for work but they would have been stupid to turn down such an easy job for such a handsome fee. Mr.Black slid his gun back into the inner pocket of his suit.

Eventually, a sign came into view. "Cauteville", it said. Mr.Black found it strange that it didn't say "welcome." Most towns he'd been to's signs said "welcome."

They drove past a homeless man happily slurping soup out of a rather over-sized looking pot on the side of the street. Mr.Grey pulled over and parked on the curb. He got out and walked into a shop. Mr.Black didn't argue. Mr.Grey rarely spoke, and when he did, it was usually to tell other people to cease speaking. Mr.Black had learned not to question him.

As he sat there, Mr.Black noticed a rather confused looking old priest coming over to the car. Mr.Black opened his window. The old priest leaned in suddenly and panicked. 

"Murder isn't the worst sin a man can commit !", yelled the priest into the car.

Mr.Black was taken aback as the priest sauntered away. He turned on the car radio and tuned into the local station. The news came on.

"Good afternoon people of Cauteville. This is your newsanchor, Newscaster Carol bringing you the local news that you've probably already heard through the proverbial grapevine. Mayor Caplan has publicly assured the civilians of Cauteville that the velociraptor that has been causing carnage throughout town since Sunday has been successfully captured and put down by the hard working scientists in the Cauteville Scientific Research Facility and that the memorial for the victims will be held in the courtyard of his mansion on Justice Hill. Isn't he just fantastic, ladies and gentlemen ?

In other news, the case of the unidentified serial killer that has claimed the lives of over a dozen Cauteville citizens has been solved. Sheriff Woody Crouk has made a public statement saying that the "serial killer" wasn't a serial killer after all. After some tests done by Doctor Doalot, it turns out that it was just a very lethal and very contagious form of eczema and that there is definitely no need to panic.

And now some advertisements :

 'Let's be honest, a lot of weird shit happens in Cauteville. The chances are, you probably need therapy. So call me, Cauteville's resident psychoanalyst, Wanda "Understanding Lee" Lee.'

'Spouse cheating on you ? Think your kid is doing drugs ? Suspect your parent are actually ghosts ? Then call me. Cauteville's leading and only private investigator, Samantha Psykes.'

'Want to know your future ? When you're going to die ? Because we can do that. No, really. We actually can. Don't believe us ? Then we call your bluff and offer you one free session. Madame Voyante's. We are real, motherfuckers.'

Mr.Black quickly flicked off the radio, wide eyed. He looked out the window at the seemingly idealic town. Mr.Grey climbed back into the car, holding a box. Mr.Back jumped when he saw that the box contained a tarantula.

"What the fuck ?", shouted Mr.Black.

"What ? It was half price."

"If they had a chainsaw for half price would buy that ?"

"Maybe."

"I don't like this place you know, man. I've got a bad feeling about it. Like something real bad's gonna happen."

"You and your feelings."

"Me, my feelings and the fucked up news report I just heard. Some lady from the local station was talking about dinosaurs and killer egzema going around the town."

"Perhaps she was crazy."

"When's the last time you heard of a town that lets an insane person read the goddamn news, Grey ?"

"Listen, that isn't our problem. Our problem is getting this job done asap and getting paid after. Then we don't have to worry about this town for the rest of our rich lives."

"Fine. Where are we meeting our contact. ?"

"Some bar around here somewhere. Shouldn't be hard to find."

Several minutes later, the two men pulled into the parking lot of Cauteville's most popular bar, The Butcher Wife. They both walked into the bar, polar opposites. They wore the same, black and white suit, but Mr.Black's was loosened and worn, whereas Mr.Grey's was pristine, creased at the knees and perfectly tailored. Mr.Grey had meticulously trimmed white facial hair and slicked back grey hair. Mr.Black had frizzy black hair and erratic facial hair.

Mr.Grey took a seat at the booth in the back corner as Mr.Black ordered the drinks. He couldn't see a bartender but saw the open door into the back. 

"Two whiskies", he called into the doorway. He turned around and looked around the bar. There were several people scattered about the room, sipping drinks and making light conversation. He couldn't help but shake the feeling of unease about the place even though, aesthetically, everything was fine. 

He turned around and there were two neat whiskies sitting on the countertop, directly behind him. They had ice and tissues and were definitely fresh. There was no sign of a bartender, however. Mr.Black was sure no one had made two whole drinks behind him without noticing. He shook his head and carried the two drinks over to the table, where their contact was already seated in front of Mr.Grey.

She was a smoking a cigarette and was taking her sunglasses off, despite it being nearly ten at night. She had icy blue eyes and jet black hair down to her neck, framing her face.


"Your friend isn't much of a talker is he ?", she asked.

"No, not all", replied Mr.Black, sitting down. "Hey, how come the barkeep managed to serve me two drinks without me seeing ?"

"Oh, Frank ? He's a ghost."

"Wai- hold up-"

"Was I mislead when I was informed you two were professionals ?"

"No bu-"

"Well then let's get on. I'm Sam Psykes, the P.I from around here. Okay, so you two will be posing as new scientists who'll be trained in at the C.R.S.F. Here are your badges."

"Wait, wait. Hold on, how do we know we can trust you ?"

"Carlos Cortez gave you my info didn't he ?"

"Well, yes....bu-"

"And he hired you two to kill Mayor Caplan, right ?"

"Correct...."

"Well then you two are going to be scientists who are gonna be inducted into a highly secure facility that no one has access to except the scientists and Mayor Caplan. What you do from there is your business."

"How do we know this isn't a trap. Isn't he your mayor ?"

"Mayor Caplan is about as good for this town as Carlos Cortez is for society. Listen, I know Carlos. If anyone crosses him, they die. Mayor Caplan obviously did and now he's going to pay for it. I don't personally like doing favours for Cortez but if it means Caplan is gone, I'm all for it. You have a meeting with Caplan tomorrow. Good luck."

With that, she left the bar, leaving a trail of both smoke and mystery as she disappeared into the night. 

The two men left the bar with their badges. The walked down the street towards the car, before encountering a rather important looking man leaning against a cop car. 

"Hey !", shouted the man at them. Mr.Black went to reach for his gun. "You two are the new scientists, right ?"

Mr.Black relaxed.

"I'm Sheriff Crouk", he stuck out his hand. Mr.Black looked at his badge. It had the name Phillip Craig written on it.

"Phil Craig", said Mr.Black shaking his hand.

"What about you ?", asked Sheriff Crouk, looking at Mr.Grey.

Mr.Grey looked at Mr.Black, unamused and unwilling. 

"Ah, he doesn't talk much", stated Mr.Black.

"Alright. Well Mayor Caplan wants to see you two in his house, now, before you have an official meeting tomorrow."

"Right now ?"

"You betcha. Hop in."

They arrived at the mayor's mansion in no time and the pair stepped out of the cop car and entered the house.

They walked into his expansive office and saw him drinking vodka from a ludicrously expensive looking glass. He turned around and revealed himself. He was a large, vaguely Italian looking man with a silk suit and a gold chain around his neck. He opened his arms wide and smiled warmly at them.

"Welcome", he said in deep, husky voice. "You can close the door behind you, Sheriff."

"Hello", was all Mr.Black could think to say.

"I trust you have aquainted yourselves with some of our towns wonderful facilities ?"

"Ah yes, I suppose you could say that. I, uh.....was just curious about some, well, not quite off colour behaviour necessarily, but just a series of odd.....occurences."

"Well this is a unique town, there is no doubt at all about that, but I'm afraid Cauteville does not apologise for it's perculiarities."

"O-okay", said Mr.Black, unsure.

"Now", began Mayor Caplan. "Have a seat."

As they sat down opposite him, the mayor slid two identical forms in front of them. 

"If you sign these", said the mayor, darkness growing quickly into his eyes. "You give your consent to everything that being a member of the staff at the facility entails."

"And what might that be ?", asked Mr.Black, swallowing thickly.

"You will live in the facility. You won't ever leave there the same way no citizens will ever enter there. You will be provided with suitable living quarters. Also signing this contract states that you won't ever reveal any of the things you see or do in there. A word of caution. There are experiments and procedures that will harrow you and probably haunt you for the rest of your life. There will be things that you can't unsee and things that you won't believe, 
even if you do see it."

"I'm quite sure I've seen it all", chuckled Mr.Black, attempting to break the tension.

"I know you haven't seen these things", said the mayor, his whole expression turning dark. "If you sign this, you agree to everything. If not, you can walk away right now."


Mr.Black and Mr.Grey looked at each other and signed their false names.

"Wonderful", exclaimed the mayor, that warm smile returning as easily as it went.

The pair of hired guns made their way back outside and Mr.Black stopped.

"Did you hear that ? There must be all kinds of weird shit going on in there. I don't know if this is such a good idea."

"Do you have any idea how much we're getting paid for this ? A lot. A whole lot. We come in tomorrow and bust a few caps in his Italian ass and then peel the fuck outta here."

"He just said we won't be able to leave. What if we never leave that place, man ?"

"He said that not knowing that a pissed off drug lord wants him dead. Once we end him we can do whatever the fuck we want. No scientist is gonna stop me from claiming this motherfucking bounty."

They both returned to Sheriff Crouk's car and were sped back to their hotel in no time.

The following morning, the two men congregated at Mr.Grey's car. Mr.Black looked around as they drove and could've sworn he saw a cow grazing atop The Butcher Wife. He shook his head and tried to ignore the flock of butterflies skydiving manically in his stomach.

Eventually they arrived at the Cauteville Scientific Research Facility. It took them several tries to get on the right track that led to it. The facility sat in a circular area that had been cleared in a massive, dense forest full of tall trees. They had to drive through a total of four gates just to gain access to the car park.

Mayor Caplan was waiting on the front step, smiling widely. He welcomed them in and had them change into biohazard suits. Luckily they hadn't searched them when they'd come in as Mr.Black had his revolver tucked neatly in his pocket. He stuffed the pistol into the small pocket the suit provided.

"Due to the decidedly small population of Cauteville, I'm afraid we could only amass a security presence of a dozen in the facility but they are well trained and, along with the various technologically advanced security systems, we have no problem with intruders", stated the mayor.

He invited the two of them into his office and sat down. They both looked around. It looked almost exactly what one would expect to see in a rich, corrupt, public figure with authority's office; wild animal's heads mounted on a wall, japanese samurai sword replicas, bookshelves full of tomes that most certainly never got read, large leather chairs and expensive bottles of scotch.

He told them to go to lab number 26 to get inducted. They obliged and left, deciding not to embark on their task while there were three security guards in the room. They headed down several, long, identical corridors.

"What do we do now ?", whispered Mr.Black.

"I guess we circle around until his security leaves."

They both wandered around the endless hallways, not once meeting a soul, before finding themselves back outside the mayor's office. They knelt down and peered into the room. The security were still there and he was on a heated looking phone call. They walked off again down the maze of similar halls, waiting to find themselves back outside his door.

After a few minutes of walking, they heard footsteps behind them. The turned and saw the mayor standing behind them with two security guards on either side of him.

"Ah there you are", said Mr.Black nervously. "We, uh. We got lost."

"Oh you got lost, did you ? Mr.Black ?"

The pair of assassin's faces went slack.

"Turns out it wasn't me who Carlos Cortez wanted dead after all, fellas", shouted the mayor. "Get them guys."

Both the security guards revealed handguns from their pockets and opened fire at the two men. They both dove down another corridor and sprinted into the first unlocked door the could find and slammed it behind them. There, they found a group of scientists crowded around a restrained dinosaur. The scientists looked panicked, dropped their tools and ran out of the room. Suddenly an alarm rang out throughout the whole facility. The velociraptor jerked quickly, tearing out of it's restrainments.

Before they could react, the reptilian monster dove at Mr.Grey, latching onto his neck, tearing a chunk out of it. Mr.Grey collapsed whilst the prehistoric beast ate his way through him. Mr.Black screamed and lunged out of the lab, closing the door behind him. Mr.Grey had died how he had lived. Silent and unwilling.

Mr.Black stumbled down another corridor, pale and frightened. The hallways were now filled with panicked scientists running amock. He saw another group of three guards coming towards him and he ducked into another room. In this room, a team of scientists were crowded around the naked corpse of a young woman. They injected a green substance into her arm and, upon seeing Mr.Black, dropped what they were doing and scuttled back out of the room also.

The dead body then leaped up, fighting against it's restraints, full of life and apparent rage. Mr.Black ran back out of this room and once again found himself outside the mayor's office. He rushed in, jelly legged and panting. He was surprised to find the mayor standing behind his desk. 

"Well hello again, Mr.Black. As you can see, once there is an intruder in the premises, we deal with them very seriously. Terrible shame, about your friend. We could never let him live, though. Not after seeing what he's seen. You should never have come here. You should never have accepted a job from that meth head in the first place. But, I suppose it's best not to dwell on the past, eh Mr.Black ?", spoke the mayor calmly.

"Oh I shouldn't of come here ? I'm the one who should be afraid ? It seems to me like I'm the only one in this room with a gun and your little experiments didn't faze me, neither. So I suggest you either give Carlos Cortez a call or bend over 'cause I am gonna pop so many caps in your ass, you're gonna be sneezing gunpowder for weeks."

"You might have eluded the laboratories and escaped my security but just because I'm the only one without a gun doesn't mean I'm the only one without a weapon. Let's see how you fare with a little friend of mine I like to call The Shape."

With that, the mayor pushed a little red button under his chair and exited his office through a small door behind his desk. The doors of a large oak wardrobe flung open behind Mr.Black. Out stepped a thing that had the approximate shape of a man but was easily twice as tall as Mr.Black and had no bodily features whatsoever. It had a cylindrical, blank head, had skin made out of some kind of black fabric material and it's limbs ended in dangerously sharp points.

The figure swiped it's razor sharp arm at Mr.Black, who easily dodged it. It came at him slowly and then suddenly thrust it's arm at Mr.Black, who had to duck to avoid it. It's arm got lodged in the wall. Mr.Black took out his revolver and shot it twice in the back. He put the gun away upon realising that The Shape simply absorbed the bullets. The Shape, now free of the wall, turned just in time to see Mr.Black plunge a scissors into it's empty face. Again, it didn't even react and the scissors just slid out of it's face and the gash sealed itself up immediately.

Mr.Black stepped back, trying to think of how to stop this thing. He sized it up and noticed it's legs, with ended in fine points. It must be unbalanced. Mr.Black looked around the room and saw one of the mayor's pretentious props on the wall. He hoped to God that it was a convincing replica of a samurai sword. He grabbed and umbrella from behind him, swiped at The Shape's legs, causing it to do the splits.

Mr.Black then lunged for the antique and pulled off the case, surprised to see a very real katana. He placed the blade between The Shape's legs and thrust upwards with all his might, tearing through it's strange skin. The Shape split in half, it's two sides collapsing onto the floor. The now severed halves of The Shape vibrated and flailed about on the floor unthreateningly.

Mr.Black vomited from fear and exhaustion. He walked out through the same door the mayor did and stumbled down a narrow hall, his vision blurring. He fought the urge to faint. He came to a door out into the car park and saw Mayor Caplan getting into a black jeep. Mr.Black shot clumsily at the car, causing a window to explode. 

The mayor ran out from behind his car and Mr.Black pointed his gun at him. The mayor froze. Mr.Black waited for his vision to focus and for his hand to steady. He pulled the trigger and shot four bullets at the mayor, each one ripping a bloody hole in his chest. The mayor collapsed, dead.

Mr.Black dropped his gun. He didn't claim his bounty that day. Instead he ran far and deep into the thick forest and was never seen nor heard from again. Yet another life lost from one of Cauteville's many atrocities. Another healthy mind warped by the sunny town of Cauteville's dark underlying mysteries. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Tales From Cauteville - Story 1 : Silence of the Cows </TITLE>

<TEXT> "People come to Cauteville all the time. And there they stay. They don't leave Cauteville. No one ever leaves Cauteville. No one." - Fr. Deacon.




Henry Robinson and Kate Ming walked hand in hand out of Cauteville High. They walked down the lane opposite their school, towards their houses. They stopped just before the housing estate, and gazed into the field adjacent to the estate.

"So these are the cows huh ?", asked Kate, looking at the herd of cattle, casually grazing in the silent field.

"What cows ?", inquired Henry.

"The 'disappearing cows'. You haven't heard that rumour ?"

"Of course I have. It's wrong, though."

"Of course it's wrong", said Kate.

"They're teleporting cows."


Kate cocked her head, not dissimilar to that of a confused hound.

"Teleporting ?"

"Yup, not disappearing."

"Why ?"

"No one knows why the cows in Cauteville teleport. They just do. That's what they like to do. So they do it."

"How do you know ?", asked Kate.

"I witnessed it."

"When ?"

"A couple months ago. I heard a sound that woke me and as I arose from the bed. There she was. A cow. In my bedroom."

"Did she smell ?"

"Like gunpowder."


Henry and Kate looked on at the cows in the field. Suddenly, the cow closest to them was gone. She didn't run or fly or drive away. She was simply gone with a loud sound similar to a gun shot. The sound echoed through the farm as Kate's eyes widened.


"Some people say that it's Old Farmer Milton keeping an eye on everyone in town. People say he was always nosy", said Henry.

"That makes sense", said Kate. "That must be why he was in my garden last night, looking at me."

"Most likely."

"Have you seen my cat by the way ?"

Henry shook his head.

The pair of teenagers sauntered up to Kate's bedroom. She switched on her tv and left the local news channel on in the backround. The two chatted about school, their personal lives and life in general.

The six o'clock news came on. Newscaster Carol, as the town knew her, came on, as irreverant and erratic as usual.

"Goooood evening ladies and gentlemen", announced Carol. "The Cauteville police have officially solved the recent case of the liquidised human remains found in a trash can just outside the community centre. It turns out they weren't human remains at all. After doing some tests, they quickly realised that it was in fact soup, that Homeless Horace had been storing for the winter. Oh, Horace, you lovable vagrant ! I guess the real mystery is why the police told us that they'd found human remains immediately, before even doing any tests.

 In other news, the mayor, whom we all know and love. Yes, we all love the mayor. Cauteville would be nothing without Mayor Caplan. Hail Mayor Caplan. Anyway, he will be hosting a charity dinner in his mansion over on Justice Hill in aid of adult illiteracy. As far as we know, there aren't any cases of adult illiteracy in Cauteville, but who are we to question Mayor Caplan's judgement ? 

And now the weather. It was raining cats and dogs yesterday in Cauteville. Literally. The mysterious string of missing pets in Cauteville of recent has come to an end, as of yesterday. Several eye-witness reports have stated that they saw 'some kind of portal type thing' open in the sky above the Yellowleaf retirement home and a group of household pets glided, unscathed back down to the streets of Cauteville. The reunited owners of the aforementioned pets have stated that they've noticed a significant increase in the intelligence of their pet. Several pet owners have said that their pet has begun to speak English since their return from the 'portal type thing'. They claim that all the stress is now worth it and whomever was on the other side of that portal should 'keep up the good work.' Thank you and good night".

Hours later, Henry and Kate found themselves on top of Kate's roof, gazing at the stars.

"What do you think it all means ?", asked Kate dreamily.

Henry suspected that Kate had engaged in the type of philosophical and ultimately fruitless conversation that the night sky seemed to elicit.

"What does what all mean ?", he asked.

"Life. What's the point ? Happiness ?"

"One would assume, yes."

"But how do we find it ? Can we ? Is there such thing as a truly content person out there ? And, if so, how do the rest of us follow in their footsteps ?"

"Being someone who has been happy for a significant chunk of my life, I can offer you some wisdom."

"You can ?"

"Indeed.  I believe that if you make human connections that you truly cherish, that's the key to happiness. Love, I believe is the correct term. Then, you treat the rest of life as one big, long and occasionally bland adventure that you embark on with your loved ones. So they can support you. Then, you embark on their adventures and support them."

"It sounds so simple to obatain. Yet, it's the single thing people can't seem to get the hang of."

"I think people are too fragile. Too sensitive to the wrong things. They get hung up about minute details. Silly things. And then life slips away. And so does love. And, in turn, happiness."

Henry and Kate awoke on the roof. It was Saturday morning. They got up and looked at the view from Kate's house. One could just about make out the abandoned mental asylum on Minor Mountain, which was really just a glorified hill on the outskirts of Cauteville that no one ventured to any longer.

Henry and Kate climbed back into Kate's bedroom and they both knew what was happening that day.

"So", began Kate. "Are we going to do this ? Finally ?"

"You mean see inside the Minor Mountain Mental Facility ?"

"Yes. The one we've been planning for weeks. I think we're ready."

"Just don't get too excited. There are rumours that some of the patients haven't left there since it was shut down in the sixties. You might not like what you find."

"Oh, come on Henry. We'll go in, take a few photos and show everyone at school that we are the first ones to go in there. Today might be our only chance. My parents get home from work at six and they'll be home during the day all of next week."

Henry looked at his enthusiastic girlfriend and relented. 'Anyway', he thought. 'Most of the dead people in Cauteville are friendly anyway.'

The couple made their way down the streets of Cauteville, towards Minor Mountain. They passed the church and spotted Father Deacon wandering outside the church. Father Deacon was Cauteville's last surviving priest. Everyone in town knew him, more for his having Parkinson's since he was in his twenties than actual religious work. Deacon's unusually long lasting disease caused a major decline in religious activity in Cauteville since he developed it in the sixties.

He was hobbling along the street outside the church, mumbling to himself.

"A man without empathy is a man without weakness", he whispered to himself. "A man without empathy is a man without weakness."

"Morning Father !", chirped Kate.

The priest turned around suddenly and looked, wide eyed and alarmed at Kate. He took a step back, looking frightened.

"See the man with the white eye and don't expect not to die", he chanted. "See the man with the white eye and fly, fly, fly. See the man with the white eye and the end is nye."

"Father ?", asked Henry. "Are you okay ?"

"Any of you kids got five dollars ?", he asked casually, relaxing.

"Five dollars ?"

"Yeah, I wanna get my coffee but the Starbucks across the street's corporate money vortex is keeping this old guy from getting his cup of joe."

"Sure", said Kate, handing him a fiver. "Have a nice day !"

"Not if Starbucks has it's way", he groaned as he crossed the street.

Eventually Kate and Henry found their way to Minor Mountain. They stepped over the poorly constructed fence, seperating the large, prison like institution from the rest of Cauteville. The pair of teenagers walked cautiously up to the excessively large front doors of the ugly building.

They walked in seeing exactly what one would expect to see in an abandoned mental asylum; randomly abandoned wheelchairs, weird greenish lighting that makes everything look terrifying, ominous scents, occasional holes and sporadical drops of blood.

It sent shivers down Henry's spine and goosebumps along Kate's skin. They traveled into what they presumed was the canteen as there was a vague smell of dried gravy, just barely noticable over the smell of a decomposing asylum. It was a long hall with half of a table overturned in the middle.

"Take a picture !", said Kate excitedly as she sat on one of the two corners left on the table.

Henry held up his phone and looked through the screen. His face turned deathly pale just as he pressed the button. Kate's face went slack when she saw his. He was standing completely still and staring over Kate's shoulder.

Kate turned around in a panic. There was nothing there. 

"Don't scare me like that", said Kate.

Henry didn't answer her, however, as he was staring at his phone. Kate walked over to him and looked at the phone. She peered at the screen and saw, quite clearly, a figure, bolting behind her, just over her left shoulder. It was tall, too tall to be a person. Kate guessed around seven or eight feet. It had clammy, grey skin and had a bald, shiny head with gills in it's neck.

Both of the teens looked at each other.

"I think we'd better get going", said Kate.

They rushed out of the room and headed back towards the entrance. They kept running and running, hall after hall. They ran for mintues, without finding the door.

"I could've sworn the door was around here somewhere", panted Henry, looking around nervously. 

They both entered another room, with an old tv set from the sixties. The screen was long gone and there was some kind of growth spurting from it. The looked around the gloomy room and screamed. They saw a body tied to a giant spinning target. The body consisted of several different parts from several different people. The skinny torso had a gaping hole and several ribs missing. Stitched to the left shoulder was a long, pale arm. Stitched to the right was a short, pudgy one with some kind of yellow liquid on it. The legs were equally disproportional and a rather large doll's head was stuffed into the top of the torso. There were a few knives protruding from it's forehead with frightening accuracy.


"I really think we should leave", stated Kate.

"Okay, let me try and find a window. There's got to be some around here."

Just then, the green gloomy light that seemed to surround everything died down and the whole room turned pitch black. 

"Henry ?", called Kate. "Where are you ?"

"I'm here. I think I found a window. I'll be back in a sec."

"No. Don't leave me here !"

"I'll be right back."

"Don't say that. That never works in movies."

"Just sit tight."

After a couple of minutes waiting in the dark, Kate felt around the room until she felt a doorknob. She pushed open the door and was relieved to see that this room had some source of light. As her eyes adjusted, she saw Henry tied by chicken wire to a rusty metal chair. Looming over him was the creature they saw earlier. 

The creature was easily several feet taller than Kate. The green light created a eerie gleam over it's grey skin. It's gills were fluctuating and it had fingers three times longer than a normal person. The nail attached to each finger was the size of a regular finger. It had a wide, thin lipped mouth that didn't seem to close and had a cave of stalactite-like teeth grinning at her. And it had one eye. One huge, white, unblinking eye. 

It gently wrapped it's bony fingers around Henry's head, easily encircling it twice. The creature yanked calmly upward, seperating Henry's head from his shoulders with unsettling ease. Kate spat out a mouthful of vomit. She stumbled back, watching as whatever chance she had at having any kind of happiness or contentment at all drifted away just as quickly and easily as the tall being ripped Henry's head off of his shoulders.

Kate jogged down a corridor, her head bobbing around, despite her vision deteriorating as she went. Just as she was about to collapse, she spotted a window, just in arms reach, above her. She heard a blood curdling screech and turned around to see another one of those creatures bouncing towards her. It waggled it's long fingers at her playfully as it neared her.

Suddenly, she heard a loud sound, like a gunshot and smelled gunpowder. She nearly fainted as she saw a bull charging down the corridor. She stepped aside as the bull leaped, thrusting it's horns into the creature's neck. The bull stepped back, two streams of black blood jetting from the two holes in the creature's neck. The bull looked at Kate with kindness in it's brown eyes.

Kate thanked the barnyard animal before sprinting at the window. She had gotten half way out when she felt an over sized hand grip tightly on her ankle. Another of the creatures tugged at Kate, pulling her back down. Just as she was about to subside, she heard the sweet sound of hooves. The bull charged into the thing, catching it in the belly, pinning it against the wall. 

Kate escaped into the cool night air and ran. She ran and ran and ran. No one saw Kate Ming after that day. Nothing changed in Cauteville after that. Upon hearing that he'd broken into Minor Mountain Mental Facility, no investigation was launched into Henry Robinson's death. Cauteville knew what became of him. He had been warned not to go there and yet he did. Cauteville blamed Henry for his own untimely demise. They had given him, like so many other teenagers, a verbal warning about the asylum, after all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>   [Episode 2]

Carla screamed as the clown happily jumped up and down in his chair, munching the remainder of the cockroach infested lung. He hadn't even made a sound as of yet, other than the sound of him chewing. Upon seeing that Carla did not, in fact, have an appetite, the clown got up and dragged her in the chair over to a pile of boxes, several of which had body parts hanging out the sides of them.

The clown released her from the chair and bound her hands behind her back. He then pushed her towards an empty box. When she resisted, he pushed her into it and closed the lid. She hit her head on the wood when she fell in and was knocked unconscious.

Several hours later, Carla woke up to the gleefully smiling clown. He reached his gloved hands out and gently lifted her out of the box. He led her over to a separate room at one end of the warehouse. It contained a bed, a set of shelves (which contained several jars of teeth, eyes suspended in water, nails, fingers, noses and genitalia), and a table with different kinds of knives layed out on the table, each encrusted with dried blood.

The clown carefully picked a jar of teeth from the shelf and rattled it in Carla's face as she sat back, screaming on the bed. She leaned back, detecting a newly horrible smell. She looked on the sheets and saw that she was lying in layers of dried urine. The clown, dissatisfied, picked a new jar, of what looked to be some kind of vein or tendon, and handed it to her. He sat down beside her, smiling sheepishly at her and giggling slightly. She took the jar, confused, and smiled weakly as a realisation came over her. This clown wasn't trying to kill her. He was trying to court her.


 [Commercial Break]


Oscar, the newly appointed producer of Tormented, averted his gaze from Carla's horrified look. He looked around the studio where the show was being written and aired from and saw The Director. He walked over to the creator, director, executive producer and occasional writer of Tormented. He was a stylish man who demanded that everyone call him The Director. He had oddly shaped facial hair and always wore a suit.

"Hey", said Oscar to The Director. "Are you seeing this ? This wasn't scripted, was it ?"

"No, but that's the beauty of this show. We just some unscripted tv gold on the second episode", smiled The Director.

"Are you sure we should be doing this ? I mean, we could just hire an actress instead and set the whole thing up, and tell people it's real. This just seems kind've barbaric."

"I've been hearing comments like that since the dawn of this concept. It's 2059, Oscar. This isn't 2010. Do you even remember a little thing called the fall of the United States in 2050 ? The Sickness took the lives of over half the population of the U.S.A in that year alone. We thought that The Sickness would take the other half too, but we prevailed. Because we are strong. And here we are, going strong with a population of 160 million. You may have been too young to appreciate this, but over 160 million American lives were lost nine years ago. The fall of this great country caused what was basically the collapse of our American society. Politicians, soldiers, cops, actors, business people were among the deceased and the whole country went into decline. The government, the law, hospitals, schools and police stations all shut down. People were murdering, stealing, pillaging at leisure. It took nine years, but finally we are still re-establishing a new government with a new constitution, new schools, new hospitals, new law enforcement. And more importantly we are re-establishing a new economy. Which means every person in the country is working long hours in a shitty job for little pay. The people need to know that someone is having a worse day than they are. Enter Carla. We are in the dawn of a new country. We are the first generation of New America", professed The Director.

"But how is this even legal ? How did this even make it on the air ? Is the government okay with this ?", asked Oscar.

"The government gave this project it's full blessing. They're the ones who funded it. Besides, we need new entertainment. Tvs have only begun to come back into production again and the only movies and shows airing are the ones from before The Sickness. We're the first production in New America. And that's a big responsibility. We needed some revolutionary, something ground breaking, not another scripted, wooden trash tv show. And that's what we're doing. Do you see this ? This is a thirty minute commercial break. It's advertising hundereds of businesses in New America. And they're paying us a lot to promote them. Why ? Because we got over 85 million viewers for the first episode. Every business in this country is going to want their spot on this show. We'll be generating billions in no time. We'll be both the fastest growing and most profitable business in the short history of New America soon enough."

"How did you get an actor to eat all that shit last episode by the way ?"

"Oh the clown ? He isn't an actor. Just some crazy off the street who said he'd do it for free."

Oscar looked at him skeptically. 

"Have faith. Trust me. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go shoot a promo.


   [End of Commercial Break]


Carla forced a smile at him and took the gruesome jar gratefully. She didn't exactly know what to do next so she carefully laid down the jar, as though she were saving it for later and slowly walked out of the tiny bedroom. The clown tentatively followed. She looked around but couldn't see any of her belongings. She held her hand up to her ear.

"Phone ?", she asked. "Where's my phone ?"

The clown shook his head furiously. He didn't like that. He didn't like that at all. He took her by the arm and began to lead her back to his bedroom. Upon leading her back to his cramped room, he left and locked the door behind him. He came back minutes later carrying a body with him.

He laid the body down on the bed and handed her a knife from the table. He gestured excitedly towards the body. Carla saw her opportunity. She slashed at the clown, but he dodged her swipe, batting her hand away. He swung his hand, striking her across her cheek. She fell to the ground and feigned unconcsiousness. When the clown reached down to her, she kicked out sending him across the room.

She ran out of the bedroom, racing down into one dark corner of the warehouse. She found a door and ripped it open. She found a group of people with several computers with feeds of the warehouse on them. They looked at her, shellshocked. She stumbled backwards. The clown came from behind and rushed into the room. He carried a machete. For a second, everyone was still. The clown seemed confused and irritated.

The clown slashed one of the crew's necks, sending a stream of blood out everywhere. He embedded the machete in another crewmember's back.


  [Technical Difficulties]


The Director's face went slack. All the screens were static. 

"SOMEONE GET THOSE CAMERAS BACK UP AND RUNNING !", he roared.

Several people ran around The Director, fussing about trying to get the cameras back up.

"I DON'T CARE WHO NEEDS TO DIE NEXT, JUST GET THIS SHOW BACK ON THE GODDAMN AIR !", he screamed.

         
 [Return to Tormented]



Carla, screamed and ran toward the other end of the warehouse. She found the door outside. She ran out into a dense forest. Carla sprinted through the forest and skidded, falling just before an open manhole leading to a sewer. She got up and turned around, just in time to see the clown bounding towards her, his eyebrows arched, screeching manically.

He ran straight into her, causing her to topple over and into the hole. She fell and fell, eventually splashing into a sea of human waste. </TEXT>

[Episode 1]
















Carla Mouer sat in her kitchen reading the note over and over again. It said that she'd been fired from her job. It provided no explanation why and plainly stated that it was in effect immediately. She sat back in her kitchen chair. Why had this happened ? She hadn't done anything recently that even closely warranted her getting fired. In fact, she never did anything that warranted her getting fired.

She hated that job but it was the only one she had. Now she was going to have to go job searching again. God, how she hated fucking job searching. She pried a bottle of wine from the top shelf of her cupboard and sank into the couch in the living room. She began texting a guy she'd met on social media. She was planning on meeting up with him.

Carla woke up an hour later to a heavy rapping on her door. She jerked awake, spilling some of the wine on the floor. She stumbled over to the door and opened it. It was her landlord. She was a squat, pudgy old woman who always smelled like earth and had several warts on her face which she made no effort to cover up.

"I wanna see you downstairs in fifteen", she growled in a raspy voice.
"What, wh-", Carla was cut off by the sound of her landlord slamming her door in her face.

Carla begrudgingly trudged down to her landlord's office. She was waiting at her desk which always had a smoke cloud enveloping it.

"Sit down, Mouer", she groaned. 
"Yes ?", asked Carla as she sat down.
"I haven't gotten any rent from you in over two months. If you don't cough up soon, I'm gonna have to force you out."
"What ? No, I've been paying you. On time. Every month. I leave it in the box outside your door, like you asked me to. Every month."
"There's no use in lying to me, sweet cheeks. The jig is up."
"I'm not lying. Someone must have taken the money out of your box. I told you that thing was a bad idea.

Her landlord looked at Carla with conviction.

"I can take you to court, you know, if your trying to scam me. I have proof of payment."
"Lemme see it."
"Well, it's upstairs."

Suddenly, Carla's landlord's face went slack. She opened her mouth and a stream of blood spewed out and across the table. The blood was thick and sludgy, as though there was some kind of innard mixed in with it. Before Carla could react, her landlord collapsed and had begun gyrating on the floor, foaming at the mouth.

Carla sprinted back up to her room to get her phone. She called an ambulance and came back down to find a group of tenants crowded around her landlord. She didn't look good. She was pale and she wasn't moving. There was a pool of dried blood around her head.

Carla went to the hospital with her in the ambulance. After waiting in the waiting room for over an hour a doctor came out to Carla. He told her she didn't make it.

Carla made her way home, in disbelief about how awful a day she was having. She walked into her apartment block to find the other tenants whispering and looking at her. She frowned and went back up to her apartment. After a few minutes of texting the guy she'd met online she heard another knock on her door. She was tempted not to answer it but after a minute of persistence she gave in and opened it. It was her neighbour from downstairs.

Her neighbour stood there, looking at her. She was a tall, thin woman with wispy blonde hair and a timid face.

"Are you Carla Mouer ?", she asked quietly.
"Yes."
"I'm sorry.......is this a bad time ?"
"No, well, yes but.....what do you need ?"
"Well, I just got a package delivered to my apartment in your name."
"Oh, okay."

The woman stared at her blankly.

"Well, do you have it ?", asked Carla.
"Oh no,  it's in my apartment. I wanted to make sure I found you before I brought it out with me."
"Oh, well you can just drop it outside my door whenever you get the chance", said Carla slowly shutting the door.

The woman jammed her foot against the door abrubtly.

"Why don't you come up and get it now ?"
"Look, I'm having a really shitty day and I don't feel great."
"Oh, do come up. It will make you feel better, to be around people. I don't get visitors very often. It would make my day", she smiled sweetly, but her eyes purveyed no emotion.

Carla eyed her up and down carefully. 

"Okay. Fine. Just for a minute."

Carla followed her up a floor to her apartment.

"Aren't you going to ask me my name ?", asked the woman.
"Huh ?", asked Carla.
"Isn't that the polite thing to do, when you first meet someone ?"
"Okay, what's your name ?"
"Rita. Rita York."
"Okey dokey then."

Rita opened her door and Carla waited outside.

"Won't you come inside ?", asked Rita.
"Oh, no that's okay, I think I'll just wait out here."
"No, come in for some water, you look thirsty. I'm not taking no for an answer."
"Alright, but just for a minute."

Carla went inside and Rita gave her a glass of water. 

"You look like you've had a rough day", she said plainly.
"You have no fucking idea, sister."
"You shouldn't curse so much, you know. It's a sin", said Rita sharply.
"Oh, okay", muttered Carla.

Carla looked up at Rita. There a blood stain on the crotch of her jeans.

"Oh god", chirped Carla, looking away. "I, uh, I think you've had an accident, there."

Rita continued to stare at Carla, she didn't react to anything Carla was saying. Her eyes were glazed over, as though she was day-dreaming. 

"Do you have any....you know", began Carla. "Sanitary products ?"

Rita just kept looking at her with the same vacant, empty eyes. Her head was cocked to one side like a confused dog.

"How about that package, then ?", asked Carla tentatively.

Rita came back to reality.

"Ah yes. Of course. I shan't be a minute", she tittered politely.

After several minutes of waiting on the couch, Carla wandered into the kitchen to find Rita gazing at the wall. She seemed to be in some kind of trance. Her eyes were once again void of any expression. 

"Rita ?", she asked.

Suddenly Rita spun around revealing a kitchen knife and thrust it at Carla. Carla just caught Rita's wrist in time. Rita forced her to the ground and forced her hand towards Carla's neck.

Carla screamed out for help. She managed to force Rita's knife over to the side and she gathered her feet under Rita and pushed her away. Carla screamed out for help once again at the top of her lungs. Rita tried to slash at Carla's stomach.

"I WANT YOUR BABY !", screamed Rita. "I NEED IT !"
"I'm not fucking pregnant you psycho bitch !", yelled Carla. "HELP ME !"
"They're not gonna help you", spat Carla. "They all think you killed old Mrs.Kane."
"What ? I didn't kill her."
"You left her there to die."
"I went to get my phone. Is that what everyone thinks ?"

Suddenly Rita fell off of Carla. Her face went blank again and she stared emptily at Carla. Carla sprinted out of the apartment and hopped in her car. She drove straight to the police.

After several interview with the cops, Carla had given them an accurate idea of what Rita looked like and there was a cop car dispatched while she waited in the police station. After only a couple of minutes, Carla was called back into the interrigation room they were using. She walked in.

"Have you got her already ?", asked Carla.
"No, we haven't heard from them yet but we want to talk to you about a crime you may have committed."
"What ?", asked Carla, in shock. "Me ?"
"Yes. Ms.Mouer, do you realise that by not responding to an emergency that endangers a person's life immediately, you are partly responsible for their demise ?"
"What ? You mean Mrs.Kane ?"
"Yes, we've had reports from various other tenants describing you fleeing the scene upon Mrs.Kane suffering the mysterious ailment which doctors cannot seem to diagnose. This has led us to believe you were in fact responsible for her death."
"No, no.....", began Carla.

The cop shoved a phone in her face. It was playing a video of Carla sprinting out from Mrs.Kane's office.

"I wasn't running away, I was running back to my apartment to get my phone to call an ambulance", explained Carla. 
"Then why weren't you the one to call the ambulance ? We've looked at the records and they show another tenant calling the ambulance."
"Because, I went back downstairs, about to call an ambulance before seeing that someone already had. Before me."
"And why hadn't you called one from your apartment ?"
"I don't know, I was in shock, for Christ's sake."
"There's no need to get hostile, mam."
"I'm not getting hostile, I'm getting interrogated for a vague kinda sorta crimish thing, immediately after getting attacked and nearly murdered by some lunatic who lives below me !"

After hours of waiting while the police interrogated Rita after they caught her trying to escape the apartment building in Mrs.Kane's car, Carla was finally allowed to go home. It dark by the time she got back.

She flopped down on her bed, shaking from the days horrific events. She looked up therapists in her phone just as a message from the guy she met online popped up.

'Wanna meet up tonite ?', it read.

She thought about it. She nearly immediately typed no but then thought it would probably be better to be around people tonight, rather than being alone in her empty apartment. She agreed and sent him her address.

She slapped on some makeup and put on one of the only dresses she hadn't sold for rent money. She washed her blondey brown hair and slipped on a pair of heels. She looked at her phone. It was the guy. He was outside.

She gladly left the apartment and walked outside to the shiny, black jeep that was waiting on the curb. She looked in the window and saw that the drivers seat was empty. The engine was still running and the drivers door was open. She jumped when she got a message alert on her phone. She relaxed when she saw that it was him.

She opened the message to find a picture of her standing in front of the jeep, taken from behind. She turned around just in time to see a man dressed in a full clown costume bounding at her. Before she could scream, he slapped a cloth saturated in chloroform over her mouth and nose. She forced her into the back of the jeep until she subsided and stopped struggling.

Carla awoke. She was in some kind of warehouse, God knows where. She opened her eyes to find the clown sitting opposite her. She screamed at the sight of him. He had wild, wiry, stringy hair, poorly dyed purple. He had white makeup all over his face and streams of black eyeliner encrusted to his cheeks. He had orange lipstick smeared all over the bottom half of his face. He wore an old fashioned clown outfit. He shifted excitedly in his chair. He turned on the lamp on the table separating the two. 

Upon him turning on the light, Carla saw a human torso laying on the table. It seemed relatively fresh. Carla screamed and cried. There was a deep slit in the pale, skinny torso. The gash was open and was full of maggots and cockroaches. The clown dug his hand into the torso and pulled out what appeared to be a lung.

The clown opened his mouth and sunk his black and yellow teeth into the lung, and ripped off a chunk. More cockroaches streamed out of the lung. The clown licked the roaches off with his browning tongue and cheerily munched them too, blood dripping down his chin. Carla nearly fainted and eventually puked all over her shoes.

She looked up and saw several human eyeballs, hanging by the optic nerves from a bar above the table. She continued to cry for help. The clown noticed her and pulled an eyeball from the bar and gently tapped the eye on Carla's screaming face, leaving wet marks on her cheeks as it slapped wetly on her.

Carla cried desperately

The Director grinned widely as he watched Carla's terrified face on the multiple screens in front of him. He folded his arms. This was gonna be huge. </TEXT>

Grace screamed as the knife pierced her skin and she lashed out her high heeled foot and caught Elanora in the eye. Elanora shrieked in frustration and fell back. Grace lunged towards the door and stumbled out into the hallway. She slammed the door behind her and pushed the maid's cart in front of the door to slow Elanora down. She ran down the hall and struggled up the stairs. 

Elanora lay in her room, unconscious. She had knocked her head on the corner of the table and collapsed onto the floor.

The next day, at dawn, Constance woke up to find Elanora looming over her bed.

"Jesus Christ, what are you doing ?", asked Constance.
"I need your help", she pleaded.
"With what ?"
"Come with me."

Elanora led Constance to her bedroom where Grace had escaped.

"What am I looking at ?", inquired Constance sleepily. 
"Last night I invited Grace in here to ask something of her. A favour. Anyway as I was about to tell her the rules, she told me knew what I do to the guests that stay here. And she shot me. Three times. After I got back up I managed to stab her but she knocked me unconscious and I just woke up now. Do you know what that means ? We have a guest who knows our secret on the loose and someone else knows and told her."
"Our secret ? This is your secret, Elanora."

Elanora's face turned sour. 

"This is our problem. Both of us", she said quietly. "You have just as much to do with this as I do. You're the one who did the voodoo shit in the first place."
"Because you threatened to kill me."
"Listen, Constance", sighed Elanora. "We need to do something about this. We need to find and kill Grace. And then we need to find whoever told her about this."
"Well how are we gonna do that ?" asked Constance.
"Time to get out your couldron and broomstick, witch."
"That's technically racist."

Several minutes later Elanora and Constance were standing in the second floor corridor. Constance was flipping through an old, leather book.

"Find anything ?", asked Elanora. "We need some kind of detection."
"I can't seem to find anything that I'm capable of. There isn't exactly a whole catalogue of options in here."
"Come one, you brought me back from the dead with that thing. There's gotta be something."
"Okay, here. There's a hex where I'd be able to basically booby trap the hotel, but we need some kind of trigger specific to Grace."
"Okay...... well can it detect what she looks like or her clothes or something ?"
"No, it has to be simpler than that. So if she's bleeding and in pain, then maybe we can use sound as a trigger. If someone screams above a certain decible, it'll trigger it."
"Is that it ?"
"It's the best I can do."
"Fine", sighed Elanora, taking a set of long metal blades out of a bag.

Constance incanted something unintelligable and a small, rectangular slot opened in the wall next to them. Elanora slid the blade in and the slot closed up.

"Okay", said Constance. "The next time someone screams loud enough, they'll be sorry they did."

They did the same around the other corridors of the motel. 

At around two, Cordelia came stumbling back in the doorway and headed towards her room. Eve, meanwhile was going the book she'd found the previous night. Every guest since the motel had opened twenty years earlier had been murdered by her aunt and stored in the basement. Her aunt was a serial killer and she couldn't go to anyone. She couldn't go to Dennis in case he was in on it and she couldn't go to Linda because she was criminal and couldn't trust her and she couldn't go to her mother because she was always incapacitated with alcohol. She decided she needed to take matters into her own hands. She decided she needed to see what was in room 29.

Cordelia fell into the room just then and flopped onto her bed and curled up, falling asleep. She lay there, thankful for the peaceful darkness alcohol lended her.

Cordelia awoke suddenly. It was six o'clock. Her black out blinds seemed to be working as she couldn't see anything in her room. She felt as though someone was present in the room. She looked up and barely made out the figure of Kitty, the maid. Cordelia moved out of the way just in time to avoid the axe that Kitty was holding. 

Cordelia rolled off the bed as Kitty embedded the axe into her pillow. Cordelia screamed and ran out of the room. She ran down the corridor and up the stairs to the second floor. Kitty pushed her from behind and they both fell onto the floor. Kitty raised the axe above her head and brought it down. Cordelia blocked it by pushing the handle of the axe towards her.

"You stole my finacee you bitch !", shouted Kitty.

Cordelia's face went white. 

"Katie McClure ?", she whispered.
"Of course it's fucking me you idiot ! You know I didn't think that dying my hair red and some botox would fool anybody but apparently it makes all the fucking difference."

Cordelia pushed the axe to the side and crawled backwards. 

"You stole my fiancee and then you let him die ! You let him die you asshole !", shrieked Katie.

Cordelia got up and ran back towards the stairs back down to her room. Katie got and screamed.

"YOU'LL FUCKING PAY YOU BITCH !", she screamed, running at Cordelia as two blades came out of the wall and sliced her head clean off, sending a wave of blood back down the corridor. Cordelia continued down the stairs, without seeing the decapitation.

Cordelia climbed into her bed after locking all the doors and took several sips of whiskey before drifting off.

Grace sat on the roof of the Motel DeMille. She had stuffed a towel she'd found on the maid's cart over her wound, but it was already saturated. She sat against a vent, looking at the sunset. This was gonna be a long, long night. </TEXT>

Elanora and Constance stood over the body. The teenager lay there, with a fire poker sticking out of his chest.

"We have to get this cleaned up. And quick", said Elanora to Constance.
"Jesus, Elanora. I thought we agreed you'd never kill kids", said Constance disapprovingly.
"He came in here. I told them what would happen if they did that. Now hook him up to my corpse and put the other body down with the others. I think he's all dried up."

Constance waved her hand and the body that was currently attatched to Elanora's corpse floated across the room and was dropped down the hole in the floor that led straight to the basement. She waved her hand again and Peter's body floated over to the table next to the one on which Elanora's corpse lay. The tube pierced and entered his arm and began to draw blood into Elanora's body.

"There", said Constance. "That should do it for about four days or so."

Hours later, Cordelia woke up. It was eight o'clock. She decided to head out again. She grabbed her bottle of Jack Daniels and sprayed some deoderant over her. She didn't bother changing her clothes or showering. She grabbed her bag and sauntered downstairs and into the lobby.

She called a cab and was on her way into town. She found a busy looking bar and settled herself on a bar stool. She ordered a screwdriver and waited for someone to notice her. She waited until a shady looking man sat down beside her. He had facial hair covering most of his features and it seemed to be travelling down his neck and onto his chest also. He had injection marks in his arms and a white substance on his nose.

"Hey baby", he slurred.
"Yeah, hi", sighed Cordelia.
"Can I order you a drink ?", asked the man.
"Let's just cut the shit", said Cordelia. "Come on."

She took the man's hand and led him to the car park.

"Which one's your car ?", she asked.

He clumsily pressed his car key and a car beeped.

"Let's go to your place", said Cordelia.

After a few minutes of dangerously drunk driving, Cordelia found herself in a damp, smelly apartment with a toilet in the kitchen. He led her into his bedroom, which was just barely big enough for them both to stand in.

Cordelia told him she was going to freshen up. She went to his shitty bathroom and began to apply make up. She looked at herself. She had an alcohol stained dress that was several sizes too small and covered far too little. She was away from her family. She was in some low life druggie's three room apartment. She laughed at herself. How had her life gotten so awful ? She knew of course. Ever since her husband died, the only thing to keep the demons at bay was the bitter sweet taste of alcohol. She began to cry.

She smeared the navy lipstick all over her cheeks and chin. Her tears caused streams of mascara to stain the rest of her face. She looked like a very dishevelled clown. The man walked in and she turned around.

"You still wanna fuck me ?", she asked, smiling. She knew only the scummiest dirtbags would still want to have sex with her in this state. He grabbed her hand and led her into the bedroom. Of course he did. They always did.

Eve came down to the lobby after deciding to look for clues as to what Elanora was doing. The lobby was empty. She tip toed across it and jumped when Linda appeared behind her.

"Have you seen Peter anywhere, Eve ?", she asked.
"Uh, not since this morning", replied Eve quickly.
"Okay", sighed. "Let me know if you see him."
"Will do."

When Linda was gone, Eve searched behind Constance's desk. She found a metal, locked box. She lifted it up onto the desk. In the middle of the rack with all the room keys on it was a small key with no number. Eve tried it and the box popped open. Inside was a large book.

Eve opened it and read. In it was the name and check in date of every guest in the hotel. Beside that was another date. It said date of "departure" and beside it was a method of death. Axe wound. Stabbing. Gunshot. Throat slashed. Every single guest since the hotel opened twenty one years prior. 

On the latest slot was Linda's, Peter's and Grace Wilkinson's name. None of them had any "departure dates" beside them except Peter. It said that day's date and wound to the chest beside. Eve went pale.

Grace Wilkinson sauntered down the corridor to her room, before running into Elanora.

"Grace ! Just the person I wanted to see. How about having a drink in my room ?", tittered Elanora.
"It would be my pleasure", smiled Grace.

Grace sat at the extravagant tea table in Elanora's room. Elanora served the drinks and sat down.

"So, Grace. Do you remember the rules I told you about on the telephone ?", she asked.
"Of course, yes. May I ask if these rooms are sound proof ?"
"As a matter of fact, yes. Each room is nearly completely sound insulated."
"Great. I recall you telling me that you had a proposition for me ?"
"Ah yes. I have an opportunity for you. It's very simple. Given that I have to run this motel constantly, I rarely get enough time to go out. I want you to go to  the nearest shop available and purchase me some.......items. I have a list. I will provide you with a sufficient fund and a handsome fee for doing the job."
"I'm afraid I must decline."
"And why's that ?", asked Elanora.
"Because, what am I going to do with a handsome fee when I'm dead ?"

Elanora looked shocked.

"I recently received some information about certain morbid fates that the guests here succumb to."

Elanora was taken aback. Just then, Grace pulled out a pistol and shot Elanora three times in the chest.

Elanora stood up, the three black holes in her chest closing up.  Grace looked horrified. Grace tried to run but Elanora took out a kitchen knife and thrust it into Grace's side. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Secondary school is bullshit. There literally isn't any other place on earth that's filled to the brim with the type of immature people in our school. The same goes for a lot of the girls our age. Eventually as you age, so will the other people our age. They'll possibly mature. Some won't. Some will realise they were stupid assholes in secondary school. Some won't. Just wait Secondary school out. If you were a care free brainless stoner you'd probably have a good time for the six years in school and then regret it for the rest of your life. Also even if you were going out and getting stoned, I doubt you'd enjoy the company..... I sure af wouldn't. You'll find someone subtle someday, and if it is after secondary school, who cares ? G'luck Manus


P.s next time you see that girl you should just drop a hearty "go fuck yourself" at her </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Changing - Part 3 </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/65iuh1/the_changing_part_1/) 

[Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/65r7zw/the_changing_part_2/) 

I awaken in the Shardstake's basement. It's been converted into some kind of mini cinema. It has about twenty old, red seats in rows. I'm sitting, tied to the middlemost chair in the front row. All the other seats are occupied by dead bodies. Some of them are already skeletal, some are still decomposing. The smell stings my eyes. I am determined not to throw up. My head throbs with pain in the bump that Benny gave me when he knocked me unconscious earlier. 

I look around and see that there are bodies sitting upright against the walls also. I hear the door creak open and Penny comes over to me. She begins tightening the leather straps that are restraining my hands and feet.

"W-why are you d-doing this ?", I stutter.


She laughs in my face.

"You people.....", she sighs.
"What's happening to my wife ? What did you do to her ?"
"Do to her ?", asks Penny innocently. "Why I didn't do anything to her. It's The Changing."
"The Changing ?", I ask. "What the fuck is The Changing ?"
"It's the most beautiful phenomenon in human history. As far as we know, Frank and I were the first and only ones to ever experience The Changing. Until we had children, of course. To be short, The Changing is when a person, Frank, Benny, myself and now Belle, is completely normal, fits into society perfectly and lives a normal, boring, meaningless life until one day, over night, a series of Changes occur for a couple of days, and when that period is over, they come out of it as the same person, except they see things clearer now. They realise that human life isn't as precious as we previously thought, that most humans are worthless, irrelevant and ultimately, dangerous. That they are arrogant, self serving vultures that pollute the earth, cross one another for personal gain and manipulate fellow humans. That they deserve to be wiped out. And that they should suffer whilst doing it."
"So you turn into insane, preachy fucking sociopaths ?", I spit at her.

She cackles once again.

"Typical human answer. You would cast us aside, dismiss us as being sick or degenerates, whereas, in reality, we're the next step in evolution. We're more evolved than you people can be expected to comprehend. We can see past emotion, we don't need love, compassion, happiness or human connection. We're the next step in the evolutionary chain. We are superior to you people."
"So you don't even love your own children ?"
"Not anymore. Not after The Changing. We guide them until The Changing takes them. That's what's happening to Belle. She's a little later than the rest of us. For Frank and I, we both Changed at twenty five and Benny Changed at sixteen. We were so proud of him. And now Belle is the latest at twenty nine. Unfortunately there aren't any other of The Changed other than the four of us but, we suspect that if both Benny and Belle mate with regular people, their offsprings will inherit The Changing gene. Also, Frank can still reproduce if needs be. Then if we exterminate enough regulars, we can repopulate with a flawless society of The Changed. If Changed people populated the earth, there would be no wars, famine, hunger or terrorism. There'd be a functional, non emotional efficient society."
"So you're going to single handedly off every single other person on this planet ? Six billion people ?"
"Well no, not everyone obviously. We'll keep going at our pace until our people grow into a sufficient army to take on the remaining regulars."
"You're gonna go to war with the human race ? Haven't you learned that that's really not a good fucking idea by now ?"
"They've never went to war with us. And with bigger numbers, they'll have no chance."

Now it's my turn to laugh. Despite all the fear and pain and anxiety I've felt over the last few hours since Belle's family revealed themselves to be psychos, I still find all this dystopian shit completely ludicrous.

"So why haven't you killed me ?", I ask.
"Why haven't I killed you ?"
"Yeah, why haven't you rid the world of another 'inferior being' ?"
"Well, since Belle is the one who brought you here, we feel she deserves to be the one to do it. Plus, we'd like to keep an eye on her during her first kill and you're...... handy."
"I'm glad I'm so convenient."
"She's still in the transitional period so she's still rather erratic. You'll have to wait a while."
"Oh goody."

I wait, surrounded by the dead bodies, on edge from pure fear, for death. I jump when I hear someone coming down the steps into the basement. It's Benny, with his gormless face and signature metal bat. He shuffles in.

"She's nearly Changed. I gotta bring you up and prepare you. The less you struggle the less it's gonna hurt."

 He releases me from the leather straps. He rests his bat on the body in the seat next to me. He lifts me over his shoulder with surprising strength. He turns around so that I'm facing the bat. Now's my chance. I take the heavy bat, knee Benny in the groin and whack him in the head with the bat, knocking him unconscious. 

I sprint up the steps and race around the confusing hallways of the huge house and eventually find a door. The bat slips from my grasp as I rush past the pool, realising it was the back door. I run towards the fence, hoping the adrenaline will help me get over the top. 

Just as I reach my hand out for the fence, a pair of arms wrap around me and the world tilts for a disorientating second and I crash to the ground. It's Frank. He gets up and dives at me savagely. I kick him in the stomach, scramble up and run back toward the house. The back door is shut. I run along the back of the house and get to a large, floor to ceiling window of the sun room. I turn around just in time to see Frank bounding at me like a rabid dog. He crashes straight into me and I fall through the plate-glass window back into the house.

I wake up in the living room where Belle is tied up in her armchair. I too am bound in an armchair. I have a leather strap around my mouth also, preventing me from making any sound. She is facing away from me. I guess one of the shards cut my head when I fell through the window as there's dry blood down the side of my face. 

I look out the window. It's dusk. Frank and Penny are out on the front lawn chatting to a concerned looking neighbour. They probably heard me falling through the window. Penny and Frank are laughing and charming the neighbour. They're acting like regular, neighbourly rich folks with a happy family. I find it mind-blowing how much that neighbour's perception of this household is probably so unbelievably wrong. Little do they know of the horrific skeletons in the fucked up closet of the Shardstakes.

I try to scream, to attempt to alert the neighbour, but hardly any sound escapes the leather strap. Benny comes over and gently thumps my head when I make the noise. The pain the gently tap causes is searing and blinding. Pulsing, white hot pain throbs through my head.

I sit here, impossibly frightened. I've been in constant fear and extreme anxiety for almost the whole day and my bones, muscles and nerves are beginning to ache from it. I didn't think it was possible to be in such a state of heightened fear for so long. I realise something as I sit here. Hell does exist. It isn't a big fire and brimstone firey landscape full of tortured souls. It exists on earth. In small, condensed spaces and it only exists for a small number of desperately unfortunate individuals. I am one of those individuals. And Hell isn't a grand place where the devil rules. It's disguised as a happy, sunny, wealthy suburban paradise where a functional family live.

I think to myself how I got myself into possibly the only place where hell is a reality on earth. It's not war, where people are forced to kill for their country. It's not inside a terrorist camp where people are brainwashed into killing for a cause. It's in a house where the people don't kill for a cause. They kill because they are pure evil. Pure evil people who will not relent in torturing me or any of the previous victims lured into this micro chasm of pure terror. I think to myself how few times a human has been so afraid for so long. After a while, even in the direst situations, fear fades. But somehow, in this suburban Hell, I have been afraid for almost a day and my body can't take much more of it. So, yeah, Hell exists in a small situation where a person is forced to endure the most horrific experience possible. And I am that fucking person.

I begin to cry. Not even for me. For the time when I lived with my wife. My real wife before any of this shit happened to her. The chances are, I probably will never see her again.

Penny and Frank come back inside. Penny kneels down in front of Belle. 

"She's sleeping", says Penny. "She should be ready soon. Bring him into the room, Benny."

Benny complies and drags the armchair I am bound to down a hallway, past the kitchen and into a room I've been into before. The room is small with padlocked cupboards all around. There is a metal table in the centre of the room with similar leather straps to my armchair. There is a smaller table beside that with an assortment of knives on it.

Benny unstraps my straps and goes to lift me again. I kick him in the stomach, sending him flying backwards into the table of knives. The knives spill everywhere and Benny gets back up and swings his bat. I duck, grabbing a large looking knife.

Benny clumsily swings his bat again. Again, I duck and when his head is ducked down I jam my knife into his skull. I hear the steel breaking through the bone in his skull with a sickening crack. Benny slowly and calmly stands up, the handle of the knife sticking out of the top of his head.

For a second he seems calm, as if nothing happened. Then he sticks out his arms and backs me against the wall. A small stream of blood runs down his face. His fingers wrap around my throat and begin to tighten. I close my eyes. His grip isn't tightening. I look at him as a sheet of flowing blood covers his whole face, he can't see. He spits out mouthfuls of warm, sticky blood onto my face as it goes in his mouth. His clothes are saturated in it now and a pool is collecting on the ground. His body goes stiff as a board and he slowly tips over onto the floor.

I slide down the wall breathing heavily. I can't believe I just did that. He's gone. He was here a second ago and now he's gone forever. Because of me. I begin to hyperventilate. I sit here in the cold room and, before I know it, there's a layer of blood covering the whole floor of the room. I stand up but slip, getting blood all over my clothes. I nearly faint, but I will myself to stay awake. I puke.

After vomiting, I stumble out of the room and down the hall. I find myself in the same living room. It's just Penny standing there. Belle is gone. I stand in front a coffee table and see a butcher knife. I kick myself for not notcing how many knives were left laying around before. I spot the handgun Belle had this morning.

I look at Penny. She is closer to it. She rushes for it and as her fingers grasp it I bring the butcher knife down on her wrist. Blood spews all over her face as she howls in pain. I bring it down again, cutting through bone this time. I bring it down a third time and she falls back, flailing. I step back and look at the severed hand. I drop the knife, horrified. Penny is  screaming in pain on the floor. He left arm ends in a stump which is spraying blood at a dangerous rate.

She looks at me with woeful disdain.

"You know it's no one's fault but your own", I say.

I run down another hallway in the confusing mansion and I think I hear an engine. I hope to God it's the police. Suddenly, Frank bursts through a door opposite me, wielding a chainsaw. He rushed at me and I barely dodge his heavy handed swipe at me. He misses, tearing the family photos on the table behind me to shreds. I run upstairs. He chases me, growling. When I get to the top I turn and as he pulls the chainsaw back, I kick the handle, causing him to drop it down the stairs, breaking it. 

He lunges at me and scrabs me with his nails. I punch him and sprint back downstairs. He follows. I run into the sunroom, where he pushed me through the window. Frank gains on me and knocks me onto the floor, which is still full of glass. I grab the biggest shard I can find. He pulls a knife out from his pocket and slashes at me. I duck and run in a random direction. I find myself going upstairs again. I run through the maze of the second floor hallways and pick a random room. I run into it. It's a bedroom. I run out onto the balcony. 

Frank swipes at me as I turn around. I just about dodge it and shove the shard of glass I have into his eye. He screams in terror as blood runs down his cheek. I step back and kick the glass in further, silencing him. He goes limp, his body toppling over the balcony and falling into the pool and sinks to the bottom, turning the water red.

I stumble back, hardly believing what I just had to do. My vision goes blurry and then black. I panic for a moment before my sight comes back. I stumble downstairs, exhausted. I go into another living room. I hear someone coming at me from behind. It's Penny. She rushed at me, pushing me into a framed picture on the wall, headfirst. The glass frame shatters as my head hits it and blinding pain courses through my head, but it's not as unbearable as when I went through the window.

Penny scrambles up, she has some kind of cloth around the bloody stump. She gets up but I kick her in the stomach, winding her. She flies back as I run down another hallway. I run into the dining room. Belle is standing in front of me and, before I know it, she knocks me to the ground and start punching my face. She grabs at my neck and wraps her hand hands around it. She chokes me again. I see a rack of china plates beside me. I reach and grab one, and smash it over her head. She falls over, unconscious. I get up, limping, wheezing and coughing.  I wander around and see the patio. 

I see my coat hanging beside it.  My coat. With my phone in it. I run to it and take out my phone. I go out into the back garden, feeling the cool night air on my face. I ring 911.

"Hello this is 911, what's your emergency", chirps the operator.
"Please, help me", I cry. "I'm in the Shardstake house on Greenleaf avenue. Please you have to help they're trying to kill me", I scream.
"Okay, sir. Wha-", the phone gets cut off.

I look at the screen. It says low battery and powers off. I try to turn it back on. No dice.

"FUCK !", I scream in anger, throwing my phone in the pool, which was now full of red water.

I think I hear the garage door opening. I turn around and I'm blinded by a set headlights in the garage. They start speeding towards me. It's Penny in the Range Rover. I fall out of the way and the Range Rover speeds past me and past the pool and crashes into the wall with a deafening crash.

I walk over the car, hoping Penny is dead or unconscious. I look at the car. The whole windscreen has shattered. There is a small pool of blood collecting on the mutilated bonnet. Penny is sitting in the drivers seat with her head down, eyes closed. There's dozens of jagged shards of glass piercing her chest and arms and her stump has begun bleeding again.

Suddenly, Penny jerks awake and falls out of the car, splashing blood about. She tries to get up of the ground, but can't. She lies there, bleeding and unable to get up. She pulls a long shard of glass out of her jaw with a blood curdling scream. 

"Fuck you", she says. "I could've made this world great. I could've evolved this whole planet but you had fuck it all up didn't you ? You self righteous, selfish BASTARD !"
"You were never going to be able to take on the human race. You may see emotion as a weakness but we don't. We see it as a strength you don't have."
"Oh fuck you, you small minded prick. You know we would have made a great society but you didn't want to get a little hurt. You didn't want to experience pain so you did what all humans do. You did what you wanted despite the all the plans and ideas you'd be shitting on. You ruined everything."
"I didn't ruin anything. I rid the world of evil, ruthless serial killers who have no qualms about ending human lives."
"You just ended two human lives, you hypocrite !"
"I did it so the innocent people you would've killed in the future could live."
"It doesn't matter, anyway. Belle is newly Changed and young and strong and she'll rip you apart."
"Maybe I don't care if I get ripped apart. Maybe I don't car as long as you people are out of it. If Belle does kill me, which I hope she fucking does, she'll be locked away for the rest of her life."
"The police would never figure it out in time. She'll have all this cleaned up by tomorrow."
"Not unless someone rang them telling them that the Shardstakes are murdering people."
"You didn't."
"You can fucking bet I did, bitch."

Just then she manages to get up and she weakly thrusts the shard of glass she has at me. I block it easily, grabbing the one wrist she has left. She is wobbling as I am holding her. I let go of her wrist and she collapses into the pool, the red water enveloping her as she sinks to the bottom. She doesn't even resist as the last few bubbles of air rise to the surface.

I go back inside and try to get to the front of the house. I take a turn and end up in one of the kitchens. Belle is there cowering in the corner. She is crying loudly and looking confused. My heart flutters as I go over to her.

"Belle, sweetie ?", I ask gently.
"Phil", she cries. "What happened ? What's going on ? Why is this happening to me ?"
"It's okay", I say, helping her up. "We can go home now."

I put my arm around her, helping her up and then she stops crying. She looks into my eyes and smiles that evil grin. She reveals a knife and plunges it into my shoulder. I scream in pain as the metal pierces my skin and gets jammed in my bone.

I fall to the floor, screaming. The pain is making my thoughts cloudy. I can't think straight. I crawl across the kitchen, bleeding. I can't believe how horrific the last day has been. I can't believe I walked straight into this Hell, completely obliviously. Not only have I been subjected to the depths of bad human experiences, I walked into it willingly and ignorantly. 

I long for a time when I thought having a problem was not paying my gas bill. I miss the time when I lived with my mom in her apartment, in my own little bubble. Before I knew pain like this even existed. Before I knew fear or evil like this existed, back when I had enough blind faith in the human race to think that horrors like this never would happen. I want to go back to when I lived with my mom and appreciated the small things like a nice day or finding a dollar on the street.

The sweet sound of hope echoes in my mind. I have to survive this. Even if there's a chance, a tiny, tiny chance that I can experience that carefree, simple, boring ass life where I'd go to work and come home and complain about it, a chance at returning to normality and feeling that even once more, I have to take it. I have to survive.

Belle is giggling, choosing a weapon with which to end me. I crawl out of the kitchen and toward the front door. I hear Belle load a gun. She comes out into the hallway and points a large shotgun at me. She fires off a round and misses me completely, blowing a hole in the front door. The recoil alone sends her flying backwards. 

I hear sirens as I crawl down the front steps. I see my car. I crawl over to it and hide behind it. Belle comes out onto the porch and loads the gun again. She fires off another round, causing a window in my car to explode. She fires again blowing a hole beside me in the car. Suddenly, three police cars speed up the driveway. Several police officers get out and point there handguns at Belle. They look at me, bleeding and broken with a knife stuck in me.

"Drop the gun, mam", shout the cops.


I look at Belle. Her face contorts in irritance and anger. She grows contrary and shoots at the cops, catching one of them in the arm. The rest of the cops open fire on Belle, the bullets ripping her apart.

I'm sitting next to my mother in the police station. She's holding me. I survived. Holy shit, I actually survived. My mother tells me it's been nearly two days since the "incident". She says for the last two days I've just been going between catatonia, crying hysterically and blacking out. I can't recall any of that. Last thing I remember is bleeding out behind my car while Belle faced off with the cops.

My arm and shoulder is in a cast and I have band aids all over my head. The rest of today consists of police interrogations, court appearances and therapy. They tell me I'm going to have to go to therapy every day for a while. I do one "exclusive interview with the survivor of the Shardstake Massacre" before going back to therapy. I tell the therapist the whole story, leaving out no details. I can see her trying to hide the shock and terror as she hears the things I've been through. I don't blame her. No person should have to endure the things I've seen.

As the day comes to a close, I realise I'm still afraid. It's a different kind of fear, though. It's one that will fade. I'm not scared because of all the shit I've been through and seen or the things I had to do to survive. I'm afraid because of something else. Something far more terrible, sinister and incurable. I feel myself beginning to Change. </TEXT>

[Part 3](http://ww.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/662fxc/the_changing_part_3/) 

I drive to the doctors and look at her. Her long, black, silky hair becoming wiry from the dried blood. Her big, blue eyes wet with tears. I almost think that her waking up is the worst part because of the distress it causes her. She gets so upset. I remember being trapped in my bedroom for what felt like hours. I waited for her to start crying before coming out. I just couldn't risk waking her myself. 

"What did I do ?", she cries, ashamed. "Is this the hamster's blood ?"
"Yeah, yeah it's the hamster's", I lied, not telling her about the rabbit.
"I can't believe I did that, I'm so sorry. We can bury him when we get back."
"Sure, yeah fine", I say, distracted. 
"Where did the axe come from ?", she asks me.

I'd been hoping to avoid this question. 

"You just found it and started waving it around, that's all."
"Oh my God, I could've killed you", she gasped.
"No, no, course you couldn't", I lie, knowing full well that she nearly out and out murdered me this morning.

We arrive at the doctors and wait in the waiting area. I look at her again. She has stopped crying and is staring straight ahead at the wall. Her posture is unusually perfect. I realise she's starting to slip back.

"You alright there, Belle ?", I ask timidly.

No answer. I hold her hand. No response. Her eyes are glazed over. I know it's only a matter of time.

"Belle ? You okay ?", I ask again, squeezing her hand.

She mumbles something in reply. Okay, that's a good sign. It means there's still enough time to get her into the doctor. All of a sudden, the doctor walks in.

"Okay", he smiled. "I can see you now, Ms.Quinn."

Belle stands up slowly and walks in, back straight, no expression. 

"Should I go in too ?", I ask.
"No, I think I'll be okay", chuckles the doctor.

Minutes pass. I shift uncomfortably in my seat and check my watch constantly. Ten minutes. I get some water. Twenty minutes. I pace up and down. At the thirty minute mark, the doctor comes back out. His face is snow white and he is shaking slightly. He walks up to me.

"Your wife will be fine", he says with a wary look in his eye. "No treatment is necessary."
"Well what happened ?", I ask. "What's wrong with her ?"
"Nothing. Absolutely nothing", he says, literally pushing me and Belle out the door.
"Wait, what happened ? I nee-", I start to say but he slams the door shut and locks it. He pulls down all the blinds in his office.

I walk, deflated back to the car. I slump in my seat as Belle climbs in, eerie and vacant as ever. She is still dead-eyed. What the fuck am I supposed to do now ?  I decide to take her to her parents house. Whatever is happening, I hope they have some information, or at least be able to calm her down a bit.

I start the journey to the suburbs, where her parents owned what was basically a mansion. It was a stylish, three story house with a pool and an indoor hot tub and acres of land and a garage full of expensive cars. Her parents were the some of the nicest people I know, but I never liked going there because I always get this weird feeling that they're judging me because being a teacher will never allow me to make enough money to live their lavish, wealthy lifestyle.

But this, of course, is a special circumstance. Belle falls asleep almost immediately. I drive for a little under an hour before I reach the rich part of the suburbs. I drive past tall, meticulously clipped hedges covering the undoubtedly expensive abodes. I arrive at her parents gates and open them. I get back in my car and Belle's awake. The driveway is long and winding, with small forests of tall trees on either side. I drive down the little track as Belle begins to murmur.

"Fuck you", she says.
"I know that's not you Belle, try to fight it. We nearly there."
"I never loved you, you fuckwit", she laughs evilly.
"I'm not listening to you."
"You think you're so important, so caring and kind, looking after you're crazy wife. But you're just like all the rest of them. Put up with me for show and feed your ego and then dump me on my parent's doorstep like a stray fucking dog."
"I'm not dumping you-"
"Sure your not, you small minded dick stain. I bet you think 'all life is precious and everyone deserves equality' like some dim bulb fucking hippie. You think you're open minded and kind and a goddamn samaritan, but you're just a phoney fucking spineless dickhole just like the rest of them."
"Belle, I don't know what's going through your head right now, and I can't imagine how tough it is, but if you can just fight this for a little longer-"

Suddenly, Belle reached over and yanked my steering wheel and we swerved and scraped the side of my car on one of the trees.

"Belle, fuck....no.....STOP !", I yell, pushing her back into her seat.

Eventually she subsides and sits still, staring at me with evil intensity. She twitches violently every so often and whispers profanities to herself. Finally, we reach the end of the seemingly endless driveway and the fancy house comes into view.

Belle's parents must've heard the car coming because they're coming out onto the porch as I climb out of my car. I catch a glimpse of their gardener snipping the hedge as I get out and realise I've never spoken to her. In fact I've never even seen her face before, just the back of her head.

Frank and Penny Shardstake stand on the porch with warm, welcoming smiles on their faces. Sometimes I think their lives are just too perfect. It's almost eerie. Frank, a stylish ex-lawyer, is wearing a blazer with a shirt and creased suit pants and shined shoes. He has short, cropped white hair and well groomed white facial hair to match. He is wearing his signature stylish, black glasses. Penny, a retired psychiatrist who had her own psychology based talk show, is a tall, hippieish woman with icy blue eyes and long, bushy brown hair and is always wearing some kind of flowy cardigan or shawl. 

"Phil", beams Penny. "What a nice surprise."
"How are you, Phil ?", asks Frank.

Just as I am about to greet them and explain, Belle rushes out of the car grabs me by the throat, rushing me towards the wall past Penny and Frank. She tightens her grip and begins to choke me. She looks into my eyes with deep, real hatred as my eyes water from the lack of air.

Frank and Penny grab her and pull her back into the house as I slide down the wall, recovering. I cough and splutter and gulp down sweet bursts of fresh oxygen. I stumble into the house and see Frank and Penny restraining Belle in a soft armchair that has buckles to restrain your wrists and ankles. I've never spent much time in this living room, but still, it strikes me as odd that I never noticed this before.

Penny comes over and dusts me off.

"Are you alright ?", asks Penny, concerned. "Are you hurt ?"

Penny feel around my face and neck for any injuries. She leaves her hands resting on my back for an uncomfortably long time.

"Oh my God, Phil. We're so sorry about this", apologises Frank.
"Wait, you knew about this ?", I inquire, confused.
"Why don't you sit down with us in the kitchen ?", asks Penny. "I'll make tea."


I sit down as Penny boils the kettle. Belle's brother, Benny, who lives with his parents despite being thirty five, stares at me intently. He has always made me uncomfortable. He wears only army print clothes despite never being in the military, he always smelled of sweat, he had long, scraggly hair, never smiled and always carried a metallic baseball bat on his shoulder wherever he goes. I've actually never seen him without. He has never liked me and has made no secret of it. I tried to get along with him initially but I gave up after a while. I always wonder how Penny, Frank and Belle (for the most part) have turned out so well and Benny turned out like this.

He walks past me, making some kind of intimidating expression. I relax as he exits the room.

"So, has this happened before ?", I ask.
"Well, yes", admitted Frank. "But not since she was little."
"Well what happened when she was little ?"

Penny sits serves us mugs of tea and sits down.

"When Belle was around seven or eight, she began to act out in increasingly violent ways. It got to the point where  we were getting worried for our own safety as well as her's. She began to show signs of psychopathic and sociopathic tendencies. That's why we have the restrainment chairs, she used to get out of control and dangerous. So I did some treatment on her and it seemed to work. She doesn't even remember it", states Penny.
"Well, whatever it is, it's back. But it's only coming in bursts. Every so often, she would......sort of change. And do increasingly terrible things. And then, after a while, go back to her normal self and have no recollection of it", I say.
"Yes, well that's new. But not surprising, I've heard that happen on many occasions before. I'll do some research, and do some treatment with her", says Penny.
"I'm sorry for bringing her here, but I had no other choice. I.....she tried to......attack me this morning", I admit.
"No", says Frank. "You did the right thing. Thank you. And I want you to stay here for as long as you need."
"Has it gotten worse over time ?", asks Penny.
"Yeah, it usually only lasts about twenty minutes but she's been like this for over two hours now, I'm starting to get worried", I say.
"Don't you worry, Phil. It's okay now, you can relax", smiled Penny. "Why don't you boys go have a beer in the big sitting room while I talk to Belle ?"
"Sure", I say, finally relaxing.

Minutes later I'm sitting on an overly expensive sofa drinking a beer.

"So, Phil", smiles Frank. "How's the teaching going ?"
"Ah, yeah, it's going fine. I've been promoted to vice principal, actually."

I think I see Frank rolling his eyes, but I look up and he's still holding that warm smile.

"Well that's great", he says. "So, about Belle. That's gotta be pretty tough, huh ?"
"Yeah, well it's just kinda scary, is all."
"Well, I don't mean to pry, but, ah I've heard that symptoms such as the ones Belle is dealing with here, can be caused by extremely stressful environments. You aren't beating her or anything, are ya ?", he chuckles heartily.

I laugh nervously at this off colour joke he's just made about his sick daughter.

"You aren't, though, are you ?", he says with a stern expression. "Because if you are, I'll kill you. And I mean that literally. And don't think I can't because I'm nearly sixty, because, boy, can I do it. I'll rip your fucking skin off", he snarls.

I sit back, shell shocked. He bursts into the laughter. He loses his breathe from this apparently hilarious situation.

"I'm just kidding around", he says through his laughs. "You know I'd never think that."
"Yeah", I say, trying to chuckle but can't manage to.
"You know you're part of the family, right, Phil ?"
"Yeah, well thanks. Thanks a lot."

Penny walks in and sits down. 

"I think she wants to talk to you, Frank", says Penny.
"Alrighty", he says cheerily, slapping my shoulder, playfully.

Christ, that was weird. I tell myself I'm probably just tired. Penny looks kindly at me.

"This must be pretty hard for you, Phil. Dealing with all this for the first time."
"Yeah, it's kinda frightening."
"Yeah", she said, moving closer to me. "You must be so stressed. Never able to let off some steam."

She starts to gently massage my shoulder and I quickly jerk away. She doesn't seem to notice.

"No, well, I'm fine", I say nervously.
"Frank and I never, let off any "steam" anymore. It's frustrating", she whispers, looking into my eyes. Her smile fades. "Would you fuck me ?", she asks.

My eyes widen and I find I'm utterly speechless. What is happening ? Suddenly, she throws her head back and wheezes a good natured laugh. She looks at me.

"I'm kidding, Phil. Jeeze. Calm down. You look like you've seen a ghost", she laughs.

I don't even bother trying to laugh.

"Oh, I'm sorry, Phil, I shouldn't be messing with you like this, considering what's going on. I didn't even think, oh I'm sorry. It's just that Frank and I have been holed up in this big house for a while and we've kind've developed an irreverent sense of humour."
"No, it's fine", I say. "I'm just kinda tired. I think I'm gonna go to bed."
"Okay, but have some dinner first, I've been cooking a stew for a while in the upstairs kitchen. I at least owe that to you."
"Sounds delicious", I smile.

I sit down at the table with Penny and Frank and begin to nibble at my food. Benny is standing in the corner, ferociously eating an apple, the metal bat resting on his shoulder.

I eat my food quickly, knowing that the sooner I eat this, the sooner I can go to sleep and end this fucked up day. I am just finshing up when Benny comes out from his corner. He looks down on me, frowning.

"What did you do ?", he grunts.
"Excuse me ?", I ask politely.

He slams his fist down on the table and I jump.

"I said WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO MY SISTER, YOU ASSHOLE ?", he yells in my face.
"BENNY !", shouts Frank.
"What !", asks Benny.
"Go to your room !"
"Benny", says Penny. She then looks into Benny's eyes and nods to him, as if they both know something that I don't.
"Fine", Benny submits and retreats to his room.
"Gosh, I am so sorry about that, Phil. He's a little highly strung today", says Frank.
"It's no problem", I lie. "But I think I'm gonna go hit the hay, if that's okay."
"Sure, you must be exhausted", sympathises Penny.

I make my way up to my room and fall asleep almost as my head hits the pillow. I wake up at one in the morning. There is a sliver of moonlight shining in the window. I look out into the hall and I think I see the silhouette of Penny sitting outside my room, staring at me. I squint. No, it couldn't be. My suspicions are confirmed however, when the figure stands up and walks away, with bushy hair flowing behind them.

My heart pumps as I get up and go out into the hallway. No one is there. I rub my eyes. Did I dream it ? I decide to go to the kitchen for some water. I root around in the fridge and find a bottle of water.

"Phil."

I jump and spin around, nearly passing out from the fright. It's Frank standing still in the shadows.

"Oh, Frank. You scared the shit outta me", I chuckle.

He slowly and quietly walks up to me.

"DID YOU FUCK MY WIFE ?", he screams in my face.

I fall back clutching the fridge, shaking with fear, before realising what's going on. 

"Was that..... a ...... joke ?", I ask.

He stays silent for a minute, before releasing a wave of laughter. His face is red and he clutches my shoulder.

"I'm sorry, man", he wheezes. "You're just so easy to get."
"Yeah", I laugh, more from relief than anything else. "You got me good. Are you sure that was a good idea, to shout like that in the middle of the night ?"

He continues his fit of giggles.

"We have very thick walls", he says, still laughing.

I walk back to my room and I still can feel his eyes on the back of my head as I go back to my bed.

I wake up and it's morning. Thank fuck. That was one weird day yesterday. I go down stairs and find the place empty. I decide to go check on Belle. I walk into her living room and find the restrainment seat empty. I look around, panicked.

Belle comes at me from behind, knocking me to the ground. She wraps her fingers around my throat and chokes me. I start to lose breath. My eyes are filling with water. I get my feet under her stomach and push with all my might. She falls to the floor as I scramble up. She pulls a letter opener out of the coffee table and I run out the back door into the back garden. I keep running and escape into the shed in the back and I close the door and lock it. It's dark in here.

"Greetings."

My heart stops from fright. I turn and see the gardener standing perfectly still in front of me. Her hands are behind her back. She was smiling a wide, genuine smile, but there were tears streaming down her face.

"Oh, hi", I say, panting.

She starts to sob.

"Are you alright ?", I ask.
"Alright ? No, I am most certainly not. I cannot stay in this house any longer. And I can't escape, either."

She calmly brings her hands from behind her back, revealing a gun. She casually puts it in her mouth and pulls the trigger. A spurt of blood escapes the top of her skull and her body simply collapses onto the ground.

I scream. I hyperventilate. I can't breathe properly and I feel like I'm having a heart attack. It's a panic attack. It burst through the shed door. Belle isn't anywhere to be found. I run back into the house and up to my bedroom. I slam the door, processing what I just saw.

Just then, Benny reveals himself to be behind my door. He pushed my onto the bed and leans over me and puts the metal bat on my throat. He presses down with all his weight. This is the third time I've been choked in two days. And I'm getting real fucking sick of it. I grab the lamp on the nightstand and thump him in the head. He falls sideways and I run downstairs, wheezing and struggling for a breath. I rush into the living room.

Frank is sipping a glass of whiskey and gently playing notes on the grand piano. I don't even realise how strange it is that he's drinking whiskey at ten in the morning. Penny is wrapping herself in her shawl.

"Frank, Penny", I scream. "Belle's escaped. Benny just tried to strangle me."

Benny comes downstairs after me. Penny and Frank simply laugh good heartedly.

"No, seriously, please, help. I'm not joking", I plead.

Belle comes into the living room at this point with a handgun and loads it.

"We're not laughing because we don't believe you, Phil", said Penny. "We're laughing because we know."

At that point Frank, Penny and Benny slowly walk towards me, backing me into the corner of the living room. They're coming at me from all angles. No escape.

I look at their faces to look for any sign of a crack that this might be one of their jokes. But their faces are deadly serious as they advance on me. I laugh through the tears streaming down my face to see if they're messing with me. They remain stone faced as they come at me.

My knees turn to jelly as a crushing reality dawns on me. A realisation that it's not just my wife that's trying to kill me. The realisation that every person in this goddamn house is trying to kill me. </TEXT>

[Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/662fxc/the_changing_part_3/) 


I have always loved my wife. She is the greatest. She is witty, but not overtly boastful of her sense of humour, she's attractive but doesn't acknowledge it, she is nice, loyal and understands me. Having said that, I can't deny what has been happening since yesterday. It started off small, yesterday morning.

I woke up yesterday and came downstairs to the kitchen, to find my wife making breakfast. At first, I didn't notice anything unusual. I walked over to her.

"Hey", I smiled. "What 'ya making ?"

She didn't respond. She just stood there in her pink dressing gown, her head down, looking at the pan that she was cooking on. I walked over to her and looked at her. She was frowning but had a wide grin across her face. She didn't notice me there but just kept looking at whatever she was cooking. I looked down and saw what she was cooking. I stepped back and looked cautiously at her intense, focused grin. She was frying our wedding photos. 

They were just turning black as I put my hand on her shoulder. She jumped back and gasped as if she had just woken up. She looked around the room, dazed. She looked terrified. The pan fell on the floor. I turned the cooker off and cleaned up the ashes of our wedding photos as she sat down silently and sipped a glass of water.

"Belle ?", I asked, concerned. "Are you alright ?"
"I-I don- what happened ?"
"That's what I'm wondering", I said.
"I don't know, I must've been sleep walking or something. What was I cooking ?"

I decided not to tell her considering it was obviously not deliberate.

"Nothing, just paper from the printer."

After that things went back to normal for a while. Until about four in the afternoon yesterday everything was pretty much fine. Then I got home from the grocery store and hear a banging sound coming from the kitchen and I run in to find my wife slowly pounding her fist over and over again on our goldfish, which was now just a stain on the kitchen table. She was giggling happily to herself through that same, almost angry grin. 

"Belle, what the fuck ?", I shouted at her.

She looked at me and stopped laughing. She stood up with a completely vacant look on her face. She was a mess. There was blood all over her hands and she had pissed herself and there was urine soaked into her pants. She just stared at me without any emotion, as if she was just staring at a wall.

Suddenly, the life seeped back into her eyes. She looked around bewildered, just like last time, just like she was waking up. She looked at her hands and her pants and the table. She began to sob. 

"Help me, Phil. Please, I'm scared, what's happening to me ?", she cried at me.

I wrapped my arms around her and told her the biggest lie I've ever told. I told her that everything would be fine. The truth is, I didn't know what was happening to her either. I was just as scared as she was. She was inconsolable for a while.

Later, after she'd calmed down, I told that I'd make an appointment with a doctor. He gave me an appointment for today at two. She was in the living room, still shaking.

"We've got an appointment at two tomorrow", I said.
"Okay", she said distantly.
"Listen, It's going to be alright", I told her. "Maybe it's just some kind of deficiency. Maybe you aren't drinking enough water. I've heard that weird shit happens when you're dehydrated."
"Yeah", she sighed, knowing none of that was true. We both knew.

We went to bed early last night. I brought her upstairs and she fell asleep almost immediately. I fed my hamster and went to sleep as well. I couldn't sleep much, obviously, but I must have drifted off at some point because I woke up at around four in the morning. It was pitch black but I knew Belle wasn't there.

I reached out my hand and felt nothing but air in my bed. I got up and walked groggily downstairs. I didn't even know what was happening until I heard the squeals. Not loud ones. I could just barely hear something squeaking in pain and struggling. I walked into the kitchen and turned on the lights. She was cooking again. My heart started pumping.

The smell was horrible. I looked at her. There was no grin this time. No giggling, no terrifying look in her eyes. Just nothing. Her face was completely blank. No emotion, just like when she was waking up from it earlier. Her eyes were glazed over, as if she wasn't aware of what she was doing. I was afraid to look on the pan. I knew then and there I shouldn't have looked, and God, I wish I hadn't.

I shakily looked down and saw my hamster being fried alive on the pan. It wasn't squealing anymore, it was just lying there, getting cooked. The smell stung my eyes and I stumbled back. I tried to scream but no sound came out. I didn't wake her up that time. I ran back upstairs and waited in bed. About an hour later I heard her scream and heard the pan fall. I waited for her to come back up but she never did. She never did.

It's midday, now. I've been in bed since that happened last night. I don't hear her move at all downstairs. I heard her go outside a couple of times during the night but she always came back in. I'm too afraid to get up. I don't know what's happening but I just have to stick it out until two. Then we can go to the doctors. 

I decide I should check on her. After all, she is my wife. I don't want her to hurt herself. I brace myself and slowly head downstairs. I creep down the stairs and avoid the kitchen at all costs, in case she hasn't cleaned my pet up yet. I look in all the rooms except the kitchen. She isn't anywhere to be found. I grimace and prepare to go into the kitchen when I hear a sound coming from the basement. I travel into the basement and switch on the light. The bulb is tiny, and only covers the center of the basement. The back and four corners are always completely dark.
 
I squint into the blackness at the back of the basement. I see her figure, standing still. She puts a CD in the old radio and turns it on. She slowly comes out of the shadows. I gasp when I see her. She is wearing her wedding dress and there's blood soaked into the whole left side of it. Her eyes are glazed over and vacant like they were last night. She is holding an axe with dried blood on it. She takes a dew steps and stops. She holds out the head of a rabbit. It's eyes are drooping and covered in blood. She drops it and slowly sings along to the song. It's Chapel of Love by The Dixie Cups.

"Going to the chapel", she wails. "Going to get ma-a-arried."

Only her mouth moves. The rest of her face stays stolid, like she's not even there. Like her body left her behind. She steps toward me singing the same line over and over. The axe is in her left hand and she raises it. Suddenly, she screams and runs toward me, wielding the axe.

I run back up the steps and escape into the living room. She chases me. I look at her, in her bloody wedding dress waving the axe at me, and wonder where the woman I love is gone, and who took her, and why she deserves this.

She lashes the axe out and I barely dodge it. She lodges the axe in the wall and struggles to pull it out angrily. The evil grin is back. She slowly turns around and giggles at my petrified expression. I sprint into our bedroom and lock the door.

I wait here for her to come back. I wait here hoping that two o'clock will fucking come already. Most of all, I wait here and wonder what the hell is going on. Whatever it is, something is wrong. Something is very, very wrong. </TEXT>

[Chapter 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/66islm/motel_demille_chapter_3) 


Eve vomited. She had already thrown up three times from the smell. She waded through the thick black sludge from the decomposing bodies. She finally reached the door before puking again. She stumbled back up the stairs, tears streaming down her face. Her face was stolid. She was impossibly pale and there was a layer of tarry, pungeant goo from her waist down. She kept going up the stairs and ran to her room.

She fell in the door and tore off her pants. The concept of what she had just been through sank in and she had to bite a pillow to stop herself from screaming. She looked around. Her mother wasn't there. Eve needed her and she wasn't there. Of course she wasn't.

Linda sipped her martini as Dennis cleaned the countertop. He seemed to be relaxing a little.

"So why did you move here ?", asked Linda.
"Why ?"
"Yes, well you and your son moved here after your sister and niece did."
"Oh, well I divorced my wife and I got custody of Alastair and she got my daughter and I had nowhere else to go."
"Yeah I left my husband not long ago too. It sucks, huh ?"
"Yeah", responded Dennis before a look of realisation came over his face and he remained silent.

After several minutes of silence on Dennis' part, Linda wandered back upstairs to her room. She walked in and saw that Peter was already asleep. She fell on her bed, wondering how her life had gotten so out of control. Linda looked over at her son. What would she do when the summer is over ? She felt awful. She was making her own child stay in this unsettling motel that only the scum of the earth pass through. She began to cry.

Hours later, Peter woke up and quickly scanned the room. He felt as though someone was watching him. He checked his watch, barely able to make out the time in the darkness. Midnight. He looked around the room once more and then at the end of his bed. His felt the blood going from his face to his feet. He saw a child, no older than four or five, standing on the end of his bed. He wasn't smiling or giggling, he was just staring at Peter. He had long, blonde-white hair down to his shoulders and was wearing a tiny, old fashioned suit from the 50's. Peter tried to scream but nothing came out. Upon seeing that Peter was awake, the boy slowly turned around and crept into the darkness. Peter didn't fall back asleep.

The next morning, Eve was still laying on her bed, the pillow saturated with tears. She stared at the ceiling. She didn't know what to do. No one could help her. She didn't even know where she would go if she did call the police. Her mother and uncle would probably get arrested as well, for being an accessory and Eve had nowhere else to go.

Eve looked at her clock. It was nearly twelve. Still hours until her mother would arrive. Eve crept down the stairs and looked into the lobby. No one was there except Constance. Eve walked shakily over to the couches and thought about her options. Just as she sat down, she heard the door open. It was her mother. She was home early for once. Cordelia stumbled over to the stairs, her eyes not even open. Eve decided not to confront her until she got to their room. Eve followed her all the way up to the room. Cordelia didn't notice.

When they both got to the room, Eve began to hyperventilate.

"Mom", she asked timidly. "I know I don't ask you for a lot, but I really need your help right now."

No response.

"Mom, please. Okay, I'm just gonna say it. Elanora's been killing people. I went into the basement and I fell into a heaping pile of old bodies."

Cordelia didn't even react. She stayed quiet as if this wasn't earth shattering news for her.

"Mom, please. We're not safe here. Please, Mom, please, I'm scared. I don't know what to do. ANSWER ME !", screamed Eve, before beginning to sob again out of frustration.

Cordelia sauntered into her bedroom with a bottle of vodka and slammed the door shut as if nothing had happened.

Eve traveled back to the lobby. She sat at the empty bar. The door opened once again and a woman dressed in a white buttoned shirt tucked into a black, plain skirt walked in. She had dyed, wine colour, wavy hair that was tied back, making extreme angles around her face, which was quite pale, except for the bright red lipstick she wore. She took off her black, 1960's sunglasses and peered around the place. She walked up to Constance.

"I'd like three days please, darling", she said in a ridiculously posh voice.
"Reservation ?", grumbled Constance.
"As a matter of fact, I do."
"You do ?"
"I do, sweetie."
"Name ?"
"Wilkinson. Grace Wilkinson."
"I don't have any-"

Elanora burst in before Constance could finish her mumble.

"Grace !", she exclaimed.
"Elanora, honey. You look even more vibrant than I'd pictured you."
"It's alright Ms.Utile, Grace called me last week", Elanora said to Constance.

Eve ducked into the dining room before Elanora saw her. Constance gave Grace her key as her and Elanora exchanged a few more pleasantries. When they were both gone, Eve went to her spot on the couches and picked the pack of cigarettes that she hid between the cushions and went outside.

Eve went outside and once again sat on the porch. She lit up a cigarette and slowly inhaled the smoke, held it and then released it. She looked off into the distance. She didn't know what was happening. She didn't know why this was happening to her. She knew she didn't deserve this. 

Suddenly, Peter appeared on the porch behind her. 

"Can I sit ? My mom's gone off to get some clothes down town", he asked.
"Yeah, fine."

She continued to puff on the cigarette as he sat down next to her.

"So, you said you had a cousin, right ?"
"Yeah, Damien ?"
"I thought his name was Alastair ?"
"It is but you can call him Damien."
"Like.... from.."
"The Omen. You know, the little creepy shit who was possessed ?"
"Yeah I love that movie. So you think he's possessed, huh ?"
"Probably, knowing that weirdo."
"Has he ever done anything "Omenish" to you ?"
"Why, has he to you ?"
"Well, last night I woke up in the middle of the night and I thought I felt someone staring at me and, when I woke up, there he was. Standing on the end of my bed, staring at me."
"Holy shit, are you sure ?"
"Does he have long, white hair and wear a weird suit ?"
"Yeah."
"Then yes, I am."
"Yet another fucked up thing in the Motel DeMille."
"Why, what else happened ?"
"Oh, nothing, it's just that Damien has done shit like that before."
"To you ?"
"Well, when he and Dennis first moved here, I went to my room and he.....", Eve trailed off.
"You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to."
"No it's fine, it's just..... he "found" a dead fox out on the highway and..... he..... brought it to my room and...", Eve's eyes began to well up. "He got some pictures of my dad and smeared the blood all over them and left them on my bed. We couldn't get the smell out for weeks and I had to throw out the pictures."
"Holy fuck. I guess I got off light then."
"No, even what he did to you shouldn't happen to people. I'm gonna go talk to Dennis about that little fucker."
"No ! No, please don't", asked Peter. "I don't want any trouble. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't getting haunted."

Eve sat back down. She took out another cigarette and lit up.

"You know what I was thinking ?", she said.
"What ?"
"I've probably met my father's killer."
"What ?", said Peter, alarmed.
"Before I was born, before he was with my mom, my dad was engaged to this chick called Kate McClure. They were set to get married when she went nuts. She started abusing my father and hitting him and shit. So he left, obviously and met my mom. Years later she comes back and murders my dad for leaving her. None of us ever knew what she looked like and it turned out the name she'd been using all those years was fake. So they never caught her. She probably came through here. I've probably met my father's killer."
"No, she wouldn't be stupid enough to go to a Motel called DeMille, surely."
"She'd definitely be crazy enough."
"And your aunt would recognise her and do something."
"None of us knew what she looked like, she was here, I'm telling you. And if I ever see her again, I'll kill her." 
"Come, on. Don't talk like that", said Peter worryingly.

Eve went for her third cigarette and continued to stare at the empty highway.

"I'm gonna go get some breakfast", said Peter. "You want some ?"
"No, I'm gonna stay here."

After a while, when Peter was finished, he made his way back up to his room. He went up the floors. He couldn't remember which room was his. He'd only been in there once and he'd forgotten the number. Linda had the key but she'd left the room open. Was it 17 ? No, 19. No, 29. Which one wasn't he supposed to go in ? He decided on the third floor. He went along the empty corridor and stood in front of room 29. He twisted the knob. It was open. He walked inside and looked around. It wasn't his. It was bigger and had a large fireplace in the middle. 

He turned on the lights and his knees turned to jelly. The were two large tables in the room. Laying on one was Elanora's dead body. It had a tube going into her left, pale arm. On the other table was another dead body of someone whom he didn't recognise. It was impossibly thin and wrinkly and was already turning black. The blood from his body was being fed into her dead body.

"Well, hello, Peter."

Peter jumped and turned around. It was Elanora. A different Elanora. An alive Elanora.

"Wha- ? No, I di- ", Peter hyperventilated.
"You must be very confused, Peter. Allow me to explain. Five years ago, just before Cordelia and Eve moved here, I died. I was killed by a guest. Luckily for me, however, I had a witch curse me fifteen years ago. You know Constance, I trust ?  Well, I had her curse me. So, as long as I feed my dead body a full person worth of blood once a week, I can stay here, as a ghost and avoid divine judgement. And where better to get a dead body every week than a hotel full of criminals that no one will miss. How do you think that I uphold such a good record of harbouring criminals ? Easy. They never leave. Not one criminal has ever left this Motel. Pretty impressive, no ? You look terribly confused. Let me summarise. I have murdered every criminal that has stayed here so I can live forever. And not as a walk through walls, floating ghost. I can still eat, sleep, feel and be hurt. I just can't die. Unless someone finds my real body, of course."

Peter was still trying to process this bombshell and stay alive simultaniously. He stepped back and felt around for the lamp on one of the nightstands.

"Bu- but what about all the criminals before five years ago ? Why did you kill them ?", said Peter, trying not to cry.
"Oh, that was just for fun. And so they wouldn't leave and tell the authorities about this place. We can't have that, Peter, now can we ?"

Peter ripped the lamp out of it's socket but Elanora lunged for the poker in the fire and plunged it through Peter's chest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Chapter 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64y3i8/motel_demille_chapter_2/) 

[Chapter 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/66islm/motel_demille_chapter_3) 


Motel DeMille. 1983. Sedona, Arizona. A red '79 Beatle pulled into the near vacant lot in front of the minuscule motel that sat, still and quiet on the side of the otherwise lonely highway. A woman, clad in a red, cashmere blazer with bright red, silk bell bottoms to match, climbed out of the car with her son by her side. She strode coolly towards the glass paned door, her thick, black, curly hair waving behind her. Even as she strolled into such a modest business, she exuded confidence, head up, sunglasses perched firmly in her voluminous frizzy hair. 


The same could not be said for her son however, he limped in the direction of the entrance, weighed down by his mother's luggage. He wore a loose, long t-shirt with baggy, worn shorts and a tight cap over his short, fuzzy hair. He had a slight hunch and a worryingly skinny physique and was several strides behind his mother the whole way across the car park.


They both arrived in the cosy motel and walked up to the front desk. The receptionist was a large woman, with round jam jar glasses and was dressed in several layers of cardigans. She had grey, curly hair and looked to be in her sixties.


"I'd like a two bed room for the week, please and thanks, sweetie", said the woman, smiling.

"Reservation ?", asked the receptionist.

"Uh no, I was kinda counting on you having a vacancy."

"Names ?"

"Linda...... Rhodes", she said, deciding not to give her real name.

"And the boy ?"

"Peter. Peter Rhodes", said Linda.

"Okay. Fine. Room 17. Here's the key."


The white door to the stairs opened as the receptionist hands over the key and the most beautiful woman Linda had ever seen stridesld out and across the lobby. She has had flowing white hair and snow white skin and small, fragile, dainty features. She sauntered over to Linda. The contrasts were striking. Linda was wearing stylish, expensive flashy attire, whereas the woman wore only a toga type shawl. Linda's dark skin was noticeable against the woman's almost spooky paleness. The woman had long, white hair, and Linda had a dark afro. The woman held out her arms and smiled.


"Welcome to Motel DeMille. I'm the owner. My name is Elanora DeMille", she held out her hand.



Linda took it.



"Linda Rhodes."

"An absolute pleasure", beamed Elanora. "This is Constance Utile. She is the receptionist and she likes to be referred to as Ms. Utile." 

Next she gestured toward the young woman sweeping in the back of the lobby. "That is Kitty, the maid. She will be cleaning your room between the hours of twelve and one each day and you are expected to vacate the room during this time. Over there, at the bar by the entrance to the dining area, is my brother, Dennis DeMille. He is the barman. His infant son is also staying with us. Breakfast will be served between nine and eleven. Lunch from two to three, and dinner from six to eight."


"Wow", said Linda. "Well that certainly was a warm welcome."


A particularly sullen looking teenage girl strutted into the lobby from the stairs. She was wearing a walkman and didn't seem to notice Elanora or the new guests.


"Eve !", exclaimed Elanora. "Come greet the new guests. This is my niece, Eve. She's the only daughter of my sister, Cordelia."


Elanora's smile faded slightly when she uttered her sister's name.


"They both live here also", continued Elanora. "All the DeMilles under one roof."


Eve wandered over to the Rhodes, her chestnut hair flowing behind her.


"Welcome to Bates Motel", she said before turning around and laying down on the couches in the lobby.


"Ah, she has an...... alternative sense of humour", chuckled Elanora. "Would you care to have a drink with me in the dining area, alone, just for a few minutes, Ms. Rhodes ? I have some..... rules to discuss with you before you get comfortable."


"Sure thing", said Linda. "Peter, why don't you go sit in lobby while you wait."


The pair of women started toward the dining room, while Peter decided whether or not to sit down next to an attractive, albeit grumpy girl his age. He tentatively sat down opposite her in an armchair.


The two women sat down at a table in the empty dining room and Dennis served them two glasses of whiskey. Linda was slightly unnerved by Dennis. He was in his fifties, yet still had a pointed strand of hair dyed bright red on his forehead. He looked as though he couldn't speak, as if he'd been sworn to secrecy and didn't trust himself to even produce a syllable.


"So", began Elanora. "I trust you know the nature of this motel, considering you actually found us."

"I know what I heard", said Linda.

"And what might that be ?"

"That this is a motel that accepts...... violaters of the law, and allows them to lay low until the suspicion of law enforcement wears off."

"Exactly. We allow criminals to stay here exclusively, in exchange for a handsome fee."

"Which I have paid in full."

"Yes, you have. But, due to the nature of this place, we sometimes get into some trouble regarding the guests, which is why I don't think this is any place for a child."

"But, you're niece and infant nephew live here."

"Yes and we don't allow them to interact with guests that have a certain...... unsavoury aura about them. I just wouldn't want anything to happen to your son."

"Peter can handle himself just fine."

"You're sure ? I must stress that we will not accept any responsibility for the fate of you or your son whilst you are staying here."

"I understand."

"Now, to business. There a very few, but very extremely strict rules that guests must abide by whilst here at the Motel DeMille."

"Okay, go on."

"Rule number one : never, ever, under any circumstances go into the basement. If you or your son does, you will be punished severley. Rule number two : Do not under any circumstances go into room 29. Punishment will be equally severe for this violation. Rule number three : Do not go into rooms 4, 9, 13, 19, or 21. These are the rooms that Eve, Cordelia, Dennis, his son Alastair, Kitty, Constance and myself live in. There isn't any punishment for this rule, but I won't be liable for anything we do if you do in fact trespass on us. And that's it. Those are the three rules. Follow those and we should get along just fine."

"Great, we can do that."

"Oh, and also don't try to use the elevator, it's broken."

"Sure thing. Um...... Given the purpose of this place, I don't have to tell you the reason why I am here, do I ?"

"Oh goodness no", chirped Elanora. "We have a strict 'don't ask don't tell' policy around here."


Peter sat down opposite Eve awkwardly, nervously looking around the lobby. Eve sat up and looked at him.


"So what're you here for ?", she asked him.

"Who, me ?", he said, immediately regretting he'd opened his mouth.

"Well, there isn't anybody else here, is there ?"

"My mother says I'm not allowed to talk about it."

"You don't know, do you ?"

"No", he relented.

"Hmmm. We don't usually get kids around here."


Eve got up and took off her headphones.


"You coming out for a smoke ?", she asked nonchalantly.

"Oh, yeah, sure. Of course", he blurted.


The two of them walked out and sat on the porch. She took out a packet of cigarettes and placed one between her lips. She took out a matchbox, struck a match and tenderly lit the end of the cigarette. She inhaled and slowly released a cloud of smoke, watching it dissipate into the air.


"So where's your dad ?", asked Eve.

"He left my mom and I. Only last week, actually."

"Jesus. I'm sorry."

"No, it's fine. He was kind of an asshole. He was completely an asshole, actually."

"Huh. Well at least he's still around."

"Yours isn't ?"

"Nope. He was murdered five years ago."

"Fuck. I'm sorry."

"Yeah, he was pretty great. They never caught the killer. After he died, my mom and I moved here, with the rest of our fucked up family."

"You don't like it here ?"

"Course not. It's in the middle of nowhere, there's never anything to do, the only people I ever see are my creepy relatives and the criminals that pass through here. It gets lonely."

"What about your mom ? She doesn't take you out to places ?"

"My mother ? Are you kidding ? I can't even remember the last time my mom even spoke to me ?"

"You guys don't speak ? I thought you lived in the same room ?"

"We do. But that doesn't stop her. Every day since we moved here she goes out in a taxi at about eight every night and doesn't come back until two the next day, smelling of booze, with her underwear in her pockets. Then she eats something, sleeps until eight and does it all over again. Every single day since dad died. She doesn't work, or drive either. She hasn't been sober in five years."

"Five years, huh ?", said Peter. "That's rough."

"I wouldn't even be in school if it wasn't for Elanora. And now it's the summer and I have to just wander around all day, every day. Sorry about all this, you must think I'm some kind of weirdo, spilling my guts to you like this, but, no ever talks to me around here. I can't tell anybody how frustrating it is."

"No, it's fine. I haven't really spoken to anyone in a real long time, either. Whatever my mom did, it must've been bad. We had to go from hotel to hotel for ages before we heard about this place."

"Well, it whatever it was, she's not nearly as bad as my mother."


Eve put out her cigarette and walked back inside just as a taxi pulled into the parking lot. A dishevelled looking woman stumbled out of the car. She threw a few dollar bills in the window of the cab. She had wild, frizzy, dyed blonde hair with noticeable dark roots. 

She had heavy mascara around her eyes and black mascara stains streaming down her cheeks. She had bright red lipstick smeared all over her lips and chin. She was wearing a tight, blue mini-dress that left far too little up to the imagination and heels so large Peter wondered how she stayed upright. She stumbled along the pathway up to the porch with a bottle of whiskey in one hand, the other shielding the sun from her eyes. She didn't even notice Peter sitting there as she stumbled through the door. A smell of alcohol and sweat wafted onto Peter as she went by him.


Peter walked back inside just in time to see his mother come out of the dining area holding her drink. She came over to him and ushered him along towards the stairs.


"Come on", she said, hurrying him along.

"What ?", he asked. "What's wrong ?"

"I don't know but we're getting out of here just about as soon as we possibly can."


The mother and son reached their room and scurried inside. They laid their luggage down on one of the beds. 


"What did she say ?", asked Peter.

"She said that we're not allowed to go into the basement or room 29 under any circumstances. She said we'd be punished or something."

"Punished ?", chuckled Peter.

"Yes, I have a bad feeling about this place. That woman is hiding something, and I don't intend on sticking around to find out what that is."


Evening came and Eve was still as frustratingly bored as she was all day. Her mother was gone again. She found herself back in the lobby. Elanora glided in, graceful as ever. 


"Why Eve, why don't you go set the tables for dinner ?", she asked.


Eve would be grateful for the distraction, if it wasn't doing menial tasks for no pay, only for no one to even show up to dinner. She rolled her eyes and trudged into the dining room.


Linda came into the lobby and sat down at the bar as Elanora sauntered back into one of the hallways. She sat down at the bar and looked at Dennis. He avoided catching her eye and continued to clean glasses.


"I'll take a martini please, barman", she said.

"Coming up", muttered Dennis.

"So", said Linda after he served her the drink. "How long have you been here ?"

"Two years", he mumbled, still not looking at her.

"So you've been living here with your son, huh ?"

"Yes", he said.

"What age ?"

"Five."

"So this is all the DeMilles then ? Under one roof ?"

"Yep."

"What's it like working for your sister ? She can be pretty intense, huh ?"

"You're telling me", he said dryly.

"She always like that ?"

"For as long as I can remember, at least. No wonder I chose to work at a bar", he said quietly.


Linda laughed and Dennis smiled. It wasn't often he got to chat  to the guests.


Eve was reluctantly setting the twenty or so tables in the dining room for what felt like hours. She didn't see why she even needed to do this, they only actually had one guest staying with them. She stopped. She decided she was fed up doing this. She decided she was fed up living in one room in the middle of the desert with a bunch of weirdos. She decided to go to the basement. For the five years she'd been there, Elanora had told her the same thing every single day : don't go into the basement. Eve had never once dared to go there. What could she be hiding that was so bad, anyway ?


Eve grabbed the torch from the front desk and quickly went down the stairs in the lobby. She slowed down as she neared the door. Something about it made her feel uneasy. It would probably be locked anyway, right ? No, she wouldn't lose her nerve now. She touched the white door. She jumped as she heard a click. She pushed open the door and stepped inside.


It was pitch dark and the door closed behind her. She tripped and fell knee deep into something thick and sludgy. It smelled rancid. She turned on her flashlight. It was dead bodies. She was laying in a sea of dead bodies. Eve screamed.

The next week, Tony woke up in his new apartment and had breakfast with his new friend. So there they were, just a couple of attractive, platonic friends living in a stylish yet impossibly cheap apartment in New York.

"Howdy Tony !" smiled Lizzie.

"Hey, guess what ?", said Tony.

"What ?"

"I got two of the resident artists from that posh gallery down at NYU to come look at one of my pieces."

"Oh my god, that's great, Tony. Wait, they're coming here ?"

"Yep. 12 o'clock sharp tomorrow. And they're real serious, sophisticated types so make sure to wear something nice."

"Wear something nice ?", she said, offended.

"Well you know, just not in pyjamas."

"And what makes you think I'll be in my pyjamas at 12 o'clock ?"

"I... I don't. Just in case."

"Hmm. Anyway did I tell you I met someone ?"

"You did ? That's great !"

"Yep. His name's Chip and he owns a bar downtown."

"Wow, that's great."

"Well look at us", said Lizzie. "Just two friends having a grand old time in New York."

"Anyways I gotta go out, I've got to go buy a suit for tomorrow."

"Okay", she chirped.

Tony sauntered out into the hallway, finally feeling something positive again since Lily died. The door opposite their apartment opened and an ld woman in a red, flowery night dress and curlers in her hair peered out. She didn't look happy. She had one of those faces that always looked angry.

"Good morning", greeted Tony as he shut the door behind him.

"What are you so grinning about ?", she inquired with a deep, raspy voice.

This struck Tony as an odd way to introduce ones self to a perfect stranger.

"Actually, things are finally going my way, miss."

The old woman rolled her eyes and lit up a cigarette.

"Uh, I don't think you're allowed to do that inside anymore", said Tony politely.

"You know what's wrong with kids like you nowadays ?", she continued. "You all think your entitled to a rich and stress free life like those idiots on tv, and you think your working but you don't know what real work is like. Like that poor Lizzie you moved in with. She thinks she was come here and everything was gonna turn up rosy, but that was never gonna happen. And look at her now. Throwing raves and getting drunk with you and disturbing my sleep while your at it."

"We've literally never done that."

"You do it alright, you goddamn kids, always intruding on an old lady like that, you oughtta be ashamed...."

With that, she closed the door in his face. Tony went back inside to Lizzie.
"Um.... why did an old lady just criticize my whole generation before she even said hello to me ?"

"Oh, that's just Mrs. Crooks. She just like to complain, she doesn't mean half the things she says", she assured him.

"Okaaay. Still in the pjs, huh ?", he said and left, leaving Lizzie on her own in the apartment. Lizzie decided to invite her gentleman caller over. After a while he showed up and subsequently broke her heart by telling her that she shouldn't have quit her job to become a writer and that her couldn't be in a relationship with someone who wore pyjamas until 1 o'clock. Lizzie wandered out, crying into the hall after he left. Mrs.Crooks came out.

"Why so blue, sweetie ?", she asked, puffing another cigarette.

"My guy just broke it off with me because he thinks I should've kept working for a pig."

"Sounds like a real asshole."

"No, maybe he's right. Even Tony told me I shouldn't wear pyjamas at 1 in the day."

"You're new roommate ?"

"Yeah, he said it wasn't sophisticated. Just because he got a fancy art job now he looks down on me. It's not like I'm not working I've been writing all day every day."

"Sophisticated ? Fuck sophisticated, honey. Your doing what you love, and there ain't nobody can shit on that, not your asshole boyfriend or some art stiff."

"Thanks, Mrs.Crooks. But, could you do me a favour ?"

"Sure."

"Just don't tell Tony that I broke up with Chip. Just tell him that we, you know...."

"Fucked ?"

"Well, yeah, if you wouldn't mind. I just don't want him to think I'm a complete fuck up."

"Sure thing, sweetie."

Lizzie went back, angry that all the men in her life think she's lazy. Tony came home just as she was about to change. He was carrying bags. She couldn't even remember what he bought, as she was still angry about earlier.

"How was your day ?", he asked happily.

"Fantastic. Chip came over."

"So it's still going strong huh ? Looks like it's cause for a celebration. How about some of Poland's finest tonic ?"

Lizzie could've sworn she heard a laugh track.

"What ?"

"Well I couldn't afford Champagne, so I went to the Polish shop and this was in the 10 cent bin, so there you go."

"Yummy."

Morning came and Lizzie got up feeling even worse after that Polish tonic shit. She rose up and didn't even bother putting on real clothes, as she was still angry about the day before. She sauntered into the kitchen, grabbing the tonic on her way. She took a swig and burped loudly on the way into the kitchen. She turned and saw the two artists and Tony in a suit. The artists. Holy shit, she forgot about the artists. Suddenly, Mrs.Crooks burst in.

"Hey, sweetie, I heard you banged your man real good last night, huh ?", she recited before leaving.

The artist, seemingly horrified scurried out, leaving an apologetic Lizzie in front of Tony, who was in disbelief. 

"Oh my God. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so, so, so sorry", pleaded Lizzie. "I completely forgot."

Tony sighed.

"It's fine, Lizzie."

"No, it's not I-"

"No really, I've been a dick to you all week and I'm sorry I deserved it. I was nervous about getting accepted into that pretentious place anyway."

"Well, since we're being honest, Chip dumped me."

"I'm sorry, Liz."

The pair sat down on the floor, after learning a painfully obvious, yet nevertheless important life lesson; friendship is more important in life than material goods. They poured some Polish tonic and clinked their glasses together, glad that they'd found each other. </TEXT>

Tony walked along the streets of New York with his head down, still in despair about Lily. As he trudged ahead he crashed into someone and the world was temporarily turned upside down. He scrambled back up, regaining his composure and noticing the woman he had crashed into had dropped her bags, spilling papers and personal effects all over the street.

"Oh god, I'm sorry. I wasn't looking where I was going. Oh, jeese. I'm sorry", sighed Tony as he rushed to help her pick her things back up.

Tony and the woman locked eyes and he felt something he hadn't felt since Lily died. Hope. She had icy blue eyes and flowing chestnut hair. She looked into his eyes, smiling kindly.

"Don't worry about it. I was rushing too much as usual anyways", she laughed.
 
Tony helped her pick up her things and stood up.

"Well thanks a bunch for that. Not everyone in this city would be so nice", said the woman.

 Tony looked at her. She had piles of folders in her arms and there were several bags hanging out of each arm. She was being weighed down with each stumble.

"You want me to carry some of those for you ?", asked Tony.

"Oh no, that's okay. It's giving me a great workout", she said her voice strained from the pressure.

"You sure ?"

"Well, if you really want to....", she said as the folders began to topple again. Tony thrust out his arms and caught them.

"Whew ! Thanks, pal", she beamed.

The pair walked down the street.

"So what's your name ?", she asked him.

"Tony", he responded.

"Well, Tony, you might just be the last gentleman left in New York."

"What about you ?"

"Am I a gentleman ?"

"No", chuckled Tony. "What's your name ?"

"Oh, it's Lizzie. Ah.... are you alright ?"

"Me ? Yeah I'm fine, why ?"

"It's just that you look significantly more gloomy than everyone else in this city, which is pretty difficult."

"Oh it's a long story."

"We've got time, the parking lot is another few blocks away."

"No.....I'd rather not talk about it."

"Okey dokey. How about I bore you with the details of my awful day then ?"

"Great", he smiled.

"Well first off I wake up and the first thing my roommate tells me is that she's moving out because she can't stand the sight of my fingernails."

"Fingernails ?"

"Yeah, she works for some fancy ass fashion company and believes everyone should have "poppin'" nails. Then I go out to my shitty car and realise a squirrel just died on the bonnet and had to whack it off with a crow bar I found on my balcony a few weeks ago. Next I arrive at my dead end receptionist job and my pig boss asks me to bring these big ass folders full porno magazines to the dump before his wife catches him and then makes me do his grocery shopping."

"Sounds pretty awful."

"Yep. It was. Was your day as bad as that ?"

"Somewhere around that level, yeah."

"Well here we are."

They arrived at the old, rusted car and Lizzie popped open the trunk and heaved all the porn folders into the car.

"Well, I thank for your service, good sir", she said.

"Anytime", smiled Tony.

"Hey" called Lizzie as he walked away."Do you.... wanna get some ice cream by any chance ?"

"Ice cream ?"

"Yeah, I really don't wanna go back to work and it's a nice day and...... you know what, never mind, it was stupid."

"No, no. I'd love some ice cream."

The two friends hopped in the decomposing car and arrived at the ice cream shop in minutes. They sat on the bonnet of the car eating ice cream.

"So what do you do for a living ?", asked Lizzie.

"Well I was trying to get my art business off the ground in Paris but- things got in the way and....... here I am."

"Huh. Well you can always try and start it up here. It is the concrete jungle where dreams are made of, you know. There's nothing you can't do."

"Yeah, I guess. So what about you ? How did you end up disposing of porn folders ?"

"Well I moved to New York to start a new Sex and the City super cool lifestyle where my biggest problems would be picking the right pair of super sexy shoes to go to some super sexy party with my super sexy friends, but that obviously didn't happen and five years later, here I am. Sitting on a car full of my boss's porn eating ice cream with a stranger."

"And what would you like to do ?"

"I mean..... I guess I want to be a writer. Well, I know I want to be a writer, but I guess I wanna pursue it."

"I think you should."

"You do ?", she looked at him hopefully.

"Of course. Life is relatively short. There's literally no point in ending up doing something you don't like doing for the majority of it."

"You know what ?", she smiled. "That's exactly what I'm gonna do. You're a real wise man, you know that Tony ?"

"Well, I try. Have you written anything yet ?"

"I tried to write a random opening paragraph and let things kind've flow from there, but I haven't having a whole lot of flow recently."

"Well go on. Let's hear it."

"Well it's about this dude and he wakes up and his wife is laying next to him and there's a half a pack of playing cards, a coffee jar filled with blood, the drivers seat of their car and their neighbours toupee spread out in front of her and she says there is a reasonable explanation for all of it."

"Sounds........ great."

"It's stupid I know."

"No, no, really. You should do it."

She smiled and looked at her watch.

"Oh, nuts. It's nearly five. I gotta get back to work."

"Oh shit", exclaimed Tony. "I don't have anywhere to stay."

"Hey ! Why don't you stay with me ?", she said enthusaistically. "My roomate just left and I won't be able to pay the rent. It's perfect."

"Really ? You'd be okay with that ? I mean..... I'm a complete stranger. I could be a killer."

"Are you ?"

"No."

"Well then ! I know it's sudden. I didn't mean to sound too eager, but it's  perfect. I need a roommate and you need somewhere to sleep ! How about it ?"

"Why not."

<TEXT>                                                 Shift Part 1
Tony strolled down the Pont des Arts with his girlfriend, Lily. In Tony's eyes, Lily was the most perfect human being in existence. He was in complete, unbridled ecstasy whenever he so much as saw Lily. She was intelligent, but not so intelligent that it became unmanageable. She was witty, but didn't boast her sense of humour. She was calm, collected, kind-hearted and friendly. And she was the most beautiful woman Tony had ever come across. The two strolled merrily down the bridge and Tony stopped. He knelt down on one knee and produced a shiny ring in a red velvet box. Her brown eyes twinkled with joy. She stood there speechless, her mouth agape.


                                                               -------------------------  


Things took a turn for the grim, however when an erratic, out of control French cyclist veered off course and crashed into Tony, causing him to lunge forward, the ring soaring from his grip. The ring took flight and shot straight into Lily's gaping mouth. The ring became lodged in her throat and she lost the ability to breath. Before Tony could gather himself and perform the Heimlich, Lily fell back from the shock and toppled over the bridge. The particularly vicious Seine swallowed her up. The cyclist remounted his bicycle and sped off into the distance. Tony stood there, in utter disbelief of the tragedy that had befallen him.


                                                              ----------------------------



Tony had wandered home, filled with fury. He had just been on top of the world and suddenly, because of one uneasy cyclist, had that all taken from him in mere seconds. Tony had gone to the police station and provided a detailed description of the perpetrator of this heinous act. It turns out, this particular bike enthusiast had a history of hit and run incidents. His name was Pierre Velo. Tony had also paid a visit to the local firearms shop and bought himself some weapons. Tony had one thing to do and that was to avenge the death of his wife to be no matter what. He would take down Pierre the Sadistic Cyclist if it killed him. Tony meaningfully threw a knife at a hand drawn picture of Pierre's likeness that Tony had sketched himself.


                                                                 -------------------------

 

Tony's mission for vengeance took him to New York where he was currently tailing Pierre through a dark alleyway. Tony followed him at a safe distance. Pierre ducked into the side door of a large, plain warehouse. Tony ran up to the small, metal door. He braced himself. Whatever secrets Pierre the Sadistic Cyclist had, whatever had driven him to committing all those hit and runs was behind this door. Tony pushed open the door and stepped inside. His knees turned to jelly at the sight of what was inside the warehouse. Pierre cycled across the warehouse and joined a group of identical Pierres cycling in perfect formation across the empty warehouse. Standing on a stage above the hundreds of Sadistic Cyclist Clones was another identical Pierre, except he was taller and broader and was straddling a larger bicycle. Tony sneaked up to the stage and confronted the seven foot cyclist.

"Who are you, human ?", boomed the biker.

"What is all this ? Who are you ?", gasped Tony.

"I am Pierre, King of the Sadistic Cyclists", proclaimed Pierre.

"You. You killed my fiancee."

"Actually Pierre number 217 did, but that's the general idea, yes. Pierre is one, Pierre is all."

"What are you doing ? How is this possible ? Why did you kill Lily ?"

"We are cleansing the earth. Removing the disease that is man, and replacing them with a flawless species: Pierres. One hit and run at a time."

Before Tony could respond, the ground beneath his feet opened into a dark, metal chasm. Tony fell down the metal pipe until he landed in a dusty old chamber filled with rusty old road signs and several, thin, sickly looking people in shackles. They didn't seem to notice Tony until he spoke.

"Hey !", whispered Tony.

They all looked at him blankly.

"How is all this even possible ? Why are you down here ?"

"We're like you", said one of them in a raspy voice.

"Like me ?"

"We've all lost loved ones to a Pierre, followed them here and gotten imprisoned here forever."

"Why didn't they just kill us like they did with my fiancee ?"

"Apparently we have to be killed in a hit and run incident or not at all."

A Pierre came down the steps into the chamber carrying shackles for Tony. As the Pierre cycled toward him, Tony picked up a twisted, old stop sign and and held it out in front of him. The Sadistic Cyclist stopped dead in it's tracks. It looked as though it were trying to move, but couldn't. The prisoners gasped, wide eyed, at Tony.

"What ?", asked Tony.

"It's the chosen one", whispered one of the prisoners.

"The chosen one ?", chortled Tony.

"It was fabled that a prophet would come in the form of a prisoner and rid the world of the Pierres and free the prisoners. I never believed it would actually happen."

"And how exactly would the chosen go about doing this ?"

"It was rumoured that they would would have the power to take advantage of their biggest weakness. Road signs."

Tony planted the stop sign in the ground and the Pierre stayed put, vibrating from constraint. Tony found a burnt out motorbike have covered in dirt. Tony touched the handlebars and it roared to life. He straddled the motorbike and picked up the stop sign and swung it at the Pierre. It's head rolled onto the ground and the body exploded and sparks and smoke plumed from the charred robotic body. Tony then slashed the prisoners chains open, setting them free. Tony rode up the stairs to the rest of the Pierres. The prisoners escaped out the metal door. All the Pierres immediately started towards him. He planted the stop sign and they all ceased. Another group of them crept up behind him and Tony waved a red traffic light at them. A third group came at him and Tony picked up the stop sign and traffic lights so the whole legion of Pierres were chasing him. He put a 'cycle track this way' sign beside the pit he had fell through on the stage and continued back down. All the Pierres toppled into the pit, one by one, causing a cacophony of electrical explosions emanating from the hole.

"NO. It can't be !", exclaimed Pierre, King of the Sadistic Cyclists.
Tony threw the stop sign at the King. It pierced his chest, causing him to malfunction and spark. Tony then produced his rifle and shot several rounds into the King. He too toppled into the pit. Tony turned, relieved it was over and walked out of the warehouse.

<TITLE> For the Love of Tractors </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-06 18:59:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So there's this guy who reaaaally loves tractors. He had tractor toys, he read tractor weekly, he has tractor posters on his wall.... the works. He spent all his time consumed with tractors. So naturally, his mother got worried. She convinced him to go to the local bar to try and meet someone. 

So he reluctantly goes to the bar and, miraculously, he finds a woman who loves tractors too. (Not as much as him, though because NO-ONE loves tractors as much as this guy). But he meets this girl who loves tractors enough to stimulate him, intellectually. 

So fast forward a couple of months and this guy brings his girlfriend to the local field to watch the tractors go by during the sunset. He proposes to her and she says yes. Then they both fall asleep in the field and he has a dream that a tractor was coming to run over him. He wakes and there is a tractor coming towards him! He quickly rolls away but his fiance gets run over and killed.

He is obviously devastated and swears never to even look at a tractor ever again. So he tears down all his posters and spends all his time in his room, alone and depressed for a few weeks until his mother, again intervenes and gets him to go to the local pub again.

When he arrives, the pub is on fire! He rushes in and takes a deep breath, sucking in all the fire and smoke.

The firemen immediately ask him how he did it.

<TEXT> I drove along the dark desert highway, the cool wind rustling my hair. My coffee was gone and the caffeine boost was wearing off. My eyelids grew heavy and my head lulled back. I jerked back up. I concentrated on the road until a shimmering, hazy light came into view. It was the neon lights of a hotel sign. Thank God, just what I needed

There she stood in the doorway, the pretty but stern looking receptionist. The interior was old fashioned and eerie. It made me uneasy, but I couldn't help admire the photogenic craftsmanship. Such meticulous detail, such obsessive perfection. I thought to myself, "This could be heaven or this could be hell".

As I grew drowsier, I decided I needed a room. We made the transaction and she took out a box of matches and a half melted candle. She struck the match and lit up the drooping candle. She led me down the quiet hallway, the candle illuminating the dimly lit corridor. As I was lead to my room in my sleepy state, I could've sworn I heard voices. They were whispering "Welcome to the Hotel California, such a lovely place. Such a lovely place."

As soon as I entered my room, I flopped onto my bed, limp with exhaustion. My head sank into my pillow and I drifted off into a deep, deep sleep. There was no dreaming that night, just dark, black unconsciousness.

I awoke hours later, covers strewn about. There was a head shaped circle of sweat on my soft, plump pillow. It was still dark. I strolled about the room, looking for my shoes. I didn't remember taking them off. I searched under the covers, only to find them tucked neatly under the dresser beside the bed.

I traveled out of the room and sauntered down the dimly lit corridor. I heard those voices again. Now that I was more alert, I could hear them more clearly. They were coming out of the other rooms, the sounded creepy. Not malevolent exactly, but more melancholy. "Plenty of room at the Hotel California. Anytime of year, you can find it here."

I got to the end of the hallway and noticed the large window overlooking a courtyard across the lobby. I looked through it and saw her, in her Mercedes Benz. She pulled into the courtyard full of her pretty, pretty 'friends'. They all started to dance. They danced through the wee hours of the morning. Some looked as though they wanted to remember, others to forget.

I went to the bar next, asked for some wine. He told me that spirit wasn't sold there since 1969. I walked again past the hallway, again hearing them whisper. "Such a lovely place. Such a lovely face".

I looked around. Neither the barman nor anyone outside seems to notice or care about the voices. I tiptoed carefully past all the rooms to see if I could hear them clearer. "They livin' it up at the Hotel California. What a nice surprise. Bring your alibis."

Thoroughly freaked out, I left the corridor filled with such haunting voices, and jogged over to a set of double white doors on the other side of the lobby and rushed through them. I stumbled into a large, empty room with a mirrored ceiling. As I looked across the room and I see her again. She said "We are all just prisoners here of our own device." She pointed to another white door across the room. It's labelled 'Master's Chambers'. I assumed it's the owner's room. 

I slowly peered into the room to find all the whispering occupants of the rooms gathered around the master's table. "Hello. I am the Nightman. Won't you join us?", he said. Next, I saw all the tortured occupants stabbing the monster with their steely knives. 

Last thing I remember I was running for the front door, eyes on the desert road, before I was stopped. "Relax" said the Nightman. "You can check out anytime you like but you can never leave."

I turned back into the hotel to find her and all the ghostly voices congregated in front of me. "Welcome to the Hotel California." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sad. I'd even go so far as to say I'm devastated. I've always gone on hunting trips to the mountains with Nate. Every summer since I was twelve. It's what I looked forward to every year. I don't have whole lot of other friends, none, if I'm being honest. That camping trip has been my only chance to socialize in the summers of recent years as Nate has acquired a more........active social life, so these annual camping trips are the only times we really hang out anymore. And now that's gone.

I'm twenty one and I have just finished college for the summer. I prepare for a hollow, lonely summer. I am just home when Nate rings.

"Hey what's up, Nate ?"
"Hey. How about we go on that trip to the mountains this Saturday ?" He sounds serious, lifeless almost.
"I thought you were too busy ?", I ask trying not to sound too pathetically hopeful.
"No. I changed my mind. I already have everything set up. I insist", he sounds pressing, like he's frustrated.

I don't want to piss Nate off right away as I don't have a whole lot of other friends to spend my summer with and this could be my only chance to see him all summer.

"Okay, sure thing", I say, slightly shaken by his out of character forwardness. "What time should we meet ?"
"Midday. Sharp. Don't be late", he replies.
"O-okay. Looking forward to it."

He hangs up. That was strange. I don't question it though, if tomorrow is the only time I can see my best friend this summer, then tomorrow it is. I'm slightly disappointed that the crux of my whole summer off will come and go within the first two days, but I decide to enjoy it while I can.
                                         ***
I wake up on Saturday buzzing with anticipation and anxiety. My bags are packed and ready to go. I stumble down the stairs and open the wardrobe. I freeze as something catches my eye. My heart turns to ice as my eyes adjust to the man standing outside my window. I slowly turn around, heart in my mouth. He's gone.

I begin to calm down as I gather my things and hesitantly head out to my car. Excitement gradually replaces fear as I drive closer to the mountain. I travel up the winding road leading deeper into the thick, green forest of the mountains and I realise I've had a goofy grin on my face the whole way up here.

I remember that Nate didn't mention exactly where we'd meet. I decide to ring but I hesitate before I press dial. I think about how he sounded yesterday; annoyed, angry, almost as if he was forced to go on this trip with me. I don't know why he'd choose to go if he didn't want to, though. Maybe he broke up with Sally. Yeah, it's probably not me. I reckon it's better to ring him than to leave him waiting so I reluctantly press that green button. It dials for what seemed like hours before he picked up.

"Yes ?", he asks in a deep, husky voice.
"Oh hey, I was just wondering where we were gonna meet ? I think you forgot to tell me yesterday." I try a chuckle in a futile attempt at livening the conversation.
"Last parking lot before the top. Head down the leftmost track. You'll see me."
"Okay tha-"
He hangs up before I could finish.
 
I reach the last parking area and start to unpack my stuff. I look around. I've never been up this far before. There's no cars or any signs indicating trails or routes. Once I lug all my gear out of the boot, I make my way towards the leftmost track.
 
This track is significantly smaller and unbeaten than the rest. I nearly missed it when I drove in. I try to think of good jokes while I make my way along the increasingly narrow pathway. If I'm going to convince Nate to hang out with me again this summer, or, at the very least cheer him up, then I can't afford to be boring or sad.

Finally a camp comes into view. I can see a fire pit as I near closer. I can see Nate's legs now. Shrubbery is blocking my view as I inch closer to the camp. My heart's racing with excited nervousness. As I draw nearer, I notice that he hasn't budged from where he was standing. Surely he would've heard me coming and at least reacted. His legs were deathly still and firmly planted in the ground. 

I pass through the bushes that were obscuring my view. My heart sinks and my feet go cold at the horrific image I witness. I feel light-headed as my brain struggles to process the sight.

"NATE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ?", I scream.

I go from sobbing to catatonic when he looks up at me. Nate was standing over the fire pit, which contained two mangled, headless bodies, which were gushing blood all over the forest floor. Nate was holding one of the the heads in his hands, after taking a bite out of the side of the face. My best friend could never have done this. As my vision ceases to blur, I come to realise that it's not my best friend. It looks identical to Nate except for the long, yellow points instead of teeth and blood stained claws for nails that are sunken into the skull of the decapitated head.

It grins at me, bits of flesh stuck in it's sharp, bone-like teeth. It's eyebrows are furrowed into a frown as it grins an evil, terrifying smile with it's yellow, huge eyes. It lets out a high pitched giggle, like nails scraping a chalkboard, as it crouches, still, in the silent, peaceful forest.

The message to run finally gets from my brain to my legs when the creature bounds towards me. I sprint, not even able to scream from sheer, pure terror. I trip over something and fall into a pile of leaves. It's Nate's phone. I grab it, realising I've dropped my own in all the panic. I manage to get back to my car without looking back and I start the engine and speed down the twisty, turny road back to civilization.

I contemplate ringing the police but, what could I say ? Something that looks like my friend killed someone ? No, I had to go to Nate's house and confront him.

An hour passes and as I pull into Nate's driveway, I find myself still shaking with shock. I barely make it up the steps to the front door of the bungalow without collapsing. I ring the bell. No answer. I ring again. And again. Somewhere around the seventh try, Nate answers the door, seemingly exasperated by such a minor task.

"Hey buddy", he says patronizingly before noticing the obviously petrified look on my face.
"What's wrong ?", he asks, alarmed, his eyes slowly widening.
"Na.....ther......dead......wo....", I begin to sob, knowing he'll never believe a word I say. "There's something in the woods !", I blurt out.
"Wha-what are you talking about ?" He takes a step back.
"There's something in the woods that looks like you. It killed a couple of hikers and it rang me on your phone."
"Wait, wait stop for a second. Some thing that looks like me rang you and killed some people. I think I left my phone in your dorm room when I met you in school last week, anyway."
"No, no. I know it sounds nuts but you have to believe me, please. It had your phone and......"
Sally comes in from the living room, looking concerned.
"What's going on here ?", she inquires.
"Oh hey Sally. This is my friend. You know, the one I've been telling you about ?", Nate says, looking at her. "This is my girlfriend, Sally."

I remain silent.

"Uh listen bud, have you ever thought about going to see a doctor or a therapist. I just think you could really benefit from it", he forces an artificially caring smile.
"Yeah my friend is a psychotherapist. She's really great and she treats all kinds of people", Sally says.

They're talking to me like I'm a child. Ever since Nate broke into his new group of friends, he likes to treat me as if there's something wrong with me and that he only remains friends with me because he feels sorry for me, but we both know he was as lonely and unpopular in school as I was. But I don't mind. If wants to use me to make himself look good in front of his new colleagues then that's fine with me. Right now, I need a friend and he's the best I have.

"Listen, Nate, just come up to the mountains with me and I'll show you."
"Look, I know you love our little trips up to the woods, but like I said, pal, I'm busy. I have a girlfriend now."
"I'm not trying to get you to go on a trip with me...... Nate, just believe me, you're the only friend I have and this concerns you too. You can bring Sally along if it makes you feel better. Please, just humour me this once and you'll see."

Nate thinks. He finally sighs.
 
"Okay. Just this once." 
"Fine, thank you. Uh, you might wanna bring a phone."

The trip up to the mountains is long and quiet. Every now and then Nate would whisper something in Sally's ear. They're probably discussing whether or not to believe me. Just a little longer, then they'll see. Occasionally, Nate would check up on me from the back seat.

"You alright up there bud ?", he'd ask, condecsending me.

Eventually, we reach the car park. It's night time now. It only adds to the eerie atmosphere. I lead them down the same I track the creature lured me down.

As we near the campsite, I can hear my heart beating louder and louder, hammering at my chest. I stop before the bushes that conceal the firepit.

"Okay. This is it", I say.

Nate is trying to act as if he finds it amusing but Sally looks as scared as I feel.

We pass through the brushes and enter the site. There's nothing but a burnt out fire pit and an old, tattered duffel bag.
I hear a muffled sigh of relief from Nate.

"No.....no", I begin to say.

Nate stands up straighter.

"Is this where you saw the bodies, bud ?", he asks, amused. I can hear the smile in his voice.

Now it's my turn to smile.

"No, but that's where they will be", I say as I take the machete out of the duffel bag.

<TEXT> The Gainesville Ripper. Some guy went to a college campus and murdered five students over the course of a couple of days. No one knew who it was until like the third or fourth day..... which is my fav part because for a few days the people in the college had no idea who did it and anyone could've been next  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I gaze as I lay here on the floor,

I gaze longingly at the door,

The door which I dare not try to reach,

For fear of that horrifying screech,

Besides, it would be useless, in vain,
 
To even move would be a grievous strain,

I feel as the cold begins to tug at my toes,

And the smell of blood fills my nose,

I notice the sticky liquid pooling around me,

And the inevitability of death surrounds me,

I don't scream or fight, I focus on the blank space,

I don't  look at the door, I wait for death's embrace,
       
The pain fades and I know I'm near,

The thoughts that were racing become unclear,

But one thought continues to prevail,

What if I hadn't locked myself in this bathroom jail?,

What if I hadn't incanted that dreadful rhyme ?,

I might be living, not dying, not running out of time,

I could've moved passed the mirror, never looked  back,

But instead I saw that woman emerge from the Black
