<TEXT> I haven't read the LotR books but I adore the films. It's a world that I can get sucked into with an epic story and engaging, fun characters. The slow pace is fine because it lets me spend more time in Middle-earth, versus the Nostromo which doesn't necessarily have anything *wrong* with it, I just don't have a reason to care about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, that's another thing... I always hear people talking about how Ripley is one of the greatest female protagonists of all time, but she isn't even the protagonist until more than halfway through Alien (which works for overall unpredictability but not for connecting with the character), and in Aliens she's kind of an asshole. Her delivery of "get away from her, you *bitch!*" was somewhat laughable. Nothing against the actress but I didn't find her character compelling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I watched them both at night in a basement with all the lights off. 99% of the time, this is how I watch movies if I'm not watching them in a theater, and I never have trouble getting sucked in despite the small laptop screen.

Sicario is the most intense movie I've ever seen and that's because it's thoroughly unpredictable. It never shows its hand or hints at what's going to happen next. Alien may be full of original choices that are now considered clichs, but even for its time I can't see how people didn't predict every single death minutes before they happened. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've seen posts like this in the past in which people definitively state "X movie is overrated and fuck you all for liking it." That's arrogant and close-minded and I don't want this to be like that. Honestly, all I want is some rebuttals to my reasons for not liking the movies so I can understand the appeal.

I regularly hear these two movies being referred to as some of the greatest movies of all time, and I figure that's not just a bandwagoning circlejerk--people like these movies for good reason and I just don't see it. For context, I thought Alien was somewhat okay whereas Aliens is legitimately one of the worst movie-watching experiences I've had in the past couple years. Onto my reasoning:

**ALIEN (Theatrical Cut)**

-My biggest problem with this movie is its ridiculously slow pace. I like slow-burn movies when I feel like the meat of them is substantial and the slowness is necessary--many of my all-time favorite movies are slow-burns--but in Alien, the pacing tended to kill my interest rather than building suspense the way it was supposed to. There is some good character development that takes pace within the slowness of the first two acts, but that's not enough to bring me back to this film in the future. I prefer movies to be good the whole time, not just at the end. (Not that I thought this one was good at the end, but I'll get to that in a minute.)

-It's a horror movie, but it isn't scary. A lot of this is due to the fact that the film really hasn't aged well, especially in regard to the puppet effects. The chestburster scene, by far the best thing in the entire film, is completely ruined by the hilariously bad puppet that bursts out. Maybe it was good for 1979, but by 2017 standards, it's the funniest thing I've seen in a movie all year. In that moment I instantly went from feeling appropriately disturbed to laughing out loud and no longer being able to take the movie seriously. The xenomorph, while not quite as campy-looking as the chestburster, was distracting any time it was on screen and I never felt like it was a legitimate threat. Even in the third act when shit is going down, the alien hasn't shown itself enough or done enough (if any) terrifying things for me to be scared of it popping out at any moment; even if it does, I know it's not going to kill Ripley because the sequel is just as famous and Ripley is on the poster. I know that wasn't necessarily an issue pre-1986, but it forever will be now.

-All the deaths and most of the story beats are entirely predictable. I know this is partially because Alien has had a lot of imitators over the years--see *Life (2017)*--but I've made a point of avoiding all of them up to this point, and I still thought Alien telegraphed its every move way too far in advance. Character goes to do something by themselves? Dead. This happens, what, five times? Here's another one: Ripley's been on the shuttle for longer than two minutes and the credits still haven't rolled? The xenomorph is on the shuttle. I'd be shocked if anyone has ever watched this movie and *didn't* see that coming. To be fair, I didn't predict the android twist, which was one of the better plot points, for sure--I also didn't see the fill-the-shuttle-with-random-types-of-gas-until-one-of-them-just-so-happens-to-be-the-weakness-of-the-alien bit coming, although that's purely because it was so stupid and overly convenient.

-The xenomorph isn't a compelling villain. Does it want to eat people so it can grow? No, it grows to full size in a very short window of time, and we never find out how. It didn't eat anybody before then, and they never find a large portion of the ship eaten out, which would have made sense considering its acidic properties. Does it want to kill people because it's an alien that wants to kill people because it's an alien? Yes? Well shit, that's not very interesting. You can have a monster antagonist like that *if it's scary*, but the xenomorph isn't.

-These next few are a lot more nitpicky, but they still stood out to me, so fuck it. -- The device that can detect micro changes in the air is insanely inconsistent. It can detect a cat moving behind a solid iron door (if it was even moving--it was probably just sitting the whole time, wasn't it?), but it can't detect the air moving through the pipes behind the walls that later get punctured and are spewing steam everywhere? Okay, fine. It can detect a cat behind a solid iron door but it can't detect Ripley walking *directly in front of it?* Yes, that happens. Rewatch the movie. (Also, if it could detect "micro changes" in the air, it would definitely be reacting to the air in a room being displaced by people simply moving around in it... but if I actually liked this movie I wouldn't be complaining about something like that, so I'll let it slide, I guess.)

-The tagline of the movie is "In space, no one can hear you scream." Which is probably the best tagline you could ever come up with for a horror movie set in space. But when the Nostromo explodes, it makes explosion noises. So... that sort of diminishes the awesomeness of that line, doesn't it?

-And lastly, some other nitpicky things, like when Ripley is singing at the end but it's layered on top of multiple shots in which her mouth clearly isn't moving... or what was the cat eating while everybody was in hypersleep...? K, I'm done. Bottom line is I found the movie not very suspenseful and not at all scary, and there's nothing about it that would ever draw me back to it. I can go rewatch the chestburster scene on YouTube and immediately click away when the puppet shows up, and that'll be a more positive experience than I had watching the full movie.

**ALIENS (Director's Cut)**

-The biggest problem I have with Aliens is, once again, the slowness of it. It's much more of an issue for me this time around, because while Alien was a slow-burn horror suspense film and therefore much more forgivable when it comes to pacing, Aliens is an action film. An action film in which no action takes place until 75 minutes in, and even then it's only a smattering of it until 45 minutes later when the third act finally happens and slightly lifts the movie out of the grave it's been digging for itself.

-From a cinematography perspective, the first film was quite visually appealing. All of that is lost here. There are some impressive visual effects every now and again, but as a whole the movie looks and feels thoroughly dead and joyless. I was unpleasantly reminded of Suicide Squad many times while watching Aliens, and that's never a good sign. More on that in the next paragraph.

-It rehashes many of the plot elements from the first film, but doesn't do anything at all to build on them or change them in a significant way. This is especially frustrating when you consider that essentially everything about the first film is better... except for the puppet effects, which still aren't fully believable in this movie but are much better than in Alien. Still, the characters in Alien are better (Bill Paxton was great though, probably the only thing about Aliens I actually loved), the story is more streamlined, the setting is more claustrophobic... as much as I don't love the first film, almost everything about it feels deliberate and meticulously executed. Aliens is technically and narratively a complete mess. I honestly don't see what sets it apart from something like Suicide Squad. They share the same haphazard action, bland color palette, mostly disposable characters, and disjointed pacing. The only difference is that Aliens' script isn't complete garbage and Ripley is a bit more compelling than Harley Quinn.

-The girl who plays Newt is far from being the worst child actress ever, but she's still not very good. She's only ever doing one of two things: whisper-mumbling or screaming at the top of her goddamn lungs. "They mostly come at night... mostly" is a great line, but her delivery completely kills any amount of dread that line should have induced in me.

-Ripley realizes that guns going off within a certain area will set the whole place ablaze, and after explaining it to mission-control-man-whose-name-I-can't-remember, he informs the soldiers that they are not to fire their guns. He doesn't explain why, though, so the soldiers give their bullets to the squad commander and then immediately share backup bullets with each other. I'm not sure why they were hiding bullets in the first place, but in any case, they still have bullets and they obviously see no reason not to fire them. Minutes later, they're attacked by xenomorphs, but they don't fire the bullets. Is there any reasoning behind this other than the plot needing them not to be dead yet? Maybe I missed something.

-In the final sequence, Ripley's leg is grabbed by the xenomorph, conveniently while she's right next to a lever that opens the airlock. But after she gets rid of the xenomorph, she has to dramatically climb all the way up the ladder to reach a *different* control panel so she can close the airlock with a different door. Why not just pull the lever again and close the door she initially opened?

-----------

Props to anyone who actually read this. I really wish I could like these movies and maybe I'll watch them again in the future, but for the time being I'd really appreciate it if somebody could please explain why my reasons are wrong, or in any case, why the movies are actually good (by modern standards, not just by 70s/80s standards). I don't love being in the minority when it comes to movies that everybody expect me seems to love for reasons I don't understand. This is the most extreme case I've come across so far. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Between the Ringed Inner Wall and Ringed City Streets bonfire, in the area with the respawning Harald Legion Knights, I can see a higher area that I have no idea how to access. I know I should be able to access it because I can see a ladder up there. For context, I already did the segment with the Crystal Lizard that runs toward the Ringed Knight across the bridge above where the Harald Legion Knights spawn--I'm talking about the area above that.

I can't find any other threads asking about it, so I know the answer is probably incredibly obvious, but I can't for the life of me find the entrance. How do I get up there? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand the purpose of it, but I think the darkness you're talking about dominates too much of the film to the point where it stops accomplishing that or being worth it when it does pay off. Ronan's stereotypical villain persona exists purely to set up the dance scene at the end, but his stereotypical villain scenes are still in the movie, so was it really worth it? In my opinion, no. But I'm not saying anybody else is wrong for thinking that and similar attempts *do* work, or for liking the movie as a whole. The video isn't a personal attack on the fanbase, regardless of how people seem to be taking it. </TEXT>

I'm having a hard time deciding where to put this in my episode rankings, because all things considered (direction, writing, acting, pacing, etc.) I think this is objectively the best episode of Black Mirror by far; yet in the future I probably won't rewatch it as much as something like White Christmas.

My only complaint is that we don't get to see Kelly and Yorkie meet up for the first time after Kelly decides to commit herself to San Junipero. That had the potential to be such a powerful moment and I would have liked the episode to end with that before seeing the clips that were sprinkled through the credits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Go the furthest southeast you can go on the map. From the Hateno Research Lab you can see a small, isolated island with a Shrine on it--from there you can see Eventide. Honestly, if you've beaten the game you probably have enough heart containers that it won't give you too much trouble.

I found another special challenge in the far northeast corner of the map today, so I'm guessing there are challenges at all corners. Can't wait to see what the other two are. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Eventide challenge is the most engaged I've ever been in a Zelda game. I literally stood on a cliff and threw bombs at the boss for 15 minutes until he died because I was so scared of dying and having to start all the way over.

For those wondering, Eventide is (I think) the furthest southeast you can go. You can see it from the tiny island with the Shrine visible from the Hateno Research Lab. </TEXT>

Make sure you retrieve at least one memory and then talk to Impa, and she'll give you the Hero shirt, which allows you to see enemy HP and has way better defense than any of the other early game clothing items.

EDIT: You also should have gotten some basic clothes from the chests in the Shrine of Resurrection... if you've been pants-less this whole time, then yes, you should be worried. </TEXT>

If you're a PC gamer, The Witcher 3 is your best bet. That's the game I'm reminded of the most while playing Breath of the Wild, more so than previous Zelda games, honestly. </TEXT>

<TITLE> (19M) Been on three dates with crush (18F), she wants to date more frequently but "isn't really looking for a relationship," what does it mean? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-08 01:54:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Before I start, it's worth mentioning that I've never been in a relationship, I've only been on 11 dates in my life including the three listed below, and overall I just have no clue what the fuck I'm doing. Hope that helps.

So there's this girl at work whom I met in November. I've had a bit of a crush on her ever since I met her and we got along really well right from the first conversation. One day at work, mid-December, I won two tickets to Rogue One in a gift exchange, and she wanted the other one, so I invited her to come with me. We both agreed that it was a date, not just hanging out--she was the first one to call it a date, actually, and obviously I went with it. We went out a second time three weeks later (a simple lunch date) and again last Friday (semi-fancy dinner and then a different movie I'd been wanting her to see).

All three dates went really well, especially the most recent one, and the week leading up to it we had been talking at work even more than usual. It's not a very socialization-friendly work environment, but ever since the first date we've gone out of our way to say hi to each other and we've had a few long conversations when working in the same area. Honestly, she probably figured out that I like her a long time ago, since I'm usually very closed off at work but I talk to her fairly often whereas I rarely talk to any of my other coworkers, and after asking her out three times... yeah, it's probably pretty obvious.

So, since we'd been getting along so well and the third date was so much fun for both of us, I decided to open up a little bit about my feelings at the end. Basically I told her that I love spending time with her and didn't want to wait three weeks to ask her out again. She seemed very flattered and said that she loves spending time with me too and would also love to go out more frequently, but then she said, "you should probably know that I'm not really looking for a relationship right now, because I just got out of a two-year-long one and it kind of ripped my soul apart."

We've texted a little bit since then but I haven't seen her in person yet (she works part-time) and I'm freaking the fuck out trying to decide how to proceed. I ruined my last chance at a relationship because I was too overbearing, so I've been trying really hard not to be, which is why I waited three weeks between each date instead of calling her immediately the next day. But since she gave me the go-ahead on dating more, I'm really tempted to call her tonight even though it's only been a few days.

And of course the part that's been stressing me out the most is the fact that she's apparently not looking for a relationship. I know she isn't lying about the two-year boyfriend, but I don't know how recent it was and I can't help but wonder if she's interested in a relationship, just not with me, and she's trying to let me down slowly. Or maybe she is interested in a relationship with me but she just wants more time away from her last one and more time getting to know me before she makes another commitment...? I can't see why she would want to go out more often if she wasn't at least a little interested, but she's also a very nice person who could definitely be going with it just to make me feel better.

I'm confused. Help pls.

TL;DR - Been on three dates with my coworker whom I am very fond of at this point, told her at the end of the third date that I love spending time with her and would like to go out more frequently, she was flattered and said she loves spending time with me too and also wants to go out more often but she "isn't really looking for a relationship right now" because she just got out of a two-year-long one and it "ripped her soul apart". How to proceed? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about buying the DLC </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-29 09:11:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just beat Mergo's Wet Nurse and I'm aware that I'm not supposed to enter the final boss arena until I've played the DLC. I've held off on buying it just in case it went on sale during my playthrough, but it didn't, so at this point I'm cool with paying full price.

Problem is, I don't know if buying it at this point in the game will automatically add the Eye of a Blood-Drunk Hunter to my inventory, or if the game will require me to beat Vicar Amelia again in a new playthrough. If it doesn't give it to me right away, I'll hold off on buying it until it actually does go on sale, or until I feel like playing Bloodborne again, which may not be for a while. I don't want to waste $20, so if anybody knows the answer to this I'd appreciate it.

TL;DR - Already beat Vicar Amelia, chilling before triggering final boss--does buying the DLC give me the Eye of a Blood-Drunk Hunter right away or nah? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The main reason I'm upset is because we had to wait a lot longer for AB+ than we did for AB, but it's so much lamer in comparison. If this had come out three months after Afterbirth, I'd be okay with it, but when it took less than a year for Afterbirth to come out and this took *more* than a year, the lack of quality is a lot less forgivable.

I agree, though, it's not a massive deal and there's no reason the devs should be getting death threats.

EDIT: Jesus fuck, why all the downvotes? I think my explanation of why I'm disappointed in AB+ is perfectly reasonable. Am I supposed to clarify that I was referring to AB+ taking more than a year *after the release of Afterbirth*, not Rebirth? I thought that was obvious, but maybe not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's the "Victory Lap" feature. Anytime you beat The Lamb, it will ask you if you want to do it. You can do multiple Victory Laps in a row, but the runs get harder each time and you get turned into The Lost on the third lap.

Also, every time you start a new victory lap, make sure you quit and select "Continue", or else never-before-seen items that you pick up won't get added to your item catalog. I think it's a bug. </TEXT>

<TITLE> PSA: Something you should know about doing a third victory lap </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-05 00:32:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So basically I was going to do at least five victory laps in a row, hoping to maybe get the "Five Nights at Mom's" achievement. But I died right at the start of my third victory lap because, spoiler alert, the game turned me into The Lost (which I had no way of knowing because I had Curse of the Unknown).

Not sure if it persists through the fourth victory lap and onward, if this applies with all characters (I was Apollyon), if it's always the third victory lap, etc. Also there seemed to be a glitch where not all of my items carried over from the original run and/or past victory laps.

And while we're on the subject: never-before-seen items picked up during a victory lap ONLY COUNT IF you quit out of the victory lap and select "Continue" at some point during the lap, BEFORE picking up the item. You have to do this every time a new victory lap starts. I'm pretty sure you can get completion marks without quitting out first, though.

Oh, and I still have no idea if doing five victory laps actually triggers the "Five Nights at Mom's" achievement, as it was just a guess. But apparently I don't get to find out today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I once dreamed the exact layout of a church parking lot and a nearby field in Schenectady, New York several months before my family went on vacation to New York and attended church in that building. It was very different than any other parking lot I've ever seen and I had never been to that part of New York, but I dreamed every single detail. I was religious back then and assumed that God had sent me a vision just for fun. This thread made me think about it for the first time since becoming atheist and I have no idea what to make of it.

Another time, while hanging out in my living room, I heard a swelling electric noise, growing increasingly louder. I looked up and saw a crackling ball of green light growing next to the computer monitor across the room, and after a few seconds it disappeared with a loud popping sound. I was noticeably freaked out and my sister, who was sitting closer to the computer than I was, asked what was wrong. She hadn't heard a thing and didn't believe me until we tried turning the monitor on and it didn't work. We had to get a new one.

I guess it's also worth mentioning that I just barely watched The Matrix for the first time a couple nights ago, so the timing of this post and the number of weird stories in the comments are kind of freaking me out. </TEXT>

If I was just being my real self and explaining the gospel to them the way I would to a friend in a normal conversation, they were never interested.

The Spirit is supposed to testify of truth, but it only ever seemed to when I was emotionally manipulating people on purpose. It was impossible for me to ignore and was one of my first steps toward leaving. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 8 is the age of accountability at which people can be baptized into the Church. My understanding was always that this is because up to that point, the human brain can't make reasonable, well thought-out decisions. Obviously some people develop that ability at a much earlier age, and some much later, but that's beside the point.

If our ability to make important decisions is contingent upon the development of our human brains, how could we have been trusted to make the decision of whether to follow Jesus' plan or Satan's plan? That's the most important decision any of God's children will ever make, and he let them make it before giving them the ability to make decisions?

I can't believe this never occurred to me. TSCC is so full of shit.

EDIT: Yes, it makes sense that we were smarter in our spirit forms than we were as human babies. But if that's the case, physical bodies are a limitation on our intelligence, and we shouldn't have to praise God for giving them to us. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [SPOILER ALERT] My biggest sin for the movie is the fucking Obliviation rain at the end.

Earlier in the film he has this extremely poisonous venom that he says "probably has some use if diluted enough," but by the end he suddenly knows exactly what it does and exactly how diluted it needs to be, and for whatever reason, breaking the vial inside a cloud evenly distributes it throughout the cloud and immediately causes it to start raining. He says "you know what to do" to the phoenix hippogriff thing when he gives it the vial, but how the hell would it?

So then it's raining venom, but it's diluted enough to wipe people's memories instead of killing them, apparently. But it's not an Obliviation spell from a wand being controlled by someone, so nobody is controlling which memories are being erased. Do people lose more memories the longer they stand out in the rain? How many of these poor fuckers out on the street are going to forget where they live and what their families look like?

Meanwhile, a bunch of witches and wizards are walking through the city, Doctor Strange-ing it back to normal. But the rain is hitting them too, and we know from the Harry Potter movies that wizards are just as susceptible to Obliviation as Muggles are. Why aren't their memories being wiped?

We also see shots of people *inside their houses* losing their memories. Does the rain have an aura of forgetfulness instead of needing to physically come in contact with you? Fine, I can live with that. But then how can Jacob stand mere inches away from it without losing his memory for the sake of a dramatic scene?!

And then the rain takes longer to wipe his memory than it did for anyone else, purely for dramatic effect, and he doesn't just forget about magic, he also forgets about all of his new friends. If the rain is capable of that, some poor bastards DEFINITELY just forgot their families.

Fuck this movie. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-11-14 04:32:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So it's pretty obvious that Ford is building a host version of Theresa so he can avoid suspicion. This got me thinking: Bernard is the inquisitive type, and even as a host he's been figuring out things he isn't necessarily meant to know (even if Ford is technically controlling it). What if he wasn't always a host? I think Bernard used to be a real human employee and figured out something he wasn't meant to know, facilitating a dramatic murder by Ford much like the one we saw of Theresa tonight.

I also wonder how many times this has happened. Ford mentioned the board's many investigations; has a board member been killed and replaced on each of those investigations? How many board members are hosts directly under his control at this point?

I think Ford is even more of a god than we know, and it's starting to scare me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can't accurately make that comparison without knowing how many people on this sub rejoined the Church without unsubscribing (probably very few), how many people left the Church without joining this sub (probably tons), how many people the Church still counts among its membership despite their inactivity (pretty much all of them), etc.

But then it's not even a fair comparison, considering the Church has over 80,000 missionaries out teaching all over the world, and this sub has exactly zero. If you adjust the growth based on those modifiers, I think there's a clear winner here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I bought Dark Souls last June during a sale. It took me 10 hours to get to the Bell Gargoyles fight and another 2 hours to die enough times to give up completely.

I picked up the game again in August and played the series (DS1, DS2, and DS3) to completion over the course of the next month or so.

Today I started a new save as part of RTL, mostly just out of curiosity for how far I've come as a Dark Souls player.

Made it to Bell Gargoyles in about 2 hours, beat them on the first try. So unbelievably satisfying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every "fuck" that came out of the writer guy and producer lady (the two characters who have the conversation on the balcony) felt really forced and unnatural, right? I can't put my finger on whether it was the writing or the acting, or maybe it was both, but I cringed every time they said it. The nudity and violence felt completely earned and necessary, but so far the cursing seems to be there out of obligation more than anything else.

That being said, the episode was brilliant and I can't wait to see more. It's great that something as trivial as this is my biggest complaint. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Spider-Man 2**

Finally decided to watch all the Spider-Man movies this week and this was not only the best of the bunch, but one of the best superhero films I've ever seen. Peter Parker struggling with his powers was handled well and Doc Ock was a fantastic villain.

**127 Hours**

God damn, what a harrowing piece of artistry. Entertaining as hell, though. Definitely the best I've ever seen James Franco; it's not every day you can watch a guy stand in one place for an hour and be completely engrossed. I've watched about 60 movies this year and this is easily in the top 10 of those. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know many will disagree with me on this, but one of the things I like least about the Souls games is having to run through so much of an area to get back to a boss fight. It makes the game harder but for me it's not in a fun way. I love the boss fights and want to be able to try them again instantly, so it kills my enthusiasm to have to memorize how to run through the level without getting hit, which usually isn't too difficult but becomes monotonous and puts too much of a gap between attempts. I wish they would put the boss bonfire right before the fog door instead of having it spawn once you complete the boss. That's just my opinion.

A boss rush mode would more or less solve this problem for me, because I wouldn't have to run through levels just to have a chance at fighting them. I think it's a great idea. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was an eye-opener for me on my mission. We committed my first new investigator to come to church, but he ended up not coming (supposedly he was sick but I'm 90% sure he was lying). Either way, that was my first Sunday in the ward, and it was so filled with weirdos and freaks that I was actually glad our investigator hadn't come. I knew that if I knew barely anything about the Church and walked into that ward, I would never go near the Church again.

This got me thinking: why would any of the groups in God's one true church be that way? So utterly repulsive and unattractive that there's no way you could ever get more people to join it? My companion said the Spirit would help. It didn't.

One of many shelf items I gained on my mission. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No-Man's Wharf bugged the ever-living shit out of me. It was the third area I went to and it kicked my ass something fierce. It's actually not bad as far as level design goes, but the enemy placement is absolutely ridiculous for a level so early in the game. Granted, I had unwittingly joined the Company of Champions with no clue of what it did, so that probably didn't help... but it felt so good to finally get past that godforsaken area. At least the boss is easy and there's a shortcut so you can just run to him.

A few tips:

-It's worth it to use the Pharros Lockstone on the second floor. It adds a lot of much-needed lighting to the area and forces the Darkstalkers into the houses, making later parts of the level much more manageable.

-Speaking of which, if you're doing a Strength build, it's worth your time to explore the uppermost house full of Darkstalkers as one of the chests at the top holds a Greatsword, a very good PvE weapon.

-Be sure to kick down the bridge for the shortcut toward the end of the area. If you're not worried about collecting everything, you can just run all the way through the level without killing anything. Be sure to run semi-unpredictably, as the archers often shoot in anticipation of where you *will* be and running in a straight line pretty much guarantees you'll get hit.

That's all I got. Good luck and I hope you have as much fun never going back to No-Man's Wharf as I did. </TEXT>

I'm about halfway between that and the end of the game, and so far, nothing has even come close to being as hard. Four Kings was obnoxious as hell but mostly because I hate the aesthetic of New Londo Ruins and I got sick of running through it over and over. The fight itself wasn't too bad once I got used to it. Good luck on the rest of your journey! </TEXT>

Got it to +10 and five two-handed hits with that bad boy was enough to kill Ornstein in the first phase. Smough got stuck behind a pillar on the last three hits, so that wasn't too bad. Then it was just a matter of being lucky enough for Pika-Smough not to do his electricity butt-stomp or charge attack too many times (because I suck at dodging those). </TEXT>

<TEXT> After hours of failure, I finally managed to beat Ornstein   Smough completely by myself with no phantoms summoned. The feeling inside me as Pika-Smaug turned to ash is the most elated I have ever felt in my life.

I didn't like this game when I started. Oh, how the tables have turned. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a fair point. I guess what I meant is that any single item you see only has a 1/250 chance of being Mega Blast. And the chance increases the more items you pick up, yes, but that 1/5 makes the difference pretty negligible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you tried the Eden method? It's a lot more effective than fighting your way to devil deals over and over. To be precise:

Mega Blast is 1/5 as likely to spawn as any other devil room item, and there are 50 devil room items total, so that's only a 1 in 250 chance of seeing it appear any time you enter a devil room (assuming you don't get Krampus).

On the contrary, there are 87 active items in the game, and Eden always starts with one. Mega Blast is just as likely as any of the others. So the trick is to restart with Eden over and over until Mega appears. If you've played the game this far, chances are you have more than 87 Eden tokens, so the odds should be in your favor.

That's how I finished 1001%. Good luck! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Help! Trying to play without Afterbirth and game won't launch! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-22 22:24:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> EDIT: I figured it out. Turns out the mods I had installed didn't delete themselves when I reinstalled--removed those and the game is working again. I'll just leave this here in case somebody else has the same problem in the future.

-

I've played the hell out of Afterbirth and enjoyed it very much, but I'm out of things to do (1001% on all save files and I've had my fill of Eden streaks). I want to go back to the original Rebirth for a while before AB+ comes out since I never did get Real Platinum God.

But here's the problem: I've unchecked the Afterbirth DLC to uninstall it, and now the game won't run. The "Binding of Isaac Rebirth" window opens for a brief moment before going white and producing the error message "isaac-ng.exe has stopped working." The game works again if I reinstall Afterbirth, but I can't get it to work without it.

Things I've tried that didn't solve the problem:

-Deleting all local files and reinstalling without Afterbirth checked

-Verifying integrity of game cache, before and after reinstalling (the error message takes longer to come up when I do this but otherwise nothing changes)

-Restarting Steam

-Manually backing up and then deleting the files in *C:/Users/XXX/My Documents/My Games/Binding of Isaac Rebirth* before launching, as suggested by loads of people when Rebirth first came out in 2014

Playing on a Windows 10 laptop that far exceeds the recommended system requirements.

<TEXT> Given that he's in Love   Monsters for about two minutes and the writing in his scene is abysmal, I'd say that rule doesn't really apply in that episode. I'd mostly agree with that statement otherwise, though. Problem is, I hate the direction they've taken with Capaldi's Doctor; I loved the dark humor in "The Caretaker" because it suited him so perfectly, but in what I saw of series 9 I felt like they had done some major backpedaling and tried to force Matt Smith comedy into his persona. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a tough situation because from a story perspective, the wise decision would be to tell a whole new one. Less risk of it being a disappointment. But one of the biggest reasons this show is so great is because of the amazing characters and the people who play them, and it's ridiculous to expect them to find an equally great (or better) cast every season. Besides, I can't imagine Stranger Things without Eleven... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never fully believed but I wanted to be a good spiritual example that my parents could love as much as their other kids. So I made the best-worst decision of my life and went on a mission, ultimately coming home way early because I became suicidal. A month later I decided I was done ignoring "anti-Mormon material" because if it was correct then that would explain why the Church was trying so hard to keep me away from it. Within about two days I was more sure the Church isn't true than I ever was that it is true. The hardest part was dealing with my family's reaction (still an uphill battle every day) but otherwise it was a smooth and relieving transition and I've truly never been happier.

I wish it could be that way for everybody. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just barely finished it as well and god damn, what an incredible show. This is legitimately some of the most well-structured and beautiful storytelling I've seen in my life, and everything from the cinematography to the writing to the acting was consistently spot-on (and holy shit, how did they find so many good child actors?! Especially Eleven, she gave the best performance of anyone in the show imo).

It felt a tad predictable at times, and there were a lot of clichd beats. The villains served their purpose in the end but I wish they had been less generically evil. However, the protagonists were such great characters and the story was so good that those things didn't really affect my enjoyment when all was said and done. This show is amazing and I can't wait for season 2. </TEXT>

Some of my favorite television episodes of all time come from this show and there are some incredible moments and scenes even in the less desirable episodes.

<TEXT> But you realize that Overwatch had a closed beta for several months and the people who played that are still into it, right? Regardless of which game is better (I like them roughly the same, personally) Overwatch has a much bigger player base than Splatoon ever did, and it's impossible for it to "go the way of its brethren where the servers are completely dead a month after release" when the full game has been out for over two months.

Maybe think twice and do some research before calling somebody else ignorant. </TEXT>

He does the rehearsed testimony thing every month, with added nuggets of meaningless bullshit such as "I know that when you touch the temple, the temple touches you." So, being alone with him, I casually asked how he felt about the Church these days. He immediately responded "well I know the Church is true" like a fucking robot.

I asked, "But what does that actually mean to you?"

...No answer. He got this dumb look on his face like it had never occurred to him to think about even the most basic meaning of the phrase. Indoctrination is fun! </TEXT>

But I could never get past the fact that A) they lived in a really small house, B) they definitely could not afford to feed that many mouths, and C) there's no way one dad and one mom could give all the individual attention necessary to 22 kids under the age of 18, most of which were disabled in some capacity. The whole family always looked miserable and I could never understand why everybody was so happy for them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My trainer on my mission, who prided himself on letter-of-the-law things like always doing "a full 24-hour fast", said Game of Thrones was his favorite show. He also said Fight Club was his favorite movie, so I guess he didn't have much of an issue with adult-rated media in general.

I watched the first season and a half of Game of Thrones when I was still TBM. I didn't stop because I was bothered, I stopped because I felt like it was mostly boring. A few months ago I came around and watched the entire series from start to finish and now it's my favorite show under Breaking Bad (which I also watched as a TBM). </TEXT>

Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask are both great games (especially if you play the 3DS versions) but I had a hard time getting into them when I wasn't as big of a Zelda fan. Unless you have a personally deeper appreciation for older N64-era games, Twilight Princess should be your next Zelda. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know there have been a million posts exactly like this in the past and I'm sure there will be a million more. And... I have nothing more to add to that statement. I'm not unique to the situation I'm in. Whatever, moving on.

I just had a conversation with my parents in which we discussed how much college is going to cost, and in the same conversation they revealed that they are choosing to withdraw most of the financial support they had originally promised--they were going to pay for half of my college and now it's down to one-seventh for reasons they're not telling me. Also in this conversation, they gave me the wonderful news that although my sister was allowed to use one of the family cars during all four years of college, they will not extend the same privilege to me (again, for reasons they refused to talk about).

I don't have a job right now. I've been looking all over for one but I'm at a bit of a disadvantage because there are very few things in this world I hate more than working in fast food and I'm too prideful to resign myself to it. I've done it in the past and it makes me want to die (huh, fitting). Recently I've come very close to getting jobs that I actually would have enjoyed doing, such as being a customer service rep, an overnight truck driver, and a few others; but I always get fucked out of it at the last second because it turns out I'm not old enough or something like that. Just today I was about to be hired for something great on the spot and then--"Oh, you're 19? I'm so sorry, come back when you're 21 and we'll give you the job." I keep hoping that I'll eventually find a job I don't hate if I look hard enough, but my parents (whom I live with at the moment because I'm completely broke) are tired of waiting. Could I walk into McDonald's tomorrow, hand a manager my resume and get the job instantly? Probably. But it's not that simple to me.

Bottom line is that the more I think about how my life is going to progress, the less I want to experience it. Now that I'm out of high school, I have to spend most of my time working shitty jobs so I can make enough money to do the most difficult schoolwork of my life for 4-8 years so I can work a slightly less shitty job for the rest of my life so that I can actually afford to spend any time at all doing what I want. I get it, that's how the world works, but that's not how I want MY life to go, and I'm really starting to feel like the only way I can avoid the way of the world is to leave it behind.

"Life's hard and sometimes you have to do things even when you really don't want to." Yada yada yeah, I know. To be able to do the things I want, I have to spend a lot of time doing the things I don't. I'm just not sure if I think it's worth it anymore.

I don't want to go to college. I don't want to work 40 hours a week for 40 years. I don't want to live in a world where I have no choice but to spend more time being miserable so I can spend less time being happy.

Any advice with a bit more substance than "forget yourself and go to work" would be appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I left the Church four months ago, I was still holding on to various tidbits of "evidence" that there is a god. But I'm finding that the more I rethink existence in general and my place in the universe, the less I think of those things as evidence. Any sort of connection I ever felt like I had to a higher power is completely gone and I'm realizing that it was all a misinterpretation of emotions in the first place.

It feels really good to think progressively. Huge thanks to all of you for helping me get to the point where I can do so. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 10 - Literally perfect and I want to watch it on repeat and/or talk about it for the rest of my life
9 - One of the best films I've ever seen, hardly any flaws and resonated with me deeply
8 - Above average film, generally very high praise with perhaps a few reservations
7 - Below average film, plenty of redeeming qualities but it just didn't work for me as a whole
6 - Pretty shitty and/or non-enjoyable film, sometimes a fun watch with no substance
5 - Bad enough that I complain about it for weeks
4 - Bad enough to give me a headache and make me regret watching
3 - Complete trash, not worth mine or anybody's time
2 - How the fuck did this get made
1 - Star Wars Holiday Special

The highest I've ever ranked a film is 9.2. I've only ranked three films 9 or higher. 7.8 is what most good movies get; a bit odd but it works for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I could argue the pin thing for hours, but you said yourself you don't want to defend it so I'll avoid that.

I would like to know what you would have me do differently, though, for the sake of future videos. Keep in mind these are supposed to be JonTron and/or CinemaSins-esque videos where I'm not critiquing so much as nitpicking in a semi-comedic fashion. After all, the point is for me to hate on it, not to be Chris Stuckmann.

Obviously if you don't like that style of video, that's totally fine. But if you do have any feedback for what should be different about it, I'd love to hear it. </TEXT>

The writing, pacing, and characters all have loads of issues and the story has too many inconsistencies for me to take it seriously.

<TEXT> Haha sorry, my original script mentioned The Iron Giant but I think I took it out because it messed with the flow. It's also been forever since I've seen it so I can't really speak to its quality, although I loved it as a kid.

And that's a fair point. I tend to avoid CinemaSins videos for films that I love for that same reason. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't love it but I certainly didn't dislike it. I was a big fan of the book when I was in elementary school and I think a part of me just wanted to see a version better than that terrible animated one from the 80s.

This is one of the most visually impressive films I've seen in a long time and Mark Rylance was brilliant in his role. The girl who played Sophie did quite a good job as well. My praise mostly stops there, though.

This is probably the most thematically shallow movie I've seen this year. Aside from a beautiful portrayal of friendship, nothing in the storytelling of The BFG interested me. The palace sequence in the third act was especially cringeworthy and overlong, and the climax was too quick and scattered. I thought Sophie was going to try and remove the "no forgiveness" part of the dream at the end, which would have left a good message about everyone deserving a chance for redemption, but nope, those giants are permanently screwed. It was oddly dissatisfying for me.

Overall this is a good film that I never need to watch again. 7.3/10 </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Game of Thrones*

The Winds of Winter has replaced Ozymandias as my favorite television episode of all time. A perfect ending to another great season.

*Better Call Saul*

I've put off watching this show for far too long. Finally watched the pilot tonight and really enjoyed it--not as much as Breaking Bad's pilot, but obviously I wasn't expecting to. The last ten minutes in particular were really strong and I'm excited to keep watching. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Now that we have another fantastic season on our hands, I'm curious to know where everybody ranks it among the others. My ranking from best to worst is as follows:

4, 3, 6, 1, 2, 5

"The Winds of Winter" is now my favorite episode of the entire show, and last week's "Battle of the Bastards" is definitely somewhere in my top three. But I felt that the rest of season 6 was slightly lacking--definitely good, but not as great as the buildup episodes of seasons 3 and 4. Regardless, these last two episodes put the whole season above seasons 1, 2, and 5 for me, and by a pretty significant margin.

But I want to know what everybody else thinks! Some are calling it the best season of the show. I haven't heard anybody call it the worst, but if that's your opinion, make it known!

Post your rankings from best to worst below, along with your thoughts on season 6 and why you placed it where you did. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well technically you don't start with Wooden Nickel until you've beaten Isaac with him. So you have to get most of the way through a Polaroid run without that advantage before you ever have it.

Basically he's like The Lost in that he can only take two hits before he dies and can never obtain more health, but The Lost is guaranteed to get the Holy Mantle proc in every room, while Keeper isn't necessarily guaranteed to get a coin every room. This also means The Lost can safely explore Curse rooms while Keeper cannot. The Lost also has flight and spectral tears and can take devil deals for free--Keeper has triple shot (and therefore a shit tear rate), no flight, no spectral tears, and can only take 1-heart devil deals without dying. And after that, he can only take one hit, so really you can't even take those deals unless you have a Strength card (gives a permanent health-up to Keeper) or a health-up item laying around somewhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a lot of hate out there for Skyward Sword but it's actually my favorite game of all time. The biggest complaint I see is that the motion controls suck, but I completely disagree. The trick is being the correct distance away from the sensor bar; if you're too close or too far, you'll spend the entire game being too pissed at the lack of functionality to enjoy it at all. Do yourself a favor early on and find the sweet spot, and then enjoy an incredible game with no technical hassle. </TEXT>

He sends me a lot of emails linking to FairMormon pages and Hugh Nibley talks and lots of other useless apologist crap. The other day I sent him an email refuting many of his claims, and at the end I politely asked him to stop sending me those emails because they're a waste of time for both of us.

Today I found out from my sister that my parents were very offended by the email and they said this would be reason enough to kick me out if I wasn't moving out in two weeks already.

Obviously nowhere near as terrible as your parents, but similar in some ways, I think. </TEXT>

Passive item that permanently turns coins, bombs, and keys into "pickup credits" - a multipurpose pickup that can be all three. This combines your current amounts into one.

Performing actions such as spending money, using bombs, and opening locked doors drains your credit count. Collecting any of the three pickups will add to the credit count in their specific value (1+1 bombs/coins add 2, nickels and dimes add 5 and 10 respectively, etc.) Max credit count is 300. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The power of prayer </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-05 05:07:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Our family recently decided to buy a dog, and we've spent a couple weeks looking at various options. Today we decided on an online transaction that looked very appealing in many ways. But before we officially decided to go through with it, my parents, being the TBMs they are, made sure to pray about it. They were both adamant about how important that was and they repeated multiple times that they both felt very good about it after praying. So we told the person we were interested and the payment process began.

Turns out it was a scam. I discovered that the video she had posted of the available puppies was actually uploaded to YouTube over five years ago and this seller had stolen the video and claimed that they had taken it. We even asked specifically (our communication was exclusively over text) if the video was of the exact dogs she was selling, and she said yes and that she had filmed it three weeks ago. I called her out on her bullshit and she got angry and took down the online ad so we couldn't report her. (Luckily this happened before we actually paid her, so everything is fine.)

Just goes to show how useless and wrong spiritual confirmation actually is. Funny thing is, if I was still out on my mission right now like I was supposed to be, I wouldn't have been here to find the video and expose the seller, and my family would have figured it out the hard way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A golden investigator is someone who is very accepting of the Church right from the start; someone who basically fits the Mormon mold already but just has to be taught the doctrine and they'll be immediately baptized.

I learned a lot of very disappointing things about the Church on my mission. One of them is that a lot of missionaries care more about baptisms as numbers on their reports and/or bragging rights to their family and other missionaries far more than as actual people being cleansed from sin. Similarly, a lot of members like it when new members show up, but only because it increases the size of the congregation or the overall Church membership; they often want nothing to do with the new convert as a person.

If you're still investigating, I'd recommend getting out ASAP. The Church is an absolute hellhole and I can promise that you and your kids will be far better off learning the truth now rather than 20 years down the road or even not at all. And if you don't want to research Church history, just read some (or all) of the CES Letter (www.cesletter.com, download the PDF), in which the research has already been done for you and laid out very clearly and irrefutably. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Elder Bednar - Discouraging missionaries from the honest seeking of truth since 2016 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-16 10:09:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> One of my best friends is on his mission right now and this came as part of his weekly email on Monday. Considering that I've just barely been exposed to the truth about the Church and that I'm just now starting to see the manipulation and brainwashing present, this made me pretty upset:

Elder Bednar came to our mission. That was pretty freaking amazing. 
It would be hard to condense all the things he said into one email, so I won't try (although he did prophesy, and that was awesome; there's something cool about an actual prophet prophesying right in front of you) but I wanted to share one cool insight.
He told us one time that he was meeting with a group of inactive RM's in a stake somewhere in the US. He walked in and stood at the pulpit and asked how he could help. He opened it up to questions and made it a discussion format (which was how he taught us; SUPER cool). One brother stood up and told Elder Bednar that he had come across this anti-Mormon stuff that had shaken his testimony. Elder Bednar asked him how straight he would like his answer. The young man said he'd like it straight. Elder Bednar said "I've known about all of that stuff since I was 12 years old. Where have you been? Do you think the church has time to argue with all of that nonsense? Don't you think it has trust in its returned missionaries to study about it and find out for themselves that it's all bologna?"
He went on to say that the issue this man had was not the anti-Mormon material. It was lack of studying the Book of Mormon. He said to us "It's like we're in a dark room, and the Lord gives us a flashlight, we turn it off and complain when we start bumping into the walls!" Then he said something that really stuck with me, in connection with that analogy: "If sometime when you're home from your mission, you are really tired one night and you think to yourself 'oh, I'll just read tomorrow,' I hope my voice right now comes back and haunts you and says to you 'You idiot!'" (yes, he did say idiot) "'You're turning off the flashlight! DON'T turn off the flashlight!'"

I just love the fact that the Church is apparently putting so much trust in its returned missionaries. Jeremy Runnells, anyone? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Avoid statements such as "let me know if there's anything I can do to help" and instead rephrase them as direct questions like "what can I do today that would help you?" It's important to be there for them rather than just saying you will be and then blatantly prioritizing other things. Probably the most important thing, though, is to make sure they know that you're not disappointed in them for having to come home early and that it isn't their fault. It's really easy to feel inadequate and somehow worth less than other missionaries when your attempt to serve the Lord is ruined by something not under your control. Becoming an ERM is a very emotionally taxing and stressful experience--I did it less than a month ago, and even though coming home was exactly what I wanted, it was still hard, and I HATED my mission. Can't imagine how awful it feels for somebody much more invested than I was. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-03-14 10:09:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I live in a family of extremely devout Mormons. And so, of course, it was drilled into my head from a very young age that it was God's will for me to serve a mission, and if I didn't I was a bad Church member and loved myself more than God. I never truly wanted to go on a mission--the very concept was repulsive to me--but I always told my parents that I did so they would be proud of me. I guess I hoped that if I kept telling myself I wanted to go, it would one day be the truth. Unfortunately, that day never came.

After graduating high school in 2015,  I still wanted to live up to the Mormon Boy expectation that had been shoved down my throat my whole life, because what else was I going to do? And so despite having absolutely no idea whether or not the Church was true (I had read the Book of Mormon cover-to-cover three times, prayed every time, and felt absolutely nothing--everybody told me that I just needed to exercise more faith and the answer would eventually come), I wasted six months of my life trying to get my mission papers submitted and ultimately getting into the mission field. It took longer than I anticipated because I've had severe depression for a lot of years and the mission office initially rejected my submission, requesting that I receive counseling for said depression and that I could re-submit in a few months. Long story short, my counselor and medical doctor decided that the depression was not severe enough to warrant medication, and I was sent out into the field with nothing but prayer and "the Spirit" to keep me afloat. And since God apparently decided that the commandments are different if you're a missionary, all my coping mechanisms such as movies, video games, music, secular books, etc. were no longer available to me. I had nothing but the gospel. So, with my depression and lack of solid testimony in tow, I trudged out into the field and lasted no more than seven weeks--the hardest, longest, most painful seven weeks of my life.

The more time I spent being around the Church and really REALLY thinking about it, the more it began to fall apart in my mind. So much of it just didn't make sense or hold up to scrutiny. I could go into detail on all the inconsistencies and contradictions I found within the gospel, but I would be here for days just trying to remember all of them, and everyone here has already heard them or discovered them already. The most important thing is that I read the Book of Mormon for at least an hour every day, prayed every single time afterwards to receive the witness promised in Moroni 10, and I never felt a thing. So much for God loving all his children and desiring them to gain witness of the truth...

It wasn't too long before I realized that whether or not the gospel was true, I absolutely refused to devote myself to preaching it for two years. But despite my severely weakened testimony (not to mention my unbearable depression), going back home to good ol' Happy Valley Utah on purpose wasn't an option to me, because I knew it would bring shame worse than death and it would destroy everything I had ever lived for.

So I chose death.

Fortunately I chickened out at the last second and didn't go through with it, and even more fortunately, my attempted suicide was enough to get me an honorable medical release for depression. I've been home for about a month now and I cannot describe how relieved I am to be free of the hell of serving a mission, especially without the accompanying guilt and shame that I initially feared.

So ever since I got home, I've been spending my days doing whatever I want, and everybody's okay with it because they figure I'm just dealing with my depression and they see that I'm doing better. What they don't know is that I immediately stopped reading the scriptures and saying prayers when I got home. And I feel so much happier. It's also worth mentioning that my low point of every single week is attending church, which is pretty much the only gospel-related thing I still do. So now there's just way too much evidence that the gospel doesn't make me happy.

Two days ago I decided to lay this nightmare to rest and decide whether or not I'm staying in the Church. And I knew I wasn't getting any reasonable or reliable answers from Church material (Moroni's promise, anyone?) so I searched Google for "why I left the Mormon church" and found loads of accounts of people who had once loved the Church but left for various reasons. By the time I was done watching this video [ www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj9uLK-Z1MM ], I knew I was leaving too, and by the time I was done reading the CES Letter, I was absolutely furious. The sheer amount of lies hiding right under my nose for so many years is baffling to me and I'm almost more angry at myself than I am at the Church just because I didn't notice these things sooner in my life. Naturally, I didn't go to church or participate in family scripture study today, and my family has no idea why, but my dad is already mad at me and thinks I'm going inactive because of my depression. He doesn't know the half of it...

My decision to leave has become even more solidified by my experience tonight of having dinner with some very close family friends of mine. It just so happened that they had the missionaries over for dinner as well, and partway through the dinner conversation, I casually asked these missionaries how they dealt with situations in which people read the Book of Mormon, prayed continually and earnestly, but never received the spiritual witness promised by Moroni. "I've heard of this happening before," I said, "and I just wonder how you deal with that from a missionary perspective." (These guys had no idea that I was ever a missionary.)

The senior companion, who had been out for 23 months, said, "If they haven't gotten the spiritual witness, it means that they aren't keeping the commitments we give them."

"How do you know they aren't keeping commitments?" I asked him. "Do you ask them directly? Or do they admit it, maybe?"

His response was, "No, no. I can just tell."

"How can you tell?"

"Well... uh, because they haven't received the witness yet. That's how I know. Like, I can tell it's always something they're doing wrong, like with their faith or devotion or something."

Well, Mr. Shining Golden Example, I'm sorry that the seven weeks I spent on a mission for a Church I didn't know was true praying for a witness I never got and ultimately trying to end my life to avoid going home early wasn't enough "faith or devotion or something" for God.


So now I'm in a very rough situation. The Church isn't true, and I'm more sure of that after two days of research than I was about the Church being true after 19 years of doing what the Church says to do to find out. In a sense, I'm very excited, because I finally get to be free of this manipulative, brainwashing, fraudulent cult that I've been trapped in for almost one-quarter of my expected life. But at the same time, I'm more scared than I ever have been--not because I suddenly don't know if there's a God or a next life or who I am or what my purpose is, but actually because of a much more immediate threat: my family.

My family is not the type to literally disown me and kick me out because I choose to leave the Church. But they are the type to despise me for the choice and refuse to listen to anything I have to say. For the rest of my life they will see me as nothing but the evil, fallen child who is the cause of the empty chair in our reserved family circle in the Celestial Kingdom, and by the time I'm finally able to move out, I guarantee you that I will not come up in conversation without mention of my terrible apostasy. My uncle left the Church many years ago and my mom never talks about him unless she wants to gossip about his lack of faith. It's like she doesn't even consider him a brother anymore. It's disgusting and inhuman. I don't want to become that son.

Also, I've been planning my whole life to go to BYU, but now I refuse to because I would never be able to get married and I wouldn't be able to restrain myself from giving a copy of the CES Letter to everyone I see. I also just don't want to attend a university with Brigham Young's name plastered on it, or with the Church involved at all, for that matter. But how will I get the money to go somewhere else if my dad withdraws financial support as a result of my decision? And up until I somehow manage to move out and I've found somewhere else to go to college (which, considering admission deadlines and whatnot, will probably take a long time) and I'm still living at home, how do I deal with my family who will treat me like a lost sheep and see me as absolutely nothing else for every second of every day? I have to leave the Church, that much is certain, but I just have no idea how I'm going to deal with it. It's making my head hurt and honestly the suicidal thoughts are coming back as I realize what my life will be like after this comes out. I guess my chances of going through with it are pretty low this time, though, considering that I probably don't have an afterlife to look forward to anymore.

TL;DR - I'm leaving the Church but I have no idea how to deal with the repercussions that will come as a result of it in regards to my family, my education, and basically just my entire life situation.

How do I tell my parents and siblings? What's the ideal setting and how much should I explain about what I've learned? Should I invite them to read the CES Letter so they might see what I now see? Where's a good place for an ex-Mormon to go to college in Utah? How can I possibly afford it without the help of my parents? How do I stay strong when I've already had suicidal tendencies and now my entire life has crumbled to bits and it will be pretty much destroyed completely once my parents find out about this decision?

Any advice you guys can give me is absolutely needed and appreciated. This is probably the second-most difficult situation I've ever been in (second only to the hellhole that was my mission) and I'm in severe need of help.

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: Wow, I seriously cannot put into words how grateful I am for all the support I've received on this thread in just 24 hours. I expected some good responses but this exceeded my hopes and expectations. Thank you all for your amazing advice and sincere love. (More sincere love than I ever felt from the Church, that's for sure.)

I haven't told my parents yet, and I'm still trying to decide whether to do a slow fade like most of you have suggested or to just tell them straight up, along with the decision of moving out or not before doing the latter. There certainly seem to be pros and cons to all scenarios, so I will give it some time and careful consideration. Thank you all for your experiences and suggestions on this. I'm leaning toward giving them a slightly edited copy of this post so they can see my true feelings and my hesitations in being a disappointment to them. But, like I said, I'll give it time and thought before doing anything like that.

I'm feeling a lot more confident now in regards to my future, and I can see now that I have a great support system under me. The people on this sub are marvelous, I have a few VERY close friends who left or are in the process of leaving the Church, and I now suddenly realize that BYU isn't the only college in the state. USU is looking pretty appealing--the closest friend I had in my ward growing up is currently attending there and left the Church several months ago. Immediate connection. I also have relatives up there who I could fall back on if things get rough, or even if I don't want to pay for housing. The downside is that they're LDS. Oh well, things to consider.

I'll continue taking all of these comments into thoughtful consideration, and I'll continue coming to the realization that my life doesn't have to suck right now. I can't thank you all enough. </TEXT>
