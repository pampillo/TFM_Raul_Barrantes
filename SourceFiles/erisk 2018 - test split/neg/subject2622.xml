<TEXT> I've seen it. I've lived it. Maybe I have a somewhat unique perspective on it, but I feel like bringing down pedophiles would always be a good day. Especially on this scale.
You do wish it didn't exist. But it does. I sometimes feel bad for the people that don't realize how big this problem is. Not to mention the idea that these aren't just solo actors, they have communities and support systems to help them commit atrocities! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just because It's spot on doesn't mean I have to agree with it. The fact that it was posted under /r/funny and not /r/sexism or another more serious subreddit, should be a huge clue that it was satirical. I've only ever heard this analogy used as a joke. Unlike most people, I don't take myself too seriously. I find humor in everything because white males are the most difficult people in the world to offend.

Since we're getting serious though... Stereotypes are in place for a reason. As outdated as those reasons may be, they still existed.  Males are supposed to try to fuck anything that moves. Females, however, are supposed to have strong filtering mechanisms to weed out the unfit males. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely not! 
It's a spot on reference to society's view as a whole.
I lost my virginity at 21 to a girl that had no interest in being with me, she just wanted to take it. I made the decision to do it thinking it would be more, it wasn't.  I've been in a relationship with both the girls I've had sex with since then and am currently engaged to the last one.  I've never had the desire to just fuck as much as I can, and I've never held peoples past against them... Turns out I should have with the first one. 

You don't know me and I don't know you, but I'm only now making the assertion that you're a condescending fuck. Whereas you judged me for making a relevant, accurate, yet satirical statement on a post labeled "funny".

Cheers </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you have a key that opens many locks, it is a master key.

If you have a lock that is opened by many keys, well, that's just a shitty lock.

*EDIT* Really? No only is this funny, it perfectly encompasses how society views promiscuity among males (who are applauded for their conquests) and females (who become viewed as easy or less desirable).  If you feel the need to downvote this, you've got some issues to overcome. There was zero judgment in my comment, just a statement relevant to the original post. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, actually this sub is for pictures. My picture qualifies. A lot more than most if not all engagement rings. So if you don't like it, why did you click it? You could easily have scrolled past to the next picture. 

You know what? I actually feel bad for you. Did you turn to drugs and alcohol after a failed marriage? or did your marriage fail because of them?
Either way, take a good look in the mirror. Re-evaluate yourself, because you're kind of a douche.  Best of luck to you finding your own happiness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its a picture. Where the fuck else am I supposed to put it? Every subreddit has rules. Some subs tell you to go elsewhere and they point you to a sub that points you back to the one that sent you there in the first place. EVERY picture is uninteresting if you dont know what the hell the is going on in it. Is it too much to ask that you just take it for what it is? Im not asking you to be happy or congratulate me, just realize that the ring in that picture is more than just that. It's something you dont see every day that you will see less and less of as time goes on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is not my story.

I received so many likes on my own page after sharing my kittens little story that I decided to share it on here as well. 

When we got my little kitten Kimba, her eyes were barely open. She was probably only about two weeks old; with an extremely low chance of survival. Josh and I tried everything we could to keep her healthy in her extremely young age. He would spend hours helping me feed her milk and egg protein through a syringe. When she got a little less wobbly on the legs he spent time playing with her and when she was tuckered out from that or it was one of those blistering cold Pennsylvania winter nights he would cuddle up on the floor with her until she felt comfortable enough to sleep. When she got a little bit older we had to start taking her to the vet; something that was defiantly not on Kimbas list of favorites. Josh would always drive me there with her when he could. Shed be terrified but after a while would come out of her crate and go straight to his lap, hed always tease me that he must have smelled better than I did to her. 

I could tell she really had taken a liking to him, his shoes automatically become her favorite thing to stick her head in when he came over and I noticed she would only sleep in my bed if Josh was there too. Kimba never EVER slept in my bed when she got older unless he was there, and hasnt since the last time Josh slept over last Christmas. I remember we were watching Rudolph together and Kimba had jumped right up beside him purring like a motor and fell straight to sleep. I had accepted that she wasnt going to sleep with me no matter how many times I put her in my bed at night. Only Joshs naps before Track practice could seem to get her to do that. Tragically, as you know Josh was killed earlier this year in an active duty training mission just a few months prior to his first deployment to Afghanistan. When the Marine Corp sent Joshs belongings back we decided to have teddy bears made from his uniform. I had brought mine home and laid it on my bed: not expecting what I would stumble upon next. When I came back up to my room I was surprised to see Kimba sleeping IN MY BED and how loudly she was purring. And then I noticed she had her paw over the arm of the bear we had made to remember Josh. Even though his uniforms had been washed by the military she must have still been able to pick up his scent. I still couldnt believe it because it was completely out of character for her. This definatly made the tears fall because I realized she can still feel like shes sleeping with him even though hes been gone for six months. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well... I'm sort of an awkward fellow to begin with, so when I arrived at the park and didn't see them I decided to sit in my vehicle (to not look like a creepy 20-something scoping kids in the park). I kept looking around because I wasn't sure when they were going to show up because she was about ten minutes late and I hadn't heard from her. There were two women sitting under a pavilion watching their kids play and talking. After a while of sitting there, I noticed they were watching me. So automatically, I got nervous. Then I noticed one of them motioning toward me. The other one decided to take a quick stroll down to their vehicle and made the return trip past the back of mine, eyeing my license plate the whole way... She got back up to the other lady and they talked a little bit and stared at me some more. Then just as she was pulling her phone out, my gf pulled in and I jumped out to greet them. The ladies gave another look and put her phone away. 

It could be that I'm just paranoid, but I think there were too many coincidences and too much staring on their part to say that they just wanted to come say hi. My dark clothes and tattoos probably didnt help. </TEXT>

You're probably overweight and/or not very attractive (I know this because you're describing me).  Also, your friend is right. You have to build a foundation before you bust out the relationship stuff.  You need to stop giving them everything. Let them know your after them WITHOUT gifts and sweet gestures. Use your words. Once they know you're into them as more than a friend, you can start the romantic crap. as long as they're obviously on board.

As much as I hate to say this, you kind of have to be a dick.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> When making a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich, Which do you spread first? (story inside) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-10 13:36:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last week I was making a PB J sandwich and I noticed some jelly in the peanut butter. I was like "How the fuck does that happen? You always spread peanut butter first..."  So I showed my brother and he said "You spread peanut butter first? That's weird." Discussion ensued.

I base my spreading habits on two ideas. First, it's easier to prevent peanut butter from transferring to the jelly. Second, even if you happen to get peanut butter in the jelly, it doesn't matter because Jelly is supposed to be refrigerated. Whereas if you get jelly in the peanut butter, that jelly will no longer be refrigerated for as long as it remains in the peanut butter. 

Thoughts?  </TEXT>

Due to his body's natural pain killers... and perhaps some prescription ones... He hit on every nurse that walked by. He got a few giggles with his crazy lines but was inevitably shut down by all of them. I remember his favorite opener was a stuffy nosed "Hellooo ladies!" with dual finger guns.  </TEXT>

If we weren't delivering it, most of it would still find a way to come as printed material. Whether it comes as an insert in the newspaper or an ad/offer thrown in with items you ordered online, they will always find a way. As for waste, my area has recently implemented some recycling bins in the lobbies so that P.O. box customers can recycle it on the spot and I would hope a fair portion of delivery customers are recycling what they can. I would hardly say we "contribute" to the waste.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you have some credit established already? If so, go ahead and pay cash. If you could use the positive credit history, borrow a bit. The plus side of that is that you'll still have savings and you always have the option of an early payoff.

In my experience no one cares about how much money you have. It's all about your proven ability to acquire and pay back debt. No one will lend you money until you prove you can pay it back but you can't prove you can pay it back unless someone will lend it to you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The article on snopes is irrelevant in this situation. 
Because, It only covers the idea that the sugar will turn into liquid cement not the effects of unfiltered sugar gas on an engine and/or carburetor..

This was the 70's, which means that the technology wasn't as sophisticated and the vehicle was carbureted. Less sophisticated filtration coupled with the fragile nature of carburetors when met with even small pieces of dirt would cause a pretty fucked up car.  Not knowing the cause would also lead to someone saying "My car is ruined."

Once you assure her that you're not out for anything in order to make her comfortable enough to go to the dance with you, it becomes impossible to escalate the relationship to romance because you've made it clear (to her) that you don't want anything from her. Thus landing yourself in the much debated "friend zone"...

<TEXT> It makes sense as an excuse. If you want to go out with your friends, but at the same time you don't, you'll have your chores as an excuse. Perhaps you don't want to have that as an excuse. Because honestly, those are really minor things that shouldn't keep you from going out, especially if you  typically only go out on weekends.

I understand the cons of going out on your own. It tends to suck, but things can't change unless you put yourself out there.  If you do decide to go out on your own, don't be afraid to post your plans to facebook or text some of your friends letting people know that they're welcome to join you but your plans aren't dependent on them. Make sure you follow through with it whether or not you'll be alone though. Don't ask them to join you. Tell them they're welcome to come along.

Dude, forget your ex.  Unless she's dead, she's having a ton of fun without you. If she died, I'd say that's your problem right there in which case you need to accept that she'd want you to be having fun.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nothing about anything I said was "thoughtless".  

Anyone that wants to spend their time worrying is more than welcome to.  If you live is South Korea or Japan, then you probably should worry.  But I'm not going to worry about something that won't do me any harm. What am I going to do about South Korea and Japan? I could contact my congressmen to let them know I feel like we the US should protect them, but that'll only get you so far (nowhere to be exact).  And they're probably going to do that anyway.

I just want all the people that are giving me a hard time to understand that I'm not a fearful person. I haven't been for a long time. If you stare down death long enough, you realize that there are times that you can't win, so it's best to let your mind rest. You can drive yourself mad with fear and worry over things beyond your control. </TEXT>

2. I have felt 0 economic repercussions from the Iraq "war".  I make money, I spend money, the world keeps spinnin'.

If you're going to mention the fact that I told you to shut the fuck up, then you should also mention the fact that I am deeply sorry if you have lost any family to war. You can't pick and choose like that. </TEXT>

I am a 23 year old firefighter.  I've helped more people in the last year than some lazy asshole like you will help in your lifetime.  I've SEEN death. I've listened as people begged for their lives. I've heard screams fade to silence. Maybe that's what you need to learn what "affect" really means.

<TEXT> 1. The war is funded with taxes that you pay anyway. 

2. National debt is just something that is there, we are seldom in the black. It only affects you when they raise taxes, and only if they raise taxes that apply to you.

3. How about those people? Were you one of them? Were any of them family members? If you answered "yes" to the last two questions, then I am deeply sorry and the war HAS affected you. If you answered "no" to the last two questions, then sit down and shut the fuck up.

<TEXT> The ways you're "affected" aren't personal! They're choices you make.  You could cut all ties to it if you wanted, but the truth is you'd rather act/feel like it affects you so you have something to complain about and something to connect yourself to for attention.

Tell me. You live your life differently because of soldiers dying overseas? I don't think you do. You live your life differently because your neighbor lost a family member? Nope. You mourn and go right back to your everyday life. 

I'm a firefighter. 343 firefighters died on 9-11. That sucks. But I still live the same way I did when they were alive. I haven't lost anything.  I feel for those that lost family, but I haven't been personally affected by it.  Just because you're surrounded by something doesn't mean you're affected by it.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's crazy. I assumed you meant more of a weight loss thing.

Scarring is a tricky thing. Like you said before, it can vary wildly.  Your skin type, different ointments used during healing and after, and stress put on the scar causing it to stretch and be more pronounced. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What you're describing is a deeper concept than free will. By definition, free will is simply "the power of acting without the constraint of necessity or fate; the ability to act at one's own discretion"

Free will has nothing to do with what you know or what is scientifically possible in the world. My examples of overeating or suicide are perfect in that I wasn't doing them out of hunger or depression. I was just doing it for the hell of it.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You do have control over your thoughts thoughts though.  Right now I'm on Reddit. I think I'll go catch a plane to Nebraska. That was pretty fucking random. I literally have no connection to Nebraska nor has it been mentioned at any point recently. I pulled it out of my.

Even if your thoughts do control your actions, how is that not free will?

You are your brain. Free will would be any idea that happens in your head that aren't orders from someone else.  It's impossible to do anything completely without thought, conscious or subconscious. 

The only way I would accept that free will doesn't exist is with proof that everything is predestined.  </TEXT>

There is  usually at least one reason that we do things, but the fact that we make a choices IS free will.  Or the fact that we would make a decision to take the long way home. Why would our brain send us the longer route? Wouldn't it want to be as efficient as possible? If free will didn't exist, wouldn't we make the same decisions over and over again?  There would be more consistency to our lives.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Things are worse but people are also candy-asses. They have this "zero-tolerance" policy now that if you're caught fighting, both parties get in trouble. You're not allowed to whoop the bully's ass for him anymore because you need to be the "stronger" person and tell a teacher instead, so they can in turn say "Well, there isn't really anything I can do bout it unless I see it, so why don't you just try to steer clear of him from now on?" 

Society created this problem by punishing victims. Much like the gun debate, bullies aren't going to stop bullying because it's all of a sudden "illegal (so to speak) yet you've effectively stopped victims from defending themselves. Now the victims think they're protected when they actually aren't but they also know that they can't put an end to it through violence or they're going down for it too even though they were only defending themselves.

It's designed so you slip it halfway under something so that someone thinks they've found five dollars.

I used to get in trouble all the time for porn that my dad had watched but he wouldn't man up and admit. I didn't figure this out until I was old/savvy enough to remember what I watched and delete my own browser history.   

My parents have always been ok about everything. Even when they found out I smoked weed and when they found out I drank underage.  I've always talked it out with them.

No matter what approach you take, the end result is the same. You HAVE to talk about it.  Just make sure he knows that you're not going to hold it against him or respect him any less.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, they've discussed many ways that people are stigmatized by criminal charges whether they turn out to be guilty or innocent. You're blind if you can't see that. They release people EVERY FUCKING DAY that have been wrongly incarcerated. People get arrested and detained and treated like criminals because of police "instinct" or false information.  Evidence is fabricated to get the conviction. "proven" guilty is always an opinion. Whether it's BASED in fact of not.

**EDIT:** Wow. Somebody can use google...  See, I'm not an asshole so I thought it would be ok to put a picture of my car (that I also have on facebook) in this comment. Apparently someone knows ho to image search and I don't keep my facebook private because, again, I'm not an asshole. So they took my phone number and they've been using a prank dial system to call me.  At least do your own dirty work, you fucking pussy.  </TEXT>

My little brother got bit in the face by a dog when he was like 13. We didnt want the guy to turn it in but he did it anyway. His homeowner's insurance put a letter in the mail the very next day offering 28,000 over 3 installments (18, 21, and 25 years old)  because if they didn't put the matter to rest, he could have sued them once he turned 18 or if any vision problems ever occurred with the eye that was damaged.

<TEXT> I agree. It's a weird concept but in my opinion, gay marriage is a much simpler "issue" than racial, cultural, foreign, or economic problems. Gay marriage isn't even in the same league as those other issues therefore it's easier to have an opinion on and discuss. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This logic could also be used to argue in favor of gay marriage for the simple fact that the government shouldn't be involved in evolutionary matters. If homosexuality is a genetic mutation, it is destroying itself by not necessarily reproducing every time it's present. Whereas before when homosexuality was kept quiet, a lot more of them reproduced out of fear of being discovered. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sounds like you're doing it right.  Having your life in order is a huge plus. Be supportive but not overly in your face supportive.

The girl I've been seeing told me up front that she wants to know she'll be ok on her own before jumping into anything.  Her boyfriend just threw her and her 2 y/o out a few months ago leaving her with nothing.  She never wants to be in the position of having nothing ever again. I respect that.  As for the kid, he's awesome. He likes me (which is weird because kids usually hate me), which I KNOW has been a huge help.  She usually tries to hang out while he's with his dad so we have more time to talk but I've also joined them at the park a few times and made sure she knew he was welcome any time we've had plans or suggested staying in if she didn't want to take him out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My cousin and I were on a roller coaster at Fantasy Island when I was 16 and he was 14.  He was joking back and forth with the operator because this was the 3+ time we rode the coaster that day.  The operator forgot to check our bar which I had noticed right as we were taking off but didn't think anything of it.  We got to the highest drop and my cousin said "Put your hands up in the air! It's so much more fun!"  So I began to put my hands up, and all in slow motion...

 The bar came up. I saw him lift out of the seat. I threw my right arm across his legs and wedged my legs against the front of the cart. I pushed him back down into the seat with my right arm and pulled the bar down with my left. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lost it about a year ago at the age of 22.  We were both bored and apparently she found out that I'd had a crush on her in school so she started chatting me up and eventually invited me over specifically for sex.  We fucked for a little over an hour. I give total credit to the fact that I've jerked it 1-3 times a day since I was a teenager.  She was very experienced... for lack of a better word.  She called me every weekend for a few months trying to get me to visit her at college, even after she got a boyfriend.  We stopped talking after I kept turning her down because I didn't want to drive a 3 hour round trip for sex. </TEXT>

Same thing (sort of) happened to me.  Except I wasn't drinking, I was just babysitting her stupid ass.  But she kept taking her clothes off and trying to go outside because she needed more crackers or a drink. I went and got them for her. She ended up getting sick, I rubbed her back and talked to her...

Cut to the morning

We had both fallen asleep inside the camper we were staying in. She woke up before me and was outside telling everyone I was trying to have sex with her. I was PISSED.  I can't even imagine what kind of shitstorm would have come if I had been drunk too.

**EDIT:** She has since proven that she's bat shit crazy </TEXT>

1. She doesn't get any benefits to begin with.

2. The Postal Service in in decline because of a law passed in 2006 that started making them pre-pay benefits for FUTURE employees. The Postal Service has given the government so much money that as of right now they're paying future benefits for Employees that haven't even been born yet. 

3. When a business needs to "trim the fat" They should start with corporate waste!

<TITLE> What is your worst Valentines Day experience? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-02-14 02:23:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I was in high school, this girl move up to PA from Georgia.  She had this sweet sweet southern accent and the prettiest eyes you've ever seen.

We went to school together but she was a year behind me so I never really had the chance to talk to her... Well my senior year I was like "Fuck it. It's now or never."  So valentines day rolls around and she's kinda down because she doesn't have a valentine. It's my time to shine, I thought...
So I had some flowers delivered to the school for her with a card asking her to hang out is she was free after school. Well, she thought they were from the guy she liked. Now, I'm not the best looking guy, but what happened next blew my mind...

My sister meets me at my car after school and says "Dude... Did you send ____ flowers?"  I of course smiled and said "Yeah, what did she say!?"  To which my sister replied...

"Well... She's running around school telling everyone you're stalking her. She is having a couple guys walk her to her bus so you don't try anything."

Pretty much destroyed Valentines Day forever.



**TL;DR** I sent a girl flowers and she told everyone I was stalking her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The artist is my cousin. He didn't really want to do steampunk because he isn't familiar with the concept.  But I was like "Nah, you got this!"  

It's not leather, it's supposed to be a reddish bronze, but it came out a little dark. I'm hoping it'll lighten up once it peels. I just got it done Saturday.  I'm glad I finally got some feedback rather than just downvotes. Thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay. Why don't you go find him and politely ask him to come to the station with you? Let us know what happens. 

Obviously he's not slaughtering people, but who knows how many people recognized him and are dead now but the bodies are hidden. Maybe none, maybe 20. It's impossible to know. But we do know that he is suspected of murder, he HAS opened fire on people, and he doesn't want to go easily. Is that enough of a reason? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why don't you tell me about this "technology" that causes automatics to get better gas mileage?  It may not be immediately significant but manuals DO get slightly better gas mileage.  Have do ever noticed how "experts" assure you that automatics are just as good yet they fail multiple times more often than manuals?  How about the fact that if you're buying a new car it costs you $1000+ to have the auto installed instead?  Also, you CAN downshift an automatic... That is, if you want to destroy it faster. Any questions? </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you don't know how to drive a standard/manual, fucking learn. You get better gas mileage and you have better control.

Do research before you buy because cars have VERY different maintenance costs.  Learn about your car. Follow maintenance guidelines. They're recommended for a reason.

My older brother bought our neighbors house fairly cheap because of some personal stuff and the lady needed out so she put in a good word with the bank and she only wanted what she absolutely needed... And come on, free food next door 24/7?  I've gone grocery shopping maybe three times since I moved. (I usually just have my mom pick me up some when she goes because I work crazy hours). But she also says thing like "Oh, we already have some of that."   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't believe I forgot about this... 

There is a sort of gated community near my house. Anyone can get in, you just gotta say "Hey, I'm taking my friend home" or something at the guard house. Even just keep your car rolling slowly and wave and they won't stop you. 

Anyway. My cousin and his buddy were In there one night cruising around and drinking after a long day of moving him into his new place. They still had some stuff in the back seat including a 32 inch tv from his bedroom. This is a BIG place and it's built in a forest. People get lost in there all the time. He managed to find the camp ground and knew that if he stayed there he'd be able to find his way out in the morning. A while later, security rolls up. Apparently there had been a few break ins and thefts at the campground. The security guard sees the tv in his backseat and calls the real cops before he even gets out of his car.  He walks over to my cousin and asks what they're doing and of course, he just says they're cruising around. The guard smells alcohol and asks if he can have a look in the car my cousin says "No" because of the alcohol, not knowing the guard is looking at the tv.  after that I'm not sure what happened but he ended up only getting a drunk in public out of the stop.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What makes you qualified to make you analysis of deadly car accidents?

I'm not sure what it is. It's not technically a thing I don't think... but here is the gist of it. 

If you stood the two of us on a street corner with our eyes closed then we opened our eyes for five seconds,  I'd be able to tell you a shitload of what's happening on the street. whereas others might just have time to process what is happening directly in front of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How difficult was finding a job in law enforcement? 

Aside from my dad's business, that's the only thing I've ever wanted to do. Now that the postal service is kind of sinking and I've been looking into it more, I've found that it's hard to get a job around here because the state is looking to hire women and minorities. But what they don't understand is that we just don't have anything but white people around here and not many women are interested. And the small towns won't hire any full time officers because they don't want to pay benefits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They never got any type of "official" speed.   I'm also a firefighter and an all around good guy.  I've never been fined for speeding either and I've been pulled over 3 or 4 times in my 7 year driving career. Once was because some new local guy thought I stole my own car though.  I think every time I get caught speeding they check to see if I've been fined before but when they see that I haven't they assume that I'm not constantly speeding... If that makes any sense. </TEXT>
