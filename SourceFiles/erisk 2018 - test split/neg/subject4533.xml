<TITLE> Brushing your teeth. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 14:24:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have not seen a movie where the actor has visible toothpaste or foam in their mouth. How bloody hard is it for someone to make some sort of replica prop? Oh the scene says you have to be brushing your teeth while delivering your lines? Why be brushing your teeth in the first place if thats the case? If the point is that you're in your daily morning routine, do something else that is relatable. Deliver your lines while eating your breakfast or some shit. Its so annoying when the actor is just sliding a perfectly plain toothbrush in their mouth like its a normal thing. Then they go their stupid sink and spit out nothing its like cmon dude what the hell man. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Glad you enjoyed it for the most part. 

The film started off incredibly well. The title scene left me absolutely gob smacked. Hands down best part of the movie right there. It was immersive, up until they all hop off the ship. If you disliked Prometheus, Covenant is goddamn deja vu. So. Many. Stupid. Decisions. Its too much. I understand where youre coming from but to me it was an absolute mess. 

Kinda spoiler: This movie features the most hilariously bizarre scene of the year. The whole theater was cracking up. It was ridiculous.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> comes down to the person watching i guess. i have never really found a horror/thriller comedy that has tickled my fancy because i dont like the middle ground that it sits between. 

for get out, i dont think it was culture specific, as in american to australian kind of thing. it sort of laid itself on the surface of basic black person reacts to crazy white people shenanigans.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So Get Out only just came out in Australia yesterday. Overall i enjoyed the movie. The pacing was nice and i liked that every scene fit together like a puzzle as the movie drew to a conclusion. 

For me the humour fell very flat. The jokes were very much for the younger kids i felt. Most of them were cracking up when the TSA scenes played out. On a side note why do characters feel the need to describe what they are doing to the audience. Stuff like that makes me feel like im being spoon fed. Minor complaint is when Chris kills the brother - how did he not hear him get up? 

 Probably the best part of the movie was when the guests all stopped when Chris walked upstairs. That gave me chills right there. 

It was pretty fun when I think back on it. It wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Watched Prometheus for the first time on blu-ray. Overall the movie was a bit dull. Here are some notes I wrote down throughout the movie that I hope will get some discussion going! 

- The intro credit scene was awesome. Amazing landscape shots. Laughed a bit when that guy (engineer) took off his hoodie - he looked like a life size action figure or something.
- The first scene in Scotland felt unnecessary. It was an iffy introduction to the two main crew members.
- The first few scenes introducing David were mesmerizing. The movie could have easily started with these scenes.
- Charlize Theron played her character terribly. She had the "i am 100% not trust worthy" look on her face the whole time.
- The two main characters (Shaw and Holloway) had terrible chemistry when acting together. The scene where he mentions life and birth in general (talking about what they were discovering) and she literally just gets sad to make it obvious that she can't have kids. That whole scene was very soppy.
- Their whole venture is based off of a bunch of cave drawings found around the world. How did they pinpoint the exact planet they were travelling to out of a bunch of cave paintings?
- They are only briefed of their mission AFTER their two year hibernation. 
- Holloway had the most random death in the entire film. Within minutes he gets this "disease" and hes literally just like "MEREDITH KILL ME" with his arms open wide. Meredith kills him without an instant even though the ship is equipped with a more than capable medical bay. 
- The ship lands exactly where the huge shrine rock thing was. Did they have coordinates as to where this was? Did the cave paintings ever show this huge rock thing? The chances of finding that as soon as they pass through the clouds must be pretty low (unless theres more than one, which i dont think is ever mentioned). 
- The entire crew just wander into the rock thing. Why didn't they take their time? It seemed as if they just aimlessly strolled in and found the shit they were looking for. 
- Two of the crew members get lost even though minutes ago they plotted out an expansive detailed map showing every nook and cranny of the place. The captain is then just like "aight boys yall gonna have to stay the night there its stormy as shit". Why didn't he tell them where to go? The 4d map he was looking at had tracers on each members - he could have easily directed them out of the cave complex. 
- David completely fucked over Holloway for no reason by spiking his drink. Also, he spikes it RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM. As in, I am passing you a drink, you're looking at the drink, and I dip my finger tip that has black gooey shit on it into it as you're looking at the drink. The fuck?
- The main guy somehow is smoking weed in his fucking space suit while on a planet that has never been inhabited by anyone on Earth. And he gets stoned and wanders around. 
- They extract DNA from an engineers head and it matches with human DNA - complete with computer screens that literally pair the two together and spit out the words "DNA MATCH".
- Theres these strange hologram recordings that show the engineers running around the place. Is this technology built in to the cave complex? Do these holograms just play randomly? Or were they triggered by the crew people strolling in? To me it seemed like a cop out idea to keep the plot moving forward quickly.
- The movie itself looked incredible. My favorite parts were the huge panning landscape shots throughout.

Hopefully Alien: Covenant doesn't follow the same structure as this or has the same errors. That would be a real shame. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have no knowledge about linguistics but one thing that slightly bugged was was how they gathered enough information from the aliens that allowed them to interpret their language. Names seemed to be the most straightforward area, but how in the fuck did they determine that this small circle is the word "culture" or this lil circle right here means "war"? What were they basing this research on? Its been a while since ive seen it so my memory of the specifics is a bit hazy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My bluray copy arrived this morning. This is definitely not for the faint of heart. I can confidently say that it takes a lot to crack me in terms of gore and a disturbing nature. This movie absolutely obliterated me. I was squirming. You know that feeling you get that can only be described as complete hopelessness? Its like that but very subtle and it lingers. 

The general consensus is quite divided, but I can easily recommend this film to any horror fan who enjoys putting themselves through such bleak situations. My only criticism is the ending as I feel like it ended too abruptly. Apart from that, 9/10.  </TEXT>

She was supposed to be the goddess of the ocean, yet, she only uses it to push the big guy off the boat. When she gets back, her parents have no issue about where the fuck she was. It was known that her father was very strict about her leaving the island, yet when she arrives back he is 100% all smiles. 

Overall i found it to be enjoyable but these small errors irritated me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jesus fucking christ where do I even begin? What is going on over there at HQ? Have they employed babies to work on their iOS app? 


1. The app itself takes a lifetime to load up. 90% of the time the loading bar gets stuck (my internet coverage is fine) and I have to restart the app after which the loading breezes through.

2. The repetition glitch. This happens to me all the fucking time. Youre scrolling through anything; your feed, someones tracks, someones liked tracks. You realize that all youre seeing is the first ten or so songs repeating itself into infinity! Sometimes this never ends, and sometimes it loads the next ten tracks and then decides to repeat those. This has to be the worst out of all the bugs. I cant even explain how annoying this in practically any situation. 

3. No love for artists/people who USE THE BASIC FUNCTIONS. Wheres the inbox/messaging features like in the old app? NOPE. You gotta have a whole different app for that! Want to see who's following you? Well, you can't. Want to see your notifications? Well, that is no where to be found. Want to see basic statistics on your tracks? Nope! Want to edit your spotlight? Nope!!!

4. Sometimes when you initially go to scroll through the waveform of a track, it will shoot you to a position that is always somewhere towards the end. A small, but highly frustrating bug. 

Surely others are experiencing these bugs and more. The worst part is that the app is frequently updated but none of these seem to be fixed/addressed after each update. Their dominant focus seems to be revolved around their new subscription service. Im all for Soundcloud's strategies to increase profits, but please PLEASE fix the iOS app if you want me to stick around. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was a bit on the fence about this movie after walking out of the cinema. I have a few areas I'd like to bring up. Overall I thought it was a very well done film. NOTE: SPOILERS AHEAD!


No jump scares - This was something that surprised me definitely. Not only is there no jump scares, there is strong tension up until the ending. 

The therapist - I think some scenes with the therapist were a bit drawn out. Im not too sure if I accept her involvement in the movie just yet. Would have been great if the film let the audience figure out all the little details about Kevin, instead of a few long scenes with the therapist where she vomits out everything she knows about him. I think her main role was to give the audience information about him and Im not too sure if i liked that. 

The "beast" reveal - I am happy that Kevin didnt go all out and transform into a crazy werewolf beast. In saying that, there was so much build up to this beast that I am guessing some people would have been disappointed with how he looked. 

The beast through the bars - Wow. My favourite part of the film. Kevin slowly bending the bars to get his face in. That close up shot of him should be ICONIC. And him screaming all those demonic/preachy things, CREEPY. 

Supporting actresses - They played the parts great. I was just disappointed that they didnt make it to the very end. Their deaths seemed too sudden and Im not too sure if the beasts cannibalism was explained too much throughout, as I was quite confused when it was revealed that he had eaten them.   

Ending twist/reveal - I have no opinion on this as I have not seen Unbreakable. This ultimately did not effect the movie for me!

All in all, very fun and interesting movie jacked with tension.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did not enjoy this movie at all. Its pretty much the polar opposite of the original film in terms of immersion, tension and believability. The characters are stock standard and you can pretty much guess the order they are going to die in from the get go. I really wish this movie wasnt made because in my opinion in changes how you perceive the original film. Part of the reason why the first film is so effective is that it feels authentic, and this "sequel" distorts that authenticity.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is a movie typically edited starting from the beginning and ending with the credits? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-01 15:11:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I find the whole process of editing both interesting and strenuous. Sometimes when I watch movies I imagine myself in the editing room, paying attention to the people with their eyes on the screens getting every little detail perfect. 

I am interested in understanding how a movie is edited from start to finish. How many people are involved? What rules/processes are taken into consideration in order to make sure the whole movie flows right? Does the art of editing a movie change much from an independent movie to a full scale hollywood blockbuster? Do editors have full control over the placement of the score and the audio in general? How many people contribute in total? 

I hope these questions stimulate some interesting discussions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Which is why platforms like Soundcloud are so great. Go to your favourite artists profiles and scout through their likes and who they are following. Regardless of followers, there are some really talented individuals on Soundcloud. Instead of waiting for music to be delivered to you through big Youtube channels, do some digging on your own!

<TEXT> basically shlohmo puts some of the elements of his songs in the left and right channels, in most cases his vocals. if you get rid of the mono channel and combine the left and right, youre left with just whatever is in the stereo space. i did this for his entire discography and discovered some neat little stems. 

asleep on the 22 (acapella)

beams (bells)

get out (acapella)

just us (acapella)

meet ur maker (brass)

wen uuu (drums)

wen uuu (ending acapella)

there are very small artifacts in a few of them. but most of them sound great. thought it would be cool to share with fellow producers and enthusiasts.

The second bug I encounter is similar to the first one except you can hear the ball bounce off but the ball itself remains still. If you drive slower into it, the collision noise gets looped and goes nuts. 

Both of these are solvable by simply restarting but i thought i should share them.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The reveal and walk up to the house was done really well. The main things that bugged me were: 


- characters were not developed enough (what a surprise!) 
- too many edits that made it feel like a traditional movie instead of found footage. 
- uneventful jump scares 
- random stuff that contributed nothing to the movie. ie the infected foot thing and the whole "the footage was theirs" twist thing. 
- "look at the witch and you die" 


This could be just me but it also makes the original feel a lot less authentic.  </TEXT>

Ummmmm what? Are you saying that people shouldnt complain about a movie that was cheaply made? Are you saying people shouldnt complain about a movie that was filled with stock standard tropes and made for the masses? 

When you trade subtlety and realism for +4000dB screams and "0-100" moments, people are gonna be pissed. You enjoyed Blair Witch, good for you. Some people didn't. Who cares?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me personally I was a little bit dejected walking out of the theater after seeing this film. I am still currently organizing my thoughts but ultimately this film is just completely unnecessary. I stand by the statement that The Blair Witch Project is a film that should not be messed with nor expanded upon. Sure, its normal for viewers to want things to be explained (TBWP has handfuls of unanswered questions), but I think that is what makes it so special. The brief explanations of the mythology given in the original film are both effective and disturbing enough. We don't need a stylized reboot that fucks around with the mythology. 

The best part is that I was not affected by this film whatsoever and I am sure many others will agree with me. The film was not scary. A loud sound is not scary. Waiting for the next loud sound is not scary. Seeing the witch was not scary. Shaky camera is not scary. 

The most effective part about The Blair Witch Project is its authenticity. The way it was shot, the realness of the characters and the locals, the subtle hints of lore that pointed towards something truly evil. Its just something that cannot be effective in this day and age of horror films, found footage films to be more specific.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its definitely quite hard to see but the witch basically mashed the baby up (with a rock or something) and smeared it all over her body under the moon. 

Theres an old old story that doing so would give a witch the ability to fly (the shot of the moon). Id love to source where i read that but it was a while ago.  </TEXT>

The "malware detected" box keeps popping up when these programs are running but when I open them, Windows Defender finds nothing. 

When I open the file location of these programs, they lead to this folder: 

https://i.gyazo.com/e7dbb6419934652ba04a5ca88f105ba6.png

I have also tried MalwareBytes, both programs find a few malicious files but I always seem to get a few back. Is there any way I can get rid of them for good? Any help would be appreciated. 

Also, I have tried countless times to Google the problem but I seem to be the only one with these files.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im generally curious as to how oshi has made his way up to chilling with the likes of baauer and skrillex. Im not trying to bash him, his project is a stellar example of how far you can get through pretty much just soundcloud. I just cant get into his uploads. I enjoyed his remix of cavalier but thats about it at this point. 

Is it just a good combination of likeable music and luck? Or is there some secret team behind the project?  </TEXT>

But probs to Wan for ending the film on such a beautiful note. Ed and Lorraine dancing together was just the perfect ending.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely agree. I think the first film worked very well on its own. It didn't need two sequels to elaborate on the "further" or whatever it was called. 

 My favourite part about the Insidious series is the title intros. The words covering the entire screen and the violins lowering in pitch are really effective at setting the mood. They are also terrifying.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Its been over three weeks since it was released. What are everyone's thoughts? Still similar? 

I have grown to enjoy the record a whole lot more than my first few listens. With that being said, there are a lot of songs I simply have no interest in. My most played tracks are *Points*, *Put That Away and Talk To Me*, *Waves Know Shores* (except for the weird blip noises towards the end) and *Modern Soul* (my absolute favorite off the record).

I would rate his discog like this:

1. Enough Thunder EP
2. James Blake
3. Overgrown
4. The Color In Anything
5. Klavierwerke EP </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the best films I have seen this year. I can't stop thinking about it. I really love movies where the characters are stuck in an unfathomable situation and  Green Room does that but up to fucking 100. The gun negotiation scene HAS to be my scene of the year. Such a WTF moment where I and the characters knew they were in for something deadly. 

Potential spoiler questions:

- What else were the Neo-Nazis talking about? I understood their talk about the green room situation but I felt like they were also mentioning past events and such? 


- Why did the Nazi leader kill the other guys with laced heroin?


- Did you enjoy the ending?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Finally gave this film a re-watch after finishing a list of films I needed to see. I just can't get it out of my head. One of the best zombie movies I have seen! Something about the world and all the little details we are shown are so damn interesting to me. 

Favorite scenes throughout: 

- The letter Jim's parents write. It really humanized the effects of the infection for me, something that other zombie films fail to do.
- When the four characters go shopping.
- The rocket Jim notices through the trees after escaping his execution/death. Can anyone explain this scene for me? it definitely felt like his little own "moment" before going completely rambo on the soldiers. Is it supposed to indicate that there is maybe normal life elsewhere? Or the realization that Jim is just a tiny part of life in general? 

I really want to talk about all aspects of this film!

<TITLE> The Witch is the most fitting movie to see at an outdoor cinemas! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-18 01:41:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What an amazing experience. Late at night, the screen was shrouded in trees, a full moon and a little bit of wind. Probably the best movie i have seen at an outdoor cinema. It was so eerie when the wind would rustle the trees during parts of the movie. 

Oh, and the movie. HOLY SHIT. Could not stop thinking about it afterwards. The last few scenes really stuck with me. Really unique atmosphere. It almost reminded me of Blair Witch Project. 

Anyone else have positive experiences with this movie? And a side question, can anyone link/tell me some interesting things about the lore?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trying to wrap my head around this one. Same goes for Bondax (5mil followers) and Gold Panda (5.6mil) who get less than 100k plays on some tracks. What causes this? I have considered fake followers, but come on. 

It could be the number of tracks they have currently uploaded. Over 700 tracks? I can imagine how annoying it would be with Mad Decent being everywhere on peoples feeds.

<TEXT> What garryyo said:

It's like that moment in gone home where you realize there is no conspiracy or ghost or anything other than the complete mundane. You are disappointed, but you are mostly disappointed in yourself for thinking that there was something else, not at the game. and i am impressed with the game, for making me think things that aren't real and getting me caught up trying to figure things out that might have a simpler, more plausible explanation.

This game is rife with the feeling of how unfair and dumb normal life can be, and how your mind races to much more exciting things when it gets the chance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Comment from Soundcloud on the matter:

Beyond the full-year financials for 2014, which reflect those of a company in a strong growth stage, they show that, in 2015, we secured $77m of incremental capital, some of which came from our existing investors, demonstrating their belief in the future of the company, and the rest of which is a flexible credit line from Tennenbaum Capital Partners, an attractive option for companies like SoundCloud, who have a solid credit rating and are on a clear path to global success.

<TEXT> Jesus. Pretty pissed off at this point. I ordered two black xl shirts during the wdi sale last year in november i think? Anyway. I look at the tracking one day and see that it had made it to my country (australia), but the most recent update was that it was making its way back to america?! 

I email wedidit and they respond by saying they just got it back and that they will send it out. And here i am. Still waiting for it. Tried tweeting at nick but no response. Also tried emailing again but no response. 

I know they recently got a whole new merch team but there seems to be no difference. Get your fucking shit together!!! So at this point i have sent you guys 60 bucks for what seems to be jack shit. Now i am contemplating whether or not to buy stuff in the next drop.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When you stab an npc and the knife goes into their shirt and no wound appears, just their clothes texture that was there in the first place with maybe a little bit of blood. The wound wont be there at all. Its like shooting a wall, too. In most games, a bullet shot will show up on the wall. How is this any different to a body and a wound or any other interactions? 

Is this technically difficult to overcome? Is something developers/designers think about much? 

Hopefully ive explained it well enough to bring out a discussion. Are there any games that handle this situation well?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the reply. To an extent, yes. The media must have some idea about this current conception and act upon it. Whether it be through news, advertisements, even television shows. That being said, I do think people are becoming aware of this and doing something about it. Probably the most notable shift is the change to Netflix! Consumers love choice, and Netflix are all about that. 

I agree with you. Now that I have spent some time with the topic itself, I am aware of what information I read and whats garbage and what not.

Definitely tricky putting it into essay format. There is heaps of information about it, though.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys, first time posting here.

My group and I are doing a big campaign for a local beach. Our main idea is revolved around each season being full of things to do, giving people a reason, say, to go the beach during winter. 

We have a presentation soon, which has already been completed. I was just reaching out for help with some themes/one word ideas that really tie it all together. I was thinking something along the lines of 'compatibility' or bringing the seasons together.

any ideas/discussion would be great help. thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its explained earlier on in the movie and basically the witch would steal children, make one child stand facing the wall while the witch killed the other child. Its one of the more prominent stories within the film so you know exactly whats going in when its revealed. 

Was it just me or was the lore and stories actually quite unsettling? It was extremely well done.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For those who cant be bothered watching or just want the unusual highlights (everything I type is said by the "doctor" in the video):

Beginning - Sloppy explanation of what the method actually does. Talks about either being a 'left' or a 'right' and this can be determined by sitting down with a piece of fabric one at a time on each butt cheek. 

1:20 - The girl is a 'left'. Doctor explains her posture is like a car veering to the left. 

3:10 - Does a fucking bizarre super twist on her, pushing her legs into the window by accident. 

4:38 - Doctor explains that he can feel whats wrong with the patients back/body by touching a certain area and then feeling ridges in the neck that tell him if the area needs correcting. Explains that he adjusts the bones the body cant adjust itself.

10:30 - Explanation of her heart being compressed due to posture and the weather or something. 

They're all the weird bits of the video, overall its just total bs. Worth the watch! </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Dreamcast][IDK]Shooter on a cruise ship (not Dynamite Cop) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-08 11:52:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Platform(s):Dreamcast

Genre: Shooter, action.

Estimated year of release: I recall playing around 2001.

Graphics/art style: nearly birds eye view (cant remember), 3d definitely. 

Notable characters: played as a man (maybe a cop/spy?), i think you could choose between a few different ones.

Notable gameplay mechanics: beat em up of kind of game, could pick up weapons from ground. a lot of the environment was destructable (i think!) 

Other details: the game was set on a cruise ship. i recall the very last mission which was finding the main enemies home base on an island.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im guessing for wsn, something fucked up during contracts and stuff when flume left. Its not like Flume can just simply say im out and hes out, he's obviously contributed towards the production of the ep so technically its his as well as emohs. Its a huge bitch sorting out all that shit and takes forever going back and forth, conflicting schedules, emailing, etc etc. 

Emoh obviously has the finished product in his hands but releasing it for free on his own would fuck over the label and their already set up contracts (read up on shlohmo and jeremih's collab ep and their label problems. Death grips too!)  </TEXT>

They were at the forefront of the whole "trap" movement and came in at the perfect time. They stopped the project when it became saturated as fuck with copycats and brickwalled bullshit.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> How well can your machine lop the Griffen? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-18 07:17:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know it completely depends on the systems you guys are running, but I'd like to see some comparisons. My machine usually takes around 44 lops. I have heard that with the latest Griffen (the 29 Despos Model), a lop can be completed within 25 cycles!! The tubes I use to complete the lop in under 50 cycles are Vebrose 25 C tubes. 

A quick tip would be to lubricate the ends of your tubes using that prefoltute gel that comes in the box of your main routing system! Incredible stuff.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I never get to tell this story! Its kind of messed up and involves an innocent party, gate crashers, and a lot of blood.. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-12 18:13:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This happened a couple of years ago now. I was at a seventeenth birthday party with my girlfriend. I did not know the host personally as she was a close friend of my girlfriend's friend. The party was in a dodgy suburb but I sorta shook off that thought because it was a seventeenth. The party itself was fine, no dramas involving drugs or alcohol. A guy came out, turned the music down and told us to keep our eyes out because some people were trying to gate crash (get in to the party). Moments later, the host's mum comes sprinting through the gate screaming "GET INTO THE HOUSE!"  I hear glass breaking, look up and see a wave of bottles being thrown over the roof into where everyone was congregating. I was so out of it and thinking to myself what the fuck is happening? I let everyone into the house as I held the door open and I could see shirtless men running around bashing the absolute shit out of each other. So there was about 60 people huddled into the living room of this tiny house while absolute chaos was happening outside. People were crying, rumours were spreading and the noise was getting a lot louder. An older guy rushed into the house saying the gate crashes had brought back two carloads of friends and were destroying everything. Seconds later the hosts brother stumbles inside with his face COVERED IN BLOOD. There was deep slashes on his forehead and cheeks and he was bleeding very very badly. He was rushed into his room and at that point someone had called an ambulance and the police. News spread that the host's mum had been hit by a table while she was trying to stop the chaos that was happening throughout her house. Eventually the gate crashers fled and the police arrived. We all left one by one and the damage done to the property was just devastating. Glass everywhere, blood, broken furniture, beer bottles, their garden was ruined, neighbours cars had been broken into and damaged badly. It was a very bad end to such an innocent party. The brother had been cut with a machete and ended up getting plastic surgery. We were all very lucky that they didnt storm the house or anything crazy like that. I always think back on it and wonder how they are doing sometimes. There were a few articles online that I will try and find to link here. 

TL;DR: Innocent party got way out of hand and gatecrashers slit open a guys face with a machete. Damage everywhere. 

Have you guys ever experienced out of hand parties similar to this?

Or try youtube
Really low budget films will be hard to find 
Reality would be to purchase a physical copy
Especially if the movies are old
Nothing beats a physical copy

<TEXT> I bought a large police cop shirt probably a month before the new merch came out. I never got an email saying the police cop shirt had been posted. I know this because after i had purchased some of the new merch, a couple days later i received an email saying my new merch had been shipped. The police cop shirt wasnt on there so im guessing my order has just been forgotten about. I tried emailing them, tweeting them but no replies, which is weird because i emailed them about when the new merch was coming out and i got a response within a few days. 

Totally agree. Really bad customer service. I understand where theyre coming from about just a group if friends fucking around making merch and music, but they really should hire a guy who just responds to emails or helps out with orders.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This movie will destroy your ears. I have never experienced a movie as loud and as ear-piercing as this one. I wasn't afraid of the content within the movie itself, I was afraid of the next huge wall of noise that I knew was eventually going to happen. 

I may as well share my thoughts about the movie too. It was very weird. I struggled to realize if I should be trying to take the movie seriously or just accept the fact that its a pretty far out there concept. The 'ghost' thingo taking complete control of their Macbooks, removing the red cross buttons, disabling certain controls and so on. It made me frustrated seeing a movie that relied on literally the loudest jump scares to pass off as a horrifying and shocking movie. 

What did you guys think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's always interesting going way back to hear your favorite artists past work. I have to say, Shlohmo's discography is some of the best stuff I have ever listened to. Beat Tape '09, 'Fine, Thanks', Shlohmoshun Deluxe, Shlo-Fi, Camping, Bad Vibes, Vacation, Laid Out, No More, and now Dark Red. You can really tell how much he has progressed and moved forward giving it all a listen. 

Even before Shlohmo he went under the name Henry From Outer Space and released an entire album full of the craziest shit that no one can find. I have searched the internet for it and I know its out there but I cannot find it.

<TEXT> Shark films are definitely either a hit or miss when it comes to delivering a solid movie that is both realistic and somewhat scary. The Reef has a lot of intense scenes that made me squirm in my seat while staying in the realistic boundaries of an actual attack. The shark is more of a natural predator rather than a smart and evil beast. 

There were a few problems that were noticeable throughout the movie but I'd say its realistic shark attack scenes made it a great film! Its available on Netflix too.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Shlohmo - Dark Red: First thoughts. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-19 16:24:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First of all, I am a huge fan of Shlohmo. I will try not to let that get in the way of my first thoughts of his new LP. Yes, it was leaked today and it is out there and very easy to find. I listened to this album in bed, with the lights out, and with my good headphones on.

For those of you expecting something similar to his previous LP, Bad Vibes, prepare to completely shocked. Dark Red is unlike anything I have ever heard before. I am saying that with both positive and negative reasons. A recurring and dominant part of the album is the intricate drum work. The beats on each track are fast paced, loaded with broken, stretched out samples and gritty. Gritty is the word I would use to describe this album. 

Funnily enough, Dark Red strangely reminds me of Arca's Xen. Mainly from the strange synth melodies that are on most of the tracks. The whole album has a VERY unsettling vibe, it almost made me uncomfortable. 

Now, I feel like I should compare Dark Red to Bad Vibes mainly due to the fact that it is Shlomo's only other album and it features some of his most popular tracks that people know of. Firstly, Dark Red did not feel like a 'headphone' album, unlike Bad Vibes. I feel like Dark Red would be most effective when played out loud. Secondly and most importantly, the style and theme of this album is COMPLETELY different to Bad Vibes. 

TL;DR: I really can't describe my experience with this album, it is very unique and you will probably need to listen to it more than once to get the hang of it.

<TEXT> I went to a sixteenth party and at the end of the night the brother of the host had been sliced in the face with a machete. Yep. A fucking machete. The party was in a slightly dodgy area of where I lived. The party was fine until the parents came out and said to stay out at the backyard because there was a few people trying to force their way in. About ten minutes later a guy came rushing through and screamed GET IN THE FUCKING HOUSE!!! Out of nowhere, I saw bottles being thrown over the roof, smashing everywhere onto the ground. I was one of the last people to get inside and I glanced back and saw about 20 guys with no shirts on sprint through the gates and into the backyard, it was a full on brawl. There was about 60 people in this tiny house. All we could hear was absolute chaos happening outside. The front door opens and the brother of the host stumbles in with his face COVERED in blood! Word had gotten around quickly that he had been slashed multiple times in the face with a machete and the mother had been hit in the back with a table. It was absolute chaos!!! The police arrived later and all of us were questioned. There was a news piece on it which I will link later. 

TL;DR: Went to a party and someone got slashed in the face with a machete. Also had to get plastic surgery.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live in Perth and I have been experiencing very weird internet speeds recently. I am downstairs and my modem is upstairs (not that far apart) and I could happily get up to around 2mb download speeds. As of the past couple of weeks, it feels like my internet is getting slower and slower. Download speed is currently 0.26mb/s and it absolutely sucks. Could this be my problem? Should I call up Bigpond and ask them to reset my connection from their end? There must be a reason for this!

I picked up my new System today. It took me days to get running properly with the addition of 4 Static Trespers. I had them connected, 2 into the Sedret De-Esser and the other 2 into the main board. Straight after I did this, an error must have come up somewhere within the main board and it directly de-pletherised the Static Trespers!!! The Trespers unplugged themselves in reaction to the error and began squirting out the Gel that powers them. It went absolutely EVERYWHERE IN MY APARTMENT!! I am so angry and now my Trespers are ruined and my whole System is covered in shitty gel.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thought I would share what I liked and what I disliked about the finale. Feel free to add to the list!

Positives:
- The massacre scene was very well done. It took our expectations of an ending where all the characters have a happy resolution, which is what most of us were wanting to see, and turned it upside down and completely shocked us. 
- Dandy's character arc was completed and perfected, with the epitome being the massacre. 
- No major characters were left out of some sort of resolution. 

Negatives:
- The massacre scene can be seen as a cheap and easy way of ending the series because of how many subplots there were that needed to be resolved. 
- Most of the episode felt very rushed and left me wanting more. 
- The twins heads. Oh god. This ruined the episode for me at some points because of how easy you could tell which one was fake. Theres even one point where you can see the fake head (during the water tank bit). 
- Jimmy and Desiree seemed to have forgotten about the massacre completely after a few scenes.
- The whole scene where Dandy gets ambushed by the remaining freaks felt very rushed and not even real. I was wondering at some points if this was a dream sequence by the twins. 
- Elsa's visit by the Halloween guy also felt very rushed. When he came previously, he would talk to each character in depth for a certain amount of time. Here, he sort of just walks in and stabs her.

<TEXT> So my Blu-Ray copy of Enter The Void arrived today. I put it in my LG Player and hop into bed. Within seconds, a huge wall of text appears: THIS DVD IS LOCKED. PLEASE CHANGE YOUR PLAYERS REGIONAL CODE. 

So i go into my players settings to change my regional code, and theres apparently a password I need to put in before I can change it and I have no recollection of making a password in the first place! 

Absolute bullshit. Especially after making the purchase and being ready to watch a movie to be suddenly faced with a stupid and unnecessary problem.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This question is so hard to answer because you can find them in many different ways. It could be as simple as manipulating a vocal sample from a random sample pack, to the producer actually recording vocals themselves or asking someone for their vocals.

<TEXT> I just got the M-Audio Av40's today and I set them up and... I am very happy with the clarity of the highs and how they retain that clarity when turned up loud. The biggest problem I am encountering unfortunately is the lower frequencies. I have positioned them properly and it just sounds so 'phase-y'. When I walk around my room there are certain areas when I can really hear the bass. I think my main problem is that I have a huge room (imagine a normal sized bedroom and a kitchen together).
So yeah, the lower frequencies pretty much hurt my ears. Any suggestions? Invest in a sub? Buy better monitors? I got these for 240 for the pair so of course they wont be stellar quality but I want to get the most out of them.
Thanks! </TEXT>

Problem is that its quite hard to achieve that level of realism and intensity without proper equipment and the team/orchestra to perform it. Can I achieve something along the lines of what I have linked through the use of samples and vst's? Any help will be appreciated. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am looking to buy a decent/cheap pair of monitors. Since I have mainly made music through headphones, I know next to nothing about what I need to get them running and how to treat a room properly to get the best out of them. 

I have quite a large room, with my computer etc. in the corner. My budget is $400-$600. What I need from you guys is the best monitors that are cheap but worth the price for a standard first pair, if i need an audio interface or not, and ultimately, if monitors are worth it if the room they are in isnt treated properly. 

Thank you!

Have a good listen. Sound like something familiar? 

If you didn't notice, it is this: https://soundcloud.com/flume/lorde-tennis-court-flume-remix

Uploading someone else's remix that you had no participation in is the biggest dog move you can pull from a producers point of view. I was expecting some variation at least when i first pressed play but NOPE. The whole track is exactly the same and is flooded with tags making it look like its his. 

Just wanted to shine a light on this topic because this happens a lot. Bit of a no-brainer, though. The actual remix nearly has three million hits in less than two weeks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The songs he produces sounds like they were made by a thirteen year old. Maybe he thinks that putting "Festival Trap" in all of his remix titles makes it seem like he has discovered something unreal and original. Makes me angry how he boasts about how much effort he spends in the studio and that he deserves this fame when really his remix of Spaceman by Hardwell has just been high-passed and sidechained like a mother f with a trap beat over the top. 

Oh well. I guess thats what people want these days. But seriously, there is SO MUCH hidden talent lying around if you spend a good few hours searching for new and innovative music.

<TEXT> Looking at HARD Summer, Ultra, all the festivals that attract large crowds, the lineups dont get me excited anymore. Its just the same djs, the same live acts all squashed into one big mess. Of course when youre there you are having a great time, but I am looking at this from a different perspective. What will the lineups be like in a couple of years? Will they be the exact same? Surely maybe at least a few acts will rise to fame and they will be added but thats just a minor adjustment. And what about crowd numbers? If attendants look at the lineup and go 'hey wait a minute i saw these people last year', numbers would start decreasing. 

Just something I wanted to discuss with you guys :)   </TEXT>

<TEXT> We have similiar music tastes. Some great artists to branch off of: 

https://soundcloud.com/manlikezha - Grime, garage, uk funky.

https://soundcloud.com/killjoybadboy - grime, uk funky, house. killer beats!

https://soundcloud.com/diversa - chilled, nice flowing beats.


https://soundcloud.com/asamusicofficial - ambient, garage, some grime.

https://soundcloud.com/ikickedacloudonce - crazy beats. very diverse.


Some labels to keep an eye on: 

https://soundcloud.com/fentplates - nice chilled beats mostly.

https://soundcloud.com/pilerats - best australian prods. 

https://soundcloud.com/gradient-audio - very diverse range of genres - dubstep, ambient, chill.

https://soundcloud.com/tumbleaudio - brilliant club music. grime, uk funky, house. keep a good eye on this.

Tl;DR: Make a soundcloud account. Start off with one artist, end up with hundreds. So much fun finding new+different artists.

<TEXT> To me Diplo is just another one of 'those' producers. I loved the first album he put out as Major Lazer because it was just so different to what I usually listen to. Now he's just another trap producer looking for the next banger. Everyones like: "mannn diplos set was fucking banging!!!". Its just jamaican shit with him screaming GET UP every two minutes.

Edit: also, revolution was like knifes in my ears.

1. Wake up. Put a pair of socks on. 
2. Commit to wearing this particular pair of socks all day. ALL DAY. I don't care what happens during your day, just keep them damn socks on. 
3. You will feel the urge to take them off. RESIST. It is worth it I promise. 
4. When it comes to bed time, get in a comfy position. Now, when you are just about to doze off, take your socks off using your feet. 
5. Experience the fucking brilliant sensation of your feet that have just been exposed to the soft material of the sheets in your bed. I cannot tell you how satisfying this feels in words. 
TIP: for more satisfaction, have fresh sheets. 

TL;DR: Wear socks all day, take off when in bed. Have the best sleep of your life.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> My experience at Future Music Festival. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-04 05:11:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Before you read this I would like to place emphasis on the fact that this is a matter of opinion and taste. 

Future Music Festival this year donned the likes of Adventure Club, Sub Focus, Baauer, Knife Party, Netsky and many many more. I was keen to see all of these acts. 

The day began with Adventure Club in the boiler room. I See Monstas had just finished playing and the crowd was waiting for AC and their classic dubstep sound they were known for. They opened with some big festival banger, which wasn't surprising as they probably wanted to get the crowd going. This is where the reason why I am writing this post comes in. Their whole set was literally festival bangers the whole way through. Now, I don't want this post just to be a biased rant about artists playing songs to please the crowd, but what happened to artists playing their own tracks for a large majority of their set? Isn't that the reason why we go see them play? Even Sub Focus, who played live, dropped one song that was identical to Martin Garrix's Animals. 

And these types of songs were played throughout the whole day. Im not too sure about other attendees but this gave me a huge headache. The night was topped off with Knife Party's awful, awful set that sounded like nearly every other set i heard that day. Thank god we left early to see Gesaffelstein play, which was the highlight of my day. He played an intense show. 

Overall, including the hefty $175 ticket, it was an average day. This really came down to what I have said above. It was a huge let down witnessing great acts follow the trend just to please the crowd. 

Maybe im going to the wrong festivals.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Remixing songs without having stems. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-02-23 16:02:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I want to write this post to hopefully inspire some and also to give an insight into how a complete track can be remixed without the remixer having the single stem files. 

I think the most important priority in this case is song selection. If you are remixing a song that has A LOT going on in it, then it is going to be a bit tricky to single out elements you want to use. Which is why I choose songs that have distinct elements that I can sample and use. I use Abletons Sampler to find bits and pieces through out the song. 

I had a go at remixing Culprates "My Rock": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB3PnlMUbTA

As you can hear, there are some very useable bits and pieces throughout the track.

Heres my remix: https://soundcloud.com/abcdegrapes/culprate-my-rock-grapes-cheeky

Some of my productions are solely sample-based and that clearly shows in the remix I did. 

Another interesting way to remix a song without having stems is to use Abletons "convert to MIDI" feature. When done right, this can producer amazing results. Giving you the MIDI information of say, a melody or even a drum pattern within a track. This can be tricky to get right but it is worth having a shot. 

I know this post comes across as simplistic but hopefully I provoked some thought into how you remix a riddim. 

I would also like to hear how you guys remix tracks without stems!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The main reason I like session view is because you can get ideas down really quickly and have something going in a matter of minutes. I really don't think it is good for writing a proper full track but it is a great way of starting a track. Once I have a good idea down then I usually switch to arrangement view to further improve that idea. Session view is also great for storing MIDI clips that you have bounced to audio. 

Two reasons why you should use arrangement view:

- You can see the waveforms of audio files in arrangement view, not just the clip that is playing. 
- Automation is a lot easier and efficient. 

Just my two cents!

<TEXT> I think actual stereo widening is when you take something from say, the right channel, and feed it into the left channel, making the sound fuller and livelier. I would warn you not to widen sounds that are in the low to mid frequency range, as that can really fuck up harmonics and other important listening factors. 

Here is why you should not widen sub bass https://soundcloud.com/abcdegrapes/culprate-my-rock-grapes-cheeky

I did the mistake of turning the spread knob in Operator to one hundred percent and you can definitely hear how it fucked up the entire mix when the other elements come in around 27 seconds in. 

You learn from your mistakes I guess! I never got around to fixing it as you can tell! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-01-28 15:33:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am writing this post to hopefully give you guys some inspiration and also to look at Operator in a completely different way for what it is classically known for. Now before you read this post, please consider the fact that I am writing this for producers who create ambient, chill out or experimental. This post probably wont be handy for neuro tech heads.

A large majority of my productions include an instance of Operator in some shape or form. I like to use it because I can open up the initial patch and already have some source of inspiration. A simple sine wave can create the most beautiful leads, given that you have a melody that works with the wave well. The lead in this track is just a sine wave. 

Have a listen ~ https://soundcloud.com/abcdegrapes/drown
And this is what the channel looked like ~ http://imgur.com/QTC4XWn
Notice the little pitch window has been activated and the spread has been increased. I used this to give the sound some space and to widen it up a bit. Try not to over complicate your sounds!

Again, another tune that used just a sine wave as the lead, but this time I added a Camelphat and increased the Bitcrusher and Distortion knobs to give it some luscious grit. https://soundcloud.com/abcdegrapes/tonal-garden

I hope this post gave some producers an insight into how easy Operator can be utilized and woven into your productions. 

TL;DR = The greatest ideas are the simplest! Dont over complicate!

<TEXT> I was in a similar situation i guess (basically just on holidays with no access to laptop). The best thing you can do in my opinion is to simply listen to new or old music. Listen to it over and over again. Maybe it'll inspire you, maybe it will encourage you to learn something new, because after however long you are away for, you will be wanting to get right back into music making. 

The good thing about this is that you don't necessarily need access to the internet. It could just be an old album you are listening to. Maybe study and listen to the flow of the album and how each separate song works with each other until the end. Or if its just a single song, find a sound or vibe you really like and use your imagination to figure it how it was made. 

Thats just my two cents! Looking forward to other ideas. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You definitely need more time practising mate. A week is nothing! If you want to develop your skills and work on your weaknesses, you're going to have to practise a lot more. I used Ableton for nearly 2 years before I started using it properly to write songs. 

With that said,  there is no secret recipe for making complex sounds. This also depends on what kind of music you're making. If its bass-orientated, process your bass sounds so there is lots of movement so it keeps it interesting. I am no expert on bas sounds but this can be done through effects like EQ'ing (notch etc), flanger, phaser, even a grain delay. 
If youre making very melodic and rhythmic tunes, reverb and delay is your best friend. I also use gentle distortion after my reverb to crispen up the tail of the sound. 

That is a very simple explanation but through practise and hard work, these techniques and solutions will come to you naturally! Be patient and have fun. 

Good luck </TEXT>

<TEXT> Once you have your plugins and samples down, don't focus on expanding them. You will end up with this huge collection of samples and vst's that you don't even use and you will spend more time looking through them instead of solid production time. Focus more on "how did they make this" instead of "what did they use to make this". 

With that said, my favourite plugins are: 

Transient Shaper: http://www.schaack-audio.com/transientshaper.html

CamelCrusher: http://www.camelaudio.com/camelcrusher.php

LexHall: http://www.lexiconpro.com/en-US/products/pcm-native-reverb-plug-in-bundle

I don't really use 3rd party VST's very much. Ableton's Operator and Tension are absolutely fine. You just need a few extra layers if creating, for example, a bass sound. 

Samples, in my opinion, are really easy to find and build up. Just google search what ever you are looking for and then add 'samples' at the end. 

If you have the equipment, recording old vinyl samples is a lot of fun and opens you up to new sounds you may have not heard before. 

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So basically this producer uploaded a tutorial on how he made his recent 'trap' song. He commented asking why people were disliking the video and I responded saying because there is nothing special in the tune that stands out and your'e just following the trend that is most popular at the moment. Obviously, I received a lot of hate responses.
What are your opinions on this matter? Personally, I hate it. I think producers should try and evolve their productions without taking sharp turns and being influenced by popular trends and culture. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Been pimping out our area at the moment. It looks ballin, especially the new chest storage area. I will be expanding this pimpation onwards to the wheat farm, castle and other places. Been using lots of hardened clay for a nice medieval look. Thought of these ideas as i was pooing.
