<TEXT> Why is it so hard to find these books? And an affordable price at that? I love them and I found the first 3 at $4 CAD each in a used bookstore! I really want to get my hands on the next trilogy. Does anyone know why they're like this or where I could find them? They aren't even in regular bookstores. </TEXT>

I was at the grand exchange trying to make my money back after being killed by a stupid wizard, and this guy played a prank on me where he disguised himself as gold lol. Then he asked what I was up to and I told him about my situation and he gave me 1000k gp! Thank you kind person!!!! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't played runescape in about 10 years and just recently got back into it. I'm so glad the old version still exists!

Anyway, I barely know what I'm doing now bc I forgot everything and all my skills have been reset for some reason so I didn't have anything. 

Then this one player came up to me and asked to trade, so I told him I didn't have anything to trade but he insists we trade and he gave me 3 rune axes (I think?) and told me to go sell them in GE! I was so surprised because most of the players I've come across are so mean to (kind of) noobs like me. So I just wanted to thank you, kind stranger, for helping me out :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, the best you can do for him is be there for him through surgery and treatment (if he needs either/or). Also if you can stay with him at the hospital if he needs to stay overnight it's really helpful to have someone there.  It really all depends on his type of tumour/location/treatment. He might need a lot of help or he might not. Just let him know you are there for him if he needs you and that he can count on you. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why are people making Instagrams for their kids? It's seems pathetic. Using children to get likes/followers on social media is ridiculous...and then they advertise for prams and bibs or whatever and they have "fans" and people sending them shit. People just eat it right up.

It's honestly just ridiculous and makes the parents look stupid. They are using their child just to take pictures of and as a source of income. Isn't that exploitation? Maybe just let your damn child have a childhood??? Maybe they should get off their damn phone and actually play w the damn child THAT THEY BIRTHED.

Idk how to explain it there's just something so wrong with having a child and using them like that. And it infuriates me that the comments on those pictures are like "baby goals" or just people generally not seeing anything wrong with what those parents are doing. 

Am I making any sense? Anyone agree?  </TEXT>

 I finished 70 straight weeks of chemo in January and have been suffering from terrible depression ever since. Can't work for all the same reasons. I feel exactly the same, I don't enjoy anything anymore and I'm too tired to do anything.

<TEXT> I live on a really small lot in a tent. Yesterday I woohoo'd with Sergio Romeo and ended up pregnant. He was very unhappy about it when I told him. He hates children so he won't let me move in with him. It is hard enough providing for myself but now I will have a child to take care of as well. :(

Edit: gave birth and haven't been able to sleep since! My son cries a lot and I'm getting tired of it! Trying to get child services to come free me of this giant burden.

Edit: well, I lost my son due to neglect and I thought it would be better that way but now I miss him a lot. I've spent months try to scrap together enough money to build a small shelter. It's not much but at least I have a roof over my head! I tried to get my child back now that I'm more stable but it seems he's been adopted already :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the 2nd semester of 12th grade I was taking a biology class but I dropped it after a couple days to take an online class. 

Well, a couple days later I was in the library during that class period and the same biology class I dropped came through to use the computer lab while I was sitting and checking something on my phone at one of the tables. Then a couple of minutes later the teacher came back to where I was sitting and he was so damn mad and he was said in a low angry voice, "so you would rather do this than sit and work?" And just to make him more angry I said yeah and then he just left. 

But then I kind of started tearing up because I was embarrassed at the fact that he caught me looking like I was a lazy ass because I'm not and I really had personal reasons that I won't go into for dropping that class and I was just mad at him for making me feel like a jerk because I wasn't...he didn't know shit yet he was judging me. 

Anyway, it was always awkward when I saw him in the halls after that. We never talked again after that and I feel like it was a loss to me because he was a nice guy and he was really helpful to me. </TEXT>
