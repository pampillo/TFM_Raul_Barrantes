<TEXT> Yeah, I explained that.  If you aren't frustrated with Rothfuss for his glacial pace then you have the patience of Job.  You don't think it's funny that a 10th Anniversary Edition of book 1 is likely to hit before the 3rd book does?  I guess I have an overdeveloped sense if the absurd. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be clear-I think from everything I've read that PR just wants to make this 3rd book awesome, to craft it to be as strong as the first two, to make a great story.  
The 10th anniversary edition of Name of the Wind is what makes me crazy-JUST FINISH THE STORY-don't try to get me to buy the first book again.  Finish this tale and then go on to another good tale.  This smacks of greed on the publisher's part to my mind. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good things come up those who wait, a watched pot never boils, you can't rush perfection..whatever.  The 3rd installment, Doors of Stone, will be done when it is done.  I understand that.  I appreciate that.  I totally respect that.  
What made me laugh out loud today is that there will be a special 10th anniversary edition of the first installment, which I guess they expect us to run out and buy, BEFORE the 3rd book is even done!!!
That is a bit much.  This really makes me appreciate Michael J. Sullivan's approach-he finishes the ENTIRE series before he releases even the first book.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I defer to your experience of course. I had in mind a restraint system  more like a standing harness you could sit down in.  

The larger idea is that standing is healthier than sitting.  While standing you engage the larger muscles in the hips and thighs, more calories are burned, circulation is improved, health problems like varicose veins, atherosclerosis, and deep vein thrombosis are impacted in a positive way.
Thanks for your thoughts, of course. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've always thought someone should invent and seat that would let truckers sit down or stand up while driving when they wanted to.  The health benefits would, I think, be enormous.  We all know that what gets a lot of these hardworking guys is the negative impacts of diet and stasis.  They sit for hours at a time and then have to jump down (very strenuous when you are overweight) into weather, run out and strap or lift something, then climb back in.  Anyway, interested in any thoughts. Also, if one of you patents this, please send me a million dollars.

<TEXT> Which sounds fine until you somehow wind up on the other end of it.  You don't even have to be involved with drugs or the cartels to be pigeonholed as an "enemy of the state" and then the same tactics are used on you for any old reason.  This is classic and this is predictable.
You've already seen massive consolidation of power around a single person rather than the institutions of democracy.  When his term is up what do you think he's going to do?  Fade sweetly into civilian life?  That's impossible for him as a person now-he is locked into the cycle of becoming a dictator and there are few ways out of that; assassination, prison, exile.   </TEXT>

His "strategy" is simply to prove that he doesn't have a small..pair of hands.  Like a small-time 3rd world dictator, every official act of his can be traced back to some petty personal insecurity he is overcompensating for-hence the MOAB- because he's impotent. </TEXT>

Where did you get your law degree?  You are a sad, self-righteous cheap bastard yourself (as evidenced by you very presence in this thread), so how do you get off judging a guy for grabbing a few cents worth of extra condiments?  It's not like he takes a bath in the stuff!  If the owner doesn't like it he can wise up and drop a small amount of condiment in the bag with purchase or put out a bottle.

<TEXT> We always think of the "culture " being pornography, drug abuse, nihilism, etc, but a large swath of the "culture" is just shallow, self-righteous conservatism.  In a way, that is very similar to the culture Christ had to deal with in his time.  This recent election has really opened my eyes to this, as I'm sure it has yours.  
This self-centered conservative culture is as corrosive as the other-maybe even more so because it has the sheen of morality while rejecting the Christ-taught ethos of "love your neighbor".
The only way to change these views in your young friend is to SHOW him another way.  Service is the body when faith is the spirit.  You aren't going to argue or proof him out of it.  Also, point him to an immersive scriptural experience-in the Word every day-the Word on the morning-the Word in the mid-day- the Word in the evening.  This is where transformation starts.
I would point him specifically to the parable of the Sower and point out that these theories he's preoccupied with ARE the thorns sucking the nutrients from the good soil-occupying the space that passion for Christ should </TEXT>

I do TEEs ( IMACOR), arterial lines, PIV, chest  tube and other drain removal, wound debridements, sew lacerations, apply and change wound vacs, change out tracheostomies, place trans pyloric dobhoff tubes.  I don't do all of those every day, but wouldn't be surprised to do some of those most days. </TEXT>

PAs in my state can do CVLS (IJs, not femoral or subclavian)-but the residents are desperate do them because they need a certain number-so generally you are just helping do those procedures.

<TEXT> I arrive before 5am-the other PAs and I are in charge of assigning the 28 patients.  Depending on how many residents we have we may see anywhere from 4-8 patients each.  
Usually I'll go do a physical exam, lab/micro/rad review, and type in the progress note with the plan for the day.  Then we will all (attending, fellow,resident, students, sometimes RT, sometimes Charge RN) do bedside rounds on half the unit.  There are 2 PAs there during the day and our 28 beds are divided into 2 loops.  While the "low side is rounding, the same thing is happening with another attending on the other side.  The attending surgeons sign off on our plan for the day or alter it.  It's very collaborative-everyone has input and no one is discouraged from challenging a plan or whatever.  Full-contact rounds.
This takes us to about 10am.  Then we really get to work doing procedures, calling consults, doing tertiary injury surveys, weaning vents, extubating or intubating people, talking to families, moving people in or out of the unit and responding to emergencies, changes in condition-all the bad stuff that happens to these people.  We usually get off after 5pm, just depending what's going on.
Last night I got off at 630pm because a patient became acutely hypotensive and I was at the bedside managing the vent, getting him on pressors, performing a bedside TEE to establish preload status, ordering stat labs, and generally trying to keep the guy from coding.  Fun! </TEXT>

I do direct patient care, vent management, bedside procedures, etc.  We are the continuity in the ICU as our fellows, residents, students, and military guys rotate through.  It's a ton of fun, always busy, great schedule (we make our own, 20 12-hour shifts every 6 weeks).  We are just above median for salary, but the schedule is the best. I have 4 kids, so I want to see them.
As a PA you have a lot of choice in what you do and where you work.  Just remember it's now a complete meritocracy-if you suck you won't do well; if you're good you'll be fine.  Also, you will never work for an MD or group that is NOT swamped.   Otherwise, they wouldn't need you, right? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pinhote trail near Talladega in Alabama-Mount Cheeha.  This is just east of Anniston/Oxford on I20.  The absolute best views in Alabama and LOTS of overlooks.  

The Dismals in northwest Alabama-I've heard are good.  Not been there myself, but been to Sipsey Wilderness right around there and had a ton of fun.

In Northwestern GA we like Amicalola Falls-hike to the Hike Inn, then do a section of the AT.

In TN and NC, our favorite section of the AT is Carver's Gap to Hwy 18 in NC.  It's about a 23 mile stretch.  You should take about 2 days to do that.  Any AT section is worth the walk, but that section with the "Balds" is really something else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off-if you need an eye exam, go get one.  I trust that, as adults, we can detect when one of our own senses has degraded to the point that an intervention is required.  At the very least our wives will let us know, right?
So it galls me that you can't buy disposable contact lenses in the US without an active script.  The Optometrists have decided that you need to be reexamine at least once a year.  Why this often?  $.  
So I say screw them.  I'm not dropping $100a year just for the privilege of buying the exact same lenses for 10 years in a row.
So, my frugal friends, simply buy from Europe.  I use VisionDirect, but I'm sure there are plenty of other companies that sell the exact product that you'd get here without paying the Optometrist's second mortgage with an unnecessary yearly eye exam.  If things get blurry, make an appointment. Duh. </TEXT>

They are being destroyed forever-not they have been destroyed and will never be undestroyed.  You are simply taking an idea you want to be true, twisting some verses in that direction and hoping it sticks.  Annihilationism has been refuted effectively for millennia.  It keeps popping up because people just can't believe a loving God would punish someone FOREVER!  That can't ACTUALLY mean forever-it must have been misinterpreted or Jesus must have been mistaken.
And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.

<TEXT> The quote I used was from a RC Theology website.  It wasn't saying that JP coined the term, just that he used it early and often, enshrining it in the practice of the RC Church.  The Vicar of Christ said it!  God's DIRECT representative on earth, no less...

1).  So, what you are saying is everyone, regardless of their heart, who has attended a mass AT ANY POINT has prayed to God.  Well, that just makes no sense.  I'm not even going to break that argument down because it is already broken.

2).  The whole praying to God through the saints is not correct either.  Supposedly you are asking the Saints to intercede for you in some regard-not praying directly to God.  Beyond the question of whether they can even hear you (no scriptural indication that they can, but I understand the RC Church holds Scripture as on equal authority as tradition-that is to say, degrades Scripture), you still aren't praying TO God.  Christ said He is the ONLY mediator-the ONLY mediator-the ONLY mediator.  Did I say the ONLY mediator?  Yes, the ONLY one.
For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,

<TEXT> On September 8, 1982, Feast of the Birth of Mary, within the context of a papal address to the sick (who so much need to know the power of co-redemptive suffering), John Paul calls Mary the Co-redemptrix of humanity for the first time: Mary, though conceived and born without the taint of sin, participated in a marvelous way in the sufferings of her divine Son, in order to be Coredemptrix of humanity. 

I agree that all salvation comes through Christ alone.  Your Church does not seem to agree with us, however.
My remark about Roman Catholics in hell stands on its own merits.  
"If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  Romans 10:9 
If the ignorant, misled have never prayed to Christ, only the pantheon of "Saints"-then they are damned.  
And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.

I'd wager there are RC who go their entire lives praying to St Anne or Mary-feeling too distant from Christ or God to pray directly to them.  Mary is so much more fluffy and lovable than mean old Jesus and Jehovah!Those Catholics are in hell.

<TEXT> Nope-the Second Eve dynamic is heresy.  We know there were heresies being promulgated even earlier than this one, so it's antiquity does not lend it legitimacy.  We know that it was Adams sin that condemned us-not Eve's.  We also have no indication that Jesus thought of her this way at all!  Eve was Adams wife.  Mary is Jesus's mother-they are NOT the same.
Co-redemptrix means exactly what it sounds  like.  That's why it's a heresy to call Mary that.  You can use the same logic to give David co-redeemer status.  Nobody does because he doesn't give the warm, soft, not-judgements fuzzy feeling that Mary does.  

Jesus is who we pray to, look to, worship, adore, hold as gracious and the ONLY mediator.  Mary sinned.

Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.

Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.

Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.
Matthew 10:29-31 

Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

<TEXT> I gotta agree with Eric.  I kind of also have to disagree with your premise that we are connected to all things.  This isn't backed up by any Scripture that I can recall.  This is more in line with Eastern mysticism or "the Force", if you want the modern concept brought into it.  
Our consciousness, even when we are as close as we will possibly be with God in eternity future, is still a separate thing from God's consciousness.  We aren't a drop falling into the ocean-we are eternally distinct creatures.  That thought, in and of itself, is kind of terrifying! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am completely uninterested in a debate because I know it will change your opinion and practice not a whit.  So,  if your goal is closeness to Christ and loving people better brings you closer to Him (it does), then go for it.  
Do not be surprised by the visceral Reformed Christian reaction against the extreme Marian devotion that we sometimes see that seems to blurs the lines.  I also feel like this extreme devotion is trotted out sometimes simply to illicit that reaction.- exploiting that "weakness" in an unedifying way.  At least that has been my experience in this sub on occasion.  Of course, not all my posts or comments are especially edifying either-I confess. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mostly moderate to large-sized evangelical churches.  I guess maybe half of my teaching pastors have been PhDs.  Grew up mainly in independent and southern Baptist churches.
I'm at the Church at Brook Hills in Birmingham AL. (Like 4500 member, but our small group is like 8 families).  We had David Platt for several years (wonderful) before he went to the IMB.  Now we have a Matt Mason who does not boast the same educational pedigree, but is clearly who God has chosen for this Church at this time. 
I guess my point is even mega-churches can be led by men who are qualified in God's eyes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as answering questions, I can see you've been as selective as I have, at least.

So, how did matter get here, again?  It was energy, right?  How did that energy get here?  Why do these things act in certain ways but not in others?  You've demonstrated that you have no real answers to any of these questions.  In fairness, you just don't have the equipment to answer them, so you pretend they can't be answered and aren't important.  That's fine.

In answer to the OP's question, in a universe (multiverse is a nonsense word, put down the comic book) of cause and effect, science cannot answer the question of cause.  Period.  So, matter is the ultimate argument for a Creator or uncaused Cause.

<TEXT> No, not really.   The two situations are analogous, but no analogy is perfect, just instructive.  Poking a hole in an analogy is a piece of cake (see what I did there?).  Let's go through the holes Humes pokes.

1.  Ignorance of the process doesn't preclude design or a Designer.  As finite beings, we might not even have the capacity to comprehend the process.  All we do know is God spoke-and from nothing, something.
2.  Here is the question of perception-ours is, and always will be limited.  However, it is amazing to note that the farther we look, or the closer we look, we perceive evidence of order.  There is not chaos.  That was laPlaces point-that every effect, if you can catalogue all the variables, can be traced to a cause.  A Cause.
3.  This is the most bizarre point-it seems to misunderstand itself and is essentially nonsense.  Any environment in which everything was made would be part of everything and therefore made at the same time-it would be part of the universe.
4.  We do have evidence that a sentient Being made a universe-this one!  The word universe encompasses everything-so there could not be another.  Again, nonsense.

Your point about all the evidence being absent is just a lack of processing power or a willful blindness.  I suppose it could be both.

Humes argument is just flash with little substance.  It plays well with a British accent, but makes little sense in the real world.  In some sense he takes advantage of the differences in scale.  But changes in scale do not help your argument at all.  Your point about inferring design according to differences between artificial and "natural" objects breaks down when the scale changes.  If you look at a rock microscopically it has patterns that adhere to laws-the same as the piece of cake.  That's the point.  "Natural characteristics" are designed-so there must be a Designer.  
In a universe of cause and effect, it must gall you to be in the side that denies there's a cause.

So, again.  Matter.  It's there... </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I guess we've reached the point in the discussion where you pretend that you have no idea what an analogy is.  That's fine.
Analogies pertaining to the discussion are very pertinent-and not being able to engage in them is very typical of atheists.  It just demonstrates a rigid, terrified, inflexible mind.  Since the best you can hope for is eternal oblivion, I don't blame you for that.

So, rather than just copy and paste your post and interject my thoughts in between each statement ( lazy, and worse, boring), let me sum up:  I contend matter is here because an omnipotent being willed it so and you contend matter is here because..., oh, science will figure it out one day.  That's where YOU'RE faith lies.
Science is great!  We can do way more stuff with it than without it.  I use it every day to keep people alive.   In fact, I use laPlaces Law every day to determine what setting I want to use for ventilator.  What I understand and you do not is that it simply can't answer the question I posed it.  It still won't be able to answer that question millennia from now when the molecules that used to be your body are something else entirely-stardust you like to think, or maybe a toilet.  
Atheism has intentionally ignored the search for primary causes because it is too humiliating for them.  Hilariously, they discover laws and don't think to ask, "why this way and not that?".  The answer to that question is the same one that bedivils them in regard to primary causes, the existence of matter, the existence of energy-because that's how God designed it!  That must be frustrating for you.

<TEXT> You know you're wife is there because you can smell her cooking dinner, and you know she's there because you know her intimately, you talk to and listen to her.  They aren't mutually exclusive.

I am not interested so much how matter came into being, the mechanics, because according to every observation ever made by a sentient being, you can't have something come from nothing.  

You are placing your faith in science.  You will always say "science just hasn't got there yet"-and the can will forever be kicked further down the road with the most obvious of facts out of your reach because of pride and arrogance.  You can't extend you life by an hour or keep your own hair from turning gray but you will look at an incomprehensibly vast creation and think you understand the tiniest sliver of it and pronounce "there is no God".  

Newton was right in his statement "*Planets, and Comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being."-and you could further distill this wisdom into "quarks and the laws by which cosmic inflation and dark matter operate could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful being".  No offense, but you are hardly a Newton.

You can't tell me my wife doesn't exist when I'm eating the steak she made me or when I'm lying next to her in bed at night.  You currently are just attempting to explain how the heat from the oven interacted with the beef to make it medium rare.  You haven't even thought to ask why it is on your plate at all.

<TEXT> Thanks for your very informative and detailed answer.  The existence of matter doesn't necessarily argue for the existence of God, per se, but it does argue for a beginning, which your excellent explanation postulates began with various forces obeying certain laws.  This then begs the question, where did those laws come from?  Where did heat come from?  Where did energy come from?  Right?
You simply can't get away from the realization that there must have been nothing at some point, or something at some point from which all the other somethings we observe relate to in some way.  
My point is that the current persistent assertion that "it just sploded " makes no sense according to all the laws we've been able to observe.  This doesn't mean "THERE IS A GOD", but it does mean that "THERE IS A GOD" is amore valid an argument than anything science has been able to put forth-it explains what is observed perfectly and cannot be disproven.  
Your answer, though very thoughtful and interesting, doesn't really explain anything at all.  You've simply said, "not matter, energy", which is utter nonsense.
I just believe in God because I happen to know Him.  You can too! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The RCC equates the authority of church tradition with the authority of the Bible.  Rather than elevating the traditions this practice degrades the authority of Scripture.  
So, they don't take it seriously.  How could God disapprove of them?  They go to mass, the go to confession, they pray to Mary,  buy indulgences...whatever.  Despite what they say, it is a form of works righteousness.  That means it's NOT the Gospel.  That also frees them up to go to psychics, have mistresses, participate in organized crime, pay and expect bribes; all vices we associate with that generation of RCC.  Lots of mobsters were "very devout" Catholics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Christ followers that hate ANYONE are just wrong.  They need to be corrected by their brothers/sisters in love and they need to repent.
As a Christian, I apologize for them.  I hope you come to find the love of God.  Realize He is actively pursuing you right now! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I understand.  Submit to your parents leadership and establish in your own mind if and how the Pastors behavior is anti-Christian.  Talk about it with them, of course.  If you submit to them
in a Biblical way, they won't "despise your youth", also in accord with the Scripture.  
Remember that God desires unity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A church member breaking the law is subject to the punishment prescribed by the law-they should admit in court FULLY what they've done in public and then submit without complaining to the ruling.  
THEN they are subject to the discipline of their church prescribed in the New Testament.  Just go read it.  It's all right there, step by step.  Realize that the goal of the discipline is their good and reconciliation.  The LOVING thing to do is the discipline.
It's all laid out in the Scriptures if you care to look! </TEXT>

<TEXT> That Pastor sounds like a fool.  I would submit to your parents if they wanted you to continue to go-but guard your heart from him.  God desires unity, not division-so someone who claims the role of a leader but is needlessly divisive is NOT performing Gods will and doesn't reflect Gods attitude, so that makes you wonder how close to God he really is.  See Ephesians 4 (the whole chapter, ESV ONLY!).
God Bless! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not to answer a single one of your questions, but to give you confidence and reassurance:  we are to glorify God with our minds, our hearts, and our wills.  Each of us has greater or lesser portions of each-but we can glorify Him just as well as ANYONE else by surrendering what we do have to Him.  
I'm convinced that some people just CAN't be Calvinists-they don't have the processing power.  I'm further convinced that a lot of people who do have the processing power SHOULDN'T be Calvinists because they don't have the willpower to resist the pride and arrogance that comes of being more correct than everyone else.
In short-we should bear with one another as Paul writes to the Church at Ephesus. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand where you are coming from.  Job felt that way too-Behold, I cry out, Violence! but I am not answered; I call for help, but there is no justice" in Job 19:7.  But Isaiah says the Lord of hosts is exalted in justice, and the Holy God shows himself holy in righteousness" in Isaiah 5:16. 

Still, we should not forget that God is far above our ability to judge and that Holy means separate, completely pure.  For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord" in Isaiah 55.   God's justice doesn't sleep, but we don't dictate the timing.

As to suffering-God works suffering in our lives to His purposes.  We don't understand what those are during the suffering, but can often look back and see His hand guiding us through it to where we are now.  We know that He allows it, but we trust that somehow it works for our good.

I will praise a God like that.

<TEXT> Found a good discussion article here:
http://www.centerforchristianapologetics.com/blogs/animal-pain-chapter-9-of-the-problem-of-pain-by-cs-lewis-by-jeff-jackson

The main points of Lewis are summarized here:  

"So what can we conclude from all of this? One, only God has immortality, two, only mankind has experienced the type of death that prevents the transcending experience back into the presence of God because of sin, and three, if animals do take part in a resurrection it is only because of Gods goodness to grant such an experience for the primary reason of granting joy mankind. Back to the question of whether all dogs go to heaven, its certainly speculation but seems there could be a possibility."

Again, just go read that chapter-he's such a pleasure to read!

Addm-sorry, I should say in the actual chapter Lewis discusses suffering of animals too, not just their possible resurrection. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a costume-that's what the modern equivalent of a whitewashed tomb looks like.  Thousands associate the cassock with being raped as kids by pedophile priests.  Most of these monsters still don the cassock as well.
Sorry to be such a downer, but the RCC is not dealing with this problem.  It's still happening and your pope is granting clemency.
In my mind the cassock may as well be a millstone.
It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin.

<TEXT> I don't think Jesus was excluding the NT from what He was talking about at all.  He was a Prophet and he dictated Revelations to John with specific instructions to write it down, so that invalidates the second part of your argument as well.  A good portion of the target audience was illiterate.  Also, a jot and tittle are things you WRITE, not say.

You've not yet answered my question.  If you don't trust scripture, then what do you trust.  Your processing power?  Your  study?    Your traditions?  At some point faith comes into play-but those deceived by transsubstantiationist argument aren't putting their faith in the Bible-they are putting it in a tradition that isn't supported by a reasonable reading of the Word at all.  I know the early church history-the good and the bad.  The Holy Spirit guided the selection of canon.  Matt 5:18 definitely applies-at the very least in principle-but as I stated above, I think specifically as well.  Jesus was not surprised by the NT at all-in fact he capped it off with Revelations Himself! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The canon was dictated by the Holy Spirit and the Word was guarded and kept by the Holy Spirit as well.  Jesus confirmed and amplified this in Matthew 5:18.

Scripture frequently refers to itself as "the word"-The sower sows the word.

I'm saying that Jesus was using symbolism.  It is obvious in the text.  The very ritual He was enacting with His disciples that BECAME communion is itself deeply symbolic and served as a memorial to a prior event.  He said "do this in remembrance " as they broke the bread.  
I don't want to make you cry, but a large portion of the Protestant or Reformed Church do not believe the heresy of transsubstantiation, so, being gracious to you I'll just pretend you weren't trying to deceive anyone with the first part of your post.

And finally, if you are simply admitting that the Bible doesn't support praying to Saints, then you're right!  Finally...
If what you're implying is that the Bible has nothing to say about who ONLY we should pray to them you're wrong! </TEXT>

Because God said it was-right here.

"You have heard that it was said, You shall not commit adultery. But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

<TEXT> What a strange argument you are making.  I think what you are saying is that in the OT/OC and NT/NC repentance was always the way to forgiveness-and if that's your point then I agree.  My point is that that without the shedding of blood there is NO forgives of sin (Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.
Hebrews 9:22 ESV) and that we can rejoice that Jesus shed His for our sins.

I have no wish to argue, and of course there were all manner of sacrifices proscribed in the OT/OC (propitiation, dedication, expiation), but I firmly disagree that "sacrifices were never necessary", as you say.  They were very necessary to tutor our stubborn hearts to the seriousness of sin, and to enlighten us as to God's plan for redemption.


And you shall offer one male goat for a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old as a sacrifice of peace offerings.
Leviticus 23:19 ESV

Go and learn what this means, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice. For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.
Matthew 9:13 ESV

For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself is beset with weakness. Because of this he is obligated to offer sacrifice for his own sins just as he does for those of the people.
Hebrews 5:1-3 ESV


And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God,
Hebrews 10:11-12 ESV

<TEXT> Look in the OT and tally up all the sins that justify the death penalty-you'll be amazed!  The Old Covenant covers over sin with the blood of an animal-hence the sacrifices constantly being made at the Tabernacle, then the Temple.  There are literally millennia of rivers of blood in the OT pointing to the seriousness of sin.  
When Jesus came, all of those pictures of blood covering sin were fulfilled in the blood of God paying the debt and guilt accrued by sin.  His sacrifice actually cancelled the debt-the Lamb paid it-it wasn't covered over until the next time-He took the punishment for it!

Praise God!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok-I'll give you a brief sketch.  Central Americans were fleeing governments torn up by revolution.  They would get to the Southwest and seek asylum in local Churches.  They would go through legal channels to be granted asylum status, as they would likely be killed by the military or corrupt police forces back home, but be denied asylum because our government was allied with their corrupt government to limit the Cold War influence of the USSR.  So, they would be sent back and killed or "disappeared".  The Church on the border defied the government and provided safety, resources, and legal counsel.
That could never happen today, right?
Our pastor made a point about hospitality last week, not directly in regards to immigrants-"truth is added to welcome".  I think it does apply. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Gifts are meant for the edification of the body-so of course we should humbly submit to teaching and instruction.  The Spirit also grants a Gift called "discerning of spirits"-which trumps a PhD.  I resist the term "experts"- it implies that someone has reached an end, has grasped and mastered a subject.  The Bible will not be fully grasped our mastered by anyone in their natural lifespan.  It grasps and masters you!

Teaching within the Church is more of a Shepherding experience-it is best accomplished in intimate relationships over time.  It is not a didactic experience, it is not  a TED talk, or a podcast.  It is walking together and disciplining.

Jesus's point is that the Kingdom is granted to the non-experts (the experts were the ones calling him a demon-possessed bastard and trying to kill him), the simple, the unlikely, the children.  We should be encouraging MORE Bible reading-more questions-more individual study, and more small group study of the Bible for everyone.  Not discouraging it by implying people are ignorant.  We want them to dive in and be grasped and mastered by the Word, right? </TEXT>

At that time Jesus declared, I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children;

<TEXT> He made fun sexual acts NOT a sin too.  

What you need to realize is that marriage and sex are awesome, AND are pictures that point to greater truths about Christ and the Church.  

Just looking at your most recent posts, you seem to be very young, involved in a lot of internet pornography, and no almost zero about mutually gratifying, God-glorifying sex.  Sex is designed for the marriage bed.  What you are seeing on the screen is called perversion and is really about domination and power.  Christ could dominate the Church, but He doesn't.  He's gentle and lowly of spirit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Christ is humble Trump is not.  Christ is meek Trump is not.  Christ is loving Trump is not.  Christ sacrificed Trump does not. Christ is welcoming Trump is not. Christ was poor Trump is rich.  Christ is self-controlled Trump lacks anything resembling self-control.  Christ is the Truth Trump is a liar. Christ is faithful Trump is a serial adulterer and admitted sexual assaulter.  Christ points to the Father Trump points to himself.  Christ wants unity Trump revels in division. Christ divested himself of power Trump grasps for more and more power. Christ protects the weak Trump exploits them. Christ healed the sick and Trump makes us all sick.
You are going to say , "Well yeah, no one looks good compared to Christ!"  And I will agree with you, no one is perfect, that's why He came.  However, for someone who claims to be a Christian (he eats his little cracker and drinks his little juice, he tries to not get God involved and has never repented) he shows zero Christian virtue (at the age of 70, I might add).  His administration has already coined the term "alternative facts" and made up on the fly several massacres that never happened!

Just a caution-I'm sure unnecessary in your case-but this line of interest can easily become a distraction from the real Mission.  Don't classify it as time in the Word or as your Bible Study because it's focus is not on God, but on our enemy.  I guess what I'm saying is that this type of study takes away from your real study.  Focus on God and that's where your real power will come from. </TEXT>

I will say that the churches that bear with and are gracious are closer to the heart of Christ (Eph 4), and those that value the Word and teach it are closer as well.

<TEXT> I think that Payne's work, even though he never even mentions Duke, has pushed the GBI into committing to an arrest and prosecution where they otherwise might have just let the status quo ride.  Maybe it resulted in new information being given to them, maybe it simply forces the to look again at what they already had, maybe it was bringing heat on them indirectly in that some members of law enforcement were suspects and were pushing people behind the scenes to clear them due to the added attention.  
What is very clear is that UAV has been a real catalyst to getting this thing solved.  Good job Payne! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Relationship with God is what we were designed for.  Every person in every society in every time  needs to be connected with God their maker.  He programmed this need into each of us.
Some people's relationship with Him is petulant rejection and pride( Atheists),  some people's relationship is grasping and searching, but rejecting the Way ( pagans-as a descriptor, not a pejorative), and a few peoples relationship is as children of God; those elected, called, Justified, Sanctified, and ultimately Glorified (Christians).

<TEXT> This is going to be kind of strange-Graham is going to see this as persecution of him for sharing the Gospel ( although clearly it is a renunciation of his political and policy stances), and this will likely cement his status as the martyr in his own mind and encourage the Trump Christians (should be an oxymoron) to just entrench.
I think a more effective strategy than just silencing him would be to publicly challenge his views-make him justify himself from scripture and if he can't, then he is discredited.  Ultimately, I hope he will repent of his associating the Church with this godless leader, Trump. </TEXT>

Marriage is NOT for the faint of heart-but don't let anyone despise your youth either.  These long-term engagements are a terrible idea.  Do you think you are getting "more spiritual" by practicing abstinence?  If you are going to be abstinent then you should not be dating.  YOU know and I know that before long you'll be cuddling, then touching, then the "abstinence" you've been practicing is all done and you both feel ashamed, she develops an eating disorder.., whatever.  If you love her marry her, if you don't then don't be a weak bastard and keep having sex with her because you are selfish. </TEXT>

You wise-sounding advice is in direct contradiction to the Apostle Paul in 1 Corin 7.  Also, what age was Mary when God thought her old enough to be married?  You are simply parroting social constructs, reinforcing modern thoughts on sexuality, and promulgating the excuse most young couples use to cohabitation, establish "sexual compatibility" by being promiscuous, and generally avoid growing up until they are in their 30s.
Sex is wonderful!  It's meant to be enjoyed while you are young!  Trust God in that He will make the marriage if much is made of Him in the marriage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's way simpler than you imagine.  THe hurdles you mention are ones you cling to because you use them to protect you from committing to a course of action.  "Not in a good place" is code for not having any money.  I'll tell you a secret-it's way more fun being poor every day with some you love, going to bed and making love, taking showers together in your tiny apartments bathroom, rejoicing over making the rent, deciding which used furniture to buy off of Craigslist than masturbating and semi-repenting in your parents basement.

Given your timidity, let me predict how this will go:
-you will date for awhile, fall in and out of bed with one another, resent each other, grow distant, break up and move on 
-you will have a tepid relationship with God over this period because you refuse to obey, but you are too scared to really turn your back and walk in "real" sin-in a word, you resign yourself to being lukewarm 

My advice is to commit-to be a man, to trust in God, to move forward into an adventure together.  

Just some advice from a total stranger. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am seeing the entire story that the verse is a part of.

Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.
Matthew 10:29-31 ESV

The principle in both of these texts is the same.  God knows everything that will happen, has a purpose and a plan for you personally and specifically, and you are invincible and have nothing to fear because you will accomplish His plan for you.  That was what God was telling Paul on the way to Rome.  The Jewish plot could not succeed because Gods plan was different. </TEXT>

I am saying that Christians won't die until they have completed Gods purpose for their life.  That is the EXACT application of that verse.

<TEXT> Most Jehovahs Witnesses are wonderful, kind, sincere people.  They are usually generous and warm and very friendly.  However, they are a false church because they do teach salvation by works, not by trusting in the work if Jesus Christ alone.  Their Gospel cannot save.
If I were you I would avoid studying with them.  I would find a small, Protestant church that believes in expository preaching and study the Bible with them.  Trust that the Holy Spirit will make any time you spend reading Gods Word worth it.  I would also recommend Wayne Grudem's Systematic Theology as a reference for all the questions you will have.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have 3 ( soon to be 4).  Memory verses are essential.  We do read the stories in the Bible from the Jesus Story Book Bible, but will also read from a couple other Children's Bibles with pictures.  The point there is to paint the big themes, present Jesus, explain who He is and why He came.  
Then we select verses that are important for kids to know. Gen  1:1, John 3:16, Eph 6:1, etc.  We try to use the FighterVerses app, Seeds of Praise Songs (on RightNowMedia if you have a Roku), memorizing the books of the Bible.  We actually have a dry-erase board close to our dinner table and at the end of dinner just go through the verse a couple of times.  Kids brains are amazing.
I have friends who are musical who have family praise night-they pick some praise songs and everyone goes at it with their own instruments.  I can sing-so Zi will usually just pick a fun praise song and start singing it to the 1 year old, clap her hands with her, and the 2 and 6 year old don't want to be left out so they join in without any promoting.
I would encourage you that NO ONE has it all together.  It's very important that you are unified with your spouse on what you are going to do.  Do it once a week or 5 times a week-it doesn't matter so much.   What matters is that they see that Christ has a special place in your heart.  I would always say prayers with them every night.  I would model repentance to them in your interactions with them and with your spouse.  I would pray that God would grant them the gift of repentance and faith.  It's His to give!

Just a lot of random advice from a complete stranger! </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, you're wrong.  You are injecting what you want to hear into the text.  Ex 22  16-17 and Deuteronomy 22: 13-21 both indicate that premarital sex was viewed as wrong in the OT.  Penalties ranged from financial to corporal to death-depending in the exact circumstances.  If it was totally fine then  why any penalty at all?
You're avoiding answering the single, simple, unifying question: what did Jesus mean in the Sermon on the Mount when He forbade lust?  I would assume you would consider His words as binding.  He is saying that lust is sinful.  I don't see how you get to premarital sex without lust-it is, in fact, the culmination of it.  
Finally, you saying porn is okay is also dead wrong, given Christ's forbidding that we lust.
You are essential embracing a libertarian view of sin-"as long as no one is hurt it's okay", while rejecting that God established absolutes and that when we reject those we are rebelling and offending Him-even if You and God are the only ones who know.

I hope you are not teaching your twisted, destructive view.  If you are I hope God forgives you, but I pray He makes an example of you to refute what you are teaching and protect the integrity of His Word.  Jesus said it would be better for you to have a millstone around your neck and be cast into the sea than for you to lead His young impressionable lambs astray-pretty strong words! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd be interested to hear your definition of lust, then.
In regards to two married people, there is clear direction in the epistles to have regular, frequent, unhindered sex within the confines of marriage.  So Jesus isn't talking about that.

Here's some more scripture since Jesus's clear directive isn't sufficient for you.

Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral (GREEK PORNEA) nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.   1 Corinthians 6:9-10

Now concerning the matters about which you wrote: It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman. But because of the temptation to sexual immorality (GREEK PORNEA), each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband. For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. Now as a concession, not a command, I say this. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has his own gift from God, one of one kind and one of another. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single as I am. But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.
1 Corinthians 7:1-9

The argument is very clear here.  The Greek word PORNEA does not just refer to sex in a pagan temple, but any sex outside of marriage.  Verse 9 further reinforces this reading-"if they cannot exercise self control they should marry".  

Your argument is heretical.  Stop telling young Christians it's okay to have premarital sex.  Their own consciences are offended and that ought to be a pretty good indication it's wrong even if they listen to your serpent's whispering. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have heard that it was said, You shall not commit adultery. But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.
Matthew 5:27-30

1 Corinth 6:13

<TEXT> Wow-your response is "go ahead, have sex outside of marriage-just get good birth control"?  Did you ever read the Sermon on the Mount?  You should not offer people advice.

Your advice has a familiar ring...

Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, Did God actually say, You shall not eat of any tree in the garden?

But the serpent said to the woman, You will not surely die. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.
Genesis 3:1, 4-5 ESV

I agree that Evangelical's reaction to Trump has been revelatory or apocalyptic to me as well.  It is a moment of crisis-an unmasking.  It's so interesting that this callow demagogue could unhinge this part of the church so easily! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Where would the threshing floor David purchased from the Jebusite have been?  The City of David, which is called Zion.  There were 2 600ft walkways leading DOWN from Ft Antonia to the Temple compound, according to Josephus who actually was there.  There is no down if the Temple was on the " Temple Mount"-only if the Fort was and the Temple was in the City
 of David, over the Ophel.
I honestly don't care if I convince you at all- if I'm right it will come out in time.  If you're right you'll never get to rebuild your Temple.  It only interests me how such a historically pivotal place has been misplaced by about 1000 meters! </TEXT>

Actually socialize with you church, your friends-go ice skating, register for a class doing something you've never done.  Cook something.  Go to the library and pick up a book and just sit down, read it until you don't feel like reading it any more, then put it back.

<TEXT> Well-logic would suggest that the allegations are brought to the clergy in sort form or fashion.  If they are brought to the police first, then they aren't what we are talking about here.  
When the allegation is brought, I would assume some sort of internal investigation (more or less thorough, depending on a lot of factors) is undertaken within the parrish.  The matter is settled in a quiet way.  These occurances all have some sort of paper trail-letters, transcripts of interviews, legal council, records of settlement and monetary payout.  All of this stuff leaves a trail of some sort.  The Boston Parrish under C. Law had much more explicit and thorough documentation of hundreds of sexual predators STILL in the clergy, for example.
When an allegation is made within a Parrish-the legal authorities should be notified IMMEDIATELY and all internal records regarding the incident made available to them.  This is the very LEAST that would be done in any other setting-say like in a daycare or public school if the same thing were to occur.
Since you seem to be the main RC on this sub standing in the smoke and saying " no fire, nothing to see here", why don't you inform us of what the actual protocol is in these instances.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like the organizations official ( to say nothing of knee-jerk) reaction is self-protective and self-serving:the opposite of Christian in other words.  Do you agree?
The priests that commit these atrocities don't lose their salvation, they don't lose their membership in the True Church, but they are deservedly hated and shunned.  The only way to minister to the predator priests is to force them to face the law first-then be cared for by the brothers.  The RC Church has that order exactly reversed. </TEXT>

It is a MASSIVE issue.   Predator priests are destroying, consuming the most defenseless lambs in the flock.  Bishops are covering up-no definitive change looks to be forthcoming.  Where are the shepherds willing to lay down their lives for the sheep?  Shepherds had staffs for a reason-to kill the wolves.  Instead of a mark of moral courage the collar may as well be a millstone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's weird that such a question generating a response from a Christian on a sub called r/Christianity would generate that sort of condescending psychoanalysis.  
My answer is:
1.  What I think is true
2.  Also supported by a good bit of archaeology and contemporary writings
3.  Definitely NOT anti-Semitic:  if Herrod's temple stood in the City of David, then Israel could rebuild whenever it liked
4.  Not mean-spirited in the least.  I assume the OP wanted some warm, tingly answer expressing awe at the foundation stone's antiquity and the extreme level of devotion and sincerity expressed there by the Orthodox daily.  
Sincerity doesn't guarantee accuracy-otherwise we would all have to admit that Mohammed landed on the "Temple Mount" on a flying horse.   
I believed Jesus when He said "not one stone".    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not really.  I actually think it is the lower layer of the Roman Fort and not the foundation of the Second Temple.  The Second Temple was built in the City of David on Mt Zion near ( or possibly over) the Gihon Spring.  This is located about 1000m south of the Temple Mount in the City of David.  Springs do not move.
Jesus said not a single stone would be left atop another of the Second Temple and Josephus places the Second Temple lower vertically than Fort Antonia-so the fort was on what has since been renamed the Temple Mount and the Wailing Wall is one of the foundation stones of that fort. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's best to just go back and read each instance.  I doubt the angel who destroyed the Egyptian first-born was just some "dude".  I doubt the angel who guards the way to the tree of life is just some dude (he'd be a very old dude by now).  I doubt the Angel armies whom the prophets servant couldn't see we're just delivering a message.  I doubt the Angels who contended against Gabriel to keep him from Daniel were just some dudes.  I don't think the shepherds were confused by what they saw.  I think Peter spoke to a supernatural being in jail.
If you take he view that the Bible is the true, inspired Word of God, kept by the Spirit of God, and meant to be read as such then things make sense-reality comes into focus.  If you take the view that it's some cobbled-together bastardization of older stories and helpful wisdom, then your life will be one long, frustrating cloud of doubt and questions.
Just read it until it reads you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mmmmkay-your first source is the Wikipedia page about Sodom and Gomorrah which confirms the accuracy of the site I referenced-it actually references right to the article you disparaged.  Strong research skills there.

The second link in your reply links to some discussion forum from 2011-my article is from 2015.  Again-pretty lazy and sloppy.

Your third reference is run by a foundation that has a person named " FuzzyCatPotato" on its board-very slick.

As to your last comment, a more careful reading of my last paragraph clarifies that we aren't even in disagreement there.  Take a deep breath fella.

<TEXT> In America,  where our leaders are ELECTED, and speaking your conscience is the patriotic thing to do, then speaking out against a terrible leader IS submitting to our governing authorities.  What Christian Trump supporters ( I cringe to even type that oxymoron) do not understand is that the authority in our system is the ideals laid out in the Constitution that the President HIMSELF swears to uphold-so the authority is NOT the man, but the Republic as envisioned in the ideals of the Constitution.

Therefore-by speaking out against a bad leader who tramples/perverts/misinterprets the principles of our Republic, I AM submitting.  We don't elect a King or Caesar for 4 years-we elect a President who is bound to a limited role as the administrator of 1/3 of our government and is limited by checks and balances.

By their  logic we should all submit to Roe v Wade, right?  It's the law.  If I can't speak out against Trump because it's not submissive then they can't speak out against Roe v Wade because it's not submissive.  We can and SHOULD speak out against both. </TEXT>

It actually happened and is documented (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.breakingisraelnews.com/51870/sodom-found-archaeological-evidence-proof-biblical-account-health-and-science/amp/?client=safari)

Feel free to ignore science and archaeology because it doesn't fit your ego-centric Godless world view.

Homosexuality is wrong, but I, for one, do not think it should be outlawed nor should homosexuals be persecuted or marginalized.  Jesus loves homosexuals as much as He loves me!  Jesus doesn't force Himself in anyone and neither should the Church.  We have to submit to what the Bible actually teaches, though.  We don't judge it, it judges us. </TEXT>

My question-poorly stated, I suppose-is will Trump follow through on that or will he do so only if Christians stick with him?  Will it be principle, pragmatism, or will he simply forget he ever mentioned it.
He could also just dangle it out in front of churches while he abuses those he doesn't like and hope it keeps us quiet... </TEXT>

The true Church is going to have to rise up and will likely be hotly persecuted-not by the non-Christians, but by the so-called Christians who've aligned themselves with this demagogue.

<TEXT> A funeral is not for the deceased-they don't care what's happening.  It's for the family remaining to say goodbye.  Why would the family force the atheist son to read something he doesn't believe?  That's just wrong.  Let him read something that is meaningful to him-some Thoreaux or whatever.  It's selfish because it's disregarding the sons feelings to please the rest of the clan.  They are acting selfishly.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> You've wasted a lot if time and energy responding to what you think I've said rather than what I've said.  You've still not even refuted what I sent earlier!
Mary IS blessed, she IS special, she IS the mother of Our Lord.  But the devotion you posted and praised as so " POWERFUL" is a collection of prayers TO Mary.  We cannot pray to Mary.  There's no scriptural mechanism that guarantees she CAN even hear a prayer directed at her.  We may as well pray to David or Moses or Noah.  
Again, just like God's problem was not with gold, but what the idolatrous Israelites made with the gold at the foot of Sinai, so  His problem is not with Mary, but with what YOUR idolatrous hearts have made of her!  
You've misapplied the verse you cited.  In Revelation the woman is Israel, not Mary personally, as implied by the 12 stars for the 12 tribes.  "But Mary is literally the one who birthed Christ" you will bleat.  If it were meant to be literal then she would have a gigantic ball of fire wrapping her and she would be standing in the moon!  Revelations is mysterious and you apply it literally by your pet theories at your peril.  
My eyes are neither veiled nor scaled in regards to the scriptures' portrayal of Mary.  You would be best served and God most honored if you would reserve your devotion and prayers for Him, and not His creature. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know the verse I cited was not referencing Jesus's refusal to see his mother.  I just assumed you would be able to find it.  It was illustrating his direct words to his disciples regarding prayer, which is the central issue we are discussing.   He never tells us to pray to Mary or pray TO anyone else-this is a Roman innovation.
You are misapplying the verses from John 8:41-44.  The Pharisees ARE insulting his lineage and essentially calling him a bastard (in the classic sense), but his response is talking about freedom from man-made traditions (v36), not defending his mother.
Marian devotion has the most tenuous biblical support (I would say zero support), Mr. Smith.  It is a Roman tradition and an outshoot of amalgamating true Christianity with pagan mother-God worship to make
It more palatable to new converts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When are we going to hear from more of the principle players?  I'd like to hear an interview with the principal, the elderly neighbors, the ex boyfriend, the ex boyfriend's mom.  I'd like to hear from the 18 year old she got dumped for.  I'd like to hear from the guy that left the card in her door.  I'd like to know if anyone has any pictures from the barbecue (the principal, Troy, might)-that way we could see if she was actually wearing the necklace they found pieces of at her house.  I'd like to hear from the old drug store owner with the unique car.  I'd like a list of all the guys she was sleeping with (it might be long).  I realize the GBI probably has a lot of this already.  That's my Christmas wish list.  So interesting! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Blue glove and position if Tara's car seat </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, the fact that her car seat was pushed way back and her keys, phone, wallet, etc were all locked in the house leads me to believe that someone took her car back from where they dumped her body, put all her stuff back in the house, locked the door behind them, then accidentally dropped the blue glove in the pine straw.  What that also suggests is that whoever did that had to be picked up by someone and driven back wherever.  So, at least 2 people.  My money is in the boyfriend and his cop friend (blue glove). </TEXT>
