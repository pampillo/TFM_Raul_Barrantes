<TEXT> Keep in mind that ENSO is also just an exchange of energy between the atmosphere and the oceans, yet it too has a global reach. It sounds like you're confusing the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) with the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), where the PDO is a measure between the east and west Pacific ocean poleward of 20N, the IPO is measure between the Southern and Northern hemispheres, significantly 50S to 50N. Note: 

PDO: During a warm phase (+), the west Pacific, poleward of 20N, becomes cooler and part of the eastern ocean warms; during a cool phase (-), the opposite pattern occurs.

IPO: During positive phases, ocean temperatures are warmer in the tropical Pacific, but cooler than average in the north Pacific. During negative phases of the IPO, Pacific Ocean temperatures are cooler than average in the tropical regions and warmer than average in the northern regions.  The IPO is similar to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in terms of sea temperature changes, but affects ocean waters south of 20N Latitude, which the PDO does not.

The following graphic shows a strong correlation between average global temperature and phases of the IPO: [graphic](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C_cM7dUVYAAiHVq.jpg) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Trajectories toward the 1.5C Paris target: Modulation by the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL073480/full)
___

**Abstract**

Global temperature is rapidly approaching the 1.5C Paris target. In the absence of external cooling influences, such as volcanic eruptions, temperature projections are centered on a breaching of the 1.5C target, relative to 18501900, before 2029. The phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) will regulate the rate at which mean temperature approaches the 1.5C level. A transition to the positive phase of the IPO would lead to a projected exceedance of the target centered around 2026. If the Pacific Ocean remains in its negative decadal phase, the target will be reached around 5 years later, in 2031. Given the temporary slowdown in global warming between 2000 and 2014, and recent initialized decadal predictions suggestive of a turnaround in the IPO, a sustained period of rapid temperature rise might be underway. In that case, the world will reach the 1.5C level of warming several years sooner than if the negative IPO phase persists.

**Plain Language Summary**

Global temperature is rapidly approaching the 1.5C Paris target. In this study, we find that in the absence of external cooling influences, such as volcanic eruptions, the midpoint of the spread of temperature projections exceeds the 1.5C target before 2029, based on temperatures relative to 18501900. We find that the phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), a slow-moving natural oscillation in the climate system, will regulate the rate at which global temperature approaches the 1.5C level. A transition to the positive phase of the IPO would lead to a projected exceedance of the target centered around 2026. If the Pacific Ocean remains in its negative phase, however, the projections are centered on reaching the target around 5 years later, in 2031. Given the temporary slowdown in global warming between 2000 and 2014, and recent climate model predictions suggestive of a turnaround in the IPO, a sustained period of rapid temperature rise might be underway. In that case, the world will reach the 1.5C level of warming several years sooner than if the negative IPO phase persists.

<TEXT> Minor technicality. Sea ice *does* contribute to sea level rise (different density between fresh water and salt water resulting from brine rejection during formation of the sea ice), it's just that the contribution is so minuscule it's effectively negligible. As the sea ice melts (fresh water) it lowers the salinity, which lowers the density and therefore increases the volume. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sharing this to point out that in 1975, 32 years prior to the IPCC's 4^(th) assessment report (published in 2007 - which also finds an [ECS of 3C](https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/tssts-6-4-2.html)) Manabe and Wetherald had arrived at a climate sensitivity of +2.93C in their GCM ([table 1](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0469%281975%29032%3C0003%3ATEODTC%3E2.0.CO%3B2))(pdf). Ten years on from the IPCC's AR4, another recent study still finds [ECS to be 2.9C](https://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v7/n5/full/nclimate3278.html).

I'd be interested in hearing why 'lukewarmers' have opted for lower end values, and why 'alarmists' have opted for higher end values. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Carbon dioxide sources from Alaska driven by increasing early winter respiration from Arctic tundra](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/05/02/1618567114)
___

**Significance**

Rising arctic temperatures could mobilize reservoirs of soil organic carbon trapped in permafrost. We present the first quantitative evidence for large, regional-scale early winter respiration flux, which more than offsets carbon uptake in summer in the Arctic. Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Barrow station indicate that October through December emissions of CO2 from surrounding tundra increased by 73% since 1975, supporting the view that rising temperatures have made Arctic ecosystems a net source of CO2. It has been known for over 50 y that tundra soils remain unfrozen and biologically active in early winter, yet many Earth System Models do not correctly represent this phenomenon or the associated CO2 emissions, and hence they underestimate current, and likely future, CO2 emissions under climate change.

**Abstract**

High-latitude ecosystems have the capacity to release large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere in response to increasing temperatures, representing a potentially significant positive feedback within the climate system. Here, we combine aircraft and tower observations of atmospheric CO2 with remote sensing data and meteorological products to derive temporally and spatially resolved year-round CO2 fluxes across Alaska during 20122014. We find that tundra ecosystems were a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere annually, with especially high rates of respiration during early winter (October through December). Long-term records at Barrow, AK, suggest that CO2 emission rates from North Slope tundra have increased during the October through December period by 73%  11% since 1975, and are correlated with rising summer temperatures. Together, these results imply increasing early winter respiration and net annual emission of CO2 in Alaska, in response to climate warming. Our results provide evidence that the decadal-scale increase in the amplitude of the CO2 seasonal cycle may be linked with increasing biogenic emissions in the Arctic, following the growing season. Early winter respiration was not well simulated by the Earth System Models used to forecast future carbon fluxes in recent climate assessments. Therefore, these assessments may underestimate the carbon release from Arctic soils in response to a warming climate.

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Neutralizing misinformation through inoculation: Exposing misleading argumentation techniques reduces their influence](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0175799)
___

**Abstract**

Misinformation can undermine a well-functioning democracy. For example, public misconceptions about climate change can lead to lowered acceptance of the reality of climate change and lowered support for mitigation policies. This study experimentally explored the impact of misinformation about climate change and tested several pre-emptive interventions designed to reduce the influence of misinformation. We found that false-balance media coverage (giving contrarian views equal voice with climate scientists) lowered perceived consensus overall, although the effect was greater among free-market supporters. Likewise, misinformation that confuses people about the level of scientific agreement regarding anthropogenic global warming (AGW) had a polarizing effect, with free-market supporters reducing their acceptance of AGW and those with low free-market support increasing their acceptance of AGW. However, we found that inoculating messages that (1) explain the flawed argumentation technique used in the misinformation or that (2) highlight the scientific consensus on climate change were effective in neutralizing those adverse effects of misinformation. We recommend that climate communication messages should take into account ways in which scientific content can be distorted, and include pre-emptive inoculation messages.

<TEXT> I think you're being misleading in your comment, as the 97% consensus claim has been effectively verified by multiple studies over the decades, see: [Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002)

Furthermore, there is no consensus among so-called 'skeptics.' Their position has morphed over time from outright denying that warming is occurring, to accepting warming is occurring but stating humans aren't contributing to the warming, to accepting human caused climate change but denying the amount of warming, to accepting the amount of warming but denying its potential impacts.

The problem is that there is no debate among scientists, but having a debate in media gives the illusions that the science *is* debated. This doesn't result from the scientific literature, it results from misinformation campaigns funding climate science denial, see for example: [Institutionalizing delay](http://drexel.edu/now/archive/2013/December/Climate-Change/).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Upper Ocean O2 trends: 1958-2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL073613/abstract)
___

**Abstract**

Historic observations of dissolved oxygen (O2) in the ocean are analyzed to quantify multi-decadal trends and variability from 1958 to 2015. Additional quality control is applied and the resultant oxygen anomaly field is used to quantify upper ocean O2 trends at global and hemispheric scales. A widespread negative O2 trend is beginning to emerge from the envelope of interannual variability. Ocean reanalysis data is used to evaluate relationships with changes in ocean heat content (OHC) and oxygen solubility (O2,sat). Global O2 decline is evident after the 1980s, accompanied by an increase in global OHC. The global upper ocean O2 inventory (0-1,000m) changed at the rate of -243124TmolO2 per decade. Further, the O2 inventory is negatively correlated with the OHC (r=-0.86; 0-1,000m) and the regression coefficient of O2 to OHC is approximately 8.20.66 nmol O2 J^1 , on the same order of magnitude as the simulated O2-heat relationship typically found in ocean climate models. Variability and trends in the observed upper ocean O2 concentration are dominated by the Apparent Oxygen Utilization (AOU) component with relatively small contributions from O2,sat. This indicates that changing ocean circulation, mixing and/or biochemical processes, rather than the direct thermally-induced solubility effects, are the primary drivers for the observed O2 changes. The spatial patterns of the multi-decadal trend include regions of enhanced ocean deoxygenation including the subpolar North Pacific, eastern boundary upwelling systems and tropical oxygen minimum zones. Further studies are warranted to understand and attribute the global O2 trends and their regional expressions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [The million-year evolution of the glacial trimline in the southernmost Ellsworth Mountains, Antarctica](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X17301851)
___

**Abstract**

An elevated erosional trimline in the heart of West Antarctica in the Ellsworth Mountains tells of thicker ice in the past and represents an important yet ambiguous stage in the evolution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Here we analyse the geomorphology of massifs in the southernmost Heritage Range where the surfaces associated with the trimline are overlain by surficial deposits that have the potential to be dated through cosmogenic nuclide analysis. Analysis of 100 rock samples reveals that some clasts have been exposed on glacially moulded surfaces for 1.4 Ma and perhaps more than 3.5 Ma, while others reflect fluctuations in thickness during Quaternary glacial cycles. Modelling the age of the glacially moulded bedrock surface based on cosmogenic 10Be, 26Al and 21Ne concentrations from a depth-profile indicates a minimum exposure age of 2.12.6 Ma. We conclude that the glacially eroded surfaces adjacent to the trimline predate the Last Glacial Maximum and indeed the Quaternary. Since erosion was by warm-based ice near an ice-sheet upper margin, we suggest it first occurred during the early glaciations of Antarctica before the stepped cooling of the mid-Miocene at 14 Ma. This was a time when the interior Antarctic continent had summers warm enough for tundra vegetation to grow and for mountain glaciers to consist of ice at the pressure melting point. During these milder conditions, and subsequently, erosion of glacial troughs is likely to have lowered the ice-sheet surface in relation to the mountains. This means that the range of orbitally induced cyclic fluctuations in ice thickness have progressively been confined to lower elevations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the article itself:

"Prior to this [the Mid Ordovician] the Earth was exposed to a prolonged super-greenhouse with sea surface temperatures estimated above 40 degree Celsius. Thus, seriously affecting the ability of life to evolve and diversify. The researchers therefore speculate that the sudden emergence of icehouse conditions brought about fundamental changes in ocean circulation, instigating thermohaline circulation in the oceans.

Today this thermohaline 'pump' has a fundamental importance with respect to bioproductivity in the oceans. Thus, back in the Ordovician, an initiation of this pump which circulates warm surface waters with cold bottom waters could have sparked a massive increase in bioproductivity thereby facilitating the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Onset of main Phanerozoic marine radiation sparked by emerging Mid Ordovician icehouse](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep18884)
___

**Abstract**

The Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE) was the most rapid and sustained increase in marine Phanerozoic biodiversity. What generated this biotic response across Palaeozoic seascapes is a matter of debate; several intrinsic and extrinsic drivers have been suggested. One is Ordovician climate, which in recent years has undergone a paradigm shift from a text-book example of an extended greenhouse to an interval with transient cooling intervals  at least during the Late Ordovician. Here, we show the first unambiguous evidence for a sudden Mid Ordovician icehouse, comparable in magnitude to the Quaternary glaciations. We further demonstrate the initiation of this icehouse to coincide with the onset of the GOBE. This finding is based on both abiotic and biotic proxies obtained from the most comprehensive geochemical and palaeobiological dataset yet collected through this interval. We argue that the icehouse conditions increased latitudinal and bathymetrical temperature and oxygen gradients initiating an Early Palaeozoic Great Ocean Conveyor Belt. This fuelled the GOBE, as upwelling zones created new ecospace for the primary producers. A subsequent rise in 13C ratios known as the Middle Darriwilian Isotopic Carbon Excursion (MDICE) may reflect a global response to increased bioproductivity encouraged by the onset of the GOBE. </TEXT>

What generated this biotic response across Palaeozoic seascapes is a matter of debate; several intrinsic and extrinsic drivers have been suggested. One is Ordovician climate, which in recent years has undergone a paradigm shift from a text-book example of an extended greenhouse to an interval with transient cooling intervals  at least during the Late Ordovician. Here, we show the first unambiguous evidence for a sudden Mid Ordovician icehouse, comparable in magnitude to the Quaternary glaciations. We further demonstrate the initiation of this icehouse to coincide with the onset of the GOBE. This finding is based on both abiotic and biotic proxies obtained from the most comprehensive geochemical and palaeobiological dataset yet collected through this interval. We argue that the icehouse conditions increased latitudinal and bathymetrical temperature and oxygen gradients initiating an Early Palaeozoic Great Ocean Conveyor Belt. This fuelled the GOBE, as upwelling zones created new ecospace for the primary producers. A subsequent rise in 13C ratios known as the Middle Darriwilian Isotopic Carbon Excursion (MDICE) may reflect a global response to increased bioproductivity encouraged by the onset of the GOBE. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Monitoring and Projecting Snow on Hawaii Island](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016EF000478/full)
___

**Abstract**

The highest mountain peaks on Hawaii Island are snow covered for part of almost every year. This snow has esthetic and recreational value as well as cultural significance for residents and visitors. Thus far there have been almost no systematic observations of snowfall, snow cover or snow depth in Hawaii. Here we use satellite observations to construct a daily index of Hawaii Island snow cover starting from 2000. The seasonal mean of our index displays large interannual variations that are correlated with the seasonal mean freezing level and frequency of trade wind inversions as determined from nearby balloon soundings. Our snow cover index provides a diagnostic for monitoring climate variability and trends within the extensive area of the globe dominated by the North Pacific trade wind meteorological regime.

We have also conducted simulations of the Hawaii climate with a regional atmospheric model. Retrospective simulations for 1990-2015 were run with boundary conditions prescribed from gridded observational analyses. Simulations for the end of 21st century employed boundary conditions based on global climate model projections that included standard scenarios for anticipated anthropogenic climate forcing. The future projections indicate that snowfall will nearly disappear by the end of the current century. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Measurement of the 13C isotopic signature of methane emissions from northern European wetlands](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GB005504/full)
___

**Abstract**

Isotopic data provide powerful constraints on regional and global methane emissions and their source profiles. However, inverse modeling of spatially resolved methane flux is currently constrained by a lack of information on the variability of source isotopic signatures. In this study, isotopic signatures of emissions in the Fennoscandian Arctic have been determined in chambers over wetland, in the air 0.3 to 3m above the wetland surface and by aircraft sampling from 100m above wetlands up to the stratosphere. Overall, the methane flux to atmosphere has a coherent 13C isotopic signature of 711, measured in situ on the ground in wetlands. This is in close agreement with 13C isotopic signatures of local and regional methane increments measured by aircraft campaigns flying through air masses containing elevated methane mole fractions. In contrast, results from wetlands in Canadian boreal forest farther south gave isotopic signatures of 671. Wetland emissions dominate the local methane source measured over the European Arctic in summer. Chamber measurements demonstrate a highly variable methane flux and isotopic signature, but the results from air sampling within wetland areas show that emissions mix rapidly immediately above the wetland surface and methane emissions reaching the wider atmosphere do indeed have strongly coherent C isotope signatures. The study suggests that for boreal wetlands (60N) global and regional modeling can use an isotopic signature of 71 to apportion sources more accurately, but there is much need for further measurements over other wetlands regions to verify this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Does It Matter if the Consensus on Anthropogenic Global Warming Is 97% or 99.99%?](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0270467617702781?journalCode=bsta )
___

**Abstract**

Cook et al. reported a 97% scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming (AGW), based on a study of 11,944 abstracts in peer-reviewed science journals. Powell claims that the Cook et al. methodology was flawed and that the true consensus is virtually unanimous at 99.99%. Powells method underestimates the level of disagreement because it relies on finding explicit rejection statements as well as the assumption that abstracts without a stated position endorse the consensus. Cook et al.s survey of the papers authors revealed that papers may express disagreement with AGW despite the absence of a rejection statement in the abstract. Surveys reveal a large gap between the public perception of the degree of scientific consensus on AGW and reality. We argue that it is the size of this gap, rather than the small difference between 97% and 99.99%, that matters in communicating the true state of scientific opinion to the public. </TEXT>

**Abstract**

Between about 1998 and 2012, a time that coincided with political negotiations for preventing climate change, the surface of Earth seemed hardly to warm. This phenomenon, often termed the global warming hiatus, caused doubt in the public mind about how well anthropogenic climate change and natural variability are understood. Here we show that apparently contradictory conclusions stem from different definitions of hiatus and from different datasets. A combination of changes in forcing, uptake of heat by the oceans, natural variability and incomplete observational coverage reconciles models and data. Combined with stronger recent warming trends in newer datasets, we are now more confident than ever that human influence is dominant in long-term warming. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Afforestation is a viable and widely practiced method of sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, because of a change in surface albedo, placement of less reflective forests can cause an increase in net-absorbed radiation and localized surface warming. This effect is enhanced in northern high latitudes where the presence of snow cover exacerbates the albedo difference. Regions where afforestation could provide a climate benefit are determined by comparing net ecosystem production and net radiation differences from afforestation in midlatitude and high latitude of North America. Using the dynamic vegetation model Integrated Biosphere Simulator, agricultural version (Agro-IBIS), we find a boundary through North America where afforestation results in a positive equivalent carbon balance (cooling) to the south, and a negative equivalent carbon balance (warming) to the north. Including the effects of stand age and fraction cover affect whether a site contributes to mitigating global warming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Temperature and rainfall interact to control carbon cycling in tropical forests](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12765/full)
___

**Abstract**

Tropical forests dominate global terrestrial carbon (C) exchange, and recent droughts in the Amazon Basin have contributed to short-term declines in terrestrial carbon dioxide uptake and storage. However, the effects of longer-term climate variability on tropical forest carbon dynamics are still not well understood. We synthesised field data from more than 150 tropical forest sites to explore how climate regulates tropical forest aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and organic matter decomposition, and combined those data with two existing databases to explore climate  C relationships globally. While previous analyses have focused on the effects of either temperature or rainfall on ANPP, our results highlight the importance of interactions between temperature and rainfall on the C cycle. In cool forests ( 20 C), high rainfall slowed rates of C cycling, but in warm tropical forests ( 20 C) it consistently enhanced both ANPP and decomposition. At the global scale, our analysis showed an increase in ANPP with rainfall in relatively warm sites, inconsistent with declines in ANPP with rainfall reported previously. Overall, our results alter our understanding of climate  C cycle relationships, with high precipitation accelerating rates of C exchange with the atmosphere in the most productive biome on earth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Holocene winter climate variability in Central and Eastern Europe](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-01397-w)
___

**Abstract**

Among abundant reconstructions of Holocene climate in Europe, only a handful has addressed winter conditions, and most of these are restricted in length and/or resolution. Here we present a record of late autumn through early winter air temperature and moisture source changes in East-Central Europe for the Holocene, based on stable isotopic analysis of an ice core recovered from a cave in the Romanian Carpathian Mountains. During the past 10,000 years, reconstructed temperature changes followed insolation, with a minimum in the early Holocene, followed by gradual and continuous increase towards the mid-to-late-Holocene peak (between 4-2kcal BP), and finally by a decrease after 0.8kcal BP towards a minimum during the Little Ice Age (AD 13001850). Reconstructed early Holocene atmospheric circulation patterns were similar to those characteristics of the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), while in the late Holocene they resembled those prevailing in the positive NAO phase. The transition between the two regimes occurred abruptly at around 4.7kcal BP. Remarkably, the widespread cooling at 8.2kcal BP is not seen very well as a temperature change, but as a shift in moisture source, suggesting weaker westerlies and increased Mediterranean cyclones penetrating northward at this time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [The extreme El Nio of 20152016 and the end of global warming hiatus](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL072908/abstract)
___

**Abstract**

Slower rates of increase in global mean surface temperature (GMST) after 2000, dubbed global warming hiatus, recently gave way to a rapid temperature rise. This rise coincided with persistent warm conditions in the equatorial Pacific between March 2014 and May 2016, which peaked as the 2015 extreme El Nio. Here we show that the El NioSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) tightly controls interannual variations in atmospheric heating rate in the tropics (r  0.9), allowing us to construct a simple, physically based model of GMST variations that incorporates greenhouse gas emissions, ENSO forcing, and stratospheric sulfate aerosols produced by volcanoes. The model closely reproduces GMST changes since 1880, including the global warming hiatus and the subsequent temperature rise. Our results confirm that weak El Nio activity, rather than volcanic eruptions, was the cause of the hiatus, while the rapid temperature rise is due to atmospheric heat release during 20142016 El Nio conditions concurrent with the continuing global warming trend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Mobile measurement of methane emissions from natural gas developments in Northeastern British Columbia, Canada](http://www.atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net/acp-2017-109/)
___

**Abstract**

North American leaders recently committed to reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, but information on current emissions from Canadian unconventional developments is lacking. This study examined the incidence of methane in an area of unconventional natural gas development in northwestern Canada. In August to September 2015 we completed almost 8000 km of vehicle-based survey campaigns on public roads dissecting developments that mainly access the Montney formation in northeastern British Columbia. Six survey routes were repeated 36 times and brought us past over 1600 unique well pads and facilities developed by more than 50 different operators. To attribute on-road plumes to infrastructural sources we used gas signatures of residual excess concentrations (anomalies above background) less than 500 m downwind from infrastructural sources. All results represent emissions greater than our minimum detection limit of 0.59 g/s at our average detection distance (319 m). Unlike many other developments in the US for which methane measurements have been reported recently, the methane concentrations we measured at surface were close to normal atmospheric levels, except inside natural gas plumes. Roughly 47 % of active wells emitted methane-rich plumes above our minimum detection limit. Abandoned and under-development well sites also emitted methane-rich plumes, but the incidence rate was below that of producing wells. Multiple sites that pre-date the recent unconventional Montney development were found to be emitting, and in general we observed that older infrastructure tended to emit more often (per unit) with comparable severity in terms of measured excess concentrations on-road. We also observed emissions from facilities of various types that were highly repeatable. Emission patterns in this area were best explained by infrastructure age and type. Extrapolating our results across the Montney development, we estimate that the emission sources we located (emitting at a rate  0.59 g/s) contribute more than 111,800 tonnes of methane annually to the atmosphere. This value exceeds reported bottom-up estimates of 78,000 tonnes for all oil and gas sector sources in British Columbia, of which the Montney represents about 55 % of production. The results also demonstrate that mobile surveys could be used to exhaustively screen developments for super-emitters, because without our intensive 6-fold replication we could have used single-pass sampling to screen 80 % of Montney-related infrastructure. This is the first bottom-up study of fugitive emissions in the Canadian energy sector, and these results can be used to inform policy development in an era of methane emission reduction efforts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [New estimate of the current rate of sea level rise from a sea level budget approach](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL073308/abstract)
___

**Abstract**

We revisit the global mean sea level (GMSL) budget during the whole altimetry era (January 1993 to December 2015) using a large number of data sets. The budget approach allows quantifying the TOPEX A altimeter drift (amounting 1.5  0.5 mm/yr over 19931998).

___

**Abstract**

We revisit the global mean sea level (GMSL) budget during the whole altimetry era (January 1993 to December 2015) using a large number of data sets. The budget approach allows quantifying the TOPEX A altimeter drift (amounting 1.5  0.5 mm/yr over 19931998). Accounting for this correction and using ensemble means for the GMSL and components lead to closure of the sea level budget (trend of the residual time series being 0.0  0.22 mm/yr). The new GMSL rate over January 1993 to December 2015 is now close to 3.0 mm/yr. An important increase of the GMSL rate, of 0.8 mm/yr, is found during the second half of the altimetry era (20042015) compared to the 19932004 time span, mostly due to Greenland mass loss increase and also to slight increase of all other components of the budget. </TEXT>

**Abstract**

Taylor Glacier hosts an active englacial hydrologic system that feeds Blood Falls, a supraglacial outflow of iron-rich subglacial brine at the terminus, despite mean annual air temperatures of 17C and limited surface melt. Taylor Glacier is an outlet glacier of the East Antarctic ice sheet that terminates in Lake Bonney, McMurdo Dry Valleys. To image and map the brine feeding Blood Falls, we used radio echo sounding to delineate a subhorizontal zone of englacial brine upstream from Blood Falls and elongated in the ice flow direction. We estimate volumetric brine content in excess of 13% within 2 m of the central axis of this zone, and likely much higher at its center. Brine content decreases, but remains detectable, up to 45 m away along some transects. Hence, we infer a network of subparallel basal crevasses allowing injection of pressurized subglacial brine into the ice. Subglacial brine is routed towards Blood Falls by hydraulic potential gradients associated with deeply incised supraglacial valleys. The brine remains liquid within the subglacial and englacial environments through latent heat of freezing coupled with elevated salt content. Our findings suggest that cold glaciers could support freshwater hydrologic systems through localized warming by latent heat alone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Large near-term projected snowpack loss over the western United States](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14996)
___

**Abstract**

Peak runoff in streams and rivers of the western United States is strongly influenced by melting of accumulated mountain snowpack. A significant decline in this resource has a direct connection to streamflow, with substantial economic and societal impacts. Observations and reanalyses indicate that between the 1980s and 2000s, there was a 1020% loss in the annual maximum amount of water contained in the regions snowpack. Here we show that this loss is consistent with results from a large ensemble of climate simulations forced with natural and anthropogenic changes, but is inconsistent with simulations forced by natural changes alone. A further loss of up to 60% is projected within the next 30 years. Uncertainties in loss estimates depend on the size and the rate of response to continued anthropogenic forcing and the magnitude and phasing of internal decadal variability. The projected losses have serious implications for the hydropower, municipal and agricultural sectors in the region. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Designing better methane mitigation policies: the challenge of distributed small sources in the natural gas sector](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa6791)
___

**Abstract**

Methanea short-lived and potent greenhouse gaspresents a unique challenge: it is emitted from a large number of highly distributed and diffuse sources. In this regard, the United States' Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recommended periodic leak detection and repair surveys at oil and gas facilities using optical gas imaging technology. This regulation requires an operator to fix all detected leaks within a set time period. Whether such 'find-all-fix-all' policies are effective depends on significant uncertainties in the character of emissions. In this work, we systematically analyze the effect of facility-related and mitigation-related uncertainties on regulation effectiveness. Drawing from multiple publicly-available datasets, we find that: (1) highly-skewed leak-size distributions strongly influence emissions reduction potential; (2) variations in emissions estimates across facilities leads to large variability in mitigation effectiveness; (3) emissions reductions from optical gas imaging-based leak detection programs can range from 15% to over 70%; and (4) while implementation costs are uniformly lower than EPA estimates, benefits from saved gas are highly variable. Combining empirical evidence with model results, we propose four policy options for effective methane mitigation: performance-oriented targets for accelerated emission reductions, flexible policy mechanisms to account for regional variation, technology-agnostic regulations to encourage adoption of the most cost-effective measures, and coordination with other greenhouse gas mitigation policies to reduce unintended spillover effects.

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Dominant 100,000-year precipitation cyclicity in a late Miocene lake from northeast Tibet](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/3/e1600762.full)
___

**Abstract**

East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) precipitation received by northern China over the past 800 thousand years (ky) is characterized by dominant 100-ky periodicity, mainly attributed to CO2 and Northern Hemisphere insolationdriven ice sheet forcing. We established an EASM record in the Late Miocene from lacustrine sediments in the Qaidam Basin, northern China, which appears to exhibit a dominant 100-ky periodicity similar to the EASM records during the Late Quaternary. Because evidence suggests that partial or ephemeral ice existed in the Northern Hemisphere during the Late Miocene, we attribute the 100-ky cycles to CO2 and Southern Hemisphere insolationdriven Antarctic ice sheet forcing. This indicates a 6million year earlier onset of the dominant 100-ky Asian monsoon and, likely, glacial and CO2 cycles and may indicate dominant forcing of Northern Hemisphere climate by CO2 and Southern Hemisphere ice sheets in a warm world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Temperature Decouples Ammonium and Nitrite Oxidation in Coastal Waters](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.6b03483)
___

**Abstract**

Nitrification is a two-step process linking the reduced and oxidized sides of the nitrogen cycle. These steps are typically tightly coupled with the primary intermediate, nitrite, rarely accumulating in coastal environments. Nitrite concentrations can exceed 10 M during summer in estuarine waters adjacent to Sapelo Island, Georgia, U.S.A. Similar peaks at other locations have been attributed to decoupling of the two steps of nitrification by hypoxia; however, the waters around Sapelo Island are aerobic and well-mixed. Experiments examining the response to temperature shifts of a nitrifying assemblage composed of the same organisms found in the field indicate that ammonia- and nitrite-oxidation become uncoupled between 20 and 30 C, leading to nitrite accumulation. This suggests that nitrite peaks in coastal waters might be explained by differences in the responses of ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizers to increased summer temperatures. Analysis of field data from 270 stations in 29 temperate and subtropical estuaries and lagoons show transient accumulation of nitrite driven primarily by water temperatures, rather than by hypoxia. Increased climate variability and warming coastal waters may therefore increase the frequency of these nitrite peaks, with potential ecosystem consequences that include increased N2O production, NO2^ toxicity, and shifts in phytoplankton community composition. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Such mass graves aren't created *during* the flood, or even from a single event, but rather result from tens of thousands of years of accumulating sediments that provide favorable conditions for the preservation of, geologically speaking, young organic material.

For example, a brief summary of the SnowMastadon site your refer to is as follows:

~130,000ka (?) the [Bull Lake glaciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_Lake_glaciation) was coming to an end. As conditions warmed (leading into the Sangamonian Stage), local glaciers receded, leaving a terminal moraine which impeded drainage of the glacial meltwater. This step generates a proglacial lake, filling with glacial outwash and fine wind blown sediments (loess) as the glaciers continue to recede. Moraines are relatively steep sided and unstable, and repeated slumps, and slides occurred over tens of thousands of years carrying with them organic rich material (ie. the local fauna). This process would repeat itself with the Pinedale Glaciation and subsequent warming, eventually filling with sediments, becoming a peat bog and meadow and its present condition. 

The mass grave at SnowMastadon contains a succession of unique fossil rich beds deposited over tens of thousands of years primarily from slope collapses into a lake environment that was favorable for the preservation of organic material. So while you are certainly correct in one sense, providing a mechanism of transport into the lake bottom through 'mud slides/rock slides' you were incorrect in another sense - the sense of scale. Glacial outburst floods resulting in Mwp 1a   b are nearly unfathomable, catastrophic events, while the events that occurred to give us such sites as the SnowMastadon site were far less spectacular, local (rather than regional) and were on much, much smaller scales. </TEXT>

Which mass animal graves are you referring to?

I would be skeptical of any claim that these events lead to the formation of mass animal graves of well preserved fauna. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Megafaunal isotopes reveal role of increased moisture on rangeland during late Pleistocene extinctions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0125)
___

**Abstract**

The role of environmental change in the late Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions remains a key question, owing in part to uncertainty about landscape changes at continental scales. We investigated the influence of environmental changes on megaherbivores using bone collagen nitrogen isotopes (n = 684, 63 new) as a proxy for moisture levels in the rangelands that sustained late Pleistocene grazers. An increase in landscape moisture in Europe, Siberia and the Americas during the Last GlacialInterglacial Transition (LGIT; ~2510 kyr bp) directly affected megaherbivore ecology on four continents, and was associated with a key period of population decline and extinction. In all regions, the period of greatest moisture coincided with regional deglaciation and preceded the widespread formation of wetland environments. Moisture-driven environmental changes appear to have played an important part in the late Quaternary megafaunal extinctions through alteration of environments such as rangelands, which supported a large biomass of specialist grazers. On a continental scale, LGIT moisture changes manifested differently according to regional climate and geography, and the stable presence of grasslands surrounding the central forested belt of Africa during this period helps to explain why proportionally fewer African megafauna became extinct during the late Pleistocene. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

In December 2015 in Paris, leaders committed to achieve global, net decarbonization of human activities before 2100. This achievement would halt and even reverse anthropogenic climate change through the net removal of carbon from the atmosphere. However, the Paris documents contain few specific prescriptions for emissions mitigation, leaving various countries to pursue their own agendas. In this analysis, we project energy and land-use emissions mitigation pathways through 2100, subject to best-available parameterization of carbon-climate feedbacks and interdependencies. We find that, barring unforeseen and transformative technological advancement, anthropogenic emissions need to peak within the next 10 years, to maintain realistic pathways to meeting the COP21 emissions and warming targets. Fossil fuel consumption will probably need to be reduced below a quarter of primary energy supply by 2100 and the allowable consumption rate drops even further if negative emissions technologies remain technologically or economically unfeasible at the global scale. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Widespread movement of meltwater onto and across Antarctic ice shelves](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v544/n7650/full/nature22049.html)
___

**Abstract**

Surface meltwater drains across ice sheets, forming melt ponds that can trigger ice-shelf collapse, acceleration of grounded ice flow and increased sea-level rise. Numerical models of the Antarctic Ice Sheet that incorporate meltwaters impact on ice shelves, but ignore the movement of water across the ice surface, predict a metre of global sea-level rise this century in response to atmospheric warming. To understand the impact of water moving across the ice surface a broad quantification of surface meltwater and its drainage is needed. Yet, despite extensive research in Greenland and observations of individual drainage systems in Antarctica, we have little understanding of Antarctic-wide surface hydrology or how it will evolve. Here we show widespread drainage of meltwater across the surface of the ice sheet through surface streams and ponds (hereafter surface drainage) as far south as 85 S and as high as 1,300 metres above sea level. Our findings are based on satellite imagery from 1973 onwards and aerial photography from 1947 onwards. Surface drainage has persisted for decades, transporting water up to 120 kilometres from grounded ice onto and across ice shelves, feeding vast melt ponds up to 80 kilometres long. Large-scale surface drainage could deliver water to areas of ice shelves vulnerable to collapse, as melt rates increase this century. While Antarctic surface melt ponds are relatively well documented on some ice shelves, we have discovered that ponds often form part of widespread, large-scale surface drainage systems. In a warming climate, enhanced surface drainage could accelerate future ice-mass loss from Antarctic, potentially via positive feedbacks between the extent of exposed rock, melting and thinning of the ice sheet.


Study: [Antarctic ice shelf potentially stabilized by export of meltwater in surface river](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v544/n7650/full/nature22048.html)
___

**Abstract**

Meltwater stored in ponds and crevasses can weaken and fracture ice shelves, triggering their rapid disintegration. This ice-shelf collapse results in an increased flux of ice from adjacent glaciers and ice streams, thereby raising sea level globally. However, surface rivers forming on ice shelves could potentially export stored meltwater and prevent its destructive effects. Here we present evidence for persistent active drainage networksinterconnected streams, ponds and riverson the Nansen Ice Shelf in Antarctica that export a large fraction of the ice shelfs meltwater into the ocean. We find that active drainage has exported water off the ice surface through waterfalls and dolines for more than a century. The surface river terminates in a 130-metre-wide waterfall that can export the entire annual surface melt over the course of seven days. During warmer melt seasons, these drainage networks adapt to changing environmental conditions by remaining active for longer and exporting more water. Similar networks are present on the ice shelf in front of Petermann Glacier, Greenland, but other systems, such as on the Larsen C and Amery Ice Shelves, retain surface water at present. The underlying reasons for export versus retention remain unclear. Nonetheless our results suggest that, in a future warming climate, surface rivers could export melt off the large ice shelves surrounding Antarcticacontrary to present Antarctic ice-sheet models, which assume that meltwater is stored on the ice surface where it triggers ice-shelf disintegration. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Migration induced by sea-level rise could reshape the US population landscape](https://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3271.html)
___

**Abstract**

Many sea-level rise (SLR) assessments focus on populations presently inhabiting vulnerable coastal communities, but to date no studies have attempted to model the destinations of these potentially displaced persons. With millions of potential future migrants in heavily populated coastal communities, SLR scholarship focusing solely on coastal communities characterizes SLR as primarily a coastal issue, obscuring the potential impacts in landlocked communities created by SLR-induced displacement. Here I address this issue by merging projected populations at risk of SLR with migration systems simulations to project future destinations of SLR migrants in the United States. I find that unmitigated SLR is expected to reshape the US population distribution, potentially stressing landlocked areas unprepared to accommodate this wave of coastal migrantseven after accounting for potential adaptation. These results provide the first glimpse of how climate change will reshape future population distributions and establish a new foundation for modelling potential migration destinations from climate stressors in an era of global environmental change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Ambiguity in the causes for decadal trends in atmospheric methane and hydroxyl](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/04/11/1616020114.full)
___

**Significance**

Recent trends in atmospheric methane are not well understood as evidenced by multiple hypotheses proposed to explain the stabilization of methane concentrations in the early 2000s and the renewed growth since 2007. Here we use a multispecies inversion to determine the cause of these decadal trends. The most likely explanation for the renewed growth in atmospheric methane involves a decrease in hydroxyl (OH), the main sink for atmospheric methane, that is partially offset by a decrease in methane emissions. However, we also demonstrate that the problem of attributing methane trends from the current surface observation network, including isotopes, is underdetermined and does not allow unambiguous attribution of decadal trends.
 
**Abstract**

Methane is the second strongest anthropogenic greenhouse gas and its atmospheric burden has more than doubled since 1850. Methane concentrations stabilized in the early 2000s and began increasing again in 2007. Neither the stabilization nor the recent growth are well understood, as evidenced by multiple competing hypotheses in recent literature. Here we use a multispecies two-box model inversion to jointly constrain 36 y of methane sources and sinks, using ground-based measurements of methane, methyl chloroform, and the C13/C12 ratio in atmospheric methane (13CH4) from 1983 through 2015. We find that the problem, as currently formulated, is underdetermined and solutions obtained in previous work are strongly dependent on prior assumptions. Based on our analysis, the mathematically most likely explanation for the renewed growth in atmospheric methane, counterintuitively, involves a 25-Tg/y decrease in methane emissions from 2003 to 2016 that is offset by a 7% decrease in global mean hydroxyl (OH) concentrations, the primary sink for atmospheric methane, over the same period. However, we are still able to fit the observations if we assume that OH concentrations are time invariant (as much of the previous work has assumed) and we then find solutions that are largely consistent with other proposed hypotheses for the renewed growth of atmospheric methane since 2007. We conclude that the current surface observing system does not allow unambiguous attribution of the decadal trends in methane without robust constraints on OH variability, which currently rely purely on methyl chloroform data and its uncertain emissions estimates. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Windscapes and olfactory foraging in a large carnivore](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46332)
___

**Abstract**

The theoretical optimal olfactory search strategy is to move cross-wind. Empirical evidence supporting wind-associated directionality among carnivores, however, is sparse. We examined satellite-linked telemetry movement data of adult female polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from Hudson Bay, Canada, in relation to modelled winds, in an effort to understand olfactory search for prey. In our results, the predicted cross-wind movement occurred most frequently at night during winter, the time when most hunting occurs, while downwind movement dominated during fast winds, which impede olfaction. Migration during sea ice freeze-up and break-up was also correlated with wind. A lack of orientation during summer, a period with few food resources, likely reflected reduced cross-wind search. Our findings represent the first quantitative description of anemotaxis, orientation to wind, for cross-wind search in a large carnivore. The methods are widely applicable to olfactory predators and their prey. We suggest windscapes be included as a habitat feature in habitat selection models for olfactory animals when evaluating what is considered available habitat. </TEXT>

**Abstract**

Global energy budget constraints suggest an equilibrium climate sensitivity around 2 C, which is lower than estimates from palaeoclimate reconstructions, process-based observational analyses, and global climate model simulations. A key assumption is that the climate sensitivity inferred today also applies to the distant future. Yet, global climate models robustly show that feedbacks vary over time, with a strong tendency for climate sensitivity to increase as equilibrium is approached. Here I consider the implications of inconstant climate feedbacks for energy budget constraints on climate sensitivity. I find that the long-term value of climate sensitivity is, on average, 26% above that inferred during transient warming within global climate models, with a larger discrepancy when climate sensitivity is high. Moreover, model values of climate sensitivity inferred during transient warming are found to be consistent with energy budget observations indicating that the models are not overly sensitive. Using model-based estimates of how climate feedbacks will change in the future, in conjunction with recent energy budget constraints produces a current best estimate of equilibrium climate sensitivity of 2.9 C (1.77.1 C, 90% confidence). These findings suggest that climate sensitivity estimated from global energy budget constraints is in agreement with values derived from other methods and simulated by global climate models. </TEXT>

**Abstract**

River piracythe diversion of the headwaters of one stream into another onecan dramatically change the routing of water and sediment, with a profound effect on landscape evolution. Stream piracy has been investigated in glacial environments, but so far it has mainly been studied over Quaternary or longer timescales. Here we document how retreat of Kaskawulsh Glacierone of Canadas largest glaciersabruptly and radically altered the regional drainage pattern in spring 2016. We use a combination of hydrological measurements and drone-generated digital elevation models to show that in late May 2016, meltwater from the glacier was re-routed from discharge in a northward direction into the Bering Sea, to southward into the Pacific Ocean. Based on satellite image analysis and a signal-to-noise ratio as a metric of glacier retreat, we conclude that this instance of river piracy was due to post-industrial climate change. Rapid regional drainage reorganizations of this type can have profound downstream impacts on ecosystems, sediment and carbon budgets, and downstream communities that rely on a stable and sustained discharge. We suggest that the planforms of Slims and Kaskawulsh rivers will adjust in response to altered flows, and the future Kaskawulsh watershed will extend into the now-abandoned headwaters of Slims River and eventually capture the Kluane Lake drainage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Future climate forcing potentially without precedent in the last 420 million years](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845)
___

**Abstract**

The evolution of Earths climate on geological timescales is largely driven by variations in the magnitude of total solar irradiance (TSI) and changes in the greenhouse gas content of the atmosphere. Here we show that the slow 50Wm2 increase in TSI over the last 420 million years (an increase of 9Wm2 of radiative forcing) was almost completely negated by a long-term decline in atmospheric CO2. This was likely due to the silicate weathering-negative feedback and the expansion of land plants that together ensured Earths long-term habitability. Humanitys fossil-fuel use, if unabated, risks taking us, by the middle of the twenty-first century, to values of CO2 not seen since the early Eocene (50 million years ago). If CO2 continues to rise further into the twenty-third century, then the associated large increase in radiative forcing, and how the Earth system would respond, would likely be without geological precedent in the last half a billion years. </TEXT>

**Abstract**

River piracythe diversion of the headwaters of one stream into another onecan dramatically change the routing of water and sediment, with a profound effect on landscape evolution. Stream piracy has been investigated in glacial environments, but so far it has mainly been studied over Quaternary or longer timescales. Here we document how retreat of Kaskawulsh Glacierone of Canadas largest glaciersabruptly and radically altered the regional drainage pattern in spring 2016. We use a combination of hydrological measurements and drone-generated digital elevation models to show that in late May 2016, meltwater from the glacier was re-routed from discharge in a northward direction into the Bering Sea, to southward into the Pacific Ocean. Based on satellite image analysis and a signal-to-noise ratio as a metric of glacier retreat, we conclude that this instance of river piracy was due to post-industrial climate change. Rapid regional drainage reorganizations of this type can have profound downstream impacts on ecosystems, sediment and carbon budgets, and downstream communities that rely on a stable and sustained discharge. We suggest that the planforms of Slims and Kaskawulsh rivers will adjust in response to altered flows, and the future Kaskawulsh watershed will extend into the now-abandoned headwaters of Slims River and eventually capture the Kluane Lake drainage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Sea surface pCO2 and O2 dynamics in the partially ice-covered Arctic Ocean](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JC012162/full)
___

**Abstract**

Understanding the physical and biogeochemical processes that control CO2 and dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics in the Arctic Ocean (AO) is crucial for predicting future air-sea CO2 fluxes and ocean acidification. Past studies have primarily been conducted on the AO continental shelves during low-ice periods and we lack information on gas dynamics in the deep AO basins where ice typically inhibits contact with the atmosphere. To study these gas dynamics, in situ time-series data have been collected in the Canada Basin during late summer to autumn of 2012. Partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), DO concentration, temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll-a fluorescence (Chl-a) were measured in the upper ocean in a range of sea ice states by two drifting instrument systems. Although the two systems were on average only 222 km apart, they experienced considerably different ice cover and external forcings during the 4050 day periods when data were collected. The pCO2 levels at both locations were well below atmospheric saturation whereas DO was almost always slightly supersaturated. Modeling results suggest that air-sea gas exchange, net community production (NCP), and horizontal gradients were the main sources of pCO2 and DO variability in the sparsely ice-covered AO. In areas more densely covered by sea ice, horizontal gradients were the dominant source of variability, with no significant NCP in the surface mixed layer. If the AO reaches equilibrium with atmospheric CO2 as ice cover continues to decrease, aragonite saturation will drop from a present mean of 1.000.02 to 0.860.01. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Direct observations of ice seasonality reveal changes in climate over the past 320570 years](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep25061)
___

**Abstract**

Lake and river ice seasonality (dates of ice freeze and breakup) responds sensitively to climatic change and variability. We analyzed climate-related changes using direct human observations of ice freeze dates (14432014) for Lake Suwa, Japan, and of ice breakup dates (16932013) for Torne River, Finland. We found a rich array of changes in ice seasonality of two inland waters from geographically distant regions: namely a shift towards later ice formation for Suwa and earlier spring melt for Torne, increasing frequencies of years with warm extremes, changing inter-annual variability, waning of dominant inter-decadal quasi-periodic dynamics, and stronger correlations of ice seasonality with atmospheric CO2 concentration and air temperature after the start of the Industrial Revolution. Although local factors, including human population growth, land use change, and water management influence Suwa and Torne, the general patterns of ice seasonality are similar for both systems, suggesting that global processes including climate change and variability are driving the long-term changes in ice seasonality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Extensive Early Cretaceous (Albian) methane seepage on Ellef Ringnes Island, Canadian High Arctic](http://gsabulletin.gsapubs.org/content/early/2017/04/07/B31601.1.abstract)
___

**Abstract**

During field mapping of Ellef Ringnes Island, Canadian Arctic Archipelago, 139 isolated Early Cretaceous methane seep deposits were found from 75 field sites. Stable isotopes of the carbonates have values of 13C = 47 to 35 and 18O = 4.0 to +0.7. Isoprenoids in organics from one of the seeps are significantly depleted in 13C, with the most negative 13C value of 118 and 113 for 2,6,10,15,19-pentamethylicosane (PMI) and phytane/crocetane, respectively. These values indicate an origin through methane oxidation, consistent with biomarkers that are characteristic for anaerobic methanotrophic archaea within the seep deposits, accompanied by terminally branched fatty acids showing similar 13C values (92) sourced from sulfate-reducing bacteria. The seep deposits contain a moderate-diversity macrofaunal assemblage comprising ammonites, bivalves, gastropods, scaphopods, vestimentiferan worm tubes, and brachiopods. The assemblage is dominated numerically by species that probably had chemosymbionts. The seep deposits formed in the subsurface within strong redox zones, in an otherwise normal marine setting, characterized by oxic waters at high paleolatitudes.

While geographically widespread over an area of 10,000 km^2 , seep deposits on Ellef Ringnes Island occur in a narrow stratigraphic horizon, suggesting a large release of biogenic methane occurred over a brief period of time. This gas release was coincident with a transition from a cold to warm climate during the latest early Albian, and we hypothesize that this may have been related to gas hydrate release. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [An observation-based constraint on permafrost loss as a function of global warming](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3262.html)
___

**Abstract**

Permafrost, which covers 15 million km2 of the land surface, is one of the components of the Earth system that is most sensitive to warming. Loss of permafrost would radically change high-latitude hydrology and biogeochemical cycling, and could therefore provide very significant feedbacks on climate change. The latest climate models all predict warming of high-latitude soils and thus thawing of permafrost under future climate change, but with widely varying magnitudes of permafrost thaw. Here we show that in each of the models, their present-day spatial distribution of permafrost and air temperature can be used to infer the sensitivity of permafrost to future global warming. Using the same approach for the observed permafrost distribution and air temperature, we estimate a sensitivity of permafrost area loss to global mean warming at stabilization of 4.0 (+1.0, -1.1) million km^2  C^1 (1 confidence), which is around 20% higher than previous studies. Our method facilitates an assessment for COP21 climate change targets: if the climate is stabilized at 2 C above pre-industrial levels, we estimate that the permafrost area would eventually be reduced by over 40%. Stabilizing at 1.5 C rather than 2 C would save approximately 2 million km^2 of permafrost. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [The transitional climate of the late Miocene Arctic: Winter-dominated precipitation with high seasonal variability](http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/early/2017/03/16/G38746.1.abstract)
___

**Abstract**

The late Miocene (11.65.3 Ma) was an important transitional period following the greenhouse conditions of the Eocene. In order to gain insight into the Arctic paleoclimate of the time, we performed high-resolution intraring 13C analyses on fossil wood collected from the late Miocene Khapchansky sediments of northeastern Siberia (69N). From these data we quantified the ratio of summer to winter precipitation (Ps/Pw) and compared it to current values for the region determined from modern wood samples and instrumental records. We observed much greater frequency of winter-dominated precipitation (Ps/Pw  1) and much greater variability in Ps/Pw during the Miocene than today. Specifically, years with Ps/Pw  1 occurred three times more often, and years with at least three times as much precipitation in summer or winter (0.33  Ps/Pw  3.0) occurred approximately twice as often during the Miocene than today. We attribute the high interannual variability in precipitation to an inconsistent moisture source associated with the relatively unstable and incomplete ice cover in the Arctic Ocean during the late Miocene. Our result highlights the potential for enhanced variability in Arctic precipitation in response to Arctic sea ice decline caused by anthropogenic, CO2-induced warming.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Processing political misinformation: comprehending the Trump phenomenon](http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/4/3/160802)
___

**Abstract**

This study investigated the cognitive processing of true and false political information. Specifically, it examined the impact of source credibility on the assessment of veracity when information comes from a polarizing source (Experiment 1), and effectiveness of explanations when they come from one's own political party or an opposition party (Experiment 2). These experiments were conducted prior to the 2016 Presidential election. Participants rated their belief in factual and incorrect statements that President Trump made on the campaign trail; facts were subsequently affirmed and misinformation retracted. Participants then re-rated their belief immediately or after a delay. Experiment 1 found that (i) if information was attributed to Trump, Republican supporters of Trump believed it more than if it was presented without attribution, whereas the opposite was true for Democrats and (ii) although Trump supporters reduced their belief in misinformation items following a correction, they did not change their voting preferences. Experiment 2 revealed that the explanation's source had relatively little impact, and belief updating was more influenced by perceived credibility of the individual initially purporting the information. These findings suggest that people use political figures as a heuristic to guide evaluation of what is true or false, yet do not necessarily insist on veracity as a prerequisite for supporting political candidates. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [River logjams cause frequent large-scale forest die-off events in Southwestern Amazonia](http://www.earth-syst-dynam-discuss.net/esd-2017-19/)
___

**Abstract**

This paper investigates the dynamics of logjam-induced floods and alluvium deposition in the Bolivian Amazon and the effects these have on forest disturbance/recovery cycles. It expands on previous work by Gullison et al (1996) who reported a case of catastrophic floods triggered by logjams in the Chimane Forest on the Bolivian Amazon. No further studies have followed up on this observation and no research has been published on the effects of large wood in tropical lowland rivers. The study is based on the analysis of a time series of Landsat imagery (19842016) and field evidence. Results show that logjam-induced floods are a major driver of forest disturbance along the Andean piedmont in the Bolivian Amazon. Logjams form on an almost yearly basis and migrate upriver until an avulsion takes place. Logjam-induced floods are here characterized by a sudden deposition of a thick sand layer and the death of forest in a V-shaped area. The Bolivian Amazon offers a unique opportunity to further research on how large wood affects river behavior in lowland tropical settings and how large and frequent forest disturbance events resulting from river logjams affect forest biodiversity and community successions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Excellent, thank you. Though the description touches on it I would note the following:

Scientists have hypothesized that, just prior to the Younger Dryas, meltwater fluxes were rerouted from the Mississippi River to the St. Lawrence River... although other possible routings such as to the Mackenzie River cannot be ruled out presently.

Indeed, in '06 Broecker had suggested the Mackenzie River route, though, at the the time lacked evidence to support the theory^[1](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/312/5777/1146) Further examination would lead to confirmation of Broecker's theory years later^[2](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7289/abs/nature08954.html), ^[3](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7289/fig_tab/nature08954_F1.html)

Here we use three independent meteorological data sets from the modern satellite era, to examine the temporal characteristics of the Lorenz energy cycle of Earths global atmosphere in response to climate change. The total mechanical energy of the global atmosphere basically remains constant with time, but the global-average eddy energies show significant positive trends. The spatial investigations suggest that these positive trends are concentrated in the Southern Hemisphere. Significant positive trends are also found in the conversion, generation and dissipation rates of energies. The positive trends in the dissipation rates of kinetic energies suggest that the efficiency of the global atmosphere as a heat engine increased during the modern satellite era. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access); [Evidence for a bi-partition of the Younger Dryas Stadial in East Asia associated with inversed climate characteristics compared to Europe](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep44983)
___

**Abstract**

The Younger Dryas Stadial (YDS) was an episode of northern hemispheric cooling which occurred within the Last Glacial Interglacial Transition (LGIT). A major driver for the YDS climate was a weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). It has been inferred that the AMOC began to strengthen mid-YDS, producing a bipartite structure of the YDS in records from continental Europe. These records imply that the polar front and westerlies shifted northward, producing a warmer second phase of the YDS in Europe. Here we present multi-proxy data from the sediments of Lake Suigetsu (Japan), as evidence that a related bi-partition of the YDS also occurred in East Asia. Besides showing for the first time that the bi-partition was not limited to the North Atlantic/European region, the data also imply a climatic dipole between Europe and East Asia since the cold-warm characteristics are reversed at Lake Suigetsu. We suggest that changes in eastward moisture transport from the North Atlantic are the primary mechanism by which the teleconnection can be explained. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [From interannual to decadal: 17 years of boundary current transports at the exit of the Labrador Sea](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JC012271/full)
___

**Abstract**

Over the past 17 years, the western boundary current system of the Labrador Sea has been closely observed by maintaining the 53N observatory (moorings and shipboard station data) measuring the top-to-bottom flow field offshore from the Labrador shelf break. Volume transports for the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) components were calculated using different methods, including gap filling procedures for deployment periods with suboptimal instrument coverage. On average the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) carries 30.26.6 Sv of NADW southward, which are almost equally partitioned between Labrador Sea Water (LSW, 14.93.9 Sv) and Lower North Atlantic Deep Water (LNADW, 15.33.8 Sv). The transport variability ranges from days to decades, with the most prominent multiyear fluctuations at interannual to near decadal time scales (5 Sv) in the LNADW overflow water mass. These long-term fluctuations appear to be in phase with the NAO-modulated wind fluctuations. The boundary current system off Labrador occurs as a conglomerate of nearly independent components, namely, the shallow Labrador Current, the weakly sheared LSW range, and the deep baroclinic, bottom-intensified current core of the LNADW, all of which are part of the cyclonic Labrador Sea circulation. This structure is relatively stable over time, and the 120 km wide boundary current is constrained seaward by a weak counterflow which reduces the deep water export by 1015%. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can you direct everyone to the journal from which that figure is supposedly modified from? I'd like to understand its context.

Broadly speaking, the ability for the atmosphere to hold water is reduced under colder conditions, and increased under warming conditions. You can see this when comparing two general classes of glaciers and noting their respective climates: warm based, or temperate glaciers and cold based glaciers, where warm based glaciers are typically located at lower latitudes and cold based glaciers are located at higher latitudes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Transboundary health impacts of transported global air pollution and international trade](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7647/full/nature21712.html)
___

**Abstract**

Millions of people die every year from diseases caused by exposure to outdoor air pollution. Some studies have estimated premature mortality related to local sources of air pollution, but local air quality can also be affected by atmospheric transport of pollution from distant sources. International trade is contributing to the globalization of emission and pollution as a result of the production of goods (and their associated emissions) in one region for consumption in another region. The effects of international trade on air pollutant emissions, air quality and health have been investigated regionally, but a combined, global assessment of the health impacts related to international trade and the transport of atmospheric air pollution is lacking. Here we combine four global models to estimate premature mortality caused by fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution as a result of atmospheric transport and the production and consumption of goods and services in different world regions. We find that, of the 3.45 million premature deaths related to PM2.5 pollution in 2007 worldwide, about 12 per cent (411,100 deaths) were related to air pollutants emitted in a region of the world other than that in which the death occurred, and about 22 per cent (762,400 deaths) were associated with goods and services produced in one region for consumption in another. For example, PM2.5 pollution produced in China in 2007 is linked to more than 64,800 premature deaths in regions other than China, including more than 3,100 premature deaths in western Europe and the USA; on the other hand, consumption in western Europe and the USA is linked to more than 108,600 premature deaths in China. Our results reveal that the transboundary health impacts of PM2.5 pollution associated with international trade are greater than those associated with long-distance atmospheric pollutant transport. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Cosmic Ray Modulation and Radiation Dose of Aircrews During the Solar Cycle 24/25](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016SW001588/abstract)
___

**Abstract**

Weak solar activity and high cosmic-ray flux during the coming solar cycle are qualitatively anticipated by the recent observations that show the decline in the solar activity levels. We predict the cosmic-ray modulation and resultant radiation exposure at flight altitude by using the time-dependent and three dimensional model of the cosmic-ray modulation. Our galactic cosmic ray (GCR) model is based on the variations of the solar wind speed, the strength of the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF), and the tilt angle of the heliospheric current sheet. We reproduce the 22-year variation of the cosmic-ray modulation from 1980 to 2015 taking into account the gradient-curvature drift motion of GCRs. The energy spectra of GCR protons obtained by our model show good agreement with the observations by BESS and PAMELA except for a discrepancy at the solar maximum. Five year annual radiation dose around the solar minimum at the solar cycle 24/25 will be approximately 19% higher than that in the last cycle. This is caused by the charge sign dependence of the cosmic-ray modulation, such as the flat-top profiles in a positive polarity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [A tipping point in refreezing accelerates mass loss of Greenlands glaciers and ice caps](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14730)
___

**Abstract**

Melting of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) and its peripheral glaciers and ice caps (GICs) contributes about 43% to contemporary sea level rise. While patterns of GrIS mass loss are well studied, the spatial and temporal evolution of GICs mass loss and the acting processes have remained unclear. Here we use a novel, 1km surface mass balance product, evaluated against in situ and remote sensing data, to identify 1997 (5 years) as a tipping point for GICs mass balance. That year marks the onset of a rapid deterioration in the capacity of the GICs firn to refreeze meltwater. Consequently, GICs runoff increases 65% faster than meltwater production, tripling the post-1997 mass loss to 3616Gt1, or 14% of the Greenland total. In sharp contrast, the extensive inland firn of the GrIS retains most of its refreezing capacity for now, buffering 22% of the increased meltwater production. This underlines the very different response of the GICs and GrIS to atmospheric warming. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Distributions of Earths species are changing at accelerating rates, increasingly driven by human-mediated climate change. Such changes are already altering the composition of ecological communities, but beyond conservation of natural systems, how and why does this matter? We review evidence that climate-driven species redistribution at regional to global scales affects ecosystem functioning, human well-being, and the dynamics of climate change itself. Production of natural resources required for food security, patterns of disease transmission, and processes of carbon sequestration are all altered by changes in species distribution. Consideration of these effects of biodiversity redistribution is critical yet lacking in most mitigation and adaptation strategies, including the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Compared to the warming throughout the Quaternary period, no it's not abrupt. In fact, I think you'll find the term 'abrupt', in a geological context, to be quite ambiguous - varying by a great degree from paper to paper. I really don't think you understand the context of the discussion to be honest, as you repeatedly gloss over my comment and continue to push for a hypothesis that is not widely accepted. I would implore you to define how abrupt the warming during the end Permian was before continuing to push your argument any further. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did not say that there isn't evidence, I said the Clathrate Gun Hypothesis is not not widely accepted, which is a factual statement. The Permo-Triassic isn't considered an abrupt warming event, it's a mass extinction event which was initiated with abrupt cooling into a relatively short ice age^[1](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep43630) before warming over several phases, and tens of thousands of years. 

Notice that I stated abrupt warming events, and then showed a figure of marine isotope stages (MIS). Note too that the timeline from past to present is from right to left. Each stage, broadly speaking, shows an abrupt warming, followed by step-wise cooling into glacial conditions. For example, abrupt warming episodes can clearly be seen from MIS12 - 11, 10 - 9, 6 - 5, 2 -1, etc. Non of which is there any evidence to support an argument such as the Clathrate Gun Hypothesis. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In all fairness, it is not. While it is certainly of concern when considering our carbon budget and warming, it's far too often over exaggerated and touted as a doomsday scenario. For one, the so-called 'Clathrate Gun Hypothesis' is not widely accepted, and for good reason. Recent studies also find such a scenario to be unlikely^[1](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016RG000534/full), ^[2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL068999/abstract), ^[3](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL069292/full) . If it were indeed such a likely scenario, why is there no evidence of it occurring during any of the previous abrupt warming episodes? (see [here](http://www.geo.arizona.edu/palynology/geos462/QuaTimeMIS.jpg) for example, the odd numbers are periods of relative warmth, while the even numbers are periods of relative cold - ie. glacial / interglacial periods) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Influence of Anthropogenic Climate Change on Planetary Wave Resonance and Extreme Weather Events](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep45242)
___

**Abstract**

Persistent episodes of extreme weather in the Northern Hemisphere summer have been shown to be associated with the presence of high-amplitude quasi-stationary atmospheric Rossby waves within a particular wavelength range (zonal wavenumber 68). The underlying mechanistic relationship involves the phenomenon of quasi-resonant amplification (QRA) of synoptic-scale waves with that wavenumber range becoming trapped within an effective mid-latitude atmospheric waveguide. Recent work suggests an increase in recent decades in the occurrence of QRA-favorable conditions and associated extreme weather, possibly linked to amplified Arctic warming and thus a climate change influence. Here, we isolate a specific fingerprint in the zonal mean surface temperature profile that is associated with QRA-favorable conditions. State-of-the-art (CMIP5) historical climate model simulations subject to anthropogenic forcing display an increase in the projection of this fingerprint that is mirrored in multiple observational surface temperature datasets. Both the models and observations suggest this signal has only recently emerged from the background noise of natural variability. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [US CH4 Emissions from Oil and Gas Production: Have Recent Large Increases Been Detected?](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JD026157/abstract)
___

**Abstract**

Recent studies have proposed significant increases in CH4 emissions possibly from oil and gas (O G) production, especially for the US where O G production has reached historically high levels over the past decade [US EIA, 2016; Turner et al., 2016; Hausmann et al., 2015; Franco et al., 2016]. In this study, we show that an ensemble of time-dependent atmospheric inversions constrained by calibrated atmospheric observations of surface CH4 mole fraction, with some including space-based retrievals of column average CH4 mole fractions, suggests that North American CH4 emissions have been flat over years spanning 2000 through 2012. Estimates of emission trends using zonal gradients of column average CH4 calculated relative to an upstream background are not easy to make due to atmospheric variability, relative insensitivity of column average CH4 to surface emissions at regional scales, and fast zonal synoptic transport. In addition, any trends in continental enhancements of column average CH4 are sensitive to how the upstream background is chosen, and model simulations imply that short-term (4years or less) trends in column average CH4 horizontal gradients of up to 1.5ppb/yr can occur just from inter-annual transport variability acting on a strong latitudinal CH4 gradient. Finally, trends in spatial gradients calculated from space-based column average CH4 can be significantly biased (2-3ppb/yr) due to the non-uniform and seasonally varying temporal coverage of satellite retrievals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Article (open access): [A roadmap for rapid decarbonization](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6331/1269.full)
___

**Summary**

Although the Paris Agreement's goals are aligned with science and can, in principle, be technically and economically achieved, alarming inconsistencies remain between science-based targets and national commitments. Despite progress during the 2016 Marrakech climate negotiations, long-term goals can be trumped by political short-termism. Following the Agreement, which became international law earlier than expected, several countries published mid-century decarbonization strategies, with more due soon. Model-based decarbonization assessments and scenarios often struggle to capture transformative change and the dynamics associated with it: disruption, innovation, and nonlinear change in human behavior. For example, in just 2 years, China's coal use swung from 3.7% growth in 2013 to a decline of 3.7% in 2015. To harness these dynamics and to calibrate for short-term realpolitik, we propose framing the decarbonization challenge in terms of a global decadal roadmap based on a simple heuristica carbon lawof halving gross anthropogenic carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions every decade. Complemented by immediately instigated, scalable carbon removal and efforts to ramp down land-use CO2 emissions, this can lead to net-zero emissions around mid-century, a path necessary to limit warming to well below 2C.

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Increased Land Subsidence and Sea-Level Rise are Submerging Egypts Nile Delta Coastal Margin](http://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/27/5/article/GSATG312A.1.htm)
___

**Abstract**

Egypts Nile delta, only ~1 m above mean sea level at the Mediterranean coast, is subject to uneven rates of submergence. This is a response to several factors leading to increasing land lowering (subsidence) of the northern delta and adjacent seafloor, plus an accelerating rise in eustatic (world) sea level in the Mediterranean. An average eustatic sea-level rise of ~3 mm/yr represents only ~26% to 45% of total relative sea-level rise measured along this margin. Three factors leading to subsidence are neotectonic lowering, compaction of Holocene sequences, and diminished sediment replenishment by much reduced Nile flow to Egypts coast. Subsidence accounts for variable average land lowering of ~3.7 mm/yr of section in the NW delta, ~7.7 mm/yr in the N delta, and ~8.4 mm/yr in the NE delta, based on compaction rates of strata thicknesses that decrease down-core between top and base of Holocene sections in 85 drill cores distributed along the delta margin. Among present critical challenges are marked reduction of Nile water and sediment below the High Aswan Dam that can now reach the delta coast. It is expected that problems of fresh water and energy poverty in the lower Nile Basin are likely to be seriously exacerbated in years ahead by construction of Ethiopias Grand Renaissance Dam (GERD). Completion of this, the biggest hydroelectric structure in Africa, is this year. Egypt, the Sudan, and Ethiopia must resolve the looming crisis of diminished Blue Nile water and sediment distribution to the lower Nile Basin and Egypts delta margin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Weather conditions conducive to Beijing severe haze more frequent under climate change](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3249.html)
___

**Abstract**

The frequency of Beijing winter severe haze episodes has increased substantially over the past decades, and is commonly attributed to increased pollutant emissions from Chinas rapid economic development. During such episodes, levels of fine particulate matter are harmful to human health and the environment, and cause massive disruption to economic activities, as occurred in January 2013. Conducive weather conditions are an important ingredient of severe haze episodes, and include reduced surface winter northerlies, weakened northwesterlies in the midtroposphere, and enhanced thermal stability of the lower atmosphere. How such weather conditions may respond to climate change is not clear. Here we project a 50% increase in the frequency and an 80% increase in the persistence of conducive weather conditions similar to those in January 2013, in response to climate change. The frequency and persistence between the historical (19501999) and future (20502099) climate were compared in 15 models under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5). The increased frequency is consistent with large-scale circulation changes, including an Arctic Oscillation upward trend, weakening East Asian winter monsoon, and faster warming in the lower troposphere. Thus, circulation changes induced by global greenhouse gas emissions can contribute to the increased Beijing severe haze frequency. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Arctic sea ice, Eurasia snow, and extreme winter haze in China](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/3/e1602751.full)
___

**Abstract**

The East China Plains (ECP) region experienced the worst haze pollution on record for January in 2013. We show that the unprecedented haze event is due to the extremely poor ventilation conditions, which had not been seen in the preceding three decades. Statistical analysis suggests that the extremely poor ventilation conditions are linked to Arctic sea ice loss in the preceding autumn and extensive boreal snowfall in the earlier winter. We identify the regional circulation mode that leads to extremely poor ventilation over the ECP region. Climate model simulations indicate that boreal cryospheric forcing enhances the regional circulation mode of poor ventilation in the ECP region and provides conducive conditions for extreme haze such as that of 2013. Consequently, extreme haze events in winter will likely occur at a higher frequency in China as a result of the changing boreal cryosphere, posing difficult challenges for winter haze mitigation but providing a strong incentive for greenhouse gas emission reduction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When it comes to coal, the markets simply don't care what Trump has to say. 

**Conclusion**

The U.S. coal industry is not on a path to recovery in the short or the long term, due to market dynamics unrelated to regulation. The industry will continue to suffer from declining demand, low prices, and its inability to compete with natural gas and renewable energy.  

Expectations will go unmet for more export sales, new coal-plant construction, and expensive coal-plant retrofits.

While times may have changed politically, the U.S. coal industry remains in financial and fundamental decline.

As far as I'm aware, the concentration of atmospheric oxygen is considered a factor during the late Carboniferous and early Permian period^[1](http://i.imgur.com/OA7wea3.jpg) which allowed insects to grow to rather large proportions. This is well before the age of the dinosaurs, and well before the peak of some of the largest dinosaurs to have evolved. 

The study (which is open access) discusses several driving factors for dwarfism, none of which include pO2%. The study suggests Bergmann's rule, and pCO2% (associated with higher temperatures, decreased water, differing precipitation patterns, and nutrient availability) as possible driving mechanisms. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Repetitive mammalian dwarfing during ancient greenhouse warming events](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/3/e1601430.full)
___

**Abstract**

Abrupt perturbations of the global carbon cycle during the early Eocene are associated with rapid global warming events, which are analogous in many ways to present greenhouse warming. Mammal dwarfing has been observed, along with other changes in community structure, during the largest of these ancient global warming events, known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum [PETM; ~56 million years ago (Ma)]. We show that mammalian dwarfing accompanied the subsequent, smaller-magnitude warming event known as Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 [ETM2 (~53 Ma)]. Statistically significant decrease in body size during ETM2 is observed in two of four taxonomic groups analyzed in this study and is most clearly observed in early equids (horses). During ETM2, the best-sampled lineage of equids decreased in size by ~14%, as opposed to ~30% during the PETM. Thus, dwarfing appears to be a common evolutionary response of some mammals during past global warming events, and the extent of dwarfing seems related to the magnitude of the event. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Timing of global regression and microbial bloom linked with the Permian-Triassic boundary mass extinction: implications for driving mechanisms](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep43630)
___

**Abstract**

New high-resolution U-Pb dates indicate a duration of 89  38 kyr for the Permian hiatus and of 14  57 kyr for the overlying Triassic microbial limestone in shallow water settings of the Nanpanjiang Basin, South China. The age and duration of the hiatus coincides with the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) and the extinction interval in the Meishan Global Stratotype Section and Point, and strongly supports a glacio-eustatic regression, which best explains the genesis of the worldwide hiatus straddling the PTB in shallow water records. In adjacent deep marine troughs, rates of sediment accumulation display a six-fold decrease across the PTB compatible with a dryer and cooler climate as indicated by terrestrial plants. Our model of the Permian-Triassic boundary mass extinction (PTBME) hinges on the synchronicity of the hiatus with the onset of the Siberian Traps volcanism. This early eruptive phase released sulfur-rich volatiles into the stratosphere, thus simultaneously eliciting a short-lived ice age responsible for the global regression and a brief but intense acidification. Abrupt cooling, shrunk habitats on shelves and acidification may all have synergistically triggered the PTBME. Subsequently, the build-up of volcanic CO2 induced a transient cool climate whose early phase saw the deposition of the microbial limestone. </TEXT>

This early eruptive phase released sulfur-rich volatiles into the stratosphere, thus simultaneously eliciting a short-lived ice age responsible for the global regression and a brief but intense acidification. Abrupt cooling, shrunk habitats on shelves and acidification may all have synergistically triggered the PTBME. Subsequently, the build-up of volcanic CO2 induced a transient cool climate whose early phase saw the deposition of the microbial limestone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure how they came to 1.2C, as I've pointed out ITT and above, that (using HadCRUT) we're at [1.01247...C](http://globalwarmingindex.org/). Regardless, if we simply substitute 1.2C for 1.01247C in the above equation, we arrive at 1.49C in 16 years (2033), using a warming of 1.82C/century. 

Provided such a short interval of time, I think it's fair to state that a linear relationship is a reasonable approximation (obviously this doesn't hold for longer forecasts). Note too that other data sets provide different rates of warming. For example, NCEP TCR for the period 1975 - 2005 arrives at 1.49C/century, while Hadley arrives at 1.9C/century, a spread of ~0.4C between max and min rates. Even if the rate of warming increases (which it likely will) I still don't see a large difference. Let's assume present warming to be 0.02C/year and that it increases to 0.03C at 2025, let's also assume 1.2C instead of 1.01C. 

(1a) (8 yr)(0.02C/yr) + 1.2C = 1.36C by 2025 

(2a) (x)(0.03C/yr) + 1.36 = 1.5C  x = 4.7 years or ~5 years. So we reach 1.5C by 2030 (2025 + 5 years) instead of by 2033 as the clock suggests. 

I think I've been quite generous in the above set of equations as well, and yet the difference is not that large. Interestingly, if I use 1.01C instead of 1.2C we arrive at 1.5C in 19 years. With a little more fine tuning and getting even more generous with our rates of warming we have the following:

(1b) (4 yr)(0.02C/yr) + 1.01C = 1.09C by 2021

(2b) (4 yr)(0.03C/yr) + 1.09C = 1.21C by 2025

(3b) (x)(0.04C/yr) + 1.21 = 1.5C  x = 7.25 years or ~2032. Again, fairly generous with rates of warming and still not a large difference, less than a year off of the clock's suggested 2033. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What are your predictions? 

A quick glance at a couple of *very* rough approximations shows the following:

[1980 - 2016](http://i.imgur.com/9yzmau0.jpg): 1.5C wouldn't be reached until 2062 (45 years). Applying 0.3C uncertainty brings this down to 2044 (27 years). Granted the rate of warming is likely to increase so a linear approximation isn't the most suitable. Noting this, if we start from [2000 - 2016](http://i.imgur.com/rbHDsMf.jpg) in an attempt to bias our rates of warming to reflect more recent rates we see that 1.5C wouldn't be reached until 2054 (37 years). Again, applying a 0.3C uncertainty brings this down to 2038 (21 years).

Using a warming rate of [1.82C per century](https://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-1860-1880-and-1910-1940.htm) (GISS 1975-2005) or 0.0182C per year would result in (16 years)(0.0182C / year) + [1.01247C](http://globalwarmingindex.org/) = 1.3C by 2033 and 1.5C by 2043 (26 years). Note that this value is not all that different from the *very* rough, quick calculation above of 21 years.

As warming is likely to accelerate I'm sure such values as 21 and 26 years can be reduced further, however, I would be skeptical of having it reduced by what appear to be rather large values required in order to reduce it to less than 16 years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Major advance of South Georgia glaciers during the Antarctic Cold Reversal following extensive sub-Antarctic glaciation](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14798)
___

**Abstract**

The history of glaciations on Southern Hemisphere sub-polar islands is unclear. Debate surrounds the extent and timing of the last glacial advance and termination on sub-Antarctic South Georgia in particular. Here, using sea-floor geophysical data and marine sediment cores, we resolve the record of glaciation offshore of South Georgia through the transition from the Last Glacial Maximum to Holocene. We show a sea-bed landform imprint of a shelf-wide last glacial advance and progressive deglaciation. Renewed glacier resurgence in the fjords between c. 15,170 and 13,340yr ago coincided with a period of cooler, wetter climate known as the Antarctic Cold Reversal, revealing a cryospheric response to an Antarctic climate pattern extending into the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. We conclude that the last glaciation of South Georgia was extensive, and the sensitivity of its glaciers to climate variability during the last termination more significant than implied by previous studies. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Climate change will increase the risk of temperature extremes. Induced innovation could offset some of this threat. This paper explores the demand and supply for climate adaptation innovation in a market economy. Climate change induces this innovation because the rising temperatures increase demand for self protection products and for profit firms respond to these incentives. We then augment the model to introduce climate skeptics. Such skeptics reject the claim that the world is warming and thus do not increasingly demand adaptation products. We study how the economy's rate of adaptation innovation, cross city migration, real estate pricing and the welfare of agents with rational expectations are all affected by the presence of such skeptics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Clarifying the role of coastal and marine systems in climate mitigation](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fee.1451/full)
___

**Abstract**

The international scientific community is increasingly recognizing the role of natural systems in climate-change mitigation. While forests have historically been the primary focus of such efforts, coastal wetlands  particularly seagrasses, tidal marshes, and mangroves  are now considered important and effective long-term carbon sinks. However, some members of the coastal and marine policy and management community have been interested in expanding climate mitigation strategies to include other components within coastal and marine systems, such as coral reefs, phytoplankton, kelp forests, and marine fauna. We analyze the scientific evidence regarding whether these marine ecosystems and ecosystem components are viable long-term carbon sinks and whether they can be managed for climate mitigation. Our findings could assist decision makers and conservation practitioners in identifying which components of coastal and marine ecosystems should be prioritized in current climate mitigation strategies and policies.
___

**In a nutshell**:

\- Coastal wetlands sequester substantial amounts of carbon, mostly in soils

\- Interest in the climate benefits of coastal wetlands has drawn attention to how other components of marine ecosystems might play a role in climate mitigation

\- Coral reefs, kelp, and marine fauna, while important components of carbon cycling in the ocean, are not involved in long-term carbon sequestration

\- Due to jurisdictional issues, practical management of coral, phytoplankton, kelp, and marine fauna within climate mitigation frameworks would be difficult

\- Current climate mitigation efforts in the coastal and marine realm should focus primarily on coastal wetlands, as they represent long-term carbon sinks and potential carbon sources upon conversion, and can be managed for their carbon sequestration value </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Increased atmospheric ammonia over the world's major agricultural areas detected from space](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL072305/abstract)
___

**Abstract**

This study provides evidence of substantial increases in atmospheric ammonia (NH3) concentrations (14-year) over several of the worlds major agricultural regions, using recently available retrievals from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) aboard NASA's Aqua satellite. The main sources of atmospheric NH3 are farming and animal husbandry involving reactive nitrogen ultimately derived from fertilizer use; rates of emission are also sensitive to climate change. Significant increasing trends are seen over the US (2.61% yr^-1 ), the European Union (EU) (1.83% yr^-1 ), and China (2.27% yr^-1 ). Over the EU, the trend results from decreased scavenging by acid aerosols. Over the US, the increase results from a combination of decreased chemical loss and increased soil temperatures. Over China, decreased chemical loss, increasing temperatures, and increased fertilizer use all play a role. Over South Asia, increased NH3 emissions are masked by increased SO2 and NOx emissions, leading to increased aerosol loading and adverse health effects. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Modern warming is occurring at much faster rates than those recorded from the PETM. This is important because it relates to the adaptability of corals. It is certainly possible that warming, and anomalous warm events, may outpace the corals ability to adapt. However, it should also be noted that not every coral is the same - while some species may tolerate warmer temperatures, others may not. And, while some geographical locations may warm, others may provide refuge areas due to upwelling of colder, nutrient rich waters. The government of Australia provides an interesting read on the [history](http://coral.aims.gov.au/info/evolution.jsp) and [evolution](http://coral.aims.gov.au/info/evolution-species.jsp) of corals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because, it doesn't deviate from the trend of anomalously high temperatures resulting in thermal stress and subsequent bleaching: https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/bleachingoutlook_cfs/outlook_cfs.php And, in doing so, it doesn't require a unique explanation that may not be in good agreement with the data.

The abstract itself states the following:

The distinctive geographic footprints of recurrent bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef in 1998, 2002 and 2016 were determined by the spatial pattern of sea temperatures in each year.

If you disagree with the consensus view in the scientific literature (thermal stress leading to widespread bleaching events) perhaps you could provide some studies to support your position, should in fact you disagree.

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Assessing the Methane Emissions from Natural Gas-Fired Power Plants and Oil Refineries](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.6b05531)
___

**Abstract**

Presently, there is high uncertainty in estimates of methane (CH4) emissions from natural gas-fired power plants (NGPP) and oil refineries, two major end users of natural gas. Therefore, we measured CH4 and CO2 emissions at three NGPPs and three refineries using an aircraft-based mass balance technique. Average CH4 emission rates (NGPPs: 140  70 kg/h; refineries: 580  220 kg/h, 95% CL) were larger than facility-reported estimates by factors of 21120 (NGPPs) and 1190 (refineries). At NGPPs, the percentage of unburned CH4 emitted from stacks (0.010.14%) was much lower than respective facility-scale losses (0.100.42%), and CH4 emissions from both NGPPs and refineries were more strongly correlated with enhanced H2O concentrations (R^2 avg = 0.65) than with CO2 (R^2 avg = 0.21), suggesting noncombustion-related equipment as potential CH4 sources. Additionally, calculated throughput-based emission factors (EF) derived from the NGPP measurements made in this study were, on average, a factor of 4.4 (stacks) and 42 (facility-scale) larger than industry-used EFs. Subsequently, throughput-based EFs for both the NGPPs and refineries were used to estimate total U.S. emissions from these facility-types. Results indicate that NGPPs and oil refineries may be large sources of CH4 emissions and could contribute significantly (0.61  0.18 Tg CH4/yr, 95% CL) to U.S. emissions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Global warming and recurrent mass bleaching of corals](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7645/full/nature21707.html)
___

**Abstract**

During 20152016, record temperatures triggered a pan-tropical episode of coral bleaching, the third global-scale event since mass bleaching was first documented in the 1980s. Here we examine how and why the severity of recurrent major bleaching events has varied at multiple scales, using aerial and underwater surveys of Australian reefs combined with satellite-derived sea surface temperatures. The distinctive geographic footprints of recurrent bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef in 1998, 2002 and 2016 were determined by the spatial pattern of sea temperatures in each year. Water quality and fishing pressure had minimal effect on the unprecedented bleaching in 2016, suggesting that local protection of reefs affords little or no resistance to extreme heat. Similarly, past exposure to bleaching in 1998 and 2002 did not lessen the severity of bleaching in 2016. Consequently, immediate global action to curb future warming is essential to secure a future for coral reefs.

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Tardigrades Use Intrinsically Disordered Proteins to Survive Desiccation](http://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(17\)30133-8)
___

**Highlights**

 \- Tardigrade intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) are enriched during desiccation

 \- TDPs are required for tardigrades to survive desiccation

 \- Expression of TDPs increases desiccation tolerance in heterologous systems

 \- TDPs vitrify, and this vitrified state mirrors their protective capabilities

**Summary**

Tardigrades are microscopic animals that survive a remarkable array of stresses, including desiccation. How tardigrades survive desiccation has remained a mystery for more than 250 years. Trehalose, a disaccharide essential for several organisms to survive drying, is detected at low levels or not at all in some tardigrade species, indicating that tardigrades possess potentially novel mechanisms for surviving desiccation. Here we show that tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) are essential for desiccation tolerance. TDP genes are constitutively expressed at high levels or induced during desiccation in multiple tardigrade species. TDPs are required for tardigrade desiccation tolerance, and these genes are sufficient to increase desiccation tolerance when expressed in heterologous systems. TDPs form non-crystalline amorphous solids (vitrify) upon desiccation, and this vitrified state mirrors their protective capabilities. Our study identifies TDPs as functional mediators of tardigrade desiccation tolerance, expanding our knowledge of the roles and diversity of disordered proteins involved in stress tolerance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [A lower limit to atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the past 800,000 years](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2914.html)
___

**Abstract**

Global temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentrations varied widely over the glacial cycles of the past 800,000 years. But despite this variability, Antarctic ice cores have shown that CO2 concentrations were very similar during all the coldest points of these cycles. Remarkably, the recurring minimum CO2 concentrations (190  7ppm) fall on the lower bound of any known in Earth history. Here we show that although the volume of terrestrial ice sheets was normally distributed over the past 800,000 years, as might be expected from the approximately normal distribution of the orbital forcing that drove the glacial cycles, Antarctic temperatures have a strong cold mode, whereas CO2 concentrations have both a cold mode and a central mode. Although multiple explanations are possible, the recurring CO2 minima and pronounced cold modes are consistent with a strong negative feedback to decreasing CO2 that resisted further cooling on timescales shorter than 10,000 years. We suggest that one possible negative feedback is CO2-limitation of photosynthesis, either directly or via CO2-limitation of N2 fixation, which could have inhibited further lowering of CO2 by reducing carbon storage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Extreme sea levels on the rise along Europe's coasts](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016EF000505/full)
___

**Abstract**

Future extreme sea levels (ESLs) and flood risk along European coasts will be strongly impacted by global warming. Yet, comprehensive projections of ESL that include mean sea level (MSL), tides, waves, and storm surges do not exist. Here, we show changes in all components of ESLs until 2100 in view of climate change. We find that by the end of this century, the 100-year ESL along Europe's coastlines is on average projected to increase by 57 cm for Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP)4.5 and 81 cm for RCP8.5. The North Sea region is projected to face the highest increase in ESLs, amounting to nearly 1 m under RCP8.5 by 2100, followed by the Baltic Sea and Atlantic coasts of the UK and Ireland. Relative sea level rise (RSLR) is shown to be the main driver of the projected rise in ESL, with increasing dominance toward the end of the century and for the high-concentration pathway. Changes in storm surges and waves enhance the effects of RSLR along the majority of northern European coasts, locally with contributions up to 40%. In southern Europe, episodic extreme events tend to stay stable, except along the Portuguese coast and the Gulf of Cadiz where reductions in surge and wave extremes offset RSLR by 2030%. By the end of this century, 5 million Europeans currently under threat of a 100-year ESL could be annually at risk from coastal flooding under high-end warming. The presented dataset is available through this link: http://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/collection/LISCOAST.

**Plain Language Summary**

Future extreme sea levels and flood risk along European coasts will be strongly impacted by global warming. Here, we show changes in all acting components, i.e., sea level rise, tides, waves, and storm surges, until 2100 in view of climate change. We find that by the end of this century the 100-year event along Europe will on average increase between 57 and 81 cm. The North Sea region is projected to face the highest increase, amounting to nearly 1 m under a high emission scenario by 2100, followed by the Baltic Sea and Atlantic coasts of the UK and Ireland. Sea level rise is the main driver of the changes, but intensified climate extremes along most of northern Europe can have significant local effects. Little changes in climate extremes are shown along southern Europe, with the exception of a projected decrease along the Portuguese coast and the Gulf of Cadiz, offseting sea level rise by 2030%. By the end of this century, 5 million Europeans currently under threat of a 100-year coastal flood event could be annually at risk from coastal flooding under high-end warming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Terrestrial ecosystem model performance in simulating productivity and its vulnerability to climate change in the northern permafrost region](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JG003384/full)
___

**Abstract**

Realistic projection of future climate-carbon (C) cycle feedbacks requires better understanding and an improved representation of the C cycle in permafrost regions in the current generation of Earth system models. Here we evaluated 10 terrestrial ecosystem models for their estimates of net primary productivity (NPP) and responses to historical climate change in permafrost regions in the Northern Hemisphere. In comparison with the satellite estimate from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS; 2466gCm^2 yr^1 ), most models produced higher NPP (30912gCm^2 yr^1 ) over the permafrost region during 20002009. By comparing the simulated gross primary productivity (GPP) with a flux tower-based database, we found that although mean GPP among the models was only overestimated by 10% over 19822009, there was a twofold discrepancy among models (380 to 800gCm^2 yr^1 ), which mainly resulted from differences in simulated maximum monthly GPP (GPPmax). Most models overestimated C use efficiency (CUE) as compared to observations at both regional and site levels. Further analysis shows that model variability of GPP and CUE are nonlinearly correlated to variability in specific leaf area and the maximum rate of carboxylation by the enzyme Rubisco at 25C (Vcmax_25), respectively. The models also varied in their sensitivities of NPP, GPP, and CUE to historical changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 concentration. These results indicate that model predictive ability of the C cycle in permafrost regions can be improved by better representation of the processes controlling CUE and GPPmax as well as their sensitivity to climate change. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

In this study we conducted a comprehensive modeling analysis to identify global trends in extreme wave energy flux (WEF) along coastlines in the 21st century under a high emission pathway (Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5). For the end of the century, results show a significant increase up to 30% in 100 year return level WEF for the majority of the coastal areas of the southern temperate zone, while in the Northern Hemisphere large coastal areas are characterized by a significant negative trend. We show that the most significant long-term trends of extreme WEF can be explained by intensification of teleconnection patterns such as the Antarctic Oscillation, El NioSouthern Oscillation, and North Atlantic Oscillation. The projected changes will have broad implications for ocean engineering applications and disaster risk management. Especially low-lying coastal countries in the Southern Hemisphere will be particularly vulnerable due to the combined effects of projected relative sea level rise and more extreme wave activities. </TEXT>

**Abstract**

Climate models project a strong increase in Arctic precipitation over the coming century, which has been attributed primarily to enhanced surface evaporation associated with sea-ice retreat. Since the Arctic is still quite cold, especially in winter, it is often (implicitly) assumed that the additional precipitation will fall mostly as snow. However, little is known about future changes in the distributions of rainfall and snowfall in the Arctic. Here we use 37 state-of-the-art climate models in standardized twenty-first-century (20062100) simulations to show a decrease in average annual Arctic snowfall (7090N), despite the strong precipitation increase. Rain is projected to become the dominant form of precipitation in the Arctic region (20912100), as atmospheric warming causes a greater fraction of snowfall to melt before it reaches the surface, in particular over the North Atlantic and the Barents Sea. The reduction in Arctic snowfall is most pronounced during summer and autumn when temperatures are close to the melting point, but also winter rainfall is found to intensify considerably. Projected (seasonal) trends in rainfall and snowfall will heavily impact Arctic hydrology (for example, river discharge, permafrost melt), climatology (for example, snow, sea-ice albedo and melt) and ecology (for example, water and food availability). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Selenium deficiency risk predicted to increase under future climate change](http://www.pnas.org/content/114/11/2848.full)
___

**Significance**

The trace element selenium is essential for human health and is required in a narrow dietary concentration range. Insufficient selenium intake has been estimated to affect up to 1 billion people worldwide. Dietary selenium availability is controlled by soilplant interactions, but the mechanisms governing its broad-scale soil distributions are largely unknown. Using data-mining techniques, we modeled recent (19801999) distributions and identified climatesoil interactions as main controlling factors. Furthermore, using moderate climate change projections, we predicted future (20802099) soil selenium losses from 58% of modeled areas (mean loss = 8.4%). Predicted losses from croplands were even higher, with 66% of croplands predicted to lose 8.7% selenium. These losses could increase the worldwide prevalence of selenium deficiency.
 
**Abstract**

Deficiencies of micronutrients, including essential trace elements, affect up to 3 billion people worldwide. The dietary availability of trace elements is determined largely by their soil concentrations. Until now, the mechanisms governing soil concentrations have been evaluated in small-scale studies, which identify soil physicochemical properties as governing variables. However, global concentrations of trace elements and the factors controlling their distributions are virtually unknown. We used 33,241 soil data points to model recent (19801999) global distributions of Selenium (Se), an essential trace element that is required for humans. Worldwide, up to one in seven people have been estimated to have low dietary Se intake. Contrary to small-scale studies, soil Se concentrations were dominated by climatesoil interactions. Using moderate climate-change scenarios for 20802099, we predicted that changes in climate and soil organic carbon content will lead to overall decreased soil Se concentrations, particularly in agricultural areas; these decreases could increase the prevalence of Se deficiency. The importance of climatesoil interactions to Se distributions suggests that other trace elements with similar retention mechanisms will be similarly affected by climate change. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

This study investigates the fundamental causes of differences in the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) eastward propagation among models that participated in a recent model inter-comparison project. These models are categorized into good and poor groups characterized by prominent eastward propagation and non-propagation, respectively. Column integrated moist static energy (MSE) budgets are diagnosed for the good and the poor models. It is found that a zonal asymmetry in the MSE tendency, characteristic of eastward MJO propagation, occurs in the good group, while such an asymmetry does not exist in the poor group. The difference arises mainly from anomalous vertical and horizontal MSE advection. The former is attributed to the zonal asymmetry of upper-middle tropospheric vertical velocity anomalies acting on background MSE vertical gradient; the latter is mainly attributed to the asymmetric zonal distribution of low-tropospheric meridional wind anomalies advecting background MSE/moisture field. Based on the diagnosis above, a new mechanism for MJO eastward propagation that emphasizes the second-baroclinic-mode vertical velocity is proposed.

A set of atmospheric general circulation model experiments with prescribed diabatic heating profiles were conducted to investigate the causes of different anomalous circulations between the good and the poor models. The numerical experiments reveal that the presence of a stratiform heating at the rear of MJO convection is responsible for the zonal asymmetry of vertical velocity anomaly and is important to strengthening lower-tropospheric poleward flows to the east of MJO convection. Thus, a key to improve the poor models is to correctly reproduce the stratiform heating. The roles of Rossby and Kelvin wave components in MJO propagation are particularly discussed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Energy transfer from lower energy to higher-energy electrons mediated by whistler waves in the radiation belts](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JA023263/full)
___

**Abstract**

We study the problem of energy exchange between waves and particles, which leads to energization of the latter, in an unstable plasma typical of the radiation belts. The ongoing Van Allen Probes space mission brought this problem among the most discussed in space physics. A free energy which is present in an unstable plasma provides the indispensable condition for energy transfer from lower energy particles to higher-energy particles via resonant wave-particle interaction. This process is studied in detail by the example of electron interactions with whistler mode wave packets originated from lightning-induced emission. We emphasize that in an unstable plasma, the energy source for electron energization is the energy of other particles, rather than the wave energy as is often assumed. The way by which the energy is transferred from lower energy to higher-energy particles includes two processes that operate concurrently, in the same space-time domain, or sequentially, in different space-time domains, in which a given wave packet is located. In the first process, one group of resonant particles gives the energy to the wave. The second process consists in wave absorption by another group of resonant particles, whose energy therefore increases. We argue that this mechanism represents an efficient means of electron energization in the radiation belts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This study refers specifically to atmospheric circulation patterns over the Arctic, and has *nothing* to do with the Antarctic.

Projecting further into the future, the effects resulting from internal variability decrease as anthropogenic warming overwhelms the system. 

I would state that while we would likely be seeing a decrease in Arctic sea-ice, it would likely rebound and the (+/-) resulting from internal variability would likely continue a relatively flat trend. Natural variability, on decadal time scales, cannot explain the modern deviation as is seen in [Figure 3](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v479/n7374/fig_tab/nature10581_F3.html) of Kinnard et al "Reconstructed changes in Arctic sea ice over the past 1,450 years" without a strong anthropogenic component. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ...gasses absorb heat from the sun and create the greenhouse effect...

This can be misleading, as it implies the majority of greenhouse gases (GHG) absorb incoming solar radiation, when in fact, they are effectively invisible to the incoming solar radiation. However, the Earth absorbs the incoming short wave solar radiation and re-emits it as long wave radiation. This long wave radiation is what is absorbed by GHG and reflected back down towards the surface, generating the 'greenhouse effect'. The following simplified figure by [Chris Colose](https://chriscolose.wordpress.com/2008/03/09/physics-of-the-greenhouse-effect-pt-1/) illustrates this: http://i.imgur.com/nFfDuOv.gif    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Influence of high-latitude atmospheric circulation changes on summertime Arctic sea ice](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3241.html)
___

**Abstract**

The Arctic has seen rapid sea-ice decline in the past three decades, whilst warming at about twice the global average rate. Yet the relationship between Arctic warming and sea-ice loss is not well understood. Here, we present evidence that trends in summertime atmospheric circulation may have contributed as much as 60% to the September sea-ice extent decline since 1979. A tendency towards a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean with a barotropic structure in the troposphere increased the downwelling longwave radiation above the ice by warming and moistening the lower troposphere. Model experiments, with reanalysis data constraining atmospheric circulation, replicate the observed thermodynamic response and indicate that the near-surface changes are dominated by circulation changes rather than feedbacks from the changing sea-ice cover. Internal variability dominates the Arctic summer circulation trend and may be responsible for about 3050% of the overall decline in September sea ice since 1979. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Tree-ring width reveals the preparation of the 1974 Mt. Etna eruption](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep44019)
___

**Abstract**

Reduced near-infrared reflectance observed in September 1973 in Skylab images of the western flank of Mt. Etna has been interpreted as an eruption precursor of the January 1974 eruption. Until now, it has been unclear when this signal started, whether it was sustained and which process(es) could have caused it. By analyzing tree-ring width time-series, we show that the reduced near-infrared precursory signal cannot be linked to a reduction in annual tree growth in the area. However, comparing the tree-ring width time-series with both remote sensing observations and volcano-seismic activity enables us to discuss the starting date of the pre-eruptive period of the 1974 eruption. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I beg to differ. That is also not 'the full quote from the study', and discusses a different aspect of the study from which I am quoting - a simple ctrl F would have shown this. The section I am quoting is as follows:

"During the end-Triassic mass extinction event, relatively widespread groups are as likely to suffer high levels of extinction as groups with narrower geographic ranges. For example, Phytosauria and Theropoda have similar, geographic ranges in the Rhaetian ([Fig. 3](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8980/figures/3)). **However, phytosaurs suffer complete extinction at the end Triassic, whereas theropod diversity remains stable across the boundary and into the Hettangian**, even whilst undergoing significant range expansion ([Fig. 3](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8980/figures/3))." 

Note that the Rhaetian is the Late Triassic and the Hettangian is the Early Jurassic (you can review the geologic time scale [here](https://www.geosociety.org/GSA/Education_Careers/Geologic_Time_Scale/GSA/timescale/home.aspx)). If you examine [Fig. 3](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8980/figures/3) you'll note that the authors state the following: 

The Aetosauria, Cynognathia and Phytosauria became extinct during the biotic crisis, despite the widespread distribution of Cynognathia and Phytosauria in the Rhaetian. The Probainognathia, Sauropodomorpha and Theropoda all survived the biotic crisis and expanded their ranges in the Hettangian, albeit with different diversification trajectories. The diversity of Sauropodomorpha increased, the diversity of Theropoda was stationary and that of Probainognathia decreased across the boundary.

I fail to see how this paper supports your rather catastrophic position. The authors clearly state that while some terrestrial vertebrates become extinct, others remain stable, some decreased, while others actually increased across the boundary.

You repeatedly continue to jump to conclusions, claiming support for your position when there are in fact large gaps between what you claim is support for your position and what the studies actually discuss. There will certainly be hardships to overcome as conditions will most likely worsen over the coming decades; however, extinction of Homo sapiens is absolutely not among them, nor anywhere to be found in mainstream scientific literature. It's clear at this point that I'll just be repeating myself, as I have already done so multiple times, but your belief is simply unfounded, and cannot be taken seriously. As I recall from elsewhere ITT you mention a minimum of 50 years.

You claim to be a science writer, would you care to share any of your work? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do I really need to show that 'studies' is the plural of 'study'? You provided a single (major?) study that made very broad generalizations about terrestrial vertebrates during the end-Triassic. Of which, the study itself also stated that theropod diversity remained stable across the event. You would be effectively cherry picking the data to fit your personal bias. Of course there are concerns regarding our current and near future scenarios, however, the extinction of Homo sapiens in main stream scientific literature, is not among them. </TEXT>

That's not what you said. What you said is as follows:

And no one here is worried about human extinction. LOL.

Those two statements are not the same, nor are their implications.  I don't think anyone would argue that humans are immune to extinction (in fact I may as well be certain). However, you commented about humans going extinct in a thread dealing with the effects of climate change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Improved estimates of ocean heat content from 1960 to 2015](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/3/e1601545.full)
___

**Abstract**

Earths energy imbalance (EEI) drives the ongoing global warming and can best be assessed across the historical record (that is, since 1960) from ocean heat content (OHC) changes. An accurate assessment of OHC is a challenge, mainly because of insufficient and irregular data coverage. We provide updated OHC estimates with the goal of minimizing associated sampling error. We performed a subsample test, in which subsets of data during the data-rich Argo era are colocated with locations of earlier ocean observations, to quantify this error. Our results provide a new OHC estimate with an unbiased mean sampling error and with variability on decadal and multidecadal time scales (signal) that can be reliably distinguished from sampling error (noise) with signal-to-noise ratios higher than 3. The inferred integrated EEI is greater than that reported in previous assessments and is consistent with a reconstruction of the radiative imbalance at the top of atmosphere starting in 1985. We found that changes in OHC are relatively small before about 1980; since then, OHC has increased fairly steadily and, since 1990, has increasingly involved deeper layers of the ocean. In addition, OHC changes in six major oceans are reliable on decadal time scales. All ocean basins examined have experienced significant warming since 1998, with the greatest warming in the southern oceans, the tropical/subtropical Pacific Ocean, and the tropical/subtropical Atlantic Ocean. This new look at OHC and EEI changes over time provides greater confidence than previously possible, and the data sets produced are a valuable resource for further study. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To clarify my point, I think there is a probability that climate change could result in economic catastrophe, and that there is also a probability that climate change could result in the collapse of specific civilizations *as we know them to be*. How high or low the probability of such an outcome occurring, however, remains largely uncertain. Equating economic catastrophe, or even the collapse of one or more societies to the extinction of Homo sapiens is simply wrong. Economic catastrophe  extinction of Homo sapiens, nor does the collapse of a single or multiple societies. 

For the above I have assumed that each of their premises to be true. That is to say that I have assumed the following statement to be true in its entirety:

 "All evidence around me says global civilizational collapse is inevitable and is happening as we speak."

However, should this assumption be false it further weakens the original argument (human extinction). I'm almost certain that the assumption is false. </TEXT>

All the study states is that - broadly speaking - terrestrial vertebrates with geographically wide distributions, during the end-Triassic, were affected by the event. It also states that theropod diversity remained stable across the event, even while significantly expanding ranges. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You still haven't provided any studies to back your initial claim relating to extinction of Homo sapiens. What you are in fact arguing in favor for is economic catastrophe, and collapse of civilization *as we know it*, but the conclusion (extinction of Homo sapiens) simply does not follow from the premises (ie. non sequitur). It's an invalid argument. This is without questioning the validity of your premises either. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Soil organic carbon harbors three times as much carbon as Earths atmosphere, and its decomposition is a potentially large climate change feedback and major source of uncertainty in climate projections. The response of whole-soil profiles to warming has not been tested in situ. In this deep warming experiment in mineral soil, CO2 production from all soil depths increased significantly with 4C warmingannual soil respiration increased by 34-37%. All depths responded to warming with similar temperature sensitivities, driven by decomposition of decadal-aged carbon. Whole-soil warming reveals a larger soil respiration response than many in situ experiments, most of which only warm the surface soil, and models. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Elevated atmospheric CO2 negatively impacts photosynthesis through radiative forcing and physiology-mediated climate feedback](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL071733/abstract)
___

**Abstract**

Increasing atmospheric CO2 affects photosynthesis involving directly increasing leaf carboxylation rates, stomatal closure, and climatic effects. The direct effects are generally thought to be positive leading to increased photosynthesis, while its climatic effects can be regionally positive or negative. These effects are usually considered to be independent from each other, but they are in fact coupled through interactions between land surface exchanges of gases and heat and the physical climate system. In particular, stomatal closure reduces evapotranspiration and increases sensible heat emissions from ecosystems, leading to decreased atmospheric moisture and precipitation and local warming. We use a coupled earth system model to attribute the influence of the increase in CO2 on gross primary productivity (GPP) during the period of 19302011. In our model, CO2 radiative effects cause climate change that has only a negligible effect on global GPP (a reduction of 0.9  2% during the last 80 years) because of opposite responses between tropical and northern biomes. On the other hand, CO2 physiological effects on GPP are both positive, by increased carboxylation rates and water use efficiency (7.1  0.48% increase), and negative, by vegetation-climate feedback reducing precipitation, as a consequence of decreased transpiration and increased sensible heat in areas without water limitation (2.7  1.76% reduction).When considering the coupled atmosphere-vegetation system, negative climate feedback on photosynthesis and plant growth due to the current level of CO2 opposes 2938% of the gains from direct fertilization effects. </TEXT>

**Abstract**

Rising atmospheric CO2 stimulates photosynthesis and productivity of forests, offsetting CO2 emissions. Elevated CO2 experiments in temperate planted forests yielded ~23% increases in productivity over the initial years. Whether similar CO2 stimulation occurs in mature evergreen broadleaved forests on low-phosphorus (P) soils is unknown, largely due to lack of experimental evidence. This knowledge gap creates major uncertainties in future climate projections as a large part of the tropics is P-limited. Here, we increased atmospheric CO2 concentration in a mature broadleaved evergreen eucalypt forest for three years, in the first large-scale experiment on a P-limited site. We show that tree growth and other aboveground productivity components did not significantly increase in response to elevated CO2 in three years, despite a sustained 19% increase in leaf photosynthesis. Moreover, tree growth in ambient CO2 was strongly P-limited and increased by ~35% with added phosphorus. The findings suggest that P availability may potentially constrain CO2-enhanced productivity in P-limited forests; hence, future atmospheric CO2 trajectories may be higher than predicted by some models. As a result, coupled climatecarbon models should incorporate both nitrogen and phosphorus limitations to vegetation productivity in estimating future carbon sinks. </TEXT>

This means the escape velocity, given by [Ve=(2GM/r)^1/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity) , on Venus is substantially more than on Mars. Thus lighter molecules can more readily escape Mars than they can Venus as it takes far less energy to reach said velocities (10.4km/s on Venus, and 5.0km/s on Mars)^[1](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/)

The other contributing factor is large and small scale volcanism on Venus. There is much that is unknown, and debated, when it comes to volcanism on Venus; however, it is believed that the entire planet undergoes massive magmatic episodes every 500 million years or so, resurfacing Venus in its entirety. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Rapid emergence of climate change in environmental drivers of marine ecosystems](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14682)
___

**Abstract**

Climate change is expected to modify ecological responses in the ocean, with the potential for important effects on the ecosystem services provided to humankind. Here we address the question of how rapidly multiple drivers of marine ecosystem change develop in the future ocean. By analysing an ensemble of models we find that, within the next 15 years, the climate change-driven trends in multiple ecosystem drivers emerge from the background of natural variability in 55% of the ocean and propagate rapidly to encompass 86% of the ocean by 2050 under a business-as-usual scenario. However, we also demonstrate that the exposure of marine ecosystems to climate change-induced stress can be drastically reduced via climate mitigation measures; with mitigation, the proportion of ocean susceptible to multiple drivers within the next 15 years is reduced to 34%. Mitigation slows the pace at which multiple drivers emerge, allowing an additional 20 years for adaptation in marine ecological and socio-economic systems alike. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Aerosolized microorganisms may play an important role in climate change, disease transmission, water and soil contaminants, and geographic migration of microbes. While it is known that bioaerosols are generated when bubbles break on the surface of water containing microbes, it is largely unclear how viable soil-based microbes are transferred to the atmosphere. Here we report a previously unknown mechanism by which rain disperses soil bacteria into the air. Bubbles, tens of micrometres in size, formed inside the raindrops disperse micro-droplets containing soil bacteria during raindrop impingement. A single raindrop can transfer 0.01% of bacteria on the soil surface and the bacteria can survive more than one hour after the aerosol generation process. This work further reveals that bacteria transfer by rain is highly dependent on the regional soil profile and climate conditions.

<TEXT> Let's say that we have a system of three boxes: X,Y,Z, and now let's use the 2^nd law of thermodynamics as an analog (which states that entropy either goes up, or remains constant). Therefore, If I put more energy into box X, the entire energy of the entire system must also increase or boxes Y and Z must decrease to remain constant. 

Analogously, we can think of the Earth as having different components that make up its climate system. Humans have very clearly continued to increase the amount of energy being dumped into the climate system, so (a) what should we expect, and (b) what do we see? We should expect to see that energy somewhere in the system, if we're not seeing it in surface and atmospheric temperatures, where is it? What the data shows is while box Y (surface temps.) and Z (tropospheric temps) saw no significant increase, the other box, box X (the oceans) continues to see an increase in the amount of energy it is absorbing: http://i.imgur.com/z5t04qT.jpg

So, when contrarians argue that the 'hiatus' shows a pause in global warming, they are incorrect as they are not account for the entire system, but rather they are looking at a select component. This is a fallacy better known as the [Fallacy of composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_composition):

The fallacy of composition arises when one infers that something is true of the *whole* from the fact that it is true of some *part* of the whole

In short then, /u/Bowgentle is entirely correct. It does 'nada' to the 'man-made climate change argument' as /u/ImBoredLetsDebate asked. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Sensitivity of grassland productivity to aridity controlled by stomatal and xylem regulation](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2903.html)
___

**Abstract**

The terrestrial water and carbon cycles are coupled through plant regulation of stomatal closure. Both soil moisture and vapour pressure deficitthe amount of moisture in the air relative to its potential maximumcan govern stomatal closure, which reduces plant carbon uptake. However, plants vary in the degree to which they regulate their stomataand in association, xylem conductancein response to increasing aridity: isohydric plants exert tight regulation of stomata and the water content of the plant, whereas anisohydric plants do not. Here we use remote-sensing data sets of anisohydricity and vegetation greenness to show that productivity in United States grasslandsespecially anisohydric onesis far more sensitive to variations in vapour pressure deficit than to variations in precipitation. Anisohydric ecosystem productivity is over three times more sensitive to vapour pressure deficit than isohydric ecosystem productivity. The precipitation sensitivity of summer productivity increases with anisohydricity only for the most anisohydric ecosystems. We conclude that increases in vapour pressure deficit rather than changes in precipitationboth of which are expected impacts of climate changewill be a dominant influence on future grassland productivity. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

It is commonly expected that the world's lowest income countries will face some of the worst impacts of global warming, despite contributing the least to greenhouse gas emissions. Using global atmospheric reanalyses we show that the world's lowest income countries are already experiencing greater increases in the occurrence of temperature extremes compared to the highest income countries, and have been for over two decades. Not only are low income countries less able to support mitigation and adaptation efforts, but their typically equatorial location predisposes them to lower natural temperature variability and thus greater changes in the occurrence of temperature extremes with global warming. This aspect of global warming is well known but overlooked in current international climate policy agreements and we argue that it is an important factor in reducing inequity due to climate impacts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Liquid Water Flow and Retention on the Greenland Ice Sheet in the Regional Climate Model HIRHAM5: Local and Large-Scale Impacts](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/feart.2016.00110/full)
___

**Abstract**

To improve Greenland Ice Sheet surface mass balance (SMB) simulation, the subsurface scheme of the HIRHAM5 regional climate model was extended to include snow densification, varying hydraulic conductivity, irreducible water saturation and other effects on snow liquid water percolation and retention. Sensitivity experiments to investigate the effects of the additions and the impact of different parameterization choices are presented. Compared with 68 accumulation area ice cores, the simulated mean annual net accumulation bias is 5% (correlation coefficient of 0.90). Modeled SMB in the ablation area compares favorably with 1041 PROMICE observations with regression slope of 0.950.97 (depending on model configuration), correlation coefficient of 0.750.86 and mean bias 3%. Weighting ablation area SMB biases at low- and high-elevation with the amount of runoff from these areas, we estimate ice sheet-wide mass loss biases in the ablation area at 5 and 7% using observed (MODIS-derived) and internally calculated albedo, respectively. Comparison with observed melt day counts shows that patterns of spatial (correlation ~0.9) and temporal (correlation coefficient of ~0.9) variability are realistically represented in the simulations. However, the model tends to underestimate the magnitude of inter-annual variability (regression slope ~0.7) and overestimate that of spatial variability (slope ~1.2). In terms of subsurface temperature structure and occurrence of perennial firn aquifers and perched ice layers, the most important model choices are the albedo implementation and irreducible water saturation parameterization. At one percolation area location, for instance, the internally calculated albedo yields too high subsurface temperatures below 5 m, but when using an implementation of irreducible saturation allowing higher values, an ice layer forms in 2011, reducing the deep warm bias in subsequent years. On the other hand, prior to the formation of the ice layer, observed albedos combined with lower irreducible saturation give the smallest bias. Perennial firn aquifers and perched ice layers occur in varying thickness and area for different model parameter choices. While the occurrence of these features has an influence on the local-scale subsurface temperature, snow, ice and water fields, the Greenland-wide runoff and SMB arein the model's current climatedominated by the albedo implementation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Atmospheric footprint of the recent warming slowdown](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep40947)
___

**Abstract**

Growing body of literature has developed to detect the role of ocean heat uptake and transport in the recent warming slowdown between 19982013; however, the atmospheric footprint of the slowdown in dynamical and physical processes remains unclear. Here, we divided recent decades into the recent hiatus period and the preceding warming period (19831998) to investigate the atmospheric footprint. We use a process-resolving analysis method to quantify the contributions of different processes to the total temperature changes. We show that the increasing rate of global mean tropospheric temperature was also reduced during the hiatus period. The decomposed trends due to physical processes, including surface albedo, water vapour, cloud, surface turbulent fluxes and atmospheric dynamics, reversed the patterns between the two periods. The changes in atmospheric heat transport are coupled with changes in the surface latent heat flux across the lower troposphere (below approximately 800 hPa) and with cloud-related processes in the upper troposphere (above approximately 600 hPa) and were underpinned by strengthening/weakening Hadley Circulation and Walker Circulation during the warming/hiatus period. This dynamical coupling experienced a phase transition between the two periods, reminding us of the importance of understanding the atmospheric footprint, which constitutes an essential part of internal climate variability. </TEXT>

A number of 'skeptics' and/or 'lukewarmers' have suggested that ECS should be even lower (this is essentially *why* they are 'lukewarmers'); however, those studies on which their claims rest heavily rely on the more recent instrumental data which are likely biased towards the low end (for example, as a result of the so-called, 'hiatus' a period of time which saw reduced rate of warming in the surface records). A number of studies, including this one, strongly suggest that ECS shows a positive feedback temperature dependence^[1](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015GL064240/abstract) .

<TEXT> This particular statement stands out to me, as a number of studies have recently suggested the following in regard to ECS:

*Based on optimal interpolation on the proxy records and by taking area-weighted means, we find that global tropical mean SSTs increased by 2.7C across the PETM and that the global mean SSTs increased by 5.3C, very close to previous estimates, but our estimate avoids the use of an intervening climate model. CESM1 has a modern equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3.2C per doubling of CO2, and we find a similar response of 3.5C for a doubling under Eocene conditions in our simulations. However, the global mean SST change is only 2.8C per doubling, indicating that the 3.5C global response reflects enhanced warming on land. Thus, a model with this sensitivity would require nearly two further doublings of CO2 (or equivalent forcing) to achieve a global mean SST increase of 5.3C, as implied by the data. The required carbon release would then be 10,000 gigametric tons (Gt) of carbon, which is in keeping with budgets from other climate models. These large carbon inputs and resulting CO2 values are unlikely and not supported by recent pCO2 (partial pressure of CO2) estimates. Hence, the most likely explanation is that the latest Paleocene equilibrium climate sensitivity was significantly larger than the models 3.2C, perhaps due to strongly increased sensitivity at higher temperature during the PETM, or non-CO2 changes in radiative balance were of importance in maintaining latest Paleocene warmth and enhancing PETM warming.*

I'd be curious to know how, if at all, the IPCC will adjust its ECS boundaries in its upcoming assessment report. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Extreme warmth and heat-stressed plankton in the tropics during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/3/e1600891.full)
___

**Abstract**

Global ocean temperatures rapidly warmed by ~5C during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; ~56 million years ago). Extratropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs) met or exceeded modern subtropical values. With these warm extratropical temperatures, climate models predict tropical SSTs 35Cnear upper physiological temperature limits for many organisms. However, few data are available to test these projected extreme tropical temperatures or their potential lethality. We identify the PETM in a shallow marine sedimentary section deposited in Nigeria.

___

**Abstract**

Global ocean temperatures rapidly warmed by ~5C during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; ~56 million years ago). Extratropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs) met or exceeded modern subtropical values. With these warm extratropical temperatures, climate models predict tropical SSTs 35Cnear upper physiological temperature limits for many organisms. However, few data are available to test these projected extreme tropical temperatures or their potential lethality. We identify the PETM in a shallow marine sedimentary section deposited in Nigeria. On the basis of planktonic foraminiferal Mg/Ca and oxygen isotope ratios and the molecular proxy TEX86, latest Paleocene equatorial SSTs were ~33C, and TEX86 indicates that SSTs rose to 36C during the PETM. This confirms model predictions on the magnitude of polar amplification and refutes the tropical thermostat theory. We attribute a massive drop in dinoflagellate abundance and diversity at peak warmth to thermal stress, showing that the base of tropical food webs is vulnerable to rapid warming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Excess of genomic defects in a woolly mammoth on Wrangel island](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006601)
___

**Abstract**

Woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) populated Siberia, Beringia, and North America during the Pleistocene and early Holocene. Recent breakthroughs in ancient DNA sequencing have allowed for complete genome sequencing for two specimens of woolly mammoths (Palkopoulou et al. 2015). One mammoth specimen is from a mainland population 45,000 years ago when mammoths were plentiful. The second, a 4300 yr old specimen, is derived from an isolated population on Wrangel island where mammoths subsisted with small effective population size more than 43-fold lower than previous populations. These extreme differences in effective population size offer a rare opportunity to test nearly neutral models of genome architecture evolution within a single species. Using these previously published mammoth sequences, we identify deletions, retrogenes, and non-functionalizing point mutations. In the Wrangel island mammoth, we identify a greater number of deletions, a larger proportion of deletions affecting gene sequences, a greater number of candidate retrogenes, and an increased number of premature stop codons. This accumulation of detrimental mutations is consistent with genomic meltdown in response to low effective population sizes in the dwindling mammoth population on Wrangel island. In addition, we observe high rates of loss of olfactory receptors and urinary proteins, either because these loci are non-essential or because they were favored by divergent selective pressures in island environments. Finally, at the locus of FOXQ1 we observe two independent loss-of-function mutations, which would confer a satin coat phenotype in this island woolly mammoth. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Ice-marginal glaciated landscapes demarcate former boundaries of the continental ice sheets. Throughout circumpolar regions, permafrost has preserved relict ground ice and glacigenic sediments, delaying the sequence of postglacial landscape change that transformed temperate environments millennia earlier. Here we show that within 7  10^6 km^2 of glaciated permafrost terrain, extensive landscapes remain poised for major climate-driven change. Across northwestern Canada, 60100-km-wide concentric swaths of thaw slumpaffected terrain delineate the maximum and recessional positions of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. These landscapes comprise 17% of continuous permafrost terrain in a 1.27  10^6 km^2 study area, indicating widespread preservation of late Pleistocene ground ice. These thaw slump, relict ground ice, and glacigenic terrain associations are also evident at the circumpolar scale. Recent intensification of thaw slumping across northwestern Canada has mobilized primary glacial sediments, triggering a cascade of fluvial, lacustrine, and coastal effects. These geologically significant processes, highlighted by the spatial distribution of thaw slumps and patterns of fluvial sediment mobilization, signal the climate-driven renewal of deglaciation and postglacial permafrost landscape evolution.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Increase in acidifying water in the western Arctic Ocean](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3228.html)
___

**Abstract**

The uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the ocean decreases seawater pH and carbonate mineral aragonite saturation state (arag), a process known as Ocean Acidification (OA). This can be detrimental to marine organisms and ecosystems. The Arctic Ocean is particularly sensitive to climate change and aragonite is expected to become undersaturated (arag  1) there sooner than in other oceans. However, the extent and expansion rate of OA in this region are still unknown. Here we show that, between the 1990s and 2010, low arag waters have expanded northwards at least 5, to 85 N, and deepened 100 m, to 250 m depth. Data from trans-western Arctic Ocean cruises show that arag  1 water has increased in the upper 250 m from 5% to 31% of the total area north of 70 N. Tracer data and model simulations suggest that increased Pacific Winter Water transport, driven by an anomalous circulation pattern and sea-ice retreat, is primarily responsible for the expansion, although local carbon recycling and anthropogenic CO2 uptake have also contributed. These results indicate more rapid acidification is occurring in the Arctic Ocean than the Pacific and Atlantic oceans with the western Arctic Ocean the first open-ocean region with large-scale expansion of acidified water directly observed in the upper water column. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Updated observational datasets without climatological infilling show that there was an increase in sea ice concentration in the Eastern Arctic between 1950 and 1975, contrary to earlier climatology in-filled observational datasets that show weak inter-annual variations during that time period. We here present climate model simulations showing that this observed sea ice concentration increase was primarily a consequence of cooling induced by increasing anthropogenic aerosols and natural forcing. Indeed, sulphur dioxide emissions, which lead to the formation of sulphate aerosols, peaked around 1980 causing a sharp increase in the burden of sulphate between the 1950s and 1970s; but since 1980, the burden has dropped. Our climate model simulations show that the cooling contribution of aerosols offset the warming effect of increasing greenhouse gases over the mid-twentieth century resulting in the expansion of the Arctic sea ice cover. These results challenge the perception that Arctic sea ice extent was unperturbed by human influence until the 1970s, suggesting instead that it exhibited earlier forced multi-decadal variations, with implications for our understanding of impacts and adaptation in human and natural Arctic systems. </TEXT>

[Summary](http://energy.anu.edu.au/files/Summary%20-%20100%25%20renewable%20electricity%20in%20Australia.pdf) (pdf)
___

**Abstract**

We present an energy balance analysis of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) in a 100% 
renewable energy scenario
 in which wind and photovoltaics (PV) provides 90% of the annual electricity
. 
The key outcome 
of our modelling 
is that the 
additional 
cost of balancing renewable 
energy
 supply
 with
demand 
on an hourly basis 
throughout the year is modest: AU$25
-30/MWh
 (US$19-
23/MWh)
.

In our modelling we avoid heroic assumptions about future technology development
 by only including 
technology that has already been deployed in large quantities ( 100 Gigawatts), namely PV, wind, high 
voltage 
transmission
 (HVDC, HVAC) and pumped hydro energy storage (PHES). 
PHES constitutes 97% of 
worldwide
 electricity storage but is neglected in many
 analyses.

In our scenarios wind and PV contributes about 9
0% of annual electricity, while existing hydroelectricity 
and biomass contributes about 10%. We use historical data for wind, sun and demand for every hour of 
the years 2006
-10.
 Very wide distribution of PV and wind reduces supply shortfalls by taking advantage 
of different weather systems.
 Energy balance between supply and demand is maintained by adding 
sufficient PHES, HVDC/HVAC and excess wind and PV capacity. We term the cost of these additions
 as 
the levelised cost of balancing (LCOB).
 LCOB plus
 the levelised cost of 
annual 
generation (LCOG), combine 
to give the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE).

Using 2016 prices prevailing in Australia, we estimate that LCOB is AU
$28
/MWh, 
LCOG is AU
$65/MWh 
and LCOE is 
AU
$93/MWh
.  This can be compared with the estimated LCOE from a new supercritical black 
coal power station in Australia of
 AU
$80/MWh
. Much of Australias coal power stations will need to be 
replaced over the next 15 years. LCOE 
of renewables 
is almost certain to decrease due to rapidly falling 
cost of wind and PV. With PV and wind in the price range of AU
$50/MWh, the LCOE of a balanced 100% 
renewable electricity system is around AU
$75/MWh.

Importantly, the LCOB calculated in this work is an upper bound
  we use 2016 prices and do not include 
demand management or
 batteries
. A large fraction of LCOB relates to periods of several successive days 
of overcast and windless weather that occur once every few years. Substantial reductions in LCOB are 
possible through contractual load shedding, the occasional use of legacy 
coal and g
as generators to 
charge 
PHES reservoirs, and management of the charging times of batteries in electric cars.
Although we have not modelled dynamical stability on a time scale of 
sub
-seconds to minutes we note 
that PHES can provide excellent inertial energy, spinning reserve, rapid start, black start capability, 
voltage regulation and frequency control. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Colluvium supply in humid regions limits the frequency of storm-triggered landslides](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep34438)
___

**Abstract**

Shallow landslides, triggered by extreme rainfall, are a significant hazard in mountainous landscapes. The hazard posed by shallow landslides depends on the availability and strength of colluvial material in landslide source areas and the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events. Here we investigate how the time taken to accumulate colluvium affects landslide triggering rate in the Southern Appalachian Mountains, USA and how this may affect future landslide hazards. We calculated the failure potential of 283 hollows by comparing colluvium depths to the minimum (critical) soil depth required for landslide initiation in each hollow. Our data show that most hollow soil depths are close to their critical depth, with 62% of hollows having soils that are too thin to fail. Our results, supported by numerical modeling, reveal that landslide frequency in many humid landscapes may be insensitive to projected changes in the frequency of intense rainfall events. </TEXT>

Globally, 2.3 million square kilometers of forest were lost during the 12-year study period and 0.8 million square kilometers of new forest were gained. The tropics exhibited both the greatest losses and the greatest gains (through regrowth and plantation), with losses outstripping gains.

**Abstract**

Climate change has been shown to impact the mean climate state and climate extremes. Though climate extremes have the potential to disrupt society, extreme conditions are rare by definition. In contrast, mild weather occurs frequently and many human activities are built around it. We provide a global analysis of mild weather based on simple criteria and explore changes in response to radiative forcing. We find a slight global mean decrease in the annual number of mild days projected both in the near future (4 days per year, 20162035) and at the end of this century (10 days per year, 20812100). Projected seasonal and regional redistributions of mild days are substantially greater. These changes are larger than the interannual variability of mild weather caused by El NioSouthern Oscillation. Finally, we show an observed global decrease in the recent past, and that observed regional changes in mild weather resemble projections. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's an important point to consider, however, due to relevant time scales. For example, if it takes ~30 years for a tree to reach maturity, you need to ask yourself how many trees can you burn during those three decades, what fraction is left behind as waste, and note that the underlying assumption suggesting that the carbon sink will recover by 100% through forest management, likely doesn't hold in all cases. This concept can be termed the "carbon payback period."

As the report states:

The many attempts that have been made to estimate carbon payback periods suggest that they vary substantially, from less than 20 years to many decades, and in some cases even centuries... It can be argued that the length of the carbon payback period does not matter as long as all emissions are eventually absorbed. This ignores, however, the potential impact in the short term on climate tipping points (a concept that is not yet proven but for which there is some evidence) and on the worlds ability to meet the 1.5C target set in the 2015 Paris Agreement, which requires greenhouse gas emissions to peak in the near term.  

Nothing is perfect, so it's important to study where such deficiencies reside in order to better manage these possible short comings. For example, noting the aforementioned, the study goes on to discuss accounting for biomass in policy:

...a tonne of emissions from burning biomass for energy does not count against a countrys emissions target but a tonne of emissions from fossil fuel energy sources does.

Quite clearly then, while there is an incentive to use biomass energy rather than fossil fuels in order to reduce a countrys greenhouse gas emissions, such a reduction is not necessarily real, as the emissions are still there, they just haven't been accounted for.

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Climate impacts on global hot spots of marine biodiversity](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/2/e1601198.full)
___

**Abstract**

Human activities drive environmental changes at scales that could potentially cause ecosystem collapses in the marine environment. We combined information on marine biodiversity with spatial assessments of the impacts of climate change to identify the key areas to prioritize for the conservation of global marine biodiversity. This process identified six marine regions of exceptional biodiversity based on global distributions of 1729 species of fish, 124 marine mammals, and 330 seabirds. Overall, these hot spots of marine biodiversity coincide with areas most severely affected by global warming. In particular, these marine biodiversity hot spots have undergone local to regional increasing water temperatures, slowing current circulation, and decreasing primary productivity. Furthermore, when we overlapped these hot spots with available industrial fishery data, albeit coarser than our estimates of climate impacts, they suggest a worrying coincidence whereby the worlds richest areas for marine biodiversity are also those areas mostly affected by both climate change and industrial fishing. In light of these findings, we offer an adaptable framework for determining local to regional areas of special concern for the conservation of marine biodiversity. This has exposed the need for finer-scaled fishery data to assist in the management of global fisheries if the accumulative, but potentially preventable, effect of fishing on climate change impacts is to be minimized within areas prioritized for marine biodiversity conservation. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

The pacing of glacialinterglacial cycles during the Quaternary period (the past 2.6 million years) is attributed to astronomically driven changes in high-latitude insolation. However, it has not been clear how astronomical forcing translates into the observed sequence of interglacials. Here we show that before one million years ago interglacials occurred when the energy related to summer insolation exceeded a simple threshold, about every 41,000 years. Over the past one million years, fewer of these insolation peaks resulted in deglaciation (that is, more insolation peaks were skipped), implying that the energy threshold for deglaciation had risen, which led to longer glacials. However, as a glacial lengthens, the energy needed for deglaciation decreases. A statistical model that combines these observations correctly predicts every complete deglaciation of the past million years and shows that the sequence of interglacials that has occurred is one of a small set of possibilities. The model accounts for the dominance of obliquity-paced glacialinterglacial cycles early in the Quaternary and for the change in their frequency about one million years ago. We propose that the appearance of larger ice sheets over the past million years was a consequence of an increase in the deglaciation threshold and in the number of skipped insolation peaks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Climate change is projected to have severe impacts on the frequency and intensity of peak electricity demand across the United States](http://www.pnas.org/content/114/8/1886)
___


**Significance**

The existing empirical literature on the impacts of climate change on the electricity sector has focused on changing electricity consumption patterns. In this paper, we show that incorporating impacts on the frequency and intensity of peak load consumption during hot days implies sizable required investments in peak generating capacity (or major advances in storage technology or the structure of electricity prices), which results in substantially larger impacts than those from just changes in overall consumption.

**Abstract**

It has been suggested that climate change impacts on the electric sector will account for the majority of global economic damages by the end of the current century and beyond [Rose S, et al. (2014) Understanding the Social Cost of Carbon: A Technical Assessment]. The empirical literature has shown significant increases in climate-driven impacts on overall consumption, yet has not focused on the cost implications of the increased intensity and frequency of extreme events driving peak demand, which is the highest load observed in a period. We use comprehensive, high-frequency data at the level of load balancing authorities to parameterize the relationship between average or peak electricity demand and temperature for a major economy. Using statistical models, we analyze multiyear data from 166 load balancing authorities in the United States. We couple the estimated temperature response functions for total daily consumption and daily peak load with 18 downscaled global climate models (GCMs) to simulate climate change-driven impacts on both outcomes. We show moderate and heterogeneous changes in consumption, with an average increase of 2.8% by end of century. The results of our peak load simulations, however, suggest significant increases in the intensity and frequency of peak events throughout the United States, assuming todays technology and electricity market fundamentals. As the electricity grid is built to endure maximum load, our findings have significant implications for the construction of costly peak generating capacity, suggesting additional peak capacity costs of up to 180 billion dollars by the end of the century under business-as-usual. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Ice-marginal glaciated landscapes demarcate former boundaries of the continental ice sheets. Throughout circumpolar regions, permafrost has preserved relict ground ice and glacigenic sediments, delaying the sequence of postglacial landscape change that transformed temperate environments millennia earlier. Here we show that within 7  10^6 km^2 of glaciated permafrost terrain, extensive landscapes remain poised for major climate-driven change. Across northwestern Canada, 60100-km-wide concentric swaths of thaw slumpaffected terrain delineate the maximum and recessional positions of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. These landscapes comprise 17% of continuous permafrost terrain in a 1.27  10^6 km^2 study area, indicating widespread preservation of late Pleistocene ground ice. These thaw slump, relict ground ice, and glacigenic terrain associations are also evident at the circumpolar scale. Recent intensification of thaw slumping across northwestern Canada has mobilized primary glacial sediments, triggering a cascade of fluvial, lacustrine, and coastal effects. These geologically significant processes, highlighted by the spatial distribution of thaw slumps and patterns of fluvial sediment mobilization, signal the climate-driven renewal of deglaciation and postglacial permafrost landscape evolution.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Modeling sustainability: population, inequality, consumption, and bidirectional coupling of the Earth and Human Systems](https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/nsr/nww081)
___

**Significance** 

The Human System has become strongly dominant within the Earth System in many different ways. However, in current models that explore the future of humanity and environment, and guide policy, key Human System variables, such as demographics, inequality, economic growth, and migration, are not coupled with the Earth System but are instead driven by exogenous estimates such as United Nations (UN) population projections. This makes the models likely to miss important feedbacks in the real EarthHuman system that may result in unexpected outcomes requiring very different policy interventions. The importance of humanity's sustainability challenges calls for collaboration of natural and social scientists to develop coupled EarthHuman system models for devising effective science-based policies and measures.

**Abstract**

Over the last two centuries, the impact of the Human System has grown dramatically, becoming strongly dominant within the Earth System in many different ways. Consumption, inequality, and population have increased extremely fast, especially since about 1950, threatening to overwhelm the many critical functions and ecosystems of the Earth System. Changes in the Earth System, in turn, have important feedback effects on the Human System, with costly and potentially serious consequences. However, current models do not incorporate these critical feedbacks. We argue that in order to understand the dynamics of either system, Earth System Models must be coupled with Human System Models through bidirectional couplings representing the positive, negative, and delayed feedbacks that exist in the real systems. In particular, key Human System variables, such as demographics, inequality, economic growth, and migration, are not coupled with the Earth System but are instead driven by exogenous estimates, such as United Nations population projections. This makes current models likely to miss important feedbacks in the real EarthHuman system, especially those that may result in unexpected or counterintuitive outcomes, and thus requiring different policy interventions from current models. The importance and imminence of sustainability challenges, the dominant role of the Human System in the Earth System, and the essential roles the Earth System plays for the Human System, all call for collaboration of natural scientists, social scientists, and engineers in multidisciplinary research and modeling to develop coupled EarthHuman system models for devising effective science-based policies and measures to benefit current and future generations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Palaeoclimate science: Pulsating ice sheet](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7641/full/542298a.html)
____

During the last ice age, huge numbers of icebergs were episodically discharged from an ice sheet that covered North America. Numerical modelling suggests that these events resulted from a conceptually simple feedback cycle.

Understanding abrupt changes in ice sheets and climate is a long-standing issue in palaeoclimate science. In the last glacial period, North America's Laurentide Ice Sheet episodically discharged large armadas of icebergs through the Hudson Strait into the North Atlantic. This expulsion of fresh water in the form of icebergs not only raised the global sea level by a few metres, but also weakened ocean circulation in the North Atlantic and therefore affected climate. The cause of these 'Heinrich events' remains hotly debated. Bassis et al. use an ice-sheet model to demonstrate that such events could have been triggered by relatively small fluctuations in subsurface ocean temperature  a result that has implications for the survival of present-day ice sheets.

Evidence for Heinrich events is found as distinct layers of coarse glacial debris in ocean-sediment records. Such particles were incorporated at the base of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, and were then transported with the discharged icebergs into the North Atlantic. After the icebergs melted, these particles accumulated on the ocean floor.

Heinrich events occurred every few thousand years during the glacial periods, but their interval and intensity varied. Interestingly, the timing of these events coincides with cold phases of DansgaardOeschger (DO) cycles  millennium-scale climate oscillations recorded in ice cores drilled in Greenland. Rapid ice-sheet decay during cold periods seems surprising, given present-day observations of warming and rapid glacier retreat in Greenland.

In the 1990s, a 'bingepurge' mechanism6 was proposed to explain Heinrich events. In this explanation, the Laurentide Ice Sheet slowly increased in mass by gradually accumulating ice (the 'binge' phase). When the ice was sufficiently thick, the base of the ice sheet reached its melting point. The subglacial sediment acted as a lubricant, causing the ice sheet to slide, become unstable and discharge icebergs at an enhanced rate (the 'purge' phase). Although this mechanism does not require the involvement of external factors such as climate change, it cannot explain the synchronization between Heinrich events and DO cycles.

Other explanations assume that a large, protruding ice shelf, situated between Canada and the southern tip of Greenland, buttressed the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Subsurface ocean warming during the cold phases of DO cycles, as revealed by proxy data, could then have melted and destabilized the ice shelf, triggering Heinrich events. However, the existence of a large ice shelf is incompatible with evidence of a mostly open ocean during the last glacial period. Moreover, the models that describe the ice-shelf collapse are poorly constrained.

Bassis and colleagues consider an alternative mechanism in which pulses of subsurface ocean warming act as an external trigger, but the existence of a large ice shelf is not required. The Laurentide Ice Sheet starts at its full extent, depressing the sill  a raised frontal section of the glacier bed  at the mouth of the Hudson Strait. A pulse of subsurface ocean warming of a few degrees then enhances iceberg calving. Because the glacier bed deepens upstream, this causes an unstable, rapid ice-sheet retreat in the form of a Heinrich event. The glacier bed gradually adjusts to the ice sheet's decreasing mass by rising,which reduces iceberg calving and elevates the sill, cutting off contact with the warm subsurface water. The ice sheet can then slowly advance to its full extent and the entire process is repeated, giving rise to a pulsating ice sheet.

The authors simulate Heinrich events generated by this mechanism using a numerical ice-sheet model. They find that their results are fully consistent with the observational record, in both timing and magnitude. Crucially, their events occur only for the ocean-warming pulses for which Heinrich events are actually observed. This implies that full ice-sheet recovery and subsequent depression of the sill are prerequisites for ocean warming to trigger a Heinrich event, and also control the interval between events.

A strength of the authors' model is that it is quantitative, physically based and includes the dominant dynamic processes and feedbacks expected for such ice sheets. Furthermore, although the model is simple, it is robust against a wide choice of model parameters. Nevertheless, future studies should certainly explore more-sophisticated models.

Bassis and colleagues' proposed mechanism relies on subsurface ocean warming, which is the factor that seems to drive today's dynamic mass loss from ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. However, it is not known to what extent glacier-bed adjustment preconditioned today's ice sheets for abrupt retreat. Bassis et al. focus on explaining Heinrich events and do not resolve the cause of ocean warming. Nor do the authors consider how freshwater flux from Heinrich events affects the global climate system. Answering these enigmatic questions in palaeoclimate science and understanding Heinrich events in the context of DO cycles would require the proposed mechanism to be integrated into coupled atmosphereocean-circulation models.

The authors' work is a reminder of the complexity and nonlinearity of ice-sheetclimate systems, showing how small perturbations can trigger extreme responses through feedback mechanisms. This is relevant for understanding the palaeoclimate, as well as for discussions on global warming, rapid ice-sheet retreat and future sea-level rise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Late Holocene droughts in the Fertile Crescent recorded in a speleothem from northern Iraq](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL071786/abstract)
___

**Abstract**

Droughts have had large impacts on past and present societies. High-resolution paleoclimate data are essential to place recent droughts in a meaningful historical context and to predict regional future changes with greater accuracy. Such records, however, are very scarce in the Middle East in general, and the Fertile Crescent in particular. Here we present a 2400 year long speleothem-based multiproxy record from Gejkar Cave in northern Iraq. Oxygen and carbon isotopes and magnesium are faithful recorders of effective moisture. The new Gejkar record not only shows that droughts in 19982000 and 20072010, which have been argued to be a contributing factor to Syrian civil war, were extreme compared to the current mean climate, but they were also superimposed on a long-term aridification trend that already started around or before 950 C.E. (Common Era). This long-term trend is not captured by tree ring records and climate models, emphasizing the importance of using various paleoclimate proxy data to evaluate and improve climate models and to correctly inform policy makers about future hydroclimatic changes in this drought-prone region. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Impact of tropical cyclones on modeled extreme wind-wave climate](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL071681/abstract)
___

**Abstract**

The effect of forcing wind resolution on the extremes of global wind-wave climate are investigated in numerical simulations. Forcing winds from the Community Atmosphere Model at horizontal resolutions of 1.0 and 0.25 are used to drive Wavewatch III. Differences in extreme wave height are found to manifest most strongly in tropical cyclone (TC) regions, emphasizing the need for high-resolution forcing in those areas. Comparison with observations typically show improvement in performance with increased forcing resolution, with a strong influence in the tail of the distribution, although simulated extremes can exceed observations. A simulation for the end of the 21st century under a RCP 8.5 type emission scenario suggests further increases in extreme wave height in TC regions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Abrupt cooling over the North Atlantic in modern climate models](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14375)
___

**Abstract**

Observations over the 20th century evidence no long-term warming in the subpolar North Atlantic (SPG). This region even experienced a rapid cooling around 1970, raising a debate over its potential reoccurrence. Here we assess the risk of future abrupt SPG cooling in 40 climate models from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Contrary to the long-term SPG warming trend evidenced by most of the models, 17.5% of the models (7/40) project a rapid SPG cooling, consistent with a collapse of the local deep-ocean convection. Uncertainty in projections is associated with the models varying capability in simulating the present-day SPG stratification, whose realistic reproduction appears a necessary condition for the onset of a convection collapse. This event occurs in 45.5% of the 11 models best able to simulate the observed SPG stratification. Thus, due to systematic model biases, the CMIP5 ensemble as a whole underestimates the chance of future abrupt SPG cooling, entailing crucial implications for observation and adaptation policy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Context is important here, so while I would suggest placing emphasis on the worst case scenario in some cases related to climate change, there are others that I would not for at least two reasons: 

(1) All the evidence points elsewhere. While it's important to consider these hypothesis and theories there has to be some evidence to support them if they're going to drive policy. In each of the scenarios outlined in the study, that evidence simply isn't robust, it's just not there; and, in my opinion decisions ought to be evidence based - not the contrary.

(2) Pragmatism. Regulation and policies have social and economic consequences. As an example, there is some degree of uncertainty regarding the equilibrium climate sensitivity value ([ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_sensitivity)). The current consensus value is roughly 3C, however, the more widely accepted range of values is between 1.5C - 4.5C with some estimates being exceptionally high - upwards of nearly 12C. The ECS tells us how much warming occurs for a doubling of atmospheric CO2. This is important, because it sets the stage for emissions targets (for example the [Paris Agreement](http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php)). Decarbonization efforts based on policy and regulations underlined by an estimated ECS value of 1.5C could therefore result in too little too late, should the actual value be 3C. Meanwhile, rapid decarbonization efforts based on policy and regulations underlined by the worst case scenario estimates of an ECS value upwards of 12C would result in social and economic catastrophe. The transition to decarbonization must be made as is quickly as can be done within reason.

Hopefully the above has highlighted why it's not always in the best interest to place emphasis on worst case scenarios, especially when they are not supported by strong evidence. Peoples lives will be impacted no matter the decision made, so it's important to reduce the negative impacts of those decisions, and the only way to do that is to ensure that those decisions, those regulations and policies, are based on the best available evidence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think I can properly address that question, I can only speculate about dissolved oxygen (DO). I'm not a biologist, but I would infer that more oxygen - though certainly to have *some* drawbacks - grossly speaking, would likely be more beneficial up to a certain limit.

As the worlds oceans and atmosphere are coupled to a good degree it may be beneficial to look for analogs during the late Palaeozoic, when atmospheric O2 may have been as high as ([35%](http://i.imgur.com/Nq0GEvK.jpg))^[1](http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/content/31/1/60) (in comparison, today's atmosphere is 21% O2). It's a rather large topic but I would recommend the following review paper with plenty of references to look into as well: [Evolution of oxygen utilization in multicellular organisms and implications for cell signalling in tissue engineering](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3258841/). </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lack of mixing can be attributed, in part, to a slowing ocean currents and has been noted by a number of studies^[1](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7640/full/nature21068.html), ^[2](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v5/n5/full/nclimate2554.html) . More specifically, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation appears to be slowing as a result of increasing meltwater from the Greenland Ice Sheet^[3](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016PA003014/abstract), ^[4](https://www.hakaimagazine.com/article-short/greenland-ice-melt-could-push-atlantic-circulation-collapse) . This can be further noted by observation of the '[cold blob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_blob_(North_Atlantic)' in the North Atlantic. 

Furthermore, warming waters result in stratification which prevents mixing between layers. This is all introductory material and can readily found online^[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation). For example, I would refer you to YaleCourses on Youtube under 'Atmosphere, Ocean and Environmental Change with Ron Smith' (playlist?list=PL902AF247F4163F61)
___

EDIT: To answer your question regarding other attributes the authors state the following in the paper:

"**Ventilation, overturning and consumption**

From our current understanding of the oceans, the oxygen loss in the deep oceans can have four origins. (a) A reduction of ventilation in deep convection regions, which would provide less ventilated waters in high latitudes, and a reduction of mixed layer subduction, mainly in mid and high latitudes. (b) A slowdown of meridional overturning circulation, which would reduce the amount of oxygenated waters that are mixed with older waters and thus increase the age of the deep waters in general. (c) An increase in biological activity in the upper ocean, with increased remineralization and thus oxygen consumption at depth. (d) Natural multi-decadal variability that is not captured by the data currently available.

While we cannot assign the observed changes to a sole origin, some are more likely than others. Reduced ventilation by deep convection is going to have a slow impact, since the oxygen-reduced waters will have to advect throughout the global basins before affecting older water masses. A reduction in deep convection that happens now might be observed in the tropical oceans in 50100 years, assuming no impact on overturning transports by a reduced deep water convection. On the other hand, a reduction of meridional overturning circulation (MOC) will be observed globally instantaneously, since a reduction of MOC reduces the push of oxygenated waters into areas deprived of oxygen. The last cause for accelerated oxygen decrease at depth is an increased remineralization, caused by enhanced biological activity. This would increase oxygen consumption throughout the water column, though decreasing with depth, since the Martin curve decreases close to exponentially." </TEXT>

**Abstract**

Recent studies indicate that the glaciers and ice caps in Queen Elizabeth Islands (QEI), Canada have experienced an increase in ice mass loss during the last two decades, but the contribution of ice dynamics to this loss is not well known. We present a comprehensive mapping of ice velocity using a suite of satellite data from year 1991 to 2015, combined with ice thickness data from NASA Operation IceBridge, to calculate ice discharge. We find that ice discharge increased significantly after 2011 in Prince of Wales Icefield, maintained or decreased in other sectors, whereas glacier surges have little impact on long-term trends in ice discharge. During 19912005, the QEI mass loss averaged 6.3  1.1 Gt yr^1 , 52% from ice discharge and the rest from surface mass balance (SMB). During 20052014, the mass loss from ice discharge averaged 3.5  0.2 Gt yr^1 (10%) versus 29.6  3.0 Gt yr^1 (90%) from SMB. SMB processes therefore dominate the QEI mass balance, with ice dynamics playing a significant role only in a few basins. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

In winter through early summer of 20142015, temperatures in the western U.S. were substantially enhanced due to a persistent high pressure ridge and warm water in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Concurrently, monthly averaged maximum daily 8-hour average (MDA8) O3 in June 2015 was enhanced by 313ppb across a large portion of the western U.S. At the Mt. Bachelor Observatory (2.8km asl) in central Oregon, O3 in June 2015 was enhanced by 11 ppbv compared to the long-term mean. Some urban areas had many days in June 2015 with MDA8 values above the current air quality threshold of 70 ppbv. We show that the high O3 was associated with enhanced temperatures, reduced cloud fraction, increased stagnation, and increased biogenic emissions. The data in June 2015 show enhanced O3/temperature slopes at several sites, compared to previous June data, due to these multiple factors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Heinrich events triggered by ocean forcing and modulated by isostatic adjustment](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7641/full/nature21069.html)
___

**Abstract**

During the last glacial period, the Laurentide Ice Sheet sporadically discharged huge numbers of icebergs through the Hudson Strait into the North Atlantic Ocean, leaving behind distinct layers of ice-rafted debris in the ocean sediments. Perplexingly, these massive discharge eventsHeinrich eventsoccurred during the cold portion of millennial-scale climate oscillations called DansgaardOeschger cycles. This is in contrast to the expectation that ice sheets expand in colder climates and shrink in warmer climates. Here we use an ice sheet model to show that the magnitude and timing of Heinrich events can be explained by the same processes that drive the retreat of modern marine-terminating glaciers. In our model, subsurface ocean warming associated with variations in the overturning circulation increases underwater melt along the calving face, triggering rapid margin retreat and increased iceberg discharge. On millennial timescales, isostatic adjustment causes the bed to uplift, isolating the terminus from subsurface warming and allowing the ice sheet to advance again until, at its most advanced position, it is poised for another Heinrich event. This mechanism not only explains the timing and magnitude of observed Heinrich events, but also suggests that ice sheets in contact with warming oceans may be vulnerable to catastrophic collapse even with little atmospheric warming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Decline in global oceanic oxygen content during the past five decades](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7641/full/nature21399.html)
___

**Abstract**

Ocean models predict a decline in the dissolved oxygen inventory of the global ocean of one to seven per cent by the year 2100, caused by a combination of a warming-induced decline in oxygen solubility and reduced ventilation of the deep ocean. It is thought that such a decline in the oceanic oxygen content could affect ocean nutrient cycles and the marine habitat, with potentially detrimental consequences for fisheries and coastal economies. Regional observational data indicate a continuous decrease in oceanic dissolved oxygen concentrations in most regions of the global ocean, with an increase reported in a few limited areas, varying by study. Prior work attempting to resolve variations in dissolved oxygen concentrations at the global scale reported a global oxygen loss of 550  130 teramoles (1012 mol) per decade between 100 and 1,000 metres depth based on a comparison of data from the 1970s and 1990s. Here we provide a quantitative assessment of the entire ocean oxygen inventory by analysing dissolved oxygen and supporting data for the complete oceanic water column over the past 50 years. We find that the global oceanic oxygen content of 227.4  1.1 petamoles (1015 mol) has decreased by more than two per cent (4.8  2.1 petamoles) since 1960, with large variations in oxygen loss in different ocean basins and at different depths. We suggest that changes in the upper water column are mostly due to a warming-induced decrease in solubility and biological consumption. Changes in the deeper ocean may have their origin in basin-scale multi-decadal variability, oceanic overturning slow-down and a potential increase in biological consumption. </TEXT>

Changes in the deeper ocean may have their origin in basin-scale multi-decadal variability, oceanic overturning slow-down and a potential increase in biological consumption. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [The Intermediate Complexity Atmospheric Research Model (ICAR) ](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JHM-D-15-0155.1)
___

**Abstract**

With limited computational resources, there is a need for computationally frugal models. This is particularly the case for atmospheric sciences, which have long relied on either simplistic analytical solutions or computationally expensive numerical models. The simpler solutions are inadequate for many problems, while the cost of numerical models makes their use impossible for many problems, most notably high-resolution climate downscaling applications spanning large areas, long time periods, and many global climate projections. Here the Intermediate Complexity Atmospheric Research model (ICAR) is presented to provide a new step along the modeling complexity continuum. ICAR leverages an analytical solution for high-resolution perturbations to wind velocities, in conjunction with numerical physics schemes, that is, advection and cloud microphysics, to simulate the atmosphere. The focus of the initial development of ICAR is for predictions of precipitation, and eventually temperature, humidity, and radiation at the land surface. Comparisons between ICAR and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model for simulations over an idealized mountain are presented, as well as among ICAR, WRF, and the Parameter-Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) observation-based product for a year-long simulation over the Colorado Rockies. In the ideal simulations, ICAR matches WRF precipitation predictions across a range of environmental conditions with a coefficient of determination r^2 of 0.92. In the Colorado Rockies, ICAR, WRF, and PRISM show very good agreement, with differences between ICAR and WRF comparable to the differences between WRF and PRISM in the cool season. For these simulations, WRF required 140800 times more computational resources than ICAR. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Regional cooling caused recent New Zealand glacier advances in a period of global warming](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14202)
___

**Abstract**

Glaciers experienced worldwide retreat during the twentieth and early twenty first centuries, and the negative trend in global glacier mass balance since the early 1990s is predominantly a response to anthropogenic climate warming. The exceptional terminus advance of some glaciers during recent global warming is thought to relate to locally specific climate conditions, such as increased precipitation. In New Zealand, at least 58 glaciers advanced between 1983 and 2008, and Franz Josef and Fox glaciers advanced nearly continuously during this time. Here we show that the glacier advance phase resulted predominantly from discrete periods of reduced air temperature, rather than increased precipitation. The lower temperatures were associated with anomalous southerly winds and low sea surface temperature in the Tasman Sea region. These conditions result from variability in the structure of the extratropical atmospheric circulation over the South Pacific. While this sequence of climate variability and its effect on New Zealand glaciers is unusual on a global scale, it remains consistent with a climate system that is being modified by humans. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

The dominant external forces influencing the rate of change of the Earth System have been astronomical and geophysical during the planets 4.5-billion-year existence. In the last six decades, anthropogenic forcings have driven exceptionally rapid rates of change in the Earth System. This new regime can be represented by an Anthropocene equation, where other forcings tend to zero, and the rate of change under human influence can be estimated. Reducing the risk of leaving the glacialinterglacial limit cycle of the late Quaternary for an uncertain future will require, in the first instance, the rate of change of the Earth System to become approximately zero.

<TEXT> Study: [Recent increase in oceanic carbon uptake driven by weaker upper-ocean overturning](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7640/full/nature21068.html)
___

**Abstract**

The ocean is the largest sink for anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), having absorbed roughly 40 per cent of CO2 emissions since the beginning of the industrial era. Recent data show that oceanic CO2 uptake rates have been growing over the past decade, reversing a trend of stagnant or declining carbon uptake during the 1990s. Here we show that ocean circulation variability is the primary driver of these changes in oceanic CO2 uptake over the past several decades. We use a global inverse model to quantify the mean ocean circulation during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, and then estimate the impact of decadal circulation changes on the oceanic CO2 sink using a carbon cycling model. We find that during the 1990s an enhanced upper-ocean overturning circulation drove increased outgassing of natural CO2, thus weakening the global CO2 sink. This trend reversed during the 2000s as the overturning circulation weakened. Continued weakening of the upper-ocean overturning is likely to strengthen the CO2 sink in the near future by trapping natural CO2 in the deep ocean, but ultimately may limit oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Is There a Stratospheric Pacemaker Controlling the Daily Cycle of Tropical Rainfall?](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL072549/abstract)
___

**Abstract**

Rainfall in the tropics exhibits a large, 12-hour sun-synchronous variation with coherent phase around the globe. A long-standing, but unproved, hypothesis for this phenomenon is excitation by the prominent 12-hour atmospheric tide, which itself is significantly forced remotely by solar heating of the stratospheric ozone layer. We investigated the relative roles of large-scale tidal forcing and more local effects in accounting for the 12-hour variation of tropical rainfall. A model of the atmosphere run with the diurnal cycle of solar heating artificially suppressed below the stratosphere still simulated a strong coherent 12-hour rainfall variation (~50% of control run), demonstrating that stratospherically-forced atmospheric tide propagates downward to the troposphere and contributes to the organization of large-scale convection. The results have implications for theories of excitation of tropical atmospheric waves by moist convection, for the evaluation of climate models, and for explaining the recently-discovered lunar tidal rainfall cycle. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

The Antarctic Circumpolar Current is the strongest current in the ocean and has a pivotal impact on ocean stratification, heat content, and carbon content. The circumpolar volume transport is relatively insensitive to surface wind forcing in models that resolve turbulent ocean eddies, a process termed eddy saturation. Here a simple model is presented that explains the physics of eddy saturation with three ingredients: a momentum budget, a relation between the eddy form stress and eddy energy, and an eddy energy budget. The model explains both the insensitivity of circumpolar volume transport to surface wind stress and the increase of eddy energy with wind stress. The model further predicts that circumpolar transport increases with increased bottom friction, a counterintuitive result that is confirmed in eddy-permitting calculations. These results suggest an unexpected and important impact of eddy energy dissipation, through bottom drag or lee wave generation, on ocean stratification, ocean heat content, and potentially atmospheric CO2. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Half-metre sea-level fluctuations on centennial timescales from mid-Holocene corals of Southeast Asia](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14387)
___

**Abstract**

Sea-level rise is a global problem, yet to forecast future changes, we must understand how and why relative sea level (RSL) varied in the past, on local to global scales. In East and Southeast Asia, details of Holocene RSL are poorly understood. Here we present two independent high-resolution RSL proxy records from Belitung Island on the Sunda Shelf. These records capture spatial variations in glacial isostatic adjustment and paleotidal range, yet both reveal a RSL history between 6850 and 6500cal years BP that includes two 0.6m fluctuations, with rates of RSL change reaching 134mm per year (2). Observations along the south coast of China, although of a lower resolution, reveal fluctuations similar in amplitude and timing to those on the Sunda Shelf. The consistency of the Southeast Asian records, from sites 2,600km apart, suggests that the records reflect regional changes in RSL that are unprecedented in modern times. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Humans have already increased the risk of major disruptions to Pacific rainfall](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14368)
___

**Abstract**

Intermittent disruptions to rainfall patterns and intensity over the Pacific Ocean lasting up to  1 year have major impacts on severe weather, agricultural production, ecosystems, and disease within the Pacific, and in many countries beyond. The frequency with which major disruptions to Pacific rainfall occur has been projected to increase over the 21st century, in response to global warming caused by large 21st century greenhouse gas emissions. Here we use the latest generation of climate models to show that humans may have contributed to the major disruption that occurred in the real world during the late 20th century. We demonstrate that although marked and sustained reductions in 21st century anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions can greatly moderate the likelihood of major disruption, elevated risk of occurrence appears locked in now, and for at least the remainder of the 21st century. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Clear decadal variations exist in the predictability of the El NioSouthern Oscillation (ENSO), with the most recent decade having the lowest ENSO predictability in the past six decades. The Bjerknes Feedback (BF) intensity, which dominates the development of ENSO, has been proposed to determine ENSO predictability. Here we demonstrate that decadal variations in BF intensity are largely a result of the sensitivity of the zonal winds to the zonal sea level pressure (SLP) gradient in the equatorial Pacific. Furthermore, the results show that during low-ENSO predictability decades, zonal wind anomalies over the equatorial Pacific are more linked to SLP variations in the off-equatorial Pacific, which can then transfer this information into surface temperature and precipitation fields through the BF, suggesting a weakening in the ocean-atmosphere coupling in the tropical Pacific. This result indicates that more attention should be paid to off-equatorial processes in the prediction of ENSO. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [The interaction of climate change and methane hydrates](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016RG000534/full)
___

**Abstract**

Gas hydrate, a frozen, naturally-occurring, and highly-concentrated form of methane, sequesters significant carbon in the global system and is stable only over a range of low-temperature and moderate-pressure conditions. Gas hydrate is widespread in the sediments of marine continental margins and permafrost areas, locations where ocean and atmospheric warming may perturb the hydrate stability field and lead to release of the sequestered methane into the overlying sediments and soils. Methane and methane-derived carbon that escape from sediments and soils and reach the atmosphere could exacerbate greenhouse warming. The synergy between warming climate and gas hydrate dissociation feeds a popular perception that global warming could drive catastrophic methane releases from the contemporary gas hydrate reservoir. Appropriate evaluation of the two sides of the climate-methane hydrate synergy requires assessing direct and indirect observational data related to gas hydrate dissociation phenomena and numerical models that track the interaction of gas hydrates/methane with the ocean and/or atmosphere. Methane hydrate is likely undergoing dissociation now on global upper continental slopes and on continental shelves that ring the Arctic Ocean. Many factorsthe depth of the gas hydrates in sediments, strong sediment and water column sinks, and the inability of bubbles emitted at the seafloor to deliver methane to the sea-air interface in most casesmitigate the impact of gas hydrate dissociation on atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations though. There is no conclusive proof that hydrate-derived methane is reaching the atmosphere now, but more observational data and improved numerical models will better characterize the climate-hydrate synergy in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Meltwater pulse recorded in Last Interglacial mollusk shells from Bermuda](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016PA003014/abstract)
___

**Abstract**

The warm climate of Bermuda today is modulated by the nearby presence of the Gulf Stream current. However, iceberg scours in the Florida Strait and the presence of ice-rafted debris in Bermuda Rise sediments indicate that, during the last deglaciation, icebergs discharged from the Laurentide Ice Sheet traveled as far south as subtropical latitudes. We present evidence that an event of similar magnitude affected the subtropics during the Last Interglacial, potentially due to melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Using the clumped isotope paleothermometer, we found temperatures ~10C colder and seawater 18O values ~2 lower than modern in Last Interglacial Cittarium pica shells from Grape Bay, Bermuda. In contrast, Last Interglacial shells from Rocky Bay, Bermuda, record temperatures only slightly colder and seawater 18O values similar to modern, likely representing more typical Last Interglacial conditions in Bermuda outside of a meltwater event. The significantly colder ocean temperatures observed in Grape Bay samples illustrate the extreme sensitivity of Bermudian climate to broad-scale ocean circulation changes. They indicate routine meltwater transport in the North Atlantic to near-equatorial latitudes, which would likely have resulted in disruption of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. These data demonstrate that future melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet, a potential source of the Last Interglacial meltwater event, could have dramatic climate effects outside of the high latitudes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're actually right on both accounts. It never happened, and the IPO was likely a contributor. The faux pause, otherwise known as the hiatus, was a reduced rate of warming measured in the global surface temperatures (land/atmosphere), but this is an incomplete picture because the oceans are the largest sink for thermal energy. The surface thermal energy (land/atmosphere) was effectively mixed into the ocean. Warming never actually slowed down when you account for the entire system; however, if you only look at one set of measurements and ignore the other available sets, of course it will look like a 'pause' in global warming, because you haven't accounted for the entire system. The following image should help place this into perspective: http://i.imgur.com/4tFZ4QG.jpg

It's important to note that it's not just NOAA that states that warming never slowed. Multiple other data sets agree, and NOAA actually shows *less* warming than some of the others: http://i.imgur.com/GTVAVTo.jpg </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's reasonable to say that while the effects may be felt more strongly in South West Pacific regions, the effects of the IPO are global in extent^[1](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v5/n6/full/nclimate2605.html), ^[2](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-015-2500-x), ^[3](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep12358)

A number of studies have recently been published suggesting that limiting increased warming to 2C relative to pre-industrial may be unattainable without stronger policies, rapid decarbonization, and  negative emissions through the implementation of carbon capture and storage (a technological and economical feat we have yet to achieve at appropriate scales), while others suggest 2C warming may already be locked in, depending on equilibrium climate sensitivity values.

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Prolonged silicon carbide integrated circuit operation in Venus surface atmospheric conditions](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4973429)
___

**Abstract**

The prolonged operation of semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs) needed for long-duration exploration of the surface of Venus has proven insurmountably challenging to date due to the  460 C,  9.4 MPa caustic environment. Past and planned Venus landers have been limited to a few hours of surface operation, even when IC electronics needed for basic lander operation are protected with heavily cumbersome pressure vessels and cooling measures. Here we demonstrate vastly longer (weeks) electrical operation of two silicon carbide (4H-SiC) junction field effect transistor (JFET) ring oscillator ICs tested with chips directly exposed (no cooling and no protective chip packaging) to a high-fidelity physical and chemical reproduction of Venus surface atmosphere. This represents more than 100-fold extension of demonstrated Venus environment electronics durability. With further technology maturation, such SiC IC electronics could drastically improve Venus lander designs and mission concepts, fundamentally enabling long-duration enhanced missions to the surface of Venus. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In general:

The IPO ... modulates regional temperature variability on a decadal time scale including the background of global warming trends. ... the IPO [also] modulates decadal precipitation trends, and it modulates the interannual response of temperature and precipitation to ENSO over the South West Pacific region. The most recent phase of the IPO has enhanced teleconnections with ENSO in some parts, and weakens them in other parts of the region.

 \- "[Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation and South Pacific climate](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.691/abstract;jsessionid=097EB7FFAF615FD36F3E646B8A096829.f04t01)" (open access)

You may also wish to read the following open access papers concerning the IPO:

- Drought variability in the eastern Australia and New Zealand summer drought atlas (ANZDA, CE 15002012) modulated by the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation^[1](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/12/124002)

- Relative influences of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation and ENSO on the South Pacific Convergence Zone^[2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2001GL014201/full)

A general summary concerning the IPO can be found here: http://climatology.co.uk/interdecadal-pacific-oscillation

The paper suggests that we may be transitioning to a positive phase IPO (represented [here](http://i.imgur.com/XEo571a.jpg) by the smoothed line)^[3](https://www.longpaddock.qld.gov.au/products/australiasvariableclimate/), ^[4](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/timeseries/IPOTPI/), ^[5](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/)  

As the IPO modulates ENSO, as described above, a negative phase would tend to reduce overall warming trends.

As for the implications with regard to 1.5C warming above pre-industrial, I can't say.

There's an old saying... there's no such thing as stupid questions, just stupid people ;) Hope I was able to help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Initialized decadal prediction for transition to positive phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11718)
___

**Abstract**

The negative phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), a dominant mode of multi-decadal variability of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Pacific, contributed to the reduced rate of global surface temperature warming in the early 2000s. A proposed mechanism for IPO multidecadal variability indicates that the presence of decadal timescale upper ocean heat content in the off-equatorial western tropical Pacific can provide conditions for an interannual El Nio/Southern Oscillation event to trigger a transition of tropical Pacific SSTs to the opposite IPO phase. Here we show that a decadal prediction initialized in 2013 simulates predicted Nio3.4 SSTs that have qualitatively tracked the observations through 2015. The year three to seven average prediction (20152019) from the 2013 initial state shows a transition to the positive phase of the IPO from the previous negative phase and a resumption of larger rates of global warming over the 20132022 period consistent with a positive IPO phase. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Timing and tempo of the Great Oxidation Event](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/01/31/1608824114.full)
___

**Significance**

We present U-Pb ages for the extensive Ongeluk large igneous province, a large-scale magmatic event that took place near the equator in the Paleoproterozoic Transvaal basin of southern Africa at ca. 2,426 Ma. This magmatism also dates the oldest Paleoproterozoic global glaciation and the onset of significant atmospheric oxygenation. This result forces a significant reinterpretation of the iconic Transvaal basin stratigraphy and implies that the oxygenation involved several oscillations in oxygen levels across 105 present atmospheric levels before the irreversible oxygenation of the atmosphere. Data also indicate that the Paleoproterozoic glaciations and oxygenation were ushered in by assembly of a large continental mass, extensive magmatism, and continental migration to near-equatorial latitudes, mirroring a similar chain of events in the Neoproterozoic.

**Abstract**

The first significant buildup in atmospheric oxygen, the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), began in the early Paleoproterozoic in association with global glaciations and continued until the end of the Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion ca. 2,060 Ma. The exact timing of and relationships among these events are debated because of poor age constraints and contradictory stratigraphic correlations. Here, we show that the first Paleoproterozoic global glaciation and the onset of the GOE occurred between ca. 2,460 and 2,426 Ma, 100 My earlier than previously estimated, based on an age of 2,426  3 Ma for Ongeluk Formation magmatism from the Kaapvaal Craton of southern Africa. This age helps define a key paleomagnetic pole that positions the Kaapvaal Craton at equatorial latitudes of 11  6 at this time. Furthermore, the rise of atmospheric oxygen was not monotonic, but was instead characterized by oscillations, which together with climatic instabilities may have continued over the next 200 My until 2,2502,240 Ma. Ongeluk Formation volcanism at ca. 2,426 Ma was part of a large igneous province (LIP) and represents a waning stage in the emplacement of several temporally discrete LIPs across a large low-latitude continental landmass. These LIPs played critical, albeit complex, roles in the rise of oxygen and in both initiating and terminating global glaciations. This series of events invites comparison with the Neoproterozoic oxygen increase and Sturtian Snowball Earth glaciation, which accompanied emplacement of LIPs across supercontinent Rodinia, also positioned at low latitude. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Impact of pre-Columbian geoglyph builders on Amazonian forests](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/01/31/1614359114.abstract)
___

**Significance**

Amazonian rainforests once thought to be pristine wildernesses are increasingly known to have been inhabited by large populations before European contact. How and to what extent these societies impacted their landscape through deforestation and forest management is still controversial, particularly in the vast interfluvial uplands that have been little studied. In Brazil, the groundbreaking discovery of hundreds of geometric earthworks by modern deforestation would seem to imply that this region was also deforested to a large extent in the past, challenging the apparent vulnerability of Amazonian forests to human land use. We reconstructed environmental evidence from the geoglyph region and found that earthworks were built within man-made forests that had been previously managed for millennia. In contrast, long-term, regional-scale deforestation is strictly a modern phenomenon.

**Abstract**

Over 450 pre-Columbian (pre-AD 1492) geometric ditched enclosures (geoglyphs) occupy 13,000 km^2 of Acre state, Brazil, representing a key discovery of Amazonian archaeology. These huge earthworks were concealed for centuries under terra firme (upland interfluvial) rainforest, directly challenging the pristine status of this ecosystem and its perceived vulnerability to human impacts. We reconstruct the environmental context of geoglyph construction and the nature, extent, and legacy of associated human impacts. We show that bamboo forest dominated the region for 6,000 y and that only small, temporary clearings were made to build the geoglyphs; however, construction occurred within anthropogenic forest that had been actively managed for millennia. In the absence of widespread deforestation, exploitation of forest products shaped a largely forested landscape that survived intact until the late 20th century.

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Spatial heterogeneity of climate change as an experiential basis for skepticism](http://www.eenews.net/assets/2016/12/20/document_cw_02.pdf) (pdf)
___


**Significance**

We develop a simple heuristic to measure local changes in climate based on the timing of record high and low temperatures. The metric shows local cooling and warming in the United States and captures two aspects of experiential learning that influence how the public perceives a change in climate: recency weighting and an emphasis on extreme events. We find that skepticism about whether the Earth is warming is greater in areas exhibiting cooling relative to areas that have warmed and that recent cooling can offset historical warming. This experiential basis for skepticism of climate change identifies obstacles to communicating ongoing changes in climate to the public and how these communications might be improved.

**Abstract**

We postulate that skepticism about climate change is partially caused by the spatial heterogeneity of climate change, which exposes experiential learners to climate heuristics that differ from the global average. This hypothesis is tested by formalizing an index that measures local changes in climate using station data and comparing this index with survey-based model estimates of county-level opinion about whether global warming is happening. Results indicate that more stations exhibit cooling and warming than predicted by random chance and that spatial variations in these changes can account for spatial variations in the percentage of the population that believes that global warming is happening. This effect is diminished in areas that have experienced more record low temperatures than record highs since 2005. Together, these results suggest that skepticism about climate change is driven partially by personal experiences; an accurate heuristic for local changes in climate identifies obstacles to communicating ongoing changes in climate to the public and how these communications might be improved. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Siberian Arctic black carbon sources constrained by model and observation](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/01/24/1613401114)
___

**Significance**

A successful mitigation strategy for climate warming agents such as black carbon (BC) requires reliable source information from bottom-up emission inventory data, which can only be verified by observation. We measured BC in one of the fastest-warming and, at the same time, substantially understudied regions on our planet, the northeastern Siberian Arctic. Our observations, compared with an atmospheric transport model, imply that quantification and spatial allocation of emissions at high latitudes, specifically in the Russian Arctic, need improvement by reallocating emissions and significantly shifting source contributions for the transport, domestic, power plant, and gas flaring sectors. This strong shift in reported emissions has potentially considerable implications for climate modeling and BC mitigation efforts.

**Abstract**

Black carbon (BC) in haze and deposited on snow and ice can have strong effects on the radiative balance of the Arctic. There is a geographic bias in Arctic BC studies toward the Atlantic sector, with lack of observational constraints for the extensive Russian Siberian Arctic, spanning nearly half of the circum-Arctic. Here, 2 y of observations at Tiksi (East Siberian Arctic) establish a strong seasonality in both BC concentrations (8 ngm^3 to 302 ngm^3 ) and dual-isotopeconstrained sources (19 to 73% contribution from biomass burning). Comparisons between observations and a dispersion model, coupled to an anthropogenic emissions inventory and a fire emissions inventory, give mixed results. In the European Arctic, this model has proven to simulate BC concentrations and source contributions well. However, the model is less successful in reproducing BC concentrations and sources for the Russian Arctic. Using a Bayesian approach, we show that, in contrast to earlier studies, contributions from gas flaring (6%), power plants (9%), and open fires (12%) are relatively small, with the major sources instead being domestic (35%) and transport (38%). The observation-based evaluation of reported emissions identifies errors in spatial allocation of BC sources in the inventory and highlights the importance of improving emission distribution and source attribution, to develop reliable mitigation strategies for efficient reduction of BC impact on the Russian Arctic, one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

<TEXT> Study: [Transient climate and ambient health impacts due to national solid fuel cookstove emissions](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/01/17/1612430114)
___


**Significance**

Widespread use of solid fuels for cooking results in a significant source of anthropogenic emissions. Of foremost concern for indoor air quality, reductions to these emissions could also impact both climate and ambient air quality. These potential cobenefits are appealing to efforts aimed at reducing cookstove emissions on national to urban scales, but have yet to be comprehensively evaluated at these scales. We thus estimate the per cookstove impacts on ambient air quality and global mean surface temperature for every individual country with significant cookstove use, considering reductions to both aerosols and long-lived greenhouse gases over the next century. This estimation provides information for policy makers evaluating climate and ambient air quality cobenefits of cookstove intervention programs worldwide.

**Abstract**

Residential solid fuel use contributes to degraded indoor and ambient air quality and may affect global surface temperature. However, the potential for national-scale cookstove intervention programs to mitigate the latter issues is not yet well known, owing to the spatial heterogeneity of aerosol emissions and impacts, along with coemitted species. Here we use a combination of atmospheric modeling, remote sensing, and adjoint sensitivity analysis to individually evaluate consequences of a 20-y linear phase-out of cookstove emissions in each country with greater than 5mml:mathmml:mo%/mml:mo/mml:math% of the population using solid fuel for cooking. Emissions reductions in China, India, and Ethiopia contribute to the largest global surface temperature change in 2050 [combined impact of 37 mK (11 mK to 85 mK)], whereas interventions in countries less commonly targeted for cookstove mitigation such as Azerbaijan, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan have the largest per cookstove climate benefits. Abatement in China, India, and Bangladesh contributes to the largest reduction of premature deaths from ambient air pollution, preventing 198,000 (102,000204,000) of the 260,000 (137,000268,000) global annual avoided deaths in 2050, whereas again emissions in Ukraine and Azerbaijan have the largest per cookstove impacts, along with Romania. Global cookstove emissions abatement results in an average surface temperature cooling of 77 mK (20 mK to 278 mK) in 2050, which increases to 118 mK (11 mK to 335 mK) by 2100 due to delayed CO2 response. Health impacts owing to changes in ambient particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 mml:mathmml:mi/mml:mi/mml:mathm or less (PM2.5) amount to 22.5 million premature deaths prevented between 2000 and 2100.

___


**Significance**

The magnitude, rate, and extent of past and future East Asian monsoon (EAM) rainfall fluctuations remain unresolved. Here, we present a rainfall reconstruction based on the surface area of a closed-basin lake located at the modern northwestern boundary of the EAM. Our record shows that fluctuations of EAM intensity and spatial extent covaried over the past 125 ka. This record contributes to the resolution of a current controversy concerning the response of the EAM to external climatic forcings. We propose that a substantial decrease in rainfall at 5.5 ka was a major factor leading to a large cultural collapse of the Early Neolithic culture in north China.

**Abstract**

The magnitude, rate, and extent of past and future East Asian monsoon (EAM) rainfall fluctuations remain unresolved. Here, late PleistoceneHolocene EAM rainfall intensity is reconstructed using a well-dated northeastern China closed-basin lake area record located at the modern northwestern fringe of the EAM. The EAM intensity and northern extent alternated rapidly between wet and dry periods on time scales of centuries. Lake levels were 60 m higher than present during the early and middle Holocene, requiring a twofold increase in annual rainfall, which, based on modern rainfall distribution, requires a 400 km northward expansion/migration of the EAM. The lake record is highly correlated with both northern and southern Chinese cave deposit isotope records, supporting rainfall intensity based interpretations of these deposits as opposed to an alternative water vapor sourcing interpretation. These results indicate that EAM intensity and the northward extent covary on orbital and millennial timescales. The termination of wet conditions at 5.5 ka BP (35 m lake drop) triggered a large cultural collapse of Early Neolithic cultures in north China, and possibly promoted the emergence of complex societies of the Late Neolithic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Elevation alters ecosystem properties across temperate treelines globally](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7639/full/nature21027.html)
___

**Abstract**

Temperature is a primary driver of the distribution of biodiversity as well as of ecosystem boundaries. Declining temperature with increasing elevation in montane systems has long been recognized as a major factor shaping plant community biodiversity, metabolic processes, and ecosystem dynamics. Elevational gradients, as thermoclines, also enable prediction of long-term ecological responses to climate warming. One of the most striking manifestations of increasing elevation is the abrupt transitions from forest to treeless alpine tundra. However, whether there are globally consistent above- and belowground responses to these transitions remains an open question. To disentangle the direct and indirect effects of temperature on ecosystem properties, here we evaluate replicate treeline ecotones in seven temperate regions of the world. We find that declining temperatures with increasing elevation did not affect tree leaf nutrient concentrations, but did reduce ground-layer community-weighted plant nitrogen, leading to the strong stoichiometric convergence of ground-layer plant community nitrogen to phosphorus ratios across all regions. Further, elevation-driven changes in plant nutrients were associated with changes in soil organic matter content and quality (carbon to nitrogen ratios) and microbial properties. Combined, our identification of direct and indirect temperature controls over plant communities and soil properties in seven contrasting regions suggests that future warming may disrupt the functional properties of montane ecosystems, particularly where plant community reorganization outpaces treeline advance. </TEXT>

**Abstract**

The instability and accelerated melting of the Antarctic Ice Sheet are among the foremost elements of contemporary global climate change. The increased freshwater output from Antarctica is important in determining sea level rise, the fate of Antarctic sea ice and its effect on the Earths albedo, ongoing changes in global deep-ocean ventilation, and the evolution of Southern Ocean ecosystems and carbon cycling. A key uncertainty in assessing and predicting the impacts of Antarctic Ice Sheet melting concerns the vertical distribution of the exported meltwater. This is usually represented by climate-scale models as a near-surface freshwater input to the ocean, yet measurements around Antarctica reveal the meltwater to be concentrated at deeper levels. Here we use observations of the turbulent properties of the meltwater outflows from beneath a rapidly melting Antarctic ice shelf to identify the mechanism responsible for the depth of the meltwater. We show that the initial ascent of the meltwater outflow from the ice shelf cavity triggers a centrifugal overturning instability that grows by extracting kinetic energy from the lateral shear of the background oceanic flow. The instability promotes vigorous lateral export, rapid dilution by turbulent mixing, and finally settling of meltwater at depth. We use an idealized ocean circulation model to show that this mechanism is relevant to a broad spectrum of Antarctic ice shelves. Our findings demonstrate that the mechanism producing meltwater at depth is a dynamically robust feature of Antarctic melting that should be incorporated into climate-scale models. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Global solar wind variations over the last four centuries](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep41548)
___

**Abstract**

The most recent grand minimum of solar activity, the Maunder minimum (MM, 16501710), is of great interest both for understanding the solar dynamo and providing insight into possible future heliospheric conditions. Here, we use nearly 30 years of output from a data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic model of the solar corona to calibrate heliospheric reconstructions based solely on sunspot observations. Using these empirical relations, we produce the first quantitative estimate of global solar wind variations over the last 400 years. Relative to the modern era, the MM shows a factor 2 reduction in near-Earth heliospheric magnetic field strength and solar wind speed, and up to a factor 4 increase in solar wind Mach number. Thus solar wind energy input into the Earths magnetosphere was reduced, resulting in a more Jupiter-like system, in agreement with the dearth of auroral reports from the time. The global heliosphere was both smaller and more symmetric under MM conditions, which has implications for the interpretation of cosmogenic radionuclide data and resulting total solar irradiance estimates during grand minima. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Ten years ago, Nobel laureate Paul Crutzen called for research into the possibility of reflecting sunlight away from Earth by injecting sulfur particles into the stratosphere. Across academic disciplines, Crutzen's intervention caused a surge in interest in and research on proposals for what is often referred to as geoengineering - an unbounded set of heterogeneous proposals for intentionally intervening into the climate system to reduce the risks of climate change. To mark the 10 year anniversary of the publication of Paul Crutzen's seminal essay, this special issue reviews the developments in geoengineering research since Crutzen's intervention and reflects upon possible future directions that geoengineering research may take. In this introduction, we briefly outline the arguments made in Paul Crutzen's 2006 contribution and describe the key developments of the past 10 years. We then proceed to give an overview of some of the central issues in current discussions on geoengineering, and situate the contributions to this special issue within them. In particular, we contend that geoengineering research is characterized by an orientation toward speculative futures that fundamentally shapes how geoengineering is entering the collective imagination of scientists, policymakers, and publics, and a mode of knowledge production that recognizes the risks which may result from new knowledge and that struggles with its own socio-political dimensions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (pdf): [Projections and Uncertainties About Climate Change in an Era of Minimal Climate Policies](http://cowles.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/pub/d20/d2057.pdf)
___

**Abstract**

Climate change remains one of the major international environmental challenges facing nations. Yet nations have to date taken minimal policies to slow climate change. Moreover, there has been no major improvement in emissions trends as of the latest data. The current study uses the updated DICE model to present new projections and the impacts of alternative climate policies. It also presents a new set of estimates of the uncertainties about future climate change and compares the results will those of other integrated assessment models. The study confirms past estimates of likely rapid climate change over the next century if there are not major climate-change policies. It suggests that it will be extremely difficult to achieve the 2C target of international agreements even if ambitious policies are introduced in the near term. The required carbon price needed to achieve current targets has risen over time as policies have been delayed.  </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Microalgae represent a promising source of renewable biomass for the production of biofuels and valuable chemicals. However, energy efficient cultivation and harvesting technologies are necessary to improve economic viability. A Tris-Acetate-Phosphate-Pluronic (TAPP) medium that undergoes a thermoreversible sol-gel transition is developed to efficiently culture and harvest microalgae without affecting the productivity as compared to that in traditional culture in a well-mixed suspension. After seeding microalgae in the TAPP medium in a solution phase at 15C, the temperature is increased by 7C to induce gelation. Within the gel, microalgae are observed to grow in large clusters rather than as isolated cells. The settling velocity of the microalgal clusters is approximately ten times larger than that of individual cells cultured in typical solution media. Such clusters are easily harvested gravimetrically by decreasing the temperature to bring the medium to a solution phase. </TEXT>

**Abstract**

Existing bottom-up emission inventories of methane from global oil and gas systems do not satisfactorily explain year-on-year variation in atmospheric methane estimated by top-down models. Using a novel bottom-up approach this study quantifies and attributes methane and ethane emissions from global oil and gas production from 1980 to 2012. Country-specific information on associated gas flows from published sources are combined with inter-annual variations in observed flaring of associated gas from satellite images from 1994 to 2010, to arrive at country-specific annual estimates of methane and ethane emissions from flows of associated gas. Results confirm trends from top-down models and indicate considerably higher methane and ethane emissions from oil production than previously shown in bottom-up inventories for this time period. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Ocean acidification alters predator behaviour and reduces predation rate](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/13/2/20160797)
___

**Abstract**

Ocean acidification poses a range of threats to marine invertebrates; however, the emerging and likely widespread effects of rising carbon dioxide (CO2) levels on marine invertebrate behaviour are still little understood. Here, we show that ocean acidification alters and impairs key ecological behaviours of the predatory cone snail Conus marmoreus. Projected near-future seawater CO2 levels (975 atm) increased activity in this coral reef molluscivore more than threefold (from less than 4 to more than 12 mm min^1 ) and decreased the time spent buried to less than one-third when compared with the present-day control conditions (390 atm). Despite increasing activity, elevated CO2 reduced predation rate during predatorprey interactions with control-treated humpbacked conch, Gibberulus gibberulus gibbosus; 60% of control predators successfully captured and consumed their prey, compared with only 10% of elevated CO2 predators. The alteration of key ecological behaviours of predatory invertebrates by near-future ocean acidification could have potentially far-reaching implications for predatorprey interactions and trophic dynamics in marine ecosystems. Combined evidence that the behaviours of both species in this predatorprey relationship are altered by elevated CO2 suggests food web interactions and ecosystem structure will become increasingly difficult to predict as ocean acidification advances over coming decades. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Global projections of river flood risk in a warmer world](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016EF000485/full)
___

**Abstract**

Rising global temperature has put increasing pressure on understanding the linkage between atmospheric warming and the occurrence of natural hazards. While the Paris Agreement has set the ambitious target to limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels, scientists are urged to explore scenarios for different warming thresholds and quantify ranges of socio-economic impact. In this work, we present a framework to estimate the economic damage and population affected by river floods at global scale. It is based on a modeling cascade involving hydrological, hydraulic and socio-economic impact simulations, and makes use of state-of-the-art global layers of hazard, exposure and vulnerability at 1 km grid resolution. An ensemble of seven high-resolution global climate projections based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 8.5 is used to derive streamflow simulations in the present and in the future climate. Those were analyzed to assess the frequency and magnitude of river floods and their impacts under scenarios corresponding to 1.5C, 2C, and 4C global warming. Results indicate a clear positive correlation between atmospheric warming and future flood risk at global scale. At 4C global warming, countries representing more than 70% of the global population and global GDP will face increases in flood risk in excess of 500%. Changes in flood risk are unevenly distributed, with the largest increases in Asia, America and Europe. In contrast, changes are statistically not significant in most countries in Africa and Oceania for all considered warming levels. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Climate change reduces extent of temperate drylands and intensifies drought in deep soils](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14196)
___

**Abstract**

Drylands cover 40% of the global terrestrial surface and provide important ecosystem services. While drylands as a whole are expected to increase in extent and aridity in coming decades, temperature and precipitation forecasts vary by latitude and geographic region suggesting different trajectories for tropical, subtropical, and temperate drylands. Uncertainty in the future of tropical and subtropical drylands is well constrained, whereas soil moisture and ecological droughts, which drive vegetation productivity and composition, remain poorly understood in temperate drylands. Here we show that, over the twenty first century, temperate drylands may contract by a third, primarily converting to subtropical drylands, and that deep soil layers could be increasingly dry during the growing season. These changes imply major shifts in vegetation and ecosystem service delivery. Our results illustrate the importance of appropriate drought measures and, as a global study that focuses on temperate drylands, highlight a distinct fate for these highly populated areas. </TEXT>

**Abstract**

Current emission pledges to the Paris Agreement appear insufficient to hold the global average temperature increase to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels. Yet, details are missing on how to track progress towards the Paris goal, inform the five-yearly global stocktake, and increase the ambition of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). We develop a nested structure of key indicators to track progress through time. Global emissions track aggregated progress1, country-level decompositions track emerging trends that link directly to NDCs, and technology diffusion indicates future reductions. We find the recent slowdown in global emissions growth is due to reduced growth in coal use since 2011, primarily in China and secondarily in the United States. The slowdown is projected to continue in 2016, with global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry similar to the 2015 level of 36 GtCO2. Explosive and policy-driven growth in wind and solar has contributed to the global emissions slowdown, but has been less important than economic factors and energy efficiency. We show that many key indicators are currently broadly consistent with emission scenarios that keep temperatures below 2 C, but the continued lack of large-scale carbon capture and storage threatens 2030 targets and the longer-term Paris ambition of net-zero emissions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Historical carbon dioxide emissions caused by land-use changes are possibly larger than assumed](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2882.html)
___

**Abstract**

The terrestrial biosphere absorbs about 20% of fossil-fuel CO2 emissions. The overall magnitude of this sink is constrained by the difference between emissions, the rate of increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and the ocean sink. However, the land sink is actually composed of two largely counteracting fluxes that are poorly quantified: fluxes from land-use change and CO2 uptake by terrestrial ecosystems. Dynamic global vegetation model simulations suggest that CO2 emissions from land-use change have been substantially underestimated because processes such as tree harvesting and land clearing from shifting cultivation have not been considered. As the overall terrestrial sink is constrained, a larger net flux as a result of land-use change implies that terrestrial uptake of CO2 is also larger, and that terrestrial ecosystems might have greater potential to sequester carbon in the future. Consequently, reforestation projects and efforts to avoid further deforestation could represent important mitigation pathways, with co-benefits for biodiversity. It is unclear whether a larger land carbon sink can be reconciled with our current understanding of terrestrial carbon cycling. Our possible underestimation of the historical residual terrestrial carbon sink adds further uncertainty to our capacity to predict the future of terrestrial carbon uptake and losses. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To answer your question without researching each specific event (each event tends to have a unique set of conditions that may vary slightly from other in order, magnitude, etc.), I'll have to resort to broad generalities. Like the trigger to an El Nio event (Bjerknes mechanism) there are numerous feedbacks loops in the climate system; however, I need to stipulate that the loop can be entered by an initial perturbation in any part of the system, and the feedback will cause amplification. In general, variations in Earth's orbital parameters initiate the onset of warming. As the planet slowly warms, a warmer and better-mixed ocean releases CO2 into the atmosphere, which amplifies the warming that is already in progress. CO2 was not the initial cause of deglaciation, it merely amplified the warming that was already in progress. As this article suggests, the hemispheric dichotomy plays an important role in modulating atmospheric CO2. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere depends on how efficiently the water from the deep ocean can return to the surface. Deep waters primarily return to the surface around Antarctica so during glacial conditions growth of Antarctic sea ice could prevent much of the CO2 in the surfacing deep waters from returning to the atmosphere, and thereby lowering atmospheric CO2 concentrations. 

It's not a very simple picture, often complicated by the numerous feedbacks, initial conditions, and tipping points. For example, as the article notes the Earth was simply too warm prior to 1 million years ago so the obliquity cycle dominated the global temperature signature. Afterwards, however, when the Earth cooled, the obliquity signal started to take a back seat and the precession/eccentricity signal began to dominate the global temperature signature - all modulated by the extent of Antarctic sea ice.

It's important to note that the climate signal is no longer dominated by natural variations, but rather by human emissions and land use practices. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your analogy is woefully misleading as we have accounted for 'the larger wealthier Chinese empire existing at the same time.' 

In fact, that's how we know the MWP was not a global phenomena as I previously stated:

At multi-decadal to centennial scales, temperature variability shows distinctly different regional patterns, with more similarity within each hemisphere than between them. There were no globally synchronous multi-decadal warm or cold intervals that define a worldwide Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age, but all reconstructions show generally cold conditions between ad 1580 and 1880, punctuated in some regions by warm decades during the eighteenth century.

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Mitigation implications of an ice-free summer in the Arctic Ocean](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016EF000429/full)
___

**Abstract**

The rapid loss of sea ice in the Arctic is one of the most striking manifestations of climate change. As sea ice melts, more open water is exposed to solar radiation, absorbing heat and generating a sea-icealbedo feedback that reinforces Arctic warming. Recent studies stress the significance of this feedback mechanism and suggest that ice-free summer conditions in the Arctic Ocean may occur faster than previously expected, even under low-emissions pathways. Here we use an integrated assessment model to explore the implications of a potentially rapid sea-ice-loss process. We consider a scenario leading to a full month free of sea ice in September 2050, followed by three potential trajectories afterward: partial recovery, stabilization, and continued loss of sea ice. We analyze how these scenarios affect the efforts to keep global temperature increase below 2C. Our results show that sea-ice melting in the Arctic requires more stringent mitigation efforts globally. We find that global CO2 emissions would need to reach zero levels 515 years earlier and that the carbon budget would need to be reduced by 20%51% to offset this additional source of warming. The extra mitigation effort would imply an 18%59% higher mitigation cost to society. Our results also show that to achieve the 1.5C target in the presence of ice-free summers negative emissions would be needed. This study highlights the need for a better understanding of how the rapid changes observed in the Arctic may impact our society. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Throughout the late Quaternary, the Sahul (Pleistocene AustraliaNew Guinea) vertebrate fauna was dominated by a diversity of large mammals, birds, and reptiles, commonly referred to as megafauna. Since ca. 450400Ka, approximately 88 species disappeared in Sahul, including kangaroos exceeding 200kg in size, wombat-like animals the size of hippopotamuses, flightless birds, and giant monitor lizards that were likely venomous. Ongoing debates over the primary cause of these extinctions have typically favored climate change or human activities. Improving our understanding of the population biology of extinct megafauna as more refined paleoenvironmental data sets become available will assist in identifying their potential vulnerabilities. Here, we apply a multiproxy approach to analyze fossil teeth from deposits dated to the middle and late Pleistocene at Cuddie Springs in southeastern Australia, assessing relative aridity via oxygen isotopes as well as vegetation and megafaunal diets using both carbon isotopes and dental microwear texture analyses. We report that the Cuddie Springs middle Pleistocene fauna was largely dominated by browsers, including consumers of C4 shrubs, but that by late Pleistocene times the C4 dietary component was markedly reduced. Our results suggest dietary restriction in more arid conditions. These dietary shifts are consistent with other independently derived isotopic data from eggshells and wombat teeth that also suggest a reduction in C4 vegetation after ~45 Ka in southeastern Australia, coincident with increasing aridification through the middle to late Pleistocene. Understanding the ecology of extinct species is important in clarifying the primary drivers of faunal extinction in Sahul. The results presented here highlight the potential impacts of aridification on marsupial megafauna. The trend to increasingly arid conditions through the middle to late Pleistocene (as identified in other paleoenvironmental records and now also observed, in part, in the Cuddie Springs sequence) may have stressed the most vulnerable animals, perhaps accelerating the decline of late Pleistocene megafauna in Australia. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Hemispheric sea ice distribution sets the glacial tempo](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL071307/abstract)
___

**Abstract**

The proxy record of global temperature shows that the dominant periodicity of the glacial cycle shifts from 40 kyr (obliquity) to 100 kyr (eccentricity) about a million years ago. Using climate model simulations, here we show that the pace of the glacial cycle depends on the pattern of hemispheric sea ice growth. In a cold climate the sea ice grows asymmetrically between two hemispheres under changes to Earth's orbital precession, because sea ice growth potential outside of the Arctic Circle is limited. This difference in hemispheric sea ice growth leads to an asymmetry in absorbed solar energy for the two hemispheres, particularly when eccentricity is high, even if the annual average insolation is similar. In a warmer climate, the hemispheric asymmetry of the sea ice decreases as mean Arctic and Antarctic sea ice decreases, diminishing the precession and eccentricity signals and explaining the dominant obliquity signal (40 kyr) before the mid-Pleistocene transition.

<TEXT> It is in relation to the pH scale. Because the pH scale is logarithmic (pH = -log[H^+ ]), a change of one pH unit corresponds to a ten-fold change in hydrogen ion concentration ([Figure 1](http://i.imgur.com/fIiUlvs.jpg)). So a change of 0.1 corresponds to a ~30% change ([figure 2](http://i.imgur.com/6rP4jb0.jpg)).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a typo. From the IPCCs [ Ocean Acidification by Carbon Dioxide](https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch5s5-4-2-3.html):

Ocean pH can be computed from measurements of DIC and alkalinity. A decrease in surface pH of 0.1 over the global ocean was calculated from the estimated uptake of anthropogenic carbon between 1750 and 1994 (Sabine et al., 2004b; Raven et al., 2005), with the lowest decrease (0.06) in the tropics and subtropics, and the highest decrease (0.12) at high latitudes, consistent with the lower buffer capacity of the high latitudes compared to the low latitudes...  A decrease in ocean pH of 0.1 units corresponds to a 30% increase in the concentration of H+ in seawater, assuming that alkalinity and temperature remain constant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Proton pumping accompanies calcification in foraminifera](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14145)
___

**Abstract**

Ongoing ocean acidification is widely reported to reduce the ability of calcifying marine organisms to produce their shells and skeletons. Whereas increased dissolution due to acidification is a largely inorganic process, strong organismal control over biomineralization influences calcification and hence complicates predicting the response of marine calcifyers. Here we show that calcification is driven by rapid transformation of bicarbonate into carbonate inside the cytoplasm, achieved by active outward proton pumping. Moreover, this proton flux is maintained over a wide range of pCO2 levels. We furthermore show that a V-type H^+ ATPase is responsible for the proton flux and thereby calcification. External transformation of bicarbonate into CO2 due to the proton pumping implies that biomineralization does not rely on availability of carbonate ions, but total dissolved CO2 may not reduce calcification, thereby potentially maintaining the current global marine carbonate production. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Rapid decadal convective precipitation increase over Eurasia during the last three decades of the 20th century](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/1/e1600944)
___

**Abstract**

Convective precipitationlocalized, short-lived, intense, and sometimes violentis at the root of challenges associated with observation, simulation, and prediction of precipitation. The understanding of long-term changes in convective precipitation characteristics and their role in precipitation extremes and intensity over extratropical regions are imperative to future water resource management; however, they have been studied very little. We show that annual convective precipitation total has been increasing astonishingly fast, at a rate of 18.4%/C, of which 16% is attributable to an increase in convective precipitation occurrence, and 2.4% is attributable to increased daily intensity based on the 35 years of two (combined) historical data sets of 3-hourly synoptic observations and daily precipitation. We also reveal that annual daily precipitation extreme has been increasing at a rate of about 7.4%/C in convective events only. Concurrently, the overall increase in mean daily precipitation intensity is mostly due to increased convective precipitation, possibly at the expanse of nonconvective precipitation. As a result, transitional seasons are becoming more summer-like as convective becomes the dominant precipitation type that has accompanied higher daily extremes and intensity since the late 1980s. The data also demonstrate that increasing convective precipitation and daily extremes appear to be directly linearly associated with higher atmospheric water vapor accompanying a warming climate over northern Eurasia. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Factors regulating the Great Calcite Belt in the Southern Ocean and its biogeochemical significance](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GB005414/full)
___

**Abstract**

The Great Calcite Belt (GCB) is a region of elevated surface reflectance in the Southern Ocean (SO) covering ~16% of the global ocean and is thought to result from elevated, seasonal concentrations of coccolithophores. Here we describe field observations and experiments from two cruises that crossed the GCB in the Atlantic and Indian sectors of the SO. We confirm the presence of coccolithophores, their coccoliths, and associated optical scattering, located primarily in the region of the subtropical, Agulhas, and Subantarctic frontal regions. Coccolithophore-rich regions were typically associated with high-velocity frontal regions with higher seawater partial pressures of CO2 (pCO2) than the atmosphere, sufficient to reverse the direction of gas exchange to a CO2 source. There was no calcium carbonate (CaCO3) enhancement of particulate organic carbon (POC) export, but there were increased POC transfer efficiencies in high-flux particulate inorganic carbon regions. Contemporaneous observations are synthesized with results of trace-metal incubation experiments, ^234 Th-based flux estimates, and remotely sensed observations to generate a mandala that summarizes our understanding about the factors that regulate the location of the GCB. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Transient reducing greenhouse warming on early Mars](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL071766/full)
___

**Abstract**

The evidence for abundant liquid water on early Mars despite the faint young Sun is a long-standing problem in planetary research. Here we present new ab initio spectroscopic and line-by-line climate calculations of the warming potential of reduced atmospheres on early Mars. We show that the strength of both CO2H2 and CO2CH4 collision-induced absorption (CIA) has previously been significantly underestimated. Contrary to previous expectations, methane could have acted as a powerful greenhouse gas on early Mars due to CO2CH4 CIA in the critical 250500 cm^1 spectral window region. In atmospheres of 0.5 bar CO2 or more, percent levels of H2 or CH4 raise annual mean surface temperatures by tens of degrees, with temperatures reaching 273 K for pressures of 1.252 bars and 210% of H2 and CH4. Methane and hydrogen produced following aqueous alteration of Mars' crust could have combined with volcanically outgassed CO2 to form transient atmospheres of this composition 4.53.5 Ga. Our results also suggest that inhabited exoplanets could retain surface liquid water at significant distances from their host stars. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Field-scale experiments reveal persistent yield gaps in low-input and organic cropping systems](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/01/10/1612311114.full)
___

**Significance**

Meeting future food needs requires a substantial increase in the yields obtained from existing cropland. Prior global analyses have suggested that these gains could come from closing yield gapsdifferences between yields from small-plot research versus those in farmer fields. However, closing this gap requires knowledge of causal factors not yet identified experimentally. Results here suggest that yield gaps can be closed using farming practices that use conventional synthetic chemicals, but practices that rely more on biological managementas is the case throughout much of the developing world and in organic agriculturerequire renewed attention to field-scale resource demands and place greater emphasis on the importance of field-scale experimental research.
 
**Abstract**

Knowledge of production-system performance is largely based on observations at the experimental plot scale. Although yield gaps between plot-scale and field-scale research are widely acknowledged, their extent and persistence have not been experimentally examined in a systematic manner. At a site in southwest Michigan, we conducted a 6-y experiment to test the accuracy with which plot-scale crop-yield results can inform field-scale conclusions. We compared conventional versus alternative, that is, reduced-input and biologically basedorganic, management practices for a cornsoybeanwheat rotation in a randomized complete block-design experiment, using 27 commercial-size agricultural fields. Nearby plot-scale experiments (0.02-ha to 1.0-ha plots) provided a comparison of plot versus field performance. We found that plot-scale yields well matched field-scale yields for conventional management but not for alternative systems. For all three crops, at the plot scale, reduced-input and conventional managements produced similar yields; at the field scale, reduced-input yields were lower than conventional. For soybeans at the plot scale, biological and conventional managements produced similar yields; at the field scale, biological yielded less than conventional. For corn, biological management produced lower yields than conventional in both plot- and field-scale experiments. Wheat yields appeared to be less affected by the experimental scale than corn and soybean. Conventional management was more resilient to field-scale challenges than alternative practices, which were more dependent on timely management interventions; in particular, mechanical weed control. Results underscore the need for much wider adoption of field-scale experimentation when assessing new technologies and production-system performance, especially as related to closing yield gaps in organic farming and in low-resourced systems typical of much of the developing world.

**Abstract**

We employ airborne gravity data from NASA's Operation IceBridge collected in 2009-2014 to infer the bathymetry of sub-ice-shelf cavities in front of Pine Island, Thwaites, Smith and Kohler glaciers, West Antarctica. We use a three-dimensional inversion constrained by multi-beam echo sounding data off shore and bed topography from a mass conservation reconstruction on land. The seamless bed elevation data refine details of the Pine Island sub-ice-shelf cavity, a slightly thinner cavity beneath Thwaites, and previously unknown deep (1,200 m) channels beneath the Crosson and Dotson ice shelves that shallow (500 m and 750 m, respectively) near the ice shelf fronts. These sub-ice-shelf channels define the natural pathways for warm, circumpolar deep water to reach the glacier grounding lines, melt the ice shelves from below, and constrain the pattern of past and future glacial retreat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Estimating changes in global temperature since the pre-industrial period](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/BAMS-D-16-0007.1)
___

**Abstract**

Better defining (or altogether avoiding) the term pre-industrial would aid interpretation of internationally agreed global temperature limits and estimation of the required constraints to avoid reaching those limits.

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process agreed in Paris to limit global surface temperature rise to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels. But what period is pre-industrial? Some-what remarkably, this is not defined within the UNFCCCs many agreements and protocols. Nor is it defined in the IPCCs Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in the evaluation of when particular temperature levels might be reached because no robust definition of the period exists. Here we discuss the important factors to consider when defining a pre-industrial period, based on estimates of historical radiative forcings and the availability of climate observations. There is no perfect period, but we suggest that 1720-1800 is the most suitable choice when discussing global temperature limits. We then estimate the change in global average temperature since pre-industrial using a range of approaches based on observations, radiative forcings, global climate model simulations and proxy evidence. Our assessment is that this pre-industrial period was likely 0.550.80C cooler than 1986-2005 and that 2015 was likely the first year in which global average temperature was more than 1C above pre-industrial levels. We provide some recommendations for how this assessment might be improved in future and suggest that reframing temperature limits with a modern baseline would be inherently less uncertain and more policy-relevant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Estimating changes in global temperature since the pre-industrial period](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/BAMS-D-16-0007.1)
___

**Abstract**

Better defining (or altogether avoiding) the term pre-industrial would aid interpretation of internationally agreed global temperature limits and estimation of the required constraints to avoid reaching those limits.

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process agreed in Paris to limit global surface temperature rise to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels. But what period is pre-industrial? Some-what remarkably, this is not defined within the UNFCCCs many agreements and protocols. Nor is it defined in the IPCCs Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in the evaluation of when particular temperature levels might be reached because no robust definition of the period exists. Here we discuss the important factors to consider when defining a pre-industrial period, based on estimates of historical radiative forcings and the availability of climate observations. There is no perfect period, but we suggest that 1720-1800 is the most suitable choice when discussing global temperature limits. We then estimate the change in global average temperature since pre-industrial using a range of approaches based on observations, radiative forcings, global climate model simulations and proxy evidence. Our assessment is that this pre-industrial period was likely 0.550.80C cooler than 1986-2005 and that 2015 was likely the first year in which global average temperature was more than 1C above pre-industrial levels. We provide some recommendations for how this assessment might be improved in future and suggest that reframing temperature limits with a modern baseline would be inherently less uncertain and more policy-relevant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Norwegian Prime Minister argued that climate gas emission from producing one barrel of oil on the Norwegian continental shelf often is lower than producing the same barrel at a low-cost field in the Middle East.

It's a point worth considering; however, I don't see this being of great significance as there are plenty of oil fields in the Middle East that have comparable emissions, and in some cases having lower emissions, than those situated offshore of Norway: http://oci.carnegieendowment.org/#map?yearSelect=off </TEXT>

<TEXT> The premise of this article is unscientific.

The "unanimous concensus among scientists," is not a good argument for why climate change is something we should worry about. 

That's not the premise of the study. It's not trying to tell us why we should care about climate change, it's examining how we can prevent misinformation campaigns from polarizing public opinion, which is entirely within the scientific field of psychology and understanding how those opinions are formed.

Arguing against the concensus shouldn't be treated like misinforming the public. That is a toxic attitude...

Except that it literally is misinformation campaigns funded through front groups, beach head schools, charities, etc^[1](http://drexel.edu/now/archive/2013/December/Climate-Change/) that are misinforming the public. </TEXT>

**Abstract**

Effectively addressing climate change requires significant changes in individual and collective human behavior and decision-making. Yet, in light of the increasing politicization of (climate) science, and the attempts of vested-interest groups to undermine the scientific consensus on climate change through organized disinformation campaigns, identifying ways to effectively engage with the public about the issue across the political spectrum has proven difficult. A growing body of research suggests that one promising way to counteract the politicization of science is to convey the high level of normative agreement (consensus) among experts about the reality of human-caused climate change. Yet, much prior research examining public opinion dynamics in the context of climate change has done so under conditions with limited external validity. Moreover, no research to date has examined how to protect the public from the spread of influential misinformation about climate change. The current research bridges this divide by exploring how people evaluate and process consensus cues in a polarized information environment. Furthermore, evidence is provided that it is possible to pre-emptively protect (inoculate) public attitudes about climate change against real-world misinformation. </TEXT>

If you were to put a strawberry on top of that vanilla wafer, the added weight would make the cookie sink into the pudding. In the same way, heavy weights on Earth's crust push it down into the mantle, which flows away and bulges out elsewhere. The miles-thick ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica have been depressing the crust beneath them for millennia. That weight has a second effect that you won't see in your dessert: its gravitational pull on the surrounding ocean makes seawater pile up around the coastlines... 

Scientists currently believe ice sheet fingerprints will be the major driver of future regional variations in sea levels. - [NASA](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4701)

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Consistent negative response of US crops to high temperatures in observations and crop models](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13931)
___

**Abstract**

High temperatures are detrimental to crop yields and could lead to global warming-driven reductions in agricultural productivity. To assess future threats, the majority of studies used process-based crop models, but their ability to represent effects of high temperature has been questioned. Here we show that an ensemble of nine crop models reproduces the observed average temperature responses of US maize, soybean and wheat yields. Each day 30C diminishes maize and soybean yields by up to 6% under rainfed conditions. Declines observed in irrigated areas, or simulated assuming full irrigation, are weak. This supports the hypothesis that water stress induced by high temperatures causes the decline. For wheat a negative response to high temperature is neither observed nor simulated under historical conditions, since critical temperatures are rarely exceeded during the growing season. In the future, yields are modelled to decline for all three crops at temperatures 30C. Elevated CO2 can only weakly reduce these yield losses, in contrast to irrigation. </TEXT>

The rise in temperature during the last interglacial, dictated initially by insulation^[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles) , occurred over thousands of years. Increases in sea surface temperatures also took thousands of years (relevant portion of [Figure 1](http://i.imgur.com/d1ZwoDu.jpg)), grossly speaking. The take home message is just how sensitive these ice sheets are to warming temperatures. Anthropogenic global warming is occurring over *vastly* shorter time scales... we're just waiting for the rest of the system to catch up. </TEXT>

All the data sets perform some degree of interpolation, but the GISTEMP, Berkeley and CW data sets  in fact those which have 2016 as much warmer than 2015  do the most interpolation. On the other hand, the HadCRUT4 and NOAAGlobalTemp estimates (in which 2016 is warmer than 2015 by a smaller margin) do less interpolation and, most importantly for the discussion here, they do not interpolate extensively into the polar regions which were particularly warm in November 2016. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Regional and global sea-surface temperatures during the last interglaciation](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6322/276)
___

**Significance**

Understanding how warm intervals affected sea level in the past is vital for projecting how human activities will affect it in the future. Hoffman et al. compiled estimates of sea surface temperatures during the last interglacial period, which lasted from about 129,000 to 116,000 years ago. The global mean annual values were 0.5C warmer than they were 150 years ago and indistinguishable from the 19952014 mean. This is a sobering point, because sea levels during the last interglacial period were 6 to 9 m higher than they are now.

**Abstract**

The last interglaciation (LIG, 129 to 116 thousand years ago) was the most recent time in Earths history when global mean sea level was substantially higher than it is at present. However, reconstructions of LIG global temperature remain uncertain, with estimates ranging from no significant difference to nearly 2C warmer than present-day temperatures. Here we use a network of sea-surface temperature (SST) records to reconstruct spatiotemporal variability in regional and global SSTs during the LIG. Our results indicate that peak LIG global mean annual SSTs were 0.5  0.3C warmer than the climatological mean from 1870 to 1889 and indistinguishable from the 1995 to 2014 mean. LIG warming in the extratropical latitudes occurred in response to boreal insolation and the bipolar seesaw, whereas tropical SSTs were slightly cooler than the 1870 to 1889 mean in response to reduced mean annual insolation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No one has even established that high CO2 is good for biodiversity, as far as I'm aware. Furthermore, in more recent geological periods the two are clearly anti-correlated, while also showing anti-correlation over Earth's entire geologic history. CO2 has declined, while biodiversity has increased. 

Some plants may benefit from higher atmospheric CO2, other limiting factors not included, but that's about it. </TEXT>

Geologically speaking, times of greatest biodiversity has CO2 over 5000 ppm.

Geologically speaking, biodiversity has never been greater than in more recent periods (seen [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Phanerozoic_Biodiversity.png)). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have a look at which 'baseline' or [climate normals](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/climate-normals)' is being used here (hint: 1979 - 2000). Changing which climate normal the data is compared to will change the anomaly. Other details to take note of relate to which portion of the atmosphere the values are relating to... for example, the lower troposphere (TLT), mid-troposphere (TMT), and lower stratosphere (TLS) each average over a different layer of the atmosphere (seen [here](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/msu_weighting_functions.png)). Different agencies will also use different methods in how they process the data set which can also yield different values ([example](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/us_rawadj_a-640x465.png)), along with which data sets rely more on interpolation than others (seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/IZlfAO0.jpg)). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Rainfall regimes of the Green Sahara](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/1/e1601503.full)
___

**Abstract**

During the Green Sahara period (11,000 to 5000 years before the present), the Sahara desert received high amounts of rainfall, supporting diverse vegetation, permanent lakes, and human populations. Our knowledge of rainfall rates and the spatiotemporal extent of wet conditions has suffered from a lack of continuous sedimentary records. We present a quantitative reconstruction of western Saharan precipitation derived from leaf wax isotopes in marine sediments. Our data indicate that the Green Sahara extended to 31N and likely ended abruptly. We find evidence for a prolonged pause in Green Sahara conditions 8000 years ago, coincident with a temporary abandonment of occupational sites by Neolithic humans. The rainfall rates inferred from our data are best explained by strong vegetation and dust feedbacks; without these mechanisms, climate models systematically fail to reproduce the Green Sahara. This study suggests that accurate simulations of future climate change in the Sahara and Sahel will require improvements in our ability to simulate vegetation and dust feedbacks.

<TEXT> Study: [Fossil forest reveals sunspot activity in the early Permian](http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/early/2017/01/12/G38669.1.abstract)
___

**Abstract**

Modern-day periodic climate pattern variations related to solar activity are well known. High-resolution records such as varves, ice cores, and tree-ring sequences are commonly used for reconstructing climatic variations in the younger geological history. For the first time we apply dendrochronological methods to Paleozoic trees in order to recognize annual variations. Large woody tree trunks from the early Permian Fossil Forest of Chemnitz, southeast Germany, show a regular cyclicity in tree-ring formation. The mean ring curve reveals a 10.62 yr cyclicity, the duration of which is almost identical to the modern 11 yr solar cycle. Therefore, we speculate and further discuss that, like today, sunspot activity caused fluctuations of cosmic radiation input to the atmosphere, affecting cloud formation and annual rates of precipitation, which are reflected in the tree-ring archive. This is the earliest record of sunspot cyclicity and simultaneously demonstrates its long-term stable periodicity for at least 300 m.y.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For those curious as to why the discrepancies exist between agencies the UK MetOffice provides the following, from their article: [An overview of global annual average temperature anomalies in 2016](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/news/2017/overview-global-temperature-2016):

**Why the differences?**

One major difference between the data sets is the way they deal with geographically-uneven sampling. It leads to a difference in the degree to which they attempt to fill gaps in the station network using information from nearby stations, as illustrated in Figure 2. All the data sets perform some degree of interpolation, but the GISTEMP, Berkeley and CW data sets  in fact those which have 2016 as much warmer than 2015  do the most interpolation. On the other hand, the HadCRUT4 and NOAAGlobalTemp estimates (in which 2016 is warmer than 2015 by a smaller margin) do less interpolation and, most importantly for the discussion here, they do not interpolate extensively into the polar regions which were particularly warm in November 2016.

**[Figure 2](http://i.imgur.com/IZlfAO0.jpg)**

*Surface temperature anomalies for November 2016 (C, relative to the 1961-1990 average) from the five traditional global temperature data sets showing the difference in coverage: HadCRUT4, Cowtan and Way, NOAAGlobalTemp, Berkeley Earth and GISTEMP. Colour scales are shown beneath each diagram. The outer edge of the colours scales are 10C unless the highest or lowest anomalies for the month lie outside that range.* </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Thermokarst is the process whereby the thawing of ice-rich permafrost ground causes land subsidence, resulting in development of distinctive landforms. Accelerated thermokarst due to climate change will damage infrastructure, but also impact hydrology, ecology and biogeochemistry. Here, we present a circumpolar assessment of the distribution of thermokarst landscapes, defined as landscapes comprised of current thermokarst landforms and areas susceptible to future thermokarst development. At 3.6  10^6 km^2 , thermokarst landscapes are estimated to cover 20% of the northern permafrost region, with approximately equal contributions from three landscape types where characteristic wetland, lake and hillslope thermokarst landforms occur. We estimate that approximately half of the below-ground organic carbon within the study region is stored in thermokarst landscapes. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly considering thermokarst when assessing impacts of climate change, including future landscape greenhouse gas emissions, and provide a means for assessing such impacts at the circumpolar scale. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

The differential warming of land and ocean leads to many continental regions in the Northern Hemisphere warming at rates higher than the global mean temperature. Adaptation and conservation efforts will, therefore, benefit from understanding regional consequences of limiting the global mean temperature increase to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, a limit agreed upon at the United Nations Climate Summit in Paris in December 2015. Here, we analyze climate model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) to determine the timing and magnitude of regional temperature and precipitation changes across the contiguous United States (US) for global warming of 1.5 and 2C and highlight consensus and uncertainties in model projections and their implications for making decisions. The regional warming rates differ considerably across the contiguous US, but all regions are projected to reach 2C about 10-20 years before the global mean temperature. Although there is uncertainty in the timing of exactly when the 1.5 and 2C thresholds will be crossed regionally, over 80% of the models project at least 2C warming by 2050 for all regions for the high emissions scenario. This threshold-based approach also highlights regional variations in the rate of warming across the US. The fastest warming region in the contiguous US is the Northeast, which is projected to warm by 3C when global warming reaches 2C. The signal-to-noise ratio calculations indicate that the regional warming estimates remain outside the envelope of uncertainty throughout the twenty-first century, making them potentially useful to planners. The regional precipitation projections for global warming of 1.5C and 2C are uncertain, but the eastern US is projected to experience wetter winters and the Great Plains and the Northwest US are projected to experience drier summers in the future. The impact of different scenarios on regional precipitation projections is negligible throughout the twenty-first century compared to uncertainties associated with internal variability and model diversity. </TEXT>

**Abstract**

Sixty-six million years ago, the end-Cretaceous mass extinction ended the reign of the dinosaurs. Flood basalt eruptions and an asteroid impact are widely discussed causes, yet their contributions remain debated. Modeling the environmental changes after the Chicxulub impact can shed light on this question. Existing studies, however, focused on the effect of dust or used one-dimensional, noncoupled atmosphere models. Here we explore the longer-lasting cooling due to sulfate aerosols using a coupled climate model. Depending on aerosol stratospheric residence time, global annual mean surface air temperature decreased by at least 26C, with 3 to 16 years subfreezing temperatures and a recovery time larger than 30 years. The surface cooling triggered vigorous ocean mixing which could have resulted in a plankton bloom due to upwelling of nutrients. These dramatic environmental changes suggest a pivotal role of the impact in the end-Cretaceous extinction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Links between atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere from two decades of microseism observations on the Antarctic Peninsula](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JF004098/abstract)
___

**Abstract**

The lack of landmasses, climatological low pressure, and strong circumpolar westerly winds between the latitudes of 50S to 65S produce exceptional storm-driven wave conditions in the Southern Ocean. This combination makes the Antarctic Peninsula one of Earth's most notable regions of high-amplitude wave activity and thus, ocean-swell-driven microseism noise in both the primary (direct wave-coastal region interactions) and secondary (direct ocean floor forcing due to interacting wave trains) period bands. Microseism observations are examined across 23 years (19932015) from Palmer Station (PMSA), on the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, and from East Falkland Island (EFI). These records provide a spatially integrative measure of both Southern Ocean wave amplitudes and the interactions between ocean waves and the solid Earth in the presence of sea ice, which can reduce wave coupling with the continental shelf. We utilize a spatiotemporal correlation-based approach to illuminate how the distribution of sea ice influences seasonal microseism power. We characterize primary and secondary microseism power due to variations in sea ice and find that primary microseism energy is both more sensitive to sea ice and more capable of propagating across ocean basins than secondary microseism energy. During positive phases of the Southern Annular Mode, sea ice is reduced in the Bellingshausen Sea and overall storm activity in the Drake Passage increases, thus strongly increasing microseism power levels. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Environmental Factors Affecting Survival of Immature Ixodes scapularis and Implications for Geographical Distribution of Lyme Disease: The Climate/Behavior Hypothesis](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168723)
___

**Abstract**

Recent reports suggest that host-seeking nymphs in southern populations of Ixodes scapularis remain below the leaf litter surface, while northern nymphs seek hosts on leaves and twigs above the litter surface. This behavioral difference potentially results in decreased tick contact with humans in the south, and fewer cases of Lyme disease. We studied whether north-south differences in tick survival patterns might contribute to this phenomenon. Four month old larvae resulting from a cross between Wisconsin males and South Carolina females died faster under southern than under northern conditions in the lab, as has previously been reported for ticks from both northern and southern populations. However, newly-emerged larvae from Rhode Island parents did not differ consistently in mortality under northern and southern conditions, possibly because of their younger age. Survival is lower, and so the north-south survival difference might be greater in older ticks. Larval survival was positively related to larval size (as measured by scutal area), while survival was positively related to larval fat content in some, but not all, trials. The difference in larval survival under northern vs. southern conditions might simply result from faster metabolism under warmer southern conditions leading to shorter life spans. However, ticks consistently died faster under southern than under northern conditions in the laboratory when relative humidity was low (75%), but not under moderate (85%) or high (95%) RH. Therefore, mortality due to desiccation stress is greater under southern than under northern conditions. We hypothesize that mortality resulting from the greater desiccation stress under southern conditions acts as a selective pressure resulting in the evolution of host-seeking behavior in which immatures remain below the leaf litter surface in southern I. scapularis populations, so as to avoid the desiccating conditions at the surface. If this hypothesis is correct, it has implications for the effect of climate change on the future distribution of Lyme disease. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Climate change remains one of the major international environmental challenges facing nations. Yet nations have to date taken minimal policies to slow climate change. Moreover, there has been no major improvement in emissions trends as of the latest data. The current study uses the updated DICE model to present new projections and the impacts of alternative climate policies. It also presents a new set of estimates of the uncertainties about future climate change and compares the results will those of other integrated assessment models. The study confirms past estimates of likely rapid climate change over the next century if there are not major climate-change policies. It suggests that it will be extremely difficult to achieve the 2C target of international agreements even if ambitious policies are introduced in the near term. The required carbon price needed to achieve current targets has risen over time as policies have been delayed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Global atmospheric teleconnections during DansgaardOeschger events](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v10/n1/full/ngeo2848.html)
___

**Abstract**

During the last glacial period, the North Atlantic region experienced a series of DansgaardOeschger cycles in which climate abruptly alternated between warm and cold periods. Corresponding variations in Antarctic surface temperature were out of phase with their Northern Hemisphere counterparts. The temperature relationship between the hemispheres is commonly attributed to an interhemispheric redistribution of heat by the ocean overturning circulation. Changes in ocean heat transport should be accompanied by changes in atmospheric circulation to satisfy global energy budget constraints. Although changes in tropical atmospheric circulation linked to abrupt events in the Northern Hemisphere are well documented, evidence for predicted changes in the Southern Hemispheres atmospheric circulation during DansgaardOeschger cycles is lacking. Here we use a high-resolution deuterium-excess record from West Antarctica to show that the latitude of the mean moisture source for Antarctic precipitation changed in phase with abrupt shifts in Northern Hemisphere climate, and significantly before Antarctic temperature change. This provides direct evidence that Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude storm tracks shifted within decades of abrupt changes in the North Atlantic, in parallel with meridional migrations of the intertropical convergence zone. We conclude that both oceanic and atmospheric processes, operating on different timescales, link the hemispheres during abrupt climate change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Arctic Ice Management](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016EF000410/epdf) (epdf)
___

**Abstract**

As the Earth's climate has changed, Arctic sea ice extent has decreased drastically. It is likely that the late-summer Arctic will be ice-free as soon as the 2030s. This loss of sea ice represents one of the most severe positive feedbacks in the climate system, as sunlight that would otherwise be reflected by sea ice is absorbed by open ocean. It is unlikely that CO2 levels and mean temperatures can be decreased in time to prevent this loss, so restoring sea ice artificially is an imperative. Here we investigate a means for enhancing Arctic sea ice production by using wind power during the Arctic winter to pump water to the surface, where it will freeze more rapidly. We show that where appropriate devices are employed, it is possible to increase ice thickness above natural levels, by about 1 m over the course of the winter. We examine the effects this has in the Arctic climate, concluding that deployment over 10% of the Arctic, especially where ice survival is marginal, could more than reverse current trends of ice loss in the Arctic, using existing industrial capacity. We propose that winter ice thickening by wind-powered pumps be considered and assessed as part of a multi-pronged strategy for restoring sea ice and arresting the strongest feedbacks in the climate system. </TEXT>

___

**Summary**

Ocean surface warming is resulting in an expansion of stratified, low-nutrient environments, a process referred to as ocean desertification. A challenge for assessing the impact of these changes is the lack of robust baseline information on the biological communities that carry out marine photosynthesis. Phytoplankton perform half of global biological CO2 uptake, fuel marine food chains, and include diverse eukaryotic algae that have photosynthetic organelles (plastids) acquired through multiple evolutionary events. While amassing data from ocean ecosystems for the Baselines Initiative (6,177 near full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences and 9.4 million high-quality 16S V1-V2 amplicons) we identified two deep-branching plastid lineages based on 16S rRNA gene data. The two lineages have global distributions, but do not correspond to known phytoplankton. How the newly discovered phytoplankton lineages contribute to food chains and vertical carbon export to the deep sea remains unknown, but their prevalence in expanding, low nutrient surface waters suggests they will have a role in future oceans. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Centuries of thermal sea-level rise due to anthropogenic emissions of short-lived greenhouse gases](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/01/03/1612066114.short?rss=1)
___

**Significance**

Human activities such as fossil-fuel burning have increased emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which have warmed the Earths atmosphere and ocean and caused sea levels to rise. Some of these GHGs (e.g., methane) have atmospheric lifetimes of decades or less, whereas others (e.g., carbon dioxide) persist for centuries to millennia. As policy seeks to reduce climate changes, it is important to understand how mitigation of different gases each contributes to this goal. Our study shows that short-lived GHGs contribute to thermal expansion of the ocean over much longer time scales than their atmospheric lifetimes. Actions taken to reduce emissions of short-lived gases could mitigate centuries of additional future sea-level rise.

**Abstract**

Mitigation of anthropogenic greenhouse gases with short lifetimes (order of a year to decades) can contribute to limiting warming, but less attention has been paid to their impacts on longer-term sea-level rise. We show that short-lived greenhouse gases contribute to sea-level rise through thermal expansion (TSLR) over much longer time scales than their atmospheric lifetimes. For example, at least half of the TSLR due to increases in methane is expected to remain present for more than 200 y, even if anthropogenic emissions cease altogether, despite the 10-y atmospheric lifetime of this gas. Chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons have already been phased out under the Montreal Protocol due to concerns about ozone depletion and provide an illustration of how emission reductions avoid multiple centuries of future TSLR. We examine the world avoided by the Montreal Protocol by showing that if these gases had instead been eliminated in 2050, additional TSLR of up to about 14 cm would be expected in the 21st century, with continuing contributions lasting more than 500 y. Emissions of the hydrofluorocarbon substitutes in the next half-century would also contribute to centuries of future TSLR. Consideration of the time scales of reversibility of TSLR due to short-lived substances provides insights into physical processes: sea-level rise is often assumed to follow air temperature, but this assumption holds only for TSLR when temperatures are increasing. We present a more complete formulation that is accurate even when atmospheric temperatures are stable or decreasing due to reductions in short-lived gases or net radiative forcing.

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Climatic regulation of the neurotoxin domoic acid](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/01/03/1606798114.full)
___

**Significance**

We investigate regulation of domoic acid, a potent marine phycotoxin, at the climate scale. Due to the threat domoic acid can pose to public health, marine wildlife, and coastal economies, decades of laboratory experiments have examined controls on domoic acid production without reaching consensus on reliable toxin-producing conditions. Our findings reveal an association between domoic acid in shellfish and climate-scale warm ocean conditions, a unique, large-scale perspective relative to previous work.

**Abstract**

Domoic acid is a potent neurotoxin produced by certain marine microalgae that can accumulate in the foodweb, posing a health threat to human seafood consumers and wildlife in coastal regions worldwide. Evidence of climatic regulation of domoic acid in shellfish over the past 20 y in the Northern California Current regime is shown. The timing of elevated domoic acid is strongly related to warm phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Oceanic Nio Index, an indicator of El Nio events. Ocean conditions in the northeast Pacific that are associated with warm phases of these indices, including changes in prevailing currents and advection of anomalously warm water masses onto the continental shelf, are hypothesized to contribute to increases in this toxin.

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Climatic regulation of the neurotoxin domoic acid](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/01/03/1606798114.full)
___

**Significance**

We investigate regulation of domoic acid, a potent marine phycotoxin, at the climate scale. Due to the threat domoic acid can pose to public health, marine wildlife, and coastal economies, decades of laboratory experiments have examined controls on domoic acid production without reaching consensus on reliable toxin-producing conditions. Our findings reveal an association between domoic acid in shellfish and climate-scale warm ocean conditions, a unique, large-scale perspective relative to previous work.

**Abstract**

Domoic acid is a potent neurotoxin produced by certain marine microalgae that can accumulate in the foodweb, posing a health threat to human seafood consumers and wildlife in coastal regions worldwide. Evidence of climatic regulation of domoic acid in shellfish over the past 20 y in the Northern California Current regime is shown. The timing of elevated domoic acid is strongly related to warm phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Oceanic Nio Index, an indicator of El Nio events. Ocean conditions in the northeast Pacific that are associated with warm phases of these indices, including changes in prevailing currents and advection of anomalously warm water masses onto the continental shelf, are hypothesized to contribute to increases in this toxin. We present an applied domoic acid risk assessment model for the US West Coast based on combined climatic and local variables. Evidence of regional- to basin-scale controls on domoic acid has not previously been presented. Our findings have implications in coastal zones worldwide that are affected by this toxin and are particularly relevant given the increased frequency of anomalously warm ocean conditions.

<TEXT> Study: [Accelerated ice shelf rifting and retreat at Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL071360/abstract)
___

**Abstract**

Pine Island Glacier has undergone several major iceberg calving events over the past decades. These typically occurred when a rift at the heavily fractured shear margin propagated across the width of the ice shelf. This type of calving is common on polar ice shelves, with no clear connection to ocean-ice dynamic forcing. In contrast, we report on the recent development of multiple rifts initiating from basal crevasses in the center of the ice shelf, resulted in calving further upglacier than previously observed. Coincident with rift formation was the sudden disintegration of the ice mlange that filled the northern shear margin, resulting in ice sheet detachment from this margin. Examination of ice velocity suggests that this internal rifting resulted from the combination of a change in ice shelf stress regime caused by disintegration of the mlange and intensified melting within basal crevasses, both of which may be linked to ocean forcing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are lengthy, and detailed explanations but the short answers are simple and effective. The current Solar cycle, [cycle 24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle_24), which began in 2008 is the weakest solar cycle in over a century - yet Earth's globally averaged temperature continues to warm. Furthermore, if the Sun was the main driver of recent warming trends, we should see warming of all the layers of the Earth's atmosphere warming together, seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/6spCprE.jpg); however, we do not. What we see is warming in the lower most layers and cooling the upper layers, seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/7B1JiXB.jpg). This is one of the predictions of global warming, as the concentration of GHGs within the troposphere increase they trap more and more thermal radiation, preventing a portion of it from reaching the upper atmosphere - thus the cooling anomaly.

The rate of heat escape from the Earth, geothermal heat flux, is slow and steady, operating on time scales that are well outside of modern warming rates. Current evidence of warming below ~2000m shows no measurable warming^[1](https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/06oct_abyss) . </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Overlooked possibility of a collapsed Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation in warming climate](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/1/e1601666.full)
___

**Abstract**

Changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) are moderate in most climate model projections under increasing greenhouse gas forcing. This intermodel consensus may be an artifact of common model biases that favor a stable AMOC. Observationally based freshwater budget analyses suggest that the AMOC is in an unstable regime susceptible for large changes in response to perturbations. By correcting the model biases, we show that the AMOC collapses 300 years after the atmospheric CO2 concentration is abruptly doubled from the 1990 level. Compared to an uncorrected model, the AMOC collapse brings about large, markedly different climate responses: a prominent cooling over the northern North Atlantic and neighboring areas, sea ice increases over the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian seas and to the south of Greenland, and a significant southward rain-belt migration over the tropical Atlantic. Our results highlight the need to develop dynamical metrics to constrain models and the importance of reducing model biases in long-term climate projection. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We are *still* in an ice age, known as the Ice Age which started 2.58 million years ago and marks the beginning of the Pleistocene epoch. We are currently within a warm period known as [MIS 1](http://www.geo.arizona.edu/palynology/geos462/QuaTimeMIS.jpg), or an interglacial in the current ice age known as the Holocene which began ~11.7 thousand years ago. 

Natural cycles in orbital parameters, known as Milankovitch cycles, indicate that the Earth should be entering a cooling phase - a glacial period - however, it has been well established that under recent Earth system conditions atmospheric CO2 must fall below at least 280ppm to initiate the onset of a glacial period. This is easily seen on the [Keeling curve](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/wp-content/plugins/sio-bluemoon/graphs/co2_800k.png) as well as our current atmospheric CO2 level.

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Assessing recent warming using instrumentally homogeneous sea surface temperature records](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/1/e1601207.full)
___

**Abstract**

Sea surface temperature (SST) records are subject to potential biases due to changing instrumentation and measurement practices. Significant differences exist between commonly used composite SST reconstructions from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Extended Reconstruction Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST), the Hadley Centre SST data set (HadSST3), and the Japanese Meteorological Agencys Centennial Observation-Based Estimates of SSTs (COBE-SST) from 2003 to the present. The update from ERSST version 3b to version 4 resulted in an increase in the operational SST trend estimate during the last 19 years from 0.07 to 0.12C per decade, indicating a higher rate of warming in recent years. We show that ERSST version 4 trends generally agree with largely independent, near-global, and instrumentally homogeneous SST measurements from floating buoys, Argo floats, and radiometer-based satellite measurements that have been developed and deployed during the past two decades. We find a large cooling bias in ERSST version 3b and smaller but significant cooling biases in HadSST3 and COBE-SST from 2003 to the present, with respect to most series examined. These results suggest that reported rates of SST warming in recent years have been underestimated in these three data sets. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Does anyone know why this so called hiatus was so widely publicized?

In part, different data sets. Specifically two that are known to be problematic, due to satellite drift, etc. The denialist camp typically disproves of data sets by NASA (GIS), and the UK Met Office (HadCRUT) while vouching for data sets that rely solely on satellite data such as the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) and the UAH satellite temperature dataset (published by John Christy and Roy Spencer, both climate science denialists). Most cherry pick a start date of 1998 (one of the strongest El Nino events in recent history)... 

Plotting the different data sets from 1998 to 2016 the differences are quite apparent:

- [RSS](http://woodfortrees.org/plot/rss/from:1998/to:2016/plot/rss/from:1998/to:2016/trend)

- [UAH](http://woodfortrees.org/plot/uah6/from:1998/to:2016/plot/uah6/from:1998/to:2016/trend)

- [GIS](http://woodfortrees.org/plot/gistemp/from:1998/to:2016/plot/gistemp/from:1998/to:2016/trend)

- [HadCRUT](http://woodfortrees.org/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1998/to:2016/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1998/to:2016/trend)

Leaving the climate denialists cherry picked dates behind, the actual scientific community - depending on which data sets they incorporated and which methods they used - did see a decrease in the overall rate of warming, though it was still warming, while others argued that there was no decrease in the overall rate of warming.

It seems more like an underestimate of warming...

A large number of scientists would agree with that statement. You may find the following article on this study to be elucidating: [Assessing Recent Warming Using Instrumentally Homogenous Sea Surface Temperature Records](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~kdc3/papers/ihsst2016/background.html)

<TEXT> They are in one scenario and they are not in another. They run several model runs under two different representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5   RCP8.5) and compare their findings.

The representative concentration pathways (RCPs) are named according to radiative forcing target level for 2100, where each approximately corresponds to an atmospheric CO2 concentration value as follows:

Representative Concentration Pathway | Description
---|---|----
RCP8.5 | Rising radiative forcing pathway leading to 8.5 W/m2 (~1370 ppm CO2 eq) by 2100. |
RCP6 | Stabilization without overshoot pathway to 6 W/m2 (~850 ppm CO2 eq) at stabilization after 2100 |
RCP4.5 | Stabilization without overshoot pathway to 4.5 W/m2 (~650 ppm CO2 eq) at stabilization after 2100 |
RCP2.6 | Peak in radiative forcing at ~3 W/m2 (~490 ppm CO2 eq) before 2100 and then decline (the selected pathway declines to 2.6 W/m2 by 2100) | 
[source](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0148-z)

Each RCP contains the same categories of data, but the values vary a great deal, reflecting different emission trajectories over time as determined by the underlying socio-economic assumptions (which are unique to each RCP). While RCP4.5 (and others except RCP8.5) assume stabilization of CO2 emissions (through some form of mitigation policies, technology, etc) RCP8.5 does not:

RCP8.5 is a so-called baseline scenario that does not include any specific climate mitigation target. The greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations in this scenario increase considerably over time, leading to a radiative forcing of 8.5 W/m2 at the end of the century.^[1](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0149-y)

This study looked at RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 and found the following:

...our results suggest that if, by mitigation measures, CO2 levels are kept well below those projected by the business-as-usual RCP8.5 scenario, the effect of GrIS mass loss on the AMOC strength will likely remain limited and an AMOC collapse, and its potentially dangerous impacts, is very unlikely.

**Abstract**

Precipitation-gauge observations and atmospheric reanalysis are combined to develop an analogue method for detecting heavy precipitation events based on prevailing large-scale atmospheric conditions. Combinations of atmospheric variables for circulation (geopotential height and wind vector) and moisture (surface specific humidity, column and up to 500hPa precipitable water) are examined to construct analogue schemes for the winter (December-January-February, DJF) of the Pacific Coast California (PCCA) and the summer (June-July-August, JJA) of the Midwestern United States (MWST). The detection diagnostics of analogue schemes are calibrated with 1979-2005 and validated with 2006-2014 NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA). All analogue schemes are found to significantly improve upon MERRA precipitation in characterizing the occurrence and interannual variations of observed heavy precipitation events in the MWST. When evaluated with the late 20th century climate model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), all analogue schemes produce model medians of heavy precipitation frequency that are more consistent with observations and have smaller inter-model discrepancies than model-based precipitation. Under Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, the CMIP5-based analogue schemes produce trends in heavy precipitation occurrence through the 21st century that are consistent with model-based precipitation  but with smaller inter-model disparity. The median trends in heavy precipitation frequency are positive for DJF over PCCA, but are slightly negative for JJA over the MWST. Overall, the analyses highlight the potential of the analogue as a powerful diagnostic tool for model deficiencies and its complementarity to an evaluation of heavy precipitation frequency based on model precipitation alone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Projecting RCP8.5 out to 2300 is not realistic, and projecting RCP8.5 out to 2100 shows no collapse of the AMOC, only a weakening by ~37%... that's essentially my initial point. Under no circumstance do we see a likelihood greater than 45% of the AMOC actually collapsing, and the only way we get close is by projecting RCP8.5 out to 2300. When the world is already concerned about emissions, now, and beginning to take action I find it entirely unrealistic to assume a 'business as usual' scenario for another nearly 300 years. That's not to say it's not useful to do so, just that it isn't representative of the real world. 

In regard to energy resources trends tend to show at least a plateau by 2040, for example, the National Energy Board projections, [here](https://www.neb-one.gc.ca/nrg/ntgrtd/ftr/2016/index-eng.html) (which is in good agreement with others such as OPEC). The key issue many have raised in regard to the projections claimed by the NEB is that they do not take into account *any* climate mitigation policies. They note this themselves under their uncertainties:

In late 2015, the Paris Climate Conference culminated in an ambitious new global climate agreement which will have significant implications for Canadian and global energy use trends. Policies and programs that may result from various recent provincial announcements and the Paris Agreement are not included in the analysis in EF 2016.

Canada's provinces have already implemented carbon tax or cap   trade policies as of this year (some prior). Supply is also projected to decline by mid century where it peaks around 2025 and declines thereafter^[1](http://i.imgur.com/GEncKPO.jpg), ^[2](http://i.imgur.com/pb8Ivok.jpg) ([source](http://woo.opec.org/)).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Though it was not included in the title it's important to note the following for context:

We find that GrIS melting affects AMOC projections, even though it is of secondary importance. By years 20902100, the AMOC weakens by 18% [3%, 34%; 90% probability] in an intermediate greenhouse-gas mitigation scenario and by 37% [15%, 65%] under continued high emissions. Afterward, it stabilizes in the former but continues to decline in the latter to 74% [+4%, 100%] by 22902300, with a 44% likelihood of an AMOC collapse. This result suggests that an AMOC collapse can be avoided by CO2 mitigation.

If I'm not mistaken, all projections see a significant decrease in the combustion of fossil fuels for energy production with further decreases noted by energy companies ~~as a result of declining oil and gas reserves~~ by ~mid century. It seems folly to therefore extrapolate continued high emissions scenarios upwards of nearly 300 years into the future, and therefore almost certain (on this studies values) that the AMOC will not collapse.

Furthermore, there is some degree of doubt as to whether or not current observed reduction in the AMOC is actually a slowing down, or a return to normal from a relative high. Depending on the assumptions (initial conditions) of this paper, this may further extend the stability of the AMOC. 

EDIT: Supply, not necessarily reserves </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [First detection of ammonia (NH3) in the Asian summer monsoon upper troposphere](http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/16/14357/2016/)
___

**Abstract**:

Ammonia (NH3) has been detected in the upper troposphere by the analysis of averaged MIPAS (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding) infrared limb-emission spectra. We have found enhanced amounts of NH3 within the region of the Asian summer monsoon at 1215km altitude. Three-monthly, 10 longitude10 latitude average profiles reaching maximum mixing ratios of around 30pptv in this altitude range have been retrieved, with a vertical resolution of 38km and estimated errors of about 5pptv. These observations show that loss processes during transport from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere within the Asian monsoon do not deplete the air entirely of NH3. Thus, ammonia might contribute to the so-called Asian tropopause aerosol layer by the formation of ammonium aerosol particles. On a global scale, outside the monsoon area and during different seasons, we could not detect enhanced values of NH3 above the actual detection limit of about 35pptv. This upper bound helps to constrain global model simulations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Comprehensive analysis of nanodiamond evidence relating to the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.2892/full)
___

**Abstract**:

During the end of the last glacial period in the Northern Hemisphere near 12.9k cal a BP, deglacial warming of the Bllingllerod interstadial ceased abruptly and the climate returned to glacial conditions for an interval of about 1300 years known as the Younger Dryas stadial. The Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis proposes that the onset of the Younger Dryas climate reversal, Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions and disappearance of the Clovis paleoindian lithic technology were coeval and caused by continent-wide catastrophic effects of impact/bolide events in North America. While there are no known impact structures dated to the Younger Dryas onset, physical evidence of the impact/bolide events is argued to be present in sediments spanning several continents at stratigraphic levels inferred to date to the Blling-llerod/Younger Dryas boundary (YDB). Reports of nanometer to submicron-sized diamonds in YDB sediments, in particular the rare 2H hexagonal polytype of diamond, lonsdaleite, have been presented as strong evidence for shock processing of crustal materials. We review the available data on diamonds in sediments and provide new data. We find no evidence for lonsdaleite in YDB sediments and find no evidence of a spike in nanodiamond concentration at the YDB layer to support the impact hypothesis.


Study (open access): [Interpreting palaeofire evidence from fluvial sediments: a case study from Santa Rosa Island, California, with implications for the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.2914/full)
___

**Abstract**:

Fluvial sequences from the late Pleistocene to the Holocene are exposed in Arlington Canyon, Santa Rosa Island, Northern Channel Islands, California, USA, including one outcrop that features centrally in the controversial hypothesis of an extra-terrestrial impact at the onset of the Younger Dryas. The fluvial sequence in Arlington Canyon contains a significant quantity and range of organic material, much of which has been charred. The purpose of this study was to systematically describe the key outcrop of the Arlington sequence, provide new radiocarbon age control and analyse organic material in the Arlington sediments within a rigorous palaeobotanical and palaeo-charcoal context. These analyses provide a test of previous claims for catastrophic impact-induced fire in Arlington Canyon. Carbonaceous spherular materials were identified as predominantly fungal sclerotia; carbon elongates are predominantly arthropod coprolites, including termite frass. Glassy carbon formed from the precipitation of tars during charcoalification. None of these materials indicate high-temperature formation or combustion. Charcoal and other materials in Arlington Canyon document widespread and frequent fires both before and after the onset of the Younger Dryas, recording predominantly low-temperature surface fires. In summary, we find no evidence in Arlington Canyon for an extra-terrestrial impact or catastrophic impact-induced fire.

<TEXT> ...does not represent a general trend over a longer period of time.

That's incorrect, both currently, and forecasting into the future. The study itself (which can be found [here](https://wwa.climatecentral.org/analyses/north-pole-nov-dec-2016/)) states the following:

Finally, warm episodes near the pole are usually due to so-called moist intrusions: warm and moist air from the mid-latitudes that not only advects heat, but also clouds that block outgoing long-wave radiation and hence trap more heat. There is some evidence that these have become more frequent (Woods and Caballero, 2016). [Figure 4](https://worldweatherattribution.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/fig4.png)

Furthermore the modelling ensembles were unable to produce events such as this without including human induced climate change:

These results suggest that it is extremely unlikely this event would occur in the absence of human-induced climate change. 

See [Figure 9](https://worldweatherattribution.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/fig9.png) Probability Density Functions of Arctic temperature anomalies in the ALL-forcings ensemble (red) and NAT-forcings ensemble (blue).

Climate attribution is a growing area of research and we can most certainly say whether or not an event may or may not have been made more likely due to global warming.

**abstract**

Heterogeneous ice nucleation is a physical chemistry process of critical relevance to a range of topics in the fundamental and applied sciences and technologies. Heterogeneous ice nucleation remains insufficiently understood, partially due to the lack of experimental methods capable of obtaining in situ microscopic details of ice formation over nucleating substrates or particles. We present microscopic observations of ice nucleation events on kaolinite particles at the nanoscale and demonstrate the capability of direct tracking and micro-spectroscopic characterization of individual ice nucleating particles (INPs) in an authentic atmospheric sample. This approach utilizes a custom-built ice nucleation cell, interfaced with an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (IN-ESEM platform) operated at temperatures and relative humidities relevant for heterogeneous ice nucleation. The IN-ESEM platform allows dynamic observations of individual ice formation events over particles in isobaric and isothermal experiments. Isothermal experiments on individual kaolinite particles demonstrate that ice crystals preferably nucleate at the edges of the stacked kaolinite platelets, rather than on their basal planes. These experimental observations of the location of ice nucleation provide direct information for further theoretical chemistry predictions of ice formation on kaolinite. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To me this is like climate skeptics saying "reminder, in 1975 scientists thought there was going to be another ice age"

Except that the vast majority of scientists never said that, that was largely a result of false equivalence by the media of that time. See, '[The Myth of the Global Cooling Consensus](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2008BAMS2370.1)' (pdf).
Similarly, there are claims by fringe scientists that the denialist camp cherry picks such as those made by [Peter Wadhams](http://climatefeedback.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Peter-Wadhams-ice-free-arctic-claims.png) in attempts to discredit mainstream consensus.

The key point is that, contrary to what climate science denialists tout, climate models have done what most would consider to be a very reasonable job at predicting future temperatures for a considerable amount of time, and they continue to do so.  </TEXT>

There has been a huge increase in Arctic warming, and while we do see spikes in methane due to short-term temperature changes, were not seeing a long-term change in methane levels... 

The team supplemented the continuous measurements from the Barrow observatory with measurements made by a five-year, NASA-led airborne campaign known as CARVE (Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment), which helped them nail down methanes seasonal and long-term trends in the region.

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Stability of peatland carbon to rising temperatures](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13723)
___

**Abstract**:

Peatlands contain one-third of soil carbon (C), mostly buried in deep, saturated anoxic zones (catotelm). The response of catotelm C to climate forcing is uncertain, because prior experiments have focused on surface warming. We show that deep peat heating of a 2m-thick peat column results in an exponential increase in CH4 emissions. However, this response is due solely to surface processes and not degradation of catotelm peat. Incubations show that only the top 2030cm of peat from experimental plots have higher CH4 production rates at elevated temperatures. Radiocarbon analyses demonstrate that CH4 and CO2 are produced primarily from decomposition of surface-derived modern photosynthate, not catotelm C. There are no differences in microbial abundances, dissolved organic matter concentrations or degradative enzyme activities among treatments. These results suggest that although surface peat will respond to increasing temperature, the large reservoir of catotelm C is stable under current anoxic conditions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (full access): [Global risk model for vector-borne transmission of Zika virus reveals the role of El Nio 2015](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/12/13/1614303114.full)
___

**Significance**

This study quantifies the impact of climate variability on Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission by two mosquito vectors with distinct characteristics: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Observed climate data were used to dynamically drive a two vectorsone host R0 epidemiological model. Our modeling results indicate that temperature conditions related to the 2015 El Nio climate phenomenon were exceptionally conducive for mosquito-borne transmission of ZIKV over South America. The virus is believed to have entered the continent earlier in 2013. This finding implicates that such a large ZIKV outbreak occurred not solely because of the introduction of ZIKV in a naive population, but because the climatic conditions were optimal for mosquito-borne transmission of ZIKV over South America in 2015.
 
**Abstract**

Zika, a mosquito-borne viral disease that emerged in South America in 2015, was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO in February of 2016. We developed a climate-driven R0 mathematical model for the transmission risk of Zika virus (ZIKV) that explicitly includes two key mosquito vector species: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The model was parameterized and calibrated using the most up to date information from the available literature. It was then driven by observed gridded temperature and rainfall datasets for the period 19502015. We find that the transmission risk in South America in 2015 was the highest since 1950. This maximum is related to favoring temperature conditions that caused the simulated biting rates to be largest and mosquito mortality rates and extrinsic incubation periods to be smallest in 2015. This event followed the suspected introduction of ZIKV in Brazil in 2013. The ZIKV outbreak in Latin America has very likely been fueled by the 20152016 El Nio climate phenomenon affecting the region. The highest transmission risk globally is in South America and tropical countries where Ae. aegypti is abundant. Transmission risk is strongly seasonal in temperate regions where Ae. albopictus is present, with significant risk of ZIKV transmission in the southeastern states of the United States, in southern China, and to a lesser extent, over southern Europe during the boreal summer season. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Atmospheric rivers and the mass mortality of wild oysters: insight into an extreme future?](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/283/1844/20161462)
___

**Abstract**

Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and severity of extreme events. However, the biological consequences of extremes remain poorly resolved owing to their unpredictable nature and difficulty in quantifying their mechanisms and impacts. One key feature delivering precipitation extremes is an atmospheric river (AR), a long and narrow filament of enhanced water vapour transport. Despite recent attention, the biological impacts of ARs remain undocumented. Here, we use biological data coupled with remotely sensed and in situ environmental data to describe the role of ARs in the near 100% mass mortality of wild oysters in northern San Francisco Bay. In March 2011, a series of ARs made landfall within California, contributing an estimated 69.3% of the precipitation within the watershed and driving an extreme freshwater discharge into San Francisco Bay. This discharge caused sustained low salinities (less than 6.3) that almost perfectly matched the known oyster critical salinity tolerance and was coincident with a mass mortality of one of the most abundant populations throughout this species' range. This is a concern, because wild oysters remain a fraction of their historical abundance and have yet to recover. This study highlights a novel mechanism by which precipitation extremes may affect natural systems and the persistence of sensitive species in the face of environmental change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A recent question regarding sea level rise lead me to generate the following [chart](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5ix4f0/scientists_confirm_that_warm_ocean_water_is/dbc638v/). During my search for data I did come across the following which provides an excellent explanation on calculating Sea Level Rise Equivalent, SLE (i.e., the sea level equivalent if you were to completely melt said mass of ice): [Calculating glacier ice volumes and sea level equivalents](http://www.antarcticglaciers.org/glaciers-and-climate/estimating-glacier-contribution-to-sea-level-rise/)

Let's use the values he provided: 2,491mi^2 and 0.3333...mi deep. Converting units and calculating volume we get the following:

`6451.66 km^2 (square kilometers)  0.536448 km (kilometers) = 3461 km^3 (cubic kilometers)`

We're looking to use the following formula so we also need the density of glacial ice: 0.9167 kg/m^3 or 0.9167 Gt/km^3

Mass of ice (Gt) = Volume of ice (km3) x Density of ice (Gt/km3) 

 `Mass of ice (Gt) = 3461 km^3 x 0.9167 Gt/km^3 = 3172.7 Gt (metric gigatons)`

If it all melted, you would have 3172.7 Gt of water. Now we can move onto calculating SLE. As per the link provided above the formula is as follows:

SLE (mm) = mass of ice (Gt) x (1 / 361.8) 

`SLE (mm) = 3172.7 Gt x (1 / 361.8) = ~8.8mm`or 0.346456693" (inches)

<TEXT> While the addition of melt water and land water is certainly a concern (ignoring thermal expansion of the oceans we see that we would still gain a median value between 0.26m and 0.35m increase in global sea level) the largest component, as depicted in the chart, is thermal expansion. So, hypothetically speaking, yes, if no new water entered the oceans we would still see sea level rise as oceans warmed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Nacre tablet thickness records formation temperature in modern and fossil shells](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X1630646X)
___

**Abstract**:

Nacre, the iridescent outer lining of pearls and inner lining of many mollusk shells, is composed of periodic, parallel, organic sheets alternating with aragonite (CaCO3) tablet layers. Nacre tablet thickness (TT) generates both nacre's iridescence and its remarkable resistance to fracture. Despite extensive studies on how nacre forms, the mechanisms controlling TT remain unknown, even though they determine the most conspicuous of nacre's characteristics, visible even to the naked eye.

Thermodynamics predicts that temperature (T) will affect both physical and chemical components of biomineralized skeletons. The chemical composition of biominerals is well-established to record environmental parameters, and has therefore been extensively used in paleoclimate studies. The physical structure, however, has been hypothesized but never directly demonstrated to depend on the environment. Here we observe that the physical TT in nacre from modern and fossil shallow-water shells of the bivalves Pinna and Atrina correlates with T as measured by the carbonate clumped isotope thermometer. Based on the observed TT vs. T correlation, we anticipate that TT will be used as a paleothermometer, useful to estimate paleotemperature in shallow-water paleoenvironments. Here we successfully test the proposed new nacre TT thermometer on two Jurassic Pinna shells. The increase of TT with T is consistent with greater aragonite growth rate at higher T, and with greater metabolic rate at higher T. Thus, it reveals a complex, T-dependent biophysical mechanism for nacre formation. </TEXT>

**Abstract**:

Mass loss from the West Antarctic ice shelves and glaciers has been linked to basal melt by ocean heat flux. The Totten Ice Shelf in East Antarctica, which buttresses a marine-based ice sheet with a volume equivalent to at least 3.5 m of global sea-level rise, also experiences rapid basal melt, but the role of ocean forcing was not known because of a lack of observations near the ice shelf. Observations from the Totten calving front confirm that (0.22  0.07)  10^6 m^3 s^1 of warm water enters the cavity through a newly discovered deep channel. The ocean heat transport into the cavity is sufficient to support the large basal melt rates inferred from glaciological observations. Change in ocean heat flux is a plausible physical mechanism to explain past and projected changes in this sector of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and its contribution to sea level. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's called being skeptical.

No, it's ignorance, and I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt when I state that. I'm not calling you stupid (though perhaps you are, I simply don't know, hence the benefit of the doubt), I'm merely stating that you, quite obviously, lack the education required to be critical of the scientific community. Everybody is entitled to an opinion they can argue for, and the key word here is argue. You simply lack the required education to form a proper argument on the subject of climate science. Your comments are heavily strewn with inadequacy regarding science in general, and highlight your lack of comprehension, reason, and logic. One such example, out of the plethora available, is as follows where you state, 

It simply means that man (and terrestrial processes) tend to produce non-isotopic carbon.

and from another [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5iladk/without_exception_all_the_heatrelated_events/dbap5d7/) of yours:

The answer to your question, as nearly as I can tell, is that CO2 formed by burning fossil fuels contains only C12 carbon (non-isotope carbon)

Non-isotopic carbon? Seriously? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_carbon#Table You parade around like you know what you're talking about, but the truth of the matter is you don't. The sooner you acknowledge that, the better. I said it earlier, and I'll say it again, this is a prime example of the DunningKruger effect.

Anyways, I have better things to do than continue to waste my time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me preface this by stating that far smarter people than either you, or myself have worked on these theories for a large portion of their academic careers, and again, your ignorance on the subject and outright refusal to accept the above due entirely to your ignorance is what is known as the [DunningKruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).

As I have some time to spare, why not go over this.

And your point would be absolutely valid except the Seuss Effect deals primarily with carbon generated in specific ways (primarily through radiation), as it references both C14 and C13...

Firstly, it's Suess, not Seuss. Secondly, it doesn't deal at all with ^14 C. You would clearly see this, if you actually took the time to look at the figure I provided. The reason for this is because we're dealing with stable isotope geochemistry here, and the cosmogenic nuclide ^14 C is (a) unstable and (b) is present in trace amounts (0.00000000010%), compared to ^12 C (~98.89% of carbon) and ^13 C (~1.11% of carbon). Furthermore, because ^14 C is radiogenic with a relatively short half life of 5,730 years it's effectively no longer present in fossil fuels which, for the most part, formed millions of years ago - the majority of coal reserves, for example, are derived from the Carboniferous period which began ~354 million years ago.

Fossil fuels are enriched in ^12 C and poor in ^13 C, this is simply a fact of photosynthesis. Over the time frame measured, that which is of concern to the Suess Effect, the production rate of ^12 C can be reasonably justified to be constant. Similarly ^13 C can also be considered constant. The only way then to explain the negative 13C excursion is to increase the fraction of atmospheric ^12 C, and the only way to do that is to burn fossil fuels. In case you're not familiar with [13C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9413C) (or any other delta) think of it this way, the more negative (-) your delta value the lighter your composition is. Conversely, the more positive (+) your delta value the heavier the composition. In other words, a (+) excursion means you're rich in ^13 C relative to ^12 C and (-) excursion means you're rich in ^12 C relative to ^13 C.

Now, over the past 800,000 years atmospheric carbon has fluctuated between ~[170ppm and 290ppm](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/wp-content/plugins/sio-bluemoon/graphs/co2_800k.png) CO2. That should tell you something about the natural carbon sources and sinks. It's no coincidence then that the burning of fossil fuels (that means adding a large amount of ^12 C to the atmosphere), which have pushed atmospheric CO2 to values 400ppm, should coincide with a continually (-) 13C trend.

Of course there are plenty of other lines of evidence that clearly show human emissions are the cause of increased GHGs in Earth's atmosphere, and are therefore the dominant forcing behind global climate change. </TEXT>

**Too many roads**

Roads have done much to help humanity spread across the planet and maintain global movement and trade. However, roads also damage wild areas and rapidly contribute to habitat degradation and species loss. Ibisch et al. cataloged the world's roads. Though most of the world is not covered by roads, it is fragmented by them, with only 7% of land patches created by roads being greater than 100 km^2 . Furthermore, environmental protection of roadless areas is insufficient, which could lead to further degradation of the world's remaining wildernesses.

**Abstract**

Roads fragment landscapes and trigger human colonization and degradation of ecosystems, to the detriment of biodiversity and ecosystem functions. The planets remaining large and ecologically important tracts of roadless areas sustain key refugia for biodiversity and provide globally relevant ecosystem services. Applying a 1-kilometer buffer to all roads, we present a global map of roadless areas and an assessment of their status, quality, and extent of coverage by protected areas. About 80% of Earths terrestrial surface remains roadless, but this area is fragmented into ~600,000 patches, more than half of which are 1 square kilometer and only 7% of which are larger than 100 square kilometers. Global protection of ecologically valuable roadless areas is inadequate. International recognition and protection of roadless areas is urgently needed to halt their continued loss. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Fate of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation: Strong decline under continued warming and Greenland melting](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL070457/full)
___

**Abstract**:

The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment report concludes that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) could weaken substantially but is very unlikely to collapse in the 21st century. However, the assessment largely neglected Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) mass loss, lacked a comprehensive uncertainty analysis, and was limited to the 21st century. Here in a community effort, improved estimates of GrIS mass loss are included in multicentennial projections using eight state-of-the-science climate models, and an AMOC emulator is used to provide a probabilistic uncertainty assessment. We find that GrIS melting affects AMOC projections, even though it is of secondary importance. By years 20902100, the AMOC weakens by 18% [3%, 34%; 90% probability] in an intermediate greenhouse-gas mitigation scenario and by 37% [15%, 65%] under continued high emissions. Afterward, it stabilizes in the former but continues to decline in the latter to 74% [+4%, 100%] by 22902300, with a 44% likelihood of an AMOC collapse. This result suggests that an AMOC collapse can be avoided by CO2 mitigation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Centennial glacier retreat as categorical evidence of regional climate change](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2863.html)
___

**Abstract**:

The near-global retreat of glaciers over the last century provides some of the most iconic imagery for communicating the reality of anthropogenic climate change to the public. Surprisingly, however, there has not been a quantitative foundation for attributing the retreats to climate change, except in the global aggregate. This gap, between public perception and scientific basis, is due to uncertainties in numerical modelling and the short length of glacier mass-balance records. Here we present a method for assessing individual glacier change based on the signal-to-noise ratio, a robust metric that is insensitive to uncertainties in glacier dynamics. Using only meteorological and glacier observations, and the characteristic decadal response time of glaciers, we demonstrate that observed retreats of individual glaciers represent some of the highest signal-to-noise ratios of climate change yet documented. Therefore, in many places, the centennial-scale retreat of the local glaciers does indeed constitute categorical evidence of climate change. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Linking an individual glaciers retreat to climate change has remained a subject of debate. Now, using statistical techniques to analyze 37 mountain glaciers around the world, a new study finds that for most of them the observed retreat is more than 99% likely due to climate change. </TITLE>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Stratospheric solar geoengineering without ozone loss](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/12/07/1615572113.full)
___

**Significance**

The combination of emissions cuts and solar geoengineering could reduce climate risks in ways that cannot be achieved by emissions cuts alone: It could keep Earth under the 1.5-degree mark agreed at Paris, and it might stop sea level rise this century. However, this promise comes with many risks. Injection of sulfuric acid into the stratosphere, for example, would damage the ozone layer. Injection of calcite (or limestone) particles rather than sulfuric acid could counter ozone loss by neutralizing acids resulting from anthropogenic emissions, acids that contribute to the chemical cycles that destroy stratospheric ozone. Calcite aerosol geoengineering may cool the planet while simultaneously repairing the ozone layer.
 
**Abstract**

Injecting sulfate aerosol into the stratosphere, the most frequently analyzed proposal for solar geoengineering, may reduce some climate risks, but it would also entail new risks, including ozone loss and heating of the lower tropical stratosphere, which, in turn, would increase water vapor concentration causing additional ozone loss and surface warming. We propose a method for stratospheric aerosol climate modification that uses a solid aerosol composed of alkaline metal salts that will convert hydrogen halides and nitric and sulfuric acids into stable salts to enable stratospheric geoengineering while reducing or reversing ozone depletion. Rather than minimizing reactive effects by reducing surface area using high refractive index materials, this method tailors the chemical reactivity. Specifically, we calculate that injection of calcite (CaCO3) aerosol particles might reduce net radiative forcing while simultaneously increasing column ozone toward its preanthropogenic baseline. A radiative forcing of 1 Wm^2 , for example, might be achieved with a simultaneous 3.8% increase in column ozone using 2.1 Tgy^1 of 275-nm radius calcite aerosol. Moreover, the radiative heating of the lower stratosphere would be roughly 10-fold less than if that same radiative forcing had been produced using sulfate aerosol. Although solar geoengineering cannot substitute for emissions cuts, it may supplement them by reducing some of the risks of climate change. Further research on this and similar methods could lead to reductions in risks and improved efficacy of solar geoengineering methods.

<TEXT> Study: [Meltwater produced by windalbedo interaction stored in an East Antarctic ice shelf](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3180.html)
___

**Abstract**:

Surface melt and subsequent firn air depletion can ultimately lead to disintegration of Antarctic ice shelves causing grounded glaciers to accelerate and sea level to rise. In the Antarctic Peninsula, foehn winds enhance melting near the grounding line, which in the recent past has led to the disintegration of the most northerly ice shelves. Here, we provide observational and model evidence that this process also occurs over an East Antarctic ice shelf, where meltwater-induced firn air depletion is found in the grounding zone. Unlike the Antarctic Peninsula, where foehn events originate from episodic interaction of the circumpolar westerlies with the topography, in coastal East Antarctica high temperatures are caused by persistent katabatic winds originating from the ice sheets interior. Katabatic winds warm and mix the air as it flows downward and cause widespread snow erosion, explaining 3 K higher near-surface temperatures in summer and surface melt doubling in the grounding zone compared with its surroundings. Additionally, these winds expose blue ice and firn with lower surface albedo, further enhancing melt. The in situ observation of supraglacial flow and englacial storage of meltwater suggests that ice-shelf grounding zones in East Antarctica, like their Antarctic Peninsula counterparts, are vulnerable to hydrofracturing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Ground heat flux: an analytical review of 6 models evaluated at 88 sites and globally](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JG003591/full)
___

**Abstract**:

Uncertainty in ground heat flux (G) means that evaluation of the other terms in the surface energy balance (e.g., latent and sensible heat flux, LE and H) remains problematic. Algorithms that calculate LE and H require available energy, the difference between net radiation, RNET, and G. There are a wide range of approaches to model G for large-scale applications, with a subsequent wide range of estimates and accuracies. We provide the largest review of these methods to date (N=6), evaluating modeled G against measured G from 88 FLUXNET sites. The instantaneous mid-day variability in G is best captured by models forced with net radiation, while models forced by temperature show the least error at both instantaneous and daily timescales. We produce global decadal datasets of G to illustrate regional and seasonal sensitivities, as well as uncertainty. Global model mean mid-morning instantaneous G is highest during September, October, and November at 63.42 (+/- 16.84) Wm^-2 while over December, January, and February G is lowest at 53.86 (+/- 18.09) Wm^-2 but shows greater inter-model uncertainty. Results from this work have the potential to improve ET estimates and guide appropriate G model selection and development for various land uses. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Permafrost carbon, while certainly cause for concern^[1](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13653) is currently contributing a relatively small amount. Firstly, the contribution from clathrates (methane hydrate) isn't actually reaching the atmosphere^[2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1002/2016GL068999/abstract), and secondly when it comes to permafrost carbon:

<TEXT> From the article:

... you may be tempted to attribute the news about spiking atmospheric methane levels to the strong growth in domestic oil and gas drilling in the past decade ...

But without denying that there may be some growth in methane emissions from global oil and gas, the new study does not point the finger there. A substantial contribution of U.S. shale gas industry to the recent methane atmospheric increase seems unlikely, it concludes.

Rather, it notes that two thirds of the worlds methane releases come from the tropics, not the temperate latitudes, leading the researchers to single out the agricultural sector as a more likely cause of the growth  a conclusion that may prove contentious, as this remains a matter of major debate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Deglacial temperature history of West Antarctica](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/11/22/1609132113.full.pdf) (pdf)
___

**Significance**

The magnitude and timing of Antarctic temperature change through the last deglaciation reveal key aspects of Earths climate system. Prior attempts to reconstruct this history relied on isotopic indicators without absolute calibration. To overcome this limitation, we combined isotopic data with measurements of in situ temperatures along a 3.4-km-deep borehole. Deglacial warming in Antarctica was two to three times larger than the contemporaneous global temperature change, quantifying the extent to which feedback processes amplify global changes in polar regions, a key prediction of climate models. Warming progressed earlier in Antarctica than in the Northern Hemisphere but coincident with glacier recession in southern mountain ranges, a manifestation of changing oceanic heat transport, insolation, and atmospheric CO2 that can further test models.

**Abstract**

The most recent glacial to interglacial transition constitutes a remarkable natural experiment for learning how Earths climate responds to various forcings, including a rise in atmospheric CO2. This transition has left a direct thermal remnant in the polar ice sheets, where the exceptional purity and continual accumulation of ice permit analyses not possible in other settings. For Antarctica, the deglacial warming has previously been constrained only by the water isotopic composition in ice cores, without an absolute thermometric assessment of the isotopes sensitivity to temperature. To overcome this limitation, we measured temperatures in a deep borehole and analyzed them together with ice-core data to reconstruct the surface temperature history of West Antarctica. The deglacial warming was 11.31.8C, approximately two to three times the global average, in agreement with theoretical expectations for Antarctic amplification of planetary temperature changes. Consistent with evidence from glacier retreat in Southern Hemisphere mountain ranges, the Antarctic warming was mostly completed by 15 kyBP, several millennia earlier than in the Northern Hemisphere. These results constrain the role of variable oceanic heat transport between hemispheres during deglaciation and quantitatively bound the direct influence of global climate forcings on Antarctic temperature. Although climate models perform well on average in this context, some recent syntheses of deglacial climate history have underestimated Antarctic warming and the models with lowest sensitivity can be discounted.   </TEXT>

**Abstract**:

A 3 km long glacier collapsed in the morning of 17 July 2016 (Fig. 1). The avalanche killed nine herders living in their summer pasture at Aru Village, Dongru Community, Ritu County, Ali District, Xizang Autonomous Region, the most remote region on the western Tibetan Plateau. The Aru Glacier (34.03N; 82.25E), ranges in elevation from 5250 to 6150 m a.s.l. (CN5Z412C011) and is one of a glacier group that covers 27 km^2 (in 2015). The collapsed ice rushed down within 45 min (according to eyewitnesses) over the narrow tongue and swept across the gently-sloping alluvial fan, reaching the 105 km2 inland Aruco Lake (Fig. 1).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Massive remobilization of permafrost carbon during post-glacial warming](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13653)
___

**Abstract**:

Recent hypotheses, based on atmospheric records and models, suggest that permafrost carbon (PF-C) accumulated during the last glaciation may have been an important source for the atmospheric CO2 rise during post-glacial warming. However, direct physical indications for such PF-C release have so far been absent. Here we use the Laptev Sea (Arctic Ocean) as an archive to investigate PF-C destabilization during the last glacialinterglacial period. Our results show evidence for massive supply of PF-C from Siberian soils as a result of severe active layer deepening in response to the warming. Thawing of PF-C must also have brought about an enhanced organic matter respiration and, thus, these findings suggest that PF-C may indeed have been an important source of CO2 across the extensive permafrost domain. The results challenge current paradigms on the post-glacial CO2 rise and, at the same time, serve as a harbinger for possible consequences of the present-day warming of PF-C soils. </TEXT>

**Abstract**:

Explanations for the industrial epoch warming are polarized around the hypotheses of anthropogenic warming (AW) and giant natural fluctuations (GNFs). While climate sceptics have systematically attacked AW, up until now they have only invoked GNFs. This has now changed with the publication by D. Keenan of a sample of 1000 series from stochastic processes purporting to emulate the global annual temperature since 1880. While Keenan's objective was to criticize the International Panel on Climate Change's trend uncertainty analysis (their assumption that residuals are only weakly correlated), for the first time it is possible to compare a stochastic GNF model with real data. Using Haar fluctuations, probability distributions, and other techniques of time series analysis, we show that his model has unrealistically strong low-frequency variability so that even mild extrapolations imply ice ages every 1000 years. Helped by statistics, the GNF model can easily be scientifically rejected. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Greenland was nearly ice-free for extended periods during the Pleistocene](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v540/n7632/full/nature20146.html)
___

**Abstract**:

The Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) contains the equivalent of 7.4 metres of global sea-level rise1. Its stability in our warming climate is therefore a pressing concern. However, the sparse proxy evidence of the palaeo-stability of the GIS means that its history is controversial (compare refs 2 and 3 to ref. 4). Here we show that Greenland was deglaciated for extended periods during the Pleistocene epoch (from 2.6 million years ago to 11,700 years ago), based on new measurements of cosmic-ray-produced beryllium and aluminium isotopes (10Be and 26Al) in a bedrock core from beneath an ice core near the GIS summit. Models indicate that when this bedrock site is ice-free, any remaining ice is concentrated in the eastern Greenland highlands and the GIS is reduced to less than ten per cent of its current volume. Our results narrow the spectrum of possible GIS histories: the longest period of stability of the present ice sheet that is consistent with the measurements is 1.1 million years, assuming that this was preceded by more than 280,000 years of ice-free conditions. Other scenarios, in which Greenland was ice-free during any or all Pleistocene interglacials, may be more realistic. Our observations are incompatible with most existing model simulations that present a continuously existing Pleistocene GIS. Future simulations of the GIS should take into account that Greenland was nearly ice-free for extended periods under Pleistocene climate forcing.

Study: [A persistent and dynamic East Greenland Ice Sheet over the past 7.5 million years](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v540/n7632/full/nature20147.html)

**Abstract**:

Climate models show that ice-sheet melt will dominate sea-level rise over the coming centuries, but our understanding of ice-sheet variations before the last interglacial 125,000 years ago remains fragmentary. This is because terrestrial deposits of ancient glacial and interglacial periods are overrun and eroded by more recent glacial advances, and are therefore usually rare, isolated and poorly dated. In contrast, material shed almost continuously from continents is preserved as marine sediment that can be analysed to infer the time-varying state of major ice sheets. Here we show that the East Greenland Ice Sheet existed over the past 7.5 million years, as indicated by beryllium and aluminium isotopes (10Be and 26Al) in quartz sand removed by deep, ongoing glacial erosion on land and deposited offshore in the marine sedimentary record. During the early Pleistocene epoch, ice cover in East Greenland was dynamic; in contrast, East Greenland was mostly ice-covered during the mid-to-late Pleistocene. The isotope record we present is consistent with distinct signatures of changes in ice sheet behaviour coincident with major climate transitions. Although our data are continuous, they are from low-deposition-rate sites and sourced only from East Greenland. Consequently, the signal of extensive deglaciation during short, intense interglacials could be missed or blurred, and we cannot distinguish between a remnant ice sheet in the East Greenland highlands and a diminished continent-wide ice sheet. A clearer constraint on the behaviour of the ice sheet during past and, ultimately, future interglacial warmth could be produced by 10Be and 26Al records from a coring site with a higher deposition rate. Nonetheless, our analysis challenges the possibility of complete and extended deglaciation over the past several million years. </TEXT>

Models indicate that when this bedrock site is ice-free, any remaining ice is concentrated in the eastern Greenland highlands and the GIS is reduced to less than ten per cent of its current volume. Our results narrow the spectrum of possible GIS histories: the longest period of stability of the present ice sheet that is consistent with the measurements is 1.1 million years, assuming that this was preceded by more than 280,000 years of ice-free conditions. Other scenarios, in which Greenland was ice-free during any or all Pleistocene interglacials, may be more realistic. Our observations are incompatible with most existing model simulations that present a continuously existing Pleistocene GIS. Future simulations of the GIS should take into account that Greenland was nearly ice-free for extended periods under Pleistocene climate forcing.

Study: [A persistent and dynamic East Greenland Ice Sheet over the past 7.5 million years](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v540/n7632/full/nature20147.html)
___

**Abstract**:

Climate models show that ice-sheet melt will dominate sea-level rise over the coming centuries, but our understanding of ice-sheet variations before the last interglacial 125,000 years ago remains fragmentary. This is because terrestrial deposits of ancient glacial and interglacial periods are overrun and eroded by more recent glacial advances, and are therefore usually rare, isolated and poorly dated. In contrast, material shed almost continuously from continents is preserved as marine sediment that can be analysed to infer the time-varying state of major ice sheets. Here we show that the East Greenland Ice Sheet existed over the past 7.5 million years, as indicated by beryllium and aluminium isotopes (10Be and 26Al) in quartz sand removed by deep, ongoing glacial erosion on land and deposited offshore in the marine sedimentary record. During the early Pleistocene epoch, ice cover in East Greenland was dynamic; in contrast, East Greenland was mostly ice-covered during the mid-to-late Pleistocene. The isotope record we present is consistent with distinct signatures of changes in ice sheet behaviour coincident with major climate transitions. Although our data are continuous, they are from low-deposition-rate sites and sourced only from East Greenland. Consequently, the signal of extensive deglaciation during short, intense interglacials could be missed or blurred, and we cannot distinguish between a remnant ice sheet in the East Greenland highlands and a diminished continent-wide ice sheet. A clearer constraint on the behaviour of the ice sheet during past and, ultimately, future interglacial warmth could be produced by 10Be and 26Al records from a coring site with a higher deposition rate. Nonetheless, our analysis challenges the possibility of complete and extended deglaciation over the past several million years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Conservation status of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in relation to projected sea-ice declines](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/12/12/20160556)
___

**Abstract**

Loss of Arctic sea ice owing to climate change is the primary threat to polar bears throughout their range. We evaluated the potential response of polar bears to sea-ice declines by (i) calculating generation length (GL) for the species, which determines the timeframe for conservation assessments; (ii) developing a standardized sea-ice metric representing important habitat; and (iii) using statistical models and computer simulation to project changes in the global population under three approaches relating polar bear abundance to sea ice. Mean GL was 11.5 years. Ice-covered days declined in all subpopulation areas during 19792014 (median 1.26 days year^1 ). The estimated probabilities that reductions in the mean global population size of polar bears will be greater than 30%, 50% and 80% over three generations (3541 years) were 0.71 (range 0.200.95), 0.07 (range 00.35) and less than 0.01 (range 00.02), respectively. According to IUCN Red List reduction thresholds, which provide a common measure of extinction risk across taxa, these results are consistent with listing the species as vulnerable. Our findings support the potential for large declines in polar bear numbers owing to sea-ice loss, and highlight near-term uncertainty in statistical projections as well as the sensitivity of projections to different plausible assumptions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Loss of genetic diversity and increased subdivision in an endemic Alpine Stonefly threatened by climate change](https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70174171)
___

**Abstract**:

Much remains unknown about the genetic status and population connectivity of high-elevation and high-latitude freshwater invertebrates, which often persist near snow and ice masses that are disappearing due to climate change. Here we report on the conservation genetics of the meltwater stonefly Lednia tumana (Ricker) of Montana, USA, a cold-water obligate species. We sequenced 1530 bp of mtDNA from 116 L. tumana individuals representing historic (10 yr old) and 2010 populations. The dominant haplotype was common in both time periods, while the second-most-common haplotype was found only in historic samples, having been lost in the interim. The 2010 populations also showed reduced gene and nucleotide diversity and increased genetic isolation. We found lower genetic diversity in L. tumana compared to two other North American stonefly species, Amphinemura linda (Ricker) and Pteronarcys californica Newport. Our results imply small effective sizes, increased fragmentation, limited gene flow, and loss of genetic variation among contemporary L. tumana populations, which can lead to reduced adaptive capacity and increased extinction risk. This study reinforces concerns that ongoing glacier loss threatens the persistence of L. tumana, and provides baseline data and analysis of how future environmental change could impact populations of similar organisms. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [The future intensification of hourly precipitation extremes](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3168.html)
___

**Abstract**:

Extreme precipitation intensities have increased in all regions of the Contiguous United States (CONUS) and are expected to further increase with warming at scaling rates of about 7% per degree Celsius, suggesting a significant increase of flash flood hazards due to climate change. However, the scaling rates between extreme precipitation and temperature are strongly dependent on the region, temperature, and moisture availability, which inhibits simple extrapolation of the scaling rate from past climate data into the future. Here we study observed and simulated changes in local precipitation extremes over the CONUS by analysing a very high resolution (4km horizontal grid spacing) current and high-end climate scenario that realistically simulates hourly precipitation extremes. We show that extreme precipitation is increasing with temperature in moist, energy-limited, environments and decreases abruptly in dry, moisture-limited, environments. This novel framework explains the large variability in the observed and modelled scaling rates and helps with understanding the significant frequency and intensity increases in future hourly extreme precipitation events and their interaction with larger scales. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my haste to submit the article I didn't cross check with the study itself, but rather copied a paragraph from the article - trimming it to fit the 300 word limit. 

A new Yale-led study in the journal Nature finds that warming will drive the loss of at least 55 trillion kilograms of carbon from the soil by mid-century, or about 17% more than the projected emissions due to human-related activities during that period. That would be roughly the equivalent of adding to the planet another industrialized country the size of the United States.

The correct statement, however, is quite obviously the statement within the abstract. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Rapid warming is not conductive to human civilization, especially not modern society. You've stated it incorrectly, it's a *stable* climate (ie. the Holocene) that has *contributed* to the development of civilizations, not rapid warming.

Global warming occurs far more rapidly than global cooling - to put it simply, the collapse of ice sheets occurs far more rapidly than the growth of an ice sheet. It is rapid warming that is more commonly attributed to extinction events and die offs. 

rapid climate changes associated with interstadial warming events are strongly associated with the regional replacement/extinction of major genetic clades or species of megafauna - [figure](http://i.imgur.com/LUmTnWo.png)   [paper](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2015/07/22/science.aac4315)

Glacial periods, relative to the Pleistocene, occur when atmospheric CO2 falls below ~280ppm, and the onset of the next "**inevitable**" glacial period has been delayed by human emissions for tens if not hundreds of thousands of years.^[1](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v529/n7585/full/nature16494.html), ^[2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2004GC000891/abstract).   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Quantifying global soil carbon losses in response to warming](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v540/n7631/full/nature20150.html)
___

**Abstract**

The majority of the Earths terrestrial carbon is stored in the soil. If anthropogenic warming stimulates the loss of this carbon to the atmosphere, it could drive further planetary warming. Despite evidence that warming enhances carbon fluxes to and from the soil, the net global balance between these responses remains uncertain. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of warming-induced changes in soil carbon stocks by assembling data from 49 field experiments located across North America, Europe and Asia. We find that the effects of warming are contingent on the size of the initial soil carbon stock, with considerable losses occurring in high-latitude areas. By extrapolating this empirical relationship to the global scale, we provide estimates of soil carbon sensitivity to warming that may help to constrain Earth system model projections. Our empirical relationship suggests that global soil carbon stocks in the upper soil horizons will fall by 30  30 petagrams of carbon to 203  161 petagrams of carbon under one degree of warming, depending on the rate at which the effects of warming are realized. Under the conservative assumption that the response of soil carbon to warming occurs within a year, a business-as-usual climate scenario would drive the loss of 55  50 petagrams of carbon from the upper soil horizons by 2050. This value is around 1217 per cent of the expected anthropogenic emissions over this period. Despite the considerable uncertainty in our estimates, the direction of the global soil carbon response is consistent across all scenarios. This provides strong empirical support for the idea that rising temperatures will stimulate the net loss of soil carbon to the atmosphere, driving a positive land carbonclimate feedback that could accelerate climate change.

**Abstract**:

Visualization of climate data plays an integral role in the communication of climate change findings to both expert and non-expert audiences. The cognitive and psychological sciences can provide valuable insights into how to improve visualization of climate data based on knowledge of how the human brain processes visual and linguistic information. We review four key research areas to demonstrate their potential to make data more accessible to diverse audiences: directing visual attention, visual complexity, making inferences from visuals, and the mapping between visuals and language. We present evidence-informed guidelines to help climate scientists increase the accessibility of graphics to non-experts, and illustrate how the guidelines can work in practice in the context of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change graphics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (**open access**): [Estimating the extent of Antarctic summer sea ice during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration](http://www.the-cryosphere.net/10/2721/2016/)
___

**Abstract**:

In stark contrast to the sharp decline in Arctic sea ice, there has been a steady increase in ice extent around Antarctica during the last three decades, especially in the Weddell and Ross seas.

___

**Abstract**:

 In stark contrast to the sharp decline in Arctic sea ice, there has been a steady increase in ice extent around Antarctica during the last three decades, especially in the Weddell and Ross seas. In general, climate models do not to capture this trend and a lack of information about sea ice coverage in the pre-satellite period limits our ability to quantify the sensitivity of sea ice to climate change and robustly validate climate models. However, evidence of the presence and nature of sea ice was often recorded during early Antarctic exploration, though these sources have not previously been explored or exploited until now. We have analysed observations of the summer sea ice edge from the ship logbooks of explorers such as Robert Falcon Scott, Ernest Shackleton and their contemporaries during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration (18971917), and in this study we compare these to satellite observations from the period 19892014, offering insight into the ice conditions of this period, from direct observations, for the first time.

<TEXT> Study: [Sub-ice-shelf sediments record history of twentieth-century retreat of Pine Island Glacier](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature20136.html)
___

**Abstract**:

The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is one of the largest potential sources of rising sea levels. Over the past 40 years, glaciers flowing into the Amundsen Sea sector of the ice sheet have thinned at an accelerating rate, and several numerical models suggest that unstable and irreversible retreat of the grounding linewhich marks the boundary between grounded ice and floating ice shelfis underway. Understanding this recent retreat requires a detailed knowledge of grounding-line history, but the locations of the grounding line before the advent of satellite monitoring in the 1990s are poorly dated. In particular, a history of grounding-line retreat is required to understand the relative roles of contemporaneous ocean-forced change and of ongoing glacier response to an earlier perturbation in driving ice-sheet loss. Here we show that the present thinning and retreat of Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica is part of a climatically forced trend that was triggered in the 1940s. Our conclusions arise from analysis of sediment cores recovered beneath the floating Pine Island Glacier ice shelf, and constrain the date at which the grounding line retreated from a prominent seafloor ridge. We find that incursion of marine water beyond the crest of this ridge, forming an ocean cavity beneath the ice shelf, occurred in 1945 (12 years); final ungrounding of the ice shelf from the ridge occurred in 1970 (4 years). The initial opening of this ocean cavity followed a period of strong warming of West Antarctica, associated with El Nio activity. Thus our results suggest that, even when climate forcing weakened, ice-sheet retreat continued. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Determination of active travel speed for minimum air pollution inhalation](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15568318.2016.1238984?scroll=top needAccess=true)
___

**Abstract**

A higher active travel speed has offsetting impacts on air pollution inhalation dose through higher breathing rate but shorter exposure duration. The net effect of speed choice on inhalation dose for pedestrians and bicyclists has not been established. This paper derives equations for pedestrian and bicycle steady-state minimum dose speed (MDS). Parameter distributions from the literature are applied to a synthetic population of travelers to calculate individual MDS. Results strongly support the existence of a definable MDS, which is near observed travel speeds for urban pedestrians and bicyclists. For a wide range of travelers the MDS is 26 km/hr while walking and 1220 km/hr while bicycling, decreasing with road grade at a rate similar to observed speeds. On level ground, pedestrian and bicycle MDS corresponds to a moderate intensity physical activity level (36 MET). Small deviations from the MDS have little effect, but large deviations (by more than 10 km/hr for bicycling) can more than double inhalation dose over a fixed distance. It appears that pedestrians and bicyclists choose travel speeds that approximately minimize pollution inhalation dose, although pollution is unlikely a primary motivation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Abrupt reorganization of North Pacific and western North American climate during the last deglaciation](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL071244/full)
___

**Abstract**:

Dramatic hydroclimate shifts occurred in western North America during the last deglaciation, but the timing and mechanisms driving these changes are uncertain and debated, and previous modeling has largely relied on linear interpolations between equilibrium snapshot simulations. Using a published transient climate simulation and a range of proxy records, we analyze the region's climate evolution in order to identify the mechanisms governing hydroclimate shifts. A rapid loss of ice around 14,000 years ago causes an abrupt reorganization of the circulation, which precipitates drying and moistening of southwestern and northwestern North America, respectively. The atmospheric circulation transitions between two states on a timescale of decades to centuries, during which time the westerly jet shifts north by about 7. In contrast to previous studies, we find that changes in the water budget of western North America prior to this event are not attributable to variations in the position of the jet, but rather to the intensity of moisture transport into the continent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (**open access**): [The global warming hiatus: Slowdown or redistribution?](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016EF000417/full)
___

**Abstract**:

Global mean surface temperatures (GMST) exhibited a smaller rate of warming during 19982013, compared to the warming in the latter half of the 20th Century. Although, not a true hiatus in the strict definition of the word, this has been termed the global warming hiatus by IPCC (2013). There have been other periods that have also been defined as the hiatus depending on the analysis. There are a number of uncertainties and knowledge gaps regarding the hiatus. This report reviews these issues and also posits insights from a collective set of diverse information that helps us understand what we do and do not know. One salient insight is that the GMST phenomenon is a surface characteristic that does not represent a slowdown in warming of the climate system but rather is an energy redistribution within the oceans. Improved understanding of the ocean distribution and redistribution of heat will help better monitor Earth's energy budget and its consequences. A review of recent scientific publications on the hiatus shows the difficulty and complexities in pinpointing the oceanic sink of the missing heat from the atmosphere and the upper layer of the oceans, which defines the hiatus. Advances in hiatus research and outlooks (recommendations) are given in this report. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Persistent shift of the Arctic polar vortex towards the Eurasian continent in recent decades](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3136.html)
___


**Abstract**:

The wintertime Arctic stratospheric polar vortex has weakened over the past three decades, and consequently cold surface air from high latitudes is now more likely to move into the middle latitudes. However, it is not known if the location of the polar vortex has also experienced a persistent change in response to Arctic climate change and whether any changes in the vortex position have implications for the climate system. Here, through the analysis of various data sets and model simulations, we show that the Arctic polar vortex shifted persistently towards the Eurasian continent and away from North America in February over the past three decades. This shift is found to be closely related to the enhanced zonal wavenumber-1 waves in response to Arctic sea-ice loss, particularly over the BarentsKara seas (BKS). Increased snow cover over the Eurasian continent may also have contributed to the shift. Our analysis reveals that the vortex shift induces cooling over some parts of the Eurasian continent and North America which partly offsets the tropospheric climate warming there in the past three decades. The potential vortex shift in response to persistent sea-ice loss in the future, and its associated climatic impact, deserve attention to better constrain future climate changes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Improving photosynthesis and crop productivity by accelerating recovery from photoprotection](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6314/857)
___

**Abstract**

Crop leaves in full sunlight dissipate damaging excess absorbed light energy as heat. When sunlit leaves are shaded by clouds or other leaves, this protective dissipation continues for many minutes and reduces photosynthesis. Calculations have shown that this could cost field crops up to 20% of their potential yield. Here, we describe the bioengineering of an accelerated response to natural shading events in Nicotiana (tobacco), resulting in increased leaf carbon dioxide uptake and plant dry matter productivity by about 15% in fluctuating light. Because the photoprotective mechanism that has been altered is common to all flowering plants and crops, the findings provide proof of concept for a route to obtaining a sustainable increase in productivity for food crops and a much-needed yield jump. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Impact of global warming on the rise of volcanic plumes and implications for future volcanic aerosol forcing](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JD025405/full)
___

**Abstract**:

Volcanic eruptions have a significant impact on climate when they inject sulfur gases into the stratosphere. The dynamics of eruption plumes is also affected by climate itself, as atmospheric stratification impacts plumes height. We use an integral plume model to assess changes in volcanic plume maximum rise heights as a consequence of global warming, with atmospheric conditions from an ensemble of global climate models (GCM), using three representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios. Predicted changes in atmospheric temperature profiles decrease the heights of tropospheric and lowermost stratospheric volcanic plumes and increase the tropopause height, for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios in the coming three centuries. Consequently, the critical mass eruption rate required to cross the tropopause increases by up to a factor 3 for tropical regions, and up to 2 for high-latitude regions. A number of recent lower stratospheric plumes, mostly in the tropics (e.g., Merapi, 2010), would be expected to not cross the tropopause starting from the late 21st century, under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenario. This effect could result in a 5  25% decrease in the average SO2 flux into the stratosphere carried by small plumes, which frequency is larger than the rate of decay of volcanic stratospheric aerosol, and a 2  12% decrease of the total flux. Our results suggest the existence of a positive feedback between climate and volcanic aerosol forcing. Such feedback may have minor implications for global warming rate but can prove to be important to understand the long-term evolution of volcanic atmospheric inputs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Abrupt summer warming and changes in temperature extremes over Northeast Asia since the mid-1990s: Drivers and physical processes](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00376-016-5247-3)
___

**Abstract**:

This study investigated the drivers and physical processes for the abrupt decadal summer surface warming and increases in hot temperature extremes that occurred over Northeast Asia in the mid-1990s. Observations indicate an abrupt increase in summer mean surface air temperature (SAT) over Northeast Asia since the mid-1990s. Accompanying this abrupt surface warming, significant changes in some temperature extremes, characterized by increases in summer mean daily maximum temperature (Tmax), daily minimum temperature (Tmin), annual hottest day temperature (TXx), and annual warmest night temperature (TNx) were observed. There were also increases in the frequency of summer days (SU) and tropical nights (TR). Atmospheric general circulation model experiments forced by changes in sea surface temperature (SST)/sea ice extent (SIE), anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, and anthropogenic aerosol (AA) forcing, relative to the period 196493, reproduced the general patterns of observed summer mean SAT changes and associated changes in temperature extremes, although the abrupt decrease in precipitation since the mid-1990s was not simulated. Additional model experiments with different forcings indicated that changes in SST/SIE explained 76% of the area-averaged summer mean surface warming signal over Northeast Asia, while the direct impact of changes in GHG and AA explained the remaining 24% of the surface warming signal. Analysis of physical processes indicated that the direct impact of the changes in AA (through aerosolradiation and aerosolcloud interactions), mainly related to the reduction of AA precursor emissions over Europe, played a dominant role in the increase in TXx and a similarly important role as SST/SIE changes in the increase in the frequency of SU over Northeast Asia via AA-induced coupled atmosphereland surface and cloud feedbacks, rather than through a direct impact of AA changes on cloud condensation nuclei. The modelling results also imply that the abrupt summer surface warming and increases in hot temperature extremes over Northeast Asia since the mid-1990s will probably sustain in the next few decades as GHG concentrations continue to increase and AA precursor emissions over both North America and Europe continue to decrease. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [On the recent destabilization of the Gulf Stream path downstream of Cape Hatteras](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL069966/full)
___

**Abstract**:

Mapped satellite altimetry reveals interannual variability in the position of initiation of Gulf Stream meanders downstream of Cape Hatteras. The longitude where the Gulf Stream begins meandering varies by 1500km. There has been a general trend for the destabilization point to shift west, and 5 of the last 6years had a Gulf Stream destabilization point upstream of the New England Seamounts. Independent in situ data suggest that this shift has increased both upper-ocean/deep-ocean interaction events at Line W and open-ocean/shelf interactions across the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB) shelf break. Mooring data and along-track altimetry indicate a recent increase in the number of deep cyclones that stir Deep Western Boundary Current waters from the MAB slope into the deep interior. Temperature profiles from the Oleander Program suggest that recent enhanced warming of the MAB shelf may be related to shifts in the Gulf Stream's destabilization point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Climatic drivers for multidecadal shifts in solute transport and methane production zones within a large peat basin](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GB005397/abstract)
___

**Abstract**:

Northern peatlands are an important source for greenhouse gases, but their capacity to produce methane remains uncertain under changing climatic conditions. We therefore analyzed a 43year time series of the pore-water chemistry to determine if long-term shifts in precipitation altered the vertical transport of solutes within a large peat basin in northern Minnesota. These data suggest that rates of methane production can be finely tuned to multidecadal shifts in precipitation that drive the vertical penetration of labile carbon substrates within the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands. Tritium and cation profiles demonstrate that only the upper meter of these peat deposits was flushed by downwardly moving recharge from 1965 to 1983 during a Transitional Dry-to-Moist Period. However, a shift to a moister climate after 1984 drove surface waters much deeper, largely flushing the pore waters of all bogs and fens to depths of 2m. Labile carbon compounds were transported downward from the rhizosphere to the basal peat at this time producing a substantial enrichment of methane in 14C with respect to the solid-phase peat from 1991 to 2008. These data indicate that labile carbon substrates can fuel deep production zones of methanogenesis that more than doubled in thickness across this large peat basin after 1984. Moreover, the entire peat profile apparently has the capacity to produce methane from labile carbon substrates depending on climate-driven modes of solute transport. Future changes in precipitation may therefore play a central role in determining the source strength of peatlands in the global methane cycle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Reorientation and faulting of Pluto due to volatile loading within Sputnik Planitia](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature20120.html)

**Abstract**:

Pluto is an astoundingly diverse, geologically dynamic world. The dominant feature is Sputnik Planitiaa tear-drop-shaped topographic depression approximately 1,000 kilometres in diameter possibly representing an ancient impact basin. The interior of Sputnik Planitia is characterized by a smooth, craterless plain three to four kilometres beneath the surrounding rugged uplands, and represents the surface of a massive unit of actively convecting volatile ices (N2, CH4 and CO) several kilometres thick. This large feature is very near the PlutoCharon tidal axis. Here we report that the location of Sputnik Planitia is the natural consequence of the sequestration of volatile ices within the basin and the resulting reorientation (true polar wander) of Pluto. Loading of volatile ices within a basin the size of Sputnik Planitia can substantially alter Plutos inertia tensor, resulting in a reorientation of the dwarf planet of around 60 degrees with respect to the rotational and tidal axes. The combination of this reorientation, loading and global expansion due to the freezing of a possible subsurface ocean generates stresses within the planets lithosphere, resulting in a global network of extensional faults that closely replicate the observed fault networks on Pluto. Sputnik Planitia probably formed northwest of its present location, and was loaded with volatiles over million-year timescales as a result of volatile transport cycles on Pluto. Plutos past, present and future orientation is controlled by feedbacks between volatile sublimation and condensation, changing insolation conditions and Plutos interior structure.

Study: [Reorientation of Sputnik Planitia implies a subsurface ocean on Pluto](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature20148.html)

**Abstract**:

The deep nitrogen-covered basin on Pluto, informally named Sputnik Planitia, is located very close to the longitude of Plutos tidal axis and may be an impact feature, by analogy with other large basins in the Solar System. Reorientation of Sputnik Planitia arising from tidal and rotational torques can explain the basins present-day location, but requires the feature to be a positive gravity anomaly, despite its negative topography. Here we argue that if Sputnik Planitia did indeed form as a result of an impact and if Pluto possesses a subsurface ocean, the required positive gravity anomaly would naturally result because of shell thinning and ocean uplift, followed by later modest nitrogen deposition. Without a subsurface ocean, a positive gravity anomaly requires an implausibly thick nitrogen layer (exceeding 40 kilometres). To prolong the lifetime of such a subsurface ocean to the present day and to maintain ocean uplift, a rigid, conductive water-ice shell is required. Because nitrogen deposition is latitude-dependent, nitrogen loading and reorientation may have exhibited complex feedbacks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Recent acceleration in coastal cliff retreat rates on the south coast of Great Britain](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/11/02/1613044113)
___


**Significance**:

Cliffed coasts erode when attacked by energetic waves. Cliff retreat threatens coastal assets and livelihoods. Understanding rates of past erosion is vital to quantifying these risks, particularly when confronted with expected increases in storminess and sea level, and given continued human occupation and engineering of coastal regions. Historical observations of cliff retreat span 150 y at most. We derived past cliff retreat rates over millennial time scales for chalk cliffs on the south coast of Great Britain by interpreting measured cosmogenic nuclides with numerical models. Our results provide evidence for accelerated erosion in recent centuries, which we suggest is driven by reduced sediment supply and thinning of beaches in the face of environmental and anthropogenic changes.

**Abstract**:

Rising sea levels and increased storminess are expected to accelerate the erosion of soft-cliff coastlines, threatening coastal infrastructure and livelihoods. To develop predictive models of future coastal change we need fundamentally to know how rapidly coasts have been eroding in the past, and to understand the driving mechanisms of coastal change. Direct observations of cliff retreat rarely extend beyond 150 y, during which humans have significantly modified the coastal system. Cliff retreat rates are unknown in prior centuries and millennia. In this study, we derived retreat rates of chalk cliffs on the south coast of Great Britain over millennial time scales by coupling high-precision cosmogenic radionuclide geochronology and rigorous numerical modeling. Measured ^10 Be concentrations on rocky coastal platforms were compared with simulations of coastal evolution using a Monte Carlo approach to determine the most likely history of cliff retreat. The ^10 Be concentrations are consistent with retreat rates of chalk cliffs that were relatively slow (26 cmy^1 ) until a few hundred years ago. Historical observations reveal that retreat rates have subsequently accelerated by an order of magnitude (2232 cmy^1 ). We suggest that acceleration is the result of thinning of cliff-front beaches, exacerbated by regional storminess and anthropogenic modification of the coast.

<TEXT> Report: [Unbreakable : Building the Resilience of the Poor in the Face of Natural Disasters](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/25335)
___

Economic losses from natural disasters totaled $92 billion in 2015. Such statements, all too commonplace, assess the severity of disasters by no other measure than the damage inflicted on buildings, infrastructure, and agricultural production. But $1 in losses does not mean the same thing to a rich person that it does to a poor person; the gravity of a $92 billion loss depends on who experiences it. By focusing on aggregate lossesthe traditional approach to disaster riskwe restrict our consideration to how disasters affect those wealthy enough to have assets to lose in the first place, and largely ignore the plight of poor people. This report moves beyond asset and production losses and shifts its attention to how natural disasters affect peoples well-being. Disasters are far greater threats to well-being than traditional estimates suggest. This approach provides a more nuanced view of natural disasters than usual reporting, and a perspective that takes fuller account of poor peoples vulnerabilities. Poor people suffer only a fraction of economic losses caused by disasters, but they bear the brunt of their consequences. Understanding the disproportionate vulnerability of poor people also makes the case for setting new intervention priorities to lessen the impact of natural disasters on the worlds poor, such as expanding financial inclusion, disaster risk and health insurance, social protection and adaptive safety nets, contingent finance and reserve funds, and universal access to early warning systems. Efforts to reduce disaster risk and poverty go hand in hand. Because disasters impoverish so many, disaster risk management is inseparable from poverty reduction policy, and vice versa. As climate change magnifies natural hazards, and because protection infrastructure alone cannot eliminate risk, a more resilient population has never been more critical to breaking the cycle of disaster-induced poverty. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suspect you are actually referring to the study by Zwally et al which was more about growth of ice within Antarctica's interior. The following (from a previous comment of mine) should help explain:
___

About a year go now the Zwally et al. (NASA) paper came out. Polar ice refers to ice within the polar regions, both in the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere. There is no question regarding the decline of the Greenland Ice Sheet, glaciers, or Arctic Sea Ice. When it comes to the southern hemisphere, glacial mass is in decline, as is the Antarctic Ice Sheet (land ice); however, Antarctic Sea Ice has shown limited growth.

The picture gets somewhat complicated because some regions of Antarctica are gaining mass while others are losing mass. In general, the ice shelves and outlet glaciers in western Antarctica are losing mass while those in eastern Antarctica have been gaining   losing mass (see [map](https://i.imgur.com/hQEU9kS.jpg))^[1](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6232/327).

When it comes to the interior of Antarctica; however, the NASA study (Zwally et al.) argued for an increase in ice mass within the western interior of Antarctica which is at odds with a plethora of other studies that find the opposite trend (see [figure](http://www.realclimate.org/images//Antarctic_MassBalance_.png)).

While the data Zwally used only extended to 2008 he did have the following to say: 

Were essentially in agreement with other studies that show an increase in ice discharge in the Antarctic Peninsula and the Thwaites and Pine Island region of West Antarctica, said Jay Zwally... Our main disagreement is for East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica  there, we see an ice gain that exceeds the losses in the other areas.

The Zwally et al. study is [heavily disputed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/11/05/a-controversial-nasa-study-says-antarctica-is-gaining-ice-heres-why-you-should-stay-skeptical/?utm_term=.acf49c62d653) and one should always be skeptical of a single study that contradicts countless others.  </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Collectively, reservoirs created by dams are thought to be an important source of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere. So far, efforts to quantify, model, and manage these emissions have been limited by data availability and inconsistencies in methodological approach. Here, we synthesize reservoir CH4, CO2, and N2O emission data with three main objectives: (1) to generate a global estimate of GHG emissions from reservoirs, (2) to identify the best predictors of these emissions, and (3) to consider the effect of methodology on emission estimates. We estimate that GHG emissions from reservoir water surfaces account for 0.8 (0.51.2) Pg CO2 equivalents per year, with the majority of this forcing due to CH4. We then discuss the potential for several alternative pathways such as dam degassing and downstream emissions to contribute significantly to overall emissions. Although prior studies have linked reservoir GHG emissions to reservoir age and latitude, we find that factors related to reservoir productivity are better predictors of emission.  </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere  the global carbon budget  is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe data sets and methodology to quantify all major components of the global carbon budget, including their uncertainties, based on the combination of a range of data, algorithms, statistics, and model estimates and their interpretation by a broad scientific community. We discuss changes compared to previous estimates and consistency within and among components, alongside methodology and data limitations. CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry (EFF) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, respectively, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on combined evidence from land-cover change data, fire activity associated with deforestation, and models. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its rate of growth (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The mean ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is based on observations from the 1990s, while the annual anomalies and trends are estimated with ocean models. The variability in SOCEAN is evaluated with data products based on surveys of ocean CO2 measurements. The global residual terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated by the difference of the other terms of the global carbon budget and compared to results of independent dynamic global vegetation models. We compare the mean land and ocean fluxes and their variability to estimates from three atmospheric inverse methods for three broad latitude bands. All uncertainties are reported as 1, reflecting the current capacity to characterise the annual estimates of each component of the global carbon budget. For the last decade available (20062015), EFF was 9.3  0.5 GtC yr^1 , ELUC 1.0  0.5 GtC yr^1 , GATM 4.5  0.1 GtC yr^1 , SOCEAN 2.6  0.5 GtC yr^1 , and SLAND 3.1  0.9 GtC yr^1 . For year 2015 alone, the growth in EFF was approximately zero and emissions remained at 9.9  0.5 GtC yr^^1 , showing a slowdown in growth of these emissions compared to the average growth of 1.8 % yr^1 that took place during 20062015. Also, for 2015, ELUC was 1.3  0.5 GtC yr^1 , GATM was 6.3  0.2 GtC yr^1 , SOCEAN was 3.0  0.5 GtC yr^1 , and SLAND was 1.9  0.9 GtC yr^1 . GATM was higher in 2015 compared to the past decade (20062015), reflecting a smaller SLAND for that year. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 399.4  0.1 ppm averaged over 2015. For 2016, preliminary data indicate the continuation of low growth in EFF with +0.2 % (range of 1.0 to +1.8 %) based on national emissions projections for China and USA, and projections of gross domestic product corrected for recent changes in the carbon intensity of the economy for the rest of the world. In spite of the low growth of EFF in 2016, the growth rate in atmospheric CO2 concentration is expected to be relatively high because of the persistence of the smaller residual terrestrial sink (SLAND) in response to El Nio conditions of 20152016. From this projection of EFF and assumed constant ELUC for 2016, cumulative emissions of CO2 will reach 565  55 GtC (2075  205 GtCO2) for 18702016, about 75 % from EFF and 25 % from ELUC. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new carbon budget compared with previous publications of this data set (Le Qur et al., 2015b, a, 2014, 2013). All observations presented here can be downloaded from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (doi:10.3334/CDIAC/GCP_2016). </TEXT>

<TEXT> The chemical weathering rates presented here represent an average over the past 150Myr. Mars may currently be experiencing an interglacial period and probably the driest conditions in equatorial regions. But over the last 10Myr this may have been preceded by several glacial intervals and a change from a low mean obliquity to a high mean obliquity period. For the majority of the time there may therefore have been more moisture at the equatorial latitudes of Meridiani than at present.

Are the authors suggesting that interglacial periods are more arid than glacial periods on Mars? On Earth, glacial periods are denoted by an increase in dust flux (loess deposits) as water is locked away in ice sheets / caps / glaciers and conditions become more arid, with interglacial periods indicated by warmer conditions and subsequently wetter conditions.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [An advanced modeling study on the impacts and atmospheric implications of multiphase dimethyl sulfide chemistry](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/42/11776)
___


**Significance**:

Climate models indicate the importance of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) oxidation in new aerosol particle formation and the activation of cloud condensation nuclei over oceans. These effects contribute to strong natural negative radiative forcing and substantially influence the Earths climate. However, the DMS oxidation pathway is not well-represented, because earlier model studies only parameterized gas-phase DMS oxidation and neglected multiphase chemistry. Here, we performed the most comprehensive current mechanistic studies on multiphase DMS oxidation. The studies imply that neglecting multiphase chemistry leads to significant overestimation of SO2 production and subsequent new particle formation. These findings show that an advanced treatment of multiphase DMS chemistry is necessary to improve marine atmospheric chemistry and climate model predictions.

**Abstract**:

Oceans dominate emissions of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), the major natural sulfur source. DMS is important for the formation of non-sea salt sulfate (nss-SO4^2 ) aerosols and secondary particulate matter over oceans and thus, significantly influence global climate. The mechanism of DMS oxidation has accordingly been investigated in several different model studies in the past. However, these studies had restricted oxidation mechanisms that mostly underrepresented important aqueous-phase chemical processes. These neglected but highly effective processes strongly impact direct product yields of DMS oxidation, thereby affecting the climatic influence of aerosols. To address these shortfalls, an extensive multiphase DMS chemistry mechanism, the Chemical Aqueous Phase Radical Mechanism DMS Module 1.0, was developed and used in detailed model investigations of multiphase DMS chemistry in the marine boundary layer. The performed model studies confirmed the importance of aqueous-phase chemistry for the fate of DMS and its oxidation products. Aqueous-phase processes significantly reduce the yield of sulfur dioxide and increase that of methyl sulfonic acid (MSA), which is needed to close the gap between modeled and measured MSA concentrations. Finally, the simulations imply that multiphase DMS oxidation produces equal amounts of MSA and sulfate, a result that has significant implications for nss-SO4^2 aerosol formation, cloud condensation nuclei concentration, and cloud albedo over oceans. Our findings show the deficiencies of parameterizations currently used in higher-scale models, which only treat gas-phase chemistry. Overall, this study shows that treatment of DMS chemistry in both gas and aqueous phases is essential to improve the accuracy of model predictions.

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Amazonian chemical weathering rate derived from stony meteorite finds at Meridiani Planum on Mars](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13459)
___

**Abstract**:

Spacecraft exploring Mars such as the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity, as well as the Mars Science Laboratory or Curiosity rover, have accumulated evidence for wet and habitable conditions on early Mars more than 3 billion years ago. Current conditions, by contrast, are cold, extremely arid and seemingly inhospitable. To evaluate exactly how dry todays environment is, it is important to understand the ongoing current weathering processes. Here we present chemical weathering rates determined for Mars. We use the oxidation of iron in stony meteorites investigated by the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity at Meridiani Planum. Their maximum exposure age is constrained by the formation of Victoria crater and their minimum age by erosion of the meteorites. The chemical weathering rates thus derived are 1 to 4 orders of magnitude slower than that of similar meteorites found in Antarctica where the slowest rates are observed on Earth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Glacial isostatic uplift of the European Alps](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13382)
___

**Abstract**:

Following the last glacial maximum (LGM), the demise of continental ice sheets induced crustal rebound in tectonically stable regions of North America and Scandinavia that is still ongoing. Unlike the ice sheets, the Alpine ice cap developed in an orogen where the measured uplift is potentially attributed to tectonic shortening, lithospheric delamination and unloading due to deglaciation and erosion. Here we show that 90% of the geodetically measured rock uplift in the Alps can be explained by the Earths viscoelastic response to LGM deglaciation. We modelled rock uplift by reconstructing the Alpine ice cap, while accounting for postglacial erosion, sediment deposition and spatial variations in lithospheric rigidity. Clusters of excessive uplift in the Rhne Valley and in the Eastern Alps delineate regions potentially affected by mantle processes, crustal heterogeneity and active tectonics. Our study shows that even small LGM ice caps can dominate present-day rock uplift in tectonically active regions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [A brainspine interface alleviating gait deficits after spinal cord injury in primates](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v539/n7628/full/nature20118.html)
___

**Abstract**:

Spinal cord injury disrupts the communication between the brain and the spinal circuits that orchestrate movement. To bypass the lesion, braincomputer interfaces have directly linked cortical activity to electrical stimulation of muscles, and have thus restored grasping abilities after hand paralysis. Theoretically, this strategy could also restore control over leg muscle activity for walking. However, replicating the complex sequence of individual muscle activation patterns underlying natural and adaptive locomotor movements poses formidable conceptual and technological challenges. Recently, it was shown in rats that epidural electrical stimulation of the lumbar spinal cord can reproduce the natural activation of synergistic muscle groups producing locomotion. Here we interface leg motor cortex activity with epidural electrical stimulation protocols to establish a brainspine interface that alleviated gait deficits after a spinal cord injury in non-human primates. Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were implanted with an intracortical microelectrode array in the leg area of the motor cortex and with a spinal cord stimulation system composed of a spatially selective epidural implant and a pulse generator with real-time triggering capabilities. We designed and implemented wireless control systems that linked online neural decoding of extension and flexion motor states with stimulation protocols promoting these movements. These systems allowed the monkeys to behave freely without any restrictions or constraining tethered electronics. After validation of the brainspine interface in intact (uninjured) monkeys, we performed a unilateral corticospinal tract lesion at the thoracic level. As early as six days post-injury and without prior training of the monkeys, the brainspine interface restored weight-bearing locomotion of the paralysed leg on a treadmill and overground. The implantable components integrated in the brainspine interface have all been approved for investigational applications in similar human research, suggesting a practical translational pathway for proof-of-concept studies in people with spinal cord injury. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [The broad footprint of climate change from genes to biomes to people](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6313/aaf7671)
___

**Accumulating impacts**:

Anthropogenic climate change is now in full swing, our global average temperature already having increased by 1C from preindustrial levels. Many studies have documented individual impacts of the changing climate that are particular to species or regions, but individual impacts are accumulating and being amplified more broadly. Scheffers et al. review the set of impacts that have been observed across genes, species, and ecosystems to reveal a world already undergoing substantial change. Understanding the causes, consequences, and potential mitigation of these changes will be essential as we move forward into a warming world.

**Structured Abstract**:

BACKGROUND:

Climate change impacts have now been documented across every ecosystem on Earth, despite an average warming of only ~1C so far. Here, we describe the full range and scale of climate change effects on global biodiversity that have been observed in natural systems. To do this, we identify a set of core ecological processes (32 in terrestrial and 31 each in marine and freshwater ecosystems) that underpin ecosystem functioning and support services to people. Of the 94 processes considered, 82% show evidence of impact from climate change in the peer-reviewed literature. Examples of observed impacts from meta-analyses and case studies go beyond well-established shifts in species ranges and changes to phenology and population dynamics to include disruptions that scale from the gene to the ecosystem.

ADVANCES:

Species are undergoing evolutionary adaptation to temperature extremes, and climate change has substantial impacts on species physiology that include changes in tolerances to high temperatures, shifts in sex ratios in species with temperature-dependent sex determination, and increased metabolic costs of living in a warmer world. These physiological adjustments have observable impacts on morphology, with many species in both aquatic and terrestrial systems shrinking in body size because large surface-to-volume ratios are generally favored under warmer conditions. Other morphological changes include reductions in melanism to improve thermoregulation, and altered wing and bill length in birds.

Broader-scale responses to climate change include changes in the phenology, abundance, and distribution of species. Temperate plants are budding and flowering earlier in spring and later in autumn. Comparable adjustments have been observed in marine and freshwater fish spawning events and in the timing of seasonal migrations of animals worldwide. Changes in the abundance and age structure of populations have also been observed, with widespread evidence of range expansion in warm-adapted species and range contraction in cold-adapted species. As a by-product of species redistributions, novel community interactions have emerged. Tropical and boreal species are increasingly incorporated into temperate and polar communities, respectively, and when possible, lowland species are increasingly assimilating into mountain communities. Multiplicative impacts from gene to community levels scale up to produce ecological regime shifts, in which one ecosystem state shifts to an alternative state.

OUTLOOK:

The many observed impacts of climate change at different levels of biological organization point toward an increasingly unpredictable future for humans. Reduced genetic diversity in crops, inconsistent crop yields, decreased productivity in fisheries from reduced body size, and decreased fruit yields from fewer winter chill events threaten food security. Changes in the distribution of disease vectors alongside the emergence of novel pathogens and pests are a direct threat to human health as well as to crops, timber, and livestock resources. Humanity depends on intact, functioning ecosystems for a range of goods and services. Enhanced understanding of the observed impacts of climate change on core ecological processes is an essential first step to adapting to them and mitigating their influence on biodiversity and ecosystem service provision.

Impacts can be measured on multiple processes at different levels of biological organization within ecosystems. In total, 82% of 94 ecological processes show evidence of being affected by climate change. Within levels of organization, the percentage of processes impacted varies from 60% for genetics to 100% for species distribution. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

In the ongoing debate about the climate benefits of fuel switching from coal to natural gas for power generation, the metrics used to model climate impacts may be important. In this article, we evaluate the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of coal and natural gas used in new, advanced power plants using a broad set of available climate metrics in order to test for the robustness of results. Climate metrics included in the article are global warming potential, global temperature change potential, technology warming potential, and cumulative radiative forcing. We also used the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC) climate-change model to validate the results. We find that all climate metrics suggest a natural gas combined cycle plant offers life cycle climate benefits over 100 years compared to a pulverized coal plant, even if the life cycle methane leakage rate for natural gas reaches 5%. Over shorter time frames (i.e., 20 years), plants using natural gas with a 4% leakage rate have similar climate impacts as those using coal, but are no worse than coal. If carbon capture and sequestration becomes available for both types of power plants, natural gas still offers climate benefits over coal as long as the life cycle methane leakage rate remains below 2%. These results are consistent across climate metrics and the MAGICC model over a 100-year time frame. Although it is not clear whether any of these metrics are better than the others, the choice of metric can inform decisions based on different societal values. For example, whereas annual temperature change reported may be a more relevant metric to evaluate the human health effects of increased heat, the cumulative temperature change may be more relevant to evaluate climate impacts, such as sea-level rise, that will result from the cumulative warming. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Global mean surface temperatures are rising in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The magnitude of this warming at equilibrium for a given radiative forcingreferred to as specific equilibrium climate sensitivity (S)is still subject to uncertainties. We estimate global mean temperature variations and S using a 784,000-year-long field reconstruction of sea surface temperatures and a transient paleoclimate model simulation. Our results reveal that S is strongly dependent on the climate background state, with significantly larger values attained during warm phases. Using the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 for future greenhouse radiative forcing, we find that the range of paleo-based estimates of Earths future warming by 2100 CE overlaps with the upper range of climate simulations conducted as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Furthermore, we find that within the 21st century, global mean temperatures will very likely exceed maximum levels reconstructed for the last 784,000 years. On the basis of temperature data from eight glacial cycles, our results provide an independent validation of the magnitude of current CMIP5 warming projections. </TEXT>

**Abstract**:

Terrestrial ecosystems play a significant role in the global carbon cycle and offset a large fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The terrestrial carbon sink is increasing, yet the mechanisms responsible for its enhancement, and implications for the growth rate of atmospheric CO2, remain unclear. Here using global carbon budget estimates, ground, atmospheric and satellite observations, and multiple global vegetation models, we report a recent pause in the growth rate of atmospheric CO2, and a decline in the fraction of anthropogenic emissions that remain in the atmosphere, despite increasing anthropogenic emissions. We attribute the observed decline to increases in the terrestrial sink during the past decade, associated with the effects of rising atmospheric CO2 on vegetation and the slowdown in the rate of warming on global respiration. The pause in the atmospheric CO2 growth rate provides further evidence of the roles of CO2 fertilization and warming-induced respiration, and highlights the need to protect both existing carbon stocks and regions, where the sink is growing rapidly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Civil conflict sensitivity to growing-season drought](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/44/12391.full)
___

**Significance**:

Understanding the conflict potential of drought is critical for dealing effectively with the societal implications of climate change. Using new georeferenced ethnicity and conflict data for Asia and Africa since 1989, we present an actor-oriented analysis of growing-season drought and conflict involvement among ethnic groups. Results from naive models common in previous research suggest that drought generally has little impact. However, context-sensitive models accounting for the groups level of vulnerability reveal that drought can contribute to sustaining conflict, especially for agriculturally dependent groups and politically excluded groups in very poor countries. These results suggest a reciprocal naturesociety interaction in which violent conflict and environmental shock constitute a vicious circle, each phenomenon increasing the groups vulnerability to the other.
 
**Abstract**:

To date, the research community has failed to reach a consensus on the nature and significance of the relationship between climate variability and armed conflict. We argue that progress has been hampered by insufficient attention paid to the context in which droughts and other climatic extremes may increase the risk of violent mobilization. Addressing this shortcoming, this study presents an actor-oriented analysis of the droughtconflict relationship, focusing specifically on politically relevant ethnic groups and their sensitivity to growing-season drought under various political and socioeconomic contexts. To this end, we draw on new conflict event data that cover Asia and Africa, 19892014, updated spatial ethnic settlement data, and remote sensing data on agricultural land use. Our procedure allows quantifying, for each ethnic group, drought conditions during the growing season of the locally dominant crop. A comprehensive set of multilevel mixed effects models that account for the groups livelihood, economic, and political vulnerabilities reveals that a drought under most conditions has little effect on the short-term risk that a group challenges the state by military means. However, for agriculturally dependent groups as well as politically excluded groups in very poor countries, a local drought is found to increase the likelihood of sustained violence. We interpret this as evidence of the reciprocal relationship between drought and conflict, whereby each phenomenon makes a group more vulnerable to the other.

<TEXT> Study: [Coastal sea level rise with warming above 2 C](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/11/02/1605312113.abstract)
___

**Significance**

Warming of 2 C will lead to an average global ocean rise of 20 cm, but more than 90% of coastal areas will experience greater rises. If warming continues above 2 C, then, by 2100, sea level will be rising faster than at any time during human civilization, and 80% of the global coastline is expected to exceed the 95th percentile upper limit of 1.8 m for mean global ocean sea level rise. Coastal communities, notably rapidly expanding cities in the developing world; small island states; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Cultural World Heritage sites; and vulnerable tropical coastal ecosystems will have a very limited time after midcentury to adapt to these rises.

**Abstract**

Two degrees of global warming above the preindustrial level is widely suggested as an appropriate threshold beyond which climate change risks become unacceptably high. This 2 C threshold is likely to be reached between 2040 and 2050 for both Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 and 4.5. Resulting sea level rises will not be globally uniform, due to ocean dynamical processes and changes in gravity associated with water mass redistribution. Here we provide probabilistic sea level rise projections for the global coastline with warming above the 2 C goal. By 2040, with a 2 C warming under the RCP8.5 scenario, more than 90% of coastal areas will experience sea level rise exceeding the global estimate of 0.2 m, with up to 0.4 m expected along the Atlantic coast of North America and Norway. With a 5 C rise by 2100, sea level will rise rapidly, reaching 0.9 m (median), and 80% of the coastline will exceed the global sea level rise at the 95th percentile upper limit of 1.8 m. Under RCP8.5, by 2100, New York may expect rises of 1.09 m, Guangzhou may expect rises of 0.91 m, and Lagos may expect rises of 0.90 m, with the 95th percentile upper limit of 2.24 m, 1.93 m, and 1.92 m, respectively. The coastal communities of rapidly expanding cities in the developing world, and vulnerable tropical coastal ecosystems, will have a very limited time after midcentury to adapt to sea level rises unprecedented since the dawn of the Bronze Age. </TEXT>

___

**Significance**

Warming of 2 C will lead to an average global ocean rise of 20 cm, but more than 90% of coastal areas will experience greater rises. If warming continues above 2 C, then, by 2100, sea level will be rising faster than at any time during human civilization, and 80% of the global coastline is expected to exceed the 95th percentile upper limit of 1.8 m for mean global ocean sea level rise. Coastal communities, notably rapidly expanding cities in the developing world; small island states; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Cultural World Heritage sites; and vulnerable tropical coastal ecosystems will have a very limited time after midcentury to adapt to these rises.

___

**Abstract**:

Arctic sea ice is retreating rapidly, raising prospects of a future ice-free Arctic Ocean during summer. Since climate-model simulations of the sea-ice loss differ substantially, we here use a robust linear relationship between monthly-mean September sea-ice area and cumulative CO2 emissions to infer the future evolution of Arctic summer sea ice directly from the observational record. The observed linear relationship implies a sustained loss of 3  0.3 m^2 of September sea-ice area per metric ton of CO2 emission. Based on this sensitivity, Arctic sea-ice will be lost throughout September for an additional 1000 Gt of CO2 emissions. Most models show a lower sensitivity, which is possibly linked to an underestimation of the modeled increase in incoming longwave radiation and of the modeled Transient Climate Response. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Article: [Water strategies for the next administration](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6312/555)
___

**Summary**: 

Issues around fresh water are not particularly high on the U.S. political agenda. They should be. Water problems directly threaten food production, fisheries, energy generation, foreign policy, public health, and international security. Access to safe, sufficient, and affordable water is vital to well-being and to the economy. Yet U.S. water systems, once the envy of the world, are falling into disrepair, and new threats loom. Drinking water disasters in Flint, Michigan, droughts and floods increasingly attributable to anthropogenic climate change (1), and growing violence worldwide over water offer a glimpse of what we face unless new efforts are made to address failing infrastructure, worsening climate conditions, and ineffective policies and regulations (2). Yet, if there is any issue that offers the opportunity for nonpartisan agreement, it is to create and implement a 21st-century national water policy. In that vein, I detail national and international water challenges and recommendations for the next U.S. president, administration, and Congress. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Postglacial viability and colonization in North Americas ice-free corridor](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v537/n7618/full/nature19085.html)
___

**Abstract**:

During the Last Glacial Maximum, continental ice sheets isolated Beringia (northeast Siberia and northwest North America) from unglaciated North America. By around 15 to 14 thousand calibrated radiocarbon years before present (cal. kyr bp), glacial retreat opened an approximately 1,500-km-long corridor between the ice sheets. It remains unclear when plants and animals colonized this corridor and it became biologically viable for human migration. We obtained radiocarbon dates, pollen, macrofossils and metagenomic DNA from lake sediment cores in a bottleneck portion of the corridor. We find evidence of steppe vegetation, bison and mammoth by approximately 12.6 cal. kyr bp, followed by open forest, with evidence of moose and elk at about 11.5 cal. kyr bp, and boreal forest approximately 10cal. kyr bp. Our findings reveal that the first Americans, whether Clovis or earlier groups in unglaciated North America before 12.6cal. kyr bp, are unlikely to have travelled by this route into the Americas. However, later groups may have used this northsouth passageway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Amplified plant turnover in response to climate change forecast by Late Quaternary records](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3146.html)
___

**Abstract**:

Conservation decisions are informed by twenty-first-century climate impact projections that typically predict high extinction risk. Conversely, the palaeorecord shows strong sensitivity of species abundances and distributions to past climate changes, but few clear instances of extinctions attributable to rising temperatures. However, few studies have incorporated palaeoecological data into projections of future distributions. Here we project changes in abundance and conservation status under a climate warming scenario for 187 European and North American plant taxa using niche-based models calibrated against taxaclimate relationships for the past 21,000 years. We find that incorporating long-term data into niche-based models increases the magnitude of projected future changes for plant abundances and community turnover. The larger projected changes in abundances and community turnover translate into different, and often more threatened, projected IUCN conservation status for declining tree taxa, compared with traditional approaches. An average of 18.4% (North America) and 15.5% (Europe) of taxa switch IUCN categories when compared with single-time model results. When taxa categorized as Least Concern are excluded, the palaeo-calibrated models increase, on average, the conservation threat status of 33.2% and 56.8% of taxa. Notably, however, few models predict total disappearance of taxa, suggesting resilience for these taxa, if climate were the only extinction driver. Long-term studies linking palaeorecords and forecasting techniques have the potential to improve conservation assessments. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Departures from eustasy in Pliocene sea-level records](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v4/n5/full/ngeo1118.html)
___

**Abstract**:

Proxy data suggest that atmospheric CO2 levels during the middle of the Pliocene epoch (about 3Myr ago) were similar to today, leading to the use of this interval as a potential analogue for future climate change. Estimates for mid-Pliocene sea levels range from 10 to 40m above present, and a value of +25m is often adopted in numerical climate model simulations. A eustatic change of such magnitude implies the complete deglaciation of the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, and significant loss of mass in the East Antarctic ice sheet. However, the effects of glacial isostatic adjustments have not been accounted for in Pliocene sea-level reconstructions. Here we numerically model these effects on Pliocene shoreline features using a gravitationally self-consistent treatment of post-glacial sea-level change. We find that the predicted modern elevation of Pliocene shoreline features can deviate significantly from the eustatic signal, even in the absence of subsequent tectonically-driven movements of the Earths surface. In our simulations, this non-eustatic sea-level change, at individual locations, is caused primarily by residual isostatic adjustments associated with late Pleistocene glaciation. We conclude that a combination of model results and field observations can help to better constrain sea level in the past, and hence lend insight into the stability of ice sheets under varying climate conditions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Regional and global benthic 18O stacks for the last glacial cycle](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016PA003002/full)
___

**Abstract**:

Although detailed age models exist for some marine sediment records of the last glacial cycle (0150ka), age models for many cores rely on the stratigraphic correlation of benthic 18O, which measures ice volume and deep ocean temperature change. The large amount of data available for the last glacial cycle offers the opportunity to improve upon previous benthic 18O compilations, such as the LR04 global stack. Not only are the age constraints for the LR04 stack now outdated but a single global alignment target neglects regional differences of several thousand years in the timing of benthic 18O change during glacial terminations. Here we present regional stacks that characterize mean benthic 18O change for 8 ocean regions and a volume-weighted global stack of data from 263 cores. Age models for these stacks are based on radiocarbon data from 0 to 40ka, correlation to a layer-counted Greenland ice core from 40 to 56ka, and correlation to radiometrically dated speleothems from 56 to 150ka. The regional 18O stacks offer better stratigraphic alignment targets than the LR04 global stack and, furthermore, suggest that the LR04 stack is biased 12kyr too young throughout the Pleistocene. Finally, we compare global and regional benthic 18O responses with sea level estimates for the last glacial cycle. </TEXT>

Study: [Deep time evidence for climate sensitivity increase with warming](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL069243/full)
___

**Abstract**:

Future global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions will depend on climate feedbacks, the effect of which is expressed by climate sensitivity, the warming for a doubling of atmospheric CO2 content. It is not clear how feedbacks, sensitivity, and temperature will evolve in our warming world, but past warming events may provide insight. Here we employ paleoreconstructions and new climate-carbon model simulations in a novel framework to explore a wide scenario range for the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) carbon release and global warming event 55.8 Ma ago, a possible future warming analogue. We obtain constrained estimates of CO2 and climate sensitivity before and during the PETM and of the PETM carbon input amount and nature. Sensitivity increased from 3.35.6 to 3.76.5 K (Kelvin) into the PETM. When taken together with Last Glacial Maximum and modern estimates, this result indicates climate sensitivity increase with global warming.*   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Impact of decadal cloud variations on the Earths energy budget](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2828.html)
___

**Abstract**:

Feedbacks of clouds on climate change strongly influence the magnitude of global warming. Cloud feedbacks, in turn, depend on the spatial patterns of surface warming, which vary on decadal timescales. Therefore, the magnitude of the decadal cloud feedback could deviate from the long-term cloud feedback. Here we present climate model simulations to show that the global mean cloud feedback in response to decadal temperature fluctuations varies dramatically due to time variations in the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature. We find that cloud anomalies associated with these patterns significantly modify the Earths energy budget. Specifically, the decadal cloud feedback between the 1980s and 2000s is substantially more negative than the long-term cloud feedback. This is a result of cooling in tropical regions where air descends, relative to warming in tropical ascent regions, which strengthens low-level atmospheric stability. Under these conditions, low-level cloud cover and its reflection of solar radiation increase, despite an increase in global mean surface temperature. These results suggest that sea surface temperature pattern-induced low cloud anomalies could have contributed to the period of reduced warming between 1998 and 2013, and offer a physical explanation of why climate sensitivities estimated from recently observed trends are probably biased low. </TEXT>

Proterozoic climate dynamics, including both remarkable climate stability during the mid-Proterozoic and extreme low-latitude glaciation in the Neoproterozoic, must be understood in the framework of evolving oxidant reservoirs throughout the Precambrian. We present Earth system model simulations showing that recent constraints on atmospheric oxygen and oceanic sulfate during Proterozoic time have profound implications for marine methane cycling and the accumulation of methane in the atmosphere. Our model results challenge the paradigm of persistently elevated methane during the Precambrian, thus extending the relevance of the faint young Sun paradox throughout the Proterozoic. In light of the possibility of low methane during the mid-Proterozoic, we also suggest a conceptual model for the relationship between oxygenation, methane, and Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth events.

**Abstract**:

Pervasive anoxia in the subsurface ocean during the Proterozoic may have allowed large fluxes of biogenic CH4 to the atmosphere, enhancing the climatic significance of CH4 early in Earths history. Indeed, the assumption of elevated pCH4 during the Proterozoic underlies most models for both anomalous climatic stasis during the mid-Proterozoic and extreme climate perturbation during the Neoproterozoic; however, the geologic record cannot directly constrain atmospheric CH4 levels and attendant radiative forcing. Here, we revisit the role of CH4 in Earths climate system during Proterozoic time. We use an Earth system model to quantify CH4 fluxes from the marine biosphere and to examine the capacity of biogenic CH4 to compensate for the faint young Sun during the boring billion years before the emergence of metazoan life. Our calculations demonstrate that anaerobic oxidation of CH4 coupled to SO42 reduction is a highly effective obstacle to CH4 accumulation in the atmosphere, possibly limiting atmospheric pCH4 to less than 10 ppm by volume for the second half of Earth history regardless of atmospheric pO2. If recent pO2 constraints from Cr isotopes are correct, we predict that reduced UV shielding by O3 should further limit pCH4 to very low levels similar to those seen today. Thus, our model results likely limit the potential climate warming by CH4 for the majority of Earth historypossibly reviving the faint young Sun paradox during Proterozoic time and challenging existing models for the initiation of low-latitude glaciation that depend on the oxidative collapse of a steady-state CH4 greenhouse.

<TEXT> Study: [Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2016/10/26/science.aaf2649)
___

**Abstract**:

Fundamental questions remain about the origin of newly formed atmospheric aerosol particles because data from laboratory measurements have been insufficient to build global models. In contrast, gas-phase chemistry models have been based on laboratory kinetics measurements for decades. Here we build a global model of aerosol formation using extensive laboratory-measured nucleation rates involving sulfuric acid, ammonia, ions and organic compounds. The simulations and a comparison with atmospheric observations show that nearly all nucleation throughout the present-day atmosphere involves ammonia or biogenic organic compounds in addition to sulfuric acid. A significant fraction of nucleation involves ions, but the relatively weak dependence on ion concentrations indicates that for the processes studied variations in cosmic ray intensity do not significantly affect climate via nucleation in the present-day atmosphere. </TEXT>

**Abstract**:

Are continuing changes in the Arctic influencing wind patterns and the occurrence of extreme weather events in northern mid-latitudes? The chaotic nature of atmospheric circulation precludes easy answers. The topic is a major science challenge, as continued Arctic temperature increases are an inevitable aspect of anthropogenic climate change. We propose a perspective that rejects simple cause-and-effect pathways and notes diagnostic challenges in interpreting atmospheric dynamics. We present a way forward based on understanding multiple processes that lead to uncertainties in Arctic and mid-latitude weather and climate linkages. We emphasize community coordination for both scientific progress and communication to a broader public.

<TEXT> Study: [Impact of ocean resolution on coupled air-sea fluxes and large-scale climate](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL070559/abstract)
___

**Abstract**:

Air-sea fluxes are a crucial component in the energetics of the global climate system. The largest air-sea fluxes occur in regions of high sea surface temperature variability, such as ocean boundary, frontal currents and eddies. In this paper we explore the importance of ocean model resolution to resolve air-sea flux relationships in these areas. We examine the sea surface temperature-wind stress relationship in high-pass filtered observations and two versions of the Met Office climate model with eddy-permitting and eddy-resolving ocean resolutions. Eddy-resolving resolution shows marginal improvement in the relationship over eddy-permitting resolution. However, by focussing on the North Atlantic we show that the eddy-resolving model has significant enhancement of latent heat loss over the North Atlantic Current region, a long-standing model bias. While eddy-resolving resolution does not change the air-sea flux relationship at small scale, the impact on the mean state has important implications for the reliability of future climate projections. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

This study compares the simulation of subseasonal tropical variability by a set of six state-of-the-art AGCMs in two experiments in aquaplanet configuration: a zonally symmetric experiment, and an experiment with a warm pool centered on the equator. In all six models, the presence of the warm pool generates zonal asymmetries in the simulated mean states in the form of a Gill-type response, made more complex by feedbacks between moisture, convective heating and circulation. Noticeable differences appear from one model to another. Only half the models simulate mean low-level equatorial westerlies over the warm pool area. The presence of the warm pool can also favor the development of large-scale variability consistent with observed Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) characteristics, but this happens only in half the models. Our results do not support the idea that the presence of the warm pool and/or of mean low-level equatorial westerlies are sufficient conditions for MJO-like variability to arise in the models. Comparing spectral characteristics of the simulated Convectively Coupled Equatorial Waves (CCEWs) in the aquaplanet experiments and the corresponding coupled atmosphere-ocean (i.e., CMIP) and atmosphere-only (i.e., AMIP) simulations, we also show that there is more consistency for a given model across its configurations, than for a given configuration across the six models. Overall, our results confirm that the simulation of subseasonal variability by given model is significantly influenced by the parameterization of subgrid physical processes (most-likely cloud processes), both directly and through modulation of the mean state. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been shown to influence the global carbon sink by increasing the fraction of diffuse light, which increases photosynthesis over a greater fraction of the vegetated canopy. Between 1995 and 2013, U.S. SO2 emissions declined by over 70%, coinciding with observed AOD reductions of 3.00.6% yr^1 over the eastern U.S. In the Community Earth System Model (CESM), these trends cause diffuse light to decrease regionally by almost 0.6% yr^1 , leading to declines in gross primary production (GPP) of 0.07% yr^1 . Integrated over the analysis period and domain, this represents 0.5 PgC of omitted GPP. A separate upscaling calculation that used published relationships between GPP and diffuse light agreed with the CESM model results within 20%. The agreement between simulated and data-constrained upscaling results strongly suggests that anthropogenic sulfate trends have a small impact on carbon uptake in temperate forests due to scattered light. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Optimal bioenergy power generation for climate change mitigation with or without carbon sequestration](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13160)
___

**Abstract**:

Restricting global warming below 2 C to avoid catastrophic climate change will require atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Current integrated assessment models (IAMs) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios assume that CDR within the energy sector would be delivered using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Although bioenergy-biochar systems (BEBCS) can also deliver CDR, they are not included in any IPCC scenario. Here we show that despite BECCS offering twice the carbon sequestration and bioenergy per unit biomass, BEBCS may allow earlier deployment of CDR at lower carbon prices when long-term improvements in soil fertility offset biochar production costs. At carbon prices above $1,000 Mg^1 C, BECCS is most frequently (P0.45, calculated as the fraction of Monte Carlo simulations in which BECCS is the most cost effective) the most economic biomass technology for climate-change mitigation. At carbon prices below $1,000 Mg^1 C, BEBCS is the most cost-effective technology only where biochar significantly improves agricultural yields, with pure bioenergy systems being otherwise preferred. </TEXT>

**A warming limit for the Mediterranean basin**:

Pollen cores from sediments provide rich detail on the history of vegetation and climate in the Mediterranean during the Holocene (the most recent ~10,000 years). Guiot and Cramer used this information as a baseline against which to compare predictions of future climate and vegetation under different climate-change scenarios. Vegetation and land-use systems observed in the Holocene records may persist under a 1.5C warming above preindustrial temperature levels. A 2C warming, however, is likely over the next century to produce ecosystems in the Mediterranean basin that have no analog in the past 10,000 years.

**Abstract**:

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement of December 2015 aims to maintain the global average warming well below 2C above the preindustrial level. In the Mediterranean basin, recent pollen-based reconstructions of climate and ecosystem variability over the past 10,000 years provide insights regarding the implications of warming thresholds for biodiversity and land-use potential. We compare scenarios of climate-driven future change in land ecosystems with reconstructed ecosystem dynamics during the past 10,000 years. Only a 1.5C warming scenario permits ecosystems to remain within the Holocene variability. At or above 2C of warming, climatic change will generate Mediterranean land ecosystem changes that are unmatched in the Holocene, a period characterized by recurring precipitation deficits rather than temperature anomalies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Sharpening vision by adapting to flicker](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/10/12/1609330113.abstract)
___

**Significance**:

Distinct anatomical visual pathways can be traced through the human central nervous system. These have been linked to specialized functions, such as encoding information about spatial forms (like the human face and text) and stimulus dynamics (flicker or movement). Our experiments are inconsistent with this strict division. They show that mechanisms responsive to flicker can alter form perception, with vision transiently sharpened by weakening the influence of flicker-sensitive mechanisms by prolonged exposure to flicker. So, next time you are trying to read fine print, you might be well advised to first view a flickering stimulus!

**Abstract**:

Human vision is surprisingly malleable. A static stimulus can seem to move after prolonged exposure to movement (the motion aftereffect), and exposure to tilted lines can make vertical lines seem oppositely tilted (the tilt aftereffect). The paradigm used to induce such distortions (adaptation) can provide powerful insights into the computations underlying human visual experience. Previously spatial form and stimulus dynamics were thought to be encoded independently, but here we show that adaptation to stimulus dynamics can sharpen form perception. We find that fast flicker adaptation (FFAd) shifts the tuning of face perception to higher spatial frequencies, enhances the acuity of spatial visionallowing people to localize inputs with greater precision and to read finer scaled text, and it selectively reduces sensitivity to coarse-scale form signals. These findings are consistent with two interrelated influences: FFAd reduces the responsiveness of magnocellular neurons (which are important for encoding dynamics, but can have poor spatial resolution), and magnocellular responses contribute coarse spatial scale information when the visual system synthesizes form signals. Consequently, when magnocellular responses are mitigated via FFAd, human form perception is transiently sharpened because blur signals are mitigated.

<TEXT> what forms of life can survive on a planet with 500ppm of CO2

Plenty. More recently, geologically speaking, most of the Oligocene and all of the Eocene were [well above 500ppm CO2](https://d29qn7q9z0j1p6.cloudfront.net/content/roypta/371/2001/20130096/F5.large.jpg?width=800 height=600 carousel=1) (see: [A 40-million-year history of atmospheric CO2](http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/2001/20130096)) with temperatures [far higher than present values](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/All_palaeotemps.svg). That's not to say life can easily adapt and to our current episode of abrupt climate change, but merely that life is fully capable of existing above 500ppm CO2.

and are we one of them?

<TEXT> 20,000 years refers to the time span over which the majority of species were lost, however, the series of episodes that build the Permo-Triassic extinction event occurred over a much longer interval:

Many geologists and paleontologists contend that the Permian extinction occurred over the course of 15 million years during the latter part of the Permian Period (299 million to 252 million years ago). However, others claim that the extinction interval was much more rapid, lasting only about 200,000 years, with the bulk of the species loss occurring over a 20,000-year span near the end of the period. - [Permian extinction](https://www.britannica.com/science/Permian-extinction) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is discussed in [The Sea-Level Fingerprint of West Antarctic Collapse](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5915/753.full?rss=1) (open access) amongst others:

The rapid melting of ice sheets and glaciers leads to a sea-level change that departs dramatically from the assumption of a uniform redistribution of meltwater (4). An ice sheet exerts a gravitational attraction on the nearby ocean and thus draws water toward it. If the ice sheet melts, this attraction will be reduced, and water will migrate away from the ice sheet. The net effect, despite the increase in the total volume of the oceans after a melting event, is that sea level will actually fall within 2000 km of the collapsing ice sheet and progressively increase as one moves further from this region. Each ice reservoir will produce a distinct geometry, or fingerprint, of sea-level change.

Here it is illustrated: With [initial conditions](https://i.imgur.com/VhJjMzI.png) and [post melt](https://i.imgur.com/QZwxhVi.png).

<TEXT> Lithospheric plates are highly variable in their breadth, and their thickness (young oceanic lithosphere ~15km thick, while ancient continental lithosphere can be upwards of ~200km thick). Ice Sheets are massive, and as such they have a noticeable gravitational pull on the immediate surrounding oceans. Hypothetically speaking, should both ice sheets disappear sea level would actually drop around Greenland and Antarctica, while increasing elsewhere. 

With the removal of the ice sheets, the lithosphere, in those regions, will rebound (isostatic rebound). As the lithosphere rises, there is less pressure which induces melting (known as decompression melting) and with increased melt there exists the possibility for increased volcanism as has been documented at the end of the last glacial period^[1](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/increase-in-volcanic-eruptions-at-the-end-of-the-ice-age-caused-by-melting-ice-caps-and-glacial) (aka the Ice Age). Motion of the lithosphere also results in seismic activity. For example, much of the recorded seismic activity within North America's interior (Canadian Shield for example) is a result of ongoing post-glacial rebound since the rapid deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet ~11,700 years ago.

Volcanic injection of aerosol into the stratosphere does cool the climate in the short run; however, volcanic gases include GHGs such as CO2 which persist far longer in Earth's atmosphere than aerosols. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Sensitivity of Pine Island Glacier to observed ocean forcing](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL070500/full)
___

**Abstract**:

We present subannual observations (20092014) of a major West Antarctic glacier (Pine Island Glacier) and the neighboring ocean. Ongoing glacier retreat and accelerated ice flow were likely triggered a few decades ago by increased ocean-induced thinning, which may have initiated marine ice-sheet instability. Following a subsequent 60% drop in ocean heat content from early 2012 to late 2013, ice flow slowed, but by4%, with flow recovering as the ocean warmed to prior temperatures. During this cold-ocean period, the evolving glacier-bed/ice-shelf system was also in a geometry favorable to stabilization. However, despite a minor, temporary decrease in ice discharge, the basin-wide thinning signal did not change. Thus, as predicted by theory, once marine ice-sheet instability is underway, a single transient high-amplitude ocean cooling has only a relatively minor effect on ice flow. The long-term effects of ocean-temperature variability on ice flow, however, are not yet known. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Glacier change and glacial lake outburst flood risk in the Bolivian Andes](http://www.the-cryosphere.net/10/2399/2016/)
___

**Abstract**:

Glaciers of the Bolivian Andes represent an important water resource for Andean cities and mountain communities, yet relatively little work has assessed changes in their extent over recent decades. In many mountain regions, glacier recession has been accompanied by the development of proglacial lakes, which can pose a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) hazard. However, no studies have assessed the development of such lakes in Bolivia despite recent GLOF incidents here. Our mapping from satellite imagery reveals an overall areal shrinkage of 228.122.8km^2 (43.1%) across the Bolivian Cordillera Oriental between 1986 and 2014. Shrinkage was greatest in the Tres Cruces region (47.3%), followed by the Cordillera Apolobamba (43.1%) and Cordillera Real (41.9%). A growing number of proglacial lakes have developed as glaciers have receded, in accordance with trends in most other deglaciating mountain ranges, although the number of ice-contact lakes has decreased. The reasons for this are unclear, but the pattern of lake change has varied significantly throughout the study period, suggesting that monitoring of future lake development is required as ice continues to recede. Ultimately, we use our 2014 database of proglacial lakes to assess GLOF risk across the Bolivian Andes. We identify 25 lakes that pose a potential GLOF threat to downstream communities and infrastructure. We suggest that further studies of potential GLOF impacts are urgently required. </TEXT>

From the abstract which I also provided ITT:

We estimate rates of climatic niche change in 236 species and compare these with rates of projected climate change by 2070. Our results show that projected climate change is consistently faster than rates of niche change in grasses, typically by more than 5000-fold for temperature-related variables.

As for grasses surviving "*several mass extinction events*" that's (a) false and (b) misleading

<TEXT> Study: [A progressively wetter climate in southern East Africa over the past 1.3 million years](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v537/n7619/full/nature19065.html)
___

**Abstract**:

African climate is generally considered to have evolved towards progressively drier conditions over the past few million years, with increased variability as glacialinterglacial change intensified worldwide. Palaeoclimate records derived mainly from northern Africa exhibit a 100,000-year (eccentricity) cycle overprinted on a pronounced 20,000-year (precession) beat, driven by orbital forcing of summer insolation, global ice volume and long-lived atmospheric greenhouse gases. Here we present a 1.3-million-year-long climate history from the Lake Malawi basin (1014 S in eastern Africa), which displays strong 100,000-year (eccentricity) cycles of temperature and rainfall following the Mid-Pleistocene Transition around 900,000 years ago. Interglacial periods were relatively warm and moist, while ice ages were cool and dry. The Malawi record shows limited evidence for precessional variability, which we attribute to the opposing effects of austral summer insolation and the temporal/spatial pattern of sea surface temperature in the Indian Ocean. The temperature history of the Malawi basin, at least for the past 500,000 years, strongly resembles past changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and terrigenous dust flux in the tropical Pacific Ocean, but not in global ice volume. Climate in this sector of eastern Africa (unlike northern Africa) evolved from a predominantly arid environment with high-frequency variability to generally wetter conditions with more prolonged wet and dry intervals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In regard to /u/planktic's comment Cullen *et al* state the following, from their paper [Climate change and the collapse of the Akkadian empire: 
Evidence from the deep sea](http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~peter/site/Papers_files/Cullen.et.al.2000.pdf) (pdf):

All available evidence indicates that this event records a dramatic mid-Holocene change in regional climate and is not a depositional artifact due to sediment disturbance or redeposition.

As for a causal mechanism, Claussen *et al* suggest the following:

... our  results  indicate  that  the  long-term cooling  and  drying  from  mid-Holocene  to  present-day  is
triggered  by  subtle  changes  in  the  Earth's  orbit. However, the abrupt desertication in North Africa during the
mid-Holocene  can  be  explained  only  in  terms  of  internal, mainly regional, vegetation-atmosphere feedbacks in the climate system whereas the timing of this event depends on the state of the global climate system.  Further experiments are necessary to more precisely quantify the contribution of low latitudes versus  high northern latitudes, oceanic feedbacks versus biospheric feedbacks, to the timing. - [Simulation of an abrupt change in Saharan vegetation

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Hemispherically asymmetric volcanic forcing of tropical hydroclimate during the last millennium](http://www.earth-syst-dynam.net/7/681/2016/)
___

**Abstract**:

Volcanic aerosols exert the most important natural radiative forcing of the last millennium. State-of-the-art paleoclimate simulations of this interval are typically forced with diverse spatial patterns of volcanic forcing, leading to different responses in tropical hydroclimate. Recently, theoretical considerations relating the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) position to the demands of global energy balance have emerged in the literature, allowing for a connection to be made between the paleoclimate simulations and recent developments in the understanding of ITCZ dynamics. These energetic considerations aid in explaining the well-known historical, paleoclimatic, and modeling evidence that the ITCZ migrates away from the hemisphere that is energetically deficient in response to asymmetric forcing.

Here we use two separate general circulation model (GCM) suites of experiments for the last millennium to relate the ITCZ position to asymmetries in prescribed volcanic sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere and related asymmetric radiative forcing. We discuss the ITCZ shift in the context of atmospheric energetics and discuss the ramifications of transient ITCZ migrations for other sensitive indicators of changes in the tropical hydrologic cycle, including global streamflow. For the first time, we also offer insight into the large-scale fingerprint of water isotopologues in precipitation (18Op) in response to asymmetries in radiative forcing.

The ITCZ shifts away from the hemisphere with greater volcanic forcing. Since the isotopic composition of precipitation in the ITCZ is relatively depleted compared to areas outside this zone, this meridional precipitation migration results in a large-scale enrichment (depletion) in the isotopic composition of tropical precipitation in regions the ITCZ moves away from (toward). Our results highlight the need for careful consideration of the spatial structure of volcanic forcing for interpreting volcanic signals in proxy records and therefore in evaluating the skill of Common Era climate model output. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Climate change may soon threaten much of global biodiversity, especially if species cannot adapt to changing climatic conditions quickly enough. A critical question is how quickly climatic niches change, and if this speed is sufficient to prevent extinction as climates warm. Here, we address this question in the grass family (Poaceae). Grasses are fundamental to one of Earth's most widespread biomes (grasslands), and provide roughly half of all calories consumed by humans (including wheat, rice, corn and sorghum). We estimate rates of climatic niche change in 236 species and compare these with rates of projected climate change by 2070. Our results show that projected climate change is consistently faster than rates of niche change in grasses, typically by more than 5000-fold for temperature-related variables. Although these results do not show directly what will happen under global warming, they have troubling implications for a major biome and for human food resources. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

The 2012 drought was the most severe and extensive summertime US drought in half a century with substantial economic loss and impacts on food security and commodity prices. A unique aspect of the 2012 drought was its rapid onset and intensification over the Southern Rockies, extending to the Great Plains during late spring and early summer, and the absence of known precursor large-scale patterns. Drought prediction therefore remains a major challenge. This study evaluates relationships among snow, soil moisture, and precipitation to identify sources of potential predictability of the 2012 summer drought using observations and a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model multi-physics ensemble experiment. Although underestimated in intensity, the drought signal is robust to the way atmospheric physical processes are represented in the model. For the Southern Rockies, soil moisture exhibits stronger persistence than precipitation in observations and the ensemble experiment. Correlations between winter/spring snowmelt and concurrent and following season soil moisture, and between soil moisture and concurrent and following season precipitation, in both observations and the model ensemble, suggest potential predictability beyond 1 and 2-month lead-time reside in the land surface conditions for apparent flash droughts such as the 2012 drought. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While they may have advanced in some areas^[1](https://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/hurricane-intensity-forecast-models-are-improving) , I don't believe advances in modelling are typically *that* significant when it comes to improving forecast lead times, depending on how you define significant. If I recall correctly, it averages out to about ~1 day per decade, give or take. As computing power advances the models have also become more complex. While I think the scientific community may find such advances to be significant I feel opinions most likely diverge between the general public and the scientific community on how applicable such advances are, and thus how significant they are.

___

**Abstract**:

Every human suffers through life a number of papillomaviruses (PVs) infections, most of them asymptomatic. A notable exception are persistent infections by Human Papillomavirus 16 (HPV16), the most oncogenic infectious agent for humans and responsible for most infection-driven anogenital cancers. Oncogenic potential is not homogeneous among HPV16 lineages, and genetic variation within HPV16 exhibits some geographic structure. However, an in-depth analysis of the HPV16 evolutionary history is still wanting.

We have analysed extant HPV16 diversity and compared the evolutionary and phylogeographical patterns of humans and of HPV16. We show that codivergence with modern humans explains at most 30% of the present viral geographical distribution. The most explanatory scenario suggests that ancestral HPV16 already infected ancestral human populations, and that viral lineages co-diverged with the hosts in parallel with the split between archaic Neanderthal-Denisovans and ancestral modern human populations, generating the ancestral HPV16A and HPV16BCD viral lineages, respectively.

We propose that after out-of-Africa migration of modern human ancestors, sexual transmission between human populations introduced HPV16A into modern human ancestor populations. We hypothesise that differential coevolution of HPV16 lineages with different but closely related ancestral human populations and subsequent host-switch events in parallel with introgression of archaic alleles into the genomes of modern human ancestors may be largely responsible for the present-day differential prevalence and association with cancers for HPV16 variants.  </TEXT>

While CH4 is released from seeps at depth from the sediments, the CH4 does not enter into the atmosphere. The reason? 

...stratification of the water column whereby layers of different density form, much like oil over water. This means there is no or low exchange of water masses between the surface layer and the layers below. A natural barrier occurs, acting as a ceiling, preventing the methane from reaching the surface. - [Eureka Alert](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-05/c-cf-aom052716.php) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Skilful predictions of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation one year ahead](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/ngeo2824.pdf)
___

**Abstract**:

The winter North Atlantic Oscillation is the primary mode of atmospheric variability in the North Atlantic region and has a profound influence on European and North American winter climate. Until recently, seasonal variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation was thought to be largely driven by chaotic and inherently unpredictable processes. However, latest generation seasonal forecasting systems have demonstrated significant skill in predicting the North Atlantic Oscillation when initialized a month before the onset of winter. Here we extend skilful dynamical model predictions to more than a year ahead. The skill increases greatly with ensemble size due to a spuriously small signal-to-noise ratio in the model, and consequently larger ensembles are projected to further increase the skill in predicting the North Atlantic Oscillation. We identify two sources of skill for second-winter forecasts of the North Atlantic Oscillation: climate variability in the tropical Pacific region and predictable effects of solar forcing on the stratospheric polar vortex strength. We also identify model biases in Arctic sea ice that, if reduced, may further increase skill. Our results open possibilities for a range of new climate services, including for the transport, energy, water management and insurance sectors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I was required to code simple climate models for a number of my courses in my degree, I have little experience with the computer science field itself so hopefully a) other persons with relevant backgrounds can point you in the right direction and b) it's likely worth your while to visit and inquire with other subreddits if you haven't already. That being said an older paper, "[Climate Change: A Grand Software Challenge](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/papers/2010/Easterbrook-FSE2010-wkshp.pdf)," (pdf) concluded the following areas were key areas to focus on:

 software to support the science of understanding climate change; software to support the global collective decision making; and software to reduce the carbon footprint of modern technology.

Hopefully that might help you develop some ideas of your own with regard to which direction you'd like to head in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This particular paper, with obvious implications towards climate contrarian (so called 'skeptics') arguments and therefore public outreach, is essentially a review of satellite adjustments and the accuracy of model ensembles. Satellite data is continually adjusted, for example note the adjustments listed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAH_satellite_temperature_dataset#Corrections_made), and a new study published this year ([here](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0744.1)).  

It's published because it needs to be; if you know something - publish it (it's really that simple). As more and more adjustments are made there is a requirement to asses the quality of those adjustments, which is what this particular paper has done. Obviously then with more adjustments to be made in the future we should expect another paper similar to this one that assesses the quality / reliability of said future adjustments.

Science is also about repeatability, if the results are not repeatable then there's something wrong with the study, and the results should be taken with a good degree of skepticism. The best way to ensure that the science is robust then is to conduct several studies over time, each inquiring about the same question, yet each study using a slightly different methodology. The hope is that each study will be in good agreement with one another. In the end then I hope you see that it has nothing to do with pushing a narrative, but everything to do with developing robust scientific conclusions. </TEXT>

I felt it important to incorporate that into the title because it's important to note that while any single model (see [CMIP5 model list](https://i.imgur.com/AGBMliM.jpg) used in IPCC AR5 for example^[1](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter09_FINAL.pdf) ) has its strengths and weaknesses it's the average of the ensemble that is important as is shown from [Figure 1](https://i.imgur.com/Z36zfwl.jpg) of this study. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Typically the further you go back in time the lower the resolution becomes; however, we're talking tens to hundreds of millions of years. Climate data millions of years ago can have a surprisingly high resolution if sufficiently preserved. [18O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9418O) records (amongst a multitude of other isotopic methods) can yield seasonal variations in speleothems, as can varves - producing records of summer winter couplets, etc. Combining different paleoclimate proxies (such as 18O and [TEX86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TEX86) for example) can further reduce uncertainty to assist in paleoclimate reconstruction efforts (see: [marine isotope stages](http://www.geo.arizona.edu/palynology/geos462/QuaTimeMIS.jpg) - the x-axis is in thousands of years)

Newer analytical methods are constantly being developed and are capable of reproducing even higher resolution data sets. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be honest, not really. These issues are already known - hence the adjustments to data sets as in this article, while other climate contrarian claims are often rehashes of already debunked arguments - much like arguments put forth by flat Earthers, Young Earth Creationists, etc. 

Contrarian claims are often made well after the fact and call into question methods that they have little understanding of. For example, they see adjustments made to satellite data and 'cry foul,' meanwhile these adjustments were made because the science community already knew about the problem and made the necessary adjustments to correct for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because they have to in order to be precise. The article itself does a good job of stating why corrections are made to satellite data. 

1) Satellites drift (their orbits decay with time). This means that over time your data will shift. For example, let's sat that I'm orbiting the Earth and I want to measure the temperature of the middle troposphere (TMT) (think y-axis) at a specific location (think x-axis) which occurs at 4:00pm (a relatively warm period of the day). As my orbit slowly decays over time the location that I'm measuring at 4:00pm will no longer be the same location as it was previously and I may no longer be measuring the temperature at the mid. troposphere. In other words I would see a shift in my data for that location and temperatures would appear to be changing. That is to say that my y and x axis have shifted - therefore I have to correct for this. This is simplified but it should serve to highlight one of the reasons satellite data must be corrected for in order to be useful.

2) Not every satellite that gets placed into orbit is the same. Improved technology or different sensors will have different margins and sources of error. In order to splice one data set from one satellite (apple) to the data set of another satellite (orange) corrections must therefore be made to the satellite data in order to account for differences between the two sets (now apples to apples).

Of course there are more kinds of corrections (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAH_satellite_temperature_dataset ) but the point I'm making is that data sets *must* be adjusted and there are many methods by which to do this depending on the type of data (for example: [homogenization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogenization_(climate)). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for sharing. I was hoping they might discuss other interpretations of the data showing a decrease in CO2 uptake. For example, the Mauna Loa Observatory is, for all intents and purposes of this study, a single data point that is assumed to be representative of the entire northern hemisphere. Provided its location, could this be a result of seasonally varying atmospheric circulation between Eurasian and North American airmasses rather than a decline in CO2 uptake? If so, it seems that the underlying assumption that the Mauna Loa Observatory is representative of the northern hemisphere in relation to CO2 uptake by biomass cannot be reasonably justified. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Comparing tropospheric warming in climate models and satellite data](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0333.1)
___

**Abstract**:

We use updated and improved satellite retrievals of the temperature of the mid- to upper troposphere (TMT) to address key questions about the size and significance of TMT trends, agreement with model-derived TMT values, and whether models and satellite data show similar vertical profiles of warming. A recent study claimed that TMT trends over 1979 and 2015 are three times larger in climate models than in satellite data, but did not correct for the contribution TMT trends receive from stratospheric cooling. Here we show that the average ratio of modeled and observed TMT trends is sensitive to both satellite data uncertainties and to model-data differences in stratospheric cooling. When the impact of lower stratospheric cooling on TMT is accounted for, and when the most recent versions of satellite datasets are used, the previously claimed ratio of three between simulated and observed near-global TMT trends is reduced to  1.7. Next, we assess the validity of the statement that satellite data show no significant tropospheric warming over the last 18 years. This claim is not supported by our analysis: in five out of six corrected satellite TMT records, significant global-scale tropospheric warming has occurred within the last 18 years. Finally, we address long-standing concerns regarding discrepancies in modeled and observed vertical profiles of warming in the tropical atmosphere. We show that amplification of tropical warming between the lower and mid- to upper troposphere is now in close agreement in the average of 37 climate models and in one updated satellite record. </TEXT>

**Abstract**:

The declining ability of the Northern Hemisphere biosphere to sequester carbon from the atmosphere is shown to be having an impact on the current rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations equivalent to adding the annual man-made emissions from China. If this trend continues, then global emissions will have to decline even faster than previously thought.

___

**Abstract**:

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from residential wood and crop residue burning were measured in Colorado, U.S. When compared to the emissions from crop burning, residential wood burning exhibited markedly lower concentrations of acetonitrile, a commonly used biomass burning tracer. For both herbaceous and arboraceous fuels, the emissions of nitrogen-containing VOCs (NVOCs) strongly depend on the fuel nitrogen content; therefore, low NVOC emissions from residential wood burning result from the combustion of low-nitrogen fuel. Consequently, the emissions of compounds hazardous to human health, such as HNCO and HCN, and the formation of secondary pollutants, such as ozone generated by NOx, are likely to depend on fuel nitrogen. These results also demonstrate that acetonitrile may not be a suitable tracer for domestic burning in urban areas. Wood burning emissions may be best identified through analysis of the emissions profile rather than reliance on a single tracer species. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Natural carbon sinks currently absorb approximately half of the anthropogenic CO2 emitted by fossil fuel burning, cement production and land-use change. However, this airborne fraction may change in the future depending on the emissions scenario. An important issue in developing carbon budgets to achieve climate stabilisation targets is the behaviour of natural carbon sinks, particularly under low emissions mitigation scenarios as required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. A key requirement for low carbon pathways is to quantify the effectiveness of negative emissions technologies which will be strongly affected by carbon cycle feedbacks. Here we find that Earth system models suggest significant weakening, even potential reversal, of the ocean and land sinks under future low emission scenarios. For the RCP2.6 concentration pathway, models project land and ocean sinks to weaken to 0.8  0.9 and 1.1  0.3 GtC yr^1 respectively for the second half of the 21st century and to 0.4  0.4 and 0.1  0.2 GtC yr^1 respectively for the second half of the 23rd century. Weakening of natural carbon sinks will hinder the effectiveness of negative emissions technologies and therefore increase their required deployment to achieve a given climate stabilisation target. We introduce a new metric, the perturbation airborne fraction, to measure and assess the effectiveness of negative emissions. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Previous studies have revealed the excellence of the westernmost Mediterranean records for reconstructing climate conditions over the last two millennia. In particular, inorganic and organic proxies have revealed a coherent signal of climate and oceanographic responses during this time. Here we compare and integrate both proxy records for reconstructing climate and oceanographic conditions with focus on the last millennium. The higher temperatures indicated by lipid-based proxies during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) are coincident with drier conditions indicated by inorganic proxies. In contrast, lower temperatures and humid conditions are indicated during the Little Ice Age (LIA). The industrial period was characterized by increasing humidity in comparison with the previous LIA. However, a progressive aridification occurred since the second half of the twentieth century, coexisting with a warming trend and higher contribution of C3 grasses. Proxy records are also interpreted to show Atlantic water inflow at AD 1450 and 1950 and an intensification of the upwelling conditions coinciding with a prolonged positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phase in the intervals AD 10001450 and 19601990. Large-scale oceanicatmospheric circulation patterns (the NAO and the Atlantic meridional circulation) and solar irradiance variations seem to have played the major key role during the last millennium, together with anthropogenic contributions in the more recent record. </TEXT>

<TEXT> About a year go now the Zwally et al. (NASA) paper came out. Polar ice refers to ice within the polar regions, both in the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere. There is no question regarding the decline of the Greenland Ice Sheet, glaciers, or Arctic Sea Ice. When it comes to the southern hemisphere, glacial mass is in decline, as is the Antarctic Ice Sheet (land ice); however, Antarctic Sea Ice has shown limited growth.

The picture gets somewhat complicated because some regions of Antarctica are gaining mass while others are losing mass. In general, the ice shelves and outlet glaciers in western Antarctica are losing mass while those in eastern Antarctica have been gaining   losing mass (see [map](https://i.imgur.com/hQEU9kS.jpg))^[1](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6232/327).

When it comes to the interior of Antarctica; however, the NASA study (Zwally et al.) argued for an increase in ice mass within the western interior of Antarctica which is at odds with a plethora of other studies that find the opposite trend (see [figure](http://www.realclimate.org/images//Antarctic_MassBalance_.png)).

While the data Zwally used only extended to 2008 he did have the following to say: 

Were essentially in agreement with other studies that show an increase in ice discharge in the Antarctic Peninsula and the Thwaites and Pine Island region of West Antarctica, said Jay Zwally... Our main disagreement is for East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica  there, we see an ice gain that exceeds the losses in the other areas.

The Zwally et al. study is [heavily disputed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/11/05/a-controversial-nasa-study-says-antarctica-is-gaining-ice-heres-why-you-should-stay-skeptical/?utm_term=.acf49c62d653) and one should always be skeptical of a single study that contradicts countless others. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Abrupt plant physiological changes in southern New Zealand at the termination of the Mi-1 event reflect shifts in hydroclimate and pCO2](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X16305064)
___

**Abstract**:

A rise in atmospheric CO2 is believed to be necessary for the termination of large-scale glaciations. Although the Antarctic Ice Sheet is estimated to have melted from 125% to 50% its modern size, there is thus far no evidence for an increase in atmospheric CO2 associated with the Mi-1 glacial termination in the earliest Miocene. Here, we present evidence from a high-resolution terrestrial record of leaf physiological change in southern New Zealand for an abrupt increase in atmospheric CO2 coincident with the termination of the Mi-1 glaciation and lasting approximately 20 kyr. Quantitative pCO2 estimates, made using a leaf gas exchange model, suggest that atmospheric CO2 levels may have doubled during this period, from 516111ppm to 1144410ppm, and subsequently returned back to 42553ppm. The 20-kyr interval with high pCO2 estimates is also associated with a period of increased moisture supply to southern New Zealand, inferred from carbon and hydrogen isotopes of terrestrial leaf waxes. The results provide the first high-resolution record of terrestrial environmental change at the Oligocene/Miocene boundary, document a 20 kyr interval of elevated pCO2 and increased local moisture availability, and provide insight into ecosystem response to a major orbitally driven climatic transition. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Cosmic radiation exposure and persistent cognitive dysfunction](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep34774)
___

**Abstract**:

The Mars mission will result in an inevitable exposure to cosmic radiation that has been shown to cause cognitive impairments in rodent models, and possibly in astronauts engaged in deep space travel. Of particular concern is the potential for cosmic radiation exposure to compromise critical decision making during normal operations or under emergency conditions in deep space. Rodents exposed to cosmic radiation exhibit persistent hippocampal and cortical based performance decrements using six independent behavioral tasks administered between separate cohorts 12 and 24 weeks after irradiation. Radiation-induced impairments in spatial, episodic and recognition memory were temporally coincident with deficits in executive function and reduced rates of fear extinction and elevated anxiety. Irradiation caused significant reductions in dendritic complexity, spine density and altered spine morphology along medial prefrontal cortical neurons known to mediate neurotransmission interrogated by our behavioral tasks. Cosmic radiation also disrupted synaptic integrity and increased neuroinflammation that persisted more than 6 months after exposure. Behavioral deficits for individual animals correlated significantly with reduced spine density and increased synaptic puncta, providing quantitative measures of risk for developing cognitive impairment. Our data provide additional evidence that deep space travel poses a real and unique threat to the integrity of neural circuits in the brain. </TEXT>

___

**Significance**:

This study demonstrates quantitatively that the frequency of Hurricane Sandy-like extreme flood events has increased significantly over the past two centuries and is very likely to increase more sharply over the 21st century, due to the compound effects of sea level rise and storm climatology change.

**Abstract**:

Coastal flood hazard varies in response to changes in storm surge climatology and the sea level. Here we combine probabilistic projections of the sea level and storm surge climatology to estimate the temporal evolution of flood hazard. We find that New York Citys flood hazard has increased significantly over the past two centuries and is very likely to increase more sharply over the 21st century. Due to the effect of sea level rise, the return period of Hurricane Sandys flood height decreased by a factor of 3 from year 1800 to 2000 and is estimated to decrease by a further 4.4 from 2000 to 2100 under a moderate-emissions pathway. When potential storm climatology change over the 21st century is also accounted for, Sandys return period is estimated to decrease by 3 to 17 from 2000 to 2100. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Impact of anthropogenic climate change on wildfire across western US forests](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/10/05/1607171113.abstract)
___


**Significance**:

Increased forest fire activity across the western United States in recent decades has contributed to widespread forest mortality, carbon emissions, periods of degraded air quality, and substantial fire suppression expenditures. Although numerous factors aided the recent rise in fire activity, observed warming and drying have significantly increased fire-season fuel aridity, fostering a more favorable fire environment across forested systems. We demonstrate that human-caused climate change caused over half of the documented increases in fuel aridity since the 1970s and doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984. This analysis suggests that anthropogenic climate change will continue to chronically enhance the potential for western US forest fire activity while fuels are not limiting.

**Abstract**:

Increased forest fire activity across the western continental United States (US) in recent decades has likely been enabled by a number of factors, including the legacy of fire suppression and human settlement, natural climate variability, and human-caused climate change. We use modeled climate projections to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to observed increases in eight fuel aridity metrics and forest fire area across the western United States. Anthropogenic increases in temperature and vapor pressure deficit significantly enhanced fuel aridity across western US forests over the past several decades and, during 20002015, contributed to 75% more forested area experiencing high (1 ) fire-season fuel aridity and an average of nine additional days per year of high fire potential. Anthropogenic climate change accounted for 55% of observed increases in fuel aridity from 1979 to 2015 across western US forests, highlighting both anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability as important contributors to increased wildfire potential in recent decades. We estimate that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional 4.2 million ha of forest fire area during 19842015, nearly doubling the forest fire area expected in its absence. Natural climate variability will continue to alternate between modulating and compounding anthropogenic increases in fuel aridity, but anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a driver of increased forest fire activity and should continue to do so while fuels are not limiting.

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Hadley circulation and precipitation changes controling black shale deposition in the Late Jurassic Boreal Seaway](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015PA002911/full)
___

**Abstract**

New climate simulations using the HadCM3L model with a paleogeography of the Late Jurassic (155.5Ma) and proxy-data corroborate that warm and wet tropical-like conditions reached as far north as the UK sector of the Jurassic Boreal Seaway (~35N). This is associated with a northern hemisphere Jurassic Hadley cell and an intensified subtropical jet which both extend significantly poleward than in the modern (JulySeptember). Deposition of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation (KCF) occurred in the shallow, storm-dominated, epeiric Boreal Seaway. High-resolution paleo-environmental proxy data from the Kimmeridge Clay Formation (KCF; ~155150Ma), UK, are used to test for the role of tropical atmospheric circulation on meter-scale heterogeneities in black shale deposition. Proxy and model data show that the most organic-rich section (eudoxus to mid-hudlestoni zones) is characterized by a positive 13Corg excursion and up to 37wt % total organic carbon (%TOC). Orbital modulation of organic carbon burial primarily in the long eccentricity power band combined with a clear positive correlation between %TOC carbonate-free and the kaolinite/illite ratio supports peak organic carbon burial under the influence of very humid climate conditions, similar to the modern tropics. This reinterpretation of large-scale climate relationships, supported by independent modeling and geological data, has profound implications for atmospheric circulation patterns and processes affecting marine productivity and organic carbon burial further north along the Boreal Seaway, including the Arctic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Climate change is advancing spring onset across the U.S. 
national park system](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.1465/full)
___

**Abstract**

Many U.S. national parks are already at the extreme warm end of their historical temperature distributions. With rapidly warming conditions, park resource management will be enhanced by information on seasonality of climate that supports adjustments in the timing of activities such as treating invasive species, operating visitor facilities, and scheduling climate-related events (e.g., flower festivals and fall leaf-viewing). Seasonal changes in vegetation, such as pollen, seed, and fruit production, are important drivers of ecological processes in parks, and phenology has thus been identified as a key indicator for park monitoring. Phenology is also one of the most proximate biological responses to climate change. Here, we use estimates of start of spring based on climatically modeled dates of first leaf and first bloom derived from indicator plant species to evaluate the recent timing of spring onset (past 1030 yr) in each U.S. natural resource park relative to its historical range of variability across the past 112 yr (19012012). Of the 276 high latitude to subtropical parks examined, spring is advancing in approximately three-quarters of parks (76%), and 53% of parks are experiencing extreme early springs that exceed 95% of historical conditions. Our results demonstrate how changes in climate seasonality are important for understanding ecological responses to climate change, and further how spatial variability in effects of climate change necessitates different approaches to management. We discuss how our results inform climate change adaptation challenges and opportunities facing parks, with implications for other protected areas, by exploring consequences for resource management and planning. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Laboratory demonstration of slow rise to fast acceleration of arched magnetic flux ropes](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL069744/abstract)
___

**Abstract**:

We demonstrate the slow rise to fast acceleration of an arched plasma-filled magnetic flux rope. The flux rope expansion is inhibited by an externally applied customizable strapping field. When the strapping field is not too strong and not too weak, expansion forces build up while the flux rope is in the strapping field region. When the flux rope moves to a critical height beyond the peak strapping field region, the plasma accelerates quickly corresponding to the observed slow rise to fast acceleration of solar eruptions. This behavior is in agreement with the predictions of the torus instability. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That article is crap, and is easily debunked on many fronts (far too many for me to invest in time wise). Essentially, however, it relates to [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_sensitivity) values which are commonly reported to be likely from 1.5C to 4.5C for a doubling of CO2, with general agreement on the most likely value being 3C.

For starters, I would recommend the following by [Dr. Andrew Dessler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Dessler)

<TEXT> Smh. Who links directly to pay-walled studies?

As I stated previously, there are flashy headlines (yours) and then there are descriptive headlines that describe the findings of the study (mine). Because there are often minor discrepancies between media articles and the actual study it is always important to refer to the abstract, if not the full study when available. This is why I post a direct link to the study itself as well as the abstract in every /r/science submission I make.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Excellent summary of the literature (I tend to favor the fossil fuel camp). It should be noted that there are other important implications other than just attribution however. For example, if these newer estimates are correct then our carbon budget for limiting warming below 2C is further reduced.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To each their own I suppose as I disagree with your choice. It doesn't provide the important information of what the potential source of methane is (natural geological seeps, fossil fuels industry, agriculture, etc) and sounds potentially misleading in that it doesn't state that emissions are not increasing but rather just that they are much greater than previously estimated. These are important pieces of information that tell the reader what's going on rather than just getting their attention. There are flashy headlines (yours) and then there are descriptive headlines that describe the findings of the study (mine). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Upward revision of global fossil fuel methane emissions based on isotope database](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v538/n7623/full/nature19797.html)
___

**Abstract**

Methane has the second-largest global radiative forcing impact of anthropogenic greenhouse gases after carbon dioxide, but our understanding of the global atmospheric methane budget is incomplete. The global fossil fuel industry (production and usage of natural gas, oil and coal) is thought to contribute 15 to 22 per cent of methane emissions to the total atmospheric methane budget. However, questions remain regarding methane emission trends as a result of fossil fuel industrial activity and the contribution to total methane emissions of sources from the fossil fuel industry and from natural geological seepage, which are often co-located. Here we re-evaluate the global methane budget and the contribution of the fossil fuel industry to methane emissions based on long-term global methane and methane carbon isotope records. We compile the largest isotopic methane source signature database so far, including fossil fuel, microbial and biomass-burning methane emission sources. We find that total fossil fuel methane emissions (fossil fuel industry plus natural geological seepage) are not increasing over time, but are 60 to 110 per cent greater than current estimates owing to large revisions in isotope source signatures. We show that this is consistent with the observed global latitudinal methane gradient. After accounting for natural geological methane seepage, we find that methane emissions from natural gas, oil and coal production and their usage are 20 to 60 per cent greater than inventories. Our findings imply a greater potential for the fossil fuel industry to mitigate anthropogenic climate forcing, but we also find that methane emissions from natural gas as a fraction of production have declined from approximately 8 per cent to approximately 2 per cent over the past three decades. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Evidence for a limit to human lifespan](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature19793.html)
___

**Abstract**:

Driven by technological progress, human life expectancy has increased greatly since the nineteenth century. Demographic evidence has revealed an ongoing reduction in old-age mortality and a rise of the maximum age at death, which may gradually extend human longevity. Together with observations that lifespan in various animal species is flexible and can be increased by genetic or pharmaceutical intervention, these results have led to suggestions that longevity may not be subject to strict, species-specific genetic constraints. Here, by analysing global demographic data, we show that improvements in survival with age tend to decline after age 100, and that the age at death of the worlds oldest person has not increased since the 1990s. Our results strongly suggest that the maximum lifespan of humans is fixed and subject to natural constraints. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Variability of fire carbon emissions in Equatorial Asia and its non-linear sensitivity to El Nio](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL070971/full)
___

**Abstract**

The large peatland carbon stocks in the land use change-affected areas of Equatorial Asia are vulnerable to fire. Combining satellite observations of active fire, burned area, and atmospheric concentrations of combustion tracers with a Bayesian inversion, we estimated the amount and variability of fire carbon emissions in Equatorial Asia over the period 1997-2015. Emissions in 2015 were of 0.51  0.17 Pg carbon  less than half of the emissions from the previous 1997 extreme El Nio, explained by a less acute water deficit. Fire severity could be empirically hindcasted from the cumulative water deficit with a lead time of 1 to 2 months. Based on future climate projections and an exponential empirical relationship found between fire carbon emissions and water deficit, we infer a total fire carbon loss ranging from 12 to 25 Pg by 2100 in the coming decades, a significant positive feedback to future climate warming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Are long tide gauge records in the wrong place to measure global mean sea level rise?](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL070552/abstract)
___

**Abstract**:

Ocean dynamics, land motion, and changes in Earths gravitational and rotational fields cause local sea level change to deviate from the rate of global mean sea level rise. Here, we use observations and simulations of spatial structure in sea level change to estimate the likelihood that these processes cause sea level trends in the longest and highest-quality tide gauge records to be systematically biased relative to the true global mean rate. The analyzed records have an average 20th century rate of approximately 1.6 mm/yr, but based on the locations of these gauges, we show the simple average underestimates the 20th century global mean rate by 0.1     0.2 mm/yr. Given the distribution of potential sampling biases, we find   1% probability that observed trends from the longest and highest-quality TG records are consistent with global mean rates less than 1.4 mm/yr. </TEXT>

___


**Abstract**:

Enceladus' gravity and shape have been explained in terms of a thick isostatic ice shell floating on a global ocean, in contradiction of the thin shell implied by librations. Here we propose a new isostatic model minimizing crustal deviatoric stress, and demonstrate that gravity and shape data predict a 38  4km-thick ocean beneath a 23  4km-thick shell agreeing with  but independent from  libration data. Isostatic and tidal stresses are comparable in magnitude. South polar crust is only 7  4km thick, facilitating the opening of water conduits and enhancing tidal dissipation through stress concentration. Enceladus' resonant companion, Dione, is in a similar state of minimum stress isostasy. Its gravity and shape can be explained in terms of a 99  23km-thick isostatic shell overlying a 65  30km-thick global ocean, thus providing the first clear evidence for a present-day ocean within Dione. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

We find that summer methane (CH4) release from seabed sediments west of Svalbard substantially increases CH4 concentrations in the ocean but has limited influence on the atmospheric CH4 levels. Our conclusion stems from complementary measurements at the seafloor, in the ocean, and in the atmosphere from land-based, ship and aircraft platforms during a summer campaign in 2014. We detected high concentrations of dissolved CH4 in the ocean above the seafloor with a sharp decrease above the pycnocline. Model approaches taking potential CH4 emissions from both dissolved and bubble-released CH4 from a larger region into account reveal a maximum flux compatible with the observed atmospheric CH4 mixing ratios of 2.43.8nmolm^2 s^1. This is too low to have an impact on the atmospheric summer CH4 budget in the year 2014. Long-term ocean observatories may shed light on the complex variations of Arctic CH4 cycles throughout the year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This particular study (feel free to read it at length, it's open access) states:

The range of plastic microfibres found ingested/internalised by organisms studied here included modified acrylic, polypropylene, viscose, polyester, and acrylic. Polypropylene has been found to adsorb PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), nonylphenol and DDE, an organochlorine pesticide. Polyethylene, a type of polyolefin fibre whose chemical composition in part is the basis of some polyester fibres (e.g. polyethylene terephthalate), has been found to adsorb four times more PCBs than polypropylene. Polypropylene has also been found to adsorb a range of metals in a marine environment; the concentrations of most of these metals did not saturate over a year period suggesting plastics in the oceans for long time periods accumulate greater concentrations of metals.

Chemical contamination experiments are rare in the marine environment, and often present unrealistic experimental scenarios. Yet with the chemical ingredients in 50% of plastics listed as hazardous (United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals) such issues maybe just the start of long-term ecological and health problems associated with waste plastics in the environment; impacts that have not been looked at in many marine animals and no deep-sea animals as yet.

Other studies, looking at zooplankton and microplastics^[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00244-015-0172-5), ^[2](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es400663f) have shown a number of similar concerns speculating that they could block the guts or marine organisms, leach into their bodies, deteriorate the overall health of the marine organism, effects on reproduction, and accumulate as they are transferred to higher trophic levels (salmon, whales, etc).

Which reminds me of an older Bill Burr joke:

All the fads, you remember rollerblading? Remember that? Everybody had them. We set up cones; we did little tricks, right? One little homophobic joke killed that entire fad. Whats the hardest part about rollerblading? Telling your parents youre gay. Full grown adults, dude, Im not gay. I dont have the cooties. These things mean I suck dick. And they just threw them out. They end up in the ocean. Theyre made of plastic, they dont biodegrade. They just break down into little cubes. Fish will breath them in. Six months later, youre going out, youre getting sushi. You think youre being healthy. Youre eating your old roller-blades. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

All of the cations currently used in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) abide by the tolerance factor for incorporation into the lattice. We show that the small and oxidation-stable Rb+ can be embedded into a cation cascade to create perovskite materials with excellent material properties. We achieved stabilized efficiencies of up to 21.6% (average value: 20.2%) on small areas (and a stabilized 19.0% on a 0.5 cm^2 cell) as well as an electroluminescence of 3.8%. The open-circuit voltage of 1.24 volts at a band gap of 1.63 electron volts leads to loss-in-potential of 0.39 V, versus 0.4 V for commercial silicon cells. Polymer-coated cells maintained 95% of their initial performance at 85C for 500 hours under full solar illumination and maximum power point tracking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Plio-Pleistocene climate sensitivity evaluated using high-resolution CO2 records](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7537/abs/nature14145.html)
___

**Abstract**:

Theory and climate modelling suggest that the sensitivity of Earths climate to changes in radiative forcing could depend on the background climate. However, palaeoclimate data have thus far been insufficient to provide a conclusive test of this prediction. Here we present atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) reconstructions based on multi-site boron-isotope records from the late Pliocene epoch (3.3 to 2.3 million years ago). We find that Earths climate sensitivity to CO2-based radiative forcing (Earth system sensitivity) was half as strong during the warm Pliocene as during the cold late Pleistocene epoch (0.8 to 0.01 million years ago). We attribute this difference to the radiative impacts of continental ice-volume changes (the icealbedo feedback) during the late Pleistocene, because equilibrium climate sensitivity is identical for the two intervals when we account for such impacts using sea-level reconstructions. We conclude that, on a global scale, no unexpected climate feedbacks operated during the warm Pliocene, and that predictions of equilibrium climate sensitivity (excluding long-term ice-albedo feedbacks) for our Pliocene-like future (with CO2 levels up to maximum Pliocene levels of 450 parts per million) are well described by the currently accepted range of an increase of 1.5 K to 4.5 K per doubling of CO2.

<TEXT> Study: [Unexpected rewards induce dopamine-dependent positive emotionlike state changes in bumblebees](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6307/1529)
___

**Abstract**:

Whether invertebrates exhibit positive emotionlike states and what mechanisms underlie such states remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that bumblebees exhibit dopamine-dependent positive emotionlike states across behavioral contexts. After training with one rewarding and one unrewarding cue, bees that received pretest sucrose responded in a positive manner toward ambiguous cues. In a second experiment, pretest consumption of sucrose solution resulted in a shorter time to reinitiate foraging after a simulated predator attack. These behavioral changes were abolished with topical application of the dopamine antagonist fluphenazine. Further experiments established that pretest sucrose does not simply cause bees to become more exploratory. Our findings present a new opportunity for understanding the fundamental neural elements of emotions and may alter the view of how emotion states affect decision-making in animals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's definitely an interesting question, with plenty of factors to consider (what is the source of energy production, improved efficiency in electronics, etc.), however, it could rightly be considered a single component of what has been studied under the umbrella term, the '[urban heat island effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pidRKmq2iGI).' The IPCC has the following to say: 

Clearly, the urban heat island effect is a real climate change in urban areas, but is not representative of larger areas. Extensive tests have shown that the urban heat island effects are no more than about 0.05C up to 1990 in the global temperature records used in this chapter to depict climate change. Thus we have assumed an uncertainty of zero in global land-surface air temperature in 1900 due to urbanisation, linearly increasing to 0.06C (two standard deviations 0.12C) in 2000.^[1](https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/052.htm)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Projected land photosynthesis constrained by changes in the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature19772.html)
___

**Abstract**:

Uncertainties in the response of vegetation to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations contribute to the large spread in projections of future climate change. Climatecarbon cycle models generally agree that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations will enhance terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). However, the magnitude of this CO2 fertilization effect varies from a 20 per cent to a 60 per cent increase in GPP for a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations in model studies. Here we demonstrate emergent constraints on large-scale CO2 fertilization using observed changes in the amplitude of the atmospheric CO2 seasonal cycle that are thought to be the result of increasing terrestrial GPP. Our comparison of atmospheric CO2 measurements from Point Barrow in Alaska and Cape Kumukahi in Hawaii with historical simulations of the latest climatecarbon cycle models demonstrates that the increase in the amplitude of the CO2 seasonal cycle at both measurement sites is consistent with increasing annual mean GPP, driven in part by climate warming, but with differences in CO2 fertilization controlling the spread among the model trends. As a result, the relationship between the amplitude of the CO2 seasonal cycle and the magnitude of CO2 fertilization of GPP is almost linear across the entire ensemble of models. When combined with the observed trends in the seasonal CO2 amplitude, these relationships lead to consistent emergent constraints on the CO2 fertilization of GPP. Overall, we estimate a GPP increase of 37  9 per cent for high-latitude ecosystems and 32  9 per cent for extratropical ecosystems under a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations on the basis of the Point Barrow and Cape Kumukahi records, respectively. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Personal Vehicles Evaluated against Climate Change Mitigation Targets](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.6b00177)
___

**Abstract**:

Meeting global climate change mitigation goals will likely require that transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions begin to decline within the next two decades and then continue to fall. A variety of vehicle technologies and fuels are commercially available to consumers today that can reduce the emissions of the transportation sector. Yet what are the best options, and do any suffice to meet climate policy targets? Here, we examine the costs and carbon intensities of 125 light-duty vehicle models on the U.S. market today and evaluate these models against U.S. emission-reduction targets for 2030, 2040, and 2050 that are compatible with the goal of limiting mean global temperature rise to 2 C above preindustrial levels. Our results show that consumers are not required to pay more for a low-carbon-emitting vehicle. Across the diverse set of vehicle models and powertrain technologies examined, a clean vehicle is usually a low-cost vehicle. Although the average carbon intensity of vehicles sold in 2014 exceeds the climate target for 2030 by more than 50%, we find that most hybrid and battery electric vehicles available today meet this target. By 2050, only electric vehicles supplied with almost completely carbon-free electric power are expected to meet climate-policy targets. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Current intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) are insufficient to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature change to between 1.5 and 2.0C above pre-industrial levels, so the effectiveness of existing INDCs will be crucial to further progress. Here we assess the likely range of US greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2025 and whether the USs INDC can be met, on the basis of updated historical and projected estimates. We group US INDC policies into three categories reflecting potential future policies, and model 17 policies across these categories. With all modelled policies included, the upper end of the uncertainty range overlaps with the 2025 INDC target, but the required reductions are not achieved using reference values. Even if all modelled policies are implemented, additional GHG reduction is probably required; we discuss several potential policies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Evolution of global temperature over the past two million years](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature19798.html)
___

**Abstract**:

Reconstructions of Earths past climate strongly influence our understanding of the dynamics and sensitivity of the climate system. Yet global temperature has been reconstructed for only a few isolated windows of time, and continuous reconstructions across glacial cycles remain elusive. Here I present a spatially weighted proxy reconstruction of global temperature over the past 2 million years estimated from a multi-proxy database of over 20,000 sea surface temperature point reconstructions. Global temperature gradually cooled until roughly 1.2 million years ago and cooling then stalled until the present. The cooling trend probably stalled before the beginning of the mid-Pleistocene transition, and pre-dated the increase in the maximum size of ice sheets around 0.9 million years ago. Thus, global cooling may have been a pre-condition for, but probably is not the sole causal mechanism of, the shift to quasi-100,000-year glacial cycles at the mid-Pleistocene transition. Over the past 800,000 years, polar amplification (the amplification of temperature change at the poles relative to global temperature change) has been stable over time, and global temperature and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations have been closely coupled across glacial cycles. A comparison of the new temperature reconstruction with radiative forcing from greenhouse gases estimates an Earth system sensitivity of 9 degrees Celsius (range 7 to 13 degrees Celsius, 95 per cent credible interval) change in global average surface temperature per doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide over millennium timescales. This result suggests that stabilization at todays greenhouse gas levels may already commit Earth to an eventual total warming of 5 degrees Celsius (range 3 to 7 degrees Celsius, 95 per cent credible interval) over the next few millennia as ice sheets, vegetation and atmospheric dust continue to respond to global warming.

<TEXT> I'll take a stab at it (anyone who knows, please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).

Ignoring a number of major specific details (such as Earth's secondary atmosphere, carbon cycle, etc.) let's look at only two. 

1) Venus has less gravity than Earth, 8.87ms^-2 and 9.81ms^-2 respectively (90.4% of Earth's gravity). This is important because this means that lighter gasses can escape more easily (due to a lower escape velocity - 10.36 kms^-1 compared to Earth's 11.186 kms^-1 ). 

2) Venus is located closer to the Sun, on average 108 million km away (.722 AU), with the Earth on average 152 million km away from the Sun (1.01 AU); a difference of 44 million km. This means the amount of energy reaching Venus from the Sun is greater (due to the inverse square law) than the amount of energy reaching Earth. 

Combing (1) and (2) we can see that any lighter elements would escape from Venus that may not escape from the Earth quite so easily. Any water vapor in its atmosphere would split apart into hydrogen, and oxygen. While the hydrogen could escape into space, the oxygen would recombine with carbon to form a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide. If you were to move Earth in the orbit of Venus today you could achieve a run away greenhouse effect. Interestingly this also presents us with one of the unsolved mysteries in Earth's geological past... 
The Sun wasn't always so luminous - so while Venus may have been habitable early on the Earth would have been too cold. This paradox is known as the 'faint young sun' paradox. 

Because the Earth is much, much cooler it can retain a number of molecules in liquid and solid form rather than gaseous. Should you increase the temperature and turn much of Earth's liquids and solids (water ice, clathrates, carbon in soils, etc.) to gaseous phases you could increase Earth's atmospheric pressure (ie. run away greenhouse effect).

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Geodetic measurements reveal similarities between postLast Glacial Maximum and present-day mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/9/e1600931.full)
___

**Abstract**:

Accurate quantification of the millennial-scale mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) and its contribution to global sea-level rise remain challenging because of sparse in situ observations in key regions. Glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) is the ongoing response of the solid Earth to ice and ocean load changes occurring since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; ~21 thousand years ago) and may be used to constrain the GrIS deglaciation history. We use data from the Greenland Global Positioning System network to directly measure GIA and estimate basin-wide mass changes since the LGM. Unpredicted, large GIA uplift rates of +12 mm/year are found in southeast Greenland. These rates are due to low upper mantle viscosity in the region, from when Greenland passed over the Iceland hot spot about 40 million years ago. This region of concentrated soft rheology has a profound influence on reconstructing the deglaciation history of Greenland. We reevaluate the evolution of the GrIS since LGM and obtain a loss of 1.5-m sea-level equivalent from the northwest and southeast. These same sectors are dominating modern mass loss. We suggest that the present destabilization of these marine-based sectors may increase sea level for centuries to come. Our new deglaciation history and GIA uplift estimates suggest that studies that use the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite mission to infer present-day changes in the GrIS may have erroneously corrected for GIA and underestimated the mass loss by about 20 gigatons/year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Report: [The Skys Limit: Why the Paris Climate Goals Require a Managed Decline of Fossil Fuel Production](http://priceofoil.org/2016/09/22/the-skys-limit-report/)
___

A new study released by Oil Change International, in partnership with 14 organizations from around the world, scientifically grounds the growing movement to keep carbon in the ground by revealing the need to stop all new fossil fuel infrastructure and industry expansion. It focuses on the potential carbon emissions from developed reserves  where the wells are already drilled, the pits dug, and the pipelines, processing facilities, railways, and export terminals constructed.

**Key Findings**:

- The potential carbon emissions from the oil, gas, and coal in the worlds currently operating fields and mines would take us beyond 2C of warming.

- The reserves in currently operating oil and gas fields alone, even with no coal, would take the world beyond 1.5C.

- With the necessary decline in production over the coming decades to meet climate goals, clean energy can be scaled up at a corresponding pace, expanding the total number of energy jobs.

**Key Recommendations**:

- No new fossil fuel extraction or transportation infrastructure should be built, and governments should grant no new permits for them.

- Some fields and mines  primarily in rich countries  should be closed before fully exploiting their resources, and financial support should be provided for non-carbon development in poorer countries.

- This does not mean stopping using all fossil fuels overnight. Governments and companies should conduct a managed decline of the fossil fuel industry and ensure a just transition for the workers and communities that depend on it.

<TEXT> Study: [Radiocarbon constraints imply reduced carbon uptake by soils during the 21st century](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6306/1419)
___


**Abstract**:

Soil is the largest terrestrial carbon reservoir and may influence the sign and magnitude of carbon cycleclimate feedbacks. Many Earth system models (ESMs) estimate a significant soil carbon sink by 2100, yet the underlying carbon dynamics determining this response have not been systematically tested against observations. We used 14C data from 157 globally distributed soil profiles sampled to 1-meter depth to show that ESMs underestimated the mean age of soil carbon by a factor of more than six (430  50 years versus 3100  1800 years). Consequently, ESMs overestimated the carbon sequestration potential of soils by a factor of nearly two (40  27%). These inconsistencies suggest that ESMs must better represent carbon stabilization processes and the turnover time of slow and passive reservoirs when simulating future atmospheric carbon dioxide dynamics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Rising plant-mediated methane emissions from arctic wetlands](https://eos.org/articles/aquatic-plants-may-accelerate-arctic-methane-emissions)
___

**Abstract**:

Plant-mediated CH4 flux is an important pathway for landatmosphere CH4 emissions, but the magnitude, timing, and environmental controls, spanning scales of space and time, remain poorly understood in arctic tundra wetlands, particularly under the long-term effects of climate change. CH4 fluxes were measured in situ during peak growing season for the dominant aquatic emergent plants in the Alaskan arctic coastal plain, Carex aquatilis and Arctophila fulva, to assess the magnitude and species-specific controls on CH4 flux. Plant biomass was a strong predictor of A. fulva CH4 flux while water depth and thaw depth were copredictors for C. aquatilis CH4 flux. We used plant and environmental data from 1971 to 1972 from the historic International Biological Program (IBP) research site near Barrow, Alaska, which we resampled in 20102013, to quantify changes in plant biomass and thaw depth, and used these to estimate species-specific decadal-scale changes in CH4 fluxes. A ~60% increase in CH4 flux was estimated from the observed plant biomass and thaw depth increases in tundra ponds over the past 40 years. Despite covering only ~5% of the landscape, we estimate that aquatic C. aquatilis and A. fulva account for two-thirds of the total regional CH4 flux of the Barrow Peninsula. The regionally observed increases in plant biomass and active layer thickening over the past 40 years not only have major implications for energy and water balance, but also have significantly altered landatmosphere CH4 emissions for this region, potentially acting as a positive feedback to climate warming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [The role of sea ice for vascular plant dispersal in the Arctic](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/12/9/20160264)

**Abstract**:

Sea ice has been suggested to be an important factor for dispersal of vascular plants in the Arctic. To assess its role for postglacial colonization in the North Atlantic region, we compiled data on the first Late Glacial to Holocene occurrence of vascular plant species in East Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Svalbard. For each record, we reconstructed likely past dispersal events using data on species distributions and genetics. We compared these data to sea-ice reconstructions to evaluate the potential role of sea ice in these past colonization events and finally evaluated these results using a compilation of driftwood records as an independent source of evidence that sea ice can disperse biological material. Our results show that sea ice was, in general, more prevalent along the most likely dispersal routes at times of assumed first colonization than along other possible routes. Also, driftwood is frequently dispersed in regions that have sea ice today. Thus, sea ice may act as an important dispersal agent. Melting sea ice may hamper future dispersal of Arctic plants and thereby cause more genetic differentiation. It may also limit the northwards expansion of competing boreal species, and hence favour the persistence of Arctic species.

Study: [Timing of ice retreat alters seabird abundances and distributions in the southeast Bering Sea](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/12/9/20160276)

**Abstract**:

Timing of spring sea-ice retreat shapes the southeast Bering Sea food web. We compared summer seabird densities and average bathymetry depth distributions between years with early (typically warm) and late (typically cold) ice retreat. Averaged over all seabird species, densities in early-ice-retreat-years were 10.1% (95% CI: 1.147.9%) of that in late-ice-retreat-years. In early-ice-retreat-years, surface-foraging species had increased numbers over the middle shelf (50150 m) and reduced numbers over the shelf slope (200500 m). Pursuit-diving seabirds showed a less clear trend. Euphausiids and the copepod Calanus marshallae/glacialis were 2.4 and 18.1 times less abundant in early-ice-retreat-years, respectively, whereas age-0 walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus near-surface densities were 51 higher in early-ice-retreat-years. Our results suggest a mechanistic understanding of how present and future changes in sea-ice-retreat timing may affect top predators like seabirds in the southeastern Bering Sea.

Study: [Loss of connectivity among island-dwelling Peary caribou following sea ice decline](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/12/9/20160235)

**Abstract**:

Global warming threatens to reduce population connectivity for terrestrial wildlife through significant and rapid changes to sea ice. Using genetic fingerprinting, we contrasted extant connectivity in island-dwelling Peary caribou in northern Canada with continental-migratory caribou. We next examined if sea-ice contractions in the last decades modulated population connectivity and explored the possible impact of future climate change on long-term connectivity among island caribou. We found a strong correlation between genetic and geodesic distances for both continental and Peary caribou, even after accounting for the possible effect of sea surface. Sea ice has thus been an effective corridor for Peary caribou, promoting inter-island connectivity and population mixing. Using a time series of remote sensing sea-ice data, we show that landscape resistance in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago has increased by approximately 15% since 1979 and may further increase by 2077% by 2086 under a high-emission scenario (RCP8.5). Under the persistent increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, reduced connectivity may isolate island-dwelling caribou with potentially significant consequences for population viability. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Marine diatoms in tillites along the Transantarctic Mountains (TAMs) have been used to suggest a diminished East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) during Pliocene warm periods. Updated ice-sheet modelling shows significant Pliocene EAIS retreat, creating marine embayments into the Wilkes and Aurora basins that were conducive to high diatom productivity and rapid accumulation of diatomaceous sediments. Here we show that subsequent isostatic uplift exposed accumulated unconsolidated marine deposits to wind erosion. We report new atmospheric modelling utilizing Pliocene climate and derived Antarctic landscapes indicating that prevailing mid-altitude winds transported diatoms towards the TAMs, dominantly from extensive emerged coastal deposits of the Aurora Basin. This result unifies leading ideas from competing sides of a contentious debate about the origin of the diatoms in the TAMs and their link to EAIS history, supporting the view that parts of the EAIS are vulnerable to relatively modest warming, with possible implications for future sea-level rise. </TEXT>

Motivated by the impacts of these concurrent temperature extremes and the intrinsic atmospheric linkage between weather conditions in the western and eastern United States, we investigate the occurrence of concurrent warm-West/cool-East surface temperature anomalies, which we call the North American winter temperature dipole. We find that, historically, warm-West/cool-East dipole conditions have been associated with anomalous mid-tropospheric ridging over western North America and downstream troughing over eastern North America. We also find that the occurrence and severity of warm-West/cool-East events have increased significantly between 1980 and 2015, driven largely by an increase in the frequency with which high-amplitude ridge-trough wave patterns result in simultaneous severe temperature conditions in both the West and East. Using a large single-model ensemble of climate simulations, we show that the observed positive trend in the warm-West/cool-East events is attributable to historical anthropogenic emissions including greenhouse gases, but that the co-occurrence of extreme western warmth and eastern cold will likely decrease in the future as winter temperatures warm dramatically across the continent, thereby reducing the occurrence of severely cold conditions in the East. Although our analysis is focused on one particular region, our analysis framework is generally transferable to the physical conditions shaping different types of extreme events around the globe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Public health impacts of the severe haze in Equatorial Asia in SeptemberOctober 2015: demonstration of a new framework for informing fire management strategies to reduce downwind smoke exposure](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/9/094023)
___

**Abstract**: 

In SeptemberOctober 2015, El Nio and positive Indian Ocean Dipole conditions set the stage for massive fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo), leading to persistently hazardous levels of smoke pollution across much of Equatorial Asia. Here we quantify the emission sources and health impacts of this haze episode and compare the sources and impacts to an event of similar magnitude occurring under similar meteorological conditions in SeptemberOctober 2006. Using the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, we first calculate the influence of potential fire emissions across the domain on smoke concentrations in three receptor areas downwindIndonesia, Malaysia, and Singaporeduring the 2006 event. This step maps the sensitivity of each receptor to fire emissions in each grid cell upwind. We then combine these sensitivities with 2006 and 2015 fire emission inventories from the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) to estimate the resulting population-weighted smoke exposure. This method, which assumes similar smoke transport pathways in 2006 and 2015, allows near real-time assessment of smoke pollution exposure, and therefore the consequent morbidity and premature mortality, due to severe haze. Our approach also provides rapid assessment of the relative contribution of fire emissions generated in a specific province to smoke-related health impacts in the receptor areas. We estimate that haze in 2015 resulted in 100 300 excess deaths across Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, more than double those of the 2006 event, with much of the increase due to fires in Indonesia's South Sumatra Province. The model framework we introduce in this study can rapidly identify those areas where land use management to reduce and/or avoid fires would yield the greatest benefit to human health, both nationally and regionally. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Simulating the Pineapple Express in the half degree Community Climate System Model, CCSM4](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL069476/abstract)

**Abstract**:

Atmospheric rivers are recognized as major contributors to the poleward transport of water vapor. Upon reaching land, these phenomena also play a critical role in extreme precipitation and flooding events. The Pineapple Express (PE) is defined as an atmospheric river extending out of the deep tropics and reaching the west coast of North America. Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) high-resolution ensemble simulations for the twentieth and 21st centuries are diagnosed to identify the PE. Analysis of the twentieth century simulations indicated that the CCSM4 accurately captures the spatial and temporal climatology of the PE. Analysis of the end 21st century simulations indicates a significant increase in storm duration and intensity of precipitation associated with landfall of the PE. Only a modest increase in the number of atmospheric rivers of a few percent is projected for the end of 21st century.

Study: [Atmospheric river landfall-latitude changes in future climate simulations](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL070470/abstract)

**Abstract**:

The latitude of landfall for atmospheric rivers (ARs) is examined in the fully coupled half-degree version of the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4) for warm future climate simulations. Two regions are examined: U.S. West Coast/North Pacific ARs and United Kingdom/North Atlantic ARs. Changes in AR landfall-latitude reflect changes in the atmospheric steering flow. West Coast U.S. ARs are projected to push equatorward in response to the subtropical jet climate change. UK AR response is dominated by eddy-driven jets and is seasonally dependent. UK simulated AR response is modest in the winter with the largest relative changes occurring in the seasonal transition months. Precipitation associated with ARs is also projected to increase in intensity under global warming. CCSM4 projects a marked shift to higher rainfall rates for Southern California. Small to modest rainfall rates may increase for all UK latitudes, for the Pacific Northwest, and central and northern California. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Uranium Mining and Milling in Canada](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.5b06072)
___

**Abstract**:

Life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the production of nuclear power (in g CO2e/kWh) are uncertain due partly to a paucity of data on emissions from individual phases of the nuclear fuel cycle. Here, we present the first comprehensive life cycle assessment of GHG emissions produced from the mining and milling of uranium in Canada. The study includes data from 20062013 for two uranium mine-mill operations in northern Saskatchewan (SK) and data from 19952010 for a third SK mine-mill operation. The mine-mill operations were determined to have GHG emissions intensities of 81, 64, and 34 kg CO2e/kg U3O8 at average ore grades of 0.74%, 1.54%, and 4.53% U3O8, respectively. The production-weighted average GHG emission intensity is 42 kg CO2e/kg U3O8 at an average ore grade of 3.81% U3O8. The production-weighted average GHG emission intensity drops to 24 kg CO2e/kg U3O8 when the local hydroelectric GHG emission factor (7.2 g CO2e/kWh) is substituted for the SK grid-average electricity GHG emission factor (768 g CO2e/kWh). This results in Canadian uranium mining-milling contributing only 1.1 g CO2e/kWh to total life cycle GHG emissions from the nuclear fuel cycle (0.7 g CO2e/kWh using the local hydroelectric emission factor). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Prolonged California aridity linked to climate warming and Pacific sea surface temperature](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep33325)
___

**Abstract**:

California has experienced a dry 21st century capped by severe drought from 2012 through 2015 prompting questions about hydroclimatic sensitivity to anthropogenic climate change and implications for the future. We address these questions using a Holocene lake sediment record of hydrologic change from the Sierra Nevada Mountains coupled with marine sediment records from the Pacific. These data provide evidence of a persistent relationship between past climate warming, Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) shifts and centennial to millennial episodes of California aridity. The link is most evident during the thermal-maximum of the mid-Holocene (~8 to 3ka; ka = 1,000 calendar years before present) and during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) (~1ka to 0.7ka). In both cases, climate warming corresponded with cooling of the eastern tropical Pacific despite differences in the factors producing increased radiative forcing. The magnitude of prolonged eastern Pacific cooling was modest, similar to observed La Nia excursions of 1o to 2C. Given differences with current radiative forcing it remains uncertain if the Pacific will react in a similar manner in the 21st century, but should it follow apparent past behavior more intense and prolonged aridity in California would result. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **According to literature on 1.5C pathways , such as i.e. Rogelj et al. (2015)^36 ,worldwide CO2 emissions from energy and industry would have to reach zero around 2050 to stay within a 50% chance of returning warming to below 1.5C by 2100.** Assuming an average car lifetime of 15 years, this implies that the last ICE vehicle would have to be sold roughly in 2035. Note that the 2050 timeframe refers to global emissions; realistically speaking, this timeline would have to be shortened for developed countries, to give other regions more time to develop, along with financial support from developed to developing countries.

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Sea-ice indicators of polar bear habitat](http://www.the-cryosphere.net/10/2027/2016/)
___

**Abstract**:

Nineteen subpopulations of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are found throughout the circumpolar Arctic, and in all regions they depend on sea ice as a platform for traveling, hunting, and breeding. Therefore polar bear phenology  the cycle of biological events  is linked to the timing of sea-ice retreat in spring and advance in fall. We analyzed the dates of sea-ice retreat and advance in all 19 polar bear subpopulation regions from 1979 to 2014, using daily sea-ice concentration data from satellite passive microwave instruments. We define the dates of sea-ice retreat and advance in a region as the dates when the area of sea ice drops below a certain threshold (retreat) on its way to the summer minimum or rises above the threshold (advance) on its way to the winter maximum. The threshold is chosen to be halfway between the historical (19792014) mean September and mean March sea-ice areas. In all 19 regions there is a trend toward earlier sea-ice retreat and later sea-ice advance. Trends generally range from 3 to 9 days decade^1 in spring and from +3 to +9 days decade^1 in fall, with larger trends in the Barents Sea and central Arctic Basin. The trends are not sensitive to the threshold. We also calculated the number of days per year that the sea-ice area exceeded the threshold (termed ice-covered days) and the average sea-ice concentration from 1 June through 31 October. The number of ice-covered days is declining in all regions at the rate of 7 to 19 days decade^1 , with larger trends in the Barents Sea and central Arctic Basin. The JuneOctober sea-ice concentration is declining in all regions at rates ranging from 1 to 9 percent decade^1 . These sea-ice metrics (or indicators of habitat change) were designed to be useful for management agencies and for comparative purposes among subpopulations. We recommend that the National Climate Assessment include the timing of sea-ice retreat and advance in future reports. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Sea-ice indicators of polar bear habitat](http://www.the-cryosphere.net/10/2027/2016/)
___

**Abstract**:

Nineteen subpopulations of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are found throughout the circumpolar Arctic, and in all regions they depend on sea ice as a platform for traveling, hunting, and breeding. Therefore polar bear phenology  the cycle of biological events  is linked to the timing of sea-ice retreat in spring and advance in fall. We analyzed the dates of sea-ice retreat and advance in all 19 polar bear subpopulation regions from 1979 to 2014, using daily sea-ice concentration data from satellite passive microwave instruments. We define the dates of sea-ice retreat and advance in a region as the dates when the area of sea ice drops below a certain threshold (retreat) on its way to the summer minimum or rises above the threshold (advance) on its way to the winter maximum. The threshold is chosen to be halfway between the historical (19792014) mean September and mean March sea-ice areas. In all 19 regions there is a trend toward earlier sea-ice retreat and later sea-ice advance. Trends generally range from 3 to 9 days decade^1 in spring and from +3 to +9 days decade^1 in fall, with larger trends in the Barents Sea and central Arctic Basin. The trends are not sensitive to the threshold. We also calculated the number of days per year that the sea-ice area exceeded the threshold (termed ice-covered days) and the average sea-ice concentration from 1 June through 31 October. The number of ice-covered days is declining in all regions at the rate of 7 to 19 days decade^1 , with larger trends in the Barents Sea and central Arctic Basin. The JuneOctober sea-ice concentration is declining in all regions at rates ranging from 1 to 9 percent decade^1 . These sea-ice metrics (or indicators of habitat change) were designed to be useful for management agencies and for comparative purposes among subpopulations. We recommend that the National Climate Assessment include the timing of sea-ice retreat and advance in future reports. </TEXT>

waste disposal is a problem that has not been solved, and pretending that it doesn't matter is silly.

While it is certainly of concern, it's not the be-all and end-all of the nuclear discussion. For one, the amount of nuclear waste is minuscule relative to other energy source, and it doesn't necessarily have to be waste. Let's not forget about the shortage of medical isotopes either.

http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-wastes/radioactive-waste-management.aspx

What to do with nuclear waste, while problematic to some degree, should not be a debate that prevents the world from reducing its emissions when it's amongst the top global issues, if not thee most important issue of our time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [A Cold-Wet Mid-Latitude Environment on Mars during the Hesperian-Amazonian Transition: Evidence from Northern Arabia Valleys and Paleolakes](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JE005052/full)
___

**Abstract**

The growing inventory of post-Noachian fluvial valleys may represent a late, widespread episode of aqueous activity on Mars, contrary to the paradigm that fluvial activity largely ceased around the Noachian-Hesperian boundary. Fresh shallow valleys (FSVs) are widespread from ~30-45 in both hemispheres with a high concentration in northern Arabia Terra. Valleys in northern Arabia Terra characteristically start abruptly on steeper slopes and terminate in topographic depressions at elevations corresponding to model-predicted lake levels. Longer valley systems flowed into and out of chains of paleolakes. Minimum discharges based on the dimensions of the incised channel assuming medium to coarse sand-size grains ranges from 10s to 100 s m^3  s^-1 , respectively, consistent with formation via snowmelt from surface or sub-ice flows. Hydrologic calculations indicate the valleys likely formed in hundreds of years or less, and crater statistics constrain the timing of fluvial activity to between the Hesperian and mid Amazonian. Several craters with channels extending radially outward supports evidence for overflow of interior crater lakes possibly fed by groundwater. Most FSVs occur away from young impact craters which makes an association with impact processes improbable. The widespread occurrence of FSVs along with their similar morphology and shared modest state of degradation is consistent with most forming during a global interval of favorable climate, perhaps contemporaneous with alluvial fan formation in equatorial and mid-latitudes. Evidence for a snowmelt based hydrology and considerable depths of water on the landscape in Arabia supports a cold, wet and possibly habitable environment late in Martian history. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Curious why you stopped reading after "not even the Japanese can do safe nuclear plants"?

Because it implies (and I of course may be mistaken) that nuclear plants aren't safe no matter who builds them. This is simply outright false. There are currently [442](https://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/n/nuclear-power-plant-world-wide.htm) operating nuclear reactors world wide. During the entire history a total of two have had catastrophic failures of which only chernobyl has attributed deaths directly linked to radiation exposure. If you want to shut down all nuclear reactors because of a catastrophic failure then you're also going to have to shut down every hydroelectric dam. The [Banqiao Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banqiao_Dam) failure resulted in an estimated 171,000 deaths, and 11 million people losing their homes. 

Environmental activism (Greenpeace, etc) fly in the face of greater scientific committees such as the IPCC which supports rapid expansion of nuclear reactors to mitigate global climate change. The fact remains that while the end goal of reaching total renewable energy sources is ideal, the path to achieving net negative emissions cannot be achieved by the fastest path possible without the further development of nuclear energy.

at least from an environmental activism perspective, [Greenpeace, NRDC] have good reputations.

That's called the [echo chamber effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Primitive Solar System materials and Earth share a common initial 142Nd abundance](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v537/n7620/full/nature19351.html)
___

**Abstract**:

The early evolution of planetesimals and planets can be constrained using variations in the abundance of neodymium-142 (142Nd), which arise from the initial distribution of 142Nd within the protoplanetary disk and the radioactive decay of the short-lived samarium-146 isotope (146Sm). The apparent offset in 142Nd abundance found previously between chondritic meteorites and Earth has been interpreted either as a possible consequence of nucleosynthetic variations within the protoplanetary disk or as a function of the differentiation of Earth very early in its history. Here we report high-precision Sm and Nd stable and radiogenic isotopic compositions of four calciumaluminium-rich refractory inclusions (CAIs) from three CV-type carbonaceous chondrites, and of three whole-rock samples of unequilibrated enstatite chondrites. The CAIs, which are the first solids formed by condensation from the nebular gas, provide the best constraints for the isotopic evolution of the early Solar System. Using the mineral isochron method for individual CAIs, we find that CAIs without isotopic anomalies in Nd compared to the terrestrial composition share a 146Sm/144Sm142Nd/144Nd isotopic evolution with Earth. The average 142Nd/144Nd composition for pristine enstatite chondrites that we calculate coincides with that of the accessible silicate layers of Earth. This relationship between CAIs, enstatite chondrites and Earth can only be a result of Earth having inherited the same initial abundance of 142Nd and chondritic proportions of Sm and Nd. Consequently, 142Nd isotopic heterogeneities found in other CAIs and among chondrite groups may arise from extrasolar grains that were present in the disk and incorporated in different proportions into these planetary objects. Our finding supports a chondritic Sm/Nd ratio for the bulk silicate Earth and, as a consequence, chondritic abundances for other refractory elements. It also removes the need for a hidden reservoir or for collisional erosion scenarios to explain the 142Nd/144Nd composition of Earth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Substantial role of macroalgae in marine carbon sequestration](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/ngeo2790.pdf)
___

**Abstract**:

Vegetated coastal habitats have been identified as important carbon sinks. In contrast to angiosperm-based habitats such as seagrass meadows, salt marshes and mangroves, marine macroalgae have largely been excluded from discussions of marine carbon sinks. Macroalgae are the dominant primary producers in the coastal zone, but they typically do not grow in habitats that are considered to accumulate large stocks of organic carbon. However, the presence of macroalgal carbon in the deep sea and sediments, where it is effectively sequestered from the atmosphere, has been reported. A synthesis of these data suggests that macroalgae could represent an important source of the carbon sequestered in marine sediments and the deep ocean. We propose two main modes for the transport of macroalgae to the deep ocean and sediments: macroalgal material drifting through submarine canyons, and the sinking of negatively buoyant macroalgal detritus. A rough estimate suggests that macroalgae could sequester about 173 TgC yr^1 (with a range of 61268 TgC yr^1 ) globally. About 90% of this sequestration occurs through export to the deep sea, and the rest through burial in coastal sediments. This estimate exceeds that for carbon sequestered in angiosperm-based coastal habitats. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [The formation of Charons red poles from seasonally cold-trapped volatiles](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature19340.html)
___

**Abstract**:

A unique feature of Plutos large satellite Charon is its dark red northern polar cap. Similar colours on Plutos surface have been attributed to tholin-like organic macromolecules produced by energetic radiation processing of hydrocarbons. The polar location on Charon implicates the temperature extremes that result from Charons high obliquity and long seasons in the production of this material. The escape of Plutos atmosphere provides a potential feedstock for a complex chemistry. Gas from Pluto that is transiently cold-trapped and processed at Charons winter pole was proposed as an explanation for the dark coloration on the basis of an image of Charons northern hemisphere, but not modelled quantitatively. Here we report images of the southern hemisphere illuminated by Pluto-shine and also images taken during the approach phase that show the northern polar cap over a range of longitudes. We model the surface thermal environment on Charon and the supply and temporary cold-trapping of material escaping from Pluto, as well as the photolytic processing of this material into more complex and less volatile molecules while cold-trapped. The model results are consistent with the proposed mechanism for producing the observed colour pattern on Charon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Mass Loss Rates of Fasting Polar Bears](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/687988)
___

**Abstract**

Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) have adapted to an annual cyclic regime of feeding and fasting, which is extreme in seasonal sea ice regions of the Arctic. As a consequence of climate change, sea ice breakup has become earlier and the duration of the open-water period through which polar bears must rely on fat reserves has increased. To date, there is limited empirical data with which to evaluate the potential energetic capacity of polar bears to withstand longer fasts. We measured the incoming and outgoing mass of inactive polar bears (n = 142) that were temporarily detained by Manitoba Conservation and Water Stewardship during the open-water period near the town of Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, in 20092014. Polar bears were given access to water but not food and held for a median length of 17 d. Median mass loss rates were 1.0 kg/d, while median mass-specific loss rates were 0.5%/d, similar to other species with high adiposity and prolonged fasting capacities. Mass loss by unfed captive adult males was identical to that lost by free-ranging individuals, suggesting that terrestrial feeding contributes little to offset mass loss. The inferred metabolic rate was comparable to a basal mammalian rate, suggesting that while on land, polar bears can maintain a depressed metabolic rate to conserve energy. Finally, we estimated time to starvation for subadults and adult males for the on-land period. Results suggest that at 180 d of fasting, 56%63% of subadults and 18%24% of adult males in this study would die of starvation. Results corroborate previous assessments on the limits of polar bear capacity to withstand lengthening ice-free seasons and emphasize the greater sensitivity of subadults to changes in sea ice phenology. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Abstract**

The Arctic plays a fundamental role in the climate system and has shown significant climate change in recent decades, including the Arctic warming and decline of Arctic sea-ice extent and thickness. In contrast to the Arctic warming and reduction of Arctic sea ice, Europe, East Asia and North America have experienced anomalously cold conditions, with record snowfall during recent years. In this paper, we review current understanding of the sea-ice impacts on the Eurasian climate. Paleo, observational and modelling studies are covered to summarize several major themes, including: the variability of Arctic sea ice and its controls; the likely causes and apparent impacts of the Arctic sea-ice decline during the satellite era, as well as past and projected future impacts and trends; the links and feedback mechanisms between the Arctic sea ice and the Arctic Oscillation/North Atlantic Oscillation, the recent Eurasian cooling, winter atmospheric circulation, summer precipitation in East Asia, spring snowfall over Eurasia, East Asian winter monsoon, and midlatitude extreme weather; and the remote climate response (e.g., atmospheric circulation, air temperature) to changes in Arctic sea ice. We conclude with a brief summary and suggestions for future research. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Similar estimates of temperature impacts on global wheat yield by three independent methods](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3115.html)
___

**Abstract**:

The potential impact of global temperature change on global crop yield has recently been assessed with different methods. Here we show that grid-based and point-based simulations and statistical regressions (from historic records), without deliberate adaptation or CO2 fertilization effects, produce similar estimates of temperature impact on wheat yields at global and national scales. With a 1C global temperature increase, global wheat yield is projected to decline between 4.1% and 6.4%. Projected relative temperature impacts from different methods were similar for major wheat-producing countries China, India, USA and France, but less so for Russia. Point-based and grid-based simulations, and to some extent the statistical regressions, were consistent in projecting that warmer regions are likely to suffer more yield loss with increasing temperature than cooler regions. By forming a multi-method ensemble, it was possible to quantify method uncertainty in addition to model uncertainty. This significantly improves confidence in estimates of climate impacts on global food security. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Atmospheric methane isotopic record favors fossil sources flat in 1980s and 1990s with recent increase](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/09/06/1522923113)
___

**Significance**

There is no scientific consensus on the drivers of the atmospheric methane growth rate over the past three decades. Here, we report carbon and hydrogen isotopic measurements of atmospheric methane in archived air samples collected 19771998, and modeling of these with more contemporary data to infer changes in methane sources over the period 19842009. We present strong evidence that methane emissions from fossil fuel sectors were approximately constant in the 1980s and 1990s but increased significantly between 2000 and 2009. This finding challenges recent conclusions based on atmospheric ethane that fugitive fossil fuel emissions fell during much of this period. Emissions from other anthropogenic sources also increased, but were partially offset by reductions in wetland and fire emissions.

**Abstract**

Observations of atmospheric methane (CH4) since the late 1970s and measurements of CH4 trapped in ice and snow reveal a meteoric rise in concentration during much of the twentieth century. Since 1750, levels of atmospheric CH4 have more than doubled to current globally averaged concentration near 1,800 ppb. During the late 1980s and 1990s, the CH4 growth rate slowed substantially and was near or at zero between 1999 and 2006. There is no scientific consensus on the drivers of this slowdown. Here, we report measurements of the stable isotopic composition of atmospheric CH4 (13C/12C and D/H) from a rare air archive dating from 1977 to 1998. Together with more modern records of isotopic atmospheric CH4, we performed a time-dependent retrieval of methane fluxes spanning 25 y (19842009) using a 3D chemical transport model. This inversion results in a 24 [18, 27] Tg y^1 CH4 increase in fugitive fossil fuel emissions since 1984 with most of this growth occurring after year 2000. This result is consistent with some bottom-up emissions inventories but not with recent estimates based on atmospheric ethane. In fact, when forced with decreasing emissions from fossil fuel sources our inversion estimates unreasonably high emissions in other sources. Further, the inversion estimates a decrease in biomass-burning emissions that could explain falling ethane abundance. A range of sensitivity tests suggests that these results are robust.

<TEXT> It's been a while since I last visited the topic so please forgive me if I don't recall the majority of criticisms towards it. That being said I can recall a couple.

1) Cowspiracy pulls a lot of their information from a 2006 UN FAO study, "Tackling Climate Change Through Livestock: a global assessment of emissions and mitigation opportunities." The film was released in 2014 and given the wide criticisms of the 2006 study the UN actually released a revised revision in 2013. Why they insisted in reporting values from the 2006 report instead of the 2013 revised report when the film was released in 2014 is anyone's guess. Note too that the 2013 report is about reducing GHG emissions through better management, and doesn't suggest people stop eating meat. 

2) They cherry picked their facts, in some instances having questionable sources, in order to custom tailor their message. For example they state the following two 'facts': 

a) Livestock and their byproducts account for at least 32,000 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, or 51% of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions.     

and 

b) US Methane emissions from livestock and natural gas are nearly equal.

(a) uses questionable sources, and is actually incorrect while (b) uses a credible source and is correct (though they purposely leave out that CH4 emissions from industry remain the larger contributor and not agriculture). However, values for CO2 emissions are also available from the source they used for (b)  - the EPA -  which states that industry is the largest emissions source of CO2 globally, and emissions from agriculture, forestry and land use account for [~24%](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data) of global CO2 emissions, not the 51% they claim. So why did they use the a credible source for claim (b) and opt to not use the same source for claim (a) when the information is so readily available? Cherry picking facts is generally a red flag of an agenda driven bias. Furthermore, with the boom in unconventional shale gas production across much of North America and better estimates of emissions on CH4 relating to the industry it's very likely that agricultural emissions make up far less than initially reported. 

Of course there are other claims as well, and misleading statements, but I don't have the time to do *all* the foot work. Hopefully I've demonstrated why Cowspiracy should not be viewed as unbiased, or entirely trust worthy, and one should refer to more credible sources such as those I've already mentioned such as the IPCC.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  have these people not seen the documentary Cowspiracy?

That documentary is highly bias, and as such, I would not recommend it. It uses hyperbole and misleading claims in order to form a persuasive argument. The way to inform people is not by misleading or exaggerating 'facts.' 

The best information available can be found here: https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/

Stopping the consumption of meat is not the answer. Proper land use and feed management, enforcement of regulations, reducing overall consumption, and changing the type (ie. less beef, more fish and chicken or other types) of meat are far more pragmatic approaches. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I, the OP (original poster), did not write this article; however, the author [Jason Hickel](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jason-hickel) did. 

I'd be just as cautious to write this article off as I would to take it as gospel. 

... dismissing other solutions to carbon sequestration

And rightly so. There are currently no methods of CCS that can be scaled such that they actually have a significant impact on CO2 emissions. At the lower end, Hickel (not OP - ie. me) suggests 3-15% which is well beyond anything developed thus far relating to CSS.

By masquerading as exposition of reliable scientific consensus...

Hickel didn't do that though. He clearly stated that the study was not yet peer reviewed and the title itself does not lean in favor of any scientific certainty using the following, "*might be*." (it's also why I posted it here, and not under /r/science )

There is a reason to be skeptical of silver bullets for complex, multifaceted global issues.

Hickel is not suggesting you drop every possible solution to solving our current scenario, and he does give reason in the article to be skeptical, stating that it's not yet peer-reviewed. On the other hand, his underlying message is correct based purely on the other two studies he links to - that is that better soil management can play a significant role in mitigating anthropogenic global warming. 

In my view, Hickel is simply saying, 'Hey, look at this, it's worth considering and taking a closer look at.' And, to that effect he's absolutely correct. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Social and economic impacts of climate](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6304/aad9837)
___

**BACKGROUND**

For centuries, thinkers have considered whether and how climatic conditions influence the nature of societies and the performance of economies. A multidisciplinary renaissance of quantitative empirical research has begun to illuminate key linkages in the coupling of these complex natural and human systems, uncovering notable effects of climate on health, agriculture, economics, conflict, migration, and demographics. 

**ADVANCES**

Past scholars of climate-society interactions were limited to theorizing on the basis of anecdotal evidence; advances in computing, data availability, and study design now allow researchers to draw generalizable causal inferences tying climatic events to social outcomes. This endeavor has demonstrated that a range of climate factors have substantial influence on societies and economies, both past and present, with important implications for the future.

Temperature, in particular, exerts remarkable influence over human systems at many social scales; heat induces mortality, has lasting impact on fetuses and infants, and incites aggression and violence while lowering human productivity. High temperatures also damage crops, inflate electricity demand, and may trigger population movements within and across national borders. Tropical cyclones cause mortality, damage assets, and reduce economic output for long periods. Precipitation extremes harm economies and populations predominately in agriculturally dependent settings. These effects are often quantitatively substantial; for example, we compute that temperature depresses current U.S. maize yields roughly 48%, warming trends since 1980 elevated conflict risk in Africa by 11%, and future warming may slow global economic growth rates by 0.28 percentage points year^1.

Much research aims to forecast impacts of future climate change, but we point out that society may also benefit from attending to ongoing impacts of climate in the present, because current climatic conditions impose economic and social burdens on populations today that rival in magnitude the projected end-of-century impacts of climate change. For instance, we calculate that current temperature climatologies slow global economic growth roughly 0.25 percentage points year^1 , comparable to the additional slowing of 0.28 percentage points year^1 projected from future warming.

Both current and future losses can theoretically be avoided if populations adapt to fully insulate themselves from the climatewhy this has not already occurred everywhere remains a critical open question. For example, clear patterns of adaptation in health impacts and in response to tropical cyclones contrast strongly with limited adaptation in agricultural and macroeconomic responses to temperature. Although some theories suggest these various levels of adaptation ought to be economically optimal, in the sense that costs of additional adaptive actions should exactly balance the benefits of avoided climate-related losses, there is no evidence that allows us to determine how closely observed adaptation gaps reflect optimal investments or constrained suboptimal adaptation that should be addressed through policy. 

**OUTLOOK**

Recent findings provide insight into the historical evolution of the global economy; they should inform how we respond to modern climatic conditions, and they can guide how we understand the consequences of future climate changes. Although climate is clearly not the only factor that affects social and economic outcomes, new quantitative measurements reveal that it is a major factor, often with first-order consequences. Research over the coming decade will seek to understand the numerous mechanisms that drive these effects, with the hope that policy may interfere with the most damaging pathways of influence.

Both current and future generations will benefit from near-term investigations. Cracking the code on when, where, and why adaptation is or is not successful will generate major social benefits today and in the future. In addition, calculations used to design global climate change policies require as input damage functions that describe how social and economic losses accrue under different climatic conditions, essential elements that now can (and should) be calibrated to real-world relationships. Designing effective, efficient, and fair policies to manage anthropogenic climate change requires that we possess a quantitative grasp of how different investments today may affect economic and social possibilities in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Sub-lethal effects of dietary neonicotinoid insecticide exposure on honey bee queen fecundity and colony development](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep32108)
___

**Abstract**:

Many factors can negatively affect honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) health including the pervasive use of systemic neonicotinoid insecticides. Through direct consumption of contaminated nectar and pollen from treated plants, neonicotinoids can affect foraging, learning, and memory in worker bees. Less well studied are the potential effects of neonicotinoids on queen bees, which may be exposed indirectly through trophallaxis, or food-sharing. To assess effects on queen productivity, small colonies of different sizes (1500, 3000, and 7000 bees) were fed imidacloprid (0, 10, 20, 50, and 100ppb) in syrup for three weeks. We found adverse effects of imidacloprid on queens (egg-laying and locomotor activity), worker bees (foraging and hygienic activities), and colony development (brood production and pollen stores) in all treated colonies. Some effects were less evident as colony size increased, suggesting that larger colony populations may act as a buffer to pesticide exposure. This study is the first to show adverse effects of imidacloprid on queen bee fecundity and behavior and improves our understanding of how neonicotinoids may impair short-term colony functioning. These data indicate that risk-mitigation efforts should focus on reducing neonicotinoid exposure in the early spring when colonies are smallest and queens are most vulnerable to exposure. </TEXT>

NPP is a measure of plant growth. Therefore the significance of NPP in the context of this article is exactly as the title states. That is to say that NPP (the rate at which plants grow) is reduced under post 2050 climate conditions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Nonlinear, interacting responses to climate limit grassland production under global change](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/08/30/1606734113.abstract)
___

**Significance**:

Global environmental change involves many factors that occur simultaneously, yet they are usually studied in isolation. Here we report a long-term global change experiment that subjected California grassland to multiple individual and simultaneous changes in temperature, precipitation, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. Our analysis revealed nonlinear and interactive effects of temperature and precipitation on grassland net primary production (NPP), which defined a ridge-shaped NPP response surface to these two variables. Added nitrogen raised the peak of the NPP response surface, and added CO2 shifted the peak to lower temperatures. Our approach was validated by tests showing an absence of progressive effects over the years. In other ecosystems, our approach may be similarly powerful for probing the effects of multifactor global change.

**Abstract**:

Global changes in climate, atmospheric composition, and pollutants are altering ecosystems and the goods and services they provide. Among approaches for predicting ecosystem responses, long-term observations and manipulative experiments can be powerful approaches for resolving single-factor and interactive effects of global changes on key metrics such as net primary production (NPP). Here we combine both approaches, developing multidimensional response surfaces for NPP based on the longest-running, best-replicated, most-multifactor global-change experiment at the ecosystem scalea 17-y study of California grassland exposed to full-factorial warming, added precipitation, elevated CO2, and nitrogen deposition. Single-factor and interactive effects were not time-dependent, enabling us to analyze each year as a separate realization of the experiment and extract NPP as a continuous function of global-change factors. We found a ridge-shaped response surface in which NPP is humped (unimodal) in response to temperature and precipitation when CO2 and nitrogen are ambient, with peak NPP rising under elevated CO2 or nitrogen but also shifting to lower temperatures. Our results suggest that future climate change will push this ecosystem away from conditions that maximize NPP, but with large year-to-year variability. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [North Atlantic ocean circulation and abrupt climate change during the last glaciation](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2016/06/29/science.aaf5529)
___

**Abstract**:

*The last ice age was characterized by rapid and hemispherically asynchronous climate oscillations, whose origin remains unresolved. Variations in oceanic meridional heat transport may contribute to these repeated climate changes, which were most pronounced during marine isotope stage 3 (MIS3), the glacial interval twenty-five to sixty thousand years ago. We examined climate and ocean circulation proxies throughout this interval at high resolution in a deep North Atlantic sediment core, combining the kinematic tracer Pa/Th with the deep water-mass tracer, 13CBF. These indicators suggest reduced Atlantic overturning circulation during every cool northern stadial, with the greatest reductions during episodic Hudson Strait iceberg discharges, while sharp northern warming followed reinvigorated overturning. These results provide direct evidence for the ocean's persistent, central role in abrupt glacial climate change.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Anthropogenic impact on Antarctic surface mass balance, currently masked by natural variability, to emerge by mid-century](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/9/094001)
___

**Abstract**:

*Global and regional climate models robustly simulate increases in Antarctic surface mass balance (SMB) during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries in response to anthropogenic global warming. Despite these robust model projections, however, observations indicate that there has been no significant change in Antarctic SMB in recent decades. We show that this apparent discrepancy between models and observations can be explained by the fact that the anthropogenic climate change signal during the second half of the twentieth century is small compared to the noise associated with natural climate variability. Using an ensemble of 35 global coupled climate models to separate signal and noise, we find that the forced SMB increase due to global warming in recent decades is unlikely to be detectable as a result of large natural SMB variability. However, our analysis reveals that the anthropogenic impact on Antarctic SMB is very likely to emerge from natural variability by the middle of the current century, thus mitigating future increases in global sea level.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Rapid attribution of the August 2016 flood-inducing extreme precipitation in south Louisiana to climate change](http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci-discuss.net/hess-2016-448/)
___

**Abstract**:

*A stationary low pressure system and elevated levels of precipitable water provided a nearly continuous source of precipitation over Louisiana, United States (U.S.) starting around 10 August, 2016. Precipitation was heaviest in the region broadly encompassing the city of Baton Rouge, with a three-day maximum found at a station in Livingston, LA (east of Baton Rouge) from 1214 August, 2016 (648.3 mm, 25.5 inches). The intense precipitation was followed by inland flash flooding and river flooding and in subsequent days produced additional backwater flooding. On 16 August, Louisiana officials reported that 30,000 people had been rescued, nearly 10,600 people had slept in shelters on the night of 14 August, and at least 60,600 homes had been impacted to varying degrees. As of 17 August, the floods were reported to have killed at least thirteen people. As the disaster was unfolding, the Red Cross called the flooding the worst natural disaster in the U.S. since Super Storm Sandy made landfall in New Jersey on 24 October, 2012. Before the floodwaters had receded, the media began questioning whether this extreme event was caused by anthropogenic climate change. To provide the necessary analysis to understand the potential role of anthropogenic climate change, a rapid attribution analysis was launched in real-time using the best readily available observational data and high-resolution global climate model simulations.*

*The objective of this study is to show the possibility of performing rapid attribution studies when both observational and model data, and analysis methods are readily available upon the start. It is the authors aspiration that the results be used to guide further studies of the devastating precipitation and flooding event. Here we present a first estimate of how anthropogenic climate change has affected the likelihood of a comparable extreme precipitation event in the Central U.S. Gulf Coast. While the flooding event of interest triggering this study occurred in south Louisiana, for the purposes of our analysis, we have defined an extreme precipitation event by taking the spatial maximum of annual 3-day inland maximum precipitation over the region: 2931 N, 8595 W, which we refer to as the Central U.S. Gulf Coast. Using observational data, we find that the observed local return time of the 1214 August precipitation event in 2016 is about 550 years (95 % confidence interval (C.I.): 4501450). The probability for an event like this to happen anywhere in the region is presently 1 in 30 years (C.I. 11110). We estimate that these probabilities and the intensity of extreme precipitation events of this return time have increased since 1900. A Central U.S. Gulf Coast extreme precipitation event has effectively become more likely in 2016 than it was in 1900. The global climate models tell a similar story, with the regional probability of 3-day extreme precipitation increasing due to anthropogenic climate change by a factor of more than a factor 1.4 in the most accurate analyses. The magnitude of the shift in probabilities is greater in the 25 km (higher resolution) climate model than in the 50 km model. The evidence for a relation to El Nio half a year earlier is equivocal, with some analyses showing a positive connection and others none.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Global climate forcing of aerosols embodied in international trade](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2798.html)
___

**Abstract**:

*International trade separates regions consuming goods and services from regions where goods and related aerosol pollution are produced. Yet the role of trade in aerosol climate forcing attributed to different regions has never been quantified. Here, we contrast the direct radiative forcing of aerosols related to regions consumption of goods and services against the forcing due to emissions produced in each region. Aerosols assessed include black carbon, primary organic aerosol, and secondary inorganic aerosols, including sulfate, nitrate and ammonium. We find that global aerosol radiative forcing due to emissions produced in East Asia is much stronger than the forcing related to goods and services ultimately consumed in that region because of its large net export of emissions-intensive goods. The opposite is true for net importers such as Western Europe and North America: global radiative forcing related to consumption is much greater than the forcing due to emissions produced in these regions. Overall, trade is associated with a shift of radiative forcing from net importing to net exporting regions. Compared to greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, the short atmospheric lifetimes of aerosols cause large localized differences between consumption- and production-related radiative forcing. International efforts to reduce emissions in the exporting countries will help alleviate trade-related climate and health impacts of aerosols while lowering global emissions.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Sea ice decline and 21st century trans-Arctic shipping routes](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL069315/full)
___

**Abstract**:

The observed decline in Arctic sea ice is projected to continue, opening shorter trade routes across the Arctic Ocean, with potentially global economic implications. Here we quantify, using CMIP5 global climate model simulations calibrated to remove spatial biases, how projected sea ice loss might increase opportunities for Arctic-transit shipping. By mid-century for standard Open Water vessels, the frequency of navigable periods doubles, with routes across the central Arctic becoming available. A sea ice  ship speed relationship is used to show that European routes to Asia typically become 10 days faster via the Arctic than alternatives by mid-century, and 13 days faster by late-century, while North American routes become 4 days faster. Future greenhouse-gas emissions have a larger impact by late-century; the shipping season reaching 4-8 months in RCP8.5, double that of RCP2.6, both with substantial inter-annual variability. Moderately ice-strengthened vessels likely enable Arctic transits for 10-12 months by late-century.

___

**Abstract**:

*Ongoing ocean warming and acidification are tied to the rapid accumulation of human-induced carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere and subsequent uptake of heat and CO2 by the surface ocean. These processes are expected to drive large changes in marine ecosystems. While numerous studies have examined the effects of ocean acidification on coccolithophores, less is known on their combined effect. In this study, we investigate temperature modulation of the carbonate chemistry sensitivity of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi (RCC1827 from the Western Mediterranean) in a culture experiment. We analyzed the responses of coccolith morphology, particulate inorganic and organic carbon production, and sinking rate of individual cells. E. huxleyi was exposed to three CO2 levels (ca. 400 atm, 900 atm, and 1400 atm) at 15C and 20C. Temperature adds to the negative effect of increasing pCO2 on coccolith morphology, suggesting that a significant number of E. huxleyi strains might suffer from a temperature increase, hampering their evolutionary success. Temperature amplified the positive effect of increasing pCO2 on organic carbon production, while modulating the response of calcification rates, indicating that the response to increasing pCO2 must be taken with caution depending on the temperature range studied. Sinking rates were positively correlated with temperature, whereas pCO2 did not have any effect. The combined effect of carbonate chemistry and temperature on the E. huxleyi ratio between particulate inorganic carbon and particulate organic carbon (PIC/POC) might also lower the sinking rate of aggregates. In conclusion, in a warmer and more acidified ocean, individual coccolithophore cells might sink faster, while aggregates might sink slower.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [The anomalous change in the QBO in 20152016](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL070373/full)
___

**Abstract**:

*The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is a tropical lower stratospheric, downward propagating zonal wind variation, with an average period of ~28months. The QBO has been constantly documented since 1953. Here we describe the evolution of the QBO during the Northern Hemisphere winter of 20152016 using radiosonde observations and meteorological reanalyses. Normally, the QBO would show a steady downward propagation of the westerly phase. In 20152016, there was an anomalous upward displacement of this westerly phase from ~30hPa to 15hPa. These westerlies impinge on or cutoff the normal downward propagation of the easterly phase. In addition, easterly winds develop at 40hPa. Comparisons to tropical wind statistics for the 1953 to present record demonstrate that this 20152016 QBO disruption is unprecedented.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Intensification of landfalling typhoons over the northwest Pacific since the late 1970s](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2792.html)
___

**Abstract**:

*Intensity changes in landfalling typhoons are of great concern to East and Southeast Asian countries. Regional changes in typhoon intensity, however, are poorly known owing to inconsistencies among different data sets. Here, we apply cluster analysis to bias-corrected data and show that, over the past 37 years, typhoons that strike East and Southeast Asia have intensified by 1215%, with the proportion of storms of categories 4 and 5 having doubled or even tripled. In contrast, typhoons that stay over the open ocean have experienced only modest changes. These regional changes are consistent between operational data sets. To identify the physical mechanisms, we decompose intensity changes into contributions from intensification rate and intensification duration. We find that the increased intensity of landfalling typhoons is due to strengthened intensification rates, which in turn are tied to locally enhanced ocean surface warming on the rim of East and Southeast Asia. The projected ocean surface warming pattern under increasing greenhouse gas forcing suggests that typhoons striking eastern mainland China, Taiwan, Korea and Japan will intensify further. Given disproportionate damages by intense typhoons, this represents a heightened threat to people and properties in the region.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> A number of articles are available to you regarding international agreements and their position within the scientific community. A quick search shows some articles that may be of interest to you [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalClimateChange/search?q=paris restrict_sr=on sort=relevance t=all).

In general, it's a mixed view. Some like Mann (iirc) believe such emissions targets are fully attainable, and coming to agreement on these targets is well worth the time and effort. Others, like Hansen^[1](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/james-hansen-climate-change-paris-talks-fraud), however, see COP21 as essentially useless. 

Some would argue that setting a target of 1.5C warming relative to pre-industrial times are pointless as that amount of warming may already be locked in. Whether or not 1.5C of warming relative to pre-industrial times is already locked in depends on what value we assign to the equilibrium climate sensitivity ([ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_sensitivity)). The majority of studies show relatively broad agreement around 3C, which would mean that 1.5C warming is already locked. Should the ECS value be lower, however, then it makes it just that little bit more possible to stay below 1.5C of warming.

It's difficult to predict just how effective such talks are in general, but it is certainly reasonable to suggest that they are a) important and b) capable of having real world effects^[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol) .   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Mechanistic insights into a hydrate contribution to the Paleocene-Eocene carbon cycle perturbation from coupled thermohydraulic simulations](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL069676/abstract)
___
**Abstract**:

During the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), the carbon isotopic signature (13C) of surface carbon-bearing phases decreased abruptly by at least 2.5 to 3.0. This carbon isotope excursion (CIE) has been attributed to widespread methane hydrate dissociation in response to rapid ocean warming. We ran a thermohydraulic modeling code to simulate hydrate dissociation due to ocean warming for various PETM scenarios. Our results show that hydrate dissociation in response to such warming can be rapid but suggest that methane release to the ocean is modest and delayed by hundreds to thousands of years after the onset of dissociation, limiting the potential for positive feedback from emission-induced warming. In all of our simulations at least half of the dissociated hydrate methane remains beneath the seabed, suggesting that the pre-PETM hydrate inventory needed to account for all of the CIE is at least double that required for isotopic mass balance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Recent amplification of the North American winter temperature dipole](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JD025116/full)
___

**Abstract**:

*During the winters of 20132014 and 20142015, anomalously warm temperatures in western North America and anomalously cool temperatures in eastern North America resulted in substantial human and environmental impacts. Motivated by the impacts of these concurrent temperature extremes and the intrinsic atmospheric linkage between weather conditions in the western and eastern United States, we investigate the occurrence of concurrent warm-West/cool-East surface temperature anomalies, which we call the North American winter temperature dipole. We find that, historically, warm-West/cool-East dipole conditions have been associated with anomalous mid-tropospheric ridging over western North America and downstream troughing over eastern North America. We also find that the occurrence and severity of warm-West/cool-East events have increased significantly between 1980 and 2015, driven largely by an increase in the frequency with which high-amplitude ridge-trough wave patterns result in simultaneous severe temperature conditions in both the West and East. Using a large single-model ensemble of climate simulations, we show that the observed positive trend in the warm-West/cool-East events is attributable to historical anthropogenic emissions including greenhouse gases, but that the co-occurrence of extreme western warmth and eastern cold will likely decrease in the future as winter temperatures warm dramatically across the continent, thereby reducing the occurrence of severely cold conditions in the East. Although our analysis is focused on one particular region, our analysis framework is generally transferable to the physical conditions shaping different types of extreme events around the globe.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Seismic moulin tremor](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015JB012786/full)
___

**Abstract**:

*Through glacial moulins, meltwater is routed from the glacier surface to its base. Moulins are a main feature feeding subglacial drainage systems and thus influencing basal motion and ice dynamics, but their geometry remains poorly known. Here we show that analysis of the seismic wavefield generated by water falling into a moulin can help constrain its geometry. We present modeling results of hour-long seimic tremors emitted from a vertical moulin shaft, observed with a seismometer array installed at the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The tremor was triggered when the moulin water level exceeded a certain height, which we associate with the threshold for the waterfall to hit directly the surface of the moulin water column. The amplitude of the tremor signal changed over each tremor episode, in close relation to the amount of inflowing water. The tremor spectrum features multiple prominent peaks, whose characteristic frequencies are distributed like the resonant modes of a semiopen organ pipe and were found to depend on the moulin water level, consistent with a source composed of resonant tube waves (water pressure waves coupled to elastic deformation of the moulin walls) along the water-filled moulin pipe. Analysis of surface particle motions lends further support to this interpretation. The seismic wavefield was modeled as a superposition of sustained wave radiation by pressure sources on the side walls and at the bottom of the moulin. The former was found to dominate the wave field at close distance and the latter at large distance to the moulin.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [European Neolithic societies showed early warning signals of population collapse](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/35/9751.abstract.html)
___

**Significance**:

*This study explores whether archaeologically detectable declines in resilience precede the onset of large-scale human population collapses. Our case study is the European Neolithic: a period that began approximately 9,000 y ago when the introduction of agricultural technologies initiated phases of rapid population growth that were in many cases followed by demographic instability and dramatic collapse. Our study finds evidence that statistical signatures of decreasing resilience can be detected long before population decline begins. To our knowledge, this study is the first to find early warning signals of demographic regime shift among human populations. The results suggest that archaeological information can potentially be used to monitor social and ecological vulnerability in human societies at large spatial and temporal scales.*

**Abstract**:

*Ecosystems on the verge of major reorganizationregime shiftmay exhibit declining resilience, which can be detected using a collection of generic statistical tests known as early warning signals (EWSs). This study explores whether EWSs anticipated human population collapse during the European Neolithic. It analyzes recent reconstructions of European Neolithic (84 kya) population trends that reveal regime shifts from a period of rapid growth following the introduction of agriculture to a period of instability and collapse. We find statistical support for EWSs in advance of population collapse. Seven of nine regional datasets exhibit increasing autocorrelation and variance leading up to collapse, suggesting that these societies began to recover from perturbation more slowly as resilience declined. We derive EWS statistics from a prehistoric population proxy based on summed archaeological radiocarbon date probability densities. We use simulation to validate our methods and show that sampling biases, atmospheric effects, radiocarbon calibration error, and taphonomic processes are unlikely to explain the observed EWS patterns. The implications of these results for understanding the dynamics of Neolithic ecosystems are discussed, and we present a general framework for analyzing societal regime shifts using EWS at large spatial and temporal scales. We suggest that our findings are consistent with an adaptive cycling model that highlights both the vulnerability and resilience of early European populations. We close by discussing the implications of the detection of EWS in human systems for archaeology and sustainability science.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Radiative characteristics of clouds embedded in smoke derived from airborne multiangular measurements](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JD025309/abstract)
___

**Abstract**:

*Clouds in the presence of absorbing aerosols result in their apparent darkening, observed at the top of atmosphere (TOA), which is associated with the radiative effects of aerosol absorption. Owing to the large radiative effect and potential impacts on regional climate, above-cloud aerosols have recently been characterized in multiple satellite-based studies. While satellite data are particularly useful in showing the radiative impact of above-cloud aerosols at the TOA, recent literature indicates large uncertainties in satellite retrievals of above-cloud aerosol optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA), which are among the most important parameters in the assessment of associated radiative effects. In this study, we analyze radiative characteristics of clouds in the presence of wildfire smoke using airborne data primarily from NASA's Cloud Absorption Radiometer, collected during the Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites campaign in Canada during the 2008 summer season. We found a strong positive reflectance (R) gradient in the UV-visible (VIS)-near infrared (NIR) spectrum for clouds embedded in dense smoke, as opposed to an (expected) negative gradient for cloud-free smoke and a flat spectrum for smoke-free cloud cover. Several cases of clouds embedded in thick smoke were found, when the aircraft made circular/spiral measurements, which not only allowed the complete characterization of angular distribution of smoke scattering but also provided the vertical distribution of smoke and clouds (within 0.55km). Specifically, the largest darkening by smoke was found in the UV/VIS, with R0.34m reducing to 0.2 (or 20%), in contrast to 0.8 at NIR wavelengths (e.g., 1.27m). The observed darkening is associated with large AODs (0.53.0) and moderately low SSA (0.850.93 at 0.53m), resulting in a significantly large instantaneous aerosol forcing efficiency of 25447Wm^2 ^1. Our observations of smoke-cloud radiative interactions were found to be physically consistent with theoretical plane-parallel 1-D and Monte Carlo 3-D radiative transfer calculations, capturing the observed gradient across UV-VIS-NIR. Results from this study offer insights into aerosol-cloud radiative interactions and may help in better constraining satellite retrieval algorithms.* </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

During speech processing, human listeners can separately analyze lexical and intonational cues to arrive at a unified representation of communicative content. The evolution of this capacity can be best investigated by comparative studies. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we explored whether and how dog brains segregate and integrate lexical and intonational information. We found a left-hemisphere bias for processing meaningful words, independently of intonation; a right auditory brain region for distinguishing intonationally marked and unmarked words; and increased activity in primary reward regions only when both lexical and intonational information were consistent with praise. Neural mechanisms to separately analyze and integrate word meaning and intonation in dogs suggest that this capacity can evolve in the absence of language. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would actually argue otherwise, and would agree with following statement:

The visualization couldnt be more straightforward: As the years progress, the number and intensity of the red-colored cells increases. Slowly at first, then dramatically from around the 1980s onward. Its useful for presenting a simple message: the world is getting warmer, Hawkins says.

In an instant you can convey precisely that by looking at the figure. It doesn't require sitting through minutes of animation and perhaps losing track of where things started. In the blink of an eye it's clear. Now keep in mind that I'm not saying that animations are bad, or even that these maps are better - but I am saying that there are several methods of looking at the data, and climate trends. This visualization is simply another method of analyzing the trend, which it conveys quite well. 

This would make a great poster. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Representing 3-D cloud radiation effects in two-stream schemes: 1. Longwave considerations and effective cloud edge length](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JD024876/abstract)

**Abstract**:

*Current weather and climate models neglect 3-D radiative transfer through cloud sides, which can change the cloud radiative effect (CRE) significantly. This two-part paper describes the development of the SPeedy Algorithm for Radiative TrAnsfer through CloUd Sides (SPARTACUS) to capture these effects efficiently in a two-stream radiation scheme for use in global models. The present paper concerns the longwave spectral region, where not much work has been done previously, although the limited previous work has suggested that radiative transfer through cloud sides increases the longwave surface CRE of shallow cumulus by around 30%. To assist the development of a longwave capability for SPARTACUS, we use a reference case of an isolated, isothermal, optically thick, cubic cloud in vacuum, for which 3-D effects increase CRE by exactly 200%. It is shown that for any cloud shape, the 3-D effect can be represented in SPARTACUS provided that correct account is made for (1) the effective zenith angle of diffuse radiation emitted from a cloud, (2) the spatial distribution of fluxes in the cloud, (3) cloud clustering that enhances the interception of emitted radiation by neighboring clouds, and (4) radiative smoothing leading to the effective cloud edge length being less than the measured value. We find empirically that the circumference of an ellipse fitted to a horizontal cross section through a cumulus cloud provides a good estimate of the radiatively effective cloud edge length, which provides some guidance to how cloud observations could be analyzed to extract their most important properties for radiation.*

Study: [Representing 3-D cloud radiation effects in two-stream schemes: 2. Matrix formulation and broadband evaluation](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JD024875/abstract)

**Abstract**:

*Estimating the impact of radiation transport through cloud sides on the global energy budget is hampered by the lack of a fast radiation scheme suitable for use in global atmospheric models that can represent these effects in both the shortwave and longwave. This two-part paper describes the development of such a scheme, which we refer to as the Speedy Algorithm for Radiative Transfer through Cloud Sides (SPARTACUS). The principle of the method is to add extra terms to the two-stream equations to represent lateral transport between clear and cloudy regions, which vary in proportion to the length of cloud edge as a function of height. The present paper describes a robust and accurate method for solving the coupled system of equations in both the shortwave and longwave in terms of matrix exponentials. This solver has been coupled to a correlated-k model for gas absorption. We then confirm the accuracy of SPARTACUS by performing broadband comparisons with fully 3-D radiation calculations by the Monte Carlo model MYSTIC for a cumulus cloud field, examining particularly the percentage change in cloud radiative effect (CRE) when 3-D effects are introduced. In the shortwave, SPARTACUS correctly captures this change to CRE, which varies with solar zenith angle between 25% and +120%. In the longwave, SPARTACUS captures well the increase in radiative cooling of the cloud, although it is only able to correctly simulate the 30% increase in surface CRE (around 4 W m2) if an approximate correction is made for cloud clustering.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Particulate air pollution from wildfires in the Western US under climate change](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-016-1762-6)
___

**Abstract**: 

*Wildfire can impose a direct impact on human health under climate change. While the potential impacts of climate change on wildfires and resulting air pollution have been studied, it is not known who will be most affected by the growing threat of wildfires. Identifying communities that will be most affected will inform development of fire management strategies and disaster preparedness programs. We estimate levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) directly attributable to wildfires in 561 western US counties during fire seasons for the present-day (20042009) and future (20462051), using a fire prediction model and GEOS-Chem, a 3-D global chemical transport model. Future estimates are obtained under a scenario of moderately increasing greenhouse gases by mid-century. We create a new term Smoke Wave, defined as 2 consecutive days with high wildfire-specific PM2.5, to describe episodes of high air pollution from wildfires. We develop an interactive map to demonstrate the counties likely to suffer from future high wildfire pollution events. For 20042009, on days exceeding regulatory PM2.5 standards, wildfires contributed an average of 71.3 % of total PM2.5. Under future climate change, we estimate that more than 82 million individuals will experience a 57 % and 31 % increase in the frequency and intensity, respectively, of Smoke Waves. Northern California, Western Oregon and the Great Plains are likely to suffer the highest exposure to widlfire smoke in the future. Results point to the potential health impacts of increasing wildfire activity on large numbers of people in a warming climate and the need to establish or modify US wildfire management and evacuation programs in high-risk regions. The study also adds to the growing literature arguing that extreme events in a changing climate could have significant consequences for human health.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Carbon balance effects of U.S. biofuel production and use](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-016-1764-4)
___

**Abstract**:

*The use of liquid biofuels has expanded over the past decade in response to policies such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) that promote their use for transportation. One rationale is the belief that biofuels are inherently carbon neutral, meaning that only production-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions need to be tallied when comparing them to fossil fuels. This assumption is embedded in the lifecycle analysis (LCA) modeling used to justify and administer such policies. LCA studies have often found that crop-based biofuels such as corn ethanol and biodiesel offer at least modest net GHG reductions relative to petroleum fuels. Data over the period of RFS expansion enable empirical assessment of net CO2 emission effects. This analysis evaluates the direct carbon exchanges (both emissions and uptake) between the atmosphere and the U.S. vehicle-fuel system (motor vehicles and the physical supply chain for motor fuels) over 20052013. While U.S. biofuel use rose from 0.37 to 1.34 EJ/yr over this period, additional carbon uptake on cropland was enough to offset only 37 % of the biofuel-related biogenic CO2 emissions. This result falsifies the assumption of a full offset made by LCA and other GHG accounting methods that assume biofuel carbon neutrality. Once estimates from the literature for process emissions and displacement effects including land-use change are considered, the conclusion is that U.S. biofuel use to date is associated with a net increase rather than a net decrease in CO2 emissions.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Editors note: Earlier today we accidentally broke the embargo on a new study, "Neural mechanisms for lexical processing in dogs," led by A. Andics and published in Science. The mistake was due to miscommunication about dates on our publishing calendar, and we're reviewing how we track embargoes internally.

The embargo system for science publishing allows journalists worldwide to spend concerted effort in covering new research, which is essential for accuracy in science reporting. As such, by breaking this embargo we've put major strain on journalists hoping to cover the new study, which in turns means the researchers may have less coverage of their work than they hoped for. This helps no one, and we apologize sincerely for the error.

<TEXT> Study (open access): [El Nio and coral larval dispersal across the eastern Pacific marine barrier](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12571)
___

**Abstract**:

More than 5,000 km separates the frequently disturbed coral reefs of the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) from western sources of population replenishment. It has been hypothesized that El Nio events facilitate eastward dispersal across this East Pacific Barrier (EPB). Here we present a biophysical coral larval dispersal model driven by 14.5 years of high-resolution surface ocean current data including the extreme 19971998 El Nio. We find no eastward cross-EPB connections over this period, which implies that ETP coral populations decimated by the 1998 bleaching event can only have recovered from eastern Pacific sources, in congruence with genetic data. Instead, rare connections between eastern and central Pacific reefs are simulated in a westward direction. Significant complexity and variability in the surface flows transporting larvae mean that generalized upper-ocean circulation patterns are poor descriptors of inter-regional connectivity, complicating the assessment of how climate change will impact coral gene flow Pacific wide. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [The suppression of Antarctic bottom water formation by melting ice shelves in Prydz Bay](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12577)
___

**Abstract**:

A fourth production region for the globally important Antarctic bottom water has been attributed to dense shelf water formation in the Cape Darnley Polynya, adjoining Prydz Bay in East Antarctica. Here we show new observations from CTD-instrumented elephant seals in 20112013 that provide the first complete assessment of dense shelf water formation in Prydz Bay. After a complex evolution involving opposing contributions from three polynyas (positive) and two ice shelves (negative), dense shelf water (salinity 34.6534.7) is exported through Prydz Channel. This provides a distinct, relatively fresh contribution to Cape Darnley bottom water. Elsewhere, dense water formation is hindered by the freshwater input from the Amery and West Ice Shelves into the Prydz Bay Gyre. This study highlights the susceptibility of Antarctic bottom water to increased freshwater input from the enhanced melting of ice shelves, and ultimately the potential collapse of Antarctic bottom water formation in a warming climate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Heterogeneous reduction of carbon dioxide by hydride-terminated silicon nanocrystals](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12553)
___

**Abstract**:

Silicon constitutes 28% of the earths mass. Its high abundance, lack of toxicity and low cost coupled with its electrical and optical properties, make silicon unique among the semiconductors for converting sunlight into electricity. In the quest for semiconductors that can make chemicals and fuels from sunlight and carbon dioxide, unfortunately the best performers are invariably made from rare and expensive elements. Here we report the observation that hydride-terminated silicon nanocrystals with average diameter 3.5 nm, denoted ncSi:H, can function as a single component heterogeneous reducing agent for converting gaseous carbon dioxide selectively to carbon monoxide, at a rate of hundreds of mol h^1  g^1. The large surface area, broadband visible to near infrared light harvesting and reducing power of SiH surface sites of ncSi:H, together play key roles in this conversion. Making use of the reducing power of nanostructured hydrides towards gaseous carbon dioxide is a conceptually distinct and commercially interesting strategy for making fuels directly from sunlight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Climate Change and Future Pollen Allergy in Europe](http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/EHP173/)
___

**Abstract**:

**Background**: *Globally pollen allergy is a major public health problem, but a fundamental unknown is the likely impact of climate change. To our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the consequences of climate change upon pollen allergy in humans.*

**Objectives**: *To produce quantitative estimates of the potential impact of climate change upon pollen allergy in humans, focusing upon common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) in Europe.*

**Methods**: *A process-based model estimated the change in ragweeds range under climate change. A second model simulated current and future ragweed pollen levels. These were translated into health burdens using a dose-response curve generated from a systematic review and current and future population data. Models considered two different suites of regional climate/pollen models, two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (RCP4.5 and 8.5), and three different plant invasion scenarios.*

**Results**: *Our primary estimates indicate that sensitization to ragweed will more than double in Europe, from 33 to 77 million people, by 2041-2060. According to our projections, while sensitization will increase in countries with an existing ragweed problem (e.g. Hungary, the Balkans), the greatest proportional increases will occur where sensitization is uncommon (e.g. Germany, Poland, France). Higher pollen concentrations and a longer pollen season may also increase the severity of symptoms. Our model projections are driven predominantly by changes in climate (66%), but also are influenced by current trends in the spread of this invasive plant species. Assumptions about the rate at which ragweed spreads throughout Europe have a large influence upon the results.*

**Conclusions**: *Our quantitative estimates indicate that ragweed pollen allergy will become a common health problem across Europe, expanding into areas where it is currently uncommon. Control of ragweed spread may be an important adaptation strategy in response to climate change.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> During the early formation of the solar system Jupiter in no way protected the inner planets. The migration of the gas planets (see: [Nice Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_model)) is what lead to the [Late Heavy Bombardment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment). Water, is largely attributed to asteroids (not comets) and the Earth itself (ie. [it was always here](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6209/623) since the formation of the planet and was not delivered later on). These are the most strongly supported arguments currently accepted by the majority of the scientific community.

Basic celestial mechanics tells us that the early solar system, *any* early solar system, will be chaotic - by definition then Jupiter like planets cannot 'protect' terrestrial planets, or any others for that matter. Any migration of planetesimals and planets will perturb the orbits of surrounding bodies until new orbital resonances are configured and stabilized.

I would also add that ... the possibility that a moon heated by tidal forces orbiting around a gas giant beyond the ice line might also be an additional habitat for potential life.

I think that's about the only thing I you've said that I would agree with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We have a sample size of one when it comes to solar systems with life. 

Physics and chemistry don't suddenly start operating differently once you step off of planet Earth. I understand what you're getting at but I'm solely focusing on correcting your improper statement with regard to Jupiter acting as a 'protector.'

Of course having a Jupiter has pros and cons. Even the article you cite comes to that conclusion.

That doesn't change the fact that Jupiter sends *more* material towards Earth. Pros, it stops the occasional comet from reaching the inner planets. Cons, it continuously perturbs the orbit of the asteroids and sends a shit ton of debris towards the inner planets. Stating that there are pros and cons without weighing the pros and cons is dismissive of the net effect. The article clearly states:

"It definitely sends asteroids and comets our way and, in any given year, more than 90 percent of all objects crossing Earths orbit are asteroids, so the protection Jupiter provides us from long period comets, or by eventually removing short period comets, is of lesser importance. Hence Jupiter is not the friend that it has been perceived to be" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Early onset of industrial-era warming across the oceans and continents](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v536/n7617/full/nature19082.html)
___

**Abstract**:

*The evolution of industrial-era warming across the continents and oceans provides a context for future climate change and is important for determining climate sensitivity and the processes that control regional warming. Here we use post-ad 1500 palaeoclimate records to show that sustained industrial-era warming of the tropical oceans first developed during the mid-nineteenth century and was nearly synchronous with Northern Hemisphere continental warming. The early onset of sustained, significant warming in palaeoclimate records and model simulations suggests that greenhouse forcing of industrial-era warming commenced as early as the mid-nineteenth century and included an enhanced equatorial ocean response mechanism. The development of Southern Hemisphere warming is delayed in reconstructions, but this apparent delay is not reproduced in climate simulations. Our findings imply that instrumental records are too short to comprehensively assess anthropogenic climate change and that, in some regions, about 180 years of industrial-era warming has already caused surface temperatures to emerge above pre-industrial values, even when taking natural variability into account.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> The article's underlying assumption (the crux of any argument) is for a large investment and rapid expansion of renewables or near-zero carbon technologies (NZCT) if attempts to reduce global emissions are to be adopted. On the other hand, should little be done to reduce emissions then emissions are likely to see a continued increase even when switching from coal to natural gas as you've pointed out, but is also pointed out in Hausfather's paper from which his article is based on: [Bounding the climate viability of natural gas as a bridge fuel to displace coal](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421515300239), which is illustrated in [here](https://i.imgur.com/VTwS5DA.png). 

...that means cheap natural gas is not just replacing coal, but solar and wind, too...

Hausfather briefly touches on this in the article stating, "*But if we end up locking in gas infrastructure that sticks around and delays renewables, we might be better off eschewing a gas bridge even if it means sticking around with coal a bit longer.*"

I have yet to read the paper you've linked in full, but it would be interesting to see how well the models account for climate policy, for example COP21 (taking place over a year after the papers publishing). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Decadal variability of tropical tropopause temperature and its relationship to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep29537)
___

**Abstract**:

*Tropopause temperatures (TPTs) control the amount of stratospheric water vapour, which influences chemistry, radiation and circulation in the stratosphere, and is also an important driver of surface climate. Decadal variability and long-term trends in tropical TPTs as well as stratospheric water vapour are largely unknown. Here, we present for the first time evidence, from reanalysis and state-of-the-art climate model simulations, of a link between decadal variability in tropical TPTs and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The negative phase of the PDO is associated with anomalously cold sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical east and central Pacific, which enhance the zonal SST gradient across the equatorial Pacific. The latter drives a stronger Walker Circulation and a weaker Hadley Circulation, which leads to less convection and subsequently a warmer tropopause over the central equatorial Pacific. Over the North Pacific, positive sea level pressure anomalies occur, which damp vertical wave propagation into the stratosphere. This in turn slows the Brewer-Dobson circulation, and hence warms the tropical tropopause, enabling more water vapour to enter the stratosphere. The reverse chain of events holds for the positive phase of the PDO. Such ocean-troposphere-stratosphere interactions may provide an important feedback on the Earths global surface temperature.* </TEXT>

___

**Policy relevance**:

*This article highlights the significance of non-market forces in shaping the EUs energy markets. It finds that intensities of national commitment to nuclear power tend to be inversely related to degrees of success in achieving EU climate policy goals. While the nuclear sector is increasingly economically uncompetitive and appears to be in decline for the EU as a whole, an abiding political challenge remains one of increasing interests and incentives in popular participation and interest in energy systems management.*

**Abstract**:

*Since its initial adoption, the EUs 2020 Strategy  to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, increase the share of renewable energy to at least 20% of consumption, and achieve energy savings of 20% or more by 2020  has witnessed substantial albeit uneven progress. This article addresses the question of what role nuclear power generation has played, and can or should play in future, towards attaining the EU 2020 Strategy, particularly with reference to decreasing emissions and increasing renewables. It also explores the persistent diversity in energy strategies among member states. To do so, it first surveys the current landscape of nuclear energy use and then presents the interrelated concepts of path dependency, momentum, and lock-in. The article proceeds to examine five factors that help explain national nuclear divergence: technological capacity and consumption; economic cost; security and materiality; national perceptions; and political, ideological and institutional factors. This divergence reveals a more general weakness in the 2020 Strategys underlying assumptions. Although energy security  defined as energy availability, reliability, affordability, and sustainability  remains a vital concern for all member states, the 2020 Strategy does not explicitly address questions of political participation, control, and power. The inverse relationship identified here  between intensity of nuclear commitments, and emissions mitigation and uptake of renewable sources  underscores the importance of increasing citizens' levels of energy policy awareness and participation in policy design.* </TEXT>

Recent assessments agree that tropical cyclone intensity should increase as the climate warms. Less agreement exists on the detection of recent historical trends in tropical cyclone intensity. We interpret future and recent historical trends by using the theory of potential intensity, which predicts the maximum intensity achievable by a tropical cyclone in a given local environment. Although greenhouse gasdriven warming increases potential intensity, climate model simulations suggest that aerosol cooling has largely canceled that effect over the historical record. Large natural variability complicates analysis of trends, as do poleward shifts in the latitude of maximum intensity. In the absence of strong reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, future greenhouse gas forcing of potential intensity will increasingly dominate over aerosol forcing, leading to substantially larger increases in tropical cyclone intensities. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Supraglacial lakes are known to influence ice melt and ice flow on the Greenland ice sheet and potentially cause ice shelf disintegration on the Antarctic Peninsula. In East Antarctica, however, our understanding of their behaviour and impact is more limited. Using 150 optical satellite images and meteorological records from 2000-2013, we provide the first multi-year analysis of lake evolution on Langhovde Glacier, Dronning Maud Land (6911'S, 3932'E). We observe 7,990 lakes and 855 surface channels up to 18.1 km inland (~ 670 m a.s.l.) from the grounding line, and document three pathways of lake demise: (i) refreezing, (ii) drainage to the en-/sub-glacial environment (on the floating ice), and (iii) overflow into surface channels (on both the floating and grounded ice). The parallels between these mechanisms, and those observed on Greenland/the Antarctic Peninsula, suggest that lakes may similarly affect rates and patterns of ice melt, ice flow and ice shelf disintegration in East Antarctica. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Spatially governed climate factors dominate management in determining the quantity and distribution of soil organic carbon in dryland agricultural systems](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep31468)
___

**Abstract**:

Few studies describe the primary drivers influencing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and the distribution of carbon (C) fractions in agricultural systems from semi-arid regions; yet these soils comprise one fifth of the global land area. Here we identified the primary drivers for changes in total SOC and associated particulate (POC), humus (HOC) and resistant (ROC) organic C fractions for 1347 sample points in the semi-arid agricultural region of Western Australia. Total SOC stock (00.3m) varied from 4 to 209t C ha^1 with 79% of variation explained by measured variables. The proportion of C in POC, HOC and ROC fractions averaged 28%, 45% and 27% respectively. Climate (43%) and land management practices (32%) had the largest relative influence on variation in total SOC. Carbon accumulation was constrained where average daily temperature was above 17.2C and annual rainfall below 450mm, representing approximately 42% of the 197,300km2 agricultural region. As such large proportions of this region are not suited to C sequestration strategies. For the remainder of the region a strong influence of management practices on SOC indicate opportunities for C sequestration strategies associated with incorporation of longer pasture phases and adequate fertilisation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Ensemble projections of wildfire activity and carbonaceous aerosol concentrations over the western United States in the mid-21st century](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231013004573)
___

Highlights

 We apply ensemble projection for future wildfire using output from 15 GCMs.

 We develop and evaluate both regressions and a parameterization for fire predictions.

 We investigate the impacts of climate change on fuel load by the midcentury.

 We examine fire-induced changes in OC/BC by the midcentury.

**Abstract**:

We estimate future wildfire activity over the western United States during the mid-21st century (20462065), based on results from 15 climate models following the A1B scenario. We develop fire prediction models by regressing meteorological variables from the current and previous years together with fire indexes onto observed regional area burned. The regressions explain 0.250.60 of the variance in observed annual area burned during 19802004, depending on the ecoregion. We also parameterize daily area burned with temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity. This approach explains 0.5 of the variance in observed area burned over forest ecoregions but shows no predictive capability in the semi-arid regions of Nevada and California. By applying the meteorological fields from 15 climate models to our fire prediction models, we quantify the robustness of our wildfire projections at midcentury. We calculate increases of 24124% in area burned using regressions and 63169% with the parameterization. Our projections are most robust in the southwestern desert, where all GCMs predict significant (p  0.05) meteorological changes. For forested ecoregions, more GCMs predict significant increases in future area burned with the parameterization than with the regressions, because the latter approach is sensitive to hydrological variables that show large inter-model variability in the climate projections. The parameterization predicts that the fire season lengthens by 23 days in the warmer and drier climate at midcentury. Using a chemical transport model, we find that wildfire emissions will increase summertime surface organic carbon aerosol over the western United States by 4670% and black carbon by 2027% at midcentury, relative to the present day. The pollution is most enhanced during extreme episodes: above the 84th percentile of concentrations, OC increases by 90% and BC by 50%, while visibility decreases from 130 km to 100 km in 32 Federal Class 1 areas in Rocky Mountains Forest.

___

**Abstract**:

During 19982012, climate change and sea level rise (SLR) exhibit two notable features: a slowdown of global surface warming (hiatus) and a rapid SLR in the tropical western Pacific. To quantify their relationship, we analyze the long-term control simulations of 38 climate models. We find a significant and robust correlation between the east-west contrast of dynamic sea level (DSL) in the Pacific and global mean surface temperature (GST) variability on both interannual and decadal time scales. Based on linear regression of the multimodel ensemble mean, the anomalously fast SLR in the western tropical Pacific observed during 19982012 indicates suppression of a potential global surface warming of 0.16  0.06C. In contrast, the Pacific contributed 0.29  0.10C to the significant interannual GST increase in 1997/1998. The Pacific DSL anomalies observed in 2015 suggest that the strong El Nio in 2015/2016 could lead to a 0.21  0.07C GST jump. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

*Clouds are crucial for Earths climate and radiation budget. Great attention has been paid to low, high and vertically thick tropospheric clouds such as stratus, cirrus and deep convective clouds. However, much less is known about tropospheric mid-level clouds as these clouds are challenging to observe in situ and difficult to detect by remote sensing techniques. Here we use Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) satellite observations to show that thin mid-level clouds (TMLCs) are ubiquitous in the tropics. Supported by high-resolution regional model simulations, we find that TMLCs are formed by detrainment from convective clouds near the zero-degree isotherm. Calculations using a radiative transfer model indicate that tropical TMLCs have a cooling effect on climate that could be as large in magnitude as the warming effect of cirrus. We conclude that more effort has to be made to understand TMLCs, as their influence on cloud feedbacks, heat and moisture transport, and climate sensitivity could be substantial.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Comment by /u/nimbuscile ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/4ybp2t/thin_clouds_at_about_5_km_altitude_are_more/d6mmdpq)) 

I'm going to jump in here before the comment section gets too busy.

**This does not mean climate models are projecting too much global warming.**

This research used observations of clouds from a relatively-new satellite instrument that allows us to observe clouds that are very thin. Very thin clouds aren't represented in global climate models because they divide the atmosphere into boxes that are typically 100 km across and about 600 m deep at the relevant altitudes.

The study then uses a regional model with much higher resolution model (1 km in the horizontal, 325 m in the vertical) to simulate the formation of these clouds. This allows us to resolve the small-scale processes required. Although this model was informative in understanding how such clouds can form, the authors found discrepancies between the high-resolution simulation and the observations. This suggests the process generating these clouds is too weak in the model.

The authors then calculated the effect of the these clouds on the Earth, based on the satellite observations. They showed the effect is rather larger than expected, giving a cooling effect of -0.9 to -0.3 Wm-2 in the tropics. To put this into perspective, we know that clouds as a whole have a cooling effect of -20 Wm-2 in the same region, so these thin clouds represent 1.5 to 4.5 % of the entire effect.

My summary of the research would be as follows:

- Our observational capabilities are increasing and allowing us to probe the Earth's atmosphere in more detail.

- These observations allow us to test our understanding of the processes behind cloud formation.

- Thin cloud layers appear to be more common than we expected. Their overall effect on Earth's temperature is to cool it slightly.

We need to think harder to understand exactly how these thin cloud layers form because numerical simulations of them typically generate too few of them.

**What does this mean for climate models?**

There are many effects climate models are unable to capture. By definition global climate models cannot simulate small-scale processes as we lack the computational resources. We run climate models because they allows us to understand the limits of our knowledge, not because we think they perform identically to the real world. They are useful tools and not the be-all and end-all of climate science. Any professional climate scientist knows this.

**What does this mean for global warming projections?**

It's difficult to say. Clouds in general have a cooling effect on climate (though there are exceptions). If they become less common under global warming this means warming will be enhanced (a positive feedback) since the cooling effect will be weakened. If they become more common warming will be weaker (a negative feedback).

From the conclusions of the study:

In a context of a global warming of 2 K, a perturbed high-resolution model simulation indicates that the morphological properties of TMLCs [thin mid-level clouds], as well as their cloud water content, and thus their OD, remain similar. However, it is difficult to say how TMLCs would change in a changing climate as not even the high-resolution model is able to accurately represent them. The cloud feedback and cloud adjustment to increasing CO2 would likely change the physical and optical properties of clouds at different levels, affecting the properties and radiative effect of TMLCs. Fewer, higher and thicker clouds are simulated to form in a warmer climate. Moreover, their albedo may decrease in the tropics due to the cloud adjustment to increasing CO2. On the one hand, thicker TMLCs and a decrease of low-level cloud albedo will likely induce a more negative radiative effect. On the other hand, fewer clouds and an increase in surface albedo, for example, due to deforestation, will lead to a less negative radiative effect. Changes in the intensity and distribution of deep convection in a warmer climate may also directly affect the TMLC formation process and spatial distribution. All in all, a proper representation of TMLC formation in global climate models is needed to draw more firm conclusions on how the radiative effect of TMLCs would be affected in a warming climate. Our results suggest that further studies on TMLCs are needed to better understand their life cycle and physical properties, to represent them accurately in models, and to fully explore their radiative effects and overall impact on climate.

I'm happy to help with interpretation of this paragraph if people would find it useful.

<TEXT> Another recent study concludes that there is a low potential for negative effects on bee behavior or colony health from neonicotinoid pesticides. 

Study: [Survey and Risk Assessment of Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Exposure to Neonicotinoid Pesticides in Urban, Rural, and Agricultural Settings](http://jee.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/01/19/jee.tov397)
___

**Abstract**:

A comparative assessment of apiaries in urban, rural, and agricultural areas was undertaken in 2013 and 2014 to examine potential honey bee colony exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides from pollen foraging. Apiaries ranged in size from one to hundreds of honey bee colonies, and included those operated by commercial, sideline (semicommercial), and hobbyist beekeepers. Residues in and on wax and beebread (stored pollen in the hive) were evaluated for the nitro-substituted neonicotinoid insecticides imidacloprid and its olefin metabolite and the active ingredients clothianidin, thiamethoxam, and dinotefuran. Beebread and comb wax collected from hives in agricultural landscapes were more likely to have detectable residues of thiamethoxam and clothianidin than that collected from hives in rural or urban areas (50% of samples vs. 10%). The maximum neonicotinoid residue detected in either wax or beebread was 3.9 ppb imidacloprid. A probabilistic risk assessment was conducted on the residues recovered from beebread in apiaries located in commercial, urban, and rural landscapes. The calculated risk quotient based on a dietary no observable adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) suggested low potential for negative effects on bee behavior or colony health. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Wild bee declines have been ascribed in part to neonicotinoid insecticides. While short-term laboratory studies on commercially bred species (principally honeybees and bumblebees) have identified sub-lethal effects, there is no strong evidence linking these insecticides to losses of the majority of wild bee species. We relate 18 years of UK national wild bee distribution data for 62 species to amounts of neonicotinoid use in oilseed rape. Using a multi-species dynamic Bayesian occupancy analysis, we find evidence of increased population extinction rates in response to neonicotinoid seed treatment use on oilseed rape. Species foraging on oilseed rape benefit from the cover of this crop, but were on average three times more negatively affected by exposure to neonicotinoids than non-crop foragers. Our results suggest that sub-lethal effects of neonicotinoids could scale up to cause losses of bee biodiversity. Restrictions on neonicotinoid use may reduce population declines. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Dr. Laken, 

Firstly, thank you for time - it's greatly appreciated, and secondly I apologize for the low user activity (it's a small subreddit, but growing). Hopefully others will chime in with their questions in time.

The paper was certainly interesting, and it did raise a number of questions. I apologize for any degree of ignorance as a good portion of the paper is outside the scope of my degree. 
___

Questions:

(1) What lead to exclusion of other climatic phenomena such as the Arctic Oscillation (AO), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in your analysis?

(2) I didn't see where the AOD data was coming from. I was interested in the specifics of this data set as it relates to, assumingly, volcanic injection of stratospheric aerosols (is this data set cross referenced with known ash layers for major eruptions, etc.?)

(3) For the sake of clarity, is there a table summarizing the effectiveness of WSDs as influenced by ENSO, NAO, SC, and AOD depending on the boreal winter / summer? If not, do you think this could be a beneficial tool for visualizing the results of the paper by color coding their relative strength?

(4) Discussion in paper suggests no significant affects from SC to the NAO... and although you discuss possible causes for the discrepancy between your findings and other published studies, there appears to be a good degree of uncertainty for the discrepancy. In the future, what analytical methods do you see helping to clear up this discrepancy?

(5) In particular one of the statements made in the study peaked my interest:

"*...it is highly problematic to disambiguate the forcing effects of internal variations in the climate system, such as volcanic eruptions or ENSO, which operate over timescales comparable to solar variability*..." 

I am not aware of timescale comparisons between volcanic activity and solar variability and the references provided
16   18 are not related to volcanic activity. Perhaps I am misinterpreting the statement, but it seems to be implying some sort of cyclic timescale on which volcanic activity may increase and decrease that is comparable to solar variability. If my interpretation is correct, do you feel such a statement is warranted given - what I believe to be - a lack of evidence for such timescales relating to volcanic activity?

(6) Could your methodology be applied/adapted to a recent paper suggesting that Mt. Pinatubo suppressed an  acceleration signal of SLR? (See: [Is the detection of accelerated sea level rise imminent?](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep31245)) Have you looked at applying/adapting your studies method to other earth system phenomena?

(7) Is it possible to extend this studies methods further back without the use the HBGWL?

Thanks again for your time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Antarctic last interglacial isotope peak in response to sea ice retreat not ice-sheet collapse](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160816/ncomms12293/full/ncomms12293.html)
___

**Abstract**:

Several studies have suggested that sea-level rise during the last interglacial implies retreat of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). The prevalent hypothesis is that the retreat coincided with the peak Antarctic temperature and stable water isotope values from 128,000 years ago (128ka); very early in the last interglacial. Here, by analysing climate model simulations of last interglacial WAIS loss featuring water isotopes, we show instead that the isotopic response to WAIS loss is in opposition to the isotopic evidence at 128ka. Instead, a reduction in winter sea ice area of 657% fully explains the 128ka ice core evidence. Our finding of a marked retreat of the sea ice at 128ka demonstrates the sensitivity of Antarctic sea ice extent to climate warming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Earliest land plants created modern levels of atmospheric oxygen](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/08/10/1604787113)
___

**Significance**:

*The rise of atmospheric oxygen over Earths history has received much recent interdisciplinary attention. However, the puzzle of when and how atmospheric oxygen reached modern levels remains unresolved. Many recent studies have argued for a major oxygenation eventof uncertain causein the Neoproterozoic Era 541 Ma, enabling the rise of animals. Previous modelling work has predicted a late Paleozoic oxygen rise (380 Ma) due to the rise of forests. Here we show that neither scenario is correct. Instead, the earliest plants, which colonized the land from 470 Ma onward, first increased atmospheric oxygen to present levels by 400 Ma, and this instigated fire-mediated feedbacks that have stabilized high oxygen levels ever since, shaping subsequent evolution.*

**Abstract**:

*The progressive oxygenation of the Earths atmosphere was pivotal to the evolution of life, but the puzzle of when and how atmospheric oxygen (O2) first approached modern levels (21%) remains unresolved. Redox proxy data indicate the deep oceans were oxygenated during 435392 Ma, and the appearance of fossil charcoal indicates O2 1517% by 420400 Ma. However, existing models have failed to predict oxygenation at this time. Here we show that the earliest plants, which colonized the land surface from 470 Ma onward, were responsible for this mid-Paleozoic oxygenation event, through greatly increasing global organic carbon burialthe net long-term source of O2. We use a trait-based ecophysiological model to predict that cryptogamic vegetation cover could have achieved 30% of todays global terrestrial net primary productivity by 445 Ma. Data from modern bryophytes suggests this plentiful early plant material had a much higher molar C:P ratio (2,000) than marine biomass (100), such that a given weathering flux of phosphorus could support more organic carbon burial. Furthermore, recent experiments suggest that early plants selectively increased the flux of phosphorus (relative to alkalinity) weathered from rocks. Combining these effects in a model of long-term biogeochemical cycling, we reproduce a sustained +2 increase in the carbonate carbon isotope (13C) record by 445 Ma, and predict a corresponding rise in O2 to present levels by 420400 Ma, consistent with geochemical data. This oxygen rise represents a permanent shift in regulatory regime to one where fire-mediated negative feedbacks stabilize high O2 levels.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Airborne methane remote measurements reveal heavy-tail flux distribution in Four Corners region](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/08/10/1605617113)
___

**Significance**:

Fugitive methane emissions are thought to often exhibit a heavy-tail distribution (more high-emission sources than expected in a normal distribution), and thus efficient mitigation is possible if we locate the strongest emitters. Here we demonstrate airborne remote measurements of methane plumes at 1- to 3-m ground resolution over the Four Corners region. We identified more than 250 point sources, whose emissions followed a lognormal distribution, a heavy-tail characteristic. The top 10% of emitters explain about half of the total observed point source contribution and 1/4 the total basin emissions. This work demonstrates the capability of real-time airborne imaging spectroscopy to perform detection and categorization of methane point sources in extended geographical areas with immediate input for emissions abatement.

**Abstract**:


Methane (CH4) impacts climate as the second strongest anthropogenic greenhouse gas and air quality by influencing tropospheric ozone levels. Space-based observations have identified the Four Corners region in the Southwest United States as an area of large CH4 enhancements. We conducted an airborne campaign in Four Corners during April 2015 with the next-generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (near-infrared) and Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (thermal infrared) imaging spectrometers to better understand the source of methane by measuring methane plumes at 1- to 3-m spatial resolution. Our analysis detected more than 250 individual methane plumes from fossil fuel harvesting, processing, and distributing infrastructures, spanning an emission range from the detection limit mml:mathmml:mo\/mml:mo\/mml:math 2 kg/h to 5 kg/h through mml:mathmml:mo\/mml:mo\/mml:math 5,000 kg/h. Observed sources include gas processing facilities, storage tanks, pipeline leaks, and well pads, as well as a coal mine venting shaft. Overall, plume enhancements and inferred fluxes follow a lognormal distribution, with the top 10% emitters contributing 49 to 66% to the inferred total point source flux of 0.23 Tg/y to 0.39 Tg/y. With the observed confirmation of a lognormal emission distribution, this airborne observing strategy and its ability to locate previously unknown point sources in real time provides an efficient and effective method to identify and mitigate major emissions contributors over a wide geographic area. With improved instrumentation, this capability scales to spaceborne applications [Thompson DR, et al. (2016) Geophys Res Lett 43(12):65716578]. Further illustration of this potential is demonstrated with two detected, confirmed, and repaired pipeline leaks during the campaign.

___

**Abstract**:

Electric vehicles can contribute to climate change mitigation if coupled with decarbonized electricity, but only if vehicle range matches travellers needs. Evaluating electric vehicle range against a populations needs is challenging because detailed driving behaviour must be taken into account. Here we develop a model to combine information from coarse-grained but expansive travel surveys with high-resolution GPS data to estimate the energy requirements of personal vehicle trips across the US. We find that the energy requirements of 87% of vehicle-days could be met by an existing, affordable electric vehicle. This percentage is markedly similar across diverse cities, even when per capita gasoline consumption differs significantly. We also find that for the highest-energy days, other vehicle technologies are likely to be needed even as batteries improve and charging infrastructure expands. Car sharing or other means to serve this small number of high-energy days could play an important role in the electrification and decarbonization of transportation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Amplification of RNA by an RNA polymerase ribozyme](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/08/10/1610103113)
___

**Significance**:

Darwinian life requires the ability to replicate genotypes and express phenotypes. Although all extant life relies on protein enzymes to accomplish these tasks, life in the ancestral RNA world would have used only RNA enzymes. Here, we report the in vitro evolution of an improved RNA polymerase ribozyme that is able to synthesize structured functional RNAs, including aptamers and ribozymes, and replicate short RNA sequences in a protein-free form of the PCR. Thus, the replication of RNA and the expression of functional RNA can be accomplished with RNA alone. Combining and improving these activities may enable the self-sustained evolution of RNA and offers a potential route to a synthetic form of RNA life.

**Abstract**:

In all extant life, genetic information is stored in nucleic acids that are replicated by polymerase proteins. In the hypothesized RNA world, before the evolution of genetically encoded proteins, ancestral organisms contained RNA genes that were replicated by an RNA polymerase ribozyme. In an effort toward reconstructing RNA-based life in the laboratory, in vitro evolution was used to improve dramatically the activity and generality of an RNA polymerase ribozyme by selecting variants that can synthesize functional RNA molecules from an RNA template. The improved polymerase ribozyme is able to synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even tRNA. Furthermore, the polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR. Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian lifethe replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional moleculescan now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins.

Yes, they are (under the context in which they imply) - and no they aren't (there are a number of reasons provided as to why contrails may be lasting longer). This was discussed in the paper. If you're interested in the discussion the article is open source and freely available to read in full. 

Furthermore, as contrails are essentially clouds they can evolve and be indistinguishable from cirrus, and cirrostratus clouds. For example: [Young   Old contrail](https://i.imgur.com/NzBp3Qe.jpg) and [cirrus clouds - former contrails](https://i.imgur.com/swnVU8f.jpg). </TEXT>

The experiments included a wide array of studies, involving things like ...  deliberately releasing radioactive chemicals over U.S. and Canadian cities... amongst other things.

___


**Abstract**:

Present-day Venus is an inhospitable place with surface temperatures approaching 750 K and an atmosphere 90 times as thick as Earth's. Billions of years ago the picture may have been very different. We have created a suite of 3-D climate simulations using topographic data from the Magellan mission, solar spectral irradiance estimates for 2.9 and 0.715 Gya, present-day Venus orbital parameters, an ocean volume consistent with current theory, and an atmospheric composition estimated for early Venus. Using these parameters we find that such a world could have had moderate temperatures if Venus had a rotation period slower than ~16 Earth days, despite an incident solar flux 46  70% higher than Earth receives. At its current rotation period, Venus's climate could have remained habitable until at least 715 million years ago. These results demonstrate the role rotation and topography play in understanding the climatic history of Venus-like exoplanets discovered in the present epoch. </TEXT>

Using these parameters we find that such a world could have had moderate temperatures if Venus had a rotation period slower than ~16 Earth days, despite an incident solar flux 4670% higher than Earth receives. At its current rotation period, Venus's climate could have remained habitable until at least 715 million years ago. These results demonstrate the role rotation and topography play in understanding the climatic history of Venus-like exoplanets discovered in the present epoch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [The challenge of climate-change neoskepticism](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6300/653)
___

**Summary**:

Opponents of policies to limit anthropogenic climate change (ACC) have offered a changing set of argumentsdenying or questioning ACC's existence, magnitude, and rate of progress, the risks it presents, the integrity of climate scientists, and the value of mitigation efforts (1). Similar arguments have characterized environmental risk debates concerning arsenical insecticides in the late 1800s (2), phosphates in detergents in the 1960s (3), and the pesticide DDT in the 1960s and '70s (4). Typically, defenders of business as usual first question the scientific evidence that risks exist; then, they question the magnitude of the risks and assert that reducing them has more costs than benefits. A parallel rhetorical shift away from outright skepticism (57) led us to identify neoskepticism as a new incarnation of opposition to major efforts to limit ACC (8). This shift heightens the need for science to inform decision making under uncertainty and to improve communication and education. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Nearly 17% of people in an international survey said they believed the existence of a secret large-scale atmospheric program (SLAP) to be true or partly true. SLAP is commonly referred to as 'chemtrails' or 'covert geoengineering', and has led to a number of websites purported to show evidence of widespread chemical spraying linked to negative impacts on human health and the environment. To address these claims, we surveyed two groups of expertsatmospheric chemists with expertize in condensation trails and geochemists working on atmospheric deposition of dust and pollutionto scientifically evaluate for the first time the claims of SLAP theorists. Results show that 76 of the 77 scientists (98.7%) that took part in this study said they had not encountered evidence of a SLAP, and that the data cited as evidence could be explained through other factors, including well-understood physics and chemistry associated with aircraft contrails and atmospheric aerosols. Our goal is not to sway those already convinced that there is a secret, large-scale spraying programwho often reject counter-evidence as further proof of their theoriesbut rather to establish a source of objective science that can inform public discourse. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Although coal remains the largest source of electricity in the U.S., a combination of factors is driving a decrease in profitability and employment in the coal-sector. Meanwhile, the solar photovoltaic (PV) industry is growing rapidly in the U.S. and generating many jobs that represent employment opportunities for laid off coal workers. In order to determine the viability of a smooth transition from coal to PV-related employment, this paper provides an analysis of the cost to retrain current coal workers for solar photovoltaic industry employment in the U.S. The current coal industry positions are determined, the skill set evaluated and the salaries tabulated. For each type of coal position, the closest equivalent PV position is determined and then the re-training time and investment are quantified. These values are applied on a state-by-state basis for coal producing states employing the bulk of coal workers as a function of time using a reverse seniority retirement program for the current American fleet of coal-powered plants. The results show that a relatively minor investment in retraining would allow the vast majority of coal workers to switch to PV-related positions even in the event of the elimination of the coal industry. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

In May 2013 the Cassini RADAR altimeter observed channels in Vid Flumina, a drainage network connected to Titan's second largest hydrocarbon sea, Ligeia Mare. Analysis of these altimeter echoes shows that the channels are located in deep (up to ~570m), steep-sided, canyons and have strong specular surface reflections that indicate they are currently liquid filled. Elevations of the liquid in these channels are at the same level as Ligeia Mare to within a vertical precision of about 0.7m, consistent with the interpretation of drowned river valleys. Specular reflections are also observed in lower order tributaries elevated above the level of Ligeia Mare, consistent with drainage feeding into the main channel system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Is the detection of accelerated sea level rise imminent?](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep31245)
___


**Abstract**:

*Global mean sea level rise estimated from satellite altimetry provides a strong constraint on climate variability and change and is expected to accelerate as the rates of both ocean warming and cryospheric mass loss increase over time. In stark contrast to this expectation however, current altimeter products show the rate of sea level rise to have decreased from the first to second decades of the altimeter era. Here, a combined analysis of altimeter data and specially designed climate model simulations shows the 1991 eruption of Mt Pinatubo to likely have masked the acceleration that would have otherwise occurred. This masking arose largely from a recovery in ocean heat content through the mid to late 1990 s subsequent to major heat content reductions in the years following the eruption. A consequence of this finding is that barring another major volcanic eruption, a detectable acceleration is likely to emerge from the noise of internal climate variability in the coming decade.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Climate warming reduces fish production and benthic habitat in Lake Tanganyika, one of the most biodiverse freshwater ecosystems](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/08/02/1603237113)
___

**Significance**:

*Understanding how climate change affects ecosystem productivity is critical for managing fisheries and sustaining biodiversity. African lakes are warming rapidly, potentially jeopardizing both their high endemic biodiversity and important fisheries. Using paleoecological records from Lake Tanganyika, we show that declines in commercially important fishes and endemic molluscs have accompanied lake warming. Ongoing declines in fishery species began well before the advent of commercial fishing in the mid-20th century. Warming has intensified the stratification of the water column, thereby trapping nutrients in deep water where they cannot fuel primary production and food webs. Simultaneously, warming has enlarged the low-oxygen zone, considerably narrowing the coastal habitat where most of Tanganyikas endemic species are found.*

**Abstract**:

*Warming climates are rapidly transforming lake ecosystems worldwide, but the breadth of changes in tropical lakes is poorly documented. Sustainable management of freshwater fisheries and biodiversity requires accounting for historical and ongoing stressors such as climate change and harvest intensity. This is problematic in tropical Africa, where records of ecosystem change are limited and local populations rely heavily on lakes for nutrition. Here, using a 1,500-y paleoecological record, we show that declines in fishery species and endemic molluscs began well before commercial fishing in Lake Tanganyika, Africas deepest and oldest lake. Paleoclimate and instrumental records demonstrate sustained warming in this lake during the last 150 y, which affects biota by strengthening and shallowing stratification of the water column. Reductions in lake mixing have depressed algal production and shrunk the oxygenated benthic habitat by 38% in our study areas, yielding fish and mollusc declines. Late-20th century fish fossil abundances at two of three sites were lower than at any other time in the last millennium and fell in concert with reduced diatom abundance and warming water. A negative correlation between lake temperature and fish and mollusc fossils over the last 500 y indicates that climate warming and intensifying stratification have almost certainly reduced potential fishery production, helping to explain ongoing declines in fish catches. Long-term declines of both benthic and pelagic species underscore the urgency of strategic efforts to sustain Lake Tanganyikas extraordinary biodiversity and ecosystem services.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Influence of oil and gas emissions on summertime ozone in the Colorado Northern Front Range](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JD025265/abstract)
___

**Abstract**:

Tropospheric O3 has been decreasing across much of the eastern U.S. but has remained steady or even increased in some western regions. Recent increases in VOC and NOx emissions associated with the production of oil and natural gas (O NG) may contribute to this trend in some areas. The Northern Front Range of Colorado has regularly exceeded O3 air quality standards during summertime in recent years. This region has VOC emissions from a rapidly developing O NG basin and low concentrations of biogenic VOC in close proximity to urban-Denver NOx emissions. Here VOC OH reactivity (OHR), O3 production efficiency (OPE), and an observationally constrained box model are used to quantify the influence of O NG emissions on regional summertime O3 production. Analyses are based on measurements acquired over two summers at a central location within the Northern Front Range that lies between major regional O NG and urban emission sectors. Observational analyses suggest that mixing obscures any OPE differences in air primarily influenced by O NG or urban emission sector. The box model confirms relatively modest OPE differences that are within the uncertainties of the field observations. Box model results also indicate that maximum O3 at the measurement location is sensitive to changes in NOx mixing ratio but also responsive to O NG VOC reductions. Combined, these analyses show that O NG alkanes contribute over 80% to the observed carbon mixing ratio, roughly 50% to the regional VOC OHR, and approximately 20% to regional photochemical O3 production. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's like you made your own conclusion, entirely ignoring the discussion of not only the paper you linked, but also this study.

The following is according to the 2012 paper you have linked. The accumulation rate at Camp Century, while at ~0.32m/y, clearly shows a negative trend over the decades as the authors themselves state:

In Northern Greenland we only have few data... but the data that do exist show a drop in accumulation rate across the divide and also indicate a significant change in the 18O-accumulation relationship.

Three of the four records that contain recent data indicate an increase in temperature for the decade after 2000 AD.
For NEEM [ie. Camp Century] and B26, the decade 20002009 has the warmest 18O value of the records of 270 yr and 110 yr, respectively. In the 1820 yr long record from NGRIP only four decades have warmer 18O values than 20002009. At Camp Century no increase in accumulation rate or 18O can be seen, and the record from ACT10A is too short to draw any conclusions from. Thus, no conclusive statement can be made about the accumulation rate from these ice core data, but they indicate an increase in temperature after 2000 AD.

I'll leave you to *actually* read the open access study linked ITT that relates to the article.

**Abstract**:

*In 1959 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built Camp Century beneath the surface of the northwestern Greenland Ice Sheet. There they studied the feasibility of deploying ballistic missiles within the ice sheet. The base and its wastes were abandoned with minimal decommissioning in 1967, under the assumption they would be preserved for eternity by perpetually accumulating snowfall. Here we show that a transition in ice sheet surface mass balance at Camp Century from net accumulation to net ablation is plausible within the next 75 years, under a business-as-usual anthropogenic emissions scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5). Net ablation would guarantee the eventual remobilization of physical, chemical, biological, and radiological wastes abandoned at the site. While Camp Century and four other contemporaneous ice sheet bases were legally established under a Danish-U.S. treaty, the potential remobilization of their abandoned wastes, previously regarded as sequestered, represents an entirely new pathway of political dispute resulting from climate change.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I generally agree with some of the concerns for increasing the likely hood with regard to pathogen mobility under increasingly warming conditions, it should be noted that anthrax outbreaks within the Arctic are not restricted to the more recent decades:

Study: [An Overview of Early Anthrax Outbreaks in Northern Canada: Field Reports of the Health of Animals Branch, Agriculture Canada, 1962-71](http://arctic.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/761)
___

**Abstract**:

Between 1962 and 1971, six outbreaks of anthrax occurred in the bison herds of the Northwest Territories and northern Alberta. In response, the federal Health of Animals Branch dispatched staff veterinarians to oversee carcass disposal operations and later to take part in bison depopulation and vaccination programs. Recently, a collection of documents from that agency concerning the outbreaks was discovered in the federal archives. The collection includes field reports from the veterinarians that provide valuable, detailed, first-person accounts of the outbreaks and later programs, information which has generally been lacking in the published literature. The reports identify at least 1102 bison that died of anthrax during the six outbreaks, dozens more than reported previously. They also indicate that the disease spread into Wood Buffalo National Park in 1963, rather than in 1964, as reported previously. A minimum of 598 healthy bison were also killed in depopulation programs aimed at preventing the spread of anthrax into the Park, even though anthrax carcasses had already been discovered within the Park and the targeted regions would be repopulated within weeks. Coverage and revaccination rates were low throughout the vaccination program, and a further 828 bison died during the vaccine roundups. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [A synthesis of the basal thermal state of the Greenland Ice Sheet](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015JF003803/full)
___

**Abstract**:

The basal thermal state of an ice sheet (frozen or thawed) is an important control upon its evolution, dynamics, and response to external forcings. However, this state can only be observed directly at sparse boreholes or inferred conclusively from the presence of subglacial lakes. Here we synthesize spatially extensive inferences of the basal thermal state of the Greenland Ice Sheet to better constrain this state. Existing inferences include outputs from the eight thermomechanical ice-flow models included in the Sea Level Response to Ice Sheet Evolution (SeaRISE) effort. New remote-sensing inferences of the basal thermal state are derived from Holocene radiostratigraphy, modern surface velocity, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery. Both thermomechanical modeling and remote inferences generally agree that the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream and large portions of the southwestern ice-drainage systems are thawed at the bed, whereas the bed beneath the central ice divides, particularly their west facing slopes, is frozen. Elsewhere, there is poorer agreement regarding the basal thermal state. Both models and remote inferences rarely represent the borehole-observed basal thermal state accurately near NorthGRIP and DYE-3. This synthesis identifies a large portion of the Greenland Ice Sheet (about one third by area), where additional observations would most improve knowledge of its overall basal thermal state. </TEXT>

Both thermomechanical modeling and remote inferences generally agree that the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream and large portions of the southwestern ice-drainage systems are thawed at the bed, whereas the bed beneath the central ice divides, particularly their west facing slopes, is frozen. Elsewhere, there is poorer agreement regarding the basal thermal state. Both models and remote inferences rarely represent the borehole-observed basal thermal state accurately near NorthGRIP and DYE-3. This synthesis identifies a large portion of the Greenland Ice Sheet (about one third by area), where additional observations would most improve knowledge of its overall basal thermal state. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [The collapse of Io's primary atmosphere in Jupiter eclipse](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JE005025/full)
___

**Abstract**:

Volcanic outgassing due to tidal heating is the ultimate source of a tenuous SO2 atmosphere around Jupiter's moon Io. The question of whether SO2 frost on the surface plays a part, and to what degree, in maintaining Io's atmosphere with the constant volcanic outgassing is still debated. It is believed that for a sublimation-supported atmosphere, the primary atmosphere should collapse during eclipses by Jupiter, as the SO2 vapor pressure is strongly coupled to the temperature of the ice on the surface. No direct observations of Io's atmosphere in eclipse have previously been possible, due to the simultaneous need for high spectral and time sensitivity, as well as a high signal-to-noise ratio. Here we present the first ever high-resolution spectra at 19m of Io's SO2 atmosphere in Jupiter eclipse from the Gemini telescope. The strongest atmospheric band depth is seen to dramatically decay from 2.5(0.08)% before the eclipse to 0.18(0.16)% after 40min in eclipse. Further modeling indicates that the atmosphere has collapsed shortly after eclipse ingress, implying that the atmosphere of Io has a strong sublimation-controlled component. The atmospheric column densityfrom pre-eclipse to in-eclipsedrops by a factor of 52. </TEXT>

Note the confidence factor (L for Low) and the margin of error from [the IPCC](http://www.realclimate.org/images/ipcc_rad_forc_ar5.jpg). Cloud dynamics are highly complex and it remains amongst the largest areas of uncertainty in climate modelling:

...existing methods of representing convection and clouds are crude, and, in some cases, can be shown even to be qualitatively incorrect.

<TEXT> Study: [Scale-dependent regional climate predictability over North America inferred from CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensemble simulations](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00376-016-6013-2)
___

**Abstract**:

Through the analysis of ensembles of coupled model simulations and projections collected from CMIP3 and CMIP5, we demonstrate that a fundamental spatial scale limit might exist below which useful additional refinement of climate model predictions and projections may not be possible. That limit varies among climate variables and from region to region. We show that the uncertainty (noise) in surface temperature predictions (represented by the spread among an ensemble of global climate model simulations) generally exceeds the ensemble mean (signal) at horizontal scales below 1000 km throughout North America, implying poor predictability at those scales. More limited skill is shown for the predictability of regional precipitation. The ensemble spread in this case tends to exceed or equal the ensemble mean for scales below 2000 km. These findings highlight the challenges in predicting regionally specific future climate anomalies, especially for hydroclimatic impacts such as drought and wetness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Timing and causes of mid-Holocene mammoth extinction on St. Paul Island, Alaska](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/07/27/1604903113)
___


**Significance**:

St. Paul Island, Alaska, is famous for its late-surviving population of woolly mammoth. The puzzle of mid-Holocene extinction is solved via multiple independent paleoenvironmental proxies that tightly constrain the timing of extinction to 5,600  100 y ago and strongly point to the effects of sea-level rise and drier climates on freshwater scarcity as the primary extinction driver. Likely ecosystem effects of the mega-herbivore extinction include reduced rates of watershed erosion by elimination of crowding around water holes and a vegetation shift toward increased abundances of herbaceous taxa. Freshwater availability may be an underappreciated driver of island extinction. This study reinforces 21st-century concerns about the vulnerability of island populations, including humans, to future warming, freshwater availability, and sea level rise.

**Abstract**:

Relict woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) populations survived on several small Beringian islands for thousands of years after mainland populations went extinct. Here we present multiproxy paleoenvironmental records to investigate the timing, causes, and consequences of mammoth disappearance from St. Paul Island, Alaska. Five independent indicators of extinction show that mammoths survived on St. Paul until 5,600  100 y ago. Vegetation composition remained stable during the extinction window, and there is no evidence of human presence on the island before 1787 CE, suggesting that these factors were not extinction drivers. Instead, the extinction coincided with declining freshwater resources and drier climates between 7,850 and 5,600 y ago, as inferred from sedimentary magnetic susceptibility, oxygen isotopes, and diatom and cladoceran assemblages in a sediment core from a freshwater lake on the island, and stable nitrogen isotopes from mammoth remains. Contrary to other extinction models for the St. Paul mammoth population, this evidence indicates that this mammoth population died out because of the synergistic effects of shrinking island area and freshwater scarcity caused by rising sea levels and regional climate change. Degradation of water quality by intensified mammoth activity around the lake likely exacerbated the situation. The St. Paul mammoth demise is now one of the best-dated prehistoric extinctions, highlighting freshwater limitation as an overlooked extinction driver and underscoring the vulnerability of small island populations to environmental change, even in the absence of human influence.

<TEXT> Study: [More extreme precipitation in the worlds dry and wet regions](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v6/n5/full/nclimate2941.html)
___

**Abstract**:

*Intensification of the hydrological cycle is expected to accompany a warming climate. It has been suggested that changes in the spatial distribution of precipitation will amplify differences between dry and wet regions, but this has been disputed for changes over land. Furthermore, precipitation changes may differ not only between regions but also between different aspects of precipitation, such as totals and extremes. Here we investigate changes in these two aspects in the worlds dry and wet regions using observations and global climate models. Despite uncertainties in total precipitation changes, extreme daily precipitation averaged over both dry and wet regimes shows robust increases in both observations and climate models over the past six decades. Climate projections for the rest of the century show continued intensification of daily precipitation extremes. Increases in total and extreme precipitation in dry regions are linearly related to the model-specific global temperature change, so that the spread in projected global warming partly explains the spread in precipitation intensification in these regions by the late twenty-first century. This intensification has implications for the risk of flooding as the climate warms, particularly for the worlds dry regions.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> If humanity makes it to the next glacial period, what's going to happen really?

That's a good question, and one full of speculation  \\\_()_/. I can say that humanity won't see the next glacial period for a considerable length of time though. Given our current configuration - where the continents are located, ocean currents, etc. numerous studies have shown that CO2 emissions are required to fall below ~240-280ppm before the next glacial period would occur on natural cycles due to Milankovitch cycles. Currently atmospheric CO2 is sitting above [400ppm](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/) and expected to rise under [different RCP scenarios](http://i.imgur.com/2Hr4eQE.jpg). That being said, human emissions have therefore delayed the onset of the next glacial period for [~100,000 years](https://www.carbonbrief.org/human-emissions-will-delay-next-ice-age-by-50000-years-study-says). For the sake of clarity as to why it's speculative at best as to "what's going to happen" if humanity makes it to the next glacial period a simple thought experiment should suffice: Simply ask yourself how well predictions made a mere 100 years ago turned out... now extend that further back to 200 years... ok, now how about a few thousand years ago during such times as the Egyptians and Babylonians? Our species, *Homo Sapiens*, only arose ~195,000 years ago... clearly then, predicting what will happen in 100,000 years time is anybody's guess.  

It seems we would be more likely to be wiped out by a glacial periods than the size of the sun increasing...

It's not necessarily about whether or not the change is with regard to cooling or warming, but rather how abrupt the change is. In other words, can the terrestrial biosphere adapt rapidly enough? Most extinction events are preceded by abrupt warming as cooling typically occurs on far slower time scales (it takes time for massive ice sheets to grow, but they can collapse catastrophically when warmed).

Is there a connection between global warming and glacial periods?

Milankovitch cycles may be one component, though there are seemingly countless components that form a complex system of positive and negative feedbacks. Our current warming, however, can be entirely attributed to human activity.

Thanks for your time and knowledge!

<TEXT> He incorrectly used the term ice age, and should have used glacial periods (though the last glacial period is also confusingly known as "the Ice Age"). We are currently still in an ice age which began ~2.58Ma (million years ago) which marks the start of the Pliestocene. We are currently within an interglacial period which began ~11.7ka (thousand years ago) and marks the start of the Holocene - a period of relatively unusual stability within the climate system. Glacial periods are marked with even numbers, and interglacial periods are marked with odd numbers (known as Marine Isotope Stages): https://i.imgur.com/Rxim2EO.jpg </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anyway, I think you missed the point of what I was saying in my very short comment...

I think you missed /u/orthag's point. You statement assumes that every glacial period (not ice age as you incorrectly state) had the same conditions as the previous glacial period. This couldn't be further from the truth. Each glacial / interglacial period had its own unique characteristics. However, a general trend can be observed such that the [more recent glacial periods were colder than previous episodes](https://i.imgur.com/Rxim2EO.jpg), not only did their durations differ but their ice extent became greater and ice sheets became thicker. While they may have experience previous glacial episodes, they had not experienced the likes of any that came after the previous glacial period. This is further observed whereby "Neandertals were processing faunal remains more heavily during glacial periods, suggesting a response to increased nutritional stress during colder time periods."^[1](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004724841630001X)       </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

*Neandertals disappeared from Europe just after 40,000 years ago. Some hypotheses ascribe this to numerous population crashes associated with glacial cycles in the late Pleistocene. The goal of this paper is to test the hypothesis that glacial periods stressed Neandertal populations. If cold climates stressed Neandertals, their subsistence behaviors may have changedrequiring intensified use of prey through more extensive nutrient extraction from faunal carcasses. To test this, an analysis of Neandertal butchering was conducted on medium sized bovid/cervid remains composed of predominately red deer (Cervus elaphus), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), and roe deer (Capreolus caprelous) deposited during global warm and cold phases from two French sites: Pech de l'Az IV (Pech IV, Bordes' excavation) and Roc de Marsal (RDM). Analysis of surface modification on high survival long bones and proximal and middle phalanges demonstrates that skeletal elements excavated from the cold levels (RDM Level 4, Pech IV Level I2) at each cave have more cut marks and percussion marks than elements from the warm levels (RDM Level 9, Pech IV Level Y-Z) after controlling for fragment size. At both sites, epiphyseal fragments are rare, and although this pattern can result from carnivore consumption, carnivore tooth marks are almost nonexistent (0.1%). Alternatively, processing epiphyseal ends for bone grease may have been a Neandertal survival strategy, and epiphyses were more intensively percussed in cold levels than in warm levels at both RDM and Pech IV. The exploitation of low marrow yield elements such as phalanges does not show a consistent pattern relating to climate, but may have been a general Neandertal behavioral characteristic, suggesting that these hominids were regularly on the edge of sufficient nutrient availability even during interglacials. Overall, the faunal assemblages from Roc de Marsal and Pech IV provide some support for the hypothesis that Neandertals were processing faunal remains more heavily during glacial periods, suggesting a response to increased nutritional stress during colder time periods.* </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Storage of anthropogenic CO2 in geological formations relies on a caprock as the primary seal preventing buoyant super-critical CO2 escaping. Although natural CO2 reservoirs demonstrate that CO2 may be stored safely for millions of years, uncertainty remains in predicting how caprocks will react with CO2-bearing brines. This uncertainty poses a significant challenge to the risk assessment of geological carbon storage. Here we describe mineral reaction fronts in a CO2 reservoir-caprock system exposed to CO2 over a timescale comparable with that needed for geological carbon storage. The propagation of the reaction front is retarded by redox-sensitive mineral dissolution reactions and carbonate precipitation, which reduces its penetration into the caprock to ~7 cm in ~10^5 years. This distance is an order-of-magnitude smaller than previous predictions. The results attest to the significance of transport-limited reactions to the long-term integrity of sealing behaviour in caprocks exposed to CO2. </TEXT>

**Highlights**:

 Over 12,000 deaths recorded globally due to glacier floods.

 Recurrence intervals calculated based on volume, discharge and damage.

 Damage type and index determined per event, per country and per major world region
___

**Abstract**:

*Glacier outburst floods are sudden releases of large amounts of water from a glacier. They are a pervasive natural hazard worldwide. They have an association with climate primarily via glacier mass balance and their impacts on society partly depend on population pressure and land use. Given the ongoing changes in climate and land use and population distributions there is therefore an urgent need to discriminate the spatio-temporal patterning of glacier outburst floods and their impacts. This study presents data compiled from 20 countries and comprising 1348 glacier floods spanning 10 centuries. Societal impacts were assessed using a relative damage index based on recorded deaths, evacuations, and property and infrastructure destruction and disruption. These floods originated from 332 sites; 70% were from ice-dammed lakes and 36% had recorded societal impact. The number of floods recorded has apparently reduced since the mid-1990s in all major world regions. Two thirds of sites that have produced  5 floods (n = 32) have floods occurring progressively earlier in the year. Glacier floods have directly caused at least: 7 deaths in Iceland, 393 deaths in the European Alps, 5745 deaths in South America and 6300 deaths in central Asia. Peru, Nepal and India have experienced fewer floods yet higher levels of damage. One in five sites in the European Alps has produced floods that have damaged farmland, destroyed homes and damaged bridges; 10% of sites in South America have produced glacier floods that have killed people and damaged infrastructure; 15% of sites in central Asia have produced floods that have inundated farmland, destroyed homes, damaged roads and damaged infrastructure. Overall, Bhutan and Nepal have the greatest national-level economic consequences of glacier flood impacts. We recommend that accurate, full and standardised monitoring, recording and reporting of glacier floods is essential if spatio-temporal patterns in glacier flood occurrence, magnitude and societal impact are to be better understood. We note that future modelling of the global impact of glacier floods cannot assume that the same trends will continue and will need to consider combining land-use change with probability distributions of geomorphological responses to climate change and to human activity.* </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

*Polar temperatures over the last several million years have, at times, been slightly warmer than today, yet global mean sea level has been 69metres higher as recently as the Last Interglacial (130,000 to 115,000 years ago) and possibly higher during the Pliocene epoch (about three million years ago). In both cases the Antarctic ice sheet has been implicated as the primary contributor, hinting at its future vulnerability. Here we use a model coupling ice sheet and climate dynamicsincluding previously underappreciated processes linking atmospheric warming with hydrofracturing of buttressing ice shelves and structural collapse of marine-terminating ice cliffsthat is calibrated against Pliocene and Last Interglacial sea-level estimates and applied to future greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Antarctica has the potential to contribute more than a metre of sea-level rise by 2100 and more than 15metres by 2500, if emissions continue unabated. In this case atmospheric warming will soon become the dominant driver of ice loss, but prolonged ocean warming will delay its recovery for thousands of years.* </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

*Low atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration during the Little Ice Age has been used to derive the global carbon cycle sensitivity to temperature. Recent evidence confirms earlier indications that the low CO2 was caused by increased terrestrial carbon storage. It remains unknown whether the terrestrial biosphere responded to temperature variations, or there was vegetation re-growth on abandoned farmland. Here we present a global numerical simulation of atmospheric carbonyl sulfide concentrations in the pre-industrial period. Carbonyl sulfide concentration is linked to changes in gross primary production and shows a positive anomaly during the Little Ice Age. We show that a decrease in gross primary production and a larger decrease in ecosystem respiration is the most likely explanation for the decrease in atmospheric CO2 and increase in atmospheric carbonyl sulfide concentrations. Therefore, temperature change, not vegetation re-growth, was the main cause of the increased terrestrial carbon storage. We address the inconsistency between ice-core CO2 records from different sites measuring CO2 and 13CO2 in ice from Dronning Maud Land (Antarctica). Our interpretation allows us to derive the temperature sensitivity of pre-industrial CO2 fluxes for the terrestrial biosphere (L = 10 to 90 Pg C K^1 ), implying a positive climate feedback and providing a benchmark to reduce model uncertainties.* </TEXT>

Our interpretation allows us to derive the temperature sensitivity of pre-industrial CO2 fluxes for the terrestrial biosphere (L = 10 to 90PgCK^1 ), implying a positive climate feedback and providing a benchmark to reduce model uncertainties. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jason 2 displays time frames accurately and in easily understood format.

They all appeared to be displayed accurately and were easily understood though... are you referencing something other than the those available through the [time series](http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/ocean-indicators-products/mean-sea-level/products-images.html)? 

Again, I'm curious as to why you have opted to select the Jason 2 time series as opposed to others available. I can understand why you would choose it for more recent times, but then why not Saral? Do you think Saral is currently too short of a time series? Do 'climate norms' exist for SLR?

...stop over at the ASIF, in the consequences folder...

Providing a direct link is the courteous thing to do if you know where it is, and others don't. You really expect me to sift through [13 pages](http://forum.arctic-sea-ice.net/index.php?topic=874.0) for a single post or two on Jason 2? I'm well aware of the consequences of SLR so if that's all you're directing me to I think I'll pass. That being said, the forum does present a number of interesting discussions worth exploring. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Genetic structure of the beaked whale genus Berardius in the North Pacific, with genetic evidence for a new species](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mms.12345/abstract)
___

**Abstract**:

There are two recognized species in the genus Berardius, Baird's and Arnoux's beaked whales. In Japan, whalers have traditionally recognized two forms of Baird's beaked whales, the common slate-gray form and a smaller, rare black form. Previous comparison of mtDNA control region sequences from three black specimens to gray specimens around Japan indicated that the two forms comprise different stocks and potentially different species. We have expanded sampling to include control region haplotypes of 178 Baird's beaked whales from across their range in the North Pacific. We identified five additional specimens of the black form from the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea, for a total of eight black specimens. The divergence between mtDNA haplotypes of the black and gray forms of Baird's beaked whale was greater than their divergence from the congeneric Arnoux's beaked whale found in the Southern Ocean, and similar to that observed among other congeneric beaked whale species. Taken together, genetic evidence from specimens in Japan and across the North Pacific, combined with evidence of smaller adult body size, indicate presence of an unnamed species of Berardius in the North Pacific. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh trust me, I have, and [continue to do so](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v8/n1/abs/ngeo2316.html). It's an interesting theory, but one certainly not without its problems in its attempts at explaining the large observed carbon isotope excursion.

Its almost embarrassing that we haven't worked out a cause yet, says Wing.

While there are parallels to draw on, I would certainly hesitate to jump to conclusions (ie. methane clathrates).
Also note that I mention the most recent glacial and interglacial periods, extending back ~2.6Ma to the start of the Pleistocene as they are most similar to todays' environment. The PETM occurred ~56Ma. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But doesn't all this hope for survival go out the window once you factor in the methane being released from the artic?

No, methane release from permafrost and offshore hydrates - while a concern - is far too often hyped as some apocalyptic scenario (ie. [clathrate gun hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_gun_hypothesis)) that there simply isn't evidence to support. 

One such example, from the craters being observed in Siberia:

[How much methane came out of that hole in Siberia?](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2014/08/how-much-methane-came-out-of-that-hole-in-siberia/comment-page-2/)

...If the bubble was pure methane, it would have contained about  wait for it  0.000003 Gtons of methane. In other words, building a Shakhova event from these explosions would take approximately 20,000,000 explosions, all within a few years, or else the climate impact of the methane would be muted by the lifetime effect.

A recent study also found "[No significant increase in long-term CH4 emissions on North Slope of Alaska despite significant increase in air temperature](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL069292/full)":

Our results suggest that even the observed short-term temperature sensitivity from the Arctic will have little impact on the global atmospheric CH4 budget in the long term if future trajectories evolve with the same temperature sensitivity.

While current warming is certainly abrupt, the arctic has scene abrupt warming in its past throughout multiple glacial and interglacial periods - (~1C per year for 5 years in steps, and an unbelievable 5-10C warming per year or 100 and 1,000 times faster warming than current warming respectively) - why is there no record of catastrophic methane release then from those periods? Because it didn't happen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Observed and simulated full-depth ocean heat-content changes for 19702005](http://www.ocean-sci.net/12/925/2016/)
___

**Abstract**:

*Greenhouse-gas emissions have created a planetary energy imbalance that is primarily manifested by increasing ocean heat content (OHC). Updated observational estimates of full-depth OHC change since 1970 are presented that account for recent advancements in reducing observation errors and biases. The full-depth OHC has increased by 0.74 [0.68, 0.80]1022Jyr^1 (0.46Wm^2 ) and 1.22 [1.161.29]1022Jyr^1 (0.75Wm^2 ) for 19702005 and 19922005, respectively, with a 5 to 95% confidence interval of the median. The CMIP5 models show large spread in OHC changes, suggesting that some models are not state-of-the-art and require further improvements. However, the ensemble median has excellent agreement with our observational estimate: 0.68 [0.540.82]1022Jyr^1 (0.42Wm^2 ) from 1970 to 2005 and 1.25 [1.101.41]1022Jyr^1 (0.77Wm^2 ) from 1992 to 2005. These results increase confidence in both the observational and model estimates to quantify and study changes in Earth's energy imbalance over the historical period. We suggest that OHC be a fundamental metric for climate model validation and evaluation, especially for forced changes (decadal timescales).*

Study: [Industrial-era global ocean heat uptake doubles in recent decades](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v6/n4/full/nclimate2915.html)
___

**Abstract**:

*Formal detection and attribution studies have used observations and climate models to identify an anthropogenic warming signature in the upper (0700m) ocean. Recently, as a result of the so-called surface warming hiatus, there has been considerable interest in global ocean heat content (OHC) changes in the deeper ocean, including natural and anthropogenically forced changes identified in observational modelling and data re-analysis studies. Here, we examine OHC changes in the context of the Earths global energy budget since early in the industrial era (circa 18652015) for a range of depths. We rely on OHC change estimates from a diverse collection of measurement systems including data from the nineteenth-century Challenger expedition, a multi-decadal record of ship-based in situ mostly upper-ocean measurements, the more recent near-global Argo floats profiling to intermediate (2,000m) depths, and full-depth repeated transoceanic sections. We show that the multi-model mean constructed from the current generation of historically forced climate models is consistent with the OHC changes from this diverse collection of observational systems. Our model-based analysis suggests that nearly half of the industrial-era increases in global OHC have occurred in recent decades, with over a third of the accumulated heat occurring below 700m and steadily rising.*

Study: [Insights into Earths energy imbalance from multiple sources](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0339.1)
___

**Abstract**:

*The current Earths energy imbalance (EEI) can best be estimated from changes in ocean heat content (OHC), complemented by top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiation measurements and an assessment of the small non-ocean components. Sustained observations from the Argo array of autonomous profiling floats enable near-global estimates of OHC since 2005, which reveal considerable cancellation of variations in the upper 300 m. An analysis of the monthly contributions to EEI from non-ocean (land and ice) using the CESM Large Ensemble reveals standard deviations of 0.3 to 0.4 W m^-2 (global); largest values occur in August, but values are below 0.75 W m^-2 95% of the time. Global standard deviations of EEI of 0.64 W m^-2 based on top-of-atmosphere observations therefore substantially constrain ocean contributions, given by the tendencies of OHC. Instead, monthly standard deviations of many Argo-based OHC tendencies are 6 to 13 W m^-2 and non-physical fluctuations are clearly evident. We show that an ocean reanalysis with multi-variate dynamical data assimilation features much better agreement with TOA radiation, and 44% of the vertically-integrated short-term OHC trend for 2005-14 of 0.80.2 W m^-2 (globally) occurs below 700 m depth. Largest warming occurs from 20 to 50S, especially over the Southern Oceans, and near 40N, in all ocean analyses. The EEI is estimated to be 0.90.3 W m^-2 for 2005-2014.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not completely open to question, it's a matter of scientific study and the majority of evidence points to the onset of *modern* plate tectonics somewhere in the vicinity of 3-3.2Ga. I pointed this out already in my previous response to your initial word vomit. I'm calling it a word vomit because, much like you have done here, you appear to be all over the place, and take singular studies or authors, and give them just as much weight and credibility as the general consensus.  

 Even if it didn't exist like today, it could have started as sagduction or other mechanisms. 

No one is discussing about how modern plate tectonics could have started though, so why do you feel it necessary to include? 'Sagduction' is a direct result of the underlying belief that plate tectonics could not have operated in a hot early Earth and that another mechanism must have operated to recycle oceanic crust back into the mantle. Again, this was discussed in my previous comment under 'drip tectonics.'    

It's a mental workout trying to tell what point it is that you are trying to make because much of your comment is so tangential, and so much is taken as gospel or does not follow from the study's results (ie. negating the LHB due to [Imbrium impact](https://news.brown.edu/articles/2016/07/imbrium) which the authors themselves conclude *["contributed](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v535/n7612/full/nature18278.html) to the LHB")*.

But even with some putative persistent ocean crust before modern island arcs resulted from Cavosie's early plate tectonics, the result is much the same I would think. Vents would be more common, fresh water UV pools or ocean shallows less common.

b) On the difference between putative and tenuous: 

 - putative putative pyooddiv/ adjective: putative "generally considered or reputed to be."

 - repute rpyoot/ verb past participle: reputed "be widely known and respected."

 - tenuous tenyoos/ adjective adjective: tenuous "very weak or slight."

The evidence for modern plate tectonics, and by extension, island arc volcanism dating back prior to ~3.0 Ga is not widely assumed, or putative, it is tenuous if existent at all.

<TEXT> Study: [Earths oxygen cycle and the evolution of animal life](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/07/20/1521544113.abstract.html?etoc)
___

**Significance**:

*Earth is currently the only planet known to harbor complex life. Understanding whether terrestrial biotic complexity is a unique phenomenon or can be expected to be widespread in the universe depends on a mechanistic understanding of the factors that led to the emergence of complex life on Earth. Here, we use geochemical constraints and quantitative models to suggest that marine environments may have been unfavorable for the emergence and large-scale proliferation of motile multicellular life for most of Earths history. Further, we argue that a holistic evaluation of environmental variability, organismal life history, and spatial ecological dynamics is essential for a full accounting of the factors that have allowed for the emergence of biological complexity on Earth.*

**Abstract**:

*The emergence and expansion of complex eukaryotic life on Earth is linked at a basic level to the secular evolution of surface oxygen levels. However, the role that planetary redox evolution has played in controlling the timing of metazoan (animal) emergence and diversification, if any, has been intensely debated. Discussion has gravitated toward threshold levels of environmental free oxygen (O2) necessary for early evolving animals to survive under controlled conditions. However, defining such thresholds in practice is not straightforward, and environmental O2 levels can potentially constrain animal life in ways distinct from threshold O2 tolerance. Herein, we quantitatively explore one aspect of the evolutionary coupling between animal life and Earths oxygen cyclethe influence of spatial and temporal variability in surface ocean O2 levels on the ecology of early metazoan organisms. Through the application of a series of quantitative biogeochemical models, we find that large spatiotemporal variations in surface ocean O2 levels and pervasive benthic anoxia are expected in a world with much lower atmospheric pO2 than at present, resulting in severe ecological constraints and a challenging evolutionary landscape for early metazoan life. We argue that these effects, when considered in the light of synergistic interactions with other environmental parameters and variable O2 demand throughout an organisms life history, would have resulted in long-term evolutionary and ecological inhibition of animal life on Earth for much of Middle Proterozoic time (1.80.8 billion years ago).*

'Back then' there were no modern plate tectonics, and there was no continental crust. The Earth was dominated by an ultramafic rock type known as [Komatiite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komatiite) which is incapable of generating thick lava flows, as it's less viscous than basalt (modern oceanic crust), leaving extremely thin lava flows (down to 10 mm thick). Overall, topography would have been far more gentle, seas more shallow, and vents more common. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just some points of possible contention relating to the dates and terminology you've used:

We have a putative 4.1 Ga fossil.

I wouldn't call it putative. Tenuous is [more fitting](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/did-life-really-start-41-billion-years-ago-not-so-fast-180957006/?no-ist). Far better to note the oldest confirmed fossil evidence of life at [3.5 Ga](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/bacteria/cyanofr.html).

If life emerged before 4.1 Ga, the amount of land may have been **confined to island arcs**...

Island arcs require plate tectonics, and while there is a good degree of debate surrounding the origin of modern plate tectonics (opposed to [drip tectonics](https://speakingofgeoscience.org/2013/04/28/when-did-plate-tectonics-begin-on-earth-and-what-came-before/)) I don't believe there is sufficient evidence to suggest modern plate tectonics 4.1 Ga. Most believe the onset of modern plate tectonics to be roughly a billion years later [~3.0 Ga](https://i.imgur.com/3Cy5I52.jpg) and younger.

If life emerged before 4.1 Ga, it was before the martian habitability period observed by Curiosity...

Mars is believed to have been habitable to life as we know it at least up to 3.7 Ga. Given our lack of extensive, high resolution evidence of Martian geology, it certainly seems unreasonable to issue a a complete timeline of Martian habitability. All we can currently say is that 3.7 Ga years ago Mars contained a habitable environment. 

We have the new Imbrium impact model of a much larger and shallow angle impactor, which should repudiate the crucial Apollo material dating of key Moon craters. And consistent with that we have the lack of expected shock fractures in zircons from the period. Late bombardment is now a theory looking for its observations.

The LHB is certainly not so easily negated, and remains a theory of serious consideration. One would likely have to refute the [Nice model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_model) of planetary migration amongst many others... a feat not so easily achieved as you seem to have implicated. </TEXT>

The analysis is performed on the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 20th Century Reanalysis. The large-scale circulation associated with the cold spells corresponds to advection of cold air from the Arctic region into North America and to a very zonal and intense North Atlantic jet, shifted persistently south of its climatological location. These features of the Atlantic jet are conducive to destructive windstorms and intense precipitation over a large part of southern and continental Europe and the British Isles. The cold spells are preceded by a negative NAO and followed by a positive PNA; however, we interpret the associated circulation anomalies as being distinct from these standard modes of climate variability.* </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

*The concept of a last universal common ancestor of all cells (LUCA, or the progenote) is central to the study of early evolution and life's origin, yet information about how and where LUCA lived is lacking. We investigated all clusters and phylogenetic trees for 6.1 million protein coding genes from sequenced prokaryotic genomes in order to reconstruct the microbial ecology of LUCA. Among 286,514 protein clusters, we identified 355 protein families (0.1%) that trace to LUCA by phylogenetic criteria. Because these proteins are not universally distributed, they can shed light on LUCA's physiology. Their functions, properties and prosthetic groups depict LUCA as anaerobic, CO2-fixing, H2-dependent with a WoodLjungdahl pathway, N2-fixing and thermophilic. LUCA's biochemistry was replete with FeS clusters and radical reaction mechanisms. Its cofactors reveal dependence upon transition metals, flavins, S-adenosyl methionine, coenzyme A, ferredoxin, molybdopterin, corrins and selenium. Its genetic code required nucleoside modifications and S-adenosyl methionine-dependent methylations. The 355 phylogenies identify clostridia and methanogens, whose modern lifestyles resemble that of LUCA, as basal among their respective domains. LUCA inhabited a geochemically active environment rich in H2, CO2 and iron. The data support the theory of an autotrophic origin of life involving the WoodLjungdahl pathway in a hydrothermal setting.* </TEXT>

**Significance**:

*Ethnic divides play a major role in many armed conflicts around the world and might serve as predetermined conflict lines following rapidly emerging societal tensions arising from disruptive events like natural disasters. We find evidence in global datasets that risk of armed-conflict outbreak is enhanced by climate-related disaster occurrence in ethnically fractionalized countries. Although we find no indications that environmental disasters directly trigger armed conflicts, our results imply that disasters might act as a threat multiplier in several of the worlds most conflict-prone regions.*

**Abstract**:

*Social and political tensions keep on fueling armed conflicts around the world. Although each conflict is the result of an individual context-specific mixture of interconnected factors, ethnicity appears to play a prominent and almost ubiquitous role in many of them. This overall state of affairs is likely to be exacerbated by anthropogenic climate change and in particular climate-related natural disasters. Ethnic divides might serve as predetermined conflict lines in case of rapidly emerging societal tensions arising from disruptive events like natural disasters. Here, we hypothesize that climate-related disaster occurrence enhances armed-conflict outbreak risk in ethnically fractionalized countries. Using event coincidence analysis, we test this hypothesis based on data on armed-conflict outbreaks and climate-related natural disasters for the period 19802010. Globally, we find a coincidence rate of 9% regarding armed-conflict outbreak and disaster occurrence such as heat waves or droughts. Our analysis also reveals that, during the period in question, about 23% of conflict outbreaks in ethnically highly fractionalized countries robustly coincide with climatic calamities. Although we do not report evidence that climate-related disasters act as direct triggers of armed conflicts, the disruptive nature of these events seems to play out in ethnically fractionalized societies in a particularly tragic way. This observation has important implications for future security policies as several of the worlds most conflict-prone regions, including North and Central Africa as well as Central Asia, are both exceptionally vulnerable to anthropogenic climate change and characterized by deep ethnic divides.* </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

*The early Eocene (4955 million years ago) is a time interval characterized by elevated surface temperatures and atmospheric CO2, and a flatter-than-present latitudinal surface temperature gradient. The multi-proxy-derived flat temperature gradient has been a challenge to reproduce in model simulations, especially the subtropical warmth at the high-latitude surface oceans, inferred from the archaeal lipid-based palaeothermometry, TEX86 . Here we revisit the TEX86 interpretation by analysing a global collection of multi-proxy temperature estimates from sediment cores spanning millennia to millions of years. Comparing the variability between proxy types, we demonstrate that the present TEX86 interpretation overestimates the magnitude of past climate changes on all timescales.

<TEXT> Study: [Flat meridional temperature gradient in the early Eocene in the subsurface rather than surface ocean](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2763.html)
___

**Abstract**:

*The early Eocene (4955 million years ago) is a time interval characterized by elevated surface temperatures and atmospheric CO2, and a flatter-than-present latitudinal surface temperature gradient. The multi-proxy-derived flat temperature gradient has been a challenge to reproduce in model simulations, especially the subtropical warmth at the high-latitude surface oceans, inferred from the archaeal lipid-based palaeothermometry, TEX86 . Here we revisit the TEX86 interpretation by analysing a global collection of multi-proxy temperature estimates from sediment cores spanning millennia to millions of years. Comparing the variability between proxy types, we demonstrate that the present TEX86 interpretation overestimates the magnitude of past climate changes on all timescales. We attribute this to an inappropriate calibration, which reflects subsurface ocean but is calibrated to the sea surface, where the latitudinal temperature gradient is steeper. Recalibrating the proxy to the temperatures of subsurface ocean, where the signal is probably formed, yields colder TEX86 -temperatures and latitudinal gradient consistent with standard climate model simulations of the Eocene climate, invalidating the apparent, extremely warm polar sea surface temperatures. We conclude that there is a need to reinterpret TEX86 -inferred marine temperature records in the literature, especially for reconstructions of past warm climates that rely heavily on this proxy as reflecting subsurface ocean.* </TEXT>

If you read the actual paper that statement is made because there remain some degree of uncertainty in *some* of the values. Given our current understanding, however, a runaway greenhouse is highly unlikely as to be realistically impossible. 

 What weve shown here is that a runaway greenhouse atmosphere that would sterilize the planet is actually possible for Earth, with the amount of sunlight it receives now, says Goldblatt. Fortunately, it would need 10 times more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to trigger this than burning all of Earths fossil fuels  every bit of coal, oil and gas that exists - would give.

<TEXT> A runaway greenhouse on Earth is realistically unlikely.

Here, we review what is known about the runaway greenhouse to answer this question, describing the various limits on outgoing radiation and how climate will evolve between these. The good news is that almost all lines of evidence lead us to believe that is unlikely to be possible, even in principle, to trigger full a runaway greenhouse by addition of non-condensible greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.

<TEXT> A number of studies have linked climate science denial and/or ignorance with the subject matter to poor education^[1](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6274/664), political alignment^[2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/polp.12122/abstract),[3](https://ejas.revues.org/10305),[4](http://drexel.edu/now/archive/2013/December/Climate-Change/),[5](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656616300666) and personal ideology^[6](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/05/29/this-fascinating-chart-on-faith-and-climate-change-denial-has-been-reinforced-by-new-research/?postshare=5211432921678546),[7](http://jspp.psychopen.eu/article/view/443) 

While the study's focus is targeted at examining the potential effectiveness of climate policy^[8](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2732935), it might also be exploited in order to examine - more closely - the links between education, political alignment, and personal ideology within Canada. A cursory look at how Canadian's voted during the 2015 federal election shows a relatively strong correlation, particularly across areas of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, as seen by the following:

While the 2011 federal election certainly shows a different trend overall, a similar pattern persists across much of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba

It should also be noted that the authors of this study *did* incorporate many of these aspects into their model, which may explain at least some of the similarities seen above. In regard to their model the authors state the following:

"*For district models, we model the geography-level term as: ... [model equation] ... where, for each political geography, drive is the fraction of residents who report driving a car, truck or van to work, christian is the fraction of residents who report themselves as belonging to the Christian faith, industry is the fraction of residents who are employed by mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction industries, and convote is the fraction of votes for the Conservative

<TEXT> Study: [Reconciled climate response estimates from climate models and the energy budget of Earth](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3066.html)
___

**Abstract**:

*Climate risks increase with mean global temperature, so knowledge about the amount of future global warming should better inform risk assessments for policymakers. Expected near-term warming is encapsulated by the transient climate response (TCR), formally defined as the warming following 70 years of 1% per year increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration, by which point atmospheric CO2 has doubled. Studies based on Earths historical energy budget have typically estimated lower values of TCR than climate models, suggesting that some models could overestimate future warming. However, energy-budget estimates rely on historical temperature records that are geographically incomplete and blend air temperatures over land and sea ice with water temperatures over open oceans. We show that there is no evidence that climate models overestimate TCR when their output is processed in the same way as the HadCRUT4 observation-based temperature record. Models suggest that air-temperature warming is 24% greater than observed by HadCRUT4 over 18612009 because slower-warming regions are preferentially sampled and water warms less than air. Correcting for these biases and accounting for wider uncertainties in radiative forcing based on recent evidence, we infer an observation-based best estimate for TCR of 1.66 C, with a 595% range of 1.03.3 C, consistent with the climate models considered in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report.* </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Historic Canadian elections in 2015, both federally and provincially, created an opportunity for action on climate policy. While climate scientists have developed high resolution data sets on the distribution of Canadian climate risks, we still lack comparable data on the local distribution of public climate change opinions. This paper provides the first effort to estimate local climate and energy opinion variability outside the United States. Using a multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) approach, we estimate opinion in federal electoral districts and provinces. We demonstrate that a majority of the Canadian public consistently believes that climate change is happening. Belief in climate change's causes varies geographically, with more attributing it to human activity in urban as opposed to rural areas. Most prominently, we find majority support for carbon cap and trade policy in every province and district. By contrast, support for carbon taxation is more heterogeneous. Compared to the distribution of US climate opinions, Canadians believe climate change is happening at higher levels. This new opinion data set will support climate policy analysis and climate policy decision making at national, provincial and local levels. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Reorganization of the North Atlantic Oscillation during early Holocene deglaciation](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2767.html)
___

**Abstract**:

*The North Atlantic Oscillation is the dominant atmospheric pressure mode in the North Atlantic region and affects winter temperature and precipitation in the Mediterranean, northwest Europe, Greenland, and Asia. The index that describes the sea-level pressure difference between Iceland and the Azores is correlated with a dipole precipitation pattern over northwest Europe and northwest Africa. How the North Atlantic Oscillation will develop as the Greenland ice sheet melts is unclear. A potential past analogue is the early Holocene, during which melting ice sheets around the North Atlantic freshened surface waters, affecting the strength of the meridional overturning circulation. Here we present a Holocene rainfall record from northwest Africa based on speleothem 18O and compare it against a speleothem-based rainfall record from Europe. The two records are positively correlated during the early Holocene, followed by a shift to an anti-correlation, similar to the modern record, during the mid-Holocene. On the basis of our simulations with an Earth system model, we suggest the shift to the anti-correlation reflects a large-scale atmospheric and oceanic reorganization in response to the demise of the Laurentide ice sheet and a strong reduction of meltwater flux to the North Atlantic, pointing to a potential sensitivity of the North Atlantic Oscillation to the melting of ice sheets.* </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

*Predicting long-term trends in forest growth requires accurate characterisation of how the relationship between forest productivity and climatic stress varies across climatic regimes. Using a network of over two million tree-ring observations spanning North America and a space-for-time substitution methodology, we forecast climate impacts on future forest growth. We explored differing scenarios of increased water-use efficiency (WUE) due to CO2-fertilisation, which we simulated as increased effective precipitation. In our forecasts: (1) climate change negatively impacted forest growth rates in the interior west and positively impacted forest growth along the western, southeastern and northeastern coasts; (2) shifting climate sensitivities offset positive effects of warming on high-latitude forests, leaving no evidence for continued boreal greening; and (3) it took a 72% WUE enhancement to compensate for continentally averaged growth declines under RCP 8.5. Our results highlight the importance of locally adapted forest management strategies to handle regional differences in growth responses to climate change.* </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

*Since the 1950s, research stations on the Antarctic Peninsula have recorded some of the largest increases in near-surface air temperature in the Southern Hemisphere. This warming has contributed to the regional retreat of glaciers, disintegration of floating ice shelves and a greening through the expansion in range of various flora. Several interlinked processes have been suggested as contributing to the warming, including stratospheric ozone depletion, local sea-ice loss, an increase in westerly winds, and changes in the strength and location of lowhigh-latitude atmospheric teleconnections. Here we use a stacked temperature record to show an absence of regional warming since the late 1990s. The annual mean temperature has decreased at a statistically significant rate, with the most rapid cooling during the Austral summer. Temperatures have decreased as a consequence of a greater frequency of cold, east-to-southeasterly winds, resulting from more cyclonic conditions in the northern Weddell Sea associated with a strengthening mid-latitude jet. These circulation changes have also increased the advection of sea ice towards the east coast of the peninsula, amplifying their effects. Our findings cover only 1% of the Antarctic continent and emphasize that decadal temperature changes in this region are not primarily associated with the drivers of global temperature change but, rather, reflect the extreme natural internal variability of the regional atmospheric circulation.* </TEXT>

**Abstract**:

*We map recent Greenland Ice Sheet elevation change at high spatial (5 km) and temporal (monthly) resolution using CryoSat-2 altimetry. After correcting for the impact of changing snowpack properties associated with unprecedented surface melting in 2012, we find good agreement (3 cm/yr bias) with airborne measurements. With the aid of regional climate and firn modeling, we compute high spatial and temporal resolution records of Greenland mass evolution, which correlate (R = 0.96) with monthly satellite gravimetry and reveal glacier dynamic imbalance. During 20112014, Greenland mass loss averaged 269  51 Gt/yr. Atmospherically driven losses were widespread, with surface melt variability driving large fluctuations in the annual mass deficit. Terminus regions of five dynamically thinning glaciers, which constitute less than 1% of Greenland's area, contributed more than 12% of the net ice loss. This high-resolution record demonstrates that mass deficits extending over small spatial and temporal scales have made a relatively large contribution to recent ice sheet imbalance.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Human influence on tropical cyclone intensity](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6296/242)
___

**Abstract**:

*Recent assessments agree that tropical cyclone intensity should increase as the climate warms. Less agreement exists on the detection of recent historical trends in tropical cyclone intensity. We interpret future and recent historical trends by using the theory of potential intensity, which predicts the maximum intensity achievable by a tropical cyclone in a given local environment. Although greenhouse gasdriven warming increases potential intensity, climate model simulations suggest that aerosol cooling has largely canceled that effect over the historical record. Large natural variability complicates analysis of trends, as do poleward shifts in the latitude of maximum intensity. In the absence of strong reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, future greenhouse gas forcing of potential intensity will increasingly dominate over aerosol forcing, leading to substantially larger increases in tropical cyclone intensities.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Abstract**:

*Continuous measurements of atmospheric methane (CH4) mole fractions measured by NOAA's Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network in Barrow, AK (BRW), show strong enhancements above background values when winds come from the land sector from July to December from 1986 to 2015, indicating that emissions from arctic tundra continue through autumn and into early winter. Twenty-nine years of measurements show little change in seasonal mean land sector CH4 enhancements, despite an increase in annual mean temperatures of 1.20.8C/decade (2). The record does reveal small increases in CH4 enhancements in November and December after 2010 due to increased late-season emissions. The lack of significant long-term trends suggests that more complex biogeochemical processes are counteracting the observed short-term (monthly) temperature sensitivity of 5.03.6ppb CH4/C. Our results suggest that even the observed short-term temperature sensitivity from the Arctic will have little impact on the global atmospheric CH4 budget in the long term if future trajectories evolve with the same temperature sensitivity.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [The tropical Pacific as a key pacemaker of the variable rates of global warming](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2770.html)
___

**Abstract**:

*Global mean surface temperature change over the past 120 years resembles a rising staircase: the overall warming trend was interrupted by the mid-twentieth-century big hiatus and the warming slowdown since about 1998. The Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation has been implicated in modulations of global mean surface temperatures but which part of the mode drives the variability in warming rates is unclear. Here we present a successful simulation of the global warming staircase since 1900 with a global oceanatmosphere coupled model where tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures are forced to follow the observed evolution. Without prescribed tropical Pacific variability, the same model, on average, produces a continual warming trend that accelerates after the 1960s. We identify four events where the tropical Pacific decadal cooling markedly slowed down the warming trend. Matching the observed spatial and seasonal fingerprints we identify the tropical Pacific as a key pacemaker of the warming staircase, with radiative forcing driving the overall warming trend. Specifically, tropical Pacific variability amplifies the first warming epoch of the 1910s1940s and determines the timing when the big hiatus starts and ends. Our method of removing internal variability from the observed record can be used for real-time monitoring of anthropogenic warming.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (pdf): [The increasing intensity of the strongest tropical
cyclones](http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/PDF/Research/ElsnerKossinJagger2008.pdf)
___

**Abstract**:

*Atlantic tropical cyclones are getting stronger on average, with a 30-year trend that has been related to an increase in ocean temperatures over the Atlantic Ocean and elsewhere. Over the rest of the tropics, however, possible trends in tropical cyclone intensity are less obvious, owing to the unreliability and incompleteness of the observational record and to a restricted focus, in previous trend analyses, on changes in average intensity. Here we overcome these two limitations by examining trends in the upper quantiles of per-cyclone maximum wind speeds (that is, the maximum intensities that cyclones achieve during their lifetimes), estimated from homogeneous data derived from an archive of satellite records. We find significant upward trends for wind speed quantiles above the 70th percentile, with trends as high as 0.3 plus/minus 0.09 ms^-1 yr^-1 (s.e.) for the strongest cyclones. We note separate upward trends in the estimated lifetime-maximum wind speeds of the very strongest tropical cyclones (99th percentile) over each ocean basin, with the largest increase at this quantile occurring over the North Atlantic, although not all basins show statistically significant increases. Our results are qualitatively consistent with the hypothesis that as the seas warm, the ocean has more energy to convert to tropical cyclone wind.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Global climate change driven by soot at the K-Pg boundary as the cause of the mass extinction](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep28427)
___

**Abstract**:

The mass extinction of life 66 million years ago at the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary, marked by the extinctions of dinosaurs and shallow marine organisms, is important because it led to the macroevolution of mammals and appearance of humans. The current hypothesis for the extinction is that an asteroid impact in present-day Mexico formed condensed aerosols in the stratosphere, which caused the cessation of photosynthesis and global near-freezing conditions. Here, we show that the stratospheric aerosols did not induce darkness that resulted in milder cooling than previously thought. We propose a new hypothesis that latitude-dependent climate changes caused by massive stratospheric soot explain the known mortality and survival on land and in oceans at the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary. The stratospheric soot was ejected from the oil-rich area by the asteroid impact and was spread globally. The soot aerosols caused sufficiently colder climates at midhigh latitudes and drought with milder cooling at low latitudes on land, in addition to causing limited cessation of photosynthesis in global oceans within a few months to two years after the impact, followed by surface-water cooling in global oceans in a few years. The rapid climate change induced terrestrial extinctions followed by marine extinctions over several years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [The discovery of the Amazonian tree flora with an updated checklist of all known tree taxa](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep29549)
___

**Abstract**:

*Amazonia is the most biodiverse rainforest on Earth, and the debate over how many tree species grow there remains contentious. Here we provide a checklist of all tree species collected to date, and describe spatial and temporal trends in data accumulation. We report 530,025 unique collections of trees in Amazonia, dating between 1707 and 2015, for a total of 11,676 species in 1225 genera and 140 families. These figures support recent estimates of 16,000 total Amazonian tree species based on ecological plot data from the Amazonian Tree Diversity Network. Botanical collection in Amazonia is characterized by three major peaks, centred around 1840, 1920, and 1980, which are associated with flora projects and the establishment of inventory plots. Most collections were made in the 20th century. The number of collections has increased exponentially, but shows a slowdown in the last two decades. We find that a species range size is a better predictor of the number of times it has been collected than the species estimated basin-wide population size. Finding, describing, and documenting the distribution of the remaining species will require coordinated efforts at under-collected sites.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Intensification and poleward shift of subtropical western boundary currents in a warming climate](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015JC011513/abstract)
___

**Abstract**:

*A significant increase in sea surface temperature (SST) is observed over the mid-latitude western boundary currents (WBCs) during the past century. However, the mechanism for this phenomenon remains poorly understood due to limited observations. In the present paper, several coupled parameters (i.e., sea surface temperature (SST), ocean surface heat fluxes, ocean water velocity, ocean surface winds and sea level pressure (SLP)) are analyzed to identify the dynamic changes of the WBCs. Three types of independent data sets are used, including reanalysis products, satellite-blended observations and climate model outputs from the fifth phase of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Based on these broad ranges of data, we find that the WBCs (except the Gulf Stream) are intensifying and shifting toward the poles as long-term effects of global warming. An intensification and poleward shift of near-surface ocean winds, attributed to positive annular mode-like trends, are proposed to be the forcing of such dynamic changes. In contrast to the other WBCs, the Gulf Stream is expected to be weaker under global warming, which is most likely related to a weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). However, we also notice that the natural variations of WBCs might conceal the long-term effect of global warming in the available observational data sets, especially over the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, long-term observations or proxy data are necessary to further evaluate the dynamics of the WBCs.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> You wouldn't believe the amount of nonsense I go through at times watching submissions being downvoted to oblivion and lambasted by climate science deniers.

For example, one submission had a total of 76 votes and landed a net total of a mere 12 upvotes. The comment section was a mess of climate science denial arguments. I deleted the submission in hopes of better results upon resubmitting the article... it did fair slightly better; however, it was still disappointing: 40 total votes resulting in a mere 8 net upvotes. Perhaps I hold the public, specifically those contributing to subs such as /r/science, in too high a regard, but I truly believe that the example above is not a result of their actions, but rather a result of astroturfing (and the like) by ever increasing funding from the right.

___

**Abstract**:

*The literature on the costs of climate change often draws a link between climatic tipping points and large economic shocks, frequently called catastrophes. The phrase tipping points in this context can be misleading. In popular and social scientific discourse, tipping points involve abrupt state changes. For some climatic tipping points, the commitment to a state change may occur abruptly, but the change itself may be rate-limited and take centuries or longer to realize. Additionally, the connection between climatic tipping points and economic losses is tenuous, though emerging empirical and process-model-based tools provide pathways for investigating it. We propose terminology to clarify the distinction between tipping points in the popular sense, the critical thresholds exhibited by climatic and social tipping elements, and economic shocks. The last may be associated with tipping elements, gradual climate change, or non-climatic triggers. We illustrate our proposed distinctions by surveying the literature on climatic tipping elements, climatically sensitive social tipping elements, and climate-economic shocks, and we propose a research agenda to advance the integrated assessment of all three.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Evidence for climate change in the satellite cloud record](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature18273.html)
___

**Abstract**:

*Clouds substantially affect Earths energy budget by reflecting solar radiation back to space and by restricting emission of thermal radiation to space1. They are perhaps the largest uncertainty in our understanding of climate change, owing to disagreement among climate models and observational datasets over what cloud changes have occurred during recent decades and will occur in response to global warming. This is because observational systems originally designed for monitoring weather have lacked sufficient stability to detect cloud changes reliably over decades unless they have been corrected to remove artefacts. Here we show that several independent, empirically corrected satellite records exhibit large-scale patterns of cloud change between the 1980s and the 2000s that are similar to those produced by model simulations of climate with recent historical external radiative forcing. Observed and simulated cloud change patterns are consistent with poleward retreat of mid-latitude storm tracks, expansion of subtropical dry zones, and increasing height of the highest cloud tops at all latitudes. The primary drivers of these cloud changes appear to be increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and a recovery from volcanic radiative cooling. These results indicate that the cloud changes most consistently predicted by global climate models are currently occurring in nature.* </TEXT>

Copy pasta from previous related comments:

Just to clarify some terminology, ice ages are periods of time when ice is present at the poles. Glacial periods are times within an ice age when the net global mass of ice increases, glacial advances. Interglacial periods are times of net global mass loss of ice or glacial retreat (then there are stadials, and interstadials, etc.). Earth entered the current ice age, which is also called "the Ice Age", ~2.58Ma (million years ago) and marks the beginning of the  Pleistocene epoch. We are still currently within an ice age... "the Ice Age" ;however, we are within an interglacial period that began ~11.7ka (thousand years ago) and marks the start of the Holocene epoch. 

Accounting for natural cycles, ignoring human emissions and other human disturbances, it has been shown that the Earth would likely enter the next glacial period in ~50ka^[1](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v529/n7585/full/nature16494.html), ^[2](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/news/press-releases/human-made-climate-change-suppresses-the-next-ice-age) . Several studies in agreement with one another have concluded that under present configurations atmospheric CO2 concentrations are required to be no more than ~240 to 280ppm to trigger the onset of another glacial period ^[3](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2004GC000891/abstract), ^[4](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-16439807) . However, as human emissions are above [400ppm](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/) and [rising](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n3/fig_tab/nclimate2148_F1.html) as was noted in the first reference, the onset of the next glacial period has already likely been postponed by ~50ka. Should humans manage to burn essentially all of the known fossil fuel reserves it has been suggested that the onset of the next glacial period would not be for another 500ka^[5](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2004GC000891/abstract) .

In summary, the Earth is on the cusp of entering a cooling phase, however, human emissions have offset this for a, relatively, long time.  </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

*It has been argued that climate change is the biggest global health threat of the 21st century. The extreme high temperatures of the summer of 2003 were associated with up to seventy thousand excess deaths across Europe. Previous studies have attributed the meteorological event to the human influence on climate, or examined the role of heat waves on human health. Here, for the first time, we explicitly quantify the role of human activity on climate and heat-related mortality in an event attribution framework, analysing both the Europe-wide temperature response in 2003, and localised responses over London and Paris. Using publicly-donated computing, we perform many thousands of climate simulations of a high-resolution regional climate model. This allows generation of a comprehensive statistical description of the 2003 event and the role of human influence within it, using the results as input to a health impact assessment model of human mortality. We find large-scale dynamical modes of atmospheric variability remain largely unchanged under anthropogenic climate change, and hence the direct thermodynamical response is mainly responsible for the increased mortality. In summer 2003, anthropogenic climate change increased the risk of heat-related mortality in Central Paris by ~70% and by ~20% in London, which experienced lower extreme heat. Out of the estimated ~315 and ~735 summer deaths attributed to the heatwave event in Greater London and Central Paris, respectively, 64 (3) deaths were attributable to anthropogenic climate change in London, and 506 (51) in Paris. Such an ability to robustly attribute specific damages to anthropogenic drivers of increased extreme heat can inform societal responses to, and responsibilities for, climate change.* </TEXT>

Obviously I don't have the time to go through, in detail, all of [Keatinge's works](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Keatinge%20WR%5BAuthor%5D cauthor=true cauthor_uid=11209660) (and I suspect nor do you, nor have you) so I can't properly state which of Keatinge's works are flawed, or incorrectly interpreted - if any; however, I suspect that Lomborg has spun them to fit his narrative as he is so often known to do... as any think tank is known to do when funded by organizations who actively promote climate science denial. 

A less controversial outlook is provided by the IPCC as follows:

...there still is insufficient European information to quantify this trade-off between heat-associated losses and gains associated with milder winters. Furthermore, the balance will vary by location and adaptive response. - [source](http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/regional/117.htm)

Keep in mind that Lomborg is comparing total seasonal deaths (Winter, ~3 months) to those incurred by extreme weather events (Heatwaves, ~2-3 days to weeks). A more reasonable, less misleading, comparison would have simply been annual projected deaths under ever increasing globally averaged temperatures. I'm quite positive that [the outlook would change](http://www.iflscience.com/environment/climate-change-could-make-middle-east-uninhabitable-no-matter-what-happens/). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Attributing human mortality during extreme heat waves to anthropogenic climate change](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/7/074006)
___

**Abstract**:

*It has been argued that climate change is the biggest global health threat of the 21st century. The extreme high temperatures of the summer of 2003 were associated with up to seventy thousand excess deaths across Europe. Previous studies have attributed the meteorological event to the human influence on climate, or examined the role of heat waves on human health. Here, for the first time, we explicitly quantify the role of human activity on climate and heat-related mortality in an event attribution framework, analysing both the Europe-wide temperature response in 2003, and localised responses over London and Paris. Using publicly-donated computing, we perform many thousands of climate simulations of a high-resolution regional climate model. This allows generation of a comprehensive statistical description of the 2003 event and the role of human influence within it, using the results as input to a health impact assessment model of human mortality. We find large-scale dynamical modes of atmospheric variability remain largely unchanged under anthropogenic climate change, and hence the direct thermodynamical response is mainly responsible for the increased mortality. In summer 2003, anthropogenic climate change increased the risk of heat-related mortality in Central Paris by ~70% and by ~20% in London, which experienced lower extreme heat. Out of the estimated ~315 and ~735 summer deaths attributed to the heatwave event in Greater London and Central Paris, respectively, 64 (3) deaths were attributable to anthropogenic climate change in London, and 506 (51) in Paris. Such an ability to robustly attribute specific damages to anthropogenic drivers of increased extreme heat can inform societal responses to, and responsibilities for, climate change.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Geologic context of recurring slope lineae in Melas and Coprates Chasmata, Mars](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015JE004991/full)
___

**Abstract**:

One of the major Mars discoveries of recent years is the existence of recurring slope lineae (RSL), which suggests that liquid water occurs on or near the surface of Mars today. These dark and narrow features emerge from steep, rocky exposures and incrementally grow, fade, and reform on a seasonal basis and are detected in images from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera. RSL are known to occur at scattered midlatitude and equatorial sites with little spatial connection to one another. One major exception is the steep, low-albedo slopes of Melas and Coprates Chasmata, in Valles Marineris where RSL are detected among diverse geologic surfaces (e.g., bedrock and talus) and landforms (e.g., inselbergs and landslides). New images show topographic changes including sediment deposition on active RSL slopes. Midwall locations in Coprates and Melas appear to have more areally extensively abundant RSL and related fans as compared with other RSL sites found on Mars. Water budget estimates for regional RSL are on the order of 10^5 to 10^6  m^3 of fluid, for depths of 10 to 100 mm, and suggest that a significant amount of near-surface water might be present. Many RSL are concentrated near local topographic highs, such as ridge crests or peaks, which is challenging to explain via groundwater or ice without a recharge mechanism. Collectively, results provide additional support for the notion that significant amounts of near-surface water can be found on Mars today and suggest that a widespread mechanism, possibly related to the atmosphere, is recharging RSL sources.* </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

*The events that followed the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011, included the loss of power and overheating at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plants, which led to extensive releases of radioactive gases, volatiles, and liquids, particularly to the coastal ocean. The fate of these radionuclides depends in large part on their oceanic geochemistry, physical processes, and biological uptake. Whereas radioactivity on land can be resampled and its distribution mapped, releases to the marine environment are harder to characterize owing to variability in ocean currents and the general challenges of sampling at sea. Five years later, it is appropriate to review what happened in terms of the sources, transport, and fate of these radionuclides in the ocean. In addition to the oceanic behavior of these contaminants, this review considers the potential health effects and societal impacts.* </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

*The 20152016 El Nio is by some measures one of the strongest on record, comparable to the 19821983 and 19971998 events that triggered widespread ecosystem change in the northeast Pacific. Here we describe impacts of the 20152016 El Nio on the California Current System (CCS) and place them in historical context using a regional ocean model and underwater glider observations. Impacts on the physical state of the CCS are weaker than expected based on tropical sea surface temperature anomalies; temperature and density fields reflect persistence of multiyear anomalies more than El Nio. While we anticipate El Nio-related impacts on spring/summer 2016 productivity to be similarly weak, their combination with preexisting anomalous conditions likely means continued low phytoplankton biomass. This study highlights the need for regional metrics of El Nio's effects and demonstrates the potential to assess these effects before the upwelling season, when altered ecosystem functioning is most apparent.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Flux transfer event observation at Saturn's dayside magnetopause by the Cassini spacecraft](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL069260/full)

**Abstract**:

*We present the first observation of a flux rope at Saturn's dayside magnetopause. This is an important result because it shows that the Saturnian magnetopause is conducive to multiple X-line reconnection and flux rope generation. Minimum variance analysis shows that the magnetic signature is consistent with a flux rope. The magnetic observations were well fitted to a constant- force-free flux rope model. The radius and magnetic flux content of the rope are estimated to be 46008300 km and 0.20.8 MWb, respectively. Cassini also observed five traveling compression regions (remote signatures of flux ropes), in the adjacent magnetosphere. The magnetic flux content is compared to other estimates of flux opening via reconnection at Saturn.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Role of ocean evaporation in California droughts and floods](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL069386/full)
___

**Abstract**:

*Since winter 2011, a record-breaking drought has occurred in California. Studies found that the drought is mainly caused by a persistent high-pressure system off the U.S. West Coast, which is linked to Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies. The water cycles associated with the droughts and floods are still not clearly understood. Here we show that the atmospheric circulation off the West Coast not only controls the atmospheric convergence and formation of precipitation but also largely determines surface wind speed, which further affects the evaporation over the eastern North Pacific, the major evaporative moisture source for California precipitation. Because of this mechanism, the ocean evaporation over the eastern North Pacific has been reduced during the recent drought. However, the ocean evaporation anomalies have little direct influence on California precipitation, especially during dry years, mainly because of their weak amplitudes. The California droughts cannot be readily attributed to the reduced ocean evaporation. The association between increased Pacific evaporation and floods over California is somewhat stronger.*

**Abstract**:

*The cause of the end-Cretaceous (KPg) mass extinction is still debated due to difficulty separating the influences of two closely timed potential causal events: eruption of the Deccan Traps volcanic province and impact of the Chicxulub meteorite. Here we combine published extinction patterns with a new clumped isotope temperature record from a hiatus-free, expanded KPg boundary section from Seymour Island, Antarctica. We document a 7.83.3 C warming synchronous with the onset of Deccan Traps volcanism and a second, smaller warming at the time of meteorite impact. Local warming may have been amplified due to simultaneous disappearance of continental or sea ice. Intra-shell variability indicates a possible reduction in seasonality after Deccan eruptions began, continuing through the meteorite event. Species extinction at Seymour Island occurred in two pulses that coincide with the two observed warming events, directly linking the end-Cretaceous extinction at this site to both volcanic and meteorite events via climate change.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Antarctic sea-ice expansion between 2000 and 2014 driven by tropical Pacific decadal climate variability](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2751.html)

**Abstract**:

*Antarctic sea-ice extent has been slowly increasing in the satellite record that began in 1979. Since the late 1990s, the increase has accelerated, but the average of all climate models shows a decline. Meanwhile, the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, an internally generated mode of climate variability, transitioned from positive to negative, with an average cooling of tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures, a slowdown of the global warming trend and a deepening of the Amundsen Sea Low near Antarctica that has contributed to regional circulation changes in the Ross Sea region and expansion of sea ice. Here we show that the negative phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation in global coupled climate models is characterized by anomalies similar to the observed sea-level pressure and near-surface 850 hPa wind changes near Antarctica since 2000 that are conducive to expanding Antarctic sea-ice extent, particularly in the Ross Sea region in all seasons, involving a deepening of the Amundsen Sea Low. These atmospheric circulation changes are shown to be mainly driven by precipitation and convective heating anomalies related to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation in the equatorial eastern Pacific, with additional contributions from convective heating anomalies in the South Pacific convergence zone and tropical Atlantic regions.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Deep time evidence for climate sensitivity increase with warming](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL069243/full)
___

**Abstract**:

*Future global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions will depend on climate feedbacks, the effect of which is expressed by climate sensitivity, the warming for a doubling of atmospheric CO2 content. It is not clear how feedbacks, sensitivity, and temperature will evolve in our warming world, but past warming events may provide insight. Here we employ paleoreconstructions and new climate-carbon model simulations in a novel framework to explore a wide scenario range for the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) carbon release and global warming event 55.8 Ma ago, a possible future warming analogue. We obtain constrained estimates of CO2 and climate sensitivity before and during the PETM and of the PETM carbon input amount and nature. Sensitivity increased from 3.35.6 to 3.76.5 K (Kelvin) into the PETM. When taken together with Last Glacial Maximum and modern estimates, this result indicates climate sensitivity increase with global warming.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Human-induced greening of the northern extratropical land surface](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3056.html)

**Abstract**:

*Significant land greening in the northern extratropical latitudes (NEL) has been documented through satellite observations during the past three decades. This enhanced vegetation growth has broad implications for surface energy, water and carbon budgets, and ecosystem services across multiple scales. Discernible human impacts on the Earths climate system have been revealed by using statistical frameworks of detectionattribution. These impacts, however, were not previously identified on the NEL greening signal, owing to the lack of long-term observational records, possible bias of satellite data, different algorithms used to calculate vegetation greenness, and the lack of suitable simulations from coupled Earth system models (ESMs). Here we have overcome these challenges to attribute recent changes in NEL vegetation activity. We used two 30-year-long remote-sensing-based leaf area index (LAI) data sets, simulations from 19 coupled ESMs with interactive vegetation, and a formal detection and attribution algorithm. Our findings reveal that the observed greening record is consistent with an assumption of anthropogenic forcings, where greenhouse gases play a dominant role, but is not consistent with simulations that include only natural forcings and internal climate variability. These results provide the first clear evidence of a discernible human fingerprint on physiological vegetation changes other than phenology and range shifts.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Human-caused Indo-Pacific warm pool expansion](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/7/e1501719)

**Abstract**:

*The Indo-Pacific warm pool (IPWP) has warmed and grown substantially during the past century. The IPWP is Earths largest region of warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs), has the highest rainfall, and is fundamental to global atmospheric circulation and hydrological cycle. The region has also experienced the worlds highest rates of sea-level rise in recent decades, indicating large increases in ocean heat content and leading to substantial impacts on small island states in the region. Previous studies have considered mechanisms for the basin-scale ocean warming, but not the causes of the observed IPWP expansion, where expansion in the Indian Ocean has far exceeded that in the Pacific Ocean. We identify human and natural contributions to the observed IPWP changes since the 1950s by comparing observations with climate model simulations using an optimal fingerprinting technique. Greenhouse gas forcing is found to be the dominant cause of the observed increases in IPWP intensity and size, whereas natural fluctuations associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation have played a smaller yet significant role. Further, we show that the shape and impact of human-induced IPWP growth could be asymmetric between the Indian and Pacific basins, the causes of which remain uncertain. Human-induced changes in the IPWP have important implications for understanding and projecting related changes in monsoonal rainfall, and frequency or intensity of tropical storms, which have profound socioeconomic consequences.* </TEXT>

That depends on the study^[1](https://ourchangingclimate.wordpress.com/2016/06/22/new-survey-of-climate-scientists-by-bray-and-von-storch-confirms-broad-consensus-on-human-causation/),[2](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002/meta;jsessionid=CF3D16937B2AEBFF2696CE56CCCCA28D.c3.iopscience.cld.iop.org) ,  though there is no question that a widely accepted consensus exists. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I noticed some portions of the Earth 101 video included portions from another video which is related to this, as it was published alongside a study, "[Record Balkan floods of 2014 linked to planetary wave resonance](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/4/e1501428)," co-authored by Rahmstorf. A descriptive, illustrated, video was published on youtube to help explain the studies findings: [Rossby waves and extreme weather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzW5Isbv2A0 ). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study: [Bright carbonate deposits as evidence of aqueous alteration on (1) Ceres](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature18290.html)

**Abstract**:

*The typically dark surface of the dwarf planet Ceres is punctuated by areas of much higher albedo, most prominently in the Occator crater. These small bright areas have been tentatively interpreted as containing a large amount of hydrated magnesium sulfate1, in contrast to the average surface, which is a mixture of low-albedo materials and magnesium phyllosilicates, ammoniated phyllosilicates and carbonates. Here we report high spatial and spectral resolution near-infrared observations of the bright areas in the Occator crater on Ceres. Spectra of these bright areas are consistent with a large amount of sodium carbonate, constituting the most concentrated known extraterrestrial occurrence of carbonate on kilometre-wide scales in the Solar System. The carbonates are mixed with a dark component and small amounts of phyllosilicates, as well as ammonium carbonate or ammonium chloride. Some of these compounds have also been detected in the plume of Saturns sixth-largest moon Enceladus. The compounds are endogenous and we propose that they are the solid residue of crystallization of brines and entrained altered solids that reached the surface from below. The heat source may have been transient (triggered by impact heating). Alternatively, internal temperatures may be above the eutectic temperature of subsurface brines, in which case fluids may exist at depth on Ceres today.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Study (open access): [Radiocarbon evidence for enhanced respired carbon storage in the Atlantic at the Last Glacial Maximum](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160627/ncomms11998/full/ncomms11998.html)


**Abstract**:

*The influence of ocean circulation changes on atmospheric CO2 hinges primarily on the ability to alter the ocean interiors respired nutrient inventory. Here we investigate the Atlantic overturning circulation at the Last Glacial Maximum and its impact on respired carbon storage using radiocarbon and stable carbon isotope data from the Brazil and Iberian Margins. The data demonstrate the existence of a shallow well-ventilated northern-sourced cell overlying a poorly ventilated, predominantly southern-sourced cell at the Last Glacial Maximum. We also find that organic carbon remineralization rates in the deep Atlantic remained broadly similar to modern, but that ventilation ages in the southern-sourced overturning cell were significantly increased. Respired carbon storage in the deep Atlantic was therefore enhanced during the last glacial period, primarily due to an increase in the residence time of carbon in the deep ocean, rather than an increase in biological carbon export.*

Study (open access): [North Atlantic Deep Water Production during the Last Glacial Maximum](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160603/ncomms11765/full/ncomms11765.html)

**Abstract**:

*Changes in deep ocean ventilation are commonly invoked as the primary cause of lower glacial atmospheric CO2. The water mass structure of the glacial deep Atlantic Ocean and the mechanism by which it may have sequestered carbon remain elusive. Here we present neodymium isotope measurements from cores throughout the Atlantic that reveal glacialinterglacial changes in water mass distributions. These results demonstrate the sustained production of North Atlantic Deep Water under glacial conditions, indicating that southern-sourced waters were not as spatially extensive during the Last Glacial Maximum as previously believed. We demonstrate that the depleted glacial 13C values in the deep Atlantic Ocean cannot be explained solely by water mass source changes. A greater amount of respired carbon, therefore, must have been stored in the abyssal Atlantic during the Last Glacial Maximum. We infer that this was achieved by a sluggish deep overturning cell, comprised of well-mixed northern- and southern-sourced waters.* </TEXT>
