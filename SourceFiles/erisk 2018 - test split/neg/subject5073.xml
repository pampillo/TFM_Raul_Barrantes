<TITLE> Reading books aloud </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-07 21:07:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I would imagine reading a book aloud would change how a story is understood and internalized compared to reading silently. For short research articles, I read them aloud just to see if what I'm reading sounds right; I tend to be much more critical of ideas when they're read aloud, instead of taking the idea for granted or glossing over it. Dramatic works or reading to your kids would make sense to read aloud, but has anybody read a book aloud just to do it? How was your reading experience? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a teacher and randomly picked up a few trade paperbacks, 2 of them being "Spider-man fights substance abuse" and "Avengers: No More Bullying."  Are there any other collections or single issues dealing with PSAs? I ask because I know other teachers who "want to use comics more in the classroom (i.e. make them more legit)" and because they'd like to have some more student engagement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm guessing there are shields like the one on Starkiller Base or tractor beams, but what prevents ships from going to light speed on planets? In Star Wars physics, would a ship just disintegrate if it tried to go light speed in an atmosphere? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The series is pretty interesting so far, but I feel like the intro is slow. Maybe a cold open would help the pacing; it's almost 30 seconds to get into the story. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Will we ever see a Star Destroyer "do something" in a movie? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-15 13:16:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Despite their iconic shape and ridiculous size, Star Destroyers have never been shown off to their true potential in the movies. The stories might not call for them, but I'm sure a Star Destroyer hovering above a city would be terrifying. If Darth Malak's Dreadnaught can do what it does in KOTOR, Star Destroyers flying around could definitely show how oppressive the Empire can be. 

* Episode III - Venators fight some of the CIS ships, but the SDs are just backdrops
* Episode IV - the most a SD ever does is catch up to Tantive IV
* Episode V - the SDs at Hoth let everyone escape, and they get ion cannon'd... the Millennium Falcon just hangs out behind one and escapes
* Episode VI - Palpy just wants them to hang out at Endor for "the trap"
* Episode VII - dead on Jakku

I hope we see them actually do stuff in Rogue One. They've never done anything to live up to their name (I guess the Death Stars didn't live up to their potential either, but at least the first one blew up Alderaan). </TEXT>

<TITLE> ELI5: Why is standardized testing so expensive? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I live in a state where all high school juniors take the ACT.

Some of my students will be taking it tomorrow. Considering tests such as ACT / SAT / SAT II / AP are usually proctored by teachers and are offered at schools (though grad and professional schools seem to offered at testing centers) and that many tests are multiple choice, why are standardized tests so expensive? I know there's research and development and grading costs for essays / written portions, but at $50ish per test ($90ish for AP) these tests seem pricey for what they are.

<TEXT> I just noticed that in a strip mall with a Target and Wal-Mart close by, the Wal-Mart lot has parking at an angle whereas Target has parking perpendicular to its lanes. They look roughly the same size. They both have cart return stations throughout.

Why the difference? </TEXT>

<TEXT> When you draft, explain your picks briefly (you do that later, but from your first few, I'd normally hit the skip draft button). You don't have to read the card name since we see it on screen, but X because it's removal. Your first pick (Echo of Medivh) you seemed indecisive, or didn't explain why you picked it over Ice Block. 

Taking a second to explain your decision making is important because that's how a viewer would know what you're thinking. It's a way that sets it apart from me playing Hearthstone. Remember, it's F2P, so you'll have to convince subscribers to watch you instead of playing it themselves, or going over to one of the bigger Hearthstone channels. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Editing out the middle actually hurts because we can't see the plays that lead to the situation you jumped to. We don't know what was already played, so we have no idea what you might topdeck.

I like the deck overview in the beginning. Keep that format, and highlight how your deck intends to win. This is a budget deck; Ragnaros is the only legendary in it; suggest improvements (You mentioned Toshley, but he's niche card. Would you suggest him over Sylvannas or Dr. Boom?)

The only things that benefit from spell power from Azure Drakes are Holy Novas, and you already have draw from Northshire Cleric, Gnomish Inventor, and PW Shield. The classic Divine Spirit + Inner Fire could work as target spells for the Gilbin or Dragonkin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Edit your opponent's turns, even if you commentate during it. You can't see their hand, and you're not at a high (low?) rank to consistently see class archetypes.

You lost your first game. It happens, but why show that off first? The point of a tempo deck is to play on curve while maintaining board control. You lose card advantage by wasting removal, which tells me you don't know how to play the deck well. You need more practice with it, and some of your commentary should point out what the opponent might do, and how you'll get around that. 

Sometimes decks don't have a good answer, but still achieve their win conditions. Your commentary was mostly play by play, which can already be seen on screen.

A decklist would also be useful to have on an overlay.

Hearthstone is F2P so you'll have to ask yourself, "Would people (who have it) rather watch me or play the game?" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Listing ingredients (and the amount) in the video description could be helpful, not only for people to quickly copy and paste shopping lists, but to search for recipes using similar ingredients.

Having info about budget, prep time, and time estimates for each step (e.g. saute for about two minutes) can also be helpful; I'm one of those people who has no clue when something is under/over/perfectly cooked.

Drinks would also be great. Thai tea and bubble tea are awesome. Is it practical to make it yourself like smoothies/milkshakes? This would be something I'd look to know.

The visuals and tips are definitely effective in making me want to cook Thai instead of just ordering out. </TEXT>
