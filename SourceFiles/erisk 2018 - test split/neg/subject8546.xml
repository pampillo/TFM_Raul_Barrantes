<TEXT> My mother, god bless her. 

**Story from 2000:** She couldn't really do anything on a computer, but wanted to send an email to her friend. I set it up and go to my room while she's typing (she two-finger types, so it took a while) and say to call me when she's ready to send it. I hear her yell "Oh no, subject8546!! I broke the computer!" I'd never heard such panic in someone's voice. The screensaver had come on (that one where the stars come at you). 

**Story from last year:** When I went to college, she finally figured out email, so she's now moderately proficient at Gmail and basically nothing else. She'd snail-mailed me a catalogue with some pages earmarked of clothes she thought I'd like. I didn't like them, but it had some others I liked. To continue the mother-daughter bonding, I emailed her back with links to them on the company's website. She replied "I'm confused. What sweater?"  I called her. Turns out she didn't know what links were. Now she knows that if something is blue and underlined, she can click on it, but she doesn't know how to make them. She just emails me enough info to google whatever she wants to show me.  </TEXT>

First year my parents had wifi, he shut the router off when he wasn't using it. I'd be upstairs in my room and I'd have to walk down to the living room and turn it on to use my laptop. Not sure if he eventually stopped (I gave him a hard time about it) or if he just started leaving it on it on when I visit. He's got an iPad and smartphone now, which have changed the way he thinks about electronics a bit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're still an undergraduate student, there will be lots of opportunity to specialize later with a master's or PhD program. In the meantime, you can narrow your focus within the framework of those classes by focusing the papers you write on science policy (for example how it's legislated in different parliamentary systems). Of course, if you're doing a politics/history degree, you'll still be studying politics/history, not science. So, if you hate those fields, you might want to consider changing directions. But if you like politics and are just looking for a way to work science in, the politics of science can be really interesting. There was a r/science AMA from someone on them just yesterday ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6974n1/science_ama_series_hi_im_matt_hourihan_and_i/)).

It's been a long time since I've found an internship, so I'm afraid I'm no help to you there, but I'm sure there are job boards out there. I'd also recommend looking directly on the websites of potential internship hosts and stopping by your university's career services office.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know this sounds crazy since you're on a tight budget, but do you tolerate quinoa? It's expensive, but I've been able to stretch it pretty far. 1/3 of a cup of dry quinoa cooks up to an amount that mixes nicely with a can of beans, for example. Cook the quinoa in bullion, season with garlic and cumin, maybe top with salsa, and you've got a nice, cheap-ish meal. Of course nutritionally, you'll only want to use that one if you're eating lots of fruits and veggies for other meals that day.

<TEXT> Can you specialize in science and research policy as you study politics? There are jobs in that at both universities and in government ministries, etc.

You might also find jobs that combine science and your skill-set in the for-profit sector (political communication for science companies, lobbying, etc.). 

Don't know much about the job prospects in science journalism, but if you're a good writer, you might look into that too. 

As you're a student, I'd advise trying these things out with internships in lots of different types of environments. That will give you a sense of how easy these fields are to break into, what you need to do to be more competitive in them, good contacts for when you graduate, and (most importantly) a sense whether you like this kind of work.

 when people are asleep or under anaesthetic, their neurons tend to fire in a more predictable way than when they are awake.

 What we find is that under each of these psychedelic compounds, this specific measure of global conscious level goes up, so it moves in the other direction. The neural activity becomes more unpredictable, said Anil Seth, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Sussex. Until now, weve only ever seen decreases compared to the baseline of the normal waking state.

I use Cronometer, and you can really easily see how close you're getting to the recommended daily values of all the nutrients. You also get a good sense of what individual foods contribute to that day's intake of a particular nutrient. Don't freak out if you're not making 100% of all your values. You probably weren't with your previous diet either.

Over time, tracking your nutrition will help you adapt your diet to fill any gaps. If there's still something you never seem to get enough of (for me it's Vitamin D), you'll know whether you should consider a supplement.   </TEXT>

If you *did* have a neighbor like me and she wanted to open up these lines of communication, would you prefer a in-person chat or a friendly note in your mailbox? I don't run into him too often, and I'd rather not ring his doorbell (since that scares the crap out of me if I'm not expecting it), so I'm leaning towards friendly note. 

Anything in particular you'd want to hear to be reassured that I'm not just sitting here thinking WTF is up with that weirdo? I don't want to be intrusive, but I can really see how acknowledging the situation might make both of us feel better about it.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Being a good neighbor to someone with PTSD </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-13 18:56:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I hope this is an appropriate place to ask these questions. If not, I apologize. 

I have a neighbor who (I'm told) has PTSD. He's a man in his 40s who lives alone. When I moved in, I heard occasional moaning coming from his apartment and honestly assumed it was sex. When some of the moaning sounded more like pain than sex, I assumed it was kinky sex. One night it got pretty crazy with the sound of things breaking, etc. 

Then, one day I ran into the older woman who lives beneath him, and she asked if I was the new tenant in my apartment and said "Oh, so you probably hear Mr. Smith sometimes." She told me he has a "psychological disturbance" (rough translation) from a trauma he experienced, and she wanted me to know so I'm not frightened (I'm a young woman living alone). She says she's trying to get him to seek help. I said thanks for letting me know. 

It's been about three months since then, and I've heard him shout once or twice, but nothing major. It's all usually at night. A few days ago, I ran into him during the day (our paths don't generally cross), and he greeted me cheerfully and wished me a nice day, etc. 

But this morning, things seemed really bad for him. He was shouting in a language I don't know and tearing up his apartment (glass breaking, knocking things over, etc.) for two hours straight. When I needed to go to work, he had opened his apartment door, walked out into the hallway, and gone back into his apartment, leaving the door open. I could see inside through my peephole that he was pacing and shouting. 

I was close to calling the police, but I hesitated, because I don't know what trauma he experience and figured it might make things even worse for him if men in uniforms suddenly show up at his door while he's in this state. While I was making up my mind, I heard him leave. 

My question is this: how can I be a good neighbor in this situation? I'd thought the police could maybe get him some treatment, but I've since found out I live in a country where the police or paramedics can't force someone to be evaluated by mental health professionals unless they're suicidal or directly threatening someone, which he's not. And since the old lady downstairs is "trying" to get him to see someone, I'm guessing he's not keen on the idea. 

Would it be intrusive for me to ask him if there's someone I can call for him in these times? Should I just pretend it never happened the next time I see him, since it's really none of my business? 

I know this is all much more awful for him than it is for me, but I was honestly rather frightened this morning, and I wonder if he could be a danger to me if I ever cross his path when he's in this state? 

I appreciate any advice anyone can offer! I don't know much about PTSD and obviously don't know if he has an official diagnosis. Just heresy from our neighbor that he's experienced a "terrible trauma." And again, if this isn't the right place for this kind of question, I apologize.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mature individuals on long forages would have the best chance of survival. If the eruption occurred during breeding season, the chicks and juvenile penguins would be trapped on the island. If parents didn't return from foraging, then the colony could collapse quite quickly. A large eruption could bury penguin chicks in abrasive and toxic ash, and any chicks or juveniles present at the time might be too young to survive in the freezing waters. Suitable nesting sites and materials to build nests can also be buried, meaning that the island could remain essentially uninhabitable for a long time afterwards.

You're of course right, but damn if that wouldn't make a pretty upsetting gentoo movie!  </TEXT>

[In experiments](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/5/1/99-0125_article), they find their way home quickly, even heading through obstacles to get back to their residences.

<TEXT> Firth says its too early to tell whether vitamin B deficiency could play a role in causing schizophrenia. Large-scale studies have implicated vitamin D deficiency, particularly neonatally, in increased schizophrenia risk. However, there is insufficient evidence on B vitamins. There is currently very little knowledge about if and how B vitamin deficiencies increase schizophrenia risk, said Firth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The authors of the study reviewed a total of 18 clinical trials, examining a total of 832 patients receiving antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia. While vitamin C and zinc seemed effective in some single trials, B vitamins stood out as beneficial across multiple studies. Currently, only B vitamins have been found to be effective on a meta-analytic level."

This is a really good illustration of why meta-analysis is important and why single studies that haven't been replicated don't always mean much on their own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for this perspective. I saw this posted in /r/science and came here to see what the neuroscientists were saying about it. As an outsider, I was shocked by how dismissive of the field Kording seems in the [first article](https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/should-neuroscientists-trust-methods-that-cant-explain-how-donkey-kong-works) I read about this a few days ago. But I guess if he has a good reputation and respect in the field, he can get away with that and people (at least some/most people) don't take it the wrong way.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, but the older generations distinction is key. I think this is really changing. They said 95% they surveyed would be happy to share. Even if in practice it's less, it could help.

I once heard one of the scientists who did research on HIV with Robert Gallo (who discovered it and developed a blood test) in the 80s say in a talk that unwillingness to collaborate among labs really slowed progress in that area. BUT, he also said he was very pleased to see a much greater spirit of cooperation in younger scientists, and that makes him optimistic. I hope he's right.  </TEXT>

Fortunately, the Robert S. Peabody Museum in Andover, MA, took excellent care of the ancient maize specimen--one of the five oldest known in the world--for decades. Wales explains that this particular cob and the DNA within it had been unusually well preserved. "Archaeological specimens frequently have high levels of bacterial DNA due to decomposition and soil contaminants," he says. "However, during genetic testing of ancient cobs, we were astonished to find that 70 percent of the DNA from the Tehuacan162 cob was from the plant!" Most other ancient samples contain less than 10 percent plant DNA.

This was the most interesting part of this to me. This sample was taken at a time when this wouldn't have been possible, but still preserved well enough to do it now that we can. Just goes to show that we have to consider future scientific advances in our work now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since some men weighed in on yesterday's [post about brogrammers](https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/542k1g/how_to_respond_to_brogrammers_who_say_i_only_get/) I was wondering how many of you are here and why you follow and/or read this subreddit. As the sidebar states, you're very welcome! Just curious about your interest, motivations, etc.

<TEXT> Account of a very cool lady of science, who traveled around the state of Maine by carriage and on foot to document plants. I'd never heard of her, but now I'm kind of fascinated. Also, some interesting details on how her legacy was preserved in a small college library and ultimately published. 

Her hope ... was that her paintings will assist the earnest student instead of serving merely to entertain the visitor

<TEXT> It's true you'd have options if they pull their financial support, but I know the burden of student loan debt can also be huge. If the nutritionist option doesn't work, you might decide that sticking it out as a "flexitarian" (heating a healthy vegetarian diet at school and whatever they eat when you go home) for four years is worth it. Either decision is legitimately and totally justifiable. 

Regardless, I'll second what others have said about talking to a counselor once you get to college. This kind of issue with controlling parents is one mental health counselors on college campuses probably have a ton of experience with, and they can help guide you through it from both a logistical and mental health standpoint. Good luck and enjoy the first week of college! Trust me, this will get easier once you're there and not under your parents' roof.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I make a really easy quinoa dish inspired by exactly the recipe for cheesy broccoli quinoa /u/elara829 recommended. I sent the recipe to my parents, because my dad's trying to eat more fiber, but doesn't like quinoa. Well, he loves this:

2/3 cup dry quinoa, 2/3 cup frozen spinach, Butter or olive oil, 2 cloves garlic (I like a lot, but use small cloves if you don't), 1/2 cup shredded gouda cheese, Lemon juice, Salt and pepper to taste

1. Rinse quinoa in mesh strainer under cold water. 
2. Put rinsed quinoa and 1 1/4 cup water in small pot on high. 
3. Once it starts boiling, turn heat to low and set timer for 15 minutes. 
4. After timer goes off, remove from burner and set aside with lid still on for 5 minutes. 

5. While quinoa is cooking, mince garlic and saut in butter or olive oil on medium heat. 
6. Before garlic browns, add frozen spinach (I think I used about 2/3 cup). Cook with lid on, stirring frequently, until it thaws and heats up.
7. Add lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste. 
8. Stir in cooked quinoa and 1/2 cup shredded gouda cheese. 

Whenever I visit my parents, we make a double recipe. I eat half as my main, and they each eat a quarter as a side with some chicken or whatever. Now, quinoa's not the cheapest thing out there and is harder to find in some areas than others, but this might be good to try as an occasional thing if your local store has it (you can also usually get it cheaper online than in a store).

Oh, and since she likes black beans, here's another super easy, one-pan [quinoa dish](http://damndelicious.net/2014/04/09/one-pan-mexican-quinoa/) I love. It might be a good one for you to try out spices with her with.

<TEXT> Yeah, you do need to be careful about not getting your money stolen by scammers. Don't wire anyone money until you've seen the flat, have a good gut feeling about the people in it, and have a signed contract. Definitely never wire money to somebody who says they're not in Berlin at the moment, etc. 

But I've never heard of anyone being robbed in person at a WG viewing. Way too risky for the crooks. With a physical location involved, the police here would be all over shutting that kind of operation down. 

Edit: When I was looking, I saw the "wg.whateverstrasse" emails all the time. Germans are weird about privacy. I'd actually say that would give me more of a sense of trusts, since scammers try to sound legit by having "real" email addresses with "real" names.  </TEXT>

Anyway, I'm moving to my own place in a bit over a month, and would like to avoid taking the problem with me. I don't have any furniture, but clothes, books, lamps, and large framed pictures. What should I do when packing to be sure the problem doesn't follow me? 

Also, once the room's empty, anything I can do besides vacuuming to take care of the issue for the person after me?

<TEXT> That's what they mean by "evidence piles up." Scientific consensus is a cumulative effect. In the case of the rapeseed study, this kind of pesticide had been shown to make three species of domestic bees sick (the only three species that can be bred in lab conditions) over the short-term. But they didn't know:

1. If it contributed to long-term population decline. The new study spans 18 years (9 years before they started using the pesticide in the UK and 9 years after), so now they know it does. 

2. If it had the same effect on wild bees. The new study looks at 62 species' populations over that period, so they can see that bees that pollinate crops with that pesticide suffer drastically more population decline. 

Edit: This [interview with the lead author](https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/increased-bee-extinction-associated-with-neonicotinoid-pesticide-use) is a nice read on the new bee study.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because the alternatives have other, more immediate consequences for the environment: 

"The reality is that a crop like oilseed rape cannot be grown without the use of pesticides. One option is to just not grow this crop anymore, which is probably not very realistic. If you continue growing it, but stop using neonicotinoids, youre going to have to switch over to something else to control pests. Because neonicotinoids are systemic, they're quite targeted. If you start applying pyrethroids as a spray, then you've got issues of drift and water contamination." </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Although the researchers caution that their study does not suggest cause and effect, they note that it does suggest that an infection, use of antibiotics or other factors that change the bodys natural collection of gut and other bacteria may individually or collectively contribute to behavioral changes in some people with mental disorders."

<TEXT> This is of great importance as, to date, no bacteria from the human body has been able to produce such compounds

I wonder if this is due to lack of looking at human sources of bacteria from which to produce antibiotics (since using bacteria from soil is apparently more common) or whether there are just so many bacteria in the human body and so much variety from human to human.

Seems to me looking at humans for the right microbes to develop antibiotics for human diseases makes a lot of sense.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> True, though improvements to infrastructure lead to more bikes on the road, which means drivers get better at driving around them (and driving around bikes gets included in drivers-ed). Also cyclists ride more safely when there's infrastructure to accommodate their needs.

Some cities have non-profits that offer free classes on how to ride more responsibly/safely, like [Bike New York](http://www.bike.nyc/education/classes/). Nowhere near the scale you're right we need. But definitely helps! </TEXT>

I had been aware of the notion that scientists don't want to challenge the leaders in their fields, and also that innovative research often appears in journals with lower impact scores (at least it always seemed that way to me), but never considered the phenomena in conjunction with each other. Surely then there are more than these two things, but other factors slowing down innovation. The flawed peer-review process? Limited actual commitment open science (beyond lip-service)?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're not wrong that that was carelessly worded. I don't really see it as critical to the core arguments, though, which center on the ways *some* states make things harder on top of that. 

I think this is intended for an international audience, since he mentions that elections are state-run and that voter registration is a thing. I read this as him explaining that election day is on a weekday (as opposed to on a Sunday, when many other countries hold elections). But yeah, you're right that that's only an issue in states without early voting. I'd be happy to scrap the whole damn system and just have everyone vote absentee!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, early voting and no-excuse absentee voting (including mail voting) are great. If they existed everywhere, this would be much less of a problem. The problem (at least in terms of the cost argument) isn't with those states, it's with the 13 others you mention. 

Every citizen gets a vote. That's how democracy works. It's not everybody in 75% of the country gets a vote, plus the people who can afford it among the remaining 25%. The 37 states you mention illustrate that it's possible and reasonable to put mechanisms in place that make it easier, not harder, for people to vote. That's what the article's calling for.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's not saying it's unreasonable to prove your residence and status, he's just saying there should be multiple ways to do it.

Let's do the math: even assuming there's no fee to get a copy of a birth certificate, marriage certificate, and ultimately license, you'd need a day for each if you're traveling to different offices that are far away. Even if they're close, maybe you can't just get an hour off work, maybe you either work a whole shift or you don't work at all. At minimum wage, that could be $60-180 in lost wages just to get your ID. Plus another $60 to miss work on election day (and then maybe the person covering for you--likely someone from the same socioeconomic group--isn't voting). Throw in the logistical challenges of getting all that done if you don't have a car? Forget it. 

But let's say you do have a car, and it was just $60 total in lost wages, spread over the time it takes to get an ID and go to the polling place on separate days, if you're living hand-to-mouth, that's probably not $60 you have to spare. $60 is a week's worth of food for your kids (maybe two). I'd chose feeding my kids over voting any day. But I shouldn't have to.  </TEXT>

"My advice to young women is to have determination and not take things personally, especially negative feedback. Know that you will make mistakes and people will call you out on them. When this happens, its easy to take it personally and let it lower your self-esteem. Criticism doesnt mean youre not a good scientist or engineer! You need to have determination: learn from it, correct it, and continue to work hard; then you will earn respect from your colleagues."

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm disappointed in Jon, and I think that's the point of the episode. As excited as we are to see Ramsay get his due, it's easy to forget that Jon fucked up big-time.

The take-away effect of BoB to me was to humanize Jon after several episodes of him coming across as unquestionably good and competent. He didn't take Sansa's warnings seriously enough. He endangered all the fighters who had his back by (rather understandably) losing his cool. He was frankly pretty overwhelmed by the battle (again, understandably so--he's still sympathetic, just more imperfect than we're used to seeing him). Davos had to improvise to make up for Jon going off-book, and Tormund kept his head much better than Jon in all the chaos. 

Yes, Sansa probably should have told Jon she'd reached out to Littlefinger. But her expression as she rides up beside him and sees the battlefield is revealing--one part worry for Jon, one part "well, this is a sorry state of affairs." Seeing our beloved warrior Jon bailed out by slimy Littlefinger is not a good look. He pulled it together towards the end and also showed a lot of strength in the episode. E.g., I thought the image Jon muddied by battle was a great foil for Ramsay and highlighted the good in Jon's character. I'm still rooting for Jon, but the episode tarnished him a bit in my eyes. But I'm also okay with that. I like GoT for it's complex, multi-dimensional characters after all.

Now that most typing is done for digital documents, most (if not all) style manuals finally changed the rules to a single space, but not in time for my high school typing class in 2003. I got away with double spacing for a long time, since my professors in college and grad school had learned it that way too. Two years ago, I finally admitted I was wrong and got with the picture, but since you don't really think when you type, the habit was hard to unlearn.  </TEXT>

I track what I eat in Cronometer (for my own reference, not my family), and was able to sit down with him last time I visited and show him that protein is actually the one thing I get more than the recommended amount of every day. Then we tracked his food for one day and saw that I actually get more vitamins and nutrients than he does (taking D and B12 supplements into account). Probably wouldn't work with all dads, but he seems much less worried now. Maybe some members of your family will respond well to the data-driven approach too if you tracked your nutrients for a week or so.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wonder how these results would differ in other countries where people Americans would call "friends" are more likely to be considered "acquaintances." Or, as the article hints at, people later in life. Outside of the classroom setting, there's less of an expectation that you be friends with the people you spend lots of time with. You might consider them "nice colleagues" or "neighbors" without immediately going to the "friend" category.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "The right to dine out in public during the day was an early victory of the women's rights movement at the turn of the 20th century... While women had long visited each other for tea and company in the home, the idea of a woman eating out at a restaurant, unaccompanied by a man, was seen as downright scandalous... (And forget about going out at night: Only women of ill-repute did that.)"

"Taking the luxurious step of brunching at a restaurant eliminated the cleanup that might fall mom's way if, say, the kids decided to make pancakes at home. But even for those women without children, brunch became a sort of public expression of women's lib. As Ternikar writes, 'By the 1960s, ladies who brunched were often the ladies who worked Monday through Friday.' The weekends were when they got to socialize and spend their hard-earned money."

<TEXT> Day-to-day, you don't really notice that they're there unless you're walking by a refugee home. But there are a lot of institutional problems [edit: by problems, I mean barriers to assimilation]. Most of the refugees living in Germany have long asylum processes ahead of them, so they're kind of in limbo and won't really be on track to integrate until they're approved (and many won't be).

There have been some serious issues with refugees [not having real access to the German healthcare system](https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/does-germany-need-to-rethink-its-policies-on-healthcare-for-refugees). 

Though of course there are some nice stories too, like a program [teaching refugees to code](http://refugeesonrails.org/en/) so they'll have job skills when they enter the labor market. And a cool program at Potsdam University [preparing refugee teachers to work in the German school system](http://www.rbb-online.de/politik/thema/fluechtlinge/brandenburg/2016/04/gefluechtete-lehrer-potsdam-fortbildung.html).  </TEXT>

Daher will ich gerne zu den englischen Podcasts, die ich regelmig hre, auch einige deutschen hinzufgen. Sanft und Sorgfltig wrde mir schon empfohlen, ist aber nicht wirklich mein Geschmack.  Deutschlandradio finde ich manchmal gut aber andererseits auch oft etwas zu seris. Was gibt es sonst fr Optionen?

Als Gegenleistung empfehle ich hier mal fr diejenigen, die sich dafr interessieren, einige englischsprachige Podcasts, die ich besonderes Unterhaltsam finde:

[Slate Podcasts](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts.html) (insb. [Political Gabfest](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/gabfest.html), [Culture Gabfest](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/culturegabfest.html), [Slate Money](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/slate_money.html))

This interview published last week offers an fascinating context in which to place yesterday's attack on the MSF-supported hospital in Syria. That attack is getting international attention, [including here on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4gtmhl/airstrike_destroys_doctors_without_borders/), so it's interesting to realize that it's just the latest of over 358 similar incidents.

There were even advertisements for fake cabinets, hollow refrigerators, and empty washing machines in which to stow away a rope baskets." </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can also just take your contract in person to the insurance provider's office. My experience with TK is that they enrolled me and gave me proof of insurance on the spot (pretty sure--if not the mailed it to me a few days later). It stated that my insurance started on my first day of employment. 

If you're from a country allowing you to be in Germany as a tourist up to 90 days, the Auslnderbehrde won't care that you don't have insurance effective immediately. They'll either give you a residence permit that's valid the day you start work, or one that's valid immediately. 

On your first day of work, your employer will ask you which of the public providers you're insured with. You tell them, and part of your paycheck automatically goes to that insurance provider. Easy peasy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really enjoyed all my MA classes at FU (more so than HU, but I have friends who say the opposite). The neighborhood is a fairly affluent suburb that's a nice escape from the city. Not much in the way of student housing there--its' mostly single-family homes. 

Most of the students live more centrally and take public transport out there. If you want a short commute and don't mind living in a quiet area, consider Steglitz. Schneberg and Tempelhof are also quiet, but more central. And all the trendier student neighborhoods are also perfectly well connected with public transport, just longer commutes (60 minutes for me in Friedrichshain).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Having taken MA classes at both, I'd also recommend HU. FU is in a beautiful, green area, but it's rather on the outskirts. If you're coming to experience the city, the very central HU will be more convenient.

I have some more outdated experience (2010) at the HU language center, which I thought was pretty good. No language course experience at FU though, so I can't compare.  </TEXT>

If you don't have proof, you can have your landlord fill out the form in the second link under "Formulare." It's basically an example of the kind of proof you need.  

De-registration is required only if you leave the country. You can send the documents by post to any of the city offices listed at the bottom of the above website.  </TEXT>
