<TEXT> I shall.  While the title sounds a little corny, well, that's where its at.  Being jaded and cynical just closes off options, and its mentally lazy (being cynical or misanthropic) because you don't have to do any work for it; everyone sucks, and thats that. You don't have to take anyone at face value, you then don't have to open yourself to being vulnerable.  Maybe I was cynical in my twenties.  That was twenty years ago. I will give it a read. </TEXT>

"Well, why didn't you say so?!" 

She had picked on them probably, too. And she had the same lunch, so I missed her by a minute. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't have a photo, because no one had portable cameras in their pockets in 1987; I was a junior in high school. Over my lunch hour, I learn that two Cadillacs have angle parked my Chevy Malibu into a non-angled spot(they were *all* non angled spots).  They formed a V around my vehicle. I couldn't move an inch.  

So, using Reverse and Drive, I literally bashed my way out as a thanks.  The Caddy on the left took the worst of it; it was driven by one of the school bullies, I won't say her name.  Maybe she's reading this. :D 

Today,  that shit would have been videoed 12 times over and probably made the news.

It felt *awesome.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> At least our weird ass experience of similar details didn't end in blood!!  1981 a stark ass naked dude showed up on the property, my SO was 13; naked guy is on the back deck, readying himself to slam a picnic bench through the sliding door, screaming for 'Grandma' to just let him in.  SO grabbed a double barrel shotgun and leveled it at the guy (universal, he finally understood what that meant) and put down the bench.  Walked up to the carport, started the hose, and washed the garbage cans.  Naked as fuck. Then took SO's moped out for a spin up and down the street while cops were called.  
Turns out he had a head full of LSD.  They found his clothes in the woods in our back yard.  Cops rolled him up in a scratchy army blanket like a burrito and tossed him into the back seat of t heir squad car.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 47, been using/abusing meth now since my early twenties.  I can honestly say that 4 day binges and psychotic episodes are days gone by, and omg I use more now than I ever have; 'high'? Its about maintenance now.  Fun?  I guess, because alternately, for example, being w/o it is like falling into a very deep well; and that hell is, well, hell.  
I feel sick almost all the fucking time now.  I have become used to it. I don't have people around me that are psychotic, either.  (We all find out who amongst us can't handle their shit at the same time).  My habit does not help diminish my PTSD.  (I'm a smoker).
   Why am I saying this?  Do I have a point?  Not really.  Just felt like jumping in.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> sounds like a good call, so far....I checked out your profile page and saw some banter about addictions   whatnot....I can't say I did it the exact same way, magick wasn't really involved, but I, within the last year, quit two habits: 16 year vicodin addiction (walked away from it and it has held) and about 10 years worth of red bull addiction, I just...quit.  When one is ready to, it can happen.  Cigs, oh god.  They've got my ass. </TEXT>

<TEXT> s'aight, note my username (lol) I ramble on sometimes...I myself prefer simpler, more traditional cards but with a twist of abstract....Karma Music and The Hermetic are my two go-to decks. I have collected definitions from nearly every deck I've come across for three decades, and of course I find it interesting to see this on video...never thought of that.   
And, MOCK READINGS!!!  they help you learn the cards and their patterns.  Notice when cards preceding/following affect the meanings...with the definitions of each card, I also include these combinations to look for....say, for example, really any 4 card (especially reversed) combined with The Chariot means stalking.  If the third card were to be the 7 of Swords, I would certainly analyze my relationships to see who is out to get me. 
Finding the definitions for combinations written down is not commonly found, but something I have found tremendously useful. </TEXT>

[not that this has been done in aforementioned post]  Domestic violence is insidious, and while you may be able to offer help, a shelter/professionals are their best bet.

<TEXT> What scares me now is my lack of fear in the moment, my lack of hesitation, lack of common sense; road rage got the better of me, and it turned out to my favor, luckily...
Driving on a detour, 10pm deserted highway between towns, my friend and I are two females alone and no cell phone between us.  A truck comes and rides my tail, a very large truck that was following so close his headlights were blinding me.  I upturned all three rearview mirrors and did everything I could to allow him to pass me, which he never did.  This went on for probably 5 minutes, its hard to tell, it felt like forever.  I was getting quite angry because his headlights were causing me problems and if this was a cop he needed to just pull me over, and he wasn't doing that.  
First thought/impulse was "That's it!!! I'm hitting the brakes *hard*!" but thought better of it, being in the middle of nowhere and no phone; the next best thing was I pulled over to the shoulder, abpruptly.  Violently, even.  
So did he.
I was so fucking angry, without thinking I throw open my driver's door and jump out, slamming it behind me.  Standing directly in the path of his headlights, I screamed at the truck "Motherfucker hopes he's a cop, real fucking fast!" and walked towards the truck. "Get the fuck outta that truck right now!"  I had no idea what I planned on doing from there.
He decides he wants none of that, and pulls away.  
I'm glad it wasn't Kurt Russell. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would have to say a great deal of famous white females have commited a great deal of moral criminal acts, hard to tally.  Because a lot of these criminal acts, in and of themselves are not illegal, just extremely distasteful.  Say the way they may treat servants or assistants; of course, I cannot site any one exact person nor headline.  And not all actresses/celebs will be guilty of this; and the stereotype is just that, a stereotype.  But those are born in truth, and I'll bet we don't know the half of it because frankly, the victims would never tell of it because of shame; the aggressors because they feel entitled. Their peers, because they feel guilt by association.  How am I doing so far? </TEXT>

<TEXT> this would land in r/unexpected, then!  People who followed the links offered were horrified afterwards; one guy was defending his sub because it was for people who like sticking objects up their bum; that at least he wasn't a rapist or pedophile.  Somehow, I assumed eyebleach was his, that I would need to bleach my eyeballs after seeing it.  Indeed, its definition is just that.  Thank goodness you don't have to look at the others beforehand.  I'm too squeamish (yet just fascinated enough to be curious, but its a fine line to have seen too much)

Well, dammit, I could swear it was in that comment thread the links I speak of.  I just scrolled through all, and ?  You'll all just have to take my word for that shit. :D  oops </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jail/prison.  Despite the fact that everyone incarcerated is where they are by some mistake like getting fucked by their lawyer or framed by the cops (lol),  they are people.  People whom society likes to forget about, people who suddenly aren't 'people' anymore, i.e.: 
Talking about someone who was convicted of murder, put away for life w/o parole: "They'll never be able to hurt anyone again."
Really?  What about the dumb kid in the cell down the way?  He's only doing a 6 month sentence for some minor thing. He's a person.  
A person who may not go home.  And the food! I only did four days once, in county lock up.  I literally didn't eat for four days, it was that fucking nasty. The Health Department doesn't get involved. If I'm wrong about that, please tell me.  
There are many more aspects of how terrifying the experience can be, and a lot of the time people who aren't criminally inclined (I don't know how/what else to call it) think along the lines of 'they are where they belong (the one incarcerated)'....until its your son or daughter, or you, even.  Don't think it couldn't happen.  Its a cowardly new world out there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I haven't drawn down the attention of established institutions upon myself by the time I'm 47, I'd say my shit is pretty well together.  And what is 'normal'?  What everyone else is that I'm not? Thank God.  We would first have to establish a baseline foundation upon which to define 'normal'.

I'll roll with having no criminal history, no medical history whatsoever (on paper).  No one in my environment has decided that it's time to arrest me or to intervene upon me; so I guess if they have a problem with my problem, it is actually a 'personal problem' they are experiencing.  That's just me being arrogant.  

And I'm not 'showing' myself to anyone who doesn't already see me.  Why on earth would anyone do that?  "Hey!! Statistician taking note of society's scourge!  You skipped me, I wouldn't want your findings to be wildly inaccurate."  The people that lend their face to being the scourge are not the 'normal' , but rather the extreme.  There are many, many more standing amongst the normal crowd watching the circus.

<TEXT> (I'm not all too concerned w/ what society thinks of me, but what the hell) I was attracted to drugs because of a couple of reasons....major reason being my anxiety disorder, or whatever you want to call it, ruled my life in the sense of a constant nagging upset stomach.  To the point it was crippling (the stomach ailment, not the anxiety) The only reprieve I have ever known was through drug use. That, and I grew up in a functional drug environment, I thought all adults did drugs when I was really young.  The stigma of it all didn't become apparent to me until I was in my teen years.  And that was when I began using.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the very early '90's, immediately following my divorce (I was 21) I wore a Sinead O'Connor head for about a year and a half to two years.  I loved it.  I am intimidating anyway, whether I mean to be or not...and I was in a very bad mood.  I felt this mood was going to last for a while.  It took care of the "beautiful young lady' bullshit which I had never subscribed to.  The few men brave enough to approach me either thought it was mega-cool, or they had balls.  That worked for me.  Everyone wanted to rub my head.  (punk rock bar patrons)

My main regret is not having documented this in a photograph.  I have been looking for one for 25 years, to no avail. (looking amongst friends and circle I hung with) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The basic premise for what I say here is very basic, and nothing is absolute, but here it goes:  I don't think drugs CREATE anything that isn't already there, waiting to be exposed.  Of all drugs, yeah, meth will bring out and show aspects of our personalities best left in the dark.  I've been on many a 5 day bender (not for 20 years, tho) and no profound changes came over me.  Expect maybe humiliation by my own self; others around me had been up just as long, so what do they know? </TEXT>

To some degree, I agree with this, given chaos being present in each and every event would have a differing set of variables. Some predictable, some quite unpredictable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> without left, right doesn't know how to fully define itself.  Polarity of opposites, its everywhere you look.  My belief is that at the point of death, the 'want' you feel will fall away, as it is an attachment of the ego, and the ego is physical.  Souls are only individual while we are alive; at the point of death, that little piece of soul rejoins a collective unconscious. What you now fret over will no longer be of concern.  

Memories are kind of a form of data, and data cannot be destroyed.  It can and will change forms.  Long after we are dead, 2 + 2 will still equal 4.  The next monkeys to start keeping track of their bananas will count 2 + 2 =4, no matter how they say it.  The data/information is still there.  The memories, they will still be somewhere, just maybe not in a way you've conceptualized.  

Conversations With God by Neale Donald Walsh is one helluva read.  It will blow your mind.  I highly recommend it.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> absolutely. sometimes, when you're trying to do something silly and get answers, like what is my crush thinking?  and the cards are vague, you'll throw 5 mock readings. they'll tell you nothing.  BUT....sometimes, you'll see a pattern in those 5 readings, that maybe doesn't make sense to you as to how to apply it to your life.  

Seven of Swords kept showing up, in all readings for myself and for two other people in 24 hours....I was explaining that the cards were ignoring everything else, and talking about this 'snitch theme'....sure enough, cops were actually knocking on her door as I was saying this to her.  Someone had snitched on her (she was a dealer).  So yeah, absolutely, that may be when messages get through the loudest.

And over time, you'll want to take notes as to the cards that enhance each other when falling next to each other....any 4 card next to The Chariot, especially reversed, can refer to being stalked.  Its loose, but worth noting when you come across them.

And when shuffling, and stray cards come flying out, leave them out. Consider them for what they are worth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, you could cleanse it in a bowl of salt, or hematite. Still in its plastic, it should ground out any scattered energies you feel it may have collected.  English, Russian, Swahili....it doesn't matter.  Traditional cards' meanings will always translate.  
To learn the deck, even if you know the cards, I have been throwing down mock readings for nearly thirty years.  It helps you to learn the cards and to see patterns as they emerge. Take notes.  Collect definitions.  Every day.
Whichever spread you feel the most natural with, I recommend starting out with the Celtic Cross spread.  
Every day. Mock readings for imaginary friends, or for real ones.  Seriously. </TEXT>

They divided the group into two or three sub groups and put us in the cells, and hit the lights.  During that time we were told about how the light did NOT come on during the guys punishment, I can't be certain but they kept them in that dark cell for a long ass time.....and there was no bed, no toilet.....just a hole in the floor like a drain.  The only light they saw was when food trays were slid through the 'mail' slot.  They told us that. They showed us that.   

we spent 45 seconds in the dark....it was an eternity.  I couldn't see my hand in front of my face at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The girl I know that was an early onset schizophrenic is my grandsons' mother, I've known her for a while now.  She has spoken to me on occasion about her childhood, and as well my son has told me of things.  She's incredibly intelligent and talented artist, she also has epilepsy. Her belief systems I would say venture into spiritual realms.  Demons, to be exact.  She was brought up in an extremely religious environment, one of which she does not subscribe to.  Whether or not it has influenced her belief systems, I don't think it did, she found this on her own at a young age.  Full blown hallucinations as a child that described her grandmother crawling along a wall, defying gravity, with eyes that glowed red.  She knew it wasn't her grandmother, she told me, because grandma's eyes did not glow red like that.....by exclusion
this must mean grandma defies gravity and crawls along walls. (She just might, lol, woman scares the bejabbers out of me)

It probably doesn't help much, thought I'd toss that in tho.

<TEXT> Are there other 'symptoms' present, like rocking back and forth? This could be, albeit rare, pediatric schizophrenia.  Especially if the sightings persist and escalate. 
http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/conditions/psychosis-schizophrenia-children-and-youth
Probably not, but this does happen in children that young.  Behavior becomes more erratic as time goes on.  

Children are more open to these paranormal experiences, I believe, as they are not bound by cultural taboos and social norms. It is probably not early onset schizophrenia, but it is something to keep in mind so as to elimination.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, there have been 3, I suspect...the main person I have experience with is now deceased.  Her life was a very troubled one.  The individual that is the obsessed fan, I have no idea, it's now been 12 years ago.  It is still something of a mystery, one that will always intrigue me.  (There is no nutshell in which to fit this, there was not a name for what people now call catfishing).  So, it is not urgent, just a point of interest.  I'm glad to have validation that I'm right, though.  I think she came too close to the 'object' of her affection, and when he didn't recognize the connection she felt, something splintered. There is so much more than just that, if you want to hear about it in more detail, I'm glad to share. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have an small expanse of woods in my back yard, a creek  that empties into the nearby river.  By the river, what as kids we called "The Clay Pits".  A brick factory that exploded at the turn of the twentieth century.  
Its the noises after dark that are stark and frightening.  Unidentified animals crying, mating, screaming?  I think one sound to be a screech owl...or screech owls feeding their young...idk, I'll get back to you on that.  
But the dark offers your imagination room to move in whatever direction it wants.
edit: NOT a screech owl, identifying this sound is going to take some time lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would call it 'The Voice on the Wind', and when they talk to you, they say little but loud.  When you listen, you'll be left with a void and a question mark.  Because whatever is was it told you not to do, you didn't....if the voices on the wind tell you not to do something, and you choose to ignore them, you won't have to wait long at all.  You'll know why immediately.  When you listen, you may never know.  And that is okay.  Not knowing sometimes is better than the knowledge of precognitive advice ignored.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Des Moines, IA, se side bottoms, Harriet and 15th...by the river bank, idk, within a football fields worth of walking along a trail that runs alongside the riverbank.  The stairs connected the woods (built upon an old landfill covered over w/ sod long enough ago that there are fully grown woods over) to the riverbank below.   The path, called 'The Highway' by locals, called 'Glass Cemetery' by others, because after a rain, broken glass from the landfill underneath sparkles to the top.  The Beach is jagged with broken glass shards, some huge. 
Is that what you meant?

<TEXT> Before I was a redditor, I had somehow come across the SaR stories, the staircases in the woods...that's about when I actually joined reddit.  It was within a few months of that, so about August of last year was my first hike into the woods after reading about stairs in woods.  I had made no mention of this to anyone.  I made no mention of it when I saw the staircase, it was along the river bank....it was about twenty feet or so between the waters edge and the woods we were walking through. 
 Its not that it was so deserted, it wasn't.  A lot of homeless folks converge in the area, and it is a fair fishing location.  Someone had hand-carved out of the earth, a perfect stairwell.  I've never before (nor since) seen a staircase in the woods.  
We walked about a mile in, and there were other oddities that day, but I had made a mental note that I wanted to closer inspect those stairs on our way back out.  I couldn't find them again.  So, I should post this over in the Glitch section too, huh? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can make plans to do that, I've wanted to do that since, because there are other oddities to photograph there as well.  You see, I looked for it on the return path that very day and couldn't find it again (doubles! glitches, 2fer) but I think it was because there were numerous distractions that day...the location, one of Des Moines' 'glass graveyards', old sodded over landfills from yesteryear, and after a rain, broken glass shards from years and years ago shimmer up from the underneath.  And, in '93, we suffered a 1,000 year flood on this river.  There  is a rusted out truck, wrapped around a tree, far far above the river bank, in the woods.  It is incredibly weird and creepy.  And the dirt stairs were perfect.    </TEXT>

funny thing, tho....the last 'nature hike' I went on I saw a staircase, in the woods, along the river bank.  It was hand scooped/carved out of earth, and connected the beach and the woods.  I had never seen a staircase of any kind in any woods.  First time after reading that, poof!  I didn't have a damn camera with me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read the article, thank you!  In the fourth yes/no spread, I do 3 piles of 13 cards in each (potentially), stopping the count in each pile if an Ace shows, upright or otherwise.  An upright Ace, a good yes, reversed, a bad yes (yes, you have cancer, for ex.) 
I have also found that when counting that many cards you are almost certain to pull at least one Ace, so I find it a little flawed.  Just thought I'd share. I love your posts! </TEXT>

<TITLE> speaking of staircases.... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-17 18:39:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In the early nineties, a bunch of us in our early twenties shared an old Victorian house, one that had been renovated into apartments after a fire had destroyed the original floor plan upstairs.  The owners did not have a copy of the original abstract, so there was no way to know exactly what was where to begin with.
I had one of the apartments upstairs, there were two staircases to choose from.  The back one was a servants passage and quite narrow, and mostly as it was in the past, pre-fire.  The main stairs in the front opened up at the top like most old ones do.  When in approach to begin descent, my feet wanted to start stepping down two-three full feet before the stairs began.  And in reverse, on the way up, my feet would want to continue to climbing.  I think the 'house' had memory (?) of where that original staircase, because I swear every time I used the stairs I would experience this weird vertigo-thing.  Not to mention when my roommates were drunk, more than one took massive tumbles down those stairs, probably starting/stopping inaccurately.  Does this make sense?  Did I explain what I'm talking about well enough?  And does this count as a 'glitch'? </TEXT>

<TEXT> that's about the year this happened, or close anyway. It would technically be the guy behind me at fault, but he had even less a pot to piss in than I.  None of us had licenses, well, I assume due to their age and lack of knowledge of any English, the kids in the Lexus not only lacked a driver license but green cards as well...they were in the most pinch of us all.  They were so pissed.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mine did shit like that too!!  I called it 'throwing a pity party'...she died a few years back, but from cancer.  Lots of suicide attempts, dating back to before I was born.  Alcoholic, too. I think she intentionally killed one of my cats, too, about sixth grade.  I asked her where Loretta was, first she told me she drove her out to the country and let her go.  Even at 12, I knew she hadn't driven 45 minutes with a yowling feline.  I called her on it, and she amended her statement to having drowned her in a sink.  At that point, I just wondered why she would even say anything like that to her kid. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A sunny, Sunday afternoon, stuck in gridlock. I have one friend with me.  It is not a usual gridlock location, so it is an out of the ordinary thing...traffic not moving.  I look into my rearview mirror and see what you never want to see, a car coming upon me w/ no indication of braking at all.  He hits me, I hit the car in front of me. Bang, bang, bang.  We all pull over into a parking lot that is conveniently located next to us.  None of us have driver's licenses (lol) and decide to jump back into traffic and act natural, before some good Samaritan calls the po-po.  Here is where I mention the car I slammed into:  It was a champagne colored brand new Lexus.  Driven by two kids, I swear to God, children, of about 14 or 15 years old.  Illegals, Mexican.  Dressed in the finest threads I've seen.  You know them when you see them.  Expensive af clothes, brand new Lexus...no English.  The girl was giving me a universal look amongst females, a look that said "Thanks.  You have any idea the shit I have to listen to now? And for how long?  You just fucked my day up."  She's barely old enough to have had a period.
   Back in traffic, still not moving an inch, my friend and I become aware of the lack of any Lexus, anywhere.  Of any color.  It was simply gone.  There was nowhere to pull off to, nowhere to go to quick paint the car.  Into a what?  A Chevy van?  There was just no Lexus anywhere.  Immediately.  
wtf I will take the question of to my grave.... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I flipped out pretty bad once, being tailgated on  a deserted two lane highway at night.  I think it was an actual predator situation, because there was absolutely no reason to ride me the way he was.  I was in a Ford Fusion, he a huge truck. After so many minutes I at first wanted to slam on my brakes and put his headlights (which were blinding me in all of my rear view mirrors) in my back seat.  I chose to whip my car off onto the shoulder and screeched to a stop.  He pulled over with me and stopped, too.  So, in my rage, I wasn't thinking too straight...I jumped out of the car,and screamed at him how he'd better be a cop, real fuckin' fast.  I walked towards the truck, into the headlights...and he decided he didn't want this after all.  Thank God.  If it had been the bad guy from Wolf Creek movies, I'da been screwed. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I apologize if this subject has already been batted around...I'm new-ish on Reddit.  Look at what evidence there is available as an m.o. would suggest:
both scenes suggested the murderer stayed a bit both before and after commiting the homicides (attic), all were hit in the head with an axe procured at the scene; both have non-family members present (2 each)(bad timing and luck for them), I haven't been able to establish any mention of oil lamp wicks being bent or mirrors being covered, the German reports (translations) bear no mention.  Any ideas?

<TEXT> And...have you come by the 'psychopath riddle'?  If you haven't....ok: a psychopath attends a funeral with her sister.  Of someone she didn't know.  She sees a man there, and falls in love with him...or her idea of love.  She does not end up meeting him.  She also can't let it go.  She ends up killing her sister as a means to an end.  What end? Why did she kill her sister?  Supposedly, if you answer correctly, you're a psychopath.   </TEXT>

Meet me at 3pm at git-n-go.
Then at 3pm, call him and say, sorry, meet me at quiktrip at 315pm.  Cops will have been devoting man hours to setting up a/v equipment to record the event, and they will be very angry and not want to switch locations at the last second.

<TEXT> how long have you been using the speed?  The longer you've been on it, the harder it will be.  
General consensus I've taken over the last quarter of a century, 2 years pass by while you couch sit and moan in dull agony.  The fog finally lifts at around the two year mark; even then, one must make himself get up and be involved in life.  But, it can be done.  It doesn't sound as if you've been on it for long enough for this to apply to you.  
I've also learned when you're done, you're done.  Emotionally, physically, if you are truly over it, there won't be a bad struggle.  I was addicted and struggled with a vicodin addiction for 16 years solid; when I quit, I 
just...quit.  Everything fell into place and it wasn't an uphill battle at all.  This is not a normal experience, but I've been able twice in my life to quit two different drugs like that. You have to be truly ready, though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd say each encounter w/ a stranger who is threatening is unique; what works with this guy may not work with another...sometimes telling your would-be perpetrator what you think he wants to hear, stalling for time, may be a good bet....if you know someone to be arriving soon that can help you; other times, 'pulling rank', as in 'I'm crazier than you are', could be a good bet.  You just have to hope whatever mask you pull out of your arsenal will be something they find frightening.  You wouldn't want such a bluff to get called.  The fact that this person is in your home uninvited, he may be easier to spook than you may think.  Act unpredictably.  If you are on a subway, or in a bar, and you feel like someone is watching you, pick your nose. Do something gross.  Play 'hard to want'. 
     Best off is to listen to your gut instincts; if someone seems off/not quite right, they probably aren't.  Don't nay-say yourself.  Better to be safe than sorry.  I'm not law enforcement, I'm just a woman in her late forties who has had her fair share of questionable encounters, and I'm glad to say that I am not prime victim real estate; I hope.

At least when I first moved in, there were a lot of places that had not been tended to or cleaned in 40 years, literally...that was when sightings and weird activity was at its most active.
     the cat has one story to contribute.  One evening she  looked at my face, then over and behind my head...and freaked the hell out.  If cats could scream like *Newt* from *Aliens*, well, she screamed like that, and took off running through the room counterclockwise (which was not arranged at all to accommodate this), finally stopping where she had started from, still looking behind me for whatever scared the shit out of her like it did. She was breathing heavy, fully dilated eyes, and could barely be soothed for hours following.  ?? </TEXT>

 **Hinterkaifeck** Murders (Unsolved), Germany, 1922....very spooky parallels between the two unsolved cases.   10 years and the Atlantic Ocean apart.
