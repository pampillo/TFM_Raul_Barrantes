<TEXT> I've ducked out of this and no longer really debate these things but I should owe you a courtesy of a response as you weren't involved in my reasons for backing off and have taken time to articulate clearly and reasonably.

I agree with you IF you care about evidence and proof. In that case you are 100% correct.

But religion and faith don't actually work like that. It's not what it's about. If, say, you have a car in your back yard for sale say, then if I want to buy it I want to see it. Not for 'proof' - I don't care about that - I just want to see:

a) it exists and you're not trying to rip me off
b) that it's something I want to buy.

Other than that I don't care. Claim what you like. 

Extending this to unicorns (as atheists seem to like them a lot and I do too) I'd say this - if you tell me you have a unicorn in the back yard then I am interested in several things:

a) are you a raving lunatic? I don't think the claim that you have a unicorn in the back yard *equates* to insanity (though most atheists seem to think this) so I rule that out first

b) if you're not crazy then I know something else: that unicorns don't exist as a physical creature - again, atheists seem to think that a belief in unicorns actually means a belief in a flesh and blood creature. They may think that (irrationally) but I don't.

Therefore I know, if we rule out insanity, that we are dealing with some sort of waking dream or hallucination. I find that interesting and find unicorns interesting in that context.

I find it quite incredible that most atheists (not you necessarily) seem to be so uninterested in the mythic, the dream world, visions etc, that they deny them to the point of believing that if someone claims to see a flying horse (say) then it means that the person MUST be claiming that flying horses exist as a living creature. 

It would be a failure of imagination, a lack of familiarity with psychological literature and a signifier of a highly irrational mind if atheists really were this literal. Unfortunately I think it's worse than that... I think they know all about dream states and hallucinations but are merely trying to score cheap points by suggesting percipients are stupid.

<TEXT> Just because someone gets pissed off means nothing. It's not the benchmark.

I get pissed off every single day with some shitbird here in BCN but it doesn't mean anything in terms of any sort of benchmark.

And another thing, probably the torches and pitchforks will come out of the shed for this one but someone has to say it: time we gave up this 'you need to integrate' BS. Wtf?

I am me and I will be me wherever I go. And I can go where I want and where is possible. If I get there and some dick is telling me to bend to his idea of how things should be or how he's set them up when it's not my way - well, that'll be one of the shitbirds I mentioned above.

We're all humans. We express ourselves how we want. 'You must integrate' really translates as 'I don't like your culture (or you) so change and do things our way'.

Bollocks to that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some questions in a purely rhetorical sense. Downvote at will.

1) Can one lampoon ISIS/DAESH? Is it allowed?

2) If not why? If so then does it matter who does the lampooning? Are only certain people allowed to do it?

3) If the lampooning IS permitted (who has this power of veto btw - bonus question) then how can one signify a member of DAESH if not by the clothes they wear?

4) If DAESH wear what the OP calls "Islamic Wear" then does this excuse them from being criticized?

5) If so then if I wear - say - trousers, then does it mean I automatically am linked to all other people who wear trousers? If someone were to lampoon someone (not me) who wore trousers would I have a legal case for a suit? Pun intended.

6) "It also pairs our beautiful religion with bombs and guns." In this case would it not be better to start a campaign to deny that DAESH use bombs and guns? That could work too.

7) "This is an act of terrorism against Muslim women" 

8) LESS THAN 4,000 SIGNATURES SO FAR - will I exceed this in downvotes?

<TEXT> Not entirely sure what the OP is about or trying to say but fwiw:

"Doors of Perception" is a quote from William Blake and an obvious reference to that. Presumably Huxley wanted to build around Blake's original idea. 

"God is not Great" is a similar case in reverse where Hitchens is trying to be amusing/clever as well as signal to his demographic in a reference to the Islamic statement of belief "God is great".

<TITLE> Need new laptop: Is new MBP overkill for me? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-23 14:59:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Time has come to buy a new laptop. I will be mobile a lot next year and have been on an iMac for last 5 years so out of the loop re Apple's laptops. 

Been looking at new MBPs obviously but heard some worrying things and then there's the price. What I need/want is this:

1) Primarily will be used for web dev and coding - BBedit/Transmit basically and running Apache on localhost.

2) A lot of writing - Scrivener and other low-intensity programs

3) needs to be 12/13"

4) ideally the screen should be far less glossy than MBPs were 5 years back as that was a real deal breaker and would always have gone for matte back then. 

5) interested in future-proofing as I'd like not to buy again for 3-4 years if poss. 

So - is it overkill? Could I get away with the latest Airs or 12" MBs?

<TEXT> Was kind of cool for the first chapters the voice of the unreliable narrator was a tad unbelievable. Spoiler alert: massive plot-hole where the 'God' character disappears in a huff in the first half, comes back all chilled (with no explanation) in the second and then at the end is back in kick-ass mode. Not very well thought out and the characterisation is very one dimensional. 

Definitely went over the top in the last chapter. Every Hollywood action-film cliche thrown in and I just didn't care about the characters. 

Overall it's not bad for a first draft but it unfortunately needs a better editor. 2 Stars.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I saw that. It's still a conundrum though because although for sure King did not sign those ones, the ones I've been offered are from the publisher and are a Limited Edition of 150 copies - kind of deluxe version.

It's vaguely possible these are SK signed I suppose, I'm trying to get more info. One thing's for sure - they are not the same copies as these at the event as they are direct from the publisher in a special version. 

In some way, in this case, it makes me think it COULD be King? </TEXT>

I am talking to you on the basis of what I read here. It's enough.

Meanwhile you're a complete tool of Russian and Assadist propaganda. 

Nope. If anything I am a complete tool of the facts. All I am saying is that the rebels are as bad as Asad and in many worse. You think that's disgusting but that says a lot more about you than it does about me. 

ISIS has absolutely nothing on the violence Assad has committed...

And there we have it....

Asad will be long dead and gone and Iran a smoking heap of rubble for years while you're still justifying Daesh. You'll just move on to "ISIS has absolutely nothing on the violence Iranian dictators meet out to their own people".

Disgusting is a loaded and emotional word. Facts are something else.

Several buses en route to evacuate ill and injured people from the besieged Syrian villages of al-Foua and Kefraya have been attacked and burned, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Syrian state media say.

Some buses, as well as Red Crescent vehicles, reached the entrance to the villages in Idlib province, which are besieged by insurgents.

The coalition of forces fighting for the Government of President Bashar al-Assad are demanding people to be allowed to leave the two villages in exchange for allowing evacuations of rebels and civilians from eastern Aleppo.

http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-18/aleppo-evacuation-resumes-buses-burned-pro-regime-villages/8130818

A report by the leading human rights organization details how extremist rebel groups have taken over large parts of major Syrian cities, in which they have created repressive theocratic regimes where critics are violently silenced and where religious and ethnic minority groups fear for their lives.....Amnesty documented abuses committed by five armed groups that have controlled parts of Aleppo and Idlib since 2012. These rebels have been supported by Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar and the U.S.

Rebel groups have established courts (the report uses the term in scare quotes) in Aleppo and Idlib based on strict interpretations of Sharia (Islamic law).

Extremist Islamist groups such as Jabhat al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham have harshly punished Syrians who disobey their theocratic laws, the report notes.

I heard and read about the government security forces torture techniques. I thought I would be safe from that now that I am living in an opposition-held area. I was wrong. I was subjected to the same torture techniques but at the hands of Jabhat al-Nusra, explained a Syrian man who was abducted by the extremist rebel group.

http://www.salon.com/2016/07/11/u_s_backed_syrian_rebels_committing_war_crimes_torture_abductions_imposing_harsh_sharia_law_report/

ABDUCTIONS, TORTURE AND SUMMARY KILLINGS UNDER ARMED GROUP RULE IN ALEPPO AND IDLEB, SYRIA

https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde24/4227/2016/en/

Maybe you think - on what basis? - that "equate Bashar Al Assad to anyone else in Syria is absolutely disgusting" and therefore don't hold these reports above to be of any worth but the people are still people being tortured and killed. 

Maybe the fact Western Governments are lying about it, covering it up and pushing the line that only Asad is 'evil' but there are people who find that even more disgusting. 

I'm one of them. To me a killer is a killer. But someone enabling and protecting one killer while pointing to another killer as the only source of evil is far, far worse. And far more dangerous. 

Who would do that? What sort of sick person?

Answer: your media and government.

<TEXT> I suppose it could be something to do with an uncritical acceptance of Western Media memes without any analytical reflection. 

Or it could be the uninformed black/white reductionist thinking that dictates that if Asad is an 'evildoer' then not only must be be the WORST baddie but those opposing him can't possibly be as bad or worse but since they are we just need to sweep that under the rug and not look at it.

Or it could even be that this card has been played so many times - Saddam in Iraq being the template - that any rational objective person must really see it is a card being played. In fact Syria is in the chaos it is *just because* that card was played. 

But for me, it is all of these and more... I'd add some hadith too in the mix if you're pinning labels on Asad. I've got some doozies too:

There will come a time for my people when there will remain nothing of the Qur'an except its outward form and nothing of Islam except its name and they will call themselves by this name even though they are the people furthest from it.

There will come a time upon the Ummat when people will recite the Qur'an, but it will not go further than their throats, (into their hearts).

In my defence all I can say is that posting about these misguided individuals who insist on giving free stuff to the homeless and elderly (!!!!! Wtf eh?) does **NOT** necessarily mean I condone this psychopathic disgrace which is clearly a brawling obscenity and should be condemned by all right-thinking people. 

I hope I can be forgiven in the fullness of time - I only wish I could be downvoted more. I have no idea whatever can have possessed me. I am thinking perhaps Djinn.

She's right about no journos on the ground.

She's right about the sources for the media info. And this is provable btw. If you see an incident happen then you can Google it and pretty much every source will use the same words. I did this the other day with the massacre of 82 people reported. 

Every result - ie all UK papers, most US - used the same words "Shot where they stood". That's not coincidence and it's not independent. 

The Asad election thing is a stretch I grant you but if you think this is not a prelude to regime change and that the West (and Israel and Saudi) is not pushing for that with this then I don't know what to say.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So the main question Im trying to ask is how is Religion and science to seperate things that cannot mix. It's just a sincere question. Am I misunderstanding you?

I don't know if you are. 

Can you prove God exists? No. Why? Because He does not want that... you can prove many other things but humans will never be able to *prove* this. 

Do you not think that if He wanted God could not have made proof possible in creation? 

He didn't. Atheists are right when they say that this can't be proved. They are wrong when they say that *everything* must be able to be proved... that's the point really. 

Belief or acceptance of God is not built on a world-view based on proof. Science has to be. You can be a scientist and a believer but you need to know where one stops and the other starts.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If it's real science it's not scary but there's a lot of Scientism these days. I avoid it like the plague. 

Religion and Science are two separate things that don't mix imo - and don't need to. If one side (religion or science) tries to co-opt the other there's a problem. 

Religion used to try to co-opt science and subsume it under one overarching umbrella. We fixed that. Now science is trying to do the same with religion.... we need to fix that too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a difficult one. I guess you know the hadith I mean right? I can't find it to quote it. Be tempted to say something Sufic/Mystical but I don't think there was such an animus against that at that early stage. 

Perhaps it is related to of the end-time prophecies which show the Umma in a very degraded state at that point?

<TEXT> Then you are writing off most early shamanic belief systems that led to the evolution of every belief system in the world today. 

Not so - as I don't accept the premise that 'early shamanic belief systems that led to the evolution of every belief system in the world today' in any way shape or form.

It's an interesting discussion the intersection of Shamanic reality and mystical reality (or just 'Reality' as I would prefer) - but I don't concede one comes from the other. 

We do not perceive reality and live in a false one. There are many ways to access the true reality and Shamanism is one such (it's by no means exclusively limited to drugs btw, there are far more techniques in Shamanism than that) as is religion or whatever. They are not the *cause* of belief systems in any way... belief systems are merely attempts to explain what the methods reveal to you.

But drugs is something else.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The 99 names are manifestations so the one you focus on is the effect you get. This is them if anyone's interested:

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_God_in_Islam

81 - the Avenger would be used for, well... is obvious.
88 - the All Rich - ditto

None of these are particularly esoteric or magical but the 100th name is. Roughly speaking no-one knows this 100th name though some people claim to... it's the equivalent of Knowledge of the HGA in some way. It's this name that gives the 'magical' power.

None of this is about djinn though, you're merely invoking and harmonising with an aspect of God. 

The Bloodline/Dynasty thing is interesting. It's not just a question of being the descendants of Muhammad but *specific* descendants. There's a hadith that Muhammad told Ali something in secret and when the other Muslims asked him what it was he told them "If I told you then you would kill me". This secret is believed to be passed down to this 'secret dynasty'.

Owning space and time is not something I've heard of them but it fits in many ways. There's lots about these people in Islamic lore and also other places. Still not much to do with djinn though.

<TEXT> Another problem with this thesis is the distinction between Allah/Yahweh and the 'old Gods'. 

"Allah" is not a name... it is just the Arabic word for God so anyone wanting to reference God in a sentence in Arabic would use it... whether they are atheist, Muslim, Jewish or Christian. It's not a name. 

So the pre-Islamic pagans used it too to signify the 'overall' God which they also believed in... they believed there was one 'top God' (ie top Allah) and the other gods were minor gods. 

This view is in the Old Testament too - where the commandment is to 'have no other gods before me' - it doesn't *deny* there are other gods. Just says that Yahweh is the top dog.

And that's the situation pretty much in the region even now (with some nuance), it's very, very common to believe in djinn which are essentially the same 'minor gods' rewritten in an Islamic context. They don't need vengeance... they've been right up there since pre-Islamic times and nothing's changed! </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a pattern here. All the ancient sites of babylon/assyria/egypt etc are either war-torn or extremely hostile. 

I don't believe that... if you look closer you'll see it's not really correct.

* Iran - is only 'hostile' in Western agitprop - many old sacred sites
* Jordan - literally hundreds of sites. Petra onwards... very important ones. No aggro.
* Turkey - ditto... only real issues in the East because of Erdogan's fascism to Kurds and Yezidis and Daesh incursions
* Syria - only recently 'hostile' and we all know why
* Iraq - ditto
* Afghanistan - more of the same. 

Actually none of these places were in turmoil before the advent of the British Empire and the continuation of those policies to the modern day.

If you doubt this then ignore the labels like 'Crusades' or "Neocons" or whatever and look at *policy* as enacted on the ground in the region. 

You'll see it has been exactly the same for 1500 years and, even if you do want to label the players, you'll see that there are only a few different ones: Roman Church - to British Empire - to US hegemony. That's just 3 main actors.  </TEXT>

Massive misogony (not exactly Islamophobia at this point) and women-hating ensued.

I tried to redress the balance but was personally attacked - example:

It's nothing but da'wah. Winning points so he can buy himself into heaven.

and then banned - not for any response I made (which were polite) but for this reason:

You are using our subreddit to push an agenda, and it isn't appreciated.

Soros/Rockafeller/ and Madeiline McCann have an extremely rare genetic defect.

Do they? Do they really? How do you know? What is 'proof' of this for you? How did you arrive at this position?

This gene, OTX2, also is responsible for the pineal gland.

Ditto. How did you arrive at this conclusion? What does 'responsible for the pineal gland' mean? It could mean many things... could you be more specific?

Recent studies showing consuming blood of young extends life.

I think you're referencing this study

https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/04/can-we-reverse-ageing-process-young-blood-older-people

Admittedly the name of the company sponsoring the experiments - Alkahest - is somewhat suspicious. BUT I think the tests are far from conclusive. 

One other thing re this - the animus behind such experiments and the assumed drive behind the 'Occult Elites' interest such thing is obviously to 'live forever' and as such is based solely on a fear of death. As is much of the New Age and futurist/self-improvement movement.

I would argue that such a thing is in direct opposition to any Occult understanding. Period. Occultism is understanding hidden laws - as in Laws. One of these laws is that you die. It's made that way. There may be something after and a large part of Occultism/Magic is familiarising oneself with those realms and finding out 'the truth' as it were. No part of it is *changing* them or trying to avoid the Law of Death. Any Occultist who tries to do this does not understand what Occultism really is.... hence these 'Occult Elites' are not Occult Elites at all (if they go this way) and know nothing. 

Look at Marina. She is 70 years old and looks 30.

That is actually an interesting and verifiable point.  </TEXT>

Beer production in Morocco was introduced by the French in the 20th century. Socit des Brasseries du Maroc is part of the Castel Group and oversees the production and distribution of beer. Popular beers include Spciale Flag (pilsner) and Stork (light lager). The Moroccan premium beer is Casablanca (also a lager), which costs more than the other two. Casablanca is also exported and, for instance, served in the Morocco pavilion at Epcot in Walt Disney World, Orlando, FL.

The breweries of Brasseries du Maroc are located in Fes, Tangier, and Casablanca, also a bottling unit exists in Marrakesh. The best selling international beer in Morocco is Heineken, which is locally brewed by Brasseries du Maroc under the supervision of Heineken International.

Following on from that it follows - again in this reading, yours may well differ - that the literal punishments referencing actual bodies (ie the traditional view of hell) are metaphorical.

<TEXT> 'God' to me is shorthand for 'something higher' and transcendent. I don't think you can 'find' God in the sense you can find, say, a lion if you go searching in Africa or wherever, but you can find answers to questions you have which are informed by the transcendent. Imo.

If you take the numinous out of the equation then there's just no point is there? This is why I said atheists might be better placed... I've met very very many religious people(esp Muslims) who have no conception of the Numinous at all. Nor do they experience it... and if they admit its existence at all they often think it's 'demonic' or whatever. This is not all people but some.

Oth I've been with atheist friends looking up into the sky at the stars and we've both been speechless with 'wow!!!!!'. Both feeling a sense of awe. I don't call this the Numinous btw but it can be a way to approach it. 

To me the signs of God are supra-normal experiences which we all get glimpses of from time to time. If you want to invoke them yourself it's definitely possible. Get a *tasbih* and say the name of Allah 1000 times morning and evening for a month. See what state that puts you in. 

You might not want to call these things 'God' and nor would I because I don't think you can actually *know* God but they are indicators of something more... and that's maybe enough. You don't need to quantify it... if you have questions there could be an answer there. 

If you don't have questions (and many religious and atheist people don't) then how can you have an answer? Some atheists who ask the question you did (I don't mean you btw) 
don't REALLY have a question.... I mean by that they're not searching for an answer as such, they are happy where they are (and why not? Fair enough!) so how can they have an answer? An answer to what?

<TEXT> Yeah but there are a few more religions than those three!

I'll bite and give you my take... will be shot down as usual on this sub but who cares!! 

I believe that God reveals teachings and paths to himself throughout history and probably most existing religions are evidence of these but - more or less - deteriorated. 

Why this happens is because people don't *really* want to travel the path to God - or rather they do, but they are not prepared to pay the price which is often the things you mention (for some people) but is more an attitude: you can pray, fast and abstain all you like and still end up in 'Hell' (not a literal place imo).

So what they do instead - one of the things - is they *change* the teaching/revelation to make it easier. They falsify it. Very obvious in Christianity but all others have it as a factor too. 

The other thing the religionists do is turn religion into a power-structure to control people. 

At this point religion no longer leads to God. Atheists are very often right about this. Christianity is not producing any Jesus's is it? Ditto Islam in our own Saints... plenty in the past but now.... not so much. 

But the thing is it *can* lead to God. So that's why I follow it. But in a different way than people who disagree with what I just said. To me, even an atheist could find God. It might even be more likely in some cases than a religious fanatic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We used to be able to interpret for ourselves though. 'aql and ijtihad used to be a thing till the people who we defer to said it wasn't. Not saying they're wrong but the grounds for saying their right can be questioned imo. 

The thing is though that one can't really argue against them now... they have defined an Islam (perhaps correctly, perhaps not) that is unquestionable.

If I quoted a hadith that they (or you) do not agree with then it would just be labelled 'misinterpreted' and 'this is why we need scholars' but all that really boils down to is this: we need the scholars to tell us the scholar's interpretations are correct.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My 2c: the most effective magician is one who is controlled by nothing and, having no desire, can have ultimate control - though paradoxically, he may not want to exert it at that stage of development.

Sex is not only one of the main and most effective influences that control and subordinate us, it is the main influence *USED* to control us. 

You can surrender to it, dive into it, even shun it - but if you do not develop the capacity to control it then it will control you.

And of course there's another factor: the clock is ticking. If you don't bring it to heel while you can then one day you will wake up old. Your view on sex and sexuality may on that day be very different than it is now and your options, desires and possibilities may be very different too.  </TEXT>

I suppose given the anti-Muslim rhetoric and the outright Islamophobia as well as the racism in a wider context - not to mention the hate-crimes engendered by the Trump campaign and victory - he/she is really being nice. Ie assuming that given the above factors no Muslim would be stupid enough, or brainwashed enough, to actually participate in their own demonisation. 

She/he is undoubtedly naive and mistaken in that, but I maintain it comes from the heart and the right place nevertheless.

Asked to confirm whether he would introduce the policy against Muslims if he won the White House he said: I would certainly implement that, absolutely.

<TEXT> It would prove what you are saying.

Yes but I like to know who I'm dealing with. 

I used to debate a lot with atheists and always was asked to 'prove' something or other. I invested many hours before I realised what a fool I was. It was never about that.

So I decided - when I saw the light - to never waste time or energy in this way again. But I felt a bit bad... maybe some people genuinely want to know the answer to something? 

So I decided I would always try to find out. If they were needing an answer or a point clarifying in order to continue the debate I would do it. If they were busy erecting an Auto-da-f and compiling a list of the next questions and possible routes of obfuscation if I came back with something I would pass.

This is why I asked. 

But you also answered - thanks for that - by this "It would prove what you are saying."

So I don't think I can be of further help. If I'm mistaken then you can always find an answer that satisfies you via Google. If I'm not then I'm doing the right thing by drawing this to a close. 

For both of us. Be well and Happy! Life is short! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Disclaimer upfront, I'm generally against the presence of Islam in the West.

Good to know going in! ;)

If people like this author and Muslims in general want to talk people like me out of having these views they have got to stop talking like this. 

I don't know about the author but no-one I know wants to convince anyone of anything. We all have the right to believe what we want... you make your choice based on what you understand. 

My only caveat would be that you should be basing them on facts. So I think one can provide people with facts but they can do with them as they please. I don't personally care what someone thinks but if they are thinking something based on an incorrect premise then they should know... same goes for me. I hope someone who can see I am wrong about an assumption let's me know. 

Islamophobia is not real, it's completely made up. To treat my concerns with the regressive aspects of Islam as an irrational fear is outrageous.

Don't agree with this. We need a word for a real phenomenon. It could be another word - I'm fine with that - but it points to something real. People could have ISISophobia. No problem. Totally understand. Extremistophobia - ditto. 

But the fact is there are some people who don't make those distinctions and their fear of legitimate threats is translated to all Muslims as a whole with no distinction. We need a word for that. Until we find a better one 'Islamophobia' works for me, made up or not.

To treat my concerns with the regressive aspects of Islam as an irrational fear is outrageous. 

Agree, if anyone is ever doing that. I would not and no-one I know would. The only people I can think who would are Daesh supporters or extremist Islamists.

But I remind you of this - you said: "I'm generally against the presence of Islam in the West."

You did not say: "I'm generally against the presence of *regressive aspects of* Islam in the West."

So that gives a certain impression, rightly or wrongly.

I tell you this because I see something ugly happening in the next 10 years. The tide of opinion has changed, and it changed quickly.

Isn't that exactly what I'm saying? Don't get this bit. I'm saying it's due to Islamophobia and racism that something very, very ugly is about to happen. Less than 10 years. Imminently. 5 Max.

It seems that you seem ok with this but you're argument is that the problem is that this ugly thing should not be labelled the result of racism or Islamophobia? I hope I've got that wrong because it's pretty chilling if so.

Westerners are extremely tolerant and caring, but at a certain point the ugly side can be awoken if our new guests continue to do shit like this.

So to paraphrase - you say when pressed you are against *regressive aspects* but you admit the possibility that if these *regressive aspects* continue to do atrocities then Westerners will take extreme action - not just against the *regressive aspects* but against everyone who is of the same religion. 

It seems to me that there are only two possibilities here:

1) you think all Muslims are *regressive aspects* and that it is not just an extremist minority

2) you think there are some *regressive aspects* which are not representative of the whole but for some reason you do not think that any 'collective punishment' is a bad thing or, for some other reason, you do not want to condemn it but instead lay the blame on the *regressive aspects* for any misfortune that will befall the *non regressive aspects*

Kind of concerning.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the considered reply. I appreciate it. I agree with you re his likely position on the alt-right but only to the extent that they are beyond the pale (for now). He had no previous problems identifying with the right in general, Republicans and Neocons. 

I think he went further than the 'ticking bomb' scenario (btw, surely this scenario, is as you point out never the case and highly unlikely) in these quotes but maybe it's just my understanding:

I am one of the few people I know of who has argued in print that torture may be an ethical necessity in our war on terror. 

His "Collateral Damage" argument:

 it seems obvious that the misapplication of torture should be far less troubling to us than collateral damage...... I believe that I have successfully argued for the use of torture in any circumstance in which we would be willing to cause collateral damage

Given what many of us believe about the exigencies of our war on terrorism, the practice of torture, in certain circumstances, would seem to be not only permissible, but necessary.

And this:

Some beliefs are so dangerous that it may be ethical to kill people for believing them.

I should say here that my argument is not with Harris per se but rather there is a deeper hypocrisy: his argument has weight and holds water in some sense (collateral damage) - I don't agree with torture but if you are not going to be 100% pacifist then his argument holds. 

The statements above would be less worrying if they were confined to a metaphysical discussion on the part of reasoned individuals of whatever ideology who have a firm grasp of complexity and nuance. However when you read Harris saying this:

**We are at war with Islam.** It may not serve our immediate foreign policy objectives for our political leaders to openly acknowledge this fact, but it is unambiguously so. It is not merely that we are at war with an otherwise peaceful religion that has been 'hijacked' by extremists. **We are at war with precisely the vision of life that is prescribed to all Muslims in the Koran.**

We have a problem.

<TEXT> Sure but he is being a lot more specific than just 'meditating'. 

The thing is that he sets out a stall which explicitly references ideas and practices rooted in Buddhist tradition. He draws on these ideas and not only engages in Buddhist practices but has personally had a number of Buddhist teachers and instructors who undoubtedly are both teachers and teachers of Buddhism specifically.

The thing with Harris is that he is - as an atheist foamingly labelled me once and I love the label - a "goal post shifting badger".

He will call for torture but when called on it will obfuscate and not own it. 

He will support (say) Dick Cheney but when it isolates some of his peers he will not own it and shifts, falling back on 'context' or some other justification. 

He does the same with Buddhism - this is all exactly what I originally highlighted that differentiates him from other more sincere and honest atheists like Dennett and Dawkins (though that latter is clearly not really a thinker in the sense Harris aspires to be). 

This is a leitmotif of the current societal right-wing tide in the Zeitgeist actually... racists are running amok in the UK and hate-crimes are rising, all racists voted for Brexit but you won't find many Brexit supporters admitting to being racist but if you discuss with them they clearly are. 

Same with Trump and the alt-right. 

It's like they're ashamed of being themselves or something. </TEXT>

For the record: I don't think he will as it is, don't think he has plans to either but I do think he will follow through with the registry and then - if another 911 or some sort of impactful catalyst were to occur - then I think he's the sort of President who might think in terms of internment.   </TEXT>

You could be right. But if it's his genuine experience then he should voice it and be free to.

I tend to think there's a lot of truth in it. There is such a thing as brainwashing and to think that only the extreme-left or extreme religious use it is perhaps naive. 

We all do it to ourselves... by consent. That's all he's saying.

<TEXT> He is not otherwise practicing Buddhism.

Well he kind of is if he's doing the practice (and it seems he is) because that's all the practice there is. But I hear you.

It's still a moot point though (imo) because in either case he has to divorce the practice from an ideology that he (presumably) cannot follow in toto.

If he does that - takes a practice and rejects 'the religion' - then it puts him again in a false position re Islam. Why could he not do the fasting and 5 prayers for example? I don't think he would because I don't think he can see any benefit there - but they are a spiritual technique as much as meditation is. 

But he includes them by default in his over-arching rejection of Islam. Why not do with Islam what he does with Buddhism - ie, reject the religion and take the benefit? Because he sees no benefit I suspect and that was my earlier point. 

In any case there was one other thing that I forgot to say earlier which you've reminded me of with this: his reading of Islam is wrong, not because it is an atheist one, but because it is essentially a Neocon one.

There are many possible criticisms of Islamic strands of thought but they need to be done in the macro as it were because Islam is not a monolithic system. But Neocons - for geopolitical reasons - needed to portray it as such... that's fine for them but for a thinker then it behoves someone rational in a considered critique to address these mistakes.

But I think it's a case of 'my enemy's enemy....' here. Fine in politics - in philosophy, not so much.

<TEXT> Hmmm, ok, I'll bite! My 2c:

I think there is a kind of irrational mindset humans can get into - essentially a mind-cancer of sorts - and the full spectrum of it leads from lumping one group together (Commies, Jews, whatever) for the purpose of demonising them without being susceptible to nuance and ends in Auschwitz (for example). It's not a progressive 'road' as it were but a condition and I'd put Sam Harris somewhere on this spectrum.

The main symptom of this condition - and anyone can have it, atheists, religionists, anyone (Islamists drawn to ideologies like those of Daesh would be another example of a more extreme sort) - is that it is irrational and self-contradictory in a way that not only is invisible to the sufferer but also *confirms* to themselves that they are right.

For example: Harris is a Buddhist. But he is also a radical materialist. 

He also, despite being a Buddhist an a Humanist, supports torture. Though seemingly only in the case of Muslims.

He also, despite being liberal (and a Buddhist) supported George Bush's war.

He also claims that when you pin down Muslims on so-called 'hate verses' they claim "context" as an excuse yet when he is taken to task for his infamous "some beliefs might justify killing the holder of the belief" statement he cites context.

Though this last one might be just ordinary hypocrisy.

He is not rational in many ways and is self-contradictory in a way other atheists aren't. That is to say if Person X is opposed to Harris's positions but also opposed actively to Islam then Person X's opposition to Islam will win out.

This is not the case with other atheists. Dennett and Dawkins seem to dislike Islam just as much but both are actively against Trump and oppose Brexit which is supported widely by Islamophobes on the basis of the immigration issue.

Massive fan of Murakami and Chandler, classic noir and Golden Age crime. Heavily into Swedish/Scandi gothic crime right now but it's nothing highbrow lol. 

Personally I think the modern novel is dead, very rare for any (Western anyway) writer to be able to put their finger on the pulse. They always seem to come from their own perspective (Safran Foer cough) when they try it. Where are the writers that explain ourselves to ourselves? I'd much rather a Dostoevsky or Knut Hamsun than most people writing today. Except maybe Stephen King or a great crime writer like Jake Arnott or Tana French.

<TEXT> I would argue it is meaningless. Even for those who think it isn't they invariably have to pare it down to different paths, methods, schools whatever. 

The only reason we can't lump 'everyday life' in with all these different (and often opposing) magical formulations is that the vast majority of people have no idea they are creating their own reality and would oppose the idea. 

The only difference between them and the 'magician' is that the magician is more aware of the possibilities. Even that's not always true as sometimes religious minded people can sometimes perform super-normal actions if they ascribe them to God.

<TEXT> Adnan can't or won't say so because he's close to getting out, or at least thinks he is.

Is this logical or rational as an argument? I think not... let's dissect it:

He *might* be close to getting out now but this is because of the podcast. For over a decade and a half he has been nowhere near getting out. 

So is this an explanation for his silence during that extended period of time? Clearly not... it cannot possibly apply. 

So what would be the reasons for him 'not saying' before the advent of Serial? Or does that not matter? I think we know the answer here...

<TEXT> Cheers, it's not a popular piece of advice I think and there's a reason for that. It is a nuclear attack on the ego. 

It all comes down to whether one thinks that 'will power' is the result of building up the ego or controlling it (I don't mean destroying it, that would be stupid!). Either you control it or it controls you... imo, if it controls you then you can't have will power but that might be just me. 

Also check out the Cynics - a magical school if ever there was one, despite not having that reputation.

* The goal of life is eudaimonia and mental clarity or lucidity () - freedom from smoke () which signified ignorance, mindlessness, folly, and conceit.
* Eudaimonia is achieved by living in accord with Nature as understood by human reason.
* Arrogance () is caused by false judgments of value, which cause negative emotions, unnatural desires, and a vicious character.
* Eudaimonia, or human flourishing, depends on self-sufficiency (), equanimity, arete, love of humanity, parrhesia and indifference to the vicissitudes of life ().[11]
* One progresses towards flourishing and clarity through ascetic practices () which help one become free from influences  such as wealth, fame, and power  that have no value in Nature. Examples include Diogenes' practice of living in a tub and walking barefoot in winter.
* A Cynic practices shamelessness or impudence () and defaces the nomos of society; the laws, customs, and social conventions which people take for granted.

Note that last point!

<TEXT> Because what some believers see in religion, many atheists are incapable of perceiving - they are colour-blind to the essence of spirituality, they just can't see it. 

In some ways they are 100% correct when they say it does not exist and is 'made up' - for them it is. Absolutely. The problems occur when they don't realise their condition and start Crusading for their Truth... which is only true for them. 

To be fair though, many 'believers' are blind to the essence of spirituality too: fundies of all kinds, Islamist extremists, US evengelicals etc.... they are drawn to a religious framework for other reasons and perhaps do not even really believe it... certainly they are not in tune with the spiritual core.

Not sure if you're Muslim but the way to get rid of any such effects for a Muslim is outlined here:

https://sarkarhealings.wordpress.com/how-to-break-black-magic/

You might not be comfortable with that but, as I say, I don't think there is any reason to think it is malicious. 

My advice would be to meditate and center yourself and be very aware for 24 hours or so. See if any good or bad things out of the ordinary happen. Try to discern things in an objective way. DON'T allow yourself to give any power to this that it doesn't have.... Just be objective and rational and test the water. </TEXT>

No, I really don't. **YOU** think that yourself and need to justify it. But you're wrong on both counts. 

It was only thanks to the out of step actions of the unlikely hero David Beckham that we were "allowed" to wave the English flag again

Oh dear. Where to start? No-one ever stopped you so 'allowed' is a misnomer. Britain First and the EDL have been waving it for over a decade. But I get the impression you probably are well aware of that.

You do not need to involve Nationalism when you so clearly have the french and Germans acting against you and your people

'So clearly' - well, if you read the Daily Mail maybe. 

it is clearly an attack by enemies.

Umm... ok.... fight them on the beaches?

Any separatist politic anywhere inevitably has a large amount of prejudice and self interest at the core, sold to the fools in the crowd as benefit to them, really just to benefit the people, friends and family of the new level of new government.

Those aren't the choices though. They are what you are *told* are the choices. 

Millions of people apparently voted for Trump as 'a kick in the teeth for the elite' but soon they will see he IS the elite. I hope. Because everyone else can see it. 

The current system is dead. We need to make new ones. We don't do that by arguing for any of the choices that currently exist whether left, right, paternalist or any other thing that you can currently see on the table. 

The thing that we need does not exist yet. We need to create it. We will be able to do that when we reject *everything* currently on the menu and stop trying one or the other.

Maybe in a FB group for plumbers or car mechanics your chances would be much higher but the question then would be: 'would I recognise an Occultist who does not advertise as being one and, if I did, would I want to even associate if they refused to discuss Occultism?' </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Occult to me is a generic term which lumps lots of things together... one of them is 'Magic' which I suspect you mean in some way? 

I can only address magic anyway as it's the only thing I have experience of in the 'Occult' rubric. 

To me it represents a refuge from increasingly dogmatic organised religion and materialistic paradigms like scientism and atheism - I feel disenfranchised from all those groups though I have a lot in common with them... it's more that they define the 'rules of admission' too rigidly and then exclude someone of my ideological stance on the basis of them. For example I believe in the teaching of Christ but hold that many 'Christians' are not in fact Christians...but they are the vast majority and have been for nearly 2000 years so I can't argue it... it's me who needs to grab my coat. Ditto with Islam though I identify as a Muslim. Still, that does not stop others labelling me as a bad one though the Islamic community is much better in this regard than the Christian one... the problem there is the non-Muslims who have some anti-Islam agenda or have misconceptions.  

Given all that, magic is to me a place where I am free to define myself and 'build my own' belief system. Ironically this is exactly what orthodox Muslims and Christians do too (and get it wrong imo) but in the magical community you are far more free as the vast majority of people are more tolerant and accepting. Not all but by far the majority. 

We're all just 'rolling our own' here and I think that's the beauty of it.

<TEXT> I have a late 2012 iMac and am thinking of getting a new MacBook Air or maybe Pro (not sure about that) - in any case I want to use the iMac as a monitor on some occasions to save me buying another monitor. I have a couple of questions:

1) Is this a viable plan for writing and occasional coding? The iMac will work satisfactorily in this way right? 

2) Assuming it does, would it be possible to use the iMac's hard drive as an external drive from the laptop while it is in use as a monitor?

3) Any other reasons why this is not (or is) a viable plan?

<TEXT> Yes... I often thought this. If you dig deeper you can see other slip-ups too.

At one point he says "I didn't kill Hae...."

The last two words of this are **KILL HAE** and the first word is "I" - if you remove 'didn't' then this is chillingly like the "I'm going to kill note" which we know is the start of a list he made planning out the murder or possibly intended to be used to taunt the cops later. 

It could even - though we'll probably never know for sure - be the first step of an attempt to get in the Guinness Book of Records for the highest number of victims murdered and got away with.... Hae being the first of a projected total of 100,000 (curiously the same number of dollars he stole from the mosque... perhaps he was mastering various forms of crime and the '100,000' was his trademark... he simply graduated from drugs to theft to murder - or maybe this is a significant number in Pakistani Muslamic lore?)

He just wasn't as clever as he thought he was. They never are. The really scary thing is though that in those days there was no internet to catch master criminals like the Golden Boy. Nowadays he'd think twice before trying this with the advances in Reddit and stuff.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree. It is very worrying. But I think the only thing we can do is to be more vocal with our own 'versions' of magic, religion, reality and strive to accept everyone else's version in the spirit of appreciating art. 

I had a bit of a revelation myself this morning when I woke up to Trumpmageddon.... it really doesn't matter if you're NOT living your destiny and putting your voice out there. Add if you ARE doing that then Trump (or whoever) doesn't matter either. We all need to just do our thing, whatever that may be, and do it more vocally and more forcefully... just choose your art form and put it out there. 

Also important is to not oppose others who are doing the same. We need to appreciate each other's vision no matter how different it is... just my 2c but I get the strong feeling those of us in tune with 'alternative realities' can't afford the luxury of division any more. 

Thanks for your thanks btw... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was pretty convinced he'd win. If you look at history it's cyclic. You can predict it if you know where you are on the cycle. Actually lots of magic in the sense of predictions works like this. 

In this case you have a certain public mood brewing in the US and Europe for years since 911. At the first opportunities it will manifest. Brexit was the first in the UK and now Trump in the US.

Next opportunity will be France. For sure the National Front will win and very likely in the Netherlands too. 

We're mapped to around 1933 - 1935 imo. Europe will descend into some form of chaos. US will stand aloof for a while but get sucked in. Maybe 10 years or so.

<TEXT> Ok, I get you. 

I tend to take a slightly different view though I agree with many of your points. It seems to me that many people have voluntarily given up their 'free will' or 'ability to reason'. I don't mean just now... all through humanity.

These people are not - imo - really brainwashed as such because they have given up using their brains. They have - if you like - surrendered control and outsourced it to their 'leader of choice' which could be a politician, an ideology, a religion or whatever. 

My take is that there is no need for any subconscious programming for these people (ie the vast majority of humanity) because they just follow the prompts. The messages in the media aren't subconscious programming - they're orders! There's nothing to program. 

Magic oth is any discipline that stands outside this. Religion, magic, spirituality etc can all be things that are essentially groups of people who don't respond to the mainstream prompts. Though of course many of these things either BECOME the mainstream prompts (US Christianity for example) or are a mere replacement (cough MAGICAL ORDERS cough).

The true magician - imo - is one who is not subject to any prompts or directives from any source whatsoever other than those he creates for himself.

<TEXT> Ok, what I mean is: what is your definition of magic?

You can't - or shouldn't - assume there is one over-arching definition and that consequently mine is the same as yours or vice versa. 

Therefore it's helpful (to me at least) if you define what yours is so I can evaluate your statement that "Subconscious programming is the very basis of magick."

For me it isn't remotely related but as I don't believe there is some absolute definition of anything - let alone magic - I'm interested in your version and what your magical perspective is.   </TEXT>

Don't think I ever mentioned the word 'mean' - a Guilter inserted that as a pejorative. I think that's probably why you don't understand.

I don't care about 'mean' - I'm more thinking like when you hear about a conspiracy and you think it could be possible so you head over to a community to check out their research and you have to back out the door slowly because they are all bat-shit crazy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's one reason why I'd go for innocence.  I should say in passing that I'd probably be leaning much more to guilt if it were not for the entirety (and I mean that - 100%) of the "Guilter Community".

It's not just that I can't bring myself to associate with them and the irrational insane toxicity which is their hallmark (though that's a part of it), it's more that when I lean to guilt, as I often do, I just have to read the leading Guilter arguments and remind myself that this is *all there is*. The Crme de la crme of the arguments. 

But I digress..... here from the OP is a summation of my current stance:

Witness with details of the crime, 

Who contradicts himself on numerous occasions to the degree we don't know exactly which scenario to believe. Sure we could cherry-pick (and the Guilters do) the one that feels best for the argument of the moment or we could just put all the conflicting scenarios in a basket (as the OP does) and call it 'a strong witness' but I'm kind of not morally, ethically and intellectually able to do it in support of a Guilty argument.

lack of an alibi, 

But for what? Which scenario? Again depends on which one you're cherry-picking and of course also necessitates **Denying** the Asia alibi and saying 'there is no alibi' which, again, bears no relation to my idea of objective assessment. So no dice here either. 

the note, 

Hahahahah

the lies 

One lie. Again, lying isn't really someone saying something you have decided on no evidence to be not true. 

The one lie about the ride is - to my mind with knowledge of the Muslim community - something I would do also. Have done more or less. There's a reason given for the lie. You can believe it or not but to leave it out is - again - not really objective. 

and contradictiond in thr files in the other sub.

Not sure what this means... seems somehow garbled but I think the above points still stand. 

I think it was Nietzsche who said (though I can't find the quote right now) something like "first comes the belief - then comes the *reason* for the belief"

I think what he meant was that humans mostly believe things based on conditioned bias - it is irrational and they know it is irrational. Because of this knowledge they strive to 'justify' it after the fact but not from assessment - the process is very different from what it would be if the process was helping them ARRIVE at truth rather than PROVE a truth.

You can see this at work every day in every atheist or religious argument for their own point of view. 

It's like if I am convinced the OP is a two-headed monopod from the planet Tharg - if he denies it then I have the proof that 'he is a liar' and this proves his part in the secret alien invasion plan.

Does anyone know whether the new MBP screens will be better than they were a few years back? Last time I used one they were far too glossy and reflective for me - to the point of being a dealbreaker. 

Oth my partner has a Macbook Air 13" and the screen on that seems liveable with and much better than the last MBPs I checked out. It's not matte but it doesn't seem that glossy or reflective either. 

Does anyone know if the upcoming release of the MBP will feature the same screen?

<TEXT> First, no need for any comments slagging-off the Paranormal as woo-woo or whatever, this is strictly business (sorry to be pre-emptive but it seems sometimes necessary!).

I've been looking at starting a blog with the aim of getting to $5k per month in 2-3 years. Subjects I've considered are fashion, politics, Men's advice etc - most of the usual suspects.

I've been thinking of going more left-field though and trying to create a niche - hence the idea of this Paranormal approach, it seems fairly popular I guess. 

Does anyone think it would be possible to monetise such a blog with ads, Amazon affiliates and even possibly sponsors?

And yet they don't. And nor do Biblical scholars. And of course I can tell your faith position from what you reply. So maybe it *does* have quite a lot to do with it. 

It's your job to support your argument and show that my position is incorrect.

Yep. And it's your 'job' to look at where I've done that instead of obfuscating by repeatedly asking me to do it in the hope it might look like I have haven't. 

In fact, it's you who disagree with what I've said. But - being a literalist - you can't just say that. Some degree of **Wrongness** must be ascribed to me. By you.

<TEXT> I don't know how you developed your labeling system, but when you use it to distract from the fact that your position isn't defensible it's easy to see it for what it is. 

It is defensible though. It's just not defensible to *YOU* and people like you - atheists and other people who think they have 'the Truth' basically.

It depends on what the benchmark is. I might think Einstein's Second Theory is not defensible - I may even have lots of clever comebacks and support from a peer group who think exactly as I do who all agree with me. 

But unfortunately, Nuclear Physicists may differ. But look on the bright side - this is Reddit! You can shout that you win and that I can't defend my position all you like! You might even convince yourself!!

Sad thing is though that it doesn't matter - at the end of it all you're just a believer. And believers are very often believers because - say it with me - *their position isn't defensible*

How about acknowledging that you had a misunderstanding of the subject.

Yeah, sometimes have to do that. This isn't one of those times. I don't even have a misunderstanding of YOUR misunderstanding. I understand where you're coming from exactly.

If you still think I'm the one who is mistaken please show me why.

If you are capable of seeing why prove that to me first. If you can then we can do something. I've already provided links and evidence you've ignored.

Are you asking me to repeat my mistake?

Otherwise, I'm sure I'll see you around.

<TEXT> Labels! The fangs come out.

Science does deal in labels it's true. It describes things and calls them other things: 'dog', 'cat' etc. It can even label ideologies and attitudes like 'literalist' and 'creationist'.

But here's the thing: if you don't like the label, it's no good foaming at the mouth about it... just don't behave like the demographic... then you won't get labelled. Quite simple. 

This is what I do. I often get labelled as a 'lunatic religionist' but then I simply show how this is not true: how I do accept facts, I am prepared to debate. How I do accept things like evolution etc. 

Of course there *IS* such a thing as a lunatic literalist religionist so I can't blame anyone for assuming I am one.... but then you know all about lunatic literalist religionism I think.

<TEXT> He's presenting himself before God, not inhabiting heaven. Coming off the street and approaching the manager of an apartment building doesn't mean you reside there, or that he would even let you.

He is in heaven. No responsible theologian has ever argued otherwise and they have even evolved arguments to explain it. They could even be correct. They don't deny it though as you do. 

Here is one such:

https://gotquestions.org/Satan-access.html

It's true that Satan doesn't get a whole lot of mention in the Old Testament, but when he does his actions are most certainly destructive and evil.

The link I gave previously gave example of where angels and King David were called 'Satan'. 

In fact, this naming is quite rare and quite late - confined mainly to the latter part of the Bible and certainly not always evil or even destructive as you say. Can provide a detailed breakdown. 

 An adversary can be in opposition to good or in opposition to evil. We see in the Old Testament that Satan attempts to thwart the good.

Actually no, he attempts to TEST and lead to the good. In Job he is an instrument of God. God is the driving force and this is explicitly stated: God *allows* him to do certain things temporarily as a test for Job. In the hope Job will come through. 

I don't see any incompatibility between the Old and New Testament's accounts of Satan.

Yeah I got that impression. But there is a lot of it and all serious theologians address the incompatibilities. You might not be a theologian - and that's fine - but you need, as a believer, to stand in relation to them as one would to a Nuclear Physicist say, you don't need to BE one or even understand it but you do need to accept that they are the ones doing the research.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The fact that God's interaction with Satan in the Book of Job isn't some sort of raging altercation doesn't mean that they aren't arch enemies.

It kind of does mean he isn't exiled from heaven though right?

Can you explain what you mean by the 'Christianising' of Satan?

Sure. Originally in the Judaic sources he was not a counterpart of God in the sense of being an evil polar opposite but rather was utilised by God (as in Job exactly) as a testing figure. The Jewish sources see Satan as an 'accuser' or 'Stumbling block' and in no way a personification of evil or even necessarily morally evil. 

This is interesting material here:

http://bethelbooks.com/wayoflife/24/

This chapter and the next one look at the references to the devil and satan in Scripture. We shall see that they are not the same thing, and that the words are used differently in the Old Testament from the way they are used in the New Testament.

And it gives interesting examples such as this:

The word satan is a Hebrew word which simply means opponent or adversary. When it occurs in the Old Testament, it is usually translated into the English word adversary.

Sometimes the adversary was an angel or a godly person. 

For example:    

an angel is described as a satan in Numbers 22:22    

David is described as a satan in 1 Samuel 29:4

None of these uses are compatible with the Christian 'Prince of Evil' locked in an ongoing Good vs Bad war with God. This is a Christian overlay onto earlier Judaic tradition. The Islamic traditions return to the Judaic sources and are more in line with the original conception.

<TEXT> Yeah, he has a different name Iblis but is more of a direct connection to the Judaic version bypassing the Christianising bits in many ways.

You've got to think the 'Christianising' aspect is not Biblical - he is a very different character in the Bible than in the dogma.

For example in the book of Job (1:6) he is actually in heaven, chatting with God. 

 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them.

 And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.

Note that reference to the 'Sons of God' too.

So what is Satan doing in heaven here? Why is God greeting him so nonchalantly and not at all like some arch-enemy or someone who is exiled. Actually they end-up making a bet of a highly dubious nature. 

Edit: got carried away - meant to say, yes, I agree with your participating in the Christian mythos point. It's exactly that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why does it matter though?

This is an Occult forum. I am not naive enough to think that implies some sort of kinship or brotherhood but it SHOULD mean something else: that we hold ourselves different to the standards of 'the normal world'. And I do. 

I don't know about you but if one is going to assume that following some Occult path is just a variation of the local 5-a-Side football on a Sunday morning then what's the point? I said what I said. Fine. You got offended. Also fine. But you know what? You don't get to put your offence on to me - because *this is an Occult forum*. If we're in some other sub maybe... but them maybe I wouldn't say it there.

I say it here because I SHOULD be able to say what I like - and so should you btw - with at least **SOME** sense that people reading have transcended the ordinary pleb in the street. That they have developed **SOME** sort of detachment and **SOME** sort of thick skin and yes, **SOME** ability to pull things back, master oneself and be in control. And some sort of insight too into why people say what they say. 

Now I am going to assume - this being a sub about what it is - that people here can do that. I am going to think you can... I'm not going to treat you like some boring soul-less cog in the machine because *YOU'RE HERE* so I owe you that. Which is why I don't owe you an apology.

I am being myself. If you want to redress the balance insult me in your worse terms and we'll be equal.

Be yourself. And don't take offence. And don't expect me to expect 'taking offence' as a value - I don't. If I did I'd join the Church or some other 'moral' institution. 

We're free. It's all good. If you need to 'get even' somehow I'll sit back for your worst insults and then we can have a laugh but I'm not worked up now and won't be then... just saying.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Scientific method was invented by Muslims though so in lands previously in the Islamic Empire there was that basis - which is another factor. You can clearly outline a backwards movement here as you can in Islamic nations generally. 

I don't think that's coincidence. 

Especially these days - look at Iraq, it's been chaos for 15 years. Leaving aside the rights and wrongs of the US invasion, if it had been rebuilt - perhaps on the Dubai model - with (say) Arab money and turned into a Leading ME city it would have taken maybe 5 years and  I can guarantee you that if any Islamist tried to mess that up the people themselves would deal with that - because they have their aspirations and something to lose.

A Reductionist Materialist could never be a magician for example and Science is often (not always) the first tool of Colonial oppressors. And, yes, those two things have a hell of a lot to do with each other.

<TEXT> I have another business which is also home-based that is my main one or else cash-flow might be a problem.

The issue is not so much the business but the publication of books which happen at certain times in the year so it is a bit feast and famine. But over the year it is generally a profit - just not regular. That's the main issue.

Another one is that certain big authors (Murakami for example) are on 2-year cycles so you could sell 3 or 4 books of his (say) for around 2000 each but it only happens every two years or so and there are very, very few authors in that bracket.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes but mostly it works out ok. I am in Europe and deal mostly with US customers because collectors there are more interested in UK first editions (which I mostly deal with) than US ones because they're rarer. Print runs are typically far far less. 

So shipping to US includes insurance mostly because US customs have some some hardcore rules about shipping. Shipping to Europe sometimes I have to take a hit on shipping to be competitive but you can sometimes build this in, depends on how hot the book is. 

EDIT: should say that in this business trust is everything so if someone knows you pack well, don't rip them off and can find good stuff in perfect conditions then you have a loyal customer and a relationship... if you can get some of these who are hardcore collectors then they will actually ask to pay more for insurance many times. I would myself when buying a book off a dealer as I sometimes do.

I have a customer who purchases a certain author who's new limited editions are always 1500+ when released minimum. They are always happy to pay 100+ shipping and insurance - which is about the rate from Europe to US. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you get the right ones. Now I just order direct from the publisher if they are doing signed editions but I used to trawl around second-hand and charity shops. You can find some gems there but is getting harder and condition is not always ok. You need to know a lot. 

Also Ebay used to be good for sleepers - there are some books that look really cheap but are not. But that's not so good now either, most people know these things.

What I tend to do now is to look at really small publishers, get sent proofs and read a lot in my genre. If you find a small publisher with a small print-run of a book that you think will go massive then buy copies - especially if you it's the author's first book... if he becomes a Rockstar in the next years then you're on a goldmine. 

Exception to this is big authors with fanatical fans: Murakami would be the main one I guess.  </TEXT>

I just order books that I know I'll be able to sell for at least 75% and which I know for sure will sell but there's no way of predicting actually when. 

Shipping is the major expense because you can't expose yourself to sending non-insured/custom-packed and signed-for on a book costing $100 or more and not everyone wants to pay higher amounts of shipping on books below 50.00 I find. Above that they do.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. I am. I sell books from home on ABE and Biblio. Sometimes used but always rare, collectible - always first editions and mostly signed. I have a niche of Hypermoderns and Limited Editions. I tried normal used books (ie not collectible) via Amazon but could not make it work. Might be different for you though. 

My advice if you're going into bookdealing at home would be to find a niche that you can get passionate and know about - learn all you can about this all the time. I'd definitely recommend looking at modern firsts though. The margins can be very high if you know what you're doing. Get a hot author signed first in mint unread condition and you're looking at 75% plus mark up straight off the bat. 

Typical Booker winner (mugs game to predict this though) if a short print run and little-known author can be bought at 20 Euros (say) and goes for maybe 100 or more. Wolf Hall I think now is 300. I bought a few of them but sold them when they were at 100. 

I know of recent books that have hit 2000 Euros or more. You really need to know what you're doing though. Happy to answer any questions. Here's an interesting link by way of illustration:

Just briefly touching on some:

-Results: yes, I have for myself. Am not sure yet how to extrapolate that to a client. Not sure how this could be proved other than relating the experience - my present work/financial state is not a result of manifesting.

I'll have a look at your site and maybe I might ask some more things. Thanks a lot for taking the time to give this considered reply.

<TITLE> Detachment </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Been reading a brilliant and very helpful PDF by /u/MoreToCome/ (not sure what it's called) where he says this:

Once you no longer truly care if your desire is met or not, you open the door to manifest whatever you wish. 

And then gives the following example:

After I received... I became attached to the money all over again out of a fear of having it run out. I tried to control it by keeping a tight grasp on it......

The interesting thing is - I had to learn to DETACH before I could receive the money AND I also had to DETACH again after I received the money (in order to be truly FREE of it). Ive realized that overcoming ones attachments is a process that continues throughout ones life. Ive also realized that it applies to everything in life (not just money).

This seems to me the key to it all and where many (or me anyway) go wrong. 

My question is this: How DO you detach? What is the process?

Anyone have any tips, hints or methods?

<TEXT> Sorry friend, but the things you are writing here explicitly contradict what your religion says. The Qur'an says that religion in Allah's eyes is only Islam and that whoever follows another religion it will not be accepted from him and they will be the losers on judgement day.

It never ceases to amaze me - I literally find it mind-blowing that we have come to a position in society where someone could even make such a statement without any self-reflection or embarrassment. **THIS** is exactly why I say what I do about atheists (and fundies) and why I will not retract it.

1) An atheist has no problem, not just telling a believer they're wrong (no problem with that) but telling them that *they do not know the facts about their own religion!* and the atheists do!

It would be as if I said that atheism demands one goes to church on Sunday and then - when corrected - feel no shame, embarrassment or need to even take it on board - I just keep repeating it and tell the atheists continually what atheism is!

2) And after all that.... they STILL get it wrong!

Those who believe in the Qur'an, and those who follow the Jewish scriptures, and the Christians and the Sabians,- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. 

Qur'an 2: 62

As a side note good for you finding a religion to convert to, however the religion you converted to does not afford the same privilege to people converting away from it, that's why ex-muslims are closeted and afraid to speak about their lack of belief.

Nope. They are afraid to speak about their lack of belief because totalitarian fundie extremists might kill them. 

This is what happens with totalitarian fundie extremists who are 100% convinced they are right and who have 'The Truth' which is why I oppose the same tendency in atheists where a similar 'we have the truth' BS prevails.

As to apostasy in the ideology and practice of the Prophet and Qur'an. Here is Sura 4:137. 

Verily, those who believed and then disbelieved, then believed and then disbelieved and increased in disbelief, never will Allah forgive them nor will He guide them to a right way.

Question: how is it possible to believe then disbelieve and then believe and disbelieve again? If your argument is correct then that wouldn't be possible. They'd disbelieve once and be dead. 

This one seems pretty self-explanatory  2:256:

There is no compulsion in religion. The truth is distinct from misguidance.

And again, to the varying races and peoples - 5:49:

To each of you God has prescribed a Law and a Way. If God would have willed, He would have made you a single people. But Gods purpose is to test you in what He has given each of you, so strive in the pursuit of virtue, and know that you will all return to God 

No record anywhere of Muhammad ordering the death of an apostate or saying it should be so and it's certainly not anywhere in the Qur'an

<TEXT> But surely if you're a Muslim you believe "There is no god but God. Muhammad is the messenger of God."? How can there be other "equal" paths for those with other gods and other prophets?

Muhammad is one of over 100,000 Prophets according to Islam. All the other religions come also from God. This just says he is 'A' Prophet. 

Allah is just the Arabic word for God - it is used in all other religions in Arabic and if you wanted to say you disbelieved in God in Arabic then Allah is the word you'd use. It's not a name.

Qur'an itself says Jews, Christians and others will 'go to paradise'.

Honestly don't see the problem here.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> How many other religions have you studied? How many Holy Books have you read?

Christianity, Gnosticism, Judaism, Qabala, Zen Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Thelema, various occult groupings.

Why did you decide Islam is the best? 

Read again. I said I did not and do not evaluate on 'best' as I believe all equal paths to God. Just depends which is the one for you. 

Did you only read the Quran or did you also study the Hadith and Sira?

All

When you found out that Islam mandates chopping hands off thieves, stoning adulterers and executing/punishing apostates, what did you think?

I thought "Holy fuck, some fundie morons will have a field day with this?!!" and laughed. I didn't realise they'd be atheists then. That came later.

What did you think about how women are treated i.e. receiving half the inheritance a man does, not being allowed to marry non-Muslims like men are, and not being allowed to marry more than one spouse like men are? 

You seem to think I'm an atheist... are you sure you realise I'm a believer?

It's like a Xian asking you "how did you feel when you realised you needed to accept Jesus as your personal saviour?"

How would you answer?

Do you think it's equality to not even give women the choice and give the burden of providing on men, while claiming that because the men are breadwinners, the womens lack of freedom is justified?

Can you sit on a chair when the chair hasn't any?

Bonus points if you know the reference without Googling!

Btw, at this point I should say don't worry, go with this... it's just fun. You already won - happy to let you win. It means so much more to you than me so you should have it! 

View the rest of this as a victory lap!

What about apostasy? The Sunni madhabs say execution is the only way and lots of material has been written on this with support from lots of big scholars. Do you reject them all and feel you understand Islam better?

I kind of see the maniacs in the religion as the same as atheists to be honest - both are kind of fucked up and both have this overwhelming need to be right - and to prove others wrong. Both are kind of stupid and irrational and both suffer from a kind of cancer that makes them stupid. 

So in Islam - yeah we have these fuckers. Hard enough to deal with them without dealing with the atheist version too.. but yeah, to me the same kind of scumbags in general. 

They both need to be opposed. It's a cancer.

How about the history of Muhammad himself? He is an eternal role model so when he does unsavory things do you think the excuse "oh well it was a different time!" is acceptable at all? Unsavory things like marrying Aisha when she was 6, ordering beheadings, engaging in banditry and raiding caravans as revenge...how about insulting polytheists and calling for their extermination while only tolerating Jews and Christians as second class dhimmi?

Well of course he didn't marry Aisha at 6. Atheists love to say this but that's why I say they are stupid and worse, liars... this is a classic example actually - let's break it down:

1) it's not true and can be proved not true from hadith

2) atheists should know this but they don't care - Strike 1

3) when you prove it to them they ignore it -  Strike 2

4) Then they lie and carry on saying it  - Strike 3.

So really, who can take them - you - seriously? You're not a researcher are you? If you don't know this then that's just lame. If you DO then you're a liar.

Does it really matter which? 

To me no... others may vary.

I think you're wrong. Read again... no matter how much it must pain you. Try to evaluate the words and think how someone - not you - might experience such a thing and describe it.

<TEXT> So, let's talk about that: how exactly did you come to the conclusion that Islam is the best religion?

I don't think it is necessarily the best. What does 'best' mean? It is part of my path at this point in my life - there's been others.

All religions are paths to God. Or paths away from God.. depends on the attitude of the person.  So is atheism by the same token. 

I don't really go by what's 'best' as they're all true. Better to ask if the believer themselves is 'true' - far more informative. If they are then it's ok... if not then there'll be trouble.

I think you mean how did I find it? Brought up Evangelical Xian, didn't see any coherent logic in that but still had experiences of "something else" which I didn't feel any need to fit into any bracket... later when I read about Islam I realised it was more or less what I already believed so was not really any transition at all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> please enlighten me.

I don't think that's possible. The journey to enlightenment can only begin (and end) with the individual. You'll have to find your own way there... or not.

Also please respond to my post. Would you try to convince your dying friend his delusions were exactly that - delusions. Would you cause your friend incredible pain for no gain?

I would never - not there and not here either - set myself up to be the arbiter of what is delusion. If I want that I know of many Fundie mosques I can go to and listen to how they alone 'have the truth' - and if that makes me lose my faith I could become a certain type of atheist and believe the same thing. 

So, no, I don't know what delusion is, I am not the judge of it and more, I actually think your non-belief is fine for you. You're 100% right in all your views - for you.

And I am 100% right in living my life in a way that precludes me ever telling you you're wrong, delusional or in error (might say irrational though lol). 

So no. Would say to my dying friend 'you're 100% right'. I'd say the same to you btw actually if I happened to be at your deathbed - and it would be true in both cases. In my opinion.

Yours will differ and that's fine too.

Because the cool atheists I meet here remind me they are not all assholes and that humans are basically good and we CAN make a connection even if it is only 1 person in 100. 

Because there are so many fundie idiots in religion and atheism these days (it is, as you say about religion, a Cancer) that I need reminding constantly that not all are like that. I don't need it from the religious side as I am religious and all my friends are cool but I DO need reminding from the atheist side from time to time.

Because those 1 in 100 that I meet are worth so much more than the other 99 and many become ongoing friends I can discuss and have great exchanges with elsewhere.

God tells them they will die if they eat the fruit. The serpent (nowhere identified with Satan) tells them this is not true and they will not. 

It turns out that it was the serpent telling the truth and God who was lying. Not sure anyone can see a way round this. 

Other problems for literalists:

* Tree is 'knowledge of good and evil' - why is this a bad thing? It isn't saying evil doesn't exist at this point... just that KNOWING that is bad. See next point too.

* If they were naked before eating the fruit and that was no problem why would it be a problem after? Surely the problem after that they only THOUGHT nakedness was wrong and this, in itself, must be a wrong thought as they were naked before and it was ok. 

* Snake is cursed to crawl on his belly thereafter. What did he do before? He was a snake... it's what they do. 

* Who were the other people in the other lands mentioned when Cain was exiled? At this point there is only Adam, Eve and Cain in existence?

Richard Burton was Welsh I think (the actor) but it's not him. This one is the famous Arabist and linguist. 

English explorer, geographer, translator, writer, soldier, orientalist, cartographer, ethnologist, spy, linguist, poet, fencer, and diplomat. He was famed for his travels and explorations in Asia, Africa and the Americas, as well as his extraordinary knowledge of languages and cultures. According to one count, he spoke 29 European, Asian and African languages.

<TEXT> Building on the idea that you need to form the desire, focus on it and 'let it go' into the universe, I've been experimenting with various forms of tech to help with this. 

So far results have been spotty but I am still tweaking the system. So far I've tried Lucid Dream devices and Binaural Beats (both don't work as far as I can tell), Float Tanks (some limited success) and Hypnagogic Light Machines, one in particular.

My method is this: 

* Decide on desire for testing purposes - something trivial "Will see Yellow Butterfly" or whatever
* Meditate briefly on desire to 'fix' in place
* Have a session on the device keeping the desire in mind and at culmination of the experience 'let it go' consciously and say goodbye to it.

Early days yet but some encouraging results. I'm trying to get something replicable and statistically significant - at least to me.

Anyone else tried anything like this? </TEXT>

They spend their lives wittering on about 'Truth' and how we need to actually be loyal to it while berating anyone who believes interminably while they have **NO PROOF**

When the postulate is that they **HAVE PROOF** they decide to shut up!

<TEXT> Yes unfortunately you are right...Or maybe it has to be accepted...No way to persuade them. After all, if people fight about non-issues it is probably blocking them form causing more harm around real problems.

The thing we need to realise - and I think most sane rational people do - is that the closed-minded atheists and the closed-minded religionists are the same thing. They both are convinced they are right and can't assess any other factors than those that support their world-view.

The 'Truth' in a spiritual sense (and religion is by no means always the same thing) is something quite other than belief or doubt or proof.

I can only quote Khayyam:

Some look for truth in creeds, and forms, and rules;   

Some grope for doubts or dogmas in the schools;    

But from behind the veil a voice proclaims,    

"Your road lies neither here nor there, O fools. "

Or perhaps Richard Burton:

All Faith is false, all Faith is true:   

Truth is the shattered mirror strown   

In myriad bits; while each believes   

His little bit the whole to own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can't speak to the others but can comment on the Sufism aspect.

It's true to a certain extent. In some Orders there are stages one achieves via exercises, interaction with the Sheikh etc which are connecting with one's "Inner Jesus", "Inner Moses", "Inner Muhammad" etc. 

They are not sequential or hierarchical but states of being one 'stands in' when you reach that point. The figure of the person in the 'real world' is an archetype of a certain attitude.

Moses leads out of long-term exile, Jesus is compassion and forgiveness, Muhammad resists and fights against overwhelming odds etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is for first generation converts only. If you are born into a Muslim family then I have no problems believing that you can have genuine religious experiences.

I was not born into a Muslim family. Far from it. I had never heard of Islam or knew anything about it when I had certain religious experiences that did not fit into any framework I knew of. Later when I encountered Islam I saw they fitted into that framework.

But at the same time - religious people refuse to believe that people fall out of religion.

I don't deny that. Happens all the time. I know people it's happened to.

Religious people think that apostates and deserters must have an ulterior motive.

Again, no. I have observed several cases of this and can explain it to my own satisfaction. 

I'll give you an example in reverse to illustrate my point. When I first left school and went to college I was in an 'atheist' period. I wanted to be one, was heavily into nihilism, existentialism and stuff but still could not rid of myself of what you might call 'religious experiences' and perception of the existence of God. I reframed this in a drug-subculture context and basically took huge amounts of drugs for a couple of years. My partner in crime was the college Rock Star who was kind of a mentor to me - introduced me to the coolest books, music, people etc. We went to some amazing gigs and hung out. Went to India and Middle East looking for gurus etc. 

Later, after college I heard he'd not only become a born-again Christian (this is not a surprising trajectory btw) but he was a Pastor with a huge Church. Here's the kicker... I am religious myself, I sought him out (not with my Muslim hat on) and guess what? He is not only not in the least remotely like the person I knew - not even half the person, he's a boring conservative with no fire - he is not remotely interested in concepts of God, religion, philosophy etc.

This a person who when he was an atheist I would stay up with all night discussing whether God existed. Now he is not even interested in telling me he thinks God does. 

My point is this: when he was an atheist before he had life, passion and fire. If he were to become one tomorrrow *he would be no different than he is today* except he would have no faith. 

De-conversion is just (imo) the final admission you have nothing. But that does not mean there IS nothing.

I know many practicing religious people right now this moment who are 'atheists'. They certainly have no religious impulse or experience - though probably it is not for me to judge it. 

How can they desert God when they have already experienced him? 

As above.... they never did. Some do, some don't.... it's actually quite rare. I'd even agree with you if you said 90%+ of religious people don't and you then levelled the usual criticisms atheists have AT that 90%+. 

I just can't agree with the 100% figure and that seems non-negotiable in these discussions... that's the nub of it.

So a belief in God may come from 'elsewhere' and therefore not be within the parameters of the research. It could, in fact, not apply in the case of God and beliefs relating to God and therefore religion.

<TEXT> I don't really agree with this research - not just because many highly analytical people believe in God but because this:

They do the opposite when thinking about the physical world, according to the study.

I actually don't. I can't know what anyone else does but for me, there is no compartmentalisation like that. The thought processes of thinking about anything are the same more or less. That's not strictly true as the feeling of belief in God is not (for me) subject to all of the same assessments, it just 'is' but in the way other things 'just are' - sense of self for example.

I een tried to be an atheist once, I was quite into it and heavily invested enough to read everything Nietzsche ever wrote (still love him) but nothing has ever shifted that perception of 'God'. 

Which could be something else of course - but it's not in the normal run of things so why not?

The fact that there *could* be massacres is indicative of the pluralistic society. Not that they are a good thing but in the sense that if there is prejudice now in the US against Muslims (say) that is because it is human nature as you point out, and the fact that the US is a multicultural society. 

These things, unfortunately happen in multicultural societies and will probably go on happening. They don't happen in monocultural societies because there is a monoculture. 

I don't deny these happenings - I just dispute they are evidence of an Islamic attempt at monoculture. </TEXT>

No you disagree with me. 

Just gave you some reasons against it. But you're not going to address them are you?

This is exactly what happened to Jews in the early part of the spread of Islam. Many converted because they would otherwise be second-class citizens or even exiled from their homes!

Reference?

Why would they need to do this if the Charter of Medina prohibited this?

<TEXT> I agree. But my point is that this does not work within an Islamic context.

Do you think this template above was also used by Islam?

If so then you need to address how they circumnavigated these issues:

1) The injunction against converting Jews, Christians and others

2) The non-necessity of doing so in a theological sense as these groups are held to be believers. In other words they're going to heaven - what else is there to do?

If they DID get round those two factors we need to address these two issues:

3) How exactly did they do it?

4) Did it fail? It must have done as their are very large non-Muslim communities in all countries in the Islamic Empire. 

5) How can we explain #4 (ie 1400 years of non-Muslim communities) in the light of your template above. It does not seem to fit.. clearly NO further generations converted.

<TEXT> Ok, fair enough. I don't recognise 'what Arabs did to pagans' any more than I recognise 'what US did to Shintoists' in Japan in WW2 (actually most of the victims of the US there were Christians oddly but you get my point I hope).

It wasn't a question of trying to convert pagans. It was a question of Muhammad calling on them to convert if they wanted to. Qur'an is pretty clear "No compulsion in religion", no forced conversion and if people want to reject the Message they can do what they like and God will judge.

Not as a result of this call - but for other political and financial reasons - pagans and Muslims ended up at war. 

So 'what Arabs did to pagans' does not really matter in the context of this argument as it had nothing to do with the spread of Islam - particularly as it happened before any Empire-building and in the home city of the tribes involved. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The fact that there are still minority communities in the Islamic world doesn't mean the Islamic world didn't spread by force. Did they not conquer the territory in the first place, and establish Islamic dominance?

Well that's different. If your argument is that the *Religion* was spread by force then my previous counter-arguments apply.

If you are instead arguing, as you seem to be above, that the *Civilisation* (you won't like that word but work with me for a bit) spread that way then I would ask you this:

1) How is that different to every other Civilisation or Empire that ever existed? It's kind of how they spread.

2) Do you have an example of an Empire or Civilisation that DID NOT spread this way?

3) Are you against all such Empires and would you criticise them all in the same way? If not then why single out Islam? (If you say 'religion' here we're back to Square 1 and my counter-points, yes, this is a Flow-Chart)

I'm not arguing Muslims went door to door forcing conversions.

Seems very clear then you're arguing against the normal mode that Empires are formed by then yes? You're basically opposing Empires and the way they develop?

So why Islam specifically? Why not list Roman, Greek, Persian, Austro-Hungarian, Russian, British....

If I do though I'll be sure to tell them you said their religion was forced on them through violence and no-one ever chose to adopt it.

In a way though, this is very transparent. No atheist actually **CAN** believe anything other than religion is forced on someone because to believe it is a choice, or to believe (and this is what really freaks their pants) that there could be an actual thing called a *religious experience* is something they cannot comprehend. 

And as they are also convinced - like any good fundie - that they alone are right and have 'The Truth', what other option is there? It's the only thing they *can possibly* believe.

But as to it being rational, analysed, thought-out.... alas, no.

<TEXT> No, I don't think Shah really 'did' academia lol. Though he was a graduate of Oxford. 

I did Islamic Studies to postgrad and had access to a lot of source material. I would say that the Sufi stories (as opposed to his talks and lectures say) are exactly the same and original. 

Some academics claim he just stole them but he didn't claim to write them - he just translated them. So if they criticise Shah's output in that regard they are criticising Sufi tradition in a way.

Books like "The Sufis" they don't like because it makes claims they think can't be proved - Witches and Sufism, Zen and Sufism, Freemasonry etc. 

But I would just read them (the stories) they've been passed down for 1000s of years and, in a way, Shah's status is irrelevant if you accept the Sufis had wisdom. 

As the Sufis say: The canal brings water but does not itself drink. </TEXT>

I've chatted to some - they seem to mention this thing called 'Genocide' - I don't recall any of them being enthusiastic Christians though. Which is good because the reason for my chats was about their own religion which they still seemed to practice.

I'd probably pretend, yes. And more then likely future generations would do more then pretend.

Holy mother of fuck. Maybe you should get some principles? You know, like the Christians getting slaughtered right now... don't see them pretending. 

You have less reason to than them in your own view - you think you have 'The Truth' and they don't. What happened to preserving **THAT**? 

Who the fuck said that? Please don't put words in my mouth,.

Not putting anything in your mouth. If I did there's a prefix **"IF"** so it would be a quite safe practice.

I know for you there is no "IF" but it revolves just the same. 

Peace treaties with tributes and taxes forced upon penalty of death.

So to paraphrase: your explanation of why there are still Christians and Jews when you claim they all converted and should be none is taxes. 

Who is levying the taxes now? 

Right. Atheist logic lol.

**Everyone was forced to convert to Islam**

*Err, I can see large groups of Jews, Christians and others who've survived for 1000s of years*

**They had to pay taxes and made peace treaties**

*Err.... so they WEREN'T forced to convert then?*

Also btw, the Qur'an and specifically Muhammad's Medina Charter (first ever written Constitution btw) forbid forced conversion - so there's that.

If someone came up to you with a sword and told you to convert you'd do it?

Do we have to worry about you in case ISIS make it this far? You're going to convert when they tell you?

And THEN you're going to join all the others who do the same and jet off converting others?

Yikes... not sure what's more scary, this fact (if it is one) about how people are or the ideas you have about history (if it's false).

**Bonus question:** how do you explain the existence of the other religions in Islamic cultures if 'the sword' was used to convert them all?

I am referring to the Christians throughout the Middle East even today (you might remember ISIS has started killing them so that kind of proves they exist), Jews in Iran etc.

Neither... thought the title was pretty clear no? What does it say? I'll repost it:

**Reductionist Literalism and not Religion or Atheism is the Problem.**

You get it?

Plenty of atheists are perfectly capable of understanding nuance and are willing to accept that Islam, like other religions, has some good ideas.

Yep, met one or two in this thread. I really appreciate them. amazing guys and hope to talk more. I don't decry them though when we look at what percentage they constitute.... is less than 1 isn't it? 

Why is that?

You could say that in Islam it's less than 1. You may be right even. But in the main most don't value that 1% of Muslims. I REALLY value the 1% of atheists that are rational and cool guys.

You'll find us less willing to have that conversation if you insist there are no bad ideas in Islam though, since there obviously are.

Wouldn't know about that as I didn't - and wouldn't - say any such thing. I guess you're confusing me with someone else so can't really comment on that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I just lost my faith too. 

After all the debates, all the arguments, all the philosophising - thousands of years of trying to work it all out and all the rationalist humanist tradition... all the claims to great thought and logic which you so obscenely lay claim to, all the rational analysis - all that did it in the end was the penetrating pinnacle of human intellectual achievement:

*I have lost my atheism! Allahu Ackbar! PBUH! PBUHHHHH!!!*

My only regret is that Socrates, Nietzsche, Voltaire and Descartes weren't here to witness your triumph and pay you homage. 

You truly are a collossus among men - there won't be a Muslim, Christian and Jew left believing by the time this hits the internets.

You won. You did it. For us all. If I wasn't a newly minted atheist I'd go as far as to say you're our very own personal Saviour Jesus.

<TEXT> I can't really explain to you the academic arguments if you're not interested enough to keep up with ongoing debates in a field you claim to be interested in.

It would be a waste of my time. But look on the bright-side - you get to be insulting and claim there *ARE* no such debates between atheist academics and Religious Studies departments in this very area.

I guess my mistake was in assuming that atheists would - by default - know of the latest research and discussions.

I think I was disabused of that notion by around Reply #5. 

But as I say, just claim there is not such thing happening - "stop lying" usually works - and we're all good.

Then along come atheists who not only *ALSO* believe that WE believe it (hilarious!) but they claim to be rational while doing it (hysterical!) and then don't listen when you logically point out their error! Then they keep repeating it!

We're laughing all right! At **YOU**!

<TEXT> I don't believe in magic yet here you are saying you do. People clearly believe in irrational things

The only difference between me and you is that you feel entitled to feel superior and downgrade what I believe while I accept your belief is valid for you. Works better for me.. but it is significant nonetheless. 

So why is it hard to fathom that suicide bombers that blow up with smiles on their faces are doing so out of their belief?

Did not say it was hard to fathom. I just don't believe it is the case. 

Would you say that Western troops - say - on a mission from which they will not return are doing so out of belief? I'd think you'd be wrong. I'd think there would be something you are blind to. I'd think you don't understand the power of a cause or what one feels, rightly or wrongly, is a 'just war'.

Even kamikazes would die for their nation because they believed it was for a good cause.

Exactly. I think you just kamikazied your own foot. 

EDIT: Actually maybe it is because you believe in magic you struggle to see how irrational beliefs can hurt people. 

Or maybe it is because you are blind to the magical elements of life you despise those that are not so vehemently and why you fight so strongly to assert you 'rightness'. Perhaps you are like the guy who never really went on the Gold Rush but is so eaten with the possibility that they might be made to look a fool by someone striking it rich that all they can ever think of or do is to 'prove' no gold exists to all the others who were too lazy, scared or 'rational' to set out on such quest to risk it all..... endless talking with all the other life-deniers, **TO** all the other life-deniers, vainly bolstering each other and giving each other succour before the grim hand of death blows the whistle on what you - and only you and your kind -are so convinced is all you have..... all you will ever have. 

I certainly hope you never promised someone you'd help them or cure them by waving a "magic" wand.

Lol.... careful, I might despatch something far more entertaining than a magic wand (come in Dr Freud) your way if I feel impish enough, ;)

<TEXT> Now sadly this effects society as a whole. Which is why I don't encourage it. But people will put their beliefs in front of reality which is why we have sick things like suicide bombing.

Do you think it's that simplistic though? I know there's a trope about 72 virgins (not true btw) but no Muslim I ever met thinks that is what awaits us... and I have had thousands of discussions just on that topic alone.

When a kid believes in Santa Claus is 'proof' part of the equation? I think not. Perhaps you could argue 'trust' (in the parents) is and clearly for some a religious leader might be an analogue. But I think people mostly believe something because they *want* it to be true. That's just how they want to live. 

You might call it 'magical thinking'. But maybe that's just me... I could be an exception as I really do believe in magic although I no longer really practice it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So the natural state of things is not believing until one has proof. 

This is getting kind of fruitless. I accept this is natural FOR YOU. You seem unable to accept that I don't work like that. I don't need proof to believe. It never crosses my mind. If it wasn't for debates with atheists I would never even consider anything remotely like it. 

As if I claim there is an invisible ghost goat stalking you all the time you will not say well I have no proof but until I can prove it wrong I'll believe it. 

I would say no such thing. For one thing, I am open to the possibility that ghosts (or other beings - not necessarily spirits of the dead) follow people round. If you told me this was so in my case I would not in the least ask for proof. I would assess you personally as to whether you were the sort of person who would be able to discern such a thing. 

Of course if it was **You** as you are now (ie an atheist) I would know you could not discern it so I would not believe. But there are people who I would believe it from and again, proof would not enter into the equation. 

Yet here you are with nothing but a claim, no proof believing there is a God. So why do you make an exception with in the case of a God believe?

Let's try this: do you accept that there are people who are so stupid (in your view) or so irrational (ditto) that their beliefs are not arrived at by logic? 

If you can grant that then perhaps - if it helps - you might envisage these people just 'feeling' something from some sort of emotional stance, trauma or just peer-pressure or whatever. 

If you can grant **THAT** then just assume I am one of them. 

Sorted! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm not sure what you are trying to say by "don't care" and "believing for themselves".

I believe it is possible for you to be right that there is no God and me to be right that there is a God.

Does that clear it up?

Edit: re 'proof' - I don't feel any need to prove this nor do I have (necessarily) anybody having 'proved' it to me and caused that belief. It's not derived (again necessarily) from Qur'an as such but, obviously, I see no contradiction or I could not hold contradictory beliefs.

<TEXT> No no, youre totally right. ISIS members arent true Muslims. You are though. Definitely.

Or maybe they are. Let's assume they are. You like to ask statements to be backed up by proof so show me how to do it.

ISIS are Wahabi which - you obviously know this, knowing all about Islam - arose as a sect in the 18th century.

The first question I suppose is - if they are the real Muslims as you claim - how does this work?

1200 years after Muhammad we get the true Muslims?

All the Muslims before that were following false Islam (including Muhammad) ok, but how does it work? How did they follow this false Islam till the truth of Wahabism turned up 1200 years later?

What's your take? Muhammad, Qur'an and all the previous teachings were false until 1800? Proof? Evidence?

Also what about now? There's 1.7 Billion Muslims. Probably less than a million are Wahabi. How does that work? 

Will the true Wahabi Islam eradicate the false 1.7 Billion? That's what ISIS believe and clearly you do too but they have no evidence at all... do you?

<TEXT> For epistemology, making a claim doesn't mean literally saying it out to others. It means having a proposition about the world you hold true. If they believe it is true, they are making a claim as to the state and nature of reality.

Why? I'm not. I've always seen things as a progression of positions I hold... I was brought up Christian - believed it. Then that evolved into a Nietzschean world-view for a while and on to Islam. 

May well be there's another stage down the line. None of them are a rejection of the previous one. Most people I know are the same.

In addition, saying 'you don't care' if others believe doesn't matter and generally isn't true.

It's not true for people who've over-invested in their chosen ideology but it's true for a lot of people. More than you think.

You have beliefs related to or conditional on your religious beliefs, which means that if you espouse and advocate those, people have good reason to question your core tenets. 

well, they feel like questioning them. It's all cool, they can... why not? Happens all the time. I don't mind. It just does not impact me or my belief at all. No connection. 

Claiming that you don't care what people believe and your religious belief doesn't impact your claims doesn't really fly given your arguments in a debate religion forum.

You don't know what my reasons are. In fact I only have one and if it gets fulfilled I'll be gone. 

I like talking philosophy but I limit myself here to redressing disinfo and misinfo re Islam and atheist misconceptions of religion generally.

My position is not to defend religion but to say rather: you are not attacking what religionists believe. You are attacking what you THINK they believe.

Once you start attacking what we actually believe and it's all rational and reasoned then I'll not be here. I have other things to do.

<TEXT> What do you believe your religion teaches about the nature of reality and what evidence is available to confirm it?

Big question. 

I suppose it depends what you mean by Reality - Islam teaches about this in two specific regards:

1) The Natural world - ie observable phenomena... basically Science

2) The Spiritual world - ie Man's 'Inner Life' as a form of proto-psychology writ large as a system of ethics and primarily an answer to the question 'how should I live'? Basically Islamic philosophy.

We can summarise both briefly and pick up on any points arising:

1) I don't personally believe there is anything in Islam which conflicts with science of any time or place. The evidence I have for this is the long list of Scientific advances by individual muslims. 

As Muslims invented The Scientific Method (al-Haytham was the first to use experiment and observation as the basis of science - 10th century CE - also founded experimental psychology, and phenomenology) and employed it across the board then this should be the answer to this question of #1.

2) Is more tricky. I would make a distinction between 'what does the Qur'an teach' and 'what do Muslims believe'. In another sense, many 'Islamic traditions' come from elsewhere and can be proved to do so.

Veiling for example is an adoption from Christian nuns in the Middle East region. Stoning as a punishment is mentioned nowhere in Qur'an etc. 

Much of what passes for Islam today in the mind of the average Westerner is essentially Wahabism. Which is, more or less, the expression of a Saudi sect which is less than 1% of belief and which emerged around 200 years ago. It would have remained a small cult were it not for the discovery of oil on the region they occupied. Before that they were virtually unknown and very small tribal schismatic group. 

All verifiable. So we need to differentiate between that (ie the belief of the Sauds, Taleban, Daesh etc) and what is more normative mainstream belief. 

Of course it boils down to this: God is unknowable. In fact He is the only thing that really exists. Everything else will pass away - He will not. The thing that will not pass away when all else has we call 'God'.

This 'God' sends Revelations to various people at various times. They are meant to be understood sometimes literally and sometimes metaphorically. 

This God and this way of living do not require anything to be proved to anyone. If you choose to disbelieve it on any grounds - whether because of lack of 'proof' or any other reason - you are free to do so and it's all cool.

<TEXT> Thanks man, I appreciate the support. The most annoying thing about this issue is that it kind of forces you to be the person you don't want to be: a prostletyser for a religion.

That's the last thing I am or want to be in any sense - to me, I believe we all have our own Truth for ourselves and our only duty is to find it, could be atheism for one guy, Buddhism for another - but when something is not factually correct you need to point it out. That's the point at which you run into the issue... you get forced into a box you're not in.

It seems that many people can't extend things that they agree do and should apply to their group (context, wide range of opinions, non-generalisations etc) to their nominal opponents. 

If you're not on one side or the other you get stuck in the middle being shot at by both sides. I've had exactly the same criticisms - exactly the same minus the atheist context - shot at me by hardcore conservative Muslims. 

Still... there's always hope right? 

As an aside: I think the internet has a lot to do with this trend... it's kind of empowered laziness of thought.

<TEXT>  What I'm saying is that whether or not their behaviour is unislamic in your opinion doesn't mean that it actually is.

No, and likewise whether or not their behaviour is Islamic in your opinion doesn't mean that it actually isn't.

But surely a Muslim who has studied Islam in depth for decades is more likely to be correct in this context than an atheist who hasn't studied it at all. Don't you think? Wait... no, don't answer that, we'll call it rhetorical. 

No, because atheism holds no tenets on which you can base that plan. Unlike Islam.

This is what I'm talking about. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. You're very, very wrong. 

Q: What makes someone a Muslim?

A: Subscribing to the *Shahada* - that's it. Nothing else. Believe that and you're a Muslim period. Regardless of whatever else you may or may not believe. 

Q: what is *Shahada*?

A: "There is no God........... except God. And Muhammad is a Prophet of God"

Here btw, God can also mean 'Reality' or even 'Truth'.

So... no tenets. 

Just as your atheist comparison, this one doesn't hold up. Vegetarianism is a single stance on a single issue. It's not open to interpretation. Unlike Islam. One can find justification for pretty much anything in the Qu'ran.

Well we just knocked down your above fallacy so this kind of falls on its own. Actually this is really a bit embarrassing... 

*It's not open to interpretation.*

It's **TOTALLY** open to interpretation!!!!!! That's why you can have ISIS in one corner and RUMI on the other both reading *the exact same thing*!!!

And worse (for you) Qur'an ITSELF States it is a matter of interpretation and has many levels of meaning! It states it is metaphor in many places which you have to INTERPET!!

Your opinion on what is and isn't Islamic is of equal value to the opinion of someone who disagrees with you.

No, it is of no value to you but you are - no disrespect - not significant in as much as you have no real interest in the issue... it is just a by-product of your agenda which your agenda dictates you address. 

I am an academic in this field and debate with people who disagree on all these matters continually. Sometimes they are even right and I concede the points and learn something. The difference between you and them though is that they know the subject inside out and don't make silly rookie mistakes. 

I know nothing of evolutionary biology but the same thing would happen to me if I tried to take on Dawkins in that area just because I want to oppose atheism. 

It also doesn't help that those you disagree with can often explain their ideas and actions by pointing at verses in the Qu'ran.

Well again, a bit silly. If I was to show now the famous Sam Harris texts about torture and the right to kill you would no doubt cite 'context'. Let me know if you wouldn't because I'd love that. 

If I asked you why the British are commanded to fight Germans on beaches and showed you Churchill quotes to prove it then you would not concede the point. The question is more properly "What mechanism allows you to claim context in every situation, even modern ones, but not in historical documents over 1000 years old?"

What Islam is is what it's adherents make of it.

Wait... so it IS subject to interpretation now??? Earlier you said this:

*It's not open to interpretation.*

????

Yeah, let's grab the facts, let's see how the numbers actually stack up.

1.6 Billion Muslims

Number of extremist Islamist groups in Iraq/Syria: around 100

Number of confirmed Muslims *from Europe* who have gone to fight with one of these 100 factions in last 15 years: 5000

Number of confirmed Muslims *from US* who have gone to fight with one of these 100 factions in last 15 years: 12 (FBI) 

There have been around 140,000 terror attacks committed worldwide since 1970. Assuming - for argument's sake - 100% of these attacks were by Muslims. That works out at  0.00009% of Muslim population. 

No. There's no such thing as 'true Islam', it's all opinions.

So you've shifted your argument from "Islam is ISIS" to "Islam is nothing.. just many opinions". But none of them are valid. Ok... got that. It's the old "I don't know what it is but I don't need to because it's crap" line. Ok. 

But just as you're probably not interested in hearing why Islam is bullshit, I really don't care about the opinions of Muslims on what is and isn't Islamic. 

Lol, I really honestly wrote my last comment to your quote **BEFORE** I read this!!!! I am just too good sometimes. Or you're too predictable... I think that's more likely. Lol.

Would love to hear your response if I said "Atheism is what I say it is... I am not interested in what an atheist says it is!". 

Thanks for the laugh at the end... it was all getting a bit philosophical I agree!

Do you mind if I steal this and paraphrase it a bit for the next time an atheist asks me to 'prove God exists'?

Oh and I know you're busy but when you get a min can you also tell me the approved answer that atheists give when someone says you have to find God for yourself and they can't prove it? I have a feeling I might need to study it.  </TEXT>

I have no shortage of articles to read about Islam from all other angles - I'm an academic in a related field so that's not the issue. Just wondered if you knew of any atheist-specific ones as I don't.

So we seem to be at the point where there are no articles of that nature by atheists - or at least I don't know any and you can't point me to any - but I'm not allowed to say so as it would be generalising.

Is that a fair summation? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The point of bringing that up is to show you maybe you can change your thinking on the question. I look at the existence of god the same way I look at the existence of dragons. Seems like I'm being consistent.

Actually seems like you're being irrational. A dragon - if it were to exist - would be of the order of 'existent things' and therefore, were GOD to exist alongside the dragon, in your argument God would be a 'created thing'. 

Which is nothing to do with anything as no religion ever believed God is a 'created thing' - He would be the creator of the dragons and therefore or a different order of things. 

What you are saying is that both dragons and God are of the same order of things - which to you they are, ie you think they are both 'made up', that's why you compare them... so this is circular reasoning. 

So, null points. </TEXT>

Yes, that was my point, just as there is a 'New Atheism' there are equivalent 'New Islamisms' and Christianity. And then there's the Alt-Right. 

yet people that subscribe to the more hardline anti-theistic/anti-religious 'New Atheism' (another horrible term) is not really that big.

Yes, I agree. We have the same problem if you set aside the religious context: the most rabid and vocal element will, if they claim to be the 'true voice', be assumed to be so by those not involved in the wider group or knowledgeable about it.

<TEXT> Reductionist, reductionist, reductionist...

Question for you. Do you think things exist in the abstract? I mean is there such a thing as a 'dog'? Or would someone be reductionist in identifying a being and applying that label?

How about with ideological positions? Is there such a thing as a 'Muslim'? A 'racist'? A 'Republican'?

If someone says - for example - 'I believe in God' can we then call them a believer? Or do we have to not say that as it's reductionist and say instead "Mr X claims to believe in God"?

Because that could get kind of tedious. This is probably the only time in my life I've actually **HOPED** someone's just trying to win a cheap point.

I'd say that evidence of this is lacking. 

Yes, in your terms definitely. Non-existent even. It must be so. 

Thus far, I don't think that you've really given an analysis of anything, you've just presented a bunch of your reductionist views as if they were facts.

Is there a playbook for this or is it just coincidence that every time someone posts (say) on 'Subject X' then the more militant opposers accuse that person of suffering from 'Subject X'.

When they post on 'Subject Y' - even tangentially - then the counter is 'typical response of Y'. 

I find that odd. And also highly suggestive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But seriously, you saying ISIS and Wahabism being 'unislamic' has the same worth of them calling you 'unislamic'. Essentially nothing.

If I wanted to stop any reasonable debate I could just play that card too re your reply and move on. Luckily for you (or maybe not) I don't think your post is 'essentially nothing'. Not that this will change anything but I continue...

It's all about what they claim to support. If they claim Islam, and do horrible things in the name of Islam (which is in fact supported by the Qu'ran. And before you ask, yes, I have read it, and yes, it was in Arabic.) then it is meaningless to say what they do is 'unislamic'.

So if I start an 'atheist militia' and start chopping people's heads off for being religious it's going to mean you need to start answering some tough questions right? 

I don't think so - very surprised you would. In my view it would have *nothing to do with you* because, as they say, "that's not how it works". I can call myself a vegetarian and stuff BigMacs 24/7. It matters not. Labels still mean *SOMETHING*

But thanks for bringing this up - I mean that - as I was going to touch on this in my OP but thought I'd waffled enough.... the related concept of "REBRANDING* things - not only to be their opposite (always a good one) but also to instil the view that the label is the definition and not the actuality. It used to be that the 'thing itself' was the benchmark of what it is... now that doesn't matter at all... it's just the concensus of *what it is needed to be seen as* by whoever's agenda is in play.

If it looks like a duck, feels like a duck and also claims to be a duck, I'm going to accept it's a duck. Even if a lot of other birds are telling me it's quacking is 'unducklike'.

That's my point. You're not. Not remotely. With a duck you know what a duck is. With Islam you know what the consensus in your peer-group SAY Islam is. 

So:

*If it looks like what my position needs Islam to be, feels like what my position needs Islam to be, I'm going to it's Islam. Even if every Muslim on earth tells me its total negation of everything they ever believed or taught is 'unIslamic'.*

In short: there are probably less than 0.0001% of Muslims who hold Islamist or extremist views and a vast majority of the remainder who oppose them. 

Whenever you encounter one of these vast majority - and we can actually break this down with figures if you want - you insist, without knowing what the majority think re Islamism/Extremism, that this 0.0001% is in fact the 'correct version' and the millions and millions of Muslims who oppose them are wrong.

How they *could* be wrong - and wrong for 1400 years till Daesh turned up with the TRUE ISLAM - does not interest you in the least apparently.

Thanks for this very helpful. I figured it out!

It's maybe the fact he is a rabid right-wing Islamophobe? The fact he is a prime example of someone who refuses to engage with the actual facts if presented with them? The fact he supports the Neocon wars? The fact he supports torture and in some cases extra-judicial murder?

So know I know why people do it to me.... it's because I **DON'T** support war, torture and murder and I **DO** evaluate the facts as they stand isn't it?

<TEXT> My view is that at the end of the day we are all humans and we must strive to become better humans. Let`s take time out from debating each other to unite under the banner of humanity which I believe is crucial for healthy coexistence.

My take exactly. Unfortunately we have a lot of work to do to find the method of doing that while allowing people to hold opposing beliefs. 

I tend to suspect the problem is not in the beliefs (or non-beliefs or lack of beliefs I need to also add here for our atheists friends) but the degree to which the individual is *identified* with the belief (or lack of) in terms of their own self-ideation. The more identification and the less detachment the more likely they are to be hyper-sensitive regarding their position and be pre-disposed to see any debate as a personal attack. 

Stage 1 is to get to the point where we can all be in the same room together. We're decades off that at the very least. </TEXT>

In theory but my point is they don't ever consider options which are out of current knowledge do they?

<TEXT> While I respect your post and appreciate the time you've taken to answer sincerely I think there's a slight problem in the use of the term 'delusions' here. 

It's ok to think that someone is deluded - I think it about atheists a lot lol - but if debate is the goal then it kind of gets things off on the wrong foot. Not for me, I don't personally care or get offended by it, I'm just saying. Religionists do it too all the time.

But to your main point as that's just in passing: I think the thing about 'the Book' being the 'bad' thing in the mix is the exact opposite for me. Cat Stevens was in hospital after a crash and it so happened all he had to read was the Qur'an. So he read it and that's why he converted. He later said that he had never met a Muslim at that point and if he had known the ones he later met before reading Qur'an he never would have converted. That's exactly how I feel. It seems the opposite of your position in a way.

I think this is also a lot of the problem - people judge Qur'an almost exclusively from a highly conditioned context (currently that would be Islamophobic, Right-wing and Fundie Christian propaganda) and not from what it actually is. And they don't even see their conditioned bias.

I grew up in a Fundie Xian environment and know very many of the 'movers and shakers' even now. You'd better believe they are political and have propaganda outlets you probably aren't remotely aware of. 

My point in saying that is, because of this, I am able to trace a lot of the memes against Islam - which range from falsities to misunderstandings to outright lies - to this source. It seems odd to see atheists (not you) employing them as ammo sometimes because:

a) they are Christian propaganda and

b) they are so transparently erroneous in many cases that it is embarrassing. 

One of the great things atheist and humanist thought (and there are many great things) has at its core which I wish religion would also adopt more, is the commitment to rigorous analysis and a search for truth and facts Unfortunately (and this was the theme of my OP) it seems often to be mere lip-service these days. Where IS the rigorous dissection?

Many humanists often say they agree with the ideal "I disagree with you but will defend your right to say it" but I think allegiance to *facts* is far more important.

I would love to see atheist articles taking down lies and disinfo about Islam - not because they want to support Islam but because they are wedded to Truth and the principles of Research.

All too often though it's more a case of: 'this is good ammo - that will make a big bang!' regardless of facts.

<TEXT>  I have never seen a miracle, I HAVE seen people witness something they don't understand and call it a miracle.

Exactly my position. 

Of course my categories would be broader than yours I expect: I would say this to someone who had seen a ghost for example. I would expect you would just say 'ghosts don't exist'. 

The difference appears to be that when religionists see 'something they don't understand' which probably utilises as yet undiscovered laws, they shout **"it's a miracle!"** because they can't say *"well we don't know what this is yet but there it is"*.

When atheists see 'something they don't understand' which probably utilises as yet undiscovered laws, they shout **"show me the evidence or it didn't happen!"** because they can't say *"well we don't know what this is yet but there it is"*.

I guess neither side are comfortable not knowing. Even just for now.

<TITLE> Reductionist Literalism and not Religion or Atheism is the Problem. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-12 11:50:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here's my theory: Over the course of this century and in the run up to the Millennium, we have entered a cyclic period where everything is reduced to a paradigm of either/or and black/white reductionist 'thought'. Literalism is a side effect of this and it is a cancer that has infected Humanist thought and religious thought equally. 

I would cite the rise of Islamic 'fundamentalism' (the wrong word because a true fundamentalist would be a very different beast but more of that later) as a *by-product* of this (ie not a cause) just as much as I would US Exceptionalist policies as a similar by-product. 

Perhaps Bush's "You're with us or against us" meme is the key leitmotif here. 

Here's some pertinent examples: I argue myself often against irrationality and I target my own chosen belief-system more than anything else both here and elsewhere. I can point out the errors of Daesh and Wahabism till the cows come home. Nothing gives me greater pleasure (almost lol) than to stick it to these idiots.

But, here's the kicker: when I do that with an atheist they are generally so wedded to the idea of "Islam bad" (substitute 'religion' or 'Abrahamic' here if you need to) that they seem to interpret my defence of Islam in showing that (say) Daesh are unIslamic as an attack on their own position. 

In other words they cannot join with me in attacking certain Islamic views because in doing so I am necessarily showing they are NOT really Islamic views. I am not attacking Islam to refute Islam but attacking Daesh for not upholding Islam. So in a way to agree with me (to them) means supporting a religious view.

This is reductionist thought.

But there's more. An unavoidable concomitant of this 'thought' process is to fail to discern what Islam (or religion in the abstract) really is. It's 'bad' so it can all go in the 'Bad Corner' - we don't need to know in what ways the 'badness' manifests. We would only need to do that if we were open to there not being 'bad' involved or we were looking for something 'good'. Which of course we're not. 

I can virtually guarantee that this post will be treated in the same way. 

It's no coincidence that the 'New Atheism' is nothing like the Old School and contains bigots like Sam Harris who, were they to arise in any other context, would be classed as a fundie nutter. It's reactionary and has nothing to do with a search for truth. If it did I might be tempted to even hitch a ride as a fellow traveller but alas, 'tis impossible. 

Tl;dr atheists have in theory common cause with many progressive believers and those believers are disposed to work with atheists on many issues but it's not happening and I think we know why. Because atheists have more in common as a demographic with the conservative religionists the progressive believers are fighting.

Exactly. Every monotheistic tradition has its own inner mystical core which simultaneously IS the religion.

Christianity certainly does and Islam has Sufism (which is believed to have heavily influenced the development of Zen btw) which is very similar in many respects.

<TEXT> Yes, it is a shame. There is much in Islam that I think atheists could connect with. You don't have to worry about Original Sin, lots of Scientific enquiry - Muslims invented the Scientific Method ffs - and there's not all the sexual control stuff going on. 

Of course there IS a deviated fundie Islam too, we know that. But you'd think that people could use logic and see past it. Seems not.

Atheism is really missing the boat as to what it could be on another note. It could really serve as an antidote to all sorts of BS in the world but it doesn't seem able to actually find the leaders who could do that. When you boil it down it's subject to exactly the same biases, prejudices and misogony as everything else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> because in the West we currently see them as the only ones being so radicalized.

We SEE that but it's not what's happening.

Islamic Extremism is (currently) feeding off US wars and foreign-policy giving rise to terrorist groupings - some of whom are funded by the West. And so the cycle goes.

As these groups commit more and more atrocities - and as the West creates the conditions for their growth more - then the boot will be on the other foot - ie just as the terror groups are a reaction in part against the West's actions so will there arise Western groups in response to Islamist actions.

We're seeing it already but they have not yet had their 9/11. When they do it will be full circle. 

Remember before 9/11 there was years of Islamist groups under the radar. I think we're maybe a year off some Western militia doing something somewhere. But they do not have any State funding as Daesh and Taleban have occasionally had from the West and Saudi. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure, many Muslims don't believe in evolution but there are many literalists out there. Qur'an kind of suggests it also imo.

Here's one Muslim thinker Al-Jahiz (781-869 CE) in 'The Book of Animals':

"Animals engage in a struggle for existence; for resources, to avoid being eaten and to breed. Environmental factors influence organisms to develop new characteristics to ensure survival, thus transforming into new species. Animals that survive to breed can pass on their successful characteristics to offspring."

Ibn Khaldun - 'The Muqadimmah' (1377 CE)

"One should then take a look at the world of creation. It started out from the minerals and progressed, in an ingenious, gradual manner, to plants and animals. The last stage of minerals is connected with the first stage of plants, such as herbs and seedless plants. The last stage of plants, such as palms and vines, is connected with the first stage of animals, such as snails and shellfish. The animal world then widens, its species become numerous, and, in a gradual process of creation, it finally leads to man, who is able to think and reflect. The higher stage of man is reached from the world of monkeys, in which both sagacity and perception are found..."

The poet Rumi also has a poem about it - along the same lines.

In some way it doesn't matter does it? I mean it's a moot point because if the archetype of the 'holy man' or Jesus-figure exists (and it does) then it doesn't matter WHO they project it on to does it?

If it wasn't Jesus it would be someone else. 

The concept is an archetype and is far older than Christianity. I'd see far more mileage in arguing that it was just morphed on to a historical figure... claiming he did not exist runs into far more problems. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This word, 'mystical,' is rather ill defined in this context so I cannot address it specifically, but in general, for how most use this word, I cannot agree.

I shall content myself with some quotes - I won't attribute them because that's more fun for me - and that is in short supply on this sub:

The finest emotion of which we are capable is the mystic emotion. Herein lies the germ of all art and all true science. Anyone to whom this feeling is alien, who is no longer capable of wonderment and lives in a state of fear is a dead man. To know that what is impenetrable for us really exists and manifests itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, whose gross forms alone are intelligible to our poor faculties  this knowledge, this feeling . . . that is the core of the true religious sentiment. In this sense, and in this sense alone, I rank myself among profoundly religious men.

Atheism is so senseless   odious to mankind that it never had many professors."

Nirvana is a state of pure blissful knowledge It has nothing to do with the individual. The ego or its separation is an illusion. Indeed in a certain sense two Is are identical namely when one disregards all special contents  their Karma. The goal of man is to preserve his Karma and to develop it further when man dies his Karma lives and creates for itself another carrier........ Although I think that life may be the result of an accident, I do not think that of consciousness. Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms.   </TEXT>

How do you know? You've just stated a belief (or a 'fact' if you prefer, as I suspect you will) - if belief conditions reality (as is MY belief) then this is what I would expect. You believe something you get it. 

I believe the opposite - I also get it.

<TEXT> Do you accept the good ones then?

In theory. Much atheist response seems polemical to me. Which is fine, nothing wrong with that but there's a hell of a lot of special-pleading to wade through and in general I don't often run into an atheist with the same detachment that I have re their world-view.

For example, I can think right now of about 3 pretty hard to counter arguments against Islam. I have never yet heard one of them advanced by an atheist. I think that's because they don't feel it necessary to go far enough into a study of Islam to know what they are, in part anyway.

So that's problem #1.

These issues ARE discussed by muslim thinkers and there's lots of debate and dissension - has been for centuries. I enjoy that. But we never really get that deep.... and then the arguments are that we don't have to! 

So that's problem #2. 

If an atheist - who would probably have to be an ex-muslim I guess (though often these guys are even more literalist and that's what they think Islam is and what they are rejecting) - were to start discussing them in an objective manner I'd be up for it. 

I don't see a similar open attitude in most atheists. That would be problem #3 and that's way enough.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think so. This is a common misconception that religious people have.

It's not one that I have. I'm not referring to leaders or religious thought. Just that someone you regard now as 'rational' - something which you also lay claim to - could suddenly start acting, based on the same history of reasoning, as 'irrational'.

If tomorrow, it came out that the Prophet was shown to have been insane, it would make some question whether the Quran was truly divinely inspired.

Would it? Long tradition of the mad having a direct link to God in Islam and also in Eastern Christianity. Rasputin and the 'Holy Fools' are examples of this. Diogenes was another one now I come to think of it.

But there is no 'authority' in atheism.

Funny, there is no 'authority' in Islam either. This bit: "There are prominent thinkers, but they are no more an authority than I am." could be a purely Islamic concept. Actually it is.

 It is a presentation of evidence, and that evidence would still exist even if Dawkins was shown to be insane. 

 It is a presentation of evidence, and that evidence would still exist even if Dawkins was shown to be insane. 

Strange, I have read his books and see no evidence presented. It's basically all polemic.

You could dispose of every religion ever conceived of and prove them all false and you still would not have made the slightest impact on the question of whether or not God exists. 

In fact, the constant Aunt-Sally attacks on religion can really (in this context) be only one of two things:

1) based on an assumption that to disprove a given religion is to disprove God (God I hope not... please don't let it be this)

2) a diversion from addressing the main issue of God and pretending that you've got somewhere by proving some moronic religionists wrong (I call this the "Real Madrid vs Under-10 Boy Scouts C team match-up" with the added shameful disgrace that not only do RM score 100 goals they claim that this proves they've won the Champions League)

<TEXT> Yes... true. But the issue is a twofold one. As I understand it atheists generally argue against two things in this context:

1) the divinity of Jesus

2) the possibility of miracles and supernatural happenings

It seems to me that the argument #2 is often used against #1 and in a more general sense.

In this case #2 is taken out of the equation - it would have to be admitted that miracles occur and that religion just misread the cause.

It more likely shows he's just human and not divine though. Especially if he is just an ordinary guy in one of them.

By the way, you're also conflating the belief in a religion with the truth of the religion itself.

No, I am only talking about belief as a consequence of experience. I don't think the MU would impact on the existence of God one way or another so is not about that.

It would not matter if Dawkins was a televangelist (which hardly a good example of a believer anyway) that still does not make religion any more or less plausible.

True, agree there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The idea of multiple universes is often cited as being - if proved - a massive problem for religion, but might it not be the opposite case? Ie an argument in favour of religion and a problem for atheists?

For an example: Jesus's miracles could just be one example of something that happens in one in a million universes. It just happens to be ours.

Also if we are products of our beliefs and experiences then maybe one person's atheism (or faith) would not be present in other universes. Maybe somewhere Dawkins is a televangelist? Or the Pope is instead an evolutionary biologist?

Surely acceptance of the MU model raises more tricky theological and philosophical issues than it resolves?

<TEXT> There's a pretty in-depth assessment at the link below.

It comes down to maths.

If you take the hadith and work out A'isha's age in relation to known facts then she could not have been 6. 

In short:

 Aishah (r.a.) was 67 when she passed away in 50 AH, seventeen at the time of the Hijrah, sixteen at the time of her betrothal to the Prophet (s.a.w.), and nineteen when she moved in with him.  This cannot be contested unless we bend the rules of arithmetic.

And further the ONLY hadith that argue for the 6/9 age (not all do by any means) *ALSO* mathematically prove the 16 age - they are therefore contradictory:

the only reports that Aishah (r.a.) was six, or nine, come from someone who also reports that she had to be sixteen when betrothed, and nineteen when she moved in with the Prophet (s.a.w.).

<TEXT> geneshackman - it's saying the latter. 'Allah' is the name of God in Islam not a specific name of an Islamic deity.. so the Jews and Christians cited there would say 'Allah' for their God too. Still do.

This translation I copied and pasted from is maybe a little archaic.. there are others that make the point better and it says it in other places in Qur'an too. 

Islam holds that these previous religions are also sent from God and that the Prophets of those religions were actually also sent from God: Jesus, Moses etc... so it follows that those following them (if the religion at that point was uncorrupted) would be following the same religion in a sense... or at least worshipping the same God.

Btw, this cuts the other way too: Islam also teaches that not all Muslims will go to heaven and in fact maybe very few will. It says specifically that in the end-times the Muslims there will be the furthest from Islam. 

The end-time prophecies are pretty much exactly what we are seeing now btw and even describe an ISIS-like group, the rise of building and riches in Saudi and certain forms of modern technology. 

I might start a thread on it but am a bit scared of the Karma-cost.

<TEXT> Hi, thanks for this... it seems like a good way to start off. Especially as we have no following as of now. The field for sure is one of quite wide interest with numerous communities - I don't think there'd be difficulty getting a following because there is a lot of 'blogable' issues around the product and it's a very active area in terms of research/discussion and even podcasts.

My main concern would be though that if we're all set up and running with a store then what would the KS be  framed for? We basically need some cash for running-costs, salaries, website and some demo product.

We have some cash to invest obviously but we were going to KS the site and use our investment for running costs. In this scenario we'd have to cover the website costs and the running costs for a year somehow so that negates the need for a KS right?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good question - Maybe I should have been clearer. I guess I am asking about the level of transparency required and whether the allocation of any donated funds is a factor in the success.

In the main we need funding for:

1) The website

2) some of the demo machines

3) costs of (say) 5 pop-up demos during the first year

4) one years' salary for one person - scaled back to as low as poss. We are a team of 3, the others will not take salary for the first year. 

I guess I'm asking that if we itemised all that would we be judged on the allocation of these funds or do people donate on the basis of whether they like the project regardless of that. 

Also, I suppose we're newbies and a bit skeptical that it could work because we don't have a pool of supporters in place. Not sure how to reach them or whether during the life of the campaign it would be possible to reach enough - so I'm asking that too. 

Also to what degree would it depend on the 'perks'? </TEXT>

<TITLE> New to Crowdfunding - questions re if my project is suitable </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-09 16:13:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am starting an online business and am considering making a Kickstarter for it but not sure if it is the right way to go. 

I can't say much about the business in detail but in brief it is an online store selling items related to Spiritual applications of technology. For example devices to induce meditative states or lucid dreams, personal float tanks, binaural beats and books, material related to these applications. 

The business will be online but we will promote it through occasional pop-up events and demos at appropriate venues and conferences. 

We don't envisage carrying much stock - we're pretty much mainly looking at despatch on order from the manufacturers in some cases but we do need some demo machines and some part of the running costs. We've got about a third of the funding from our own pocket but probably would need about 50k more. 

My questions really are two:

1) Would this business and this amount be a good project to attempt to Crowdfund? Any resources anyone can point to for us to gen up on this?

2) I've heard that it all depends on your Social Media reach to a large extent. Is this true? If so then there might be a problem because we don't have one or any pool of likely donators. 

Any recs, tips or help gratefully received! </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I was one of the people who witnessed one of the supposedly supernatural miracles of Jesus, what would probably happen is the following:

With the greatest respect I don't believe that and in fact it's impossible that you could have reacted that way. Here's why:

Me: But that's impossible, how did you do that?
Jesus: I'm the son of God, and you can join my father's kingdom in heaven by accepting me

Jesus never claimed to be the Son of God. *Modern Christians* claim he did but no responsible academic authority (who is objective and not Christian) accords with this view. Many Christian academics are honest enough to admit it to. 

So this is #1. Jesus would not have said this. He **might** have said that you could do the miracles too - that was his teaching. For example when he walsk on the water he also tells Peter he can do the same if he has faith. And he does. Sort of. 

Me: Sounds good. From now on, I am a Christian. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm just gonna go back to fishing day and night and being heavily taxed and abused by the Romans for the next decade or so

This would not have happened either. At this point there was no such thing as 'Christianity' but Jesus had 12 disciples who he was teaching individually. It is by no means a given that you or anyone else would be permitted to join this group and there is no record of Jesus seeking to add to it anywhere in the Gospels. He preached to many people a certain message but he did not recruit. 

Also there is a large amount of evidence that Jesus was in fact leading some sort of armed insurrection against the Romans (he positioned himself as the Messiah who had exactly this warrior-role, he told his disciples to arm, his punishment was by the Romans not the Jews as it would be for blasphemy, the punishment is for crimes against the state etc) so it seems from your comment re this that you MIGHT be interested in joining such a militia if possible. 

Jesus: Good, good, that's the spirit, my faithful adherent! Now, I must go, there are more people to convert

See above - Jesus at no point tried to convert anyone to a faith. Possibly this developed after this death with the actions of the apostles. 

Me: holds up finger. Wait a minute. On second thought, your dad's crib sounds pretty sweet, much better than what I have right now. Why don't I just... takes rope, kicks chair

Not sure about this as it doesn't make sense. We can pass on it I think. 

Surprised none of the witnesses did.

I have the answers why they didn't above. No need to thank me.

<TEXT> But, I think that the differences are more important in order to understand the religions.

Sure... but that is not the point of the translation is it? It's addressing different concerns and countering the more divisive views.

Btw - regarding your point there is no key point in Islam that was not believed by one or another early Christian grouping.. some of them quite major groups.

It has long been an argument in academia that Islam could be viewed as a Christian sect and  - while I don't agree on theological grounds - it is impossible to argue against academically.

1) Jesus did not die on cross... Gnostic belief

2) Jesus was not divine - early Christian belief of some groups. See Aryans and Nestorians

3) No resurrection - concomittant of #1

4) Virgin birth - both accept

5) Second coming - both accept

6) No Trinity - many early Christian groups did accept.

<TEXT> In short: keep the rational criticism of Islam coming. It's interesting and there isn't enough of it.

Absolutely agree. 

The problem though is a little worse than you state it. What we need in the West is a coherent overview of what Islam is and what Muslims believe. We don't have that. 

Because we don't have that we are in the position of a) people arguing against some aspect which does not exist or is wrongly interpreted and b) muslims having to explain what the religion actually is and then getting bogged down in arguments about why they are wrong. 

It is quite legitimate to criticise Islam but the debate should be surrounding established actualities. Right now it isn't - we need to get more understanding of what Islam actually teaches and what it doesn't.

After that people can have at it but right now we're not working from the same playbook.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In terms of literature, the Quran be no where near the top of literary masterpieces, 

How is your academic grasp of world literature? What was your Phd in again?

unless you ask of course, a muslim.

So very wrong. Most would be pretty averse to my claims. Only an academic in the field and/or academic who happens to be muslim would hold this view. 

If you constrain the criteria to "Arabic poetic forms", than perhaps your argument carries some weight...

Not really. You clearly know nothing of the Middle Eastern masterpieces which actually DO exist. Probably you think there are none, that would not surprise me, but there is quite a list. And the Qur'an is on it.

We are all subject to bias, but I am not so biased as to not recognize a great piece of literature when I see it, 

And yet what are your criteria? Are you capable of separating content from style as an academic has to? I somehow think not. I happen to know several academics in the field who are atheists who do recognise the Qur'an as a literary masterpiece but then they do speak Arabic and they are capable of that detachment.

Neither are most western authors and academics.

Oh dear. In the field of Middle Eastern Literature - surely the only criteria that matters in terms of academia - you are almost 100% wrong. 

I don't speak arabic 

Oh

(Why was the beauty of God's eternal message confined to just one language?)

It wasn't and isn't. Islam teaches that Revelations are sent to different peoples at different times. 

"To every people was sent an apostle" and "We sent not an apostle except to teach in the language of his own people, in order to make things clear to them."

Please do not try to tell me I have to learn arabic to appreciate the Quran. In case you don't know, fine poetry and literature can be translated and still keep it's meaning/beauty.

Yes. By a poet. Do you know of a poetic translation?

What other languages do you speak? Choose one and we can discuss how Shakespeare renders in it. I'm guessing you might want to argue that Shakespeare is equally Shakespeare in - say - Farsi. I hope you do.... it will be fun. 

I would love to see some general consensus amongst (non-muslim) intellectuals/writers throughout history praising the Quran as a fine work of literature.

You won't find it throughout history for the same reason you won't find any Japanese, Korean, African, Persian, Malay or other non-Western works in the Canon. 

Now if you want to take the totality of non-Western countries, take all their literature - you can even leave out all religious texts if you like - and argue that there are NO masterpieces in that grouping which deserve to be lauded I would love to have that discussion. The fact is the Western tradition is focussed on.... well, the Western tradition. There are reasons for it. None of them good. 

In terms of academia the situation is different. Not hard to research. Choose any top University with relevant departments: Princeton, Oxford, Edinburgh and look at their curriculums and lecturers then research their publications. 

Than what purpose did telling me "many people said Muhammad was illiterate" serve. I don't give a fuck about anecdotes.

Yes. I got that. You're not really the most rigorous academic seeker of truth. I did catch that. 

Is that outside the realm of possibilities? The Quran was compiled after his death, is it impossible that these scribes may have wanted to embellish their holy prophet's message?

It's not impossible but hard to argue. 

What about the ones who had a firm religious belief that it should remain unaltered? Would they stand by and let it happen? Were the scribes all poets? Unlikely. 

The odd thing here is something I always find hilarious. I'll share it with you and why it is so amusing. Atheists are always trying to discredit Islam but they remind me of the 'Vulture Squadron' of Dick Dastardly and Muttley. They never quite 'Catch the Pigeon' despite all their crazy schemes.

The funny thing is that most muslims know many areas where the atheists could really score some points but -a nd this is the hilarious part - atheists hammer away at things that score them no points at all and - despite claiming to be rational and knowing far more, being serious researchers etc - *they never ever even realise these weak points exist*.

Even more hilarious - and this is what has happened in this discussion - you can almost spell it out for them and hint at if from all different angles but they'll still **never get it**. 

It's like a bad thriller where the murderer is playing with a blood-stained knife in front of the 'Top Detective' who is just constantly giving a speech saying "that's the problem with you killers - I can see you're guilty by the fact you're wearing a hat but you're too stupid... you should have taken it off!!!"

In this case, if you had really researched the academic area and knew about the debates around this issue you would know that many academics have faced this problem and argued that the poetic forms of the Qur'an stem from Aramaic Christian panegyric hymns. 

Of course I don't agree with them but you should really know the argument. It's one of the mainstays of academic alternatives which atheist academics in the field argue to counter the Revelation argument. They don't - as you do - resort to "Qur'an is boring and not poetry". 

If you're going to fight in this arena you should really do it properly and come fully armed. Or at least be a master of your weapon if it happens to be a small and inappropriate one.

<TEXT> I'm having trouble understanding your comment. Can you simplify it for me?

Sure. As we know the Qur'an does in fact exist there are 4 possibilities:

1) God revealed it

2) Muhammad wrote it himself

3) someone else wrote it

4) Muhammad 'channelled it' in some way

Muslims believe #1 (and #4 if you think he channelled it from God).

Atheists can't believe #1 or really #4 so they go for #2 but this is a problem if they don't also argue he was a great poet. For which there is no evidence and which they would be very loathe to do anyway because, you know, 'Islam sucks' lol

<TEXT> This is your (biased)opinion. 

No, it's the opinion of academics and experts in Arabic poetic forms. Is your opinion unbiased would you say?

I for one think it is incoherent, repetitive, boring, and unremarkable. 

How is your Arabic? It should really be more than remarkable itself for you to be an objective judge on that particular issue

This high literary esteem given to the Quran seems to stem almost exclusively from Muslims, coincidence?

Can't really be a coincidence because it's not actually the case. Can provide numerous academic references if required.

And this is some sort of proof that he was illiterate? 

Nope. It's you hung up on proof not me. As I always say, I don't give a fuck about proof. It's not like I'm an atheist. 

how are we to know that his scribes were not well versed in poetry?

I suppose such a view would entail a belief that a) Muhammad said one thing and b) the poetic scribes went to work on it altering it poetically and c) no-one noticed or mentioned it.

Stranger things have been believed I suppose. It's as rational as any other atheist take on the matter I guess.

<TEXT> Otherwise stated: your argument is a completely seperate one and doesn't handle this argument directly. It skirts the issue entirely by trying to change the focus of the argument.
The problem with this 'master poet' argument is that you cannot objectively prove to me that the Quran is beautiful poetry. I have no idea what that is even supposed to mean.
So, arguing he's either receiving a message from God or is a master poet is a false duality for me: we're ignoring the third option where he's a middling poet who elevated himself by falsing claiming to commune with a deity.
All you've done is attempt to spin the argument into something so subjective and relatively obscure so no one can make an argument against it. We weren't asking about beautiful poetry, we were asking why Muhammad tends to receive messages about dinner etiquette from God.

Ok. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But what you're trying to prove is that the Qur'an (which was spoken by Muhammad) is divine. That's what I'm disagreeing with.

Yeah I hear you. My point is that the poetry of the Qur'an is - in the East and not just among Muslims but among academics - of an extremely high standard. Which is taken by Muslims to be a proof of divine origin... especially as Muhammad was no poet and had a low opinion of them. 

Despite the lack of understanding on this issue elsewhere on this thread I'd argue it's directly relevant and of interest to both atheists and the discussion in general. 

Far from me wanting to 'prove' the divinity of the Qur'an (I am attempting no such thing) I am merely framing the debate. It would be a far more fruitful approach to argue someone other than Muhammad wrote the Qur'an if you want to go that route. That's the line I would take if I was an atheist.

You could build a nice case - but I won't do your work for you! Look into it. It's far more likely than that he wrote it. If one is to stick with the 'he wrote it' angle then it's going to go into 'channelled works' (of which there are many in history and maybe it is even one.. who knows?) but the options are few:

1) God revealed it

2) Muhammad wrote it

3) someone else wrote it

4) Muhammad 'channelled it'

That's it. 

I see though that I have made a mistake here. It's in assuming that these debates are looking for some degree of resolution or closure. I do not - and have never on this sub or on Reddit - argue for the Islamic position. I just argue for facts. You can take or leave them... or if there are no facts (as in this case) the facts are the options above 1-4. Again take or leave.

My mistake though is doing that... because many here already have 'the Truth' and don't like to look at options.

OP Says:

I address this EXACTLY by saying that the Qur'an is poetry of a hight standard and IF Muhammad wrote it he would be a great poet... which he is not recognised as.

<TEXT> There's a problem here that not many people address and no non-Arabic speakers ever do: viz, imagine Qur'an was not a Holy Book but poetry (actually it IS poetry also) with no religious connotation - imagine Muhammad wrote it and it was presented as a work of art.

It would be up there with the canon of world literature in world cultural terms. For sure would be one of the greatest poetic masterpieces of the Middle East - and there are very, very many, some ranking alongside the greats of the West. 

So Muhammad would be one of the greatest living poets of world history. But he would have written only one thing. When all around documenting his life (many people) attest that he did not write or create and was illiterate.

It requires a conspiracy to HIDE the fact that he was one of the greatest ever poets on behalf not only of himself but very many other people with no-one ever going off-script.

Britain has an identity as a tolerant inclusive society. Attitudes that deviate from that ideal by a large degree can be seen as 'extreme'. 

I would also bet that the same people who object to this label - you may even fall into this category, I don't know - don't have any problem labelling, say, Islamists as 'extremists'.

<TEXT> Well as muslims we have to be. Everyone should be honest anyway, otherwise what's the point?

Re the Night Journey as a vision again - check this hadith from Muhammad's wife who relates he did not leave the room that night:

One of Abu Bakr's family told me that Aisha, the Prophet's wife, used to say: "The apostle's body remained where it was but God removed his spirit by night". (Ibn Ishaq, Sirat Rasulullah, p. 183).

Which clearly shows it could not have been literal. Whether muslims believe this or not is irrelevant. 

If you can prove that the majority of muslims DO believe it is literal then you would also be forced to concede that the majority of muslims do not necessarily have a deep understanding of the sources and draw their beliefs from tradition rather than Scripture. Which opens up other problems (incidentally I would agree with this view - most muslim belief is cultural at this point).

<TEXT> Well I'm a normal version and I don't. And when asked - as you did - I can cite the Qur'an to show how it was clearly a vision and point to the hundreds of historical examples of mystics (which Muhammad was, being a Prophet) who've had similar visions. 

A question for you: in all the examples of flying horses we know of from cultural tradition, do you claim that ALL of the people relating these stories believed they had a literal existence?

The poet Robert Graves for example is famous for writing "The Greek Myths" which is a modern retelling. Do you claim he believed that Pegasus literally existed?

If not why not? What makes you not do it in that case but do it in Islam's case? Is it just Mehdi Hussain? Don't know who 'Hassad' is but I think you mean him if you are talking about the guy Dawkins makes this claim of.

If you don't want us to ask questions like this, address the muslims who say it. Don't whine at us when we ask very reasonable questions about the beliefs muslims TELL us they adhere to.

I don't mind you asking questions like this? Why would I? It gives me a chance to write on a topic I love and maybe you will learn something. Maybe not - it doesn't matter. Someone may do who reads it. 

I also do discuss these issues with Muslims constantly and have done for decades. Maybe it's YOU who needs to do more of that? None of them have the view you claim they do and those that do - Hussain could be one for all I know - don't believe it in the way you claim. 

Let's try some bullet point logic:

1) I personally believe in the case under discussion it was a vision

2) Hussain MAY believe this also or may not in this specific case

3) It is irrelevant because he is talking about something else: whether he believes God is capable of manifesting a winged horse. 

4) If you believe that Allah created the universe including all designs of animals and wingless horses AND you believe He could do this again at any time AND you believe He does miracles then it would follow that He would have no problem with a winged horse. 

Why do you therefore choose 'winged horse' as your target? It's obvious a God who created everything could create a Winged Horse. Why don't you instead point to the Universe? Is far more ridiculous (in your view) to believe God created that - why not say 'Muslims believe God created the whole entire Universe - that's crazy! hahahah' ? Why just pick a winged horse?

I think there are two reasons:

1) Atheists are fixated on winning and being right. This is why they always ask for proof of things that require faith - when no proof is forthcoming 'they win the internets!'. So a Winged Horse does not exist - you win!

2) It is good to get peer approval about how rational you are and it's a useful tool to mock and portray the target as stupid. 

All a bit silly really.

<TEXT> This is a huge problem with atheist 'thought' - it is essentially literalism. Pretty much the only muslims who believe this is literal are well, literalists. We call some of them Daesh. 

Another problem is the arrogance which precludes any research. I always thought the lack of research was mainly due to 'not wanting to handle toxic substances' sort of thing. They hate religion so much they can't bear to look at it. 

If they did.. in this case, they would note two things:

1) The Qur'an explicitly states that parts of the book are metaphors and allegories and not to be taken literally. 

2) the Night Journey (that's the part where the Winged Horse appears) was a vision. 

Then I realised that it could not just be ignorance and lack of research because there are other non-Islamic things that play into this. 

The motif of the Winged Horse is a common Shamanistic motif throughout the region and throughout traditional societies historically. 

So we have: a mystic who has visons. A Shamanistic Motif. A text which states it uses metaphorical motifs. A motif known to be seen in visions.

And yet atheists and Fundie muslims still assume it is meant literally. How can that be?

It gets worse. Western scholars such as Eliade and Campbell have widely documented exactly this motif in Western contexts - Pegasus would be one example - and shown how this is a common factor in Shamanistic visionary experience. 

They don't talk about Islam or address Muhammad. They talk about any other examples.

So it seems that even the research of leading Western thinkers is not known.

That flies with some ignorant backwater muslim fundie.... but if you want to claim some higher 'cancer-free' rational superiority it's kind of embarrassing you don't know this stuff and ask silly questions no?

<TEXT> The Church? Here they are major players in property and business - Opus Dei is pretty big - and they control lots of stuff even in the Crisis but the major thing is the sex scandals which I'm sure you've heard of. 

Basically pedophile priests were running rampant molesting kids in their care and covering it up over decades. When it came out the Vatican recalled some of the priests and disappeared them (ie hid them from the authorities).

In another case here in the last few years was widespread and systematic theft of babies by nuns. I'm not making it up. 

This is just one example, there are literally dozens going back decades.

<TEXT> So is it more or less likely that this universe is unique? Why or why not? Why does it alter or affect your belief it isn't mentioned (directly) that there were several created?

In Islam it is pretty much accepted that there are numerous universes. Allah is referred to as "Lord of all the Worlds" and there are multi-universe theories by muslim thinkers going back to the 11th century. Most famous is probably al-Raziw who argued for multiple universes against Aristotle.

Lastly, have you considered that the human being is only a sub-type of a being category? 

Again, stated in Qur'an that this is the case and other beings - such as Djinn - exist.

<TEXT> Atheists, at least where I live, are not treated that great, and rarely feel comfortable telling other people that's what they think. 

Sorry to hear that. Are you in the US? I'm in Europe and don't notice this aspect so much. I think Europe has a stronger tradition of humanist thought in some areas. Where I am it's kind of not really cool not to be an atheist... all the more so as the Catholic Church here is responsible for some major league BS and everyone knows it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are the beliefs of Islam true beliefs about the real world?

It depends what you mean I suppose. I guess they don't conflict otherwise you would not have the advances of Islamic science that laid the foundation for the Renaissance: algebra, algorithms, chemistry etc...

All of those advancements stemmed from Islamic belief in a way that would have been impossible in Christian traditions for theological reasons. 

These are 'Islamic beliefs' to me as there is no conflict between science and Islam - muslims even advanced a theory of evolution hundreds of years before Darwin. That would be an 'Islamic belief' too.

If you mean the statements of the Qur'an then there's a lot of leeway. Qur'an itself claims that parts of it are not literal and are metaphorical. It says only some parts are literal but does not say which... so there's a choice there. You're allowed any opinion on it (unless you're a Wahabi lol).

Also this hadith from Muhammad:

"The Quran possesses an external appearance and a hidden depth, an exoteric meaning and an esoteric meaning. This esoteric meaning in turn conceals an esoteric meaning so it goes on for seven esoteric meanings (seven depths of hidden depth)."

Which is taken to mean that some people can perceive things on very different levels that might even contradict. 

Another one from a famous Imam:

"The book of God comprises four things: the statement set down, the allusions, the hidden meanings relating to the supra-sensible world, and the exalted spiritual doctrines. The literal statement is for the ordinary believers. The allusions are the concern of the elite. The hidden meanings pertain to the friends of God. The exalted spiritual doctrines are the province of the prophets."

I'm not posting the above to prove anything or to claim it is true but more to show that there is room for all sorts of approaches in an Islamic context.

<TEXT> But as I understand it one can't hold this view and be Muslim.

In general that's true. But it's more tricky. Most ordinary muslims aren't interested in theology or philosophy but the history of Islamic philosophy has delved pretty far into this and if were to take a philosophical rather than 'everyday' view then the issue becomes much more complex. 

For a start there can be no evil in Islam. God is wholly good and the only existent reality. There is no Satan in opposition (Satan's role is very different) and thus no Fall, no rebellion, no original sin and thus no independent evil. 

Following on from that, whatever happens is from God. Must be. Very wide Islamic belief... every muslim believes this. Everything that happens is the Will of God. It can't be ascribed to Satan or whatever as in Christianity. So it's God. All of it.

Of course no muslim is going to call it 'evil' (and nor would I) but if you ask a muslim "is X that happened God's Will" and cite something that YOU think is evil then of course we would say it's God's will. 

It's deeper than that but it's kind of an overview because I don't want to bore people or rabbit on about Islamic philosophy and I'm sure no-one else wants me to either.

<TEXT> Please tell us how we should know that Muslim beliefs are correct.

I don't understand the question. 

I'll try to address it though. I suppose in life that some people go looking for answers to questions. Some don't. No worries. No-one has to. But if you feel drawn to it then according to one's life's experience one conducts a search which becomes your personal narrative... it may lead one person to atheism and another to Buddhism or whatever. 

I really don't see what 'correct' has to do with it. I have never even considered using it as a benchmark. I am quite happy to say Islam is right for me and atheism right for you. For you - providing you are sincere - atheism is your truth. Why would I need to prove 'my truth' to you when you have one of your own.

<TEXT> The standard view in Islam is that people who do not hold the correct views and follow the correct practices are destined for eternal hellfire.

Strange. As a Muslim I know of no such doctrine. My understanding after decades of studying Islam is that Hell is not eternal in any way but commensurate to whatever bad deeds one has done. 

Also 'correct views' have nothing to do with it... unless you mean in a wider sense.  Qur'an states Christians and Jews will go to heaven so I guess the definition of 'correct views' is quite wide. 

And that probably the majority of human beings - certainly billions of them - are destined for this fate.

Not by the above scale if you include the groups listed in Qur'an: Christians, Jews, Muslims, Sabians and others. Probably covers vast majority of religious thought. And even then, as I say, Hell is temporary. 

And you think that God might be laughing at this?

This is a good example of what I was talking about earlier. I referenced something completely different with that comment. I think you know that, I give you that credit. 

English is not my first language but I like to think I express myself quite well. The God laughing comment was - as you know but are not admitting - directed at the concept of how God could view the existence of Good/Evil. 

But it was a 'thought exercise' and works even if we accept your premises. The discussion is about the existence of **GOD** and not the existence of the **ISLAMIC** or **CHRISTIAN** GOD. 

There is a possibility that God could exist and actually BE Evil. Why not? Why limit yourself to denying the Abrahamic God? Why not deny ALL possible iterations?

You don't want to leave any gaps right?

<TEXT> As far as reasons go it's a good one. If I was arriving at beliefs for reasons then I'd probably agree and be an atheist. 

I think most believers who claim proof are not being honest as there can't be any. If I felt it was necessary I'd reject it all. I'm quite happy to admit belief is irrational in a scientific sense... the question (to me) is not so much is there proof but 'does everything HAVE to be rational?'

Personally for me they don't. Not everything. Irrationality is very under-rated. Even atheists go there sometimes ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right... and that is related to proof to you? I guess I'd not have that take on it. 

My reading is that He's a unique God to the Children of Israel. He does not deny other Gods exist, He just says they in particular should have Him alone. He doesn't really care about anyone else believing or not... He's just in a relationship with Israel. 

And even then He does not prove Himself to them - to the Prophets perhaps but the people themselves are constantly not believing. Obviously this precludes any 'proof'.

When Moses is up the Mountain he - in the context of the Biblical narrative - has 'proof' as He is talking with God. But when he gets back down he finds that (in the absence of proof - they are denied to go there or into the Tabernacle) they have started worshipping idols.

<TEXT> As a side note, as to atheists "predicating themselves in opposition," in most cases that is literally what atheism means. It's the rejection of a god-claim.

Yeah, it's a fair enough position but I meant in terms of debate it means that there isn't so much an exchange of ideas but rather one side setting up their ideas and the other demolishing it without bringing anything to the table.

It's ok sometimes but sometimes get frustrating.... and of course that's why most debates can't really go anywhere. Only one side has anything at stake too... which makes the atmosphere more loaded. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's as good a possibility as any, why not?

I think we can both agree that the Abrahamic deity's behaviour is human, all too human - and as such, mostly likely IS human. 

Probably we can also agree that any existent God would - most likely - be very alien to us. We don't expect extraterrestrial life to resemble humanity so why God? 

His reasons and motivations would be unknown to us. Conversely when we see motivations ascribed to God that are wholly understandable and work in a human context then we should perhaps be suspicious that this is perhaps less divine than earthly in origin. 

Hopefully we can agree on that, but to me, just because some people misunderstand what God is and use their nearest human equivalents doesn't mean there is nothing there any more than if you showed a camera to some primitive tribe and they thought it captured their spirits and argued that when you disproved this belief you also disproved the existence of the camera.

<TEXT> Yeah, ok. I hear you. Cuts both ways though. I rarely debate atheists because of the rudeness and snark. You just don't get that in inter-faith debates.

I'm not being rude but I think you might be blind to how rude and aggressive a lot of atheists come across as and in this specific thread. I admit I might tend to generalise in such debates (and that's not good) but that's due to two things:

1) In a non-atheist debate context I've pretty much had to grow a thick skin due to some hardcore Muslim hate. Not saying it's happening here but it happens elsewhere and sometimes I carry my defence mechanisms over into other areas. My fault no doubt.

2) A lot of atheist debate is characterised by some pretty aggressive attitudes - they seem to have a very 'male swagger' to them but maybe that's just me - and also a marked 'desire to win' as opposed to an examination of ideas for it's own sake. 

Personally I love 'playing with ideas' and can even do it in any religious context. I could do it with atheists too but they seem to not be able to go there - it becomes about 'winning the debate' and 'proof' and all sorts of other BS rather than the fun of ideas in themselves. Also I think they don't really have any ideas as such but predicate themselves in opposition to other ideas they don't accept. 

So that makes for a pretty antagonistic environment. No excuse. I should be more acquiescent and chilled no doubt. But on the plus side I have dialled it down several notches from what I'm tempted to be like. So that's good right?

<TEXT> I generally find the Catalans to be reasonable about this issue actually. You can debate with them and it's all cool.

99% of the time the real rabid fanatics are expat Brits for some reason. One time I was in the queue at Verdi cinema saying to a friend that I was not in favour of Independence (perfectly legitimate view btw and one that 50% of Catalans share and all my Catalan friends do)  when I was very rudely interrupted by a girl foaming at the mouth telling me to 'Go Home if I don't like it'.

This exact phrase was shouted at me on another occasion by a well known British literary figure who'd been cosying up to me in a rather nauseating manner before they found out my stance on this issue. I have other examples too. 

I've thought about why this might be - you can discuss with the actual Catalans reasonably but the fanatics are generally non-Catalan - and the only thing I've come up with is the old Arab proverb:

In the kingdom of the one-legged, the two-legged man had better be the best at hopping.

<TEXT> Thank you. Great points. Agreed.

On a tangential issue, I sometimes think we get confused in these debates. We clarify God as Abrahamic etc but we also should make a distinction between 'God as defined by various religions' and 'God as a possible existent being'. Sometimes we get cross-wired.

Clearly the Abrahamic God would be dependent on being susceptible to proof as you say, that is one of His characteristics in an implied sense, but 'God' in the wider sense could be anything. He might not even know we exist let alone be thinking of proof.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I asked a rhetorical question as a possibility and - despite the manic downvoting - no-one has actually given their opinion that this can't be the case and reasons why they think that. So there's that. 

I am not saying anything. Just giving one possibility out of the many possibilities which would not require proof. 

Clearly people here think that if God exists He *MUST* want to prove His own existence but there seems to be no coherent or rational argument behind this. 

Perhaps the animus under which some are operating is precluding a complete overview of all possibilities. Or else they assume I believe this and are - again - asking for 'proof' which would be kind of irrational but funny also in a Pomo kind of way. </TEXT>

Or maybe we can? Nietzsche had a stab at it and other philosophers have addressed it but for the majority of humanity the good/evil thing seems hardwired and we don't know why.

Btw, it is easy to prove that good/evil does not have an absolute existence. It's purely a conditioned morality and many indigenous cultures - head-hunter societies for example - feel equal remorse and guilt when failing to do something we view as 'evil'.

<TEXT> I agree. In Christianity the problem of evil is a real spoke in the wheel of the schemata and they have never really resolved it. It can't be done. If evil exists independent of God and He is on the side of good then Good and Evil are things separate to Him and he is subordinate to one or the other.

Islam sidesteps this trap by having no Good/Evil as independent existences. There are good and bad actions that humans can do - and God advises to do one over the other but if something appears to be 'evil' then it is also part of God's plan (how can it not be?) and only *seems* evil from our perspective. We can't know the bigger picture.

<TEXT> Good points - I'll post re the first ones in a bit but want to address this:

I would ask though, is the baggage of the Islamic doctrine acceptable? If it's possible to carry on the tradition of magick without the baggage of Islam, I think it's better to do so, at least if there is an opportunity for it. If you live in a diehard Muslim area, like say in Saudi, you better claim that you're a Muslim no matter what if you want to keep your head, and then if you're a magick practitioner, you have little choice if you want to keep your head, but to cast what you are doing in Islamic terms. This isn't something to be proud of. It's a concession to the local brutality, and nothing more.

It depends on what you think the 'baggage' is. If you think Saudi is a typical example then obviously the answer would be no. But Saudi are essentially a local cult from the 18th century who the British bolstered in the first instance and then they got lucky with the discovery of oil. Were it not for these two factors no-one would ever think this is Islam. 

Certainly their sect is very small. Only 60% or so of Saudis themselves identify with the ruling ideology and in wider world terms it represents a small percentage of Muslim belief. 

Oth, magic is quite well integrated into North African Muslim societies and certainly used to be in Iraq and Syria. Of course you need to 'keep your head' but that is because magicians actually are very visible in these contexts. And it's only since the rise of Wahabism and also Daesh in the wake of the US wars that this needs to be a concern. Before that there was no problem.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a hypothetical case - would it not be possible to conceive that the issue is not one of belief vs unbelief with the latter group joining the former after being 'convinced' but, rather the issue could be one group who have not had a certain experience vs a group that has. 

Of course many of the people who claim to have had the experience in various religions very likely haven't - so that's a problem. </TEXT>

Another bit I like is:

All Faith is false, all Faith is true:
Truth is the shattered mirror strown
In myriad bits; while each believes
His little bit the whole to own.

<TEXT> Jesus isn't a religion. Christianity is a religion. Was Jesus trying to start a religion? I would argue: no. Of course there was some visionary stuff going on where Jesus appeared after the bodily death and said something like "OK, please start a Church, will ya?" But I have to dispute the ownership of this line.

Ok, I agree with this. Jesus was not starting a religion (other religious figures like Muhammad were in some sense though and I equate the two as from the same source but let's look at Jesus). He was teaching a group of disciples which became a community. This community preserved and transmitted his teaching - in the Jerusalem Church under the guidance of his brother and other groups.

We don't know if he authorised these groups but we do know that esoteric knowledge is passed down in this way - it's a 'chain' as it were from teacher to student stretching way back. 

My claim that religion is a legitimate entity is that religion (not the Church - the ideology) IS the teaching. Somewhat embroidered and falsified in places but it contains the original teaching in part. I see religion as a Ferrari (say) where the people who are now the 'Authorised Owner's Club' don't know how to drive and haven't for centuries. You can say they are lying when they claim to be able to drive. They are. You can say they do it for power. They do. But you can't (imo) argue it isn't a Ferrari.

I agree with a lot of your points actually. I think you're pretty spot on but the acid test would be whether someone could work with the teachings of the Church - unchanged - in a magical context and gain some degree of enlightenment. I am not a Christian but I have experience of people who have done this so I would argue they could.

Same for Islam which is the tradition I work in. Of course you can go the ISIS route or be some mad mulla in Saudi. But again, I know people reading the same texts and doing the same practices who are very advanced and enlightened magical practitioners.

Picking up a spellbook without inner work and inner change might work because of other factor but is not (imo) real magic in the sense I define it.

<TEXT> I hear you. But I see some problems. I can see (and agree) how you can apply this definition -"Religion is an attempt to regulate and normalize the magical tendencies of the sentient beings." - to the Church. No worries.

Applying it to Jesus is more problematic no? Or would you go there?

If not, then on what basis do you make the Church representative of religion over the founder?

If you see them as the same - Jesus and the Church - I find that hard to square with a magical world view. 

You see the problem?

<TEXT> I don't agree there. You have to define what religion **IS** first. 

if you take all the examples commonly used of how it is fucked up: ISIS, fundie loons, the Pope, whatever - you can prove quite easily that these are not in line with the teaching of the founder and are often the polar opposite. 

So once you realise that the bad examples aren't actually following a religion then it's just a matter of seeing whether *anyone* actually is. They may be, may not. Need to take out the trash first in order to see. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think Crowley's conception of "the great work" is much higher then merely "gaining things."

Yeah, I agree. I should have qualified it... I was meaning magic in the popular imagination and wider public view. Not many people who are not interested in occultism see magic as a spiritual path... mostly they think Harry Potter. 

But you're right. I should have been more clear. Was assuming it was more of a non-magical audience lol. 

Offensive is probably strong: you must know there are whole systems of magic (cough) Chaos Magick for example, that are predicated on just that. And what are spells if not for attracting something? They are fairly ubiquitous... not everything is High Magic.

I'm not saying this is my take on it - just that it is a common perception and one a lot of so-called magicians seem to share regardless of Bardon, Crowley et al. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One reason: because the reasons *why* a person would give such a demonstration would be the same reasons which  make such things fail. 

I don't know why it is but I have proved it to myself many times. As an example: I can, through a specific method (doesn't matter what) take a newspaper, check the Racing pages and predict which horse will win which race with a 90% accuracy more or less.

If I do this with someone observing to show them it or - especially - if I bet on the horse, the horse will lose. That's pretty much 100% rate. 

I have other experiments in this too, this one is just an example. 

I don't really believe in **The Secret Chiefs** but sometimes I am tempted to believe that there is an operative force of 'someone' stopping these things from happening publically or being 'proved'. 

Maybe you need some sort of permission. Who knows. In any event, I know for sure that if you can do certain things magically then something kicks-in to stop this if it is done publicly as it were.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> and yet you are a muslim...

I think that is probably more of a problem for you than for me. It is fairly routine Islamic theology and has been for 1400 years. 

The basis of Islam is even the *shahada* - "There is no God...... except God".

It's kind of the one fundamental point. All else is pretty much subordinate. There are huge schools of philosophy on just this point - Ibn Tamiyah for example:

God is distinct from His creation; nothing of Him resides in it, nor is there any of His creation in Him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm guessing I'm just failing to see the point. You say God isn't a thing, but then how do you know anything at all about God?

I personally don't think you do - for sure. But the mindset is not a materialistic one, it's a move away from that. "Proof" or "being sure" is not important. 

I don't say it isn't for *some* religionists - they can sink into literalism and materialist views as much as anyone. But I would argue that their views are contrary to the views of the founder.

How do you know Jesus or Mohammad weren't made up, or at least the claims they make about the supernatural? 

Does it matter? They could be 'made up'. It's irrelevant - Jesus spoke in parables all the time. Does it matter if they were 'true'? Maybe in those days there were also a bunch of people laughing at him saying 'prove that happened - you made it up'. Of course he made it up - that's the point. 

It's not about whether it's true... it's about what you can get from it. And likewise, if these guys were proved to be 'made up' then nothing would change (for me). Because it's about what they're portraying. Whether they had historical existence or not doesn't impact what they represent. 

If there really is some super awesome extra consciousness that is out there, what exactly will thinking it help us do? Be more peaceful? Find purpose or self-worth?

That's a question each person who feels the urge to find out must answer for themselves. My answer would not be your answer. And maybe it is not an important question for you? Only the individual can judge that. 

Also, how certain are you on a scale of 0-100% that 'God' the concept really describes something tangible and true and real? Does doubt prevent you from being sure?

Doubt and belief does not really come into it. I think if you do certain things then you get - say - Experience X. This experience is not God but it is an experience where you are aware of many things you are not normally aware of. One of them is something you could give a label to like 'Universe', 'Mind', 'Reality' or whatever. I just choose the word 'God' because I relate to it but it is nothing much in common with the God atheists are claiming does not exist - as I say, I don't believe in that God either.  </TEXT>

Well that's what magic is concerned with - in some definitions it's a rejection of such statements as you just made.

A magician would say to this that of course you are correct and magic does not exist - for you. Because *we are all* magicians and we create our reality. 

You are just creating a reality where the only reality that exists is the only one you can see.

<TEXT> How do you know, that if you spent a lot of time studying this magic, that you have reached this higher consciousness? 

You know because you already have it. You *remember* it when you're in it... mostly states and feelings you had as a child.

Do they provide information that was only attainable through this state, or can it be discovered in any way?

They don't really provide - they tell you a technique (a specific meditation say) which might not be commonly available and what you get from that when you practice it is unique to you. It's almost like this 'Holographic Universe' idea where you are the sole protagonist. But I don't know what I think about that... it's problematic for me but it seems like that. 

 Do you trust your teachers that they've reached this higher consciousness?

Definitely not. Don't trust anything you can't prove to yourself. It doesn't matter about them at a certain level anyway. It's about personal effort - they can't put that effort in for you. You have to do it yourself. 

Could factors like the sunk cost fallacy or confirmation bias lead you to believing that you've reached a higher consciousness when in reality you've just spend a lot of time thinking making you more aware of things.

Definitely. I think a lot of 'gurus' and others are in this boat. They convince themselves and then their disciples bolster it. 

But the main thing that happens I think is that you realise there is no 'higher consciousness' - I don't mean that in some woo-woo way but more that there is no end to it. It's all relative. Compared to someone you may be advanced, to someone else far behind. 

Life is too short for you to reach 'the end' and there may not be one - so instead it becomes a more measured effort to self-improve rather than 'get to the end' if that makes sense. Part of the journey is realising you're never going to be Jesus or Buddha but you can be a better you every day when you wake up - you won't but you decide to live with that goal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Care to tell me what you know about God?

Difficult one. First thing I think to say is that it's just a word. I'll revert to an Islamic terminology - not for any partisan reason but because I'm most comfortable expressing that. 

'Allah' is not a name but just the word for 'God' in the abstract. Jews and Christians use the same word so it's not uniquely Islamic - if this chat was in Arabic you'd use that word in your post above. 

This word can also mean 'Truth' or 'Reality' - it doesn't betoken anything in itself. I take it to mean 'the thing which will exist when everything else ceases to exist' which is another Islamic way of saying it. 

We can't know 'God' because God is not a 'thing' - everything you can conceive of that exists is a 'thing'. If you made a list of all these that ever existed and ever could or will - 'God' will not be on that list. 

So, to me (and this is just me, other may disagree), the process of religion is not a faith or belief but a method of finding how to bridge that gap between us as 'things' and 'no thing'.  Many systems attempt this - Zen, meditation etc.... people attempt it with drugs. There are alternate forms of consciousness and you don't need drugs to access them. To me, magic, spirituality, all these things are methods to access these supra-normal modalities of seeing. 

Of course most religionists in the mosque or at Mass aren't doing this and would object to it....even scream blasphemy, but if you study religious texts objectively then it is clear that was what the founders like Jesus and Muhammad were doing. 

Religion can still work for this but we don't really need it now. There are other ways - I think even an atheist can access these realities though obviously they would not call it God and, depending on their investment, might try to rationalise it. But, as I say, they're often hung up on opposing the 'old man on the cloud' and if you can get them looking up at the stars in the desert (so to speak) they feel the same awe generally. They just don't call that God because they've been conditioned to use that word only for certain contexts. But they can feel it just the same. 

I would say that if we can live in our 'real perception' then we can answer these questions easier. None of us really do. Sometimes we're doing something banal and we just 'wake up' and feel totally alive, wondering why we don't feel like that all the time... next thing we're back asleep again for weeks... sleepwalking through life. 

If we were 'awake' more often we'd know more. Magic and other systems are just methods of bringing these states about.

<TEXT> How do you study magic? Can you define magic?

You need to find a system to study - there are many - and follow that system, either in a group, under a teacher or a sole practitioner. 

I studied Franz Bardon for a while - basically the curriculum begins with meditation and you master successive stages (making your mind blank, being able to have no thoughts etc) which can take many years. There's elements of yoga and sitting in various postures - all supposed to lead to a mastery of the mind and body and a subsequent change in consciousness. The theory is that this change of consciousness gives insights and access to 'another world'. It's roughly mappable to the Buddhist concept of Enlightenment but not quite. 

For me this is the definition of magic: a system like Zen, yoga, whatever that is designed to lead to some form of higher consciousness. Unlike those systems however which are moral/spiritual in tone, magic focusses also on 'gaining things'.

It's my opinion (I could be wrong) that this element - spells for money etc - is not actually real and, though it can work, is designed to 'tempt' people or test the student. You COULD do this sort of thing but the aim is to bypass it. It's a trap - thats why you see many self-professed magicians who are not rich and have money problems. 

Magic is essentially a spiritual path but one which - again, just my opinion, could be wrong - leads to God. So it sits well with religion imo. My main interest is in  Islamic Magic and I don't see any conflict with mainstream Islam with it - many Muslims do though. But they'd say the same about Sufism.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh missed that. It's definitely one of the classics. I think the evidence is pretty overwhelming and he conclusively argues his case imo.

Not much since then in a Christian context. I recommend "Magic in Islam" by Michael Muhammad Knight which just came out and is interesting from an Islamic perspective. 

Islam has a different take than Christianity as djinn are held to be not like demons and can be good or bad or Muslim/Christian even. So there is a large tradition of djinn-related magic in an Islamic and pre-Islamic context.

And then there's the Shamanic subtext which is borderline magical. The life of Muhammad in the traditions overlaps almost seamlessly with traditional accounts of the Shamanic initiation - is a fascinating study.  </TEXT>

Early Gnosticism also can lay claim to being an authorative Christian iteration - all the more so since its suppression by the emerging Church. Gnosticism is hardcore magic in essence.

<TEXT> Very often atheist use words intended to insult which *they themselves* would find insulting - they can't seem to grasp that they might not be insulting to the recipient necessarily. 

When someone calls religion a 'fairy tale' I'm thinking 'yeah.. of course'. It's like they've never heard of Campbell or Jung and don't have any connection to the Imaginal - which unfortunately is often the case in actuality. 

It can get quite hilarious in some cases - taken to the ultimate degree extreme hardcore cases go frothing about a God that no religionist ever believed in but only exists in their own minds. I have yet to have a debate with an atheist where I ask them what God they disbelieve in and I end up thinking 'yeah, I don't believe in that crap either'. 

Re Magic: to me it refers to a system which claims to be able to enable a person to impose their will on objects and people through non-material means as a by-product of a certain form of self-development. I have no problem with it at all. Religion is not magic *per se* but the two do overlap.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So what was the point of this debate? To point out to me that you're a special unique snowflake?

For me the point was to debate and get other's views and maybe connect with some cool people - which I did. 

I guess for you it was to label people and reinforce your position. All cool.

Thanks, not my first language.

No worries.... not my mother-tongue either. Just happened to pick that one up as I'm called that a lot.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well it's inherent in Islamic belief. The foundation is that we cannot know God so we don't actually know what He is like except from inference. 

Also, God is dynamic in that He is not limited and could change the rules - most Muslims believe He won't but they can't (unless they are reductionist fundies) believe he *can't*. 

So one must constantly use Reason and seek knowledge. It's less belief than a way to live or a path. Most Westerners, let alone atheists, don't grasp that so well as they're conditioned to Judeo-Christianity.

I've enjoyed talking to you btw - a convo where you can leave feeling some common ground and no entrenched conflict is a real breath of fresh air and it's great we've been able to do it if even for only a little while. Especially here... is very inspiring!

I get that. You're playing rugby and get to pick up the ball and run. I'm playing soccer and that's not in my rules.

I don't think you're game is better than mine or mine yours. I don't think there is 'one true game' and you enjoying yours - or even claiming that your game's rules apply to every game there ever could be - does not impact the way I play my game at all.

I can't apply my rules to your game. And you can't apply yours to mine. The difference is you think you can.

<TEXT> True... I also envy atheists sometimes. Not the certainty, you can get that in religion, and certainly not the dogmatism (ditto) but atheism at it's best is sometimes more 'in the moment'. Religion aims at this too but too much gets in the way - atheism (the old school variety anyway) can sometimes be much purer. 

I'm not an agnostic though btw, raised a Christian by fundie evangelicals and found may way to Islam around the age of 18. 30 years ago plus.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My theoretical belief system is asinine and ridiculous. Could you imagine if I started making laws based on these beliefs?

Well I think people *HAVE* made laws based on asinine and ridiculous beliefs. I part company with you on this if you're seriously trying to argue our moral and legal systems are somehow not control-systems put in place to keep the elite in a class above the rabble. Religion serves the same purpose - it's a double-whammy.... both are equally fallacious. 

So, can't see how it would be much different. I guess you'd be stealing off your own people rather than other countries but pretty much business as usual. In any event all it would do is give **everyone** a mandate to do what only the elite have permission to do as it is now. No moral difference at least... might be more fair. Even distribution of stolen goods. 

I could be following the words of a complete madman.

Undoubtedly you are in some areas. Lots of madmen out there. But then it depends on your definition of 'mad'. Mine is probably far broader than yours by the sound of it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> hm, you can prove that earth is spherical - get in the middle of a large plain or sea, or on any high point where nothing stops you from seing the horizon - you'll see that the horizon is a circle around you, and that is applicable to any point on earth. 

Is it though? I don't think it's that simple. I've been listening lately to some Flat Earth podcasts.... I don't believe it and they're clearly batshit crazy but that's not the point: the point is that they can convince themselves and argue their position rationally. Again, I don't believe them but I don't have proof either way and am not interested in that. 

It's not as simple as invoking science - that does not deter these guys. 

The case about a friend is not a different case - it is about you believing he is not able to kill or you believing he is not lying. That is trust - extrapolating the good you've witnessed of this person before to the current situation.

I disagree. I might know he is a killer of other people but believe him in this case because I choose to believe he doesn't lie to me. Many possibilities. 

And yes, since the people who teach about god are religious leaders, they matter when talking about god.

To you they might matter. To me not at all. In fact I don't think they teach about God in the least generally speaking. You are not religious or a believer in God I guess... if you were then you might be able to tell why they aren't. Lots of them are just con-men with no faith at all. Believing what they try to portray about themselves is as foolish as believing a politician cares about the lives and welfare of his constituents.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, you are saying you don't care if this is true, but you still believe it? you allow for a possibility that it is not true yet you believe it?

If we are talking about God then yes... I don't feel a need for proof of God in any way and believe in the existence of such a being without any necessity of proof. I think I've always felt this. 

If you mean a specific religious teaching then that's different - obviously, rationally, I can see how many of them are adjusted and utilised as power-structures or whatever. I'd make a distinction between 'religion' and 'God' in some ways. 

And no, sorry, i cannot concieve of any other option. Why would I?

Yes, is an interesting question. I don't know... why would you? I've asked hardcore religionists something similar - they can't imagine any options other than their particular world-view either. I think rigid systems will do this.

If you honestly believe in elves and unicorns then, I guess, believing is god (gods) is understandable, too. But why people never see them?

Obviously I also believe that people do see them. That follows on from the question and answer no? Again though, I don't think people who see them are interested in 'proving' it. 

I have a question of my own - why do you need to believe in god? there is nothing around you in your everyday life that cannot be explained without god - why would you even consider the existence of god possible?

Good question. I think that the question of God arises naturally. That is to say (I speak for myself only here ymmv) I think if I was brought up somehow on a desert island and I somehow was educated enough to formulate the question it would naturally arise. I think when you look up at the stars and wonder the question is a natural one: "is there something more...." is there something "bigger" than me/us?

I think there is. I don't need proof of it and it's not a need. It's just how I answer the question. Maybe God doesn't even know we exist. 

We talked for about three hours, and we could not understand how the other one lives with his/her beliefs/atheism

Yeah, this is what I meant above. I am not trying to be disrepectful to you or say you should change your view in any way but surely an atheist (or religionist) who can totally see and understand all other options is somehow more 'free' (for want of a better word) than one who can only see their own?

Maybe, it is because I was raised in an atheist family and an atheist country, and he was born and raised in a religious environment, I don't know.

Could be. But maybe atheism is your Truth. It might not be 'true' in an absolute sense - in fact nothing may be. I often wonder that if we could somehow 'see it all' then all the talk of God, atheism, religion and all other human ideals would be just not remotely accurate or significant. In fact this is my position - but the thing that is outside of all that... I call God. That's all there is too it really.... it's not about belief at all, it's more that I think there's something more than 'us' and 'this'.

<TEXT> But in this case a wise person would know that he does exactly this. An honest person will say "I want to believe, because belief gives me comfort, not because I know that my beliefs are true".

But they would still have to take the position they are true. I believe the earth is spherical. I can't prove it and have no interest in it. It may be flat for all I know... I just choose to believe it's spherical.

When you say to your friend "I believe you"...

Different case entirely. Often you believe your friend when proof is impossible... he's going to jail for murder for example and can't prove he didn't do it. But you believe he is innocent. Is a different thing... actually this is more like the religious position. 

Now, I do believe that people preaching religion do benefit from believers, because their belief gives the preachers power. And I do not personally know the preachers to be honest and wise people.

That's kind of obvious no? I thought we were talking about the concept of a God in the abstract - not some sectarian loon who all sane people know to be most likely a con-artist. There's no connection. 

You're half-way down the road to arguing the counterfeit dollar bill proves no real one exists. Everyone knows religious leaders in the main are fucked up. 

What's that got to do with the philosophical question of God?

<TEXT> Why would you think something is true without proof?

I don't. I am not interested in 'true' or 'proof'. I think this is why Materialists often misunderstand where religionists are coming from. Can you not conceive of any other options? Really?

Give me either a reliable source or the access to primary evidence.

Why? That's like me asking you to show me Science's Revealed Holy Scripture handed down from God.

People who wrote something ages ago about things that only happened once are not a reliable source.

Never said it was. As I said... not remotely interested in 'proof' in this sense. 

See, there were also people who wrote about unicorns and mermaids, nymphs and elves. Why do you not believe them?

Actually I do.

If a woman tells you she got pregnant without having sex with a man, will you believe it? Why?

Depends on the woman and the context. These days in this climate then 100% not. But not because of the claim necessarily. More because of what we might term 'current state of humanity'

If a man told you that god spoke to him, would you believe him? Why?

I would need more data. I'd need to know what he understood by 'spoke' and 'God' and what 'God' said. But I wouldn't *disbelieve* I'd hear him out and assess it. Certainly I think it's possible.

That statement only makes sense *after* you have proved there is someone there.  I think what you mean to say is: "Seeing someone standing behind you is proof that they are there".

So you think perceiving something as being there is proof? Wow.

<TEXT> Faith is required to believe in religious ideas because there is a lack of evidence.

I think this is a misreading. It is kind of true today because there are lots of Materialists about and these don't stop being that even if they get religious but - historically, and particularly thousands of years ago - religion has not been related to faith at all. It's been related to perception of the numinous.

Granted most religious Institutions these days have moved away from that but it doesn't mean they can erase the basis of their systems.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm glad you posted this because it strikes at the heart of the very thing I am talking about. 

I criticise lots of things: Catalan Nationalism, Islamic fundamentalism and Wahabism etc - but only if they impact my life and interests. My criticism is, in effect, a way of saying " this interests me, I like this issue but I want it to be better (for Me) in way XYZ....)" I care, in short.

The main thing I am criticising in all these things might be termed as a non-thinking binary reductionist black/white mode which is a kind of moronic dumbing down which currently plagues our societies in the West and East. I love Islam but object to Islamism for example. All Islamists I discuss this with view me as anti-Islam. 

You see where I am going with this? /u/fedezen realises I have criticised certain things from which he derives a certain psychological balance - this, to him, seems to mean that I am a fascist. 

But, if he knew me (which he does not - and tellingly, this does not stop him making a dictat - his 'truth' is The Truth and will continue to be even after this posting no doubt) he would also know I am very active in Antifa and Left-wing radical politics. 

But - for him - this is impossible to be the case. It just doesn't enter his consciousness as a *possibility* because I have criticised something which is at the core of his being. Therefore I must be the opposite to him. I must be the thing he hates (ie some form of imagined and constructed Francoist - the bogeyman in his closet - which has no existence other than that with which he imbues it) because otherwise we would have that troublesome worm in the apple called 'nuance'. 

We're all fundamentalists now I suppose.

<TEXT> Yes, but they haven't really thought it through have they? 

The Islamic God does not really have any characteristics that are not shared by the Christian God - if you discount the Trinity which many early Christian groups did not adhere to either. 

In another sense, in Islam, God is the thing 'which does not pass away' - and is unknowable. If any other Gods also have that characteristic of continuing to exist when all else has ceased to be, then this is the same thing philosophically.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a dream once which seemed very long. I had committed a crime and I had to consequently join the Army. My job there was assigned as a bomb-disposal expert.

Me and my partner had to find an defuse a certain bomb and we hunted for this bomb through ruined bombed-out houses. After a certain number of these searches we found a bomb in a basement and picked it up to take it back to base for some reason. 

Someone was chasing us and I was carrying the bomb. We went from house to house hiding - all the time trying to avoid the person and stop the bomb from going off.... I was acutely aware it was on a timer and we had to avoid this pursuer and get rid of the bomb before it exploded. 

This went on for a while, hiding in houses, running down streets and eventually we were near Base - but we never made it. The bomb exploded with an alarm sound (ie it was not an explosion but the alarm WAS the explosion) and I woke up instantly with the real life alarm going off.

<TEXT> Allah is just the word for 'God' in the abstract. Arabic-speaking Jews and Christians use it and if you look in an Arabic Bible you will see this is the word the Christians use and which Jesus uses also. 

It is not a name - it just means 'God'. An Arabic speaking atheist would use it to describe the concept regardless of religious context.

It cannot therefore be derived from the moon god trope - this is a typically ignorant idea promulgated by US right-wing Christians who know nothing of the world outside the US let alone religions other than the one the claim (wrongly) to profess - which depends on the uniquely Islamic context and the 'personal name' (like Jehovah) misreading. 

The Arabic for 'God' and 'god' - let alone 'moon god' also have nothing in common linguistically but that's yet another story.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting points. 

I don't know much about Christian theology. Is there held to be a point at which God evolved a plan to sacrifice His son as it were? Or is this held to be a plan from the beginning in the light of some sort of foreknowledge?

I think the latter no? I'm not aware of a teaching that shows God as reacting to human sin 'in time' as it were but surely this must be the case as Adam and Eve were sinless? So He must have come up with this plan as a reaction to the Fall at some point?

That's all fine as far as it goes but why did He stop? Why can't He say (for example) "this plan didn't work - far too many people are still going to hell, I need a new plan again" and have a Plan B?

The God who came up with Plan A (Christ's sacrifice) could surely come up with another plan but the God most Christians seem to conceive of seems incapable of this action.

Is not coherent in the theology is it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> In theory but it's not that simple - the resurrection negates the sacrifice. The whole point is that someone 'pays' by dying. And staying dead.

Unless one argues that it is the process of death as opposed to the fact of death (ie no longer partaking of life) which is the sacrifice. But philosophically this has serious flaws too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Evolution is true. It's a fact. 

Actually it's a theory. One of several that are competing models. If you are referring to Darwinism then that is just one model. There are others.

I happen to believe some form of evolution is the correct model but we don't have facts. That's why it's called a theory. 

But I agree with you in the main. I don't believe things that I cannot verify for myself but what does 'verify' mean? For me it does not necessarily equate always to scientific proof. It could mean many things.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really don't. Not until you can SHOW me that they are true. Until then you are just wasting my time.

That depends on your level of understanding surely? Something could be true but it could still be impossible to demonstrate to a five year old (say).

So if you don't take this aspect into account it might equally be possible (likely even) that it is not the demonstrator who is wasting your time but you who is wasting theirs.

Didn't read past this.. too long. But I can tell you the reason: I don't engage in pointless activities that will benefit me nothing. 

It seems you do though as if your view of Muslims is correct you are in a false position trying to reason with one.

My advice to you is to do as I do: when you are convinced someone is not worth your time just move on. 

You should not bother engaging me. It will profit you nothing except perhaps bolster your feelings of being correct and you can better get that more effectively with those who share your world view. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, true, I agree. I think that there always has to be some inflexibility (for want of a better word) or else people could go off reservation and claim orthodoxy. Now when that happens they can be safely just labelled a cult. 

Interestingly Islam does have some flexibility in some sense, if only in retrospect as it conceives that God *did* adjust revelation over time - with the Torah, Jesus and the Qu'ran which are all held to be from the same source but addressing different needs.

The Muhammad last prophet point is a good observation, never thought about it like that before.... but there is a hadith somewhere (can't find it now) that does say that in the end-times a new Book will be sent which the Muslims will find impossible to accept. Wish I could find that saying, will keep looking.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why is God 'Static' in orthodox religious paradigms? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-28 16:51:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> That is to say in the Christian Scriptures (for example), God *reacts* to situations on the ground. In one case Abraham bargains with Him to save members of a community slated for annihilation and God adjusts His plans. In other cases He changes His mind based on certain developments.

The very concept of prayer implies that God can be petitioned and thus His plans can be adjusted in some way. 

But in orthodox established religion God is seen as being static - as being *unable* to change His mind. His word binds Him. He cannot - say - decide to send His Son AGAIN to save the world. He cannot decide to NOT punish anyone and change the deal. 

Or can He?

Can He do these things and still be God? If so, why doesn't He? Why is He limited in this way in these religious views? </TEXT>

I prefer this one from Tukulti-Ninurta I (no meme - I have these in memory):

**One who has no god, as he walks along the street, Headache envelops him like a garment.**

It's carved by an empty stone throne which is highly symbolic. But I suppose in the current case there *IS* something in the God's place on the symbolic throne isn't there?

It's not God..... but it is perhaps *A* god. Of sorts.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is it realistic to try to CF a property for a Holistic Centre? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-28 13:20:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My partner and I have been working on a project for about a year which is essentially a Holistic/Educational centre for the arts (my partner and I are writers/musicians among other things) where workshops and lectures will be given. We've been thinking of renting a place but not found the right one and are turning our thoughts to the possibility of purchasing - would need around 500k realistically. 

The Centre would fund itself by organising retreats and workshops in a variety of topics with lectures by people of influence in the fields we cover: mostly music, writing and the arts. There would be a strong 'relaxation' element alongside the learning one as we propose this in some mediterrenean location.

A key part of it would be some associated land where we would have 4-5 wooden huts where people could come and stay for 12 months (for free - we would gift this) in order to finish their novel, painting or whatever. 

So my question is: is this realistic to try to crowdfund this project? I know nothing of this and we'd been assuming to rent but it is now entering our thinking to purchase a place if possible.

Anyone any tips, hints or suggestions? Much appreciated!

[The Muslim Jesus: Sayings and Stories in Islamic Literature](https://www.amazon.com/Muslim-Jesus-Literature-Convergences-Inventories/dp/0674011155)

The reason I think it's important is that in Islam there is a separate tradition about Jesus that goes back almost to the same time as Christianity does, which comes from the same region but which has not been subject to alteration by the Church. 

In a way the Islamic tradition of Jesus is what the Western one would be if the Church had not altered the original teachings and adjusted/defined the books of the Bible. 

There are many sayings of Jesus there that are not in the current or Christian or Gnostic tradition - they've been preserved intact and are virtually unknown in the West. Needless to say the Jesus they present is not exactly one the Church would recognise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a memory of knowing that the Russians put a man on the moon. The memory is not actually seeing it as I saw the US landing but rather is a recall of the knowledge I had of this - one of the things I knew - as I was growing up.

I even have a memory of finding out it wasn't true and recall being somewhat shocked - I can't recall when this was exactly but I would guess about age 12 (I was 5 when the US moon landing happened and recall seeing this).

It's an abiding memory that for a long time I 'knew' the Russians had also put a man on the moon (more than once) and though they lost the Space Race they still succeeded in getting there.

I can recall a kind of graphic image with the US flags showing the US landing and 2 (I think) Soviet flags showing their landing areas. It was in some book but again, I cannot recall which. </TEXT>

I'm thinking Bezoya is the best bottled water out there but does anyone know if the plastic they use is free from BPAs? I know Brita filters are but that doesn't really give the purity I want in terms of water - tap water here is not good. 

If the plastics are not BPA free then would filtering the Bezoya water eradicate them?

Pretty clueless on this so any input I'll be grateful for!

<TEXT> It has some merit... God is **No Thing**

".....whats wrong with at least one argument still advanced as a clincher by anti-religious polemicists. Everything must have a cause and the cause of everything must be God: so the atheist paraphrases the religious case. But, the atheist continues, if everything has a cause, so must God. Argument over: the idea of God cannot function so as to avoid an infinite regress, so the religious case falls to the ground."

"But Shortt points out that, whether or not you accept the argument in anything like this form (and he notes that recent analytical philosophers of religion have found some plausible ways of restating it), the secular advocate has misunderstood a basic point. Whatever can be said of God, God cannot by definition be another item in any series, another thing (hence the books title)."

"The claim made by religious philosophers of a certain kind is not that God can be invoked to plug a gap, but that there must be some fundamental agency or energy which cannot be thought of as conditioned by anything outside itself, if we are to make sense of a universe of interactive patterns of energy being exchanged. Without such a fundamental concept, we are left with energy somehow bootstrapping itself into being."

<TEXT> Yes, it was taken down and made into a cushion which implies that if it was haram as a curtain but not haram as a cushion (when you could still see the figures on it) then there is a difference ascribable to usage.

I tend to think that the problem was that a full length depiction of a human in the dark *could* possibly trick someone into thinking it was a real human and this would very likely be under the prohibition of 'attempting to create' life.

I think where something was clearly *not* an attempt at rivalry with God in this way it was seen at that time as ok. Also the prohibition was only really ever in a religious context - which is why there are thousands of paintings of the Prophets but has never been an illustrated Qur'an or mosque. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. No. 

2. No such command. 

There are many depictions of the Prophet. I could link you to about 10 right now off the top of my head. 

It is - supposed to be - part of a wider ban on depicting images and applies not specifically to the Prophet but to all human forms. The thinking behind it is kind of literalist: that the only point in making an image of a person would be to try to rival God by creating something. Obviously not something allowed. 

Clearly though the early Muslims did not think that this was the point of creating such an image. 

Muhammad let A'isha play with dolls, had cushions in his home with human figures on, protected the painting of Mary and Jesus in the Kaaba from destruction. Omar had a censer for incense in the mosque with human figures on. 

And many other examples - as well as the hundreds of paintings we have of prophets and people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The fact that ISIS kills other Muslims doesn't make them any less Islamic. Look at Islam's history and you will find lots of instances of Muslims killing other Muslims and still being considered authentic Islamic movements or branches of the religion.

I was not claiming they were less Islamic because they killed other Muslims. 

I'll be clearer: If person A kills person B over a dispute over who is 'right' because they have opposing views then at least one of them is 'wrong'.

I'm sure there's been many revivalist movements within Islam that have sought to 'set it all right. Just look at the Wahabis.

ISIS are Wahabi

Likewise ISIS is operating based upon their reading of the Koran, and they are not the first Muslims to promote this interpretation.

*upon their reading of*

I think this is why psychic abilities can't be replicated in a lab. No emotional build-up.

Btw - I don't mean to say emotional build-up is not part of it, it is - but it's not where it happens... that happens when you 'wear it out' as it were and go beyond it. It's essential to have the emotional part in order to transcend it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's more about what Obama's understanding of the term Islamic is, not mine.

Well yours plays into it as I think is reflected in your question - it would not be confusing if there was general consensus would it? At the very least, as you admit, your understanding is different to Obama's so one of you at least is wrong. 

Obama claimed that ISIS was not Islamic. By this he meant that they were somehow not reflective of the teachings of Islam. Based his logic then should it follow that the Inquisition could also be said to not have been Christian?

So are they reflective of the teachings of Islam? I would say clearly not. 

I don't have to quote Hadith and Qur'an here (though that could certainly work as an argument) we can just use logic:

* ISIS kill Muslims
* The rationale for this is that these Muslims are not really Muslims - ie not ISIS
* So one of these groups is *not Islamic*
* Which one is most likely? A new group arising after 1400 years or the communities that have existed since the early days of Islam (ie the ones getting killed)?
* Following on from this, if ISIS are the true Muslims, and they only just showed up - how could Islam be the 'false Islam' for 1400 years? With nobody trying to set it all right till the 21st Century? Did it only just get noticed now?

We can do the Scripture thing with your Inquisition meme:

Jesus (founder of Christianity): Do not kill. Love your enemies. Forgive those that do you wrong. 

Inquisition (Product of Schismatic Sect 1000 years or more later: we are going to kill, torture and not forgive. 

I suppose it comes down to what point you need to make how you deploy this info but I am pretty sure you'll see some contradiction. Again, the question is more which one is more likely to be correct - the original idea of the founder or a doctrine that contradicts from centuries later.

In a historical sense Obama is obvious wrong in his understanding. I think that the Inquisition should be considered a Christian issue, just as ISIS should be thought of as being an Islamic one.

Interesting. How do you get from the Sermon on the Mount to the Inquisition - theologically. What is the process? 

I know many right-wing US 'Christians' are into guns and war and think Jesus would be the same but here's the thing: they're batshit crazy. And they can't justify their position. 

Can you? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, but I should clarify. I don't mean to say that Muslim groups and sects have not created dogma but rather that they are free to do so as the minimum requirements of belief leave them a blank canvas to do so as it were. 

I think the idea of Allah/God as creator is kind of a side-issue in Classical Islamic thought. It's not that He's not seen in that role but more that it doesn't really matter because the only existent thing is essentially God. Or rather, Islam envisages a time where everything that ever existed will no longer exist. Except God. 

I don't think the mythic view is really in line with Feynman. More possibly akin to Joseph Campbell. 

The idea is not that God was invented to explain anything at all - the Muslim thinkers had science for that - but rather the conception is more that they think there is a non-material 'space' which they see as the Imaginal realm, a liminal place which they relate somehow to the cause of being. This is called *alam al-mithal* - interestingly Dune uses this motif, speaking of sci-fi:

http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Alam_al-Mithal

The Imaginal realm is a place where archetypes manifest as signs and can thus communicate with the 'real world' though this Imaginal world is held as the real world and the place where we really exist. "Heaven" and "Hell" would be archetypes in this world. 

It's hugely complex and a whole field of philosophy in it's own right. Mostly from Ibn Arabi but Henry Corbin is the modern scholar most associated with it. 

Some people associate it with Jung's Active Imagination and I think his accounts of Philemon etc would be in line with it.

<TEXT> Also, it seems heightened emotions promote stronger phenomena.

Disagree completely. I think the opposite is true. 

In magical ritual (for example) the aim is to heighten emotion - this is the purpose of the ritual, dire warnings, trappings, demons etc - to the point where one transcends it. 

It is in the 'space' created when desire is transcended that 'paranormal' phenomena or mystical experience happens. The heightened emotion is just a means of exhausting the emotion. If you don't get past that nothing will happen. Ever.

You can verify this quite easily just by pondering it. Nothing ever happens in high-emotion scenarios like football matches, scary movies, religious rallies, TV shows which specialise in drumming up emotion. If your initial contention were true it would be happening all the time every day.

Oth, meditation aims at the same thing: getting past emotion and desire to the place of 'nothing'.

<TEXT> Well according to the god a lot of people worship, it is immoral.

No, according to *their understanding* of what they think their God is it is immoral. 

If morality didn't exist outside of this alleged creation heaven and hell would serve no purpose, since morality wouldn't exist there.

Unless the concept is a mythic one. Or allegorical. 

This is a poor analogy to the human condition and the hypothetical existence of a deity, unless you are admitting there is more than one god.

Now lets say there is only one being, and that being makes a video game, I don't know why the only being in existence would do this but lets just roll with it. The only being alive makes a video game, but the being who is making this video game finds sex and violence to be reprehensible. 

This being then programs the video specifically to not only include the possibility of sex and violence, but programs it in such a way that sex and violence has to occur in order to complete the story the video game tells. The game designer then punishes all the virtual people, who he programed to be violent sexual deviants, after the game ends for doing things the programmer doesn't approve of.

You're assuming that what the video game 'God' appears to want is the same as the 'Programmer God' wants. This may not be so. 

If I program a game with a serial killer in it and I model this serial killer on myself in looks and character.... well, you know where I'm going. 

Now you understand why religion makes no sense to some of us atheists. Humans are allegedly set up to fail from the beginning, then punished for failing, despite being created to fail.

Yeah, I do understand that. And I feel the same. The God that the atheists reject is exactly the same God that I reject. The atheist criticisms of religion I pretty much agree with. 

The difference would be that I don't think that's all there is and it's case closed - I would argue that there's something else beyond those obvious fallacies. The strange thing is that I get the same objections - from a different angle - from fundie religionists as I do from atheists. Both of them have agreed on a definition of what is 'on the table' in the attic and one is arguing that it is there and the other arguing it is not there.... but both are agreeing that the question of whether there's 'something on the table in the attic' is what's at stake. 

I don't think 'what's on the table' is even at issue. I think there's more interesting stuff in the basement.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. In some way. 

I kind of like the model of existence being a 'simulation' that is quite in vogue nowadays. I don't believe it literally obviously but the characters in the simulation clearly would not be able under any circumstances to apprehend the nature of the programmer - let alone 'prove' one existed - unless the programmer had programmed that possibility into the software. 

My take is that God just didn't program that in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While it's possible to point to scientific errors in the Quran, I think the practical problems brought up are much more important. We're talking about core values here - whether religious belief or critical inquiry should be considered as the basis of our values. 

I would dispute some of those claims on the Wiki- there are people with an agenda on both sides and neither are really objective. Generally people need Arabic and a good grasp of Islamic theology to get into it properly though and a lot of people on both sides have neither. Maybe that's for another place.... happy to discuss it elsewhere though!

To claim that science and religion are wholly separate domains is to claim that neither affects our behavior, which is clearly not the case.

That's different though. At least in Islam's case. In Islam there is no priesthood or orthodoxy and no dogma to a certain extent. So it really can't conflict. An example of this would be that there are Muslim theories of evolution way before Darwin. 

The question whether science and religion can be reconciled is beside the point, as that very reconciliation has to be done on one basis or another. The real question is: Which one we look to first, when they at least appear to be in conflict?

Yes, I think that is the question. The answer depends on who you are and how you self-define. There may not be a 'right' answer.

Obviously a fundamentalist would reach for religion first but it isn't either/or. If it was then the Medieval Muslim scientists would not have been what they were as they faced this issue. 

From Wiki:

"From an Islamic standpoint, science, the study of nature, is considered to be linked to the concept of Tawhid (the Oneness of God), as are all other branches of knowledge. In Islam, nature is not seen as a separate entity, but rather as an integral part of Islam's holistic outlook on God, humanity, and the world. The Islamic view of science and nature is continuous with that of religion and God. This link implies a sacred aspect to the pursuit of scientific knowledge by Muslims, as nature itself is viewed in the Qur'an as a compilation of signs pointing to the Divine."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_between_religion_and_science#Islam

If we look to the scientific method, which, on a societal level, is freedom of speech and inquiry, everything can be critiqued, improved upon and cast aside if found lacking. If we look to a religious belief of any kind, that core belief is beyond reproach. The belief can be positive, but it is immutable. Even if we allow for critique (which arguably only lasts for as long as there is no real danger of losing societal control), it is only to prove that very critique wrong. There is no real openness for change, as long as belief trumps logic.

That's not true in Islam, I can't speak for other religions. Or rather it **IS** true now because of literalism and fundamentalism but it's not part of the original religion.

Originally there was the concept of *ijtihad* which essentially a belief that if God created humans as logical and rational then the exercise of logic and reason would lead to God - they could not lead anywhere else. So therefore questioning God was not a problem if one was looking for Truth. 

Obviously things have taken a different turn and that is far from the case these days. 

Now, on the original topic, I think that thoughts like this can be explored by any author regardless of their background, as long as they have the openness to do so. Orwell was born in British India. Nietzsche was studying to become a minister. To diminish a writer to their background (or lack thereof) is not only short-sighted, it just doesn't work.

Yes, I agree. But my point is that these things overlap even if they have different and seemingly opposed labels. Nietzsche is a good example, his view was impinging on the Islamic in many ways and I think he even wrote about this. 

This is especially true with science fiction, where the whole point is to surpass the limitations of everyday ideas.

Yes, that's why this is all relevant - isn't that what religion is too?

The only real point of contention is (imo) *literalist* interpretations as opposed to mythic interpretations. I'd argue that religion, by definition, is mythic and that those who misunderstand this (believers or atheists) completely fail to grasp it. 

A classic example is the people who believe that the 'winged horse' in Muhammad's vision as outlined in the Qur'an is literal. Many Muslims believe this literally (despite it being obviously a vision and stated as such) but also many atheists claim that this is what Islam teaches: literal actual winged horses exist.

This is the problem. If people read religion in a mythic way there would be less problems. I think the article is suggesting Islam is suited to this and that it is a viable way forward - not Islam *per se* but the mythic approach which Islam encapsulates.

<TEXT> Let's break it down into two contentions:

1 I disagree that Islam is fine with science.

2 I don't think I'd get a great response if I went into a mosque in Saudi Arabia and said "God doesn't exist! You're all wasting your time".

These are two different concepts and you have linked them in an unscientific way.

2 is true (though your application is wrong as claiming God does not exist is not science) but it does not relate to 1 unless you can prove that Saudi are representative as a benchmark of what Islam is. Which is not possible because it is not in fact the case and can be demonstrated to be such. 

But getting back to 1. You'd need to prove this and I suppose the way to prove it would be from core texts rather than the behaviour of people who *follow* core texts.

<TEXT> Not really. Allah is the word for 'something that is uncreated'. It is not a name. It is a word that translated into English is taken to mean God (which it does) but which in Arabic can also mean Reality or Truth. It is not a person. 

There is a verse in the Islamic tradition that says "everything that exists passes away except the face of Allah" and conversely implies that whatever does NOT pass away is Allah. 

Really it all boils down to a belief that 'there is something that has no beginning and no end'. There is nothing in science *per se* that would disagree with the possibility of such a thing on principle. 

Another way it's often put is that everything you see or can conceive of (ie everything measurable or observable by science and everything that ever could be) is a 'thing'. 

If you take the position that only 'things' could ever exist it is not a scientific or rational position. 

So if you take a metaphorical list of all these possible 'things' that ever existed AND you admit the possibility that there might be something that could possibly be off the list because it is NOT a thing. Then this is how Islam sees God.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> But I'm guessing what /u/hauty-hatey means is not that a Muslim cannot be a scientist, but that the ideas of faith and reason are based on completely different values.

If he is then I agree 100%. Which is why you can't apply scientific reason to personal conception of God's existence. You CAN critique religious thought, that's different. 

I think this is why the Muslim scientists saw no conflict with faith and science btw too - they realised they were too separate things and kept them apart. 

Today science refuses to keep the two distinct. We need to look at which approach is the best way.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Science and religion (of any type) are not good friends. Science draws conclusions about the world from research and logic, while religion works by assumptions and faith. The agenda of both is irreconcilable.

Which is why I suppose the Scientific Method as we know it was developed by Muslims who in turn were making scientific discoveries we still use today.

The Arab physicist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) used experimentation to obtain the results in his Book of Optics (1021). He combined observations, experiments and rational arguments to support his intromission theory of vision, in which rays of light are emitted from objects rather than from the eyes. He used similar arguments to show that the ancient emission theory of vision supported by Ptolemy and Euclid (in which the eyes emit the rays of light used for seeing), and the ancient intromission theory supported by Aristotle (where objects emit physical particles to the eyes), were both wrong.  Alhazen viewed his scientific studies as a search for truth: "Truth is sought for its own sake. And those who are engaged upon the quest for anything for its own sake are not interested in other things. Finding the truth is difficult, and the road to it is rough. ...

Ibn al-Haytham also employed scientific skepticism and emphasized the role of empiricism. He also explained the role of induction in syllogism, and criticized Aristotle for his lack of contribution to the method of induction, which Ibn al-Haytham regarded as superior to syllogism, and he considered induction to be the basic requirement for true scientific research.

<TEXT> Well yes, obviously. A God with attributes in the sense you outline would fall into that category. 

Islamic tradition has certainly historically lapsed into this on occasion historically but I think it's quite clear in Islamic philosophy that no-one can know God. The nearest one can get - in an Islamic sense - is apprehending the way He manifests in Creation. On the whole Islam never really defines God. It may outline what God 'wants' or, rather, ways to approach 'God' but it never defines what God actually is. He is just God.  

These are slightly different issues though they are interesting. Things like the 72 Houris and the punishment for 'sinning' - I agree, these would not occur in a natural sense. 

This is why they always come from some form of Scripture or other purportedly revealed text/doctrine in religions. One can argue that these Scriptures come from God directly or they do not - but that's slightly different than the 'natural' approach and obviously, where the trouble starts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree. 

Santa presupposes the following:

*An older gentleman wearing red clothes who inhabits a region in the colder climes of earth though is, to all appearances, human, and who employs a regiment of non-human helpers to construct gifts which he delivers during the course of an evening to children on the basis of their behaviour during the year which he records.*

I submit to you that none of the above would occur naturally to anyone contemplating the possible origin of a present they had come into possession of. 

God, on the other hand, has none of those accoutrements - not in the sense I am using it, I am merely using the term as shorthand for 'a Creator'. 

If you mean the *Christian* God specifically or Zeus, or Shiva or A God with defining characteristics then I agree... this would be analogous to Santa but that is not the sense I am employing the term. 

Of course, as you know, Santa is obviously in effect the Christian God (ie a specific being with defined characteristics) once removed. So he is essentially the same thing.

For sure if one was somehow growing up on a desert-island and able to observe flora, fauna and the stars above, I believe the question of where it comes from would occur. Questions of where life comes from and whether it is created or accidental I think are also naturally occurring. "God" would be merely the postulated creator of these existing entities.

<TEXT> I guess I mean that most of us can be seen as normal humanity who are seeking the answers to the questions we generally discuss under the religion/spirituality banner.

Not everyone is interested in this but those that are we can call Seekers. Sometimes Seekers convince themselves they are Finders. Then you have religion. 

They do this self-convincing because they connect with some truth in the system - ie that Jesus or Muhammad or whoever had found the answer. In a way it's a cop-out - to not tread the path yourself but to *believe* instead in someone who did. In fact religion encourages this - the last thing it wants is for a follower to actually BECOME like Jesus or Muhammad. So it makes an artificial divide between us and them - calling them "God" or "Holy" or whatever so as to differentiate them. 

But really we can be what they are. To some degree. "Realised" for me means someone who has reached the full possibilities of evolution open to them.

Yeah it can be. But the legal ruling of what constitutes a Muslim is someone who subscribes to the *shahada* which is affirming "There is no God....... except God. And Muhammad is a Prophet of God". 

As long as you believe that you're a Muslim. It's a pretty mystical formulation too if you think about it. Affirmation and Negation. Also 'God' is held to be undefinable and can be rendered as 'Reality' or other terms. Actually, this 'looseness' is what makes Islam traditionally so rigid in some sense paradoxically - you can have an ISIS under this umbrella as well as a Rumi. But that's a digression from books I guess.

<TEXT> True, I agree. The Islamic Golden Age which produced the scientific discoveries of the day was an amalgam of Muslim, Christian and Jewish thinkers.

But my point is not really about religion per se but rather the degree to which a philosophical conception of God can fit into the sci-fi genre. With Christianity obviously it can't (I don't say this in any partisan way) as to express a Christian theme would necessitate depictions of the Trinity, Jesus, possibly the Vicarious Atonement etc. 

Islam would be more of a blank slate in this respect and there's nothing against (and even quite a lot for) interpretations of God in line with current physics or Quantum theory. You could even shoehorn the Matrix/Simulation models into it and still have no conflict with Islam. 

I think this is what the article meant with its hints at some sort of Universalism. 

As to writing it, I think *any* written Sci-fi could be seen as an Islamic take in essence. Because all Islam really boils down to is: "There is a higher 'something' that we can call God. In essence nothing else really exists". It's a pretty flexible model lol.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure. So write it. Just don't expect others to share this sentiment

Not sure where you got the idea that I did. It's probably been 40 years since such a thing were possible for me and certainly in the last 15 only a moron could really expect more than 1% of any random group to share it. 

Also, science has a tendency to prove some religious views as wrong so if this Muslim perspective means diluting or corrupting the science in the story to fit a Muslim belief, then I would imagine the story would be nothing more than preaching instead of science fiction.

Yeah, Muslims have quite a track-record in science. I guess we know a bit about it having laid the foundation of quite a lot of it. 

But I think you didn't really read my post above - or else I am misunderstanding you here. I hoped I'd quite clearly separated belief/dogma from a wider view but it seems I might not have been as successful as I'd hoped. </TEXT>

Friends of mine talk about GOT all day and play Golf. Both interest me less than watching paint dry... as you say 'who cares?'. 

Well, they do. I don't - I care less about that than you do about this topic you're commenting on - but so what? I don't have to.

Good luck to them. I wouldn't tell them not to post about their interest or talk about it or even ask 'who cares?'.

<TEXT> That is again not taking into account the concept of Scale.

If you create a robot that kills another one in a created mini-environment then do **YOU** have compassion for them?

**Should** you have compassion for them?

You could equally ask does God have compassion for the micro-organism that is one of billions you've killed every day by breathing in. Are you responsible? Is God?

Should you be? 

If you think not then why? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're ignoring the concept of 'scale' which renders the question moot. 

Put it this way: if I make two robots and one of them smashes the other to smithereens then am I responsible? Does it matter? 

If I reside in a massive expanding universe and have, in effect, created a tiny insignificant miniverse with a couple of robots in it - how can this possibly have any impact or significance to the main existent reality? 

So what if robots kick their heads in? They might not like it, it may even matter to them, but to use it as an argument about morality on the scale of the Creator of the robots is ludicrous.

<TEXT> My take - this is from a Muslim viewpoint so ymmv - is that it's seen, at least by Progressive Muslims (probably the only ones reading sci-Fi or even perhaps modern lit lol), as an encompassing paradigm of belief in one over-arching Deity which represents the 'human experience'.

Obviously, by definition, it rules out atheism but it would encompass all other religion and transcend them. In Islam 'Allah' is not a name but is merely the word for God, Reality, or Truth.... Arabic-speaking Jews and Christians use it and atheists discussing God in the abstract as a concept use it.

So the idea would be akin to a sort of 'Star Trek' take where a united humanity of differing races and beliefs set out into the stars with a concept of this 'Something Higher' which they express and search for in the different human ways that we all know. Obviously, as in the Star Trek analogy, when humanity has reached a certain point of transcendence. So it would be 'humans' doing this not 'the US' or 'Russia' or whoever. 

It's obviously a dream (or an ideal if you prefer) but that's why it's Sci-fi I guess. There are numerous books in this genre. I think they may gain traction. It's not religious as such... it's more the world view than any dogma. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also- and this is where atheists go very wrong - religion is not actually a response to natural phenomena (or, as they usually more stupidly have it, 'made up' apropos of nothing) but a response to perceived *numinous* phenomena. 

For example, someone might have a 'mystical' experience and interpret it (rightly or wrongly) as 'God'. Others who don't have that experience believe them and then you have a religion with followers.

Atheists can't admit the existence of numinous phenomena so they aren't in a position to investigate and isolate what it might be if not God. It could well be a natural human experience or even something of evolutionary benefit. 

We probably won't know for a very long time because materialists have defined the terms of the debate - and defined them according to their own lack of perception.

<TEXT> Very, very badly thought out. If at all. 

First we'd need some evidence. Luckily we can argue that point and look at human history. Secondly we need to make a distinction between religion (as a social construct) and awareness/belief in a God or gods.

Let's go back to when we were in our caves, grunting and pulling women around by the hair (I know some of us still are but work with me here). Most likely on current evidence humans at this stage had a conception of 'something higher' but no organized religious or moral framework. That is to say, acceptance of 'God' was not linked to good or bad behaviour.

If your neighbour in the cave next door was a better hunter and had a cuter wife there was nothing to stop you whacking him over the head with a club, stealing his bison and shagging his missus. None of this would be related to your belief in higher powers. 

Religion evolved to stop this sort of behaviour and clearly early societies are *prima facie* evidence of this. Society basically would not be possible if everything was run along lines suggested by a Neolithic Ayn Rand.

So this would seem to militate against the OP's contention: society would not evolve the way it has with its current legal/moral systems if religion were indeed a cover for bad people to do bad things.

Before religion Bad People **WERE** doing bad things. Without let or hindrance. Why would they need to invent a system to enable them to do it when they already were doing it - and moreover 'cloak' this system as a 'good thing' so nobody could tell their dastardly plan. 

Very poor.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about Business Structure of SEO providers. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-02 10:36:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey, I am a longtime web dev and until now have done a certain amount of SEO for clients - not as a package but as a matter of course when I build a site. Basically giving clients fully optimised sites. content provision/copywriting, setting up Google Analytics etc and various other SEO aspects all within the dev project by default.

I'm now moving more to being a freelance consultant  than a strict web dev and have been looking at stand-alone modular services I can provide - SEO being a main one of them.

My question then is not about the mechanics/techniques of SEO but rather whether someone can point to some resource (or give advice) on the structure of the business angle: to charge by the hour, or by the site, to offer packages, price levels maybe... 

What is the way the business is best structured? I have no idea... thanks

Basically it's trying to back up the whole 1tb (it says this in the error and also in the TM preferences) despite the fact only 300g of the 1tb is used **AND** I have disallowed large amounts of music, vids and the Applications folder.

<TITLE> Question re TV series purchase poss error on iTunes </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-18 14:39:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, I bought a couple of episodes of "People vs OJ Simpson" on UK iTunes Store to see if I liked it. 

The whole series was 14.99 GBP and each of the 10 episodes 1.89 GBP, thought if I wanted to buy the series the ones I'd previously bought would be deducted. 

Usually this happens - you buy one episode and get a prompt 'Complete the series for xxx' with xxx being the adjusted price. This does not happen with this series on my ATV where with all other series it does. However many I've bought it always says the original price of the series 14.99. 

So basically I have to buy all 10 episodes individually at 1.89 each now or bite it and buy for 14.99. Either way it's costing way more than 14.99 as I bought 4 episodes thinking the series price would take account of this.

Is it an error? What can be done? Anything? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Splash page to replace current homepage </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-25 11:41:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We've made a splash page that is straight html and is sitting in root as index.html.

We can make this page the default root landing page by giving .html preference over .php in .htaccess and this works fine but the splash page contains a link to the previous homepage at index.php and when this is clicked the link reverts to the splash page because .html is taking preference.

What's the best way to deal with this - i.e:

1) have the splash page sit in root (i.e. not in WP) and replaces the old WP default landing page

2) have a link in this splash page which then links to the old default landing page in WP.

Cheers! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Overplay.Net (looking for an alternative) and Netflix issues </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Been using Overplay.net in Spain for a couple of years since the BBC satellite footprint was reduced - been working fine but now there are huge issues with it on Netflix on Apple TV 2. 

Basically it allows some streaming of certain shows but not others - they get an authorisation error. This is with Overplay DNS set to US. Setting it to UK doesn't seem to work at all. 

That's the first issue. 

Second issue is Overplay seem to be no longer responding to any support requests. Many people have this issue - I've sent at least 20 mails and I know people who've been trying for months. Actually they're still taking people's money, which is fraud right? But that's another story.

So two issue I'd appreciate any help with:

1) Any help with fixing the Netflix/ATV2 issue

2) Suggestions for alternative to Overplay to stream Netflix to ATV2 and also get BBC/ITV players via Airplay on Apple devices. 

Much appreciated, thanks. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Splashpage Index.html and WP Index.php both in root? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-12 21:01:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I need a little help/advice with something. Basically I need to have a Splash page in root - index.html - which links to deeper pages, one of which is index.php (the main Wordpress install) also in root. So essentially having index.html and index.php in root and the WP remaining untouched there but the Splashpage becoming the homepage and linking to the WP start page. Reason for this is to have choice of languages/other custom options.

I have the Splash page there in root and have put this:

DirectoryIndex index.html

in .htaccess which DOES make the Splash page the homepage but when I click on the link on the Splash - www.mysiteexample.com/index.php - it redirects again to the Splashpage. 

Ive installed a plugin Disable Canonical URL Redirection by Mark Jaquith but it seems to have no effect.

Is there anything we can do to get the .html and .php pages in root both working so that splash page loads as default and when links on it are clicked they go on to the main WP first page? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I need to basically duplicate an WP existing site which is currently (say) at www.notrealdomain1.com and have the existing content divided into two duplicate iterations like so:

www.notrealdomain1.com/site1
www.notrealdomain1.com/site2

So we can then edit www.notrealdomain1.com/site2 and change the content - while the original domain - www.notrealdomain1.com - becomes a splash page with links to both the subdomains. 

Can anyone point me in the direction of how best and easiest to do this? Thanks!

Edit: anyone know how to reference urls as above just as pure text without them being turned into active links?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I listed a rare and expensive book on ebay for five days with a BIN and accepting offers. Towards the end of the auction I get someone puts in an offer, one of several I got, and which was the current highest. Feedback seems good, member for years. All ok.

So I wait a little to see if there are any higher offers and in this time he changes his mind and asks to withdraw the offer because he can't afford it and can I reject it. I say that I'll wait a day and if I get another offer I'll take it. If not I'll make a counteroffer and we'll take it from there. He says thanks.

10 minutes later someone buys it. No offer or questions/contact - just a straight away purchase and immediate payment. This person has an account a few months old and only 1 feedback. 

So I go to check and their address is incomplete so I can't ship. I've mailed them for the correct address but no reply yet.

So, my question is: is this suspicious? If so how and what could it be? Or is it Kosher and nothing to worry about? If I don't hear back from them re the address - meaning I can't ship it - what's the best course of action?

I'd also like some input on themes and how they work - do the ones that Squarespace provide always form the basis? Or are there third-party themes? Can you code your own from scratch and drop it in like you can with ExpressionEngine?

<TEXT> I mostly work in ExpressionEngine or other CMS like Craft and code in html5/css3 etc. Basically I need to get a website/portfolio up asap but I'm not up for designing one (design skills zero) and it needs to only be a light minimalist quasi-cv anyway.

My question is re which route to go. I'm considering maybe WordPress with a basic theme or else a hosted solution like About.me with my custom domain.... kind of leaning towards this last one.

Is going with about.me a bad idea in terms of generating leads/enquiries? Are there any similar solutions aimed maybe more at creatives? 

What about Pixpa or Squarespace? A better bet? </TEXT>

<TITLE> UK Occultists: Advice needed on places to live please! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-21 12:42:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Kind of a weird question but I'm living in Spain and the time is coming to move on (I'm originally from the UK but been living abroad 20 years) - I'm getting older and don't really feel up for relocating somewhere I don't know so thinking about (horrifically) moving back.... it's not just me I'm considering the needs of my partner and daughter here. 

So.... if this were to happen, where is a good place from an esoteric pov (please no-one suggest Brighton). I'm seriously considering Glastonbury... I know there's millions of flakes and weirdos there which would be uber-annoying but on the plus-side I could make a business where they are a key target which is good and also the place itself has a vibe I think I might need right now, it's definitely magical despite the depredations of many of the populace.

Anyone have any alternate suggestions? Reasons why Glastonbury is a must or must-not? I can work anywhere pretty much so this is about quality of life and esoteric-sensibility in the environment. I'm also pretty out there myself so would help to be somewhere where I am not the weirdest person in the room at any given place. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Quick Question re Umbraco </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-13 16:01:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, I'm an ExpressionEngine dev and am possibly being tasked with creating a design for the Umbraco CMS which I am not familiar with.

Actually the design is pretty much ready, I just need to slot it in to the CMS - that's how it works with EE anyway as it is essentially a blank slate where content is completely separate from design.

For anyone unfamiliar you basically code up your pages and insert EE tags which are pretty much like Php tags. More to it than that but you get the drift.

Is Umbraco a similar set-up? I know it's not Php but is it going to be doable coding the design in html and just slotting it in this way? I heard it was a steep learning curve. 

How difficult is this going to be or should I try to sway them to another CMS I am familiar with? </TEXT>

Is it any good? What does it use - MySql? Most importantly, how does it handle design - does it separate design from content and can you 'slot it in' as it were like you can with ExpressionEngine or Craft say, or are you stuck with templates?

Any advice appreciated! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Macbook Air - 3 months old. It was shut down ok but now when trying to login the username and password fields remain blank when typing in. After hitting a few keys it acts like one key is stuck (it isn't) and random characters get input into the field until it reaches the field limit. This after touching a key, any key, once. 

The result is that obviously it is impossible to login. I have checked with an external keyboard and the same behaviour is present. Any ideas as to what could be causing this? Not really possible to troubleshoot or fix it if login is impossible.

Meanwhile if interested you can do one of two things - PM me or post here and I'll let you know when I have it or ask for specific titles/authors and I can tell you what I have.

Mostly they new or lightly used pb/hb on the following subjects:

* Modern fiction (Murakami, McEwan, Ishiguro etc)
* Crime fiction
* True crime
* Magick/occult/paranormal
* Religion/theology esp Islamic/Sufism
* Paranormal/conspiracy
* Counterculture/drugs etc

I also have collectable first editions but that's another story and will sell those separately. 

Edit: added Imgur links below to photos of some of the books. There's a lot more than this but if you see anything you're interested in from the photos shoot me a PM or post below.

<TEXT> Has anyone experimented with this? I was first interested in the Burroughs/Gysin Dream Machine - there's a video on YouTube called 'Flicker' for those who haven't heard of it (has Kenneth Anger in it) - but recently acquired a more sophisticated computer-driven device for producing hypnagogic states.

I'm still experimenting but so far it seems to induce states similar to deep meditation with a very defined DMT-like effect. Have not tried any Sigilisation or other workings yet but it occurs to me it could be a powerful methodology. 

Anyone else ever worked on similar lines? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Schrdinger's cat, the Holographic Principle and Public Perception </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-03 05:44:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Schrdinger's cat is the term commonly applied to a model of thought proposed in the 1930s by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrdinger.

Briefly the construct is that we have certain knowledge that within a sealed box is a cat and a vial of poison which, should it break, would kill the cat. From our vantage point - not being able to see inside the box - the common logical position is that the cat is in one of two states - alive (if the vial is intact) or dead (if the cat has somehow broken the vial).

This is the position of the 'normal' and prevailing model pre-Quantum Mechanics but the Copenhagen Interpretation (which Schrdinger was attempting to discuss with his analogy) suggested that the 'cat' (actually he is discussing photons and atoms) did not exist in either state until observed. So in essence, in the sealed box the cat was in a state of limbo, waiting to be assigned its 'reality' when the box was opened and the observers imposed their own view of the situation. This state of limbo - existing in many differing states - is termed *superposition*.

If we note that Einstein himself was more than a little freaked by Quantum Physics - he initially could not bring himself to accept it - we can gain a valuable insight into the processes of mentation of humans from the highest brains on one end of the spectrum to Redditors on the other. 

Adnan's trial was in fact a 'sealed box' and he was the cat. The jury - and judge - with their own prejudices and biases *themselves* defined the state of the cat when they opened the box. And what they had available to themselves to judge was, in essence, the only things they had allowed themselves to see. 

There is a saying in Pakistan (to reference Adnan's cultural background) "to a hungry man, two and two equals four...... loaves of bread". And so it is with the Justice System. It has its own end-goal and, yes of course, it pays lip service to basic maths but the sum of 2 plus 2 is really not that important. What is important is how much '4' can buy. What does it matter if a witness tells a hundred different and conflicting stories? If you can somehow get to 4 - or life +30 - then the sums adds up. 

The problem many people had - still have - with Quantum Mechanics is that they cannot understand how a state of a 'thing' can be undefined. Much less can they grasp that it is an outside observer that does the defining. The implication that 'reality' is malleable sends some people off their rocker.

And so we come to the sorry state of this sub. Adnan's box was opened and the observers saw guilt. In the first trial if it had been opened the - different - observers would have seen innocence. 

This is not a matter for us as we are not the first-hand observers - we are just discussing the process. But there's the problem: those of us who know this truth - that reality itself is a conditioned mechanism - run head on into the fear and reaction of those to whom this very notion is anathema. 

Those who see the gaping holes in the Prosecution case and who wish for another trial for Adnan (putting the cat back in the box in the hope of more enlightened observers) know that, to quote Robert Anton Wilson "Reality is what you can get away with" (i.e. what the *State* can get away with) - while the more voluble of the Guilty crew are very uncomfortable with the idea of a malleable nature of 'truth' (this idea has been called 'Holographic' by thinkers like Michael Talbot for example - it sees various human conceptions, and indeed Reality/Existence as a whole as 'software' being run on consciousness and having no objective existential status).

Many of the Guilty-viewers are those that deny the existence of Superposition - to them the cat is always alive or dead and it is carved in stone. It *cannot* be possible to them that a cat would exist in an intermediate state and that the end state - alive or dead - is one conditioned by them themselves. 

Yes it revolves just the same as Galileo said. And if you think about it, it's quite ironic because the poster-boy of the Guilty Model is someone who's changing stories and 'Holographic' approach to facts is a form of living embodiment of the principles enshrined in the conception of Schrdinger's cat - they accept the decisions of the Police and the Courts *because* they are the decisions of the Police and the Courts but the idea of a malleability of HOW these decisions are arrived at - that there MIGHT not just be room for error but the result might be *constructed*... well... minds get blown. 

The old ways of thought are dying, yes Quantum Mechanics has been a part of it for a long time but the old ways are dying in all stratas of life. The curtain has been peeled back - more and more each day - and increasing numbers of people are seeing through the shadow-show of our systems of banking, justice, economics and looking to a better world. 

We need to MAKE that world by rejecting the old ways of thought and embracing uncertainty. No outmoded models can help us here. It's time to wake up and realise WE condition our own results and we don't need to accept spoon-fed notions of 'justice', 'guilt', 'reality' or anything else. 

If the Emperor is stark staring naked it's totally cool to scream that fact from the rooftops. We don't need to blindly follow the status quo... we can think, we can be free and we can free others who have been imprisoned by old, dying and corrupt systems - free then from prisons literal or metaphorical. 

The cat may be in the box, may be in limbo ready to be assigned a state when we open it, but we should realise that WE can define that state. For good or ill.... I choose good.

<TITLE> Problems with some mind-blowing Claims of Jay </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-30 15:10:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This isn't merely about changing stories - that horse has been well and truly flogged, it's an ex-horse that has gone to join the choir invisible - it's about things that can't actually be possible or don't add up regardless of the relationship to earlier Jay iterations: I'll start off:

It was at least a week before she died, when he found out she was either cheating on him or leaving him.....I think shes fucking around. Im gonna kill that bitch, man. 

So this is a pretty definitive statement we can place in time: Jay claims Hae and Adnan were **still dating** a week before and implies that the reason for the murder was to *stop* her leaving rather than *because* she already had and because he believed her to be cheating. 

There's a difference - and it matters. Because this is the motive. It's not just words - on this is hanging someone's freedom. 

There's more: the "I'm going to kill" note is often cited as a key exhibit that PROVES they had split and that's why Adnan wanted revenge. It also places the split at a time much earlier than Jay's statement above. 

So we've got a problem here: how did Jay get this wrong? 

We were in the car together during last periodhe was ditching the last period. And I said, Hey, I need to run to the mall cause I need to get a gift for Stephanie.

What is happening here is that Jay is shifting the timeline but keeping the framework essentially intact. 

Just as he moves the burial forward from around 6pm to midnight (around 6 hours say) he also moves the car borrowing forward by 4 hours: in Interview 2 Jay says Adnan arrived at his house at 11.am (in other variants 11.45) and THEN they go shopping for presents and Jay takes possession of the car thereafter. 

So this occurrence moves forward to the end of school. Again, things are being shifted upwards in time for some reason.

So I go to pick him up, and when I get there he says, Oh shit, I did it. I say, Did what? He says, I killed Hae.

This may not seem important but it is. In previous variants - "I killed the bitch" - Jay was waiting for the call which he knew would come when it was done. Here he is surprised and not expecting a murder call - he has to ask. 

Also no 'killed the bitch' here. The tone is far more apologetic. "oh shit" rather than "Bitch is dead" gangsta style. 

Btw: he also claims here at the Best Buy he does not recognise, see, or know where Hae's car is or what it looks like. Which is odd because he makes a drawing for the police placing it in a specific position. 

We were friendly, we were cool. I might have sat next to him in a class, and joked or something. *But he didnt call me unless he needed something*

The italicised bit is - imo - a reference to weed and suggestive that Jay was Adnan's dealer. 

Why is this significant? Because in earlier versions Jay has Adnan and him cruising around trying to score: something a bit silly as he's sitting on a stack of weed. this happened in the morning but now Jay has moved the timeline forward to *avoid* or nullify the morning this is not needed as an excuse for what they were both doing so he's free to tell this 'dealer' adjustment. 

It can't actually be because he's scared of the cops in the earlier version as he implies because he's incriminating himself in that regard there also - and it's a moot point because he's reached a deal or else he wouldn't be saying anything at all.

I knew him because I knew Muslims in the community from playing basketball at the mosque.

This should be verifiable no? Is it really possible that all of Adnan's buddies and the mosque crew failed to notice this? It's interesting if it's a false claim as it's an insane one to make if not true, but even more interesting if true because it opens up more questions I think. 

Yes. When we were digging the hole, its not like Haes body was just lying next to us. She was still in the trunk.

Seriously? Why would he say this if the earlier story of her being by the hole is true? Why change it? 

Alternatively, if it's true, why lie before? To the cops? What could be gained either way?

Either he is a pathological liar who has been inserting himself into the investigation - as often happens - and the cops believed him/went with it for their own ends or he has a specific reason to change these details. 

I am leaning towards the latter: anyone with any sense would not give an interview now and to this website and would not do it alone and unadvised as he is apparently doing. 

I think there's maybe something he wants to get out there and change/underline. I guess we'll learn more in the upcoming episodes but it could well be that Jay is a fantasist who saw a chance to embroider a whole tale with himself in the spotlight of it and struck gold by being in possession of certain facts. 

It may well be that Jay and his stories have very little at all to do with Adnan's guilt or otherwise in the way he is spinning them.

<TEXT> I don't mean the RealCat, Mr X or the Westside Hitman (but those are certainly possibilities) but it seems likely to me that someone - let's say a legal/PR advisor rather than 'the third suspect' - put Jay up to the interview.

It's unlikely he is trying to monetise things as I understand that being an accessory he can't profit from any of this (money would have to go to Hae's family - btw, is this true? And if so then why not charge a huge fee and do that if he cares so much?) so money is not a factor. 

It's also unlikely that a murderer would expose himself in this way but Jay is not your normal guy in the street so who knows?

Do you think there is someone working Jay with their foot as it were? A hidden-hand or advisor? One thing re Jay's stories: they do prove he is not the most astute at dealing with his own PR. 

Who is behind this? Jay or an advisor? And what's the end-game?

<TITLE> What we need to believe for Adnan to be guilty </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-22 13:28:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There's many posts along the lines of 'what we must believe if Adnan is innocent' which usually boil down to the one or two points in the State's case that are not 100% dismissible.

I thought maybe we should come at it from the other side: what we need to believe to find him guilty. 

To believe Adana is guilty and to accept the State's argument - as many do here - one must also believe, if even by implication, that Adnan is not only a moron but perhaps one of the MOST moronic and stupid idiots ever to have tried to murder another human being. 

Assuming him guilty for argument's sake, here's a list of his stupidities:

* He plans a murder and does not set up any alibi

* He ropes in an accomplice. Not always totally stupid (well, yes) but to choose one not related by religion or family or some other tie which might ensure loyalty is verging on the insane. And not in a 'psychopath' way. No, he doesn't do that, instead he gets some local lame stoner that is 'the criminal element' of the locality. Someone known to the police and devoid of any trust.

* He then proceeds to ask this guy if he can help bury a body - thus putting his life in his hands. Literally.

* He goes on to compound this stupidity by lending this guy his OWN car and his OWN phone. 

* Then - in the presence of witnesses - he tells a lie that his car is in the shop. The same car that will come to the same location to pick him up after track - and asks for a lift from the victim. Let's say that one again: he attempts to lure the victim into the killing zone by approaching her in public in front of witnesses with a provable lie.

* He kills her in a public space leaving himself the problem of being seen in the act or getting her in the trunk. If he is guilty he apparently got away with that but it's still a very, very stupid gamble to take. And he would have got mega lucky here.

* He calls a girl he wants to get with for a chat. As you do when you've just strangled someone. 

* Doesn't have a plan for body disposal and instead drives around scoring, smoking dope, hanging out with friends and generally acting sketchy while the body is in the trunk and apparently forming no visible plan for disposal of the body which does not seem to be a pressing matter. 

* Knowing the police will call him and grill him about his knowledge of the disappearance he decides to get higher than he has ever been in his life.

* While in this high state - so high he wants to come down - the Police call. He answers it and engages them instead of ignoring the call until he was more together.

* Eventually he gets round to deciding to bury the body. Obviously, not having planned any of this despite it all being premeditated he doesn't have shovels so he despatches the accomplice to go and get some - again trusting that he won't drive directly to the cops or otherwise disappear and leave him holding the body unable to dispose of it. For a burial site he chooses somewhere pretty obvious, near to a road and only bothers to dig 6 inches leaving a shallow grave to be disturbed by predators. 

* He goes home to chill and makes sure when her disappearance is known to do two things: call the cops asking about it and never phoning her so as to rouse maximum suspicion when the cops ask why this is. 

* He makes sure to write "I'm going to kill" on a note of the murdered girl and/or ensures it is in full view and prominently displayed for the cops to find.

* He then waits around to be arrested instead of disappearing himself. 

* He refuses to offer any cogent explanation for any of the above and instead of thinking of any rational explanation in the 15 years he's had to think about it he still claims not to remember.

* He continues over 15 years to protest his innocence and thus ensure he will never be granted parole and will die in prison having spent almost his entire life there if he were to live to normal age expectations. 

If the above is true, is it possible that there is any stupider criminal currently incarcerated in the entire US?

<TEXT> Which is really horrible if you think about it because:

* it will validate his efforts, ineffectual though they are
* we won't hear the end of it - well, actually we will because no-one listens to his podcast but you know what I mean
* it may well empower him to keep going - at the very least he WILL smoke a few bowls in celebration and from then on all bets are off... anything could happen... he's probably going to sing.

That last one is the one I'm really worried about. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a Netgear router (CG3100) which is in my office and the base of our wireless network. A few rooms to the back of the apartment we have an Apple TV but the wireless connection here is flaky and keeps dropping out so I want to extend it. 

I found an old AE base station (A1088) which is good and working - I understand though that this can't extend the Netgear wirelessly as you need all Apple products for that, but it can extend the network when connected by Ethernet. 

Been searching for how to do this but can't find any info.. can anyone point me in the direction of some resources/how-to for this or let me know how to do it?

Cheers!

<TITLE> Question for "Adnan is Guilty" Redditors </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-10 21:45:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What's your best explanation for why after 15 years Adnan maintains his innocence when it will almost certainly result in him dying behind bars?

Assuming he is guilty he could - at any time in the last 15 years or in the future - admit to the crime (just like many in the guilty camp were quick to jump on when it came out that he wanted a plea-bargain and saw it as evidence of guilt), do a few more years time, show remorse and be out at some point before he dies.

He could theoretically be out now if he had done this. Oth, no parole board will even look at his case sympathetically while they interpret his insistence on innocence as 'showing no remorse'.

So... disregarding his stance at the trial which is a one-off roll of the dice, now he is seen as guilty anyway what's the best explanation of why he - in practice - opts to die behind bars rather than at least have some of his life outside of prison?

Anyone advancing an argument that employs the word 'psychopath' will be berated and/or ignored depending on amusement factor.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-12-05 10:15:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I was in Uni in Scotland I once went into a bar where there were two guys shouting at each other and generally ratcheting up the aggro. 

I soon realised that one of them was a Rangers supporter and one a Celtic. For any non-Brits this is football (real football) and these two hate each other. One is Protestant, one is Catholic. One is pro-Palestine, one is pro-Israel. One supports Irish Independence, one is pro-British etc. Maybe they just hate each other above all that. Anyway, it's mucho problemo whenever they meet and this sort of situation is typical... it plays out via the football and the teams. 

So these guys are arguing about the teams and the players and God knows what: Celtic vs Rangers (I'm Celtic all the way btw in case anyone wants to take it outside) and it's getting a bit tasty so I start trying to calm them down. 

I know a bit about football so I manage to do it ok but they keep butting in and soon it looks like it's all going to kick off. I have to do something so I say "look guys, no need for violence, let's just chill and have a laugh, it's only a game, there's so many more important things...."

That's when they both tried to kick MY head in. I had to run for my life. I remember them both shouting in the distance "YOU THINK IT'S ONLY A GAME??? YOU BASTARD!!!"

<TEXT> In Europe we have a law of 'Right to be Forgotten' which essentially was brought in to protect celebrities/politicians from having bad things they've done floating round the internet.

With some Google searches relating to Serial I get the notice that some eta has been removed and a link to [Google's Policy](https://www.google.es/policies/faq/) on this. 

This law requires an individual to request that data relating to themselves be removed from Google searches. When it is successful then you will get the notice saying it's been done but not the details of who (obviously).

So - it seems that someone is requesting pages relating to themselves in relation to Serial/Adnan's case on Google be removed in Europe.

Is there a similar law in the US? Would these pages be visible in the US for a similar search?

<TITLE> Yet another Hitman theory - how about this... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-29 14:23:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Adnan was up for killing Hae but isn't capable of it himself.

In his "I'm going to kill" rants to Jay - which are only half-serious - Jay mentions he could get it sorted as he knows someone who could handle this type of work... agrees to act as a middle-man for a fee (possibly related to the $100 'loan'). 

Hitman does his thing after Jay and Adnan set it up. Then Jay and Adnan cruise around randomly doing stuff and visiting people intending to be each other's alibi.

Perhaps Jay facilitates this guy in some way in keeping with his story or maybe not. 

Afterwards the hitman sees they are amateurs and tries to leverage them some mor with a shake-down.... or Jay does to Adnan on his own initiative. 

Adnan doesn't bite and Jay follows through and tells his stories to the police after cutting a deal to stay out of the picture. Of course he leaves the truth about the hitman out of it and thus his story is confused and muddled as it is essentially a lie - but also the truth. 

Adnan can't take Jay down without taking the hitman down so he has to base his appeals and possible release on something that is true - he did not kill Hae - but is also not true as he was the cause of it. 

The hitman is still out there, or even perhaps 'in there' and able to get to Adnan somehow. 

He's preferring his life +30 to a death sentence essentially.

<TEXT> There's a lot and I might list them here as I'm reading through but this one needs explaining before all that. 

**From Page 29**

*Ritz: The other conversation you said you had with him and what was that again?*

*Jay: He wanted me to revisit the body*

*Ritz: And when did that conversation take place?*

*Jay: Um prior to Hae Lee's death (!!!! WHAT?)*

*Ritz: How did that all come about?*



Ritz just carries on!! No questions, no pulling up, no elucidation!

You've got to think Jay could not have said this and that if he did Ritz would be like 'whoa...wait...'.

This kind of stinks. Seems some sort of creative editing of which this is an uncaught mistake is the most logical explanation I can think of...

<TITLE> Most Insane Serial Theory of the Week Award </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-25 10:57:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We need one. I am going to petition Reddit. 

There's going to be stiff competition and I don't envy the judges - I like to think my (ignored) Rogue Pyschopathic Cop theory would be in the running but that's last week and doesn't qualify.

So, inspired by the theories I've been reading over my morning coffee - and which shall remain nameless - here's my official entry:

*Adnan is covering for someone else. Someone he cares about enough to take the rap. He enlisted Jay to help him incriminate himself and told him the details of the car, location, other stuff. Then he wrote "I will kill" on the letter and left it for the cops to find.*

*He also planted other 'clues' like the Neighbour Boy story and the Nisha call. This is also why he 'doesn't remember' and seems to have no enthusiasm to exonerate himself.*

Now.... where can I pick up my award? I want to think my agent, my parents, God..and of course SK.... thank you, thank you... words can't express how much this means... (sob)

They constantly say things like "if he was guilty - which of course he is - then blah" and "If you find Adnan likeable - and I like him less and less - blah"

But they dress all this up as *journalism* and accuse SK of not having journalistic integrity. It's just an Adnan bash-fest...give us the **Evidence** to support your argument!!!!

<TITLE> Nisha Call theory </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-16 13:19:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> How about this: 

Jay has had a thing for Hae for a while. He cosies up to Adnan to get close to her.  He's jealous of Adnan and resents Hae has only eyes for him.

When they split he decides to make his move. But he's too late, Hae is seeing someone else. He becomes obsessed, ignoring his girlfriend on her birthday he decides to meet up with her to lay it on the line. She's not interested, he's annoyed - it ends how it ends.

He panics but thinks quick - he knows Adnan will come under the police microscope as prime suspect so he decides to divert the spotlight to him: he phones the one person in the phone only Adnan knows - or rather he calls the one number he doesn't recognise knowing that later this number will be checked and whoever is at the other end will truthfully swear they do not know Jay but are friends with Adnan. 

On the call he bluffs a wrong number "Is that Carolina Hegelby?" - "no, this is Nisha" or whatever... "oh, sorry wrong number". He gets Nisha's name this way but this is not totally necessary for this theory. Maybe he doesn't and just leaves it at 'wrong number'. The point is he talks and the call is registered.

Later he's got the job at the video store and Adnan is there hanging out. Jay asks him about girls he's seeing and banters in the way guys do about this stuff. Adnan tells him about this hot chick Nisha and Jay knows this is the girl in the phone.

In the ongoing banter Jay gets Adnan to call her and put him on the line (btw, this getting Jay to speak to Nisha has never been satisfactorily explained) maybe by saying he didn't believe him she existed or maybe turning the conversation to how sexy her voice is and getting Adnan to let him hear it...whatever. Doesn't matter. Point is that Jay at this point is essentially **replacing** the earlier call with this CURRENT one which *proves* they are together - thus validating Jay's story.

If it was not for the fact that Adnan had told Nisha they were in the video store and that it could be proved he only worked there *after* the murder then everyone - cops, Nisha, everyone - would have seen the Nisha Call as iron-clad evidence they were together at the murder time.

I don't know which phone called Nisha from the video store but I'm guessing it wasn't the same cell as the original Nisha Call.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've never been 100% happy with the car as the murder-scene myself. We have no evidence for it - it seems the police have no evidence for it either - and the numerous alleged places that the car was located when it happened plays into this too.

Why are we sold on it? Just because Jay says so?

It seems to me that the burial-place was also a kind of place where people might meet to hang-out, drink/toke whatever. Certainly they did at least one time as the evidence there of the alcohol   condom shows. This is either indicative of an ongoing meet-place or else the killers maybe met there for purposes other than just burying the body.

We have no data on HOW the decision for this method of disposal was decided on do we? A discussion of how to do it? At some point the killer must have decided to use this method above others they had considered.

Is it possible the killer decided on this method because they were already there at that spot with Hae when things got dark and Hae got murdered? Perhaps the killer and her had gone there for sex? Or he had lured her there for intended sex on a pretext she fell for unaware of his intent? The rope might be significant here as an intention if we're looking at premeditation. 

The killer gets her there. Tries it on. She resists. It gets ugly. She dies. The killer hides her there and buries her in the same place after going to get the tools to do it. 

Works as well as in the car-park to me. Especially as it circumvents the cameras/witness possibility/get her in the trunk issues as well as the fact that at least two of the places claimed for this to happen must be false.

If you're going to lay a false trail why not lay that false trail three lout three false instead of two: i.e. she was not killed in the car at all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is anyone else curious about this statement of Adnan's? On face value it is about the police - and most likely it is - but does it have to be?

Even if it does refer to the police (which it probably does) then there are two key aspects to it:

* Who is he saying it to?
* Why is he panicked now? 

This second one seems divergent with Jay's testimony of a totally cool/cold killer boasting and proud of what he's done - sure of himself. In fact, as some here have argued, if he is guilty then it almost is a given that he's borderline sociopathic and while Jay's testimony supports this view then this reaction certainly doesn't. 

Put it this way: if you've just murdered your gf and you're happy cruising round, scoring weed and hanging out getting so high you feel like you need to come down...if after all that on the day of a murder during this monster high you **Still** are confident enough to take a call from the cops and engage them instead of skipping the call.... 

I'm thinking a visit from the cops on another day when you're straight and had got all your crap together might not be so panic inducing.

<TITLE> Staring to feel there's a Hidden Elephant in the room.. </TITLE>

<TEXT> The detective in Ep8 mentions that in any case there are many inconsistencies that somehow get bypassed - either as Bad Evidence or because that's just what happens in investigations... some things never get wrapped up and in the search for a conviction (as opposed to The Truth) then that's accepted.

Many of the things we puzzle over here will probably end up in that category but there's one that I don't think will and which, imo, is the central core both of the case and the podcast: Adnan's attitude.

He seems to have no passion for his own situation and to 'make it right' or outrage at Jay etc. No sense of injustice. All this is fine if he's guilty but he 's still claiming he's not - but not appearing to act like we would expect someone to do in that situation.  Note: obviously we don't know him or how he reacts so this is not science, nor does it mean he's guilty (or innocent) but what it does mean I think is that there is something else in play... something we don't know about. 

And we don't know about it because it's a bombshell (probably) that SK has found out and that was pencilled in to be the Big Reveal that will tip us to innocence/guilt at the end of the series.

I hope this doesn't happen personally and it is not like this but from my pov it's looking more like it. 

The reason - apart from the moral/manipulative one often discussed here - is that if that were to be the way it goes then it would go right against the spirit of why we all bought into Serial in the first place.

We're all - to some exert - playing the amateur sleuth here and that's a large part of the appeal: making discoveries, doing research to whatever extent or just thinking things over. 

If it looked like we'd been fed info or led along certain paths when the 'real' info was not on the table I don't know how I'd feel. Put another way, as long as we're n the journey together with SK week by week I'm cool with her knowing stuff we don't know (has to be that way) but if there's a big fat elephant sitting there in camouflage from Day One and we've been misdirected from it so it can be unveiled in Ep11-12 say then I don't know how I'd feel.

It would kind of go against the ethos of the show maybe.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm thinking of making a Meet-Up group though don't know if there'd be any interest. Definitely wouldn't be woo-woo/new-age or any of this Reality Ghosthunters crap. But not sceptical in the debunking sense either.... I'd like to research some Barcelona folklore/paranormal stuff too. 

Would best be like an old-school Fortean moot in a pub but not sure if there's any interest in this here. Anyone else interested in this stuff? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Nisha Call - landline or cell? </TITLE>

<TEXT> It's my understanding that the Nisha Call that is SK's 'smoking gun' was a call to her landline. This is the line on which she testified to not having a voicemail/answering machine. 

Adnan when questioned by SK said he was sure she had a voicemail. So the question is: did Nisha have a cellphone too? If so then it would for sure have had a voicemail (isn't it a default?) and could explain Adnan's claim. 

More importantly, it might reveal there were more calls if we knew both numbers. It seems they spoke a lot. </TEXT>
