Maybe run away and start a life somewhere else completely detached from them with no way to communicate. Even if it means being homeless and hungry for a bit.

<TEXT> Fuck depakote. I gained 100lbs in a year and ruined my body for years afterward because of it. It spiked my appetite, I started eating 4k+ calories daily, and had less energy for exercise. I gained weight and it sent me into a depression that was relieved by eating sugar or junk food. My body built a dependency on it and addiction to sugar and I feel so horrible without sugar and carbs that I can't even function. How am I supposed to lose weight like that?? I went from 230lbs with a size 48" chest, 17" biceps, 34" waist to 335lbs, 54" chest (of fat) 18" biceps and 48" waist. My self esteem is shot to shit and nobody cares to be around me anymore. I used to walk into a room and turn heads of most of the women there. Now I gross them out and people avoid me. So fuck depakote. I suggest finding something that won't ruin your life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It worked. I'm sure there were far less random killings back when hanging people for their crime was routine. If it's blatantly obvious, speedy trial and hanging. This cozy jail system they get to live in forever isn't punishment. He doesn't deserve to live at all. And he can be an example nobody would forget instead of just disappearing and nobody fully understanding or knowing if he is actually suffering and paying the consequences. This generation is too lenient and "open minded" about shit and everyone should be "free and fair and treated with respect and love" and that's why people are dying at the hands of really fucked up people. Because they know they can get away with it. </TEXT>

Anxious like I was waiting for the next thing to happen. Emotional about things I'm not typically emotional about. Lost interest in a lot of hobbies and slept more often. Medication has saved my life, but it does sound like you have type two. Not sure what else it could be. Take their diagnosis, try their treatment, and see if your life improves. It can't hurt to try. If nothing ever changes, then seek other opinions. The first and hardest step to this is to trust your doctor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sounds like he may be bipolar himself if you aren't doing anything to trigger his outrage. An unhealthy environment will make anyone go a little crazy and be more aggressive and defensive and sensitive than usual. I was the same way living with my parents. When I moved out away from their negativity I felt so much better, but I actually am bipolar. The meds are just chilling you out, they would do that to anyone. They don't only work with bipolar people. You need out, and safety, and therapy to help you realize it isn't your fault and it's okay to be alone to recover. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good, then your country will prosper and people should be immigrating there to improve it further. I'd prefer the US be taken over by a more respected authority and run much differently.

<TEXT> I don't think America is even close to the greatest in the world. Number one in debt, the politics here are a mockery and a joke with zero respect left for any kind of leadership, taxes on literally everything, high health costs and ridiculous insurance premiums, racist police hunting the black community, government resistance to greener energy, along with, as you said, immoral immigration practices based on religion. How exactly does that make me dense? I'm saying dont come here, I want out, and people need to know coming here isn't going to solve anything except the violence issue, which other better countries offer as well. </TEXT>

Or get beside her and have her look out at something and get that angle.

I was pretty successful too for a while until it took over and did so much damage mentally that I couldn't face anyone and my anxiety was through the roof at just the thought of seeing someone else. I wish there was job security or protection for when things like this happen, but people don't understand this isn't a choice, and they arent willing to wait it out. Depression sucks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's embarrassing. If I can smell it, they can smell it, and I don't want people thinking I just jizzed my pants 5 minutes ago. I cover myself in antiperspirant deodorant and body spray and do my best to avoid situations that make me sweat, but it's not always easy. I'd rather deal with this than depression tho. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I cant tell if half these comments are genuine opinions or people just making a sarcastic mockery of everything. Also the media lies and twists truths all the time just to keep ratings up. I don't understand why people even watch the news. It's biased depending on what channel you watch and they report things without providing proof or facts and they speculate, causing people to take speculation as a reliable fact source. People should support the new President because they can't change the fact he was elected instead of constantly trying to find ways to slander him. Spend that energy looking for ways to help him be the president we need rather than blame him for shit in the past. Not saying I'm a fan of Trump, but we're stuck with him. Make the best of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am. Fuck everyone. Nobody gives a shit about us unless it makes them look good or feel like a better person. Mobile phone stores are out to screw everyone anyway so they probably deserved it. High stress situations will trigger my rage and the reaction releases endorphins that make me feel better but make those around me fearful. The problem is we will never get anywhere in life by giving into these feelings. We have to suppress them and be who they want us to be to succeed. It's a shitty hand we've been dealt, but fighting the current will only wear you down and you'll keep ending up back at the bottom. When you get on medication you'll be able to deal with all the bullshit. Best wishes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My sex drive has been in overdrive for years (I'm 28) I love anything sexual. It's a release and for a brief moment I don't feel horrible, and I'm incredibly attracted to the female body. Even if there's no romantic interest, just playing with or seeing a female body drives me absolutely wild. I've only ever been with a few girls, and none have been able to keep up with my drive, so it makes for a frustrating life. But what else is new.

After being on antidepressants I'm feeling fairly stable. Just trying to get a consistent sleep schedule going. Seems like I can only sleep 4-5 hours at a time and at weird times. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have bipolar disorder, and when I was first diagnosed and put on medication, I was feeling like it wasn't working to relieve my anxiety and aggression. So I decided to double my dose. Bad idea. I went into a mindless rage, screaming at my parents and breaking things. I'm 6'2" and 230lbs. My dad is 5'9" and 190lbs. He was nervous and knew he needed help to control me  so he called 911. That only made things worse for me, how dare my own father call 911 on me. I started screaming at him again and he started walking toward his bedroom. I know he keeps a gun under his bed, and I thought that was what he was going for, so I screamed "HES GOT A GUN" so the 911 operator could hear me. Within a minute I could hear sirens outside. This was my GTFO moment. 


It was dark outside, and I ran. I ran faster than I thought was possible for someone my size. I came across a neighborhood sign down the street that was front lit, about a 4' high brick sign, and I hid behind it. Seconds later 3 police cars with lights on and spotlights out lining up the woods around me came slowly rolling by. They never saw me. I was able to evade the police until we all calmed down and I was able to explain why that happened. Never again will I double a dose, and I flushed that particular medication and got something else immediately. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't felt joy or happiness in a long time, but today I did a photo shoot with my son using only my phone (Galaxy s7) and a white sheet with some LED bulb lights I made using supplies from Walmart, and I felt great! I had a great time doing it, and they came out amazing! Just thought I'd share that if you can find something you enjoy during a depression, something you've never done before, you may get a break from feeling so down.


Here are a couple of the pics.

I do a hell of a job while I'm okay, and they're willing to work with me to get healthy again when I'm depressed. I've been given a month off in my current state until I can get on medication and feel better. Look for a job that is flexible and talk with the hiring manager about your condition so they don't put you in a critical position and can work with you when you have any problems. It'll remove a lot of stress from your life.  </TEXT>

Then I lose my shit and all the expenses fall on her and stress her out when I can't work, which makes me feel even worse. So it's an evil endless cycle and she does everything she can to keep our life from falling apart and losing everything we worked so hard for. It sucks. Really hoping meds will help me soon.

<TITLE> I bought things in my depression just trying to feel something... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-27 06:39:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been spending money like I have a week left to live. I'm desperately trying to fill the void in my life with things I thought would help me feel better, or at least get a quick break from the constant depression and feel a hint of joy. Unfortunately most of the things I've purchased and always wanted haven't made a difference, other than emptying my bank account. So a warning to everyone: not just manic phase cause spending. Watch your depressions too. Buying things won't help you feel better.


On that note, I got a new 55" led smart TV, [Adopted a super sweet dog] (http://imgur.com/DwYZF8e) that I will be registering as an emotional support dog (she actually has helped out SO MUCH and gives me a reason to get up and get out) and a drone that I'm trying to learn how to fly, if I don't break it from frustration because I keep crashing it 5 seconds into flight, and GTA V for my Xbox One. The only thing that has helped is my dog. She's amazing. I recommend it if your situation allows it to adopt a sweet dog who will love you unconditionally and doesn't care if you have a bad day. 

Thanks for reading. Hopefully I'll be through this soon because I don't know how much more I can take.

On a similar note, those people who leave their shopping carts in parking spaces instead of in a cart return. You just walked around an entire store with that cart, and out to your car. What's another 30 feet max to put it where it goes so it doesn't roll away and hit someones car?! I hate lazy people.  </TEXT>

I get so depressed I deactivate my Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and block my "friends" from contacting me. Nobody wants to make any effort to hang out or talk to me, even after I've reached out, so they can go to hell for all I care. I need friendship and support and have literally none. Plenty of acquaintances and people who pretend to like me as long as they get something out of it. It's just another cause of my stress anxiety and depression. The lack of genuine friendship in a time of need just makes me question myself even more. Does anyone else do this? Does it help? </TEXT>

Nobody wants to make any effort to hang out or talk to me, even after I've reached out, so they can go to hell for all I care. I need friendship and support and have literally none. Plenty of acquaintances and people who pretend to like me as long as they get something out of it. It's just another cause of my stress anxiety and depression. The lack of genuine friendship in a time of need just makes me question myself even more. Does anyone else do this? Does it help? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was off meds and doing okay for the last 3 years. A couple months ago I felt manic, then an inevitable spiral downward ever since. I have hit an all time low, and it has ruined my career, I'm now unemployed, it has ruined my credit, and is ruining my relationships with family. My parents and spouse all want to fix me and hold me responsible for literally everything and I can't do anything anymore. Im overwhelmed and devastated that I'm no longer the functioning person I used to be. I'm losing everything and can't stop it on my own. I can't see a doctor until the second week of December to get treatment and it has been hell and will only get worse until then. I have no money and no insurance to be seen sooner, my bills and debt are piling up so fast (went from $3k/month to $0) and it's only making everything worse. I wish I could put life on hold but life doesn't wait. If you trip, you drown. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was diagnosed by a psychologist, who then recommended me to a psychiatrist as a psychologist cannot prescribe medications. The psychiatrist agreed immediately with my diagnosis and so have a few others since then. Don't mention medication or any specific drug. They'll gladly put you on depakote or lithium if you're truly bipolar. Mood altering drugs like Xanax or Ritalin or Adderall probably won't be prescribed until you've exhausted the others and they see no improvement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I smoked recently for the first time being in an extremely depressed and desperate state. My anxiety and depression were so strong and I have no meds or insurance. When I smoked, I got a much needed break from the anxiety and my mood stabilized for the night. I played grand theft auto and laughed out loud for the first time in a month. It helped tremendously as a band aid. I cant smoke 24/7 though, and when the high wears off I'm right back to where I started. No noticeable negative effects for me coming down, but everyone is different. I recommend trying it if you need relief immediately. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as manic episodes go, it's great when you have a good day or week. it becomes annoying when it's ridiculously over the top and energized and you're extremely chipper in situations that call for calm or a more subdued attitude. It's hard to take someone seriously when it seems their positivity and energy seems fake and doesn't fit the situation. Aim for stability, where you are in control of your emotions instead of them controlling you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Drinking is a downer. It's going to make you feel worse if you have too much so be careful with that. And as far as telling people, I've told almost everyone I know who is close to me that I am bipolar. I've lost some friendships because they can't handle my personality, and I haven't attempted to fix those relationships for their own sake. It sucks because I liked them, but they get offended or hurt or weirded out if I'm not feeling my best. So if they can't be supportive and understanding, then we don't need to have any relationship at all. You don't need anyone who stresses you out, disappoints you, causes you to feel inferior or like something is wrong with you.. we don't need people telling us we are inadequate because we aren't normal. We do that to ourselves enough. Put some distance between you and whatever and whoever could be stressing you out or causing depression. It's okay to be selfish once in a while and do literally whatever you want to feel better. Medication and professional help is your safest option. I would take advantage of anyone willing to help you out because you're worth it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm experiencing it now. No medication, no therapy. Just extreme depression and ridiculous anxiety and it's affecting my job, my relationship with family and friends, and my appetite. I've never had it this bad in the past. I find it hard to sleep, I am in a constant state of worry. Your manic episode lasting that long may have not been mania at all but genuine stability and happiness. Have you been diagnosed? If so, what type? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like your post because I remember being there. Self medicating, using anything to alter my mood if I felt anything other than incredible. I stopped those. I did okay without medication for 3 years. It never goes away, and comes back with a vengeance when the depression does return. I am fighting for my sanity right now actually. I was a high functioning highly intelligent proactive person when I was feeling good. I'm the total opposite now and know I need help to get out of it. But it has to be done the right way and stability is better than swinging from low to unnatural high and back. All we want is stability, normality, and happiness. We don't know what is normal because we aren't. Rely on those who are to tell you when you seem normal. It's the only way we can succeed in this society and be somewhat happy. I remember being in a manic phase how amazing it felt. It's a shame not everyone can experience that forever, if at all. People like me and they don't as well. They like me, but something keeps them at a distance and I am still very lonely. They are entertained by my personality but on a deeper level once they get to know me I become too much to handle. Maybe that's what your friend is going through. Idk. I'm just passing time trying to forget my own complicated misery by trying to figure out yours lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was emotionally abusive when I didn't know I was bipolar. I did and said things to my now ex wife that I don't remember, but when she told me I felt horrible. Never once did I physically hurt her, but that doesn't mean the feeling didn't arise. In a rage I broke things, punched things, threw my wedding ring out the window on the freeway in front of her because of how angry I was, and I don't even remember why. But I never once hurt her. It is a choice. You have to know you will lose everything and hurt so much more if you physically abuse those you love. I lost my wife because of this illness, and hurt for years after the divorce, and not once did I blame her for it. She didn't deserve any of it. The thing I have found that helps me now in angry rages is to separate myself immediately from those I love. They have been forewarned that if I disappear suddenly  to not take it personally and my sudden departure is much better than the alternative. Don't be afraid or too prideful to walk away. </TEXT>
