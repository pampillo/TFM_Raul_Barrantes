<TEXT> Like my title said It crashes when entering a multiplayer game. The game tells me to update my driver, but I have already updated my driver with the AMD Autodetect program. I have an AMD Radeon 7800 card. 

Any help would be great, cause I just dropped big bucks on this game. And as a student this kinda hurts my pocket... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Too wide? Must be hard for you to find clothes that fit, if you are that slim.
But when I am looking at it now, this coat could easily be tapered.

Edit: May I ask in what country did you see the coat I have only seen it on vacation Spain, and I would like it in another colour if that is possible.

<TEXT> I dont understand all the hate against chiropractors. I used to ride dirt bike/MX, and I had a huge crash once. My back got fucked, my spine was all fucked up and my shoulder kept on falling out of its position.
I went to a chiropractor, and he helped me ALOT. What is all this talk about them being bullshit? Cause I can right now look in the mirror and see that my back is good again.

I also went to a physical therapist, and he said I should keep going to the chiropractor. 
(The physical therapist was fixing my shoulder, and the chiropractor was fixing my back). </TEXT>

So what I am asking about is; Do anyone of you have a solution for this, cause I should be able to run it.
Will post DxDiag if asked.

And I think that is one of the best things the school has given me, cause I can talk to people from all over the world because of that.
Thirteen years is too much, but atleast ten years is good. But when we start to get spanish, german or french on the side of that. Well that just makes it hard for us :)
