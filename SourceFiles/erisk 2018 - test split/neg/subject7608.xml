<TITLE> I'm celebrating my birthday alone. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I was in 1st grade, I had a birthday party for my entire class to come to. Nobody came. I was alone for my birthday then. At a skating rink we rented out. My mom and dad were there and held me when I was crying. It was my worst birthday ever. 

I'm turning 21 Thursday. I've been so excited about it for months, because I finally get to do things with my friends like go to casinos and drink downtown on the weekends. 
Well, everything has fallen apart this week. My best friend is moving in with another friend so they're both busy. Another one is out of town for work. Another one is stuck at work until 10 pm that night. 
I have work the next day so I can't wait for them to get off work and celebrate. 
I'm celebrating my most important birthday alone. All I've ever done is put my friends first. I always planned things for their birthdays. Made sure they were never alone. 
Only to be left alone for mine. I don't even matter. 
I don't live in the same state as my parents because I'm in college and live in that city. 
I feel so pathetic. 
It's my worst birthday since 1st grade.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Couple things I guess. 

Probably the top was when my friends were seniors in college and I was a sophomore. One of our friends had graduated a year early, but he still hung around us a lot. Anyway, it was a Thursday night and we were all planning on going downtown. We were pregaming in their dorm room. 
Note: the friend that graduated early and I had been hooking up since my freshman year. 
So we were on a friends bed with a blanket on our laps. I guess he was feeling horny because he moved my hand to his dick under the covers. Which got me going. 
He left to "go to the bathroom" and I left shortly after him to do the same. 
We met in the hall bathrooms/showers and hooked up in one of the showers. It was super hot. Especially considering there were people in there. 

Another time, me and the same guy were mad at one of the friends. So we hooked up in his bed while he was in the other room.

<TEXT> Saying thank you. 

Sometimes I bust my ass to get something done or to do something for someone that I don't necessarily have to do but they asked me to do it as a favor for them. Most times they say thank you, which makes going through the extra trouble worth it. But when they don't it makes me feel like shit. Like I broke my back to help you and you don't even give a fuck.  </TEXT>

When he's tied up and gagged and whipped and blindfolded I feel really powerful and he feels so submissive and we both love it. He gets so hard and horny and by the time I untie him, he's in me in seconds. BDSM is such a great thing to be into holy shit </TEXT>

<TEXT> My freshman year, my best friend and I were going to a concert. I didn't know about it till last minute, like the week of. So I bought my tickets and I was going to drive us both. I thought he was super excited to go with me.
Well, later I found a message on my other friend 2's phone from him (I wasn't snooping, I was answering a message from Friend 1 he asked me to reply to) and I saw Friend 1 tell Friend 2 "hey let's not mention this to subject7608. Invite all the hot girls you know" which was later followed up with "...guess who is having car troubles and has to tell subject7608 they're going to the concert and convince her to buy tickets so she can drive me. -_-"

So basically he used me to get a ride to a concert. Under the guise of friendship.
It rocked. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got a pixie cut about a year ago, and it was great for the first month or so, but I never realized how much work it would be.  I didn't have time to keep it up and looking nice, and I didn't really think it looked good on me anyway, so I'm growing it out.
Worst. Process. Ever.  
There's a mullet stage.  It's unavoidable.  I didn't want to believe it, but it is unavoidable.  My only advice is to be ABSOLUTELY sure you want to cut it, because once you do, your comfort zone is gone (at least for me, it was).  It was weird because people were looking at my face, which sounds weird too, but trust me it's a feeling lol.  
In short, just be sure it's what you want.  If you don't know for sure, go to your stylist and get a slightly longer but still short cut.  If you're still itching for a pixie, go back a few weeks later!  Doing that would've helped me realize I didn't want the cut, and it could help you realize the same or help you realize that you do want the cut. </TEXT>
