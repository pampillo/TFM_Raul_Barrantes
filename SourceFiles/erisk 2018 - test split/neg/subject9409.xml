<TEXT> I don't think millennials are reluctant to go into a trade - the job market, overall, is tighter and labor regulations are looser. Wage growth has stalled and Canada lost 35,000 full-time jobs, adding 31,000 part-time jobs. Full-time jobs are going away.

<TITLE> Instagram's top competitors in 2017 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-11 01:58:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just wrote an overview of competitors for Instagram that I found in 2017, and thought you guys might be interested. Did I miss any? Who would you consider a threat to Instagram in 2017? Snapchat aside (their marketshare is declining). 

Sorted the competitors into two areas - ones threatening its monopoly on young people, and the other threatening its unique value proposition (photo sharing). Here's the full post: https://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/who-are-instagrams-biggest-competitors-in-2017/

**Instagram Competitors: What Are the Kids Using?**

According to market research data from 2016, Generation Z is branching out to new social platforms. Teenagers still use Instagram and Instagram messengers to stay in touch with friends, but theyre branching out to new platforms as well.

Kik: This messaging platform allows users to text for free, with no limits. As more teens move to the platform, Instagram messaging might lose its appeal. Kik also allows in-app photo taking and sharing, for group messages that centre around snapshots and dank memes.

Musical.ly: Why share videos on Instagram when you can build a fanbase on Musical.ly? For the approximate 1 in 3 middle schoolers who view themselves as the next Beyonce, Musical.ly is the perfect social network. The platform allows users to assemble not just followers, but dedicated fans. As of December 2016, 70 million people had registered as Musical.ly users. Thats a lot of Beyonce covers.

**Instagram Competitors: Start-Ups**

Snapchat and Periscope didnt exist 5 years ago. Instagrams next big competitor could come out of nowhere, too.

Kuaishou: You may not have heard of this photo sharing app out of China, but we will all learn how to pronounce it soon (koo-ay-shoo? kwa-i-shoo? Send help). The app just secured a 350 million injection of funding from Tencent, after an initial round that drew investments from Sequoia and Baidu. You will want to translate this page, as the app looks poised to reach North American users soon.

Path: Is it fair to call Path a startup? Path was founded in 2010. Promising a more personal web experience, Path is one of the most-followed photo sharing startups on AngelList. Path has raised more than $55 million, but has struggled this year to gain market share. Largely due to

Camarilla: Not to be confused with caramilla, which is complimentary slang for someone cute with tan skin. Camarilla allows messaging and photo sharing with just 15 people. The app takes Instagrams private account feature a step further  you cant publish publicly, or have a long follower list. The network allows for intimate, conversational sharing, which just might be the future of social media marketing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You seem to be staying that foreign countries should have let Africans starve to death, to prevent the overpopulation problem. 

I have a lot of problems with that, but your values aside, the birth rate in Africa is the issue, not the death rate. Birth control and family planning foreign aid helped deal with the birth rate problem, particularly in countries where women have few rights and can't choose the number of children they have.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the premise of the book, as summarized in the Semley review: "Simply: Boomers are sociopaths. Theyre antisocial and unburdened by conscience. They squander prosperity, ravage the land of wealth and salt the earth so that the seeds of some future fortune may never again find purchase. As Gibney  a prominent venture capitalist and sometimes-writer  lays it out, his books driving thesis is that Americas present dilemma resulted substantially and directly from choices made by the baby boomers."

The review looks at the quality of the analysis in the book, weighing the evidence it presents against some of its more provocative statements (like the whole sociopath thing).  </TEXT>

"The amendments would make unpaid positions in federal sectors illegal unless theyre part of a formal educational program.

I think its a good first and I think it reflects a really egregious gap in federal labour laws, where unpaid interns working did not have any real protections under the Canada Labour Code, Cash told the Star.

The devil is always in the details with these things and well see what it looks like when they table legislation, but for everyone who has been working on this issue for many years I think this is a good day." </TEXT>

In your list, you want to look at a few key metrics to identify bots and ghost followers: 

 * Ratio of followers/following
 * Latest tweet time
 * Location
 * Bio

Crowdbabble offers follower lists for any Twitter account (we are compiling one on Donald Trump) - link here: https://www.crowdbabble.com/download-all-twitter-followers/ A few other social media analytics companies do as well.

<TEXT> TL;DR: Before you sign a deal, make sure your influencer's followers are real. 

Crowdbabble has developed a new tool to detect and list the bot/ghost followers of an Instagram account. Once you've found an Instagram influencer that you'd like to work with, you can use the tool to audit their audience. You don't want to pay for access to 2 million Instagram followers when only 500,000 of them are real. Here's a write up of why you might consider an audience audit before signing an influencer: https://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/influencer-marketing-on-instagram-how-influential-is-your-influencer-really/

Found this quote, and I love the rhythm. It just rolls: "We were hockey gypsies, heading down another gravel road every weekend, plowing into the heart of that magnificent northern landscape. We never gave a thought to being deprived as we travelled, to being shut out of the regular league system. We never gave a thought to being Indian. Different. We only thought of the game and the brotherhood that bound us together off the ice, in the van, on the plank floors of reservation houses, in the truck stop diners where if we'd won we had a little to splurge on a burger and soup before we hit the road again. Small joys. All of them tied together, entwined to form an experience we would not have traded for any other. We were a league of nomads, mad for the game, mad for the road, mad for ice and snow, an Arctic wind on our faces and a frozen puck on the blade of our sticks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In addition to being an author, he was also an advocate against Canada's residential school system. He wrote a very powerful letter on the subject, excerpt below:

"I am a victim of Canadas residential school system. When I say victim, I
mean something substantially different than Survivor. I never attended a
residential school, so I cannot say that I survived one. However, my parents
and my extended family members did. The pain they endured became my
pain, and I became a victim.
When I was born, my family still lived the seasonal nomadic life of traditional
Ojibwa people. In the great rolling territories surrounding the Winnipeg
River in Northwestern Ontario, they fished, hunted, and trapped. Their years
were marked by the peregrinations of a people guided by the motions and
turns of the land. I came into the world and lived in a canvas army tent hung
from a spruce bough frame as my first home. The first sounds I heard were the
calls of loon, the snap and crackle of a fire, and the low, rolling undulation of Ojibwa talk..."

<TEXT> I think it does make a real difference to home owners, though. Prices have stopped skyrocketing in vancouver, and the same will happen in Toronto.

I agree that it is sort of whack-a-mole, but Canada doesn't have that many large cities that would attract that investment.

If Toronto is brought on board, it could very well become provincial or federal law.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The competitive reports in Crowdbabble are great for benchmarking. You can stack different brands against each other, and see the leader in different areas on social - audience, engagement rate, etc - as well as the industry averages. 

Getting accurate averages in your vertical is really helpful in creating goals for agencies. If no one in your vertical achieved 20% follower growth last year, for example, you can communicate that to clients who are asking you to double their followers. 

Crowdbable is also great for stripping out bullshit that other agencies have done in the past. They do ghost follower analysis, generating a list of the bots who follow any account. Ghost followers do boost your total audience size, but they can wreck things like engagement rate and conversion rate.  </TEXT>

Otherwise, their expectations around follower growth rate and impressions will probably impossible to meet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, this is really tricky for people on a strict budget because in a democracy everyone needs access to the news. On the one hand, if news organizations charged $0, the ads would have to be crazy to support investigative journalism - like video ads before every story, ads all over every page, ads in the middle of stories. On the other hand, if news organizations charge too much, they cut out people who need and deserve access to news. People on a low budget shouldn't have to just be stuck with the headlines only or crappy free news sites. 

It's like movies and music. Once people understood the value of having unlimited streaming, they were willing to pay for Spotify and Netflix. News might just take a while to catch up.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think we might be both wrong, actually. Here are the population growth stats for the GTA over the past 5 years: it seems to be about 100,000 per year, not 150,000.

2006: 5,798,100
	
2008: 6,012,300 (+ 200,000 in two years)
	
2011: 6,292,200 (+ 280,000 in three years)

<TEXT> I think the argument is that by inflating the population of Canada so much, we're building an economy based on artificial growth. The population of Toronto rises 150,000 every year - it's pretty devastating for the environment, for traffic, for subway congestion, pollution, and tearing up farm land to replace it with exurbs. Toronto will stretch all the way to Barrie soon. One of the main drivers of the Ontario economy, agriculture, will be gone. Ontario's debt has continued to skyrocket and there's no money for new infrastructure - like another subway line - so the arguments about creating meaningful growth by just increasing the population don't work. 

This impacts home prices because they'll continue to skyrocket as long as the government inflates them up with high numbers of new immigrants. They're using immigrants to artificially prop up the economy and housing prices, without any sort of long term plan.

This isn't against immigrants on an individual, personal level. Multiculturalism is a huge part of Canada's identity and I think it makes the country stronger. The choice to increase Canada's population so dramatically, over and above making up for the declining birth rate, isn't great for Canada in the short or long term. You can still have lots of immigrants and refugees at more responsible levels, without using them to prop up the economy in such a poorly thought out way.

<TEXT> I suggest the same procedure that's followed for other cases, like you're saying - looking into it properly. 

If my house gets robbed and I go to the police, they go and examine  the scene, look for witnesses of the crime and start an investigation. 

If I get assaulted and I go to the police, they decide based on meeting me whether or not to investigate or go to the scene of the crime. Even if I remember witnesses taking photos of the event, the police won't look for witnesses and they won't go to the scene of the crime before making their founded/unfounded decision (from Ava's story). 

It seems like, from the article, cases of sexual assault are treated very differently from other types of assault or other crimes. Not even a cursory investigation is conducted. If they interview the accused and the accused say they didn't do it, then the charges are dropped - this doesn't happen for any other type of crime.  </TEXT>

Your points are valid, just as mine are. 

I'd disagree on militarizing the police, though. He actively tried to stop that and banned the use of military grade vehicles to police departments. He also opened up federal investigations into the police departments of many cities, including Baltimore and Chicago: http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-obama-police-reform-20160809-story.html </TEXT>

<TEXT> Journalists can help the dems save the country by getting the data to expose him, like the NYT tried to do with a few years of his tax returns.

If you pay $10/month for Netflix or Spotify, you can justify paying $10/month to help destroy Donald Trump. No one is better equipped to do that than the press. We also need non-alternative facts more than ever. 

Washington Post: https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com

The New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions

Dallas News: https://join.dallasnews.com/subscribe

The San Francisco Chronicle: https://offers.sfchronicle.com/offers/1-4?groupid=31

The Globe and Mail (I'm biased, but it's business section has been tracking the fallout from Trump's policies really well): https://sec.theglobeandmail.com/subscription/?intcmp=GAMunlimited_sub

The Guardian: https://subscribe.theguardian.com/int/digital

As a subscriber I get to follow the people best equipped to attack Trump and track their progress  the people who will find the sources, the tax returns, and the info to bring him down. Getting more than just the headlines has made me much more able to argue against Trump supporters. It's also just nice to not have to try to "game" the system and steal content by constantly changing browsers, stopping load before interactive elements come in, etc.

<TEXT> The mission statement tab is one of menu items on the site: https://www.womensmarch.com/mission/ Pretty hard to miss. 

The protest hopes to stop the roll back of womens rights in the US, which Trump seems to want to speed up. The issues range from the right to have an abortion to supreme court picks. 

Everyone at the marches supports womens rights and equality, and is anti-Trump. We are all united on those issues. 

Is staying home more effective? Have you ever been to a protest, or do you just criticize them on the internet? 

The purpose of the protests is very clear. You can't deny that - it sounds like you actually disagree with it. You can't be mad about not knowing information something because you didn't look for the information - it's not going to just magically appear in your feed on Reddit.  </TEXT>

I won't regret marching, but I think a lot of people will regret staying silent when Trump takes away their health insurance and public education funding.  </TEXT>

Early adopters of your business want to be involved from the beginning - you should develop a brand strategy and voice, and then share everything at this point. Early adopters want to be part of your success. If they're with you from the beginning, your customers' brand loyalty will also skyrocket. 

First trainer hired? Share it. First lightbulb turned on? Share it. Location chosen? Share it. Need to choose a paint colour? Ask your Instagram followers. Etc etc etc.

<TEXT> I like Crowdbabble, but I'm biased (I work there). Here's a good summary of our current Instagram analytics: http://crowdbabble.com/instagram-analytics. The ability to schedule reports to your email is what users tend to like the most. 

We're adding new features and an updated design, which you can see here: https://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/new-perspectives-on-social-media-sneak-peek/

The good thing about Crowdbabble is that you can also track accounts on other platforms, so you don't need separate analytics solutions for each one. Rolling up different accounts into one report saves time. If you go with Iconosquare and then need Twitter analytics, you're sort of stuck.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> With Twitter, all of those metrics should be possible to capture without their login/admin access - except impressions. You also won't need historical data since you're not capturing followers, which makes it easier. I recommend that you get a social media analytics solution like Crowdbabble (a few could do what you require) and get the stats in an organized way before and after each shoutout.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do each of the drivers have their own social media channels?

If so, you should be able to track their posts using most social media analytics options, including Crowdbabble (where I work). 

You'll want to track impressions of the post, engagements, and traffic to your website from social. Crowdbabble can also do more custom reports, like getting a list of the Twitter or Instagram handles of everyone who likes/retweets/replies to a post. You just have to set up tracking before the post goes up.

<TEXT> Content marketing is a whole lot of noise that you have to sort through to find the good stuff. 

Very little of it works. You can't build a good marketing strategy based off tips and tricks -- you actually need a more holistic approach. Most of listicles on SME or marketing aggregators are written by poorly paid writers in under 2 hours. These people aren't experts in their fields. The content has little to no value. It drives traffic, but over time, it can actually erode the reputation of the publications or brands. 

I eliminated blogspam from my company's blog for this reason. We replaced lists of tips and tricks with in-depth case studies on social media disasters and the election. The idea is that readers can learn from the fails and wins of brands in their categories. More than they would from listicles, hopefully.

In any case, you should be suspicious of content that you don't have to pay for, which is supported only by ad revenue - that means the writers aren't paid well. There is some good content marketing out there but you typically have to dig to find real insights.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Building a community on Instagram will be key for you  not just pushing content, but finding a real way to interact with your followers. You might also consider Facebook Live to differentiate you from other beauty bloggers - stream looks as you do them. 

What are your main competitors doing? That's something else to investigate. 

Before you launch, you might also consider social media analytics. If you sign up for a service before launch, you'll have all your follower data. Almost all services can't capture historical follower/fan data. They can only get it from the moment you sign up onwards. You'll also be able to add your competitors and see what they're doing on social, and what their top posts are.  </TEXT>

 * Live video and audio

 * Starting to explore AR and VR </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work for Crowdbabble, so I'm pretty biased toward their social media analytics.

For audience research, the dealership should have a bunch of data on their customers. Their ages, incomes, etc. 

In terms of getting involved in the community, you want to build a community on social media. It could for locals who love XYZ brand cars, for car help, for millenial road trip ideas, whatever. A community is way better than a brand that just pushes links and spam. This wouldn't necessarily cost money initially, and you could build this using your social media strategy. You could spend money on community events and free workshops if you end up going that route. 

With any marketing, you have to answer these fundamental questions:

 * Who is my target audience?
 * Where are they? Where do they congregate online?
 * What do they need?
 * How can I give it to them, using social media?

<TEXT> Best of luck! I think you're missing the research phase. 

My suggestions:

 * Look at what competitors are doing on social
 * Analyze your audience and target market
 * Look at what best in class brands that cater to that audience are doing on social
 * Get some social media analytics, to track what competitors are doing - pinpoint their top posts, top performing hashtags, etc
 * Use competitor numbers to come up with realistic goals (if average follower growth for all your competitors is 10% per month, that might be a good goal to aim for)
 * Develop content themes based on competitor and audience research
 * Develop a content schedule / calendar

The other bit you're missing is community building. You can't just push content on social media. You need to interact with your fan base, get them involved, develop a community of car lovers in your area.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Best of luck!

My usual piece of advice is just to check out what your competitors are doing. What are their content themes? Hashtags? How do they interact with their fans? 

Social networking is, above all, community building. If you provide value in your content and interact with your fans in a meaningful way, you'll do well.

You should also be very clear about what you want the Instagram page to do for you. Instagram doesn't drive a lot of traffic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The structure of the site and content are very solid. The colour palette and fonts are also pretty good. My only changes are to some of the styles. 

I think I'd change the top menu items to the serif font that you have for your paragraphs, just to make it look a little lighter. White is a good colour for that. 

I'd change the colour of the red fonts in the Network With Me section. Pull a red directly from your main photo for the icons, and use another colour for the text. 

The three images need to have all the same theme. I love the first image of the mountains, that's a great choice. They're all actually good, individually. But the image of the spark doesn't have anything to do with the mountains, and the forest doesn't look like it's from the same photo set either. 

Since it's such a massive photo, you can zoom in and get smaller pieces for the sections underneath. Also, open the huge photo in Photoshop or another program and save it at 1,400 pixels wide. That's as big as you need for a website. No need for an image as huge as you have (https://bryarcole.github.io/img/jgoerugd_y4-john-towner.jpg).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dang. Sorry about that drop - I blame the new algorithm? 

I think that maybe you can build your community and get those likes by interacting with your audience more. I did some digging - images posted below. 

Looking at your follower growth, it does look like you've slowed down a bit recently: likely due to the lower engagement.

To up your engagement, check out your top hashtags - the ones your followers or any users liked and commented on the most: http://imgur.com/AxDlwuj Forgive the graph weirdness! We're trying a new layout and the PNG download isn't perfect yet. 

You might also post more on Sunday nights and Wednesday afternoons, when your followers comment on your posts the most: http://imgur.com/LfcQNkT The darker the blue in that image, the more engagement there was on that day and at that time. 

Just a few suggestions!  </TEXT>

Cornerstone of the law is not contacting people without their consent. On LinkedIn, it might be more of a grey area, because the emails usually pertain to their industry or business. You could argue that they maybe consented by advertising their name and industry/openness to stuff about that industry on the network. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In terms of thought leaders, I really like AdWeek. Drew Neissen's interviews are also great - he gets giants in marketing to actually discuss their strategies rather candidly.

I also do a monthly roundup of good articles (November here: https://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/2016/12/05/top-reads-for-brand-managers-movember-2016/). The piece on Adidas was my favourite for that month. A lot of lessons from a huge rebrand. I was very surprised, because I don't expect that level of depth from Buzzfeed.

<TEXT> So, #dumpBMW and #dumpKellogg were both pretty unavoidable for the brands. They were trapped - I think that more brands will be trapped in a similar way in 2016.

They're both really interesting examples, becuase not acting and acting were both considered political actions. BMW and Kellogg were both advertising on Breitbart before the election. Some consumers were angry that they were advertising on Breitbart (a right wing website). Others were angry that they were considering not advertising on Breitbart. So, in either case, the brands were being 'political' without any real escape. Taking advertising out = left wing, keeping advertising = right wing. The brands were totally trapped. 

Or, #dumpstarwars was set off with one of the screenwriters tweeted something anti-Trump way back in October. If you're a big brand, how do you prevent that sort of thing? Ban all employees from using social? 

It's very true that this has been going on for a while. I think that with situations like the above, it might heat up this year.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What marketing buzzwords, aside from 'high engagement'?

It's a hard trend to encompass, but it's basically physical processes that unfold flawlessly - see the two sample videos in the article. They're usually labeled "satisfying", "soothing", or "hypnotizing". They do not have a set production value: the video of the man chopping noodles in the article was shot on a phone, and the one of the handwriting machine was obviously made professionally. 

It's not a trend that's actually been identified as such before, so there aren't many other articles about it. It's a hard one to label, but you recognize the videos when you see them. 

In 2016, these videos were usually by individuals and proved extremely sticky. I think brands will adopt them in 2017. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most processes that we interact with are concealed behind a screen, so were more hooked than ever by video that shows physical processes unfold. Humans love to watch amazing things at peak performance: beautiful machines working flawlessly, a process unfolding perfectly, a touchdown executed with great skill. Its hard to come up with an umbrella term for videos that capture these wins. These videos appear under different labels: soothing, flawless, win, watch this [machine or person] do [their job] perfectly.

Brands can capture high engagement with video content showing off the physical processes they perform smoothly. Like the noodle maestro video above, any seamless physical processes showing mastery are basically guaranteed to grab eyeballs. If your brand doesnt have a lot of physical processes to capture, you can create one  as OK GO did in its Rube Goldberg-esque The One Moment music video. Budget seems irrelevant to this trend: low production value videos of dominoes falling in beautiful patterns have millions of views on YouTube.

<TITLE> Social media in 2017, a few predictions </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-01 19:11:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey all! I did a little digging and came up with some predictions for 2017 social media trends. Some trends are huge and will really shift the landscape of social media, some are smaller ones that will likely burn out (like mesmerizing videos). Live video will be big - you've heard that before! 

Here's a link that goes to articles on each of the individual trends with examples and more detail: https://medium.com/@crowdbabble/social-media-in-2017-e604d58e8048#.ndratllpw

For marketers, social media in 2017 will be a challenge and opportunity. With the decline of content marketing and the rise of new technologies, like VR and AI, marketers will have to create new strategies to keep up. The status quo on social is shifting.

**Conversational Social Media**
Your social media fans and followers dont want to hear from you, they want to talk with you. In 2017, social media is going back to its roots.

**Marketing Gets Political**
Culture wars will rage on social media and brands will be caught in the middle. No brand will be able to escape from politics in 2017. 

**Live Video**
There are more opportunities than ever to connect with your audience in realtime. How can you make the switch from evergreen content to on-demand?

**Mesmerizing Video**
This is a smaller trend, but its a powerful one: wonder through video of seamless processes. 

**VR and AR**
Virtual reality and augmented reality are now built into most mainstream social networks. 

What other trends are you guys looking forward to in 2017? Or afraid of? I think that live streaming in virtual reality is going to be massive, since it's now offered through Facebook.  </TEXT>

Facebook is even allowing live streaming in virtual reality (360 degrees), which is pretty incredible. That advance is pretty crazy - it'll allow people to feel like they're part of live events elsewhere, in realtime.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just thought I'd warn fellow email marketers! I used Grabby.io to try to extract emails from a list of websites that mentioned one of the companies I work for. The data itself was garbage - it treated @png and @jpgs as emails, the company won't stop charging me.

I've sent Grabby several emails asking them to stop charging my card and stop the projects, but they've charged me for two extra months. At this point, I don't know how to get them to stop charging me. I've asked them to delete my account, cancel the projects, but I just keep getting charged. I thought the issue was resolved in November, but I checked my credit card statement in December, and there was another charge from them. They're like a really bad gym, I think I might have to cancel my credit card to get them to stop. 

Avoid Grabby.io at all costs!  </TEXT>

This is pretty much a textbook for digital marketing, very well regarded: https://www.amazon.ca/Digital-Marketing-Strategy-Integrated-Approach/dp/074947470X/ref=sr_1_19?ie=UTF8 qid=1482359607 sr=8-19 keywords=marketing

The Whuffie Factor is older, but it's still solid: http://www.thewhuffiefactor.com/ Tons of insight about community building, rather than link selling. 

Social Media - The First 2,000 Years is great for understanding social media in-depth. It explains the appeal of different social media platforms, and looks to their origins in history.

The Art of Immersion is another good one on social media and entertainment, from New York University. https://www.amazon.ca/Art-Immersion-Generation-Remaking-Hollywood/dp/0393341259/ref=pd_sim_14_3?_encoding=UTF8 psc=1 refRID=JSFGKDE8WQC6FVMZ3G0K

<TEXT> Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat are stepping on Periscopes toes. With the exception of Pinterest, almost every social media platform now offers live video, including Twitter, with livestreams of big events like the election debates.

As evidenced by the conversational social media trend, evergreen content is dying. Users dont want to click through slideshows or read how-to articles. They want to know whats going on now in exclusive, exciting experiences that are more valuable because theyre ephemeral. As social media becomes more politicalwith Facebook on the forefront of election coverageinterest in live video will surge because its breaking, raw, uncensored. Grassroots.

The most watched live video of the year, with 164.7 million views, was shot in a car on a smartphone. 

In 2017, how will you shift from evergreen to live content? Do you see yourselves moving into live video?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a really great example of a proactive strategy when it comes to politics - JC Penny picked a side, and it worked really well with their demographics. The brand didn't wait for social media to assume a side/bias for them. 

BMW, Kelloggs, and Star Wars aren't really taking ownership of the left in the same way, even though they've bene put into those categories by the #dump boycotts on Twitter. It'll be interesting to see if it plays out in the same way.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that brands should avoid politics, but most won't be able to in 2017.

Look at Star Wars, Kelloggs, and BMW examples in the article. They did not try to be political. They didn't comment on the election at all. But social media users thrust political perspectives onto them. So now they're embroiled in these big controversies and boycotts that they basically had nothing to do with.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, Kellogg and BMW are in the same situation in that they can't avoid the risks you're talking about. 

If Kellogg and BMW pulled their advertising from Breitbart, they would be attacked by the right. If they kept their advertising on Breitbart, they would be attacked by the left. 

So they can't avoid controversy. Many brands will be caught in a similar catch-22 in 2017, where political views are thrust upon them and staying neutral is impossible. 

There is literally no way, in that situation, for them to stay apolitical. It's a challenge that many more brands will face next year. 

Star Wars is another interesting example, where it was decried as "feminist propaganda" and the hashtag #dumpstarwars got started. How does the franchise avoid politics from there? It didn't seek out politics. It didn't try to participate in the election. But it's embroiled regardless. 

The Burger Chef example is an interesting one (though fictitious), because there a brand was able to bridge the gap between opposing sides. But it also couldn't avoid politics all together.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys! This is Katie from Crowdbabble. I posted this over on /r/socialmedia, but I thought it might be useful for you as well. 

I'm writing a new series on marketing trends in 2017, and the first is culture wars and the increased politicization of social media. It's become impossible for brands to avoid politics on social media. Are your social media accounts boycott ready? Do they have to be? I want to hear your thoughts.

Text below:

The 2016 Presidential Election and Brexit ignited a culture war in the West that many brands became embroiled in. Including your own.

In the 2010's, crowdculture marketing took off as brands embraced likeable causes to increase engagement, like Dove's body positivity campaign. In 2016, politics and identity politics clashed with marketing campaigns in an epic way as crowdcultures became more polarized online. In 2017, that culture war will intensify. No brands will be spared.

Social media users are inundated with political content, and participate in it readily. Does that mean your audience wants a break from politics? Do they want to engage with content that's not aligned with any cause? As seen by #dumpstarwars and #dumpkelloggs, social media users want to know what side your brand is on.

In 2017, brands will struggle to avoid losing followers by picking a side; social media marketers need to be reactive strategies prepared just in case. Alignment can come from anywhere: #dumpstarwars started when a Rogue One screenwriter tweeted his disagreement with Trump. Suddenly, the entire franchises brand identity shifted to the left. The ensuing Twitter debate drew a line between #dumpstarwars and Star Wars supporters, picking a side for the brand when its official channels hadnt sent a single political tweet.

Being proactive and taking a side on social media can be a huge opportunity for small businesses, attracting demographics who agree with your views. But brands wont be able to keep fans and followers who disagree with their politics  even if no views are concretely stated.

Divided audiences are the biggest challenge for big brands that have appeal across crowdcultures and the political spectrum. Lose-lose is possible by staying neutral, but win-win is impossible when picking sides. Social media users will not support brands they disagree with; in 2017, they will go out of their way to attack them.

In 2016 BMW pulled advertising from Breitbart after complaints from female audience members, when its ads appeared next to an article about how feminism makes you fat. The giant was then inundated with angry #dumpBMW tweets and Facebook posts from conservative audience members  appeasing one half of its audience angered the other. The controversy redefined the BMW brand, winning big with some.

In 2017, many businesses and influencers will find themselves in the same predicament as BMW: a catch 22 where both acting and not acting are political, and remaining neutral is impossible. 

Appealing to increasingly polarized audiences who demand alignment on controversial causes is a challenge, probably the biggest challenge, brands will face in 2017. </TEXT>

You need content themes that you stick to regardless of the breaking news - posts that will go up in addition to the breaking news posts.

That's a question you'll need to do some research to answer.

<TEXT> https://www.facebook.com/events/1842737962660749/

I'm obsessed with marbled paper so I will definitely be there! 

The details:

"On December 10, 2016 Navillus Gallery will introduce its new program, with the artist - a series of workshops, artist talks, and mixers to coincide with each new exhibition. 

Alongside the current exhibition, REFLECT:TROPIC 
featuring work by Christie Lau and Kirk Mechar, we will be 
hosting a workshop with Toronto-based artist Christie Lau.

The workshop will demonstrate the process and technique of Laus sculptural frames in her new MSR series. 

Participants will get the chance to experience first hand what it is like to work with the same materials and create the intricate flora that adorn Laus work. In this 2 hour workshop, 
participants will get to sculpt and customize their own frame with the artist and and receive a custom marbled paper with 
personalized calligraphy by Lau." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought you guys might get a kick out of this tweet I found: https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/804432339640037376

Basically, the US government is moving towards an anti-science, climate change is a myth ethos. The House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology tweeted a Breitbart link that climate change was a lie. 

Government tweet: ".@BreitbartNews: Global Temperatures Plunge. Icy Silence from Climate Alarmists"

Bernie response: "Where'd you get your PhD? Trump University?"

Bernie has received more than 11,000 retweets so far. Proof that Twitter isn't all marketing. It's also now a public stage for American politics, where news is created (and then retweeted).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good question! Get a social media analytics solution and add all your competitors to your dashboard. Then do some math: averages for follower growth rate and engagement rate are usually a good place to start. Follower growth rate is really important for defending your KPIs. If your boss wants you to double your followers in a month, you can show that even your top-performing competitor only grows about 20% a month.

<TEXT> A huge part of marketing is knowing how to use good news like this. 

You need to capture all the people who are seeing this somehow, and the surge to your website. I hope that you've updated your site and all your social media channels with the news that you're featured on google play - celebrate it as a major win with all your followers and your existing customers. Two blog posts on your site and on Medium would be a good idea - one, celebrating the feature, the second, with 'how' you got the feature with a unique twist. Celebrate your long-time customers in a big way: the ones who first downloaded and tried your game. This is their win, too. Customers love to be part of their company's success, and it builds brand loyalty. 

Do you get customers emails when they download your app? It would be awesome to capture them on your site. Play our app? Sign up here for more tips, insights, whatever. Then have a simple sign up form where you get their first name, email, and favourite game of all time etc (with social signup options as well). I assume that you want to build more games in the future - getting info about what your current customers like to build more games would be huge. A mailing list is very valuable, even more so if you have their social handles along with it. 

I'd also suggest doing an AMA in a bigger subreddit. 

Could also be a good time for a PR push. Start by emailing a big list of smaller blogs (customized for each journalist), wait a couple of days and hopefully get a few features, and then reach out to bigger sites. Ask if they want to learn more about how the app was made (your unique, special story) or if they want to be the first to test your next game.

<TEXT> Paid fan acquisition campaigns aren't my area of expertise. You might ask over at /r/adtech as well.

A targeted like campaign using a third party application might be your best bet. Like the posts of people who use a specific combination of hashtags, or who follow your competitors. There are tools available so you can do likes when someone matches the filters you've set. Instagress is good for this.

I wouldn't recommend a follow/unfollow campaign. Having really high following numbers will undermine your brands' legitimacy.

HBR's piece on Branding in the age of social media by Douglas Holt is a great place to start. It'll help with the strategy part o f your new job.

People intern there, unpaid, for 3 or 4 summers before they're even considered for paid positions. Most who intern 4 summers in a row do not ever get a job. This means that only students who have their expenses fully paid for by their parents can afford to intern/work there - the demographics are very skewed. Be very cautious.  </TEXT>

What content, tone, and visuals do they like?

What are your competitors doing?

Answering those five questions should help you a lot. If social media comes up, you can use an analytics app like Crowdbabble for the fourth question - get the top posts and key stats for your competitors.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Social media is usually a great area for benchmarking studies because there's so much data available. Many social media analytics companies (like Crowdbabble) create automatic competitive reports, pitting brands against each other. See these data vis: https://www.crowdbabble.com/trump-vs-clinton

You want to use data from competitors, aggregate it, and then come up with realistic goals across different metrics. In social media, those metrics are usually: follower growth rate, engagement rate, number of posts per day.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Due to limits on the Instagram API, it's difficult to grab that info about your account let alone one that you do not have admin access to. Instagram doesn't track gender or age, and some aren't linked up to Facebook profiles with that data. What most analytics solutions do is try to guess based on the pictures. It's not super accurate. 

What's your budget for this?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Developing a good social media strategy will probably take reading a few books and case studies about best in class brands. It depends on how much time/effort you want to invest.

First, answer these questions to form the basis of your strategy:

Who is your audience? How old? What gender? What interests? What cities? What devices? 

What content does your audience like?

What platforms are your audience on?

Why do they go to those platforms? What are they looking for?

What communities are they involved in, or crowdculture movements? (veganism, pop culture feminism, goth, whatever). What platforms are those communities on? How can you get involved in them/leverage them in an authentic way?

What is your goal for a social media presence? What does "exposure" mean?

What is your brand voice / tone / story?

What do best-in-class DJs do to be successful on social?

Once you've got that sorted, you can develop a content strategy, content themes, and a schedule.  </TEXT>

If you can drive traffic to the site, that's the most important thing. Make sure that all the links you share to Facebook are traceable URLs. 

You'll also want to set up Google Analytics to track conversions/sales, so you can show your boss whether or not visitors from Facebook drive sales.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, the Twitter API limits historical data to 3,500 tweets. To access more than that, you'd be using an analytics solution that uses GNIP - a third part Twitter database. And that wouldn't be free. 

These services are pretty expensive to develop and maintain, just due to the sheer volume of historical data they have to capture. You could try building your own using the social media networks APIs and some open source data visualization tools, like D3.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before you do a massive follow/unfollow campaign, ask your friends and family to follow the account and try to get to 100 followers. 

Then, focus on your big picture strategy. Making a social media strategy is basically answering a few key questions. Why do you have this account? What do you hope to achieve? Who is your audience? What do they want? What do best in class artists on Instagram do? 

Once you've answered those questions, you should be golden. You can make a content strategy, develop your content themes, create the content itself, and make a schedule. 

After you've started posting, build your community on the communities of others - shout outs to influencers in your space, sincere compliments on their work, linking to their Instagram accounts from your other social pages, etc. This is the best way to get organic followers - join and help build a real community (aka crowdculture marketing).  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Who won the election on Twitter? A look at total followers, likes, retweets, and replies for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-08 20:52:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Background**
Can social media predict the next president? In December of last year, Crowdbabble launched a series of case studies to find out.

Traditional polls are conducted by phone, with samples sizes in the thousands. With user bases in the hundreds of millions, social media networks provide a much broader reading of public opinion  with unpredictable and often inaccurate results. Do Donald Trumps frenzied fans and followers indicate that hell steal the election? Or do they follow and engage only for the candidates entertainment value?

Here are Donald Trump and Hillary Clintons final positions on social media before election day.

**Final Totals**

The aggregate social data Crowdbabble collected for the election is staggering. From January 1 to November 6, 2016, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton amassed a total following of 48,986,921 across Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. On those three networks, Trump and Clintons posts attracted 495,120,770 engagements. Half a billion likes, comments, shares, retweets, and reactions. And most of them went to Trump.

Graphs and data by social network here: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/in-the-final-hours-of-the-election-who-is-winning-on-social-media/

The biggest engagement gap between the candidates is on Twitter, where Trumps stream of consciousness rage is expressed 140 characters at a time. Throughout his campaign Trump has maintained personal control of his Twitter handle, up until this week. **Trump closed his campaign with 12.9 million Twitter followers; Hillary, with 10.2 million.**

Trump tweets to comment on, or even create, many of his campaign scandals. His first-person, forceful tweets fire up his followers.

On Twitter, Trump stayed ahead with **89,459,006 total engagements to Hillarys 41,572,396**.

Which candidate won the election on social media? Trump and Clintons total followings are 24.3% apart. As of November 6, Donald Trump has 27,902,237 fans across Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to Hillary Clintons 21,084,684.

Donald Trump is further ahead in total engagement, or the number of times people interacted with or endorsed his content on social. In total, from January 1 to November 6, Trump garnered 351 million engagements on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Hillary Clinton attracted less than half Trumps total: 145 million.

**Predicting the Next President**

Crowdbabble collects data for more than 400 metrics on each social platform. Which ones can help predict election outcomes? Based on engagement rate, we incorrectly predicted that Bernie Sanders would become the Democratic nominee. In a later case study, we found a stronger correlation between share of followers and polling percentages for the two.

Total follower share predicted Hillary Clinton's win in the primaries. For Clinton and Trump, social media audience share and the polls share similar parallels. Both are both split. As of November 6, Hillary has 43% of the total audience across Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and will take 50% of the popular vote, according to Monmouth University.

I think he's succeeding in making the election about him, and stealing the conversation with a steady stream of gaffes/scandals. He's had the spotlight online for the duration.

The search and engagement numbers seem comparable - Donald has about double.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wrote another election case study. This is the second-to-last piece in the series that I've been posting here - the last one will be after the election, to see if my prediction is right.

You guys won't believe the total numbers the candidates got up to on social. They're pretty crazy. 

**Background**
Can social media predict the next president? In December of last year, Crowdbabble launched a series of case studies to find out.

Traditional polls are conducted by phone, with samples sizes in the thousands. With user bases in the hundreds of millions, social media networks provide a much broader reading of public opinion  with unpredictable and often inaccurate results. Do Donald Trumps frenzied fans and followers indicate that hell steal the election? Or do they follow and engage only for the candidates entertainment value?

Here are Donald Trump and Hillary Clintons final positions on social media before election day.

**Final Totals**

The aggregate social data Crowdbabble collected for the election is staggering. From January 1 to November 6, 2016, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton amassed a total following of 48,986,921 across Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. On those three networks, Trump and Clintons posts attracted 495,120,770 engagements. Half a billion likes, comments, shares, retweets, and reactions. And most of them went to Trump.

Graphs and data by social network here: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/in-the-final-hours-of-the-election-who-is-winning-on-social-media/

**Predicting the Next President**

Crowdbabble collects data for more than 400 metrics on each social platform. Which ones can help predict election outcomes? Based on engagement rate, we incorrectly predicted that Bernie Sanders would become the Democratic nominee. In a later case study, we found a stronger correlation between share of followers and polling percentages for the two.

Total follower share predicted Hillary Clinton's win in the primaries. For Clinton and Trump, social media audience share and the polls share similar parallels. Both are both split. As of November 6, Hillary has 43% of the total audience across Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and will take 50% of the popular vote, according to Monmouth University. But Trump has 47% of total audience share and in the same poll is predicted to win 44% of the popular vote. Trump's stronghold on social media is invisible to Hillary supporters, and vice versa. On Facebook and Instagram, you see more of what you like in your feed  there are no equal time laws on social media.

More than 200 million engagements and 6 million fans and followers ahead, catching up to Donald Trump on social media is impossible.  If the general election follows the same pattern as the primaries, the social media data collected indicates that Donald Trump be the next President. Trump's larger audience share on social media could be an indicator of a potential win, as it was for Hillary in the primaries. Hillarys current position  lower engagement, with an eleventh hour surge  follows Bernies pattern before he lost the nomination. Trump seized the Republican nomination with a similar social media lead and unpromising polling numbers behind him. But the general election hasn't followed the pattern of the primaries to date; counting on parallels between them will lead to inaccurate predictions.

Donald Trump has won the election on social media. Will that win put him in the White House? We'll know for sure in less than 24 hours.

<TEXT> So exciting! Congrats on the new role. 

I'd definitely set up analytics for your company so you can automate tracking and really monitor your performance. Crowdbabble has Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and with its competitive reports you could stack yourself against local competition. You'll also need a scheduling tool, so you don't lose your mind having to post every single day. 

That's the next thing: look at what your competitors are doing. Twitter is usually not a great choice for retail, but Instagram seems like it could help a lot - particularly if you use local hashtags and get involved in local communities. I wouldn't axe Instagram. 

What are your competitors doing? Before you write any posts, you'll need a brand identity and then a content strategy that comes from that. Look at your competitors and your customer demographics before you start. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Crowdbabble is working on YouTube analytics now and they won't be ready until spring, so I can't help you there. It does have the other three plus LinkedIn.

If you only want to track that one metric, I might suggest just doing it manually. Seems crazy to pay a monthly fee that includes hundreds of metrics if you just want the one.

Keep in mind that analytics services can only track your follower growth going forward, due to API limits. Once you sign on, they will begin to count your followers going forward. But getting historical info is tough.  </TEXT>

You can also try giving an 'exclusive' discount to whatever coffee clubs are on campus. Make agreements with local roasters to carry their beans - you will get discounts if you buy in bulk. Plus street cred with people who know their coffee. You might also consider a special discount for a particular tier - like faculty, or seniors. 

From there, Instagram and the right hashtags should help you attract students. I'm not sure if a Facebook Page or a Twitter profile will be worth it for you. If someone Instagrams their coffee and shares it with you, they should get something free. Like an extra punch in a loyalty card. 

In terms of the cart construction, definitely don't just wing it. Follow health department codes to the letter and look at how other carts are built.  </TEXT>

Findings for 2015 are presented here, and findings for 2014 are included in Appendix C. We use the GD-IQ, a revolutionary new automatic audio-visual tool  the first of its kind developed specifically to analyze media content."

The automated tool used to compile the data: "GD-IQ is the only software tool in existence with the ability to measure screen and speaking time through the use of automation. This revolutionary tool was co-developed by the Institute and led by Dr. Shrikanth (Shri) Narayanan and his team of researchers at the University of Southern Californias Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory (SAIL), with additional analysis from Dr. Caroline Heldman."

The findings: "Male characters received two times the amount of screen time as female characters in 2015 (28.5% compared to 16.0%). In 2015, male characters spoke two times as often as female characters in the top box office movies (28.4% compared to 15.4%)." </TEXT>

I think these companies just have to get comfortable with the fact that the code they're asking for is going to be garbage. Or, they should admit that they need to hire a developer and that the user experience is going to come second.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's likely that the attack on October 21 led to a drop in your engagement, or even tweeting, because people couldn't access Twitter. You might consider noting and omitting October 21 from your reporting numbers for this month, because the drop will skew all of your averages. 

If you use an analytics tool like Crowdbabble, you'll probably note a drop in engagement rate and average follower growth on that day. Be sure to note the attack if you report out to clients or colleagues, so it's clear that the drop wasn't due to a flawed strategy or bad tweet on your part.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys! We're testing out a new feature for brands on Instagram and I thought I'd give away a few trial lists. First three people to reply will get one (API limits = can't provide for everyone). 

The lists capture the Instagram users who like or comment on a post from a particular account. I don't think this list would be useful for personal accounts - it was built by Crowdbabble based on a request from a marketing agency. Use cases:

 * Comparing the engaged users list to your follower list, and figuring out what percentage find your content because they follow you vs what percentage find your content in some other way
 * Planning an interaction / outreach campaign to those engaged users with the list
 * Contests (like/comment to be entered in...)
 * Understanding who is engaging with your content in general

Let me know in the comments to this post. First three is the most fair, I think. I'll then PM you to get the post URL that you want to look at. 

Edit to add: Sorry for the confusion! This feature is hard to explain. I can generate a list of users/people who have liked and commented on an Instagram post - some of these people will be your followers, some will just be randos who found your content. Those are two different list types (https://www.crowdbabble.com/download-all-instagram-followers/).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What are your goals? 

What number of clicks through to your website would you need to meet them?

Working backwards and then shifting the proportions dedicated to paid advertising, SEO, and/or content/PR/influencers/whatever else should help you find a holistic strategy that you can afford. 

Once you have your goals and the number of clicks you need, you can calculate costs on each social platform and with Google Adwords. If 1% of your web traffic converts, then you need 100 clicks to get 1 conversion. If each click costs about $2 (on LinkedIn, for example), then to get that one sale, you're looking at $200. 

There are other ways to drive traffic other than paid advertising, obviously. SEO, content writing, etc should also be part of your plan - you should figure out how many backlinks you need to compete with your competitors (semrush is great for this), and how many blog posts you want to publish per week. You can estimate costs from there.  </TEXT>

Once a month I'll also download all Twitter followers for Crowdbabble's account and see what hashtags they're using (the download also pulls each follower's most recent tweet).

<TEXT> So, the Instagram API does not allow you to track mentions easily. You can track hashtags - so that should be the easiest. It's easier to get users per hashtag on Twitter than it is on Instagram, but you could do either. 

You'll want to set up your analytics before the campaign begins. Essentially, you will need the names of all users who use a specific hashtag - and then you'll cross-reference these lists to see which users used the most hashtags. No one has to register before using a hashtag. I'd make sure to put up a big poster with the hasthag and the contest info in each location to give people an incentive to post. You could also require two hashtags: one for the specific location #locationcontest, one for the contest in general #contest. You could then just count the number of times people use #contest, and go through and check to ensure their posts are set up well.  

What sort of volume are you expecting? How many hashtags/locations? You could just count all the posts manually for each hashtag and make your own lists. Or, you could pay an analytics service to do this. I work for Crowdbabble and we create custom lists like this all the time. You could also sign up with a hashtag tracking tool if you're going to be running more hashtag campaigns in the future.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You need a plan and a content strategy in order to do social media well. You also need a plan in order to defend yourself: you can say, "that's not in the plan."

One of the things that's annoying about social is everyone thinks they can do it. I once had someone tell me that no one schedules content and if I did, I was an amateur.

Develop content themes, make a content schedule, and stick to it. Have an open planning session once a month where people can pitch in their ideas - and then do not take much feedback outside that meeting.

One of the best things you can do is use numbers to defend yourself. Do you use social media analytics? I work for Crowdbabble, and there are a bunch of metrics you can use to direct your content strategy. The most commonly used one is top performing posts - you can see which posts perform the best for your company and your competitors, and use that to inform your content strategy. When people question your strategy or make suggestions, you can counter with: "sorry, those types of posts didn't perform well. Here are the numbers."

<TEXT> Crowdbabble provides most engaged followers and most influential followers, but not most influential engaged users. Good idea for a new metric! We could create a custom report to get you this info, but it's not currently part of our platform. PM me if you're interested. 

If you want to do this for free, is there a way that you could manually go through the retweets or perform a search to see who interacted with the tweet?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Crowdbabble is a great solution for Twitter, Facebook, instagram, and LinkedIn. It's a social media analytics startup based out of Toronto. I'm biased, but the brand reports help you track multiple accounts and they aggregate data so you can see total audience + engagement numbers. We're going to roll out notifications for viral metrics soon (like the alarms you mentioned).

I don't know of a tool that does Twitter (performance measurement) and Reddit (social listening). Reddit is a different animal, as I'm sure you're aware - a lot of the metrics aren't commensurable because subreddits do not function like brand accounts. You can't measure likes/comments/engagement in the same way.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you want to do this just once? What network? 

Most analytics services provide fan location for Facebook - the social platform tracks this in their API. Instagram does not share follower location with its API, just latest tagged location. On Twitter and Instagram, many users do not enter their real locations - they write things like "wherever the wind takes me" or "my boat". That makes the location metric tricky. 

I can't think of anything free, but there are options where you can download all your followers and sort them by location. Crowdbabble provides a download of all Twitter followers that includes two versions of location for each user: the location stated in their bio, and the tagged location of their latest tweet (if available). It's not free, though.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Have you guys published a Moment on Twitter yet? If you used Storify, you'll already know the basics. Moments make Twitter a content platform like Buzzfeed and Tumblr most of the Moments I've seen so far have been listicles of funny tweets. 

**What are they?** Moments allow you to compile any tweets from any account into a single story or list. One key difference between Moments and Storify: you can't add descriptions to Moments. The order the tweets are in / the tweets themselves have to explain themselves.

**How do I make one?** I wrote up two guides, a short version and a long version. You can find a step-by-step with pictures here: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/how-to-make-a-twitter-moment/ Pro tip: it's a lot easier to copy and paste the URLs of the tweets you want to use, rather than try to find them within the Moments interface. You'll do too much scrolling. 

Here's the short version:

 * Login to Twitter
 * Navigate to the Moments interface: twitter.com/[yourusername]/moments
 * Select Create New Moment
 * Choose a title, description, and cover image
 * Use the four search options within Moments to find and add tweets to your Moment
  * Tweets Ive liked
  * Tweets by account
  * Tweet search
  * Tweet link
 * Organize your Moment using the up/down arrows beside each tweet
 * Publish and share

Hope that helps! </TEXT>

<TEXT> These are tough metrics, but you can find them. Twitter does not record age or gender, so those "easy" ones can be hard to suss out - not impossible. 

Let's imagine that all 300,000 followers are following 100 accounts themselves. That means you're actually looking for a 300,000 master list, and then 300,000 smaller lists - adding up to 30,000,000. If your client wants an Excel sheet with **30 million rows**, they're going to have to pay for it. 

Crowdbabble can do this. The analytics platform provides lists of followers with 20 metrics per follower, including influence, latest tweet, and location.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great job on those interviews! I've written a series about people who have accidental virality - their audiences are typically too broad to be sustained with their content, so they quickly fade over time.

With you, your readers are deeply interested in your brand already. You have to figure out what they like. 

What are the demographics of the people who read your HuffPo and La Repubblica pieces? See if you can find anything out. Check your Google analytics: what affinity categories and demographics show up?

Then, refine your content strategy to strike while the iron is hot. Push out content that they'll like - and get them into your funnel. How does your funnel work now? Do you have a newsletter, a way for them to opt in without buying? Are you giving away a trip to Italy if your Instagrammers sign up to your newsletter and follow you? That would be huge for them. Also, I'd suggest getting some social media analytics here to track your growth - I recommend Crowdbabble (where I work - I am biased), but you can also do it manually.

Finally, create a relationship with InStyle and HuffPost Italy. Reach out to the journalists, thank them, ask them follow up questions, ask for intros to their editors, stay in touch.  </TEXT>

I'm very much against universities acting as job training - smart students can train themselves, and education should be much more theoretical and adaptable (in my opinion). I worry that all of these 'bootcamps' actually just teach tools, skills that expire quickly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey there! Social media for theatre is hard - there's so much out there! If you go the traditional route of pushing links, you are going to struggle. 

Getting publicity in local blogs (online) and local businesses (offline) will be really important for you. Via email, reach out to all the smaller outlets in your city with an offer for free tickets and great copy selling the show. In person, go from business to business hanging up posters. 

For Women, a Toronto Fringe mashup of Little Women and the TV show Girls, I created a Twitter account in the voices of the characters - this was a good hook for getting local blogs to cover the show. I would include a link to the Twitter account when emailing local outlets, and the tweets sold the show to them. (twitter.com/bethdiesto)

On both Facebook and Twitter, don't just push links. You should have content themes that don't just push users to the ticket buying page, but provide value up front. If you can include jokes or quotes from the play as your posts, you'll be providing value. These should be shareable, and will draw more people towards your play. On Facebook, we did quotes from Little Women with gifs from Girls. We also did cast bios - these were always shared by the cast. https://www.facebook.com/bethdiestoronto/

On all your social networks, remember not to be spammy. For the play, on a few days right before the show, we made the error of posting too much. Our engagement went down. Limit your posts to two per day - and make sure that one of those posts doesn't push links. 

Finally, it's important to look at your competitors and best in class brands. What are big theatres doing? What can you learn from them? You can use this to inform your content strategy, and to set goals. It's important to have hard goals for things like Likes and Followers before a show, as well as engagement rate.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a huge budget for a small company! There are a few different tools you can use to achieve your goal of more sales. The person you hire should know them well, and have proven success with them before. 

Targeted ads: on Facebook, these can be huge. Figure out your demographic (Google Analytics can help), aim for that demographic,  and go after it. A great way to do this is by using the pages that your target demographic would like - for example, what shows would your target demographic watch? On Facebook, you can target people by those details.

Social media / content marketing: Do you want to establish your brand on social media? It could be that for your business, social media doesn't convert customers. Since you're primarily visual, I think Pinterest would be huge for you. 

PR: Customers want social proof from influencers and media outlets. Profiles of your company on blogs - even small blogs - can help a ton.

Deals and partnerships: sites like Groupon can be a really good source of income for new businesses. You should also look to the businesses in your neighbour: what is a complimentary service? See if there's a store close to you that you could partner with (buy X from the other store, get a 50% discount on canvas prints; and vice versa).   

Social media and web analytics: You need to track this person's progress. When you hire a marketing specialist, they should provide goals based on the sales you want to reach. Good analytics tools will allow you to track their progress and see if they actually meet those goals.  </TEXT>

A company that disrupted an industry couldn't replicate its innovation, due to interesting hiring changes and the departure of its founder. Really cool read.

If possible, get a photographer friend (or do this yourself) to get photos of your products in action. What is the best possible use case for your product? With your exact demographic, at the exact right time? Go photograph it. Then do a full-width "hero" image or footer image at the bottom of the site. 

Social proof is key. Can your family and friends give testimonials? A picture of them with their first name and a review can help a lot. These can't be fake reviews - they actually have to use the product.

There are no standard times for posting. How could there be? Audiences are different. You want to hit your audience at the exact right time, not at standard times that might fit them. You can track when your followers are online using graphs like this: http://imgur.com/gallery/02gvJ

In terms of UX: the scroll arrows point directly to your resume - but your resume opens in a new tab. The placement makes it look like the two are connected, which they are not.

<TEXT> This looks pretty cool!

The aesthetic on the homepage is so crisp and bold. When you actually show the items, that aesthetic kind of goes away - the fonts are more basic, the thumbnails are all stretched out. I'd at least increase the letter spacing on the headers so that it matches the font on the above the fold landing page, to start. 

Your view event button and time shouldn't have the same format - one is clickable, one isn't. 

How can I sort the events? What filters can I apply? My budget is Y and I like music X. Where should I go? Don't make me read them all.

Your menu items  are a little tiny for easy reading.

The slider doesn't make sense to me, with different versions of the same picture. Pick one - a stronger image, maybe, and choose text that doesn't need a shadow. The Welcome to Jetura Media slide isn't useful. You need to emphasize your value up front.

Paragraph font under Why Hire? is also pretty tiny. 

How do they actually hire you? You need a big Get Started Now button or some sort of form on the front end. 

If you'd like more detailed feedback, PM me. 

What industry are you aiming at? I'm not sure that the samples go together. Maybe categorizing them by industry would be better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for writing such a detailed analysis. The article had to be published on the Sunday after the scandal, hence the short analysis time. Looking at the numbers after that, Trump's follower growth was depressed for a week after the tweet while Hillary's stayed higher than normal. If I have only a short window, I usually check back a week after and if my conclusions are incorrect, I'll add a note with an update. 

You're right about the scaling on the graphs -- it adjusts to each candidate, so it's hard to compare them. That's why I included some competitive analysis graphs with the same scale. I thought it was interesting that Republicans have so many more social media fans on Facebook than the Democrats. 

Conservative outlets report that only around 10% of black Americans rate Donald Trump "very favourable". The Washington Post article from July said it was 6%. I checked those out numbers before writing the piece. I do think that the tweets after the scandal are a reflection of how black voters feel about Trump. "Die in a grease fire" covers it.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Took a look at this social media crisis over the weekend, where Donald Trump tried to hijack a tragedy - where the grieving family's politics were opposite to his own. He also misspelt Dwyane when he did it. Pretty interesting! Wrote up a case study for the company blog, which I have pasted here (go to the blog to see the graphs).

Dwayne Wades cousin was just shot and killed while walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!  Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump)

Full article here: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/donald-trump-dwayne-wade-and-the-outrage-machine/ 

When running a campaign, when is it a good idea to co-opt a personal tragedy for retweets and votes?

For brands, the answer is definitely never. For Presidential candidates, politicizing a persons death  especially when their politics are counter to your own  is usually a fire-starter. But Donald Trumps campaign runs out outrage. The Republicans baiting tweets often work for him, not against him.

Will the Dwyane Wade gaffe destroy Donald Trump on Twitter? Or is the mistake another key step in Trumps shock-and-awe strategy?

**Gun Control vs. Tough on Crime**

In the 2016 Presidential election, a key differentiation point between candidates is the second amendment. Hillary Clinton has positioned herself as the gun control candidate; even Bernie Sanders is against background checks. Hillary has succeeded in gathering support from minorities living in urban centres due to her voting record on gun control and emphasis on anti-violence policies in her campaign.

Donald Trump, as the Republican nominee, has taken on the partys values around the right to bear arms. According to Fox News, Donald Trump is running as the law-and-order candidate; he frequently uses #MakeAmericaSafeAgain on his Twitter account. Sometimes, it can be difficult to tell if his tweets are tough on crime or tough on minorities.

Trumps Dwayne tweet didnt come across as tough on crime to everyone. Throughout his campaign, Trump has been criticized for racism, including statements against the blacks. Appropriating a gun violence tragedy for his campaign, particularly one involving minorities he has sidelined, read as opportunistic on social media. Trumps political views couldnt be further from those of the grieving family, making the tragedy a poor fit for his campaign. Misspelling Dwyane the more conventional way added insult to injury.

Did the tweet impact Donald Trumps momentum on Twitter?

**Trump Falls Out**

Caught in the crossfire of a fight that had nothing to do with her, on August 26 Nykea Aldridge was shot while taking her daughter for a walk in her stroller. That night, Dwyane Wade tweeted about his cousins death, condemning gun violence. In replies to Wades tweet, Trump followers got to him before Trump did.

Donald Trump tweeted at 9:24 AM the next morning, on August 27. By that afternoon, the story had been picked up by most major news outlets and aggregators like Jezebel.

Dwayne Wades cousin was just shot and killed while walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!  Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump)

Response to Trump's tweet from Wade and other outraged Twitter users was swift and brutal. Donald Trump quickly deleted the original tweet and sent out a corrected version, with the right spelling of Dwyane  and the same message.

After retweeting Trump, comedian Don Cheadle asked the candidate to die in a grease fire.

Criticism of Trump from other outraged Twitter users quickly followed. Hashtag #dwyanewade took off.

With the misspelt tweet, Donald Trump thrust himself back into the spotlight. Trump, not the tragedy, was at the centre of the conversation around #dwyanewade on Twitter.

**Centre of Attention**

After Trumps tweet on August 27, mentions of the candidate were higher than average on Twitter.

His handle @realDonaldTrump received 5,978 mentions on August 27. His corrected tweet, not misspelling Dwyane, attracted 30,523 total likes and retweets. The tweet perceived so negatively received Trumps average per-tweet engagement, well ahead of his least-engaging tweet over the past two weeks, which received just 5,444 likes and retweets. Donald Trumps followers seem to be encouraged by outrage from the other side.
Outrage fuels engagement for Donald Trump on social media. By baiting the media with offensive statements, like his criticism of the Khan family or Mexican immigrants, Trump receives more attention and engagement. Since his tweet about the personal strategy of Dwayne, his reach on social media and in the news has only increased.

**Hillary Sweeps In**

Donald Trump goes out of his way to attract criticism from left-wing social media users because it reaffirms his outsider, conservative brand for his voting base. Pillorying the liberal elite ups his conservative cache for Republicans. The more opposition Trump can draw from them, the more authentic and powerful he seems.

Still, in solidifying his base, Trump might be alienating some Republicans. Even right-leaning publications like New York Daily News criticized the Dwayne tweet as insensitive and pompous. As shes done throughout her duel with Trump, Hillary has leveraged this crisis to her advantage. On Twitter, Hillary reminded followers about Trumps racist past business practices, like not renting to black tenants.

In the wake of Trumps mistake, Hillary has used these strategic reminders to undercut the purported sincerity and concern in Trumps tweet. On August 26, the day after the tragedy, her follower growth spiked.

**Will Outrage Put Trump or Clinton in the White House?**

From Elizabeth Warren to Dwyane Wayde, Trump draws liberals into Twitter battles that cannot be won on the terms of common sense or reason. Sensationalist messaging draws the spotlight back to his campaign and his policies, bringing with it higher engagement.

By encouraging outrage, Trump seems to win, no matter the outcome. But his divisive tweets come at a price to his reputation among more moderate voters.

For him, a good website where people can order prints and a solid Instagram presence will be key. To ensure no one 'steals' his work, he might consider watermarking them in the corner.

I'm not sure if a company would pay for employee portraits. He does not strike me as a B2B business model, but then again, he might be able to do commercial photography. 

You'd also have to do a full brand identity for him. Again, competitors can help you here. Edward Burtynsky is a famous photographer and his presence is pretty bare bones - which matches his aesthetic. http://www.edwardburtynsky.com/site_contents/Current/introCurrent.html His website also matches his books.

<TEXT> You'd have to look into the train options more closely, but you could easily take a train to Fort William from Edinburgh (about 5 hours). The Jacobite train then goes up to Mallaig and back. You'd then take the train from Edinburgh down to London, the milk route that goes along the coast. 

Flying option 1:

 * Fly Dublin -- Edinburgh
 * Your nights in Edinburgh
 * Edinburgh -- Fort William (regular train)
 * Fort William -- Mallaig (Harry Potter train)
 * Night in Mallaig
 * Mallaig -- Fort William (Harry Potter train return)
 * Fort William -- London (regular train)

Flying option 2 (one more stop):

 * Fly Dublin -- Inverness
 * Inverness -- Fort William (regular train)
 * Night in Fort William (or you could do Inverness)
 * Fort William -- Mallaig (Harry Potter train)
 * Night in Mallaig
 * Mallaig -- Fort William (Harry Potter train return)
 * Fort William -- Edinburgh
 * Your nights in Edinburgh
 * Edinburgh -- London (regular train)

If you don't want to take the train both ways from Fort William to Edinburgh, you could take a bus then a ferry from Dublin to Fort William. 

Ferry option: 

 * Dublin -- Larne, Northern Island (2hr bus / taxi / shuttle / bicycle?)
 * Larne -- Ayr (Ferry)
 * Ayr -- Fort William (train)
 * Night in Fort William (you'll probably need this if you go the ferry route -- will be difficult to do the whole journey on one day and get the times coordinated)
 * Fort William -- Mallaig (Harry Potter train)
 * Night in Mallaig
 * Mallaig -- Fort William (Harry Potter train return)
 * Fort William -- Edinburgh (regular train)
 * Your nights in Edinburgh
 * Edinburgh -- London (regular train)

<TEXT> Why Liverpool? 

I love your itinerary so far, but I do not get Liverpool. Fly Dublin to Edinburgh. 

If your GF likes Harry Potter, go to Edinburgh, where it was written. You can sit at the little table in the Elephant cafe where J K Rowling wrote the books, and look out the window where she saw Edinburgh Castle (which is what Hogwarts is based on). 

I would do:

 * 4 nights in Dublin (3 full days)
 * 3 nights in Edinburgh (2 full days)
 * 2 nights in the highlands - 1 in Fort William, 1 in Malaig -- this is so you can take the Jacobite / Harry Potter train (for the true fan)
 * 3 nights in London (take the train along the coast, aka the milk route, and do not do any train travel in the UK on Sundays, when all track work is done)
 * 3 nights in Amsterdam
 * 4 nights in Rome

That gives you at least two full days in each place with no travel. 

Bring a great rain jacket if you're going in March. I'd suggest April or May. May in Scotland is beautiful. </TEXT>

Create some media assets to be shared by key players in advance: images and posts that can be shared on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 

Along with the hashtag, people should be tweeting a bit.ly/donatenow or bit.ly/getyourtickets link that goes to a webpage where people can donate. They can either buy tickets or just donate in a few clicks. 

Once you've got the hashtag and link made, you should get those to the bands as soon as humanly possible. Pre-write some tweets and facebook posts for them as well, individual ones for each band. 

Hyper target your Facebook ads to people in certain locations who also like the bands who are playing.

<TEXT> 1. Find a contest deadline or 10 that match the genre you want to write in. Do the same for journal entry deadlines for tiny journals and websites that publish fiction. 

2. Write short stories first, even just scenes of your book

3. Ideally, workshop them with other authors

4. Submit them to the contests and journals

5. Whether you're rejected or accepted, you're a real author now. 

If you wait until you write that huge book all in one fell swoop, you will wait forever.

If you want to be filthy rich, master writing and then get extremely lucky and sell ten million copies (authors typically get 10% of list price in a conventional publishing deal). Journalism is tough: investigative journalists can maybe earn $75,000 per year if they're at the top of their fields. The barrier to entry in journalism is one of two things: a Masters from a prestigious program, and/or a portfolio of solid investigative pieces that actually prompted change, published in well-regarded papers (any size -- doesn't have to be big). Most entry level journalism jobs pay $20,000 to $30,000 , even in major cities. If you balk at those salaries, that's a sign that you don't love journalism enough to make the sacrifices needed to actually be a journalist.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're going to be ordering from China and doing branding in house, you'll be handling inventory and shipping yourselves. That will make your margins razor thin.

In terms of branding, you have to start with research.

First, figure out your audience and influencers in that space. Create user personas and find all the info you can about your target market. 

Next, figure out your brand identity based on your audience's needs/wants/location/other demographic info.

Finally, to fine tune your strategy, look at your competitors who are going after the same audience: who is the best in class in your category? What are they doing in terms of branding and social media? 

To set goals before creating a marketing strategy, use your competitors/peers to bench mark. Get real data using social media analytics and make a timeline with actual numbers to hit.  </TEXT>

If you have an engaged, sincere social media following, and you're engaged with influencer in your industry, you have a much higher chance of success. Launching a Kickstarter to just friends and family -- with no social media traction -- will be a lot tougher.

People reached is key, possibly more than likes, comments, and shares. Negative Feedback is also important: that measures the number of blocks/reports/unlikes your page got. Crowdbabble measures all of these for multiple accounts from one dashboard, but it would be hard to calculate manually. Engagement is easy to calculate manually and if you want to do it yourself, then that would save you money.  </TEXT>

My eye first went to the Add+ button within the test app. Maybe have the screenshot more obvious as a screenshot - give it a shadow, fade it, whatever. 

I don't like the double Get Started, one in the side navigation and one as a button. That's confusing. If the side navigation is meant to be steps, it needs to be more differentiated -- all caps, fainter font, whatever.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Rank all of your Facebook posts by reaction [new feature] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-12 17:20:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys! Facebook reactions, in terms of social media marketing, is like a very blunt form of sentiment analysis. Reactions tell you how your content makes your Page fans feel. 

Sorting your content by reactions gives you important insight: you can see which content themes elicit which emotions, and the amount of engagement overall they get. You can do this manually, or with a social media analytics tool. Depending on how often you post on your page, you could easily jot down the reactions manually in Excel and then use the Sort function to rank your posts by reaction. Make a row for each post and a column for each reaction type, then use the Data-- Sort -- Sort By -- [choose a column] to sort your posts. 

To automate this process, you can use a social media analytics tool. Below, I walk through how to use Crowdbabble to sort all of your content for any time period by reaction. So, for example you can see what posts make your fans the happiest or angriest, and which ones drew the most likes/reactions overall.

First, login to your account and from your dashboard add a Facebook page (you can make an account here: http://www.crowdbabble.com/app/signup_trial). You can add a Facebook Insights report if you have admin access to the page, or a Public report if you do not (if it's a competitor, for example).

Once your data has loaded, click on the report and choose your date range. For a huge (proto-)sentiment analysis of all your posts, choose February 26 as your start date. That's the day Facebook Reactions launched globally.

Next, navigate to the Content tab. In the Content tab, click All Posts. You'll then see All Posts by the page during that time range. Scroll down and load them all, then click the individual reactions to sort the table by reactions. You can also sort by comments, shares, and total engagement.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think it looks cheap, but it depends on how you use them. Ideally, they'd be partially integrated into the tweet itself, not all dangling off the end. And you really shouldn't use more than 3 or 4 -- that does get spammy. If you don't use any hashtags or links, your tweets will appear less spammy. But if you're already trying to get people to click a link, you might as well include some hashtags. 

Good hashtag use: Anyone else dig this new #design? http://www.thedesign.com I really love the use of blue here. #ui #webchat

Bad hashtag use: Anyone else dig this new design? I really love the use of blue here. http://www.thedesign.com #webchat #ui #ux #web #design #chat #ifollowback 

You can use social media analytics to find the most engaging number of hashtags for you. Crowdbabble tells you your most engaging and least engaging hashtags, and engagement per number of hashtags used. It could be that after 5 hashtags, your engagement radically drops -- or maybe your followers like that. It really depends on your audience and the communities of the hashtags you use. What's your Twitter username? I'll load up the graph for you and post it here.  </TEXT>

Online courses have low success rates because people lose motivation. Your school is another great opportunity to learn programming. Email the computer science department to ask about auditing or taking courses.

<TEXT> America's best interest can be interpreted many ways, and Trump would interpret it as protecting big business (not workers). He'd protect the GDP at all costs and would further hollow out the middle class, a trend which in the end, will destroy the American economy.

Clinton, on the other hand, has co-sponsored many bills that protect small businesses and workers -- like a bill that offered tax credits to small businesses that provided health insurance.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Starting from 0: I looked at how 4 startups built small, sincere audiences on social media </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-27 05:19:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey, entrepreneurs! I looked at the social media strategies of four startups to try to find lessons for the rest of us. How do you build an audience when you're starting with 0 followers? 

This isn't a get-followers-fast post. I looked at 4 startups who are slowly building audiences, organically. 

Here's a link to the full article, with the images mentioned: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/starting-at-0-social-media-for-new-businesses/


**The Challenge**
Building a brand can be a challenge for small businesses on a shoestring budget. A creative approach to social media can have a huge impact, at a very low cost. But when you start with zero followers, how can you build an audience?

Many small businesses turn to either buying likes on Facebook or furiously following and unfollowing people on Twitter and Instagram to inflate their audiences, somewhat artificially. This approach can damage your brand at the outset: inauthentic growth will make potential customers question your brands authenticity in other areas. If your online audience is fake, your brand promises, reviews, and value might be fake as well. I looked around the new brands in my own social network and the incubator where Crowdbabble is based to find examples of real growth: of users finding and following brands not just for a #followback, but because they find value in the brand and the content it shares.

The small businesses below have successfully cleared the first hurdle of social media marketing: building a small, but real audience of fans online. How did they do it?

**Arti Designs Her Life: A Lifestyle Blog**
Arti Designs Her Life is an inspirational blog run by Arti Joshi, where she discusses her journey through the world of following your passions and who splits her time between London and far-flung locations like Australia and Indonesia. The blog launched in August 2015 and has experienced slow and steady growth to 500 WordPress followers and 110 very dedicated Facebook fans. On Facebook, Joshi has achieved what few other small businesses have: an almost equal proportion of shares to likes. Likes require less effort, and usually signal that fans are closer to the top of the funnel  less likely to convert. Because Facebook shares extend your reach to entirely new audiences (they push content onto your fans feeds for all of their friends to see), theyre much more powerful for increasing reach.

45% of fan engagement with Arti Designs Her Life on Facebook is shares. This indicates that her early adopter fans are brand advocates: though the page has a small audience, its very powerful. From March 2015 to March 2016, this highly engaged audience gave Joshis Facebook page an engagement rate of 152%.
Joshis ability to attract such a high proportion of shares might lie in her content strategy: her Facebook page is focused on videos with an inspirational lean.

When Joshi posted two interviews in quick succession, in early March, her Facebook Page Likes increased dramatically. By creating video content and interviewing with bloggers who have more Facebook fans, Arti engaged two active audiences: her own brand advocates, and those of her interviewees. With this approach, her Facebook fan base should continue to grow organically and she should be able to amass an even higher proportion of brand advocates.

**SlimCut Media: Tech Startup**
SlimCut Media is a Toronto-based startup that offers advertising solutions to online media, including news sites. Though its ad solutions boast more than 1 billion page views, translating those viewers into brand advocates on social media hasnt been easy. As a B2B startup, SlimCut faces a unique challenge on social media: its solutions arent aimed at most consumers and their audience is much narrower. On Twitter, SlimCut has successfully attracted followers interested in the companys progress. 

The companys most successful tweets arent about its industry, but about SlimCuts milestones as a startup. Photos and status updates, rather than industry news links, are the most engaging for @SlimCutMedias audience.

According to startup social media expert Brent Stirling, speaking as a person, rather than a faceless company, is the best way for new businesses to grow their audiences. SlimCuts focus on its progress as a team of people, rather than a company in a B2B industry, is aiding its follower growth.

**A Piece of the Party: Videography Company**
This new business delivers on the promise of fun in its name. Its CEO  London-based Lauren Garvey  has carefully built a trendy brand that delivers playful, authentic videos of important events. A Piece of the Partys brand is that its not your mothers wedding footage. Shareable content is built into the business model: who can resist footage of the first time the groom sees the bride, or a snapshot of the flower girl and ring bearer?

On Facebook, Garvey has leveraged this content to build an audience of potential customers. Garvey focuses on lush HD footage uploaded to Vimeo, and personalizes posts by mentioning the first names of the bride and groom. These short highlight reels will help her page continue to grow along with her business. Her engagement rate from 2015 to 2016, when she launched her business, was 109.8%. More recently, Garvey has focused on video content and photos  this strategy seems to be paying off. In May 2016 A Piece of the Party grew fast on Facebook, gaining 20 new fans in one day.

The graph above shows the sharp rise on May 16, when Garvey posted a feature highlighting her videos on a popular wedding site. By celebrating the feature with her followers, she is making early adopters part of her milestones. As with SlimCut media, sharing positive news about the company creates the biggest return for her new and growing audience.

**Climb Out of the Cubicle: Ecourses**
This brand delivers e-courses and organization tools to help you maximize your spare time, realizing your dreams around a 9 to 5. Founder Amber Monaco has created a second shift community on social media, where she organizes chats and shares her insights via blog posts. Social networks are drowning in self-help brands, from companies promising miracle cures in turmeric recipes to bloggers selling $800 conference tickets that promise to change your life. But the success of brands who promote content that only teases other products is often short-lived. Once social media users realize that value is never just one click away, they stop clicking. Customers have become wary of anyone peddling #lifehack solutions; building credibility and delivering real value up front is key to success in this area.

Climb Out of the Cubicle stands out with inspirational content available for free, in Monacos personable voice. Monaco has avoided the clickbait trap by frequently updating her Facebook page with blog posts that are self-contained stories, not behind a paywall.

The audience (and credibility) Monaco built on Twitter, along with her unique content strategy, allowed her to succeed on Facebook. Monacos steady growth on Facebook, where she posts her articles frequently, is a testament to the success of her strategy.

Another key factor in Monacos success? Posting as herself. As social media guru Brent Stirling said, new businesses can find success by posting as real people, so that users can identify with the person behind the brand. Monaco publishes in first person as the business owner, rather than in third person as the business, and this has been key to her success.

Starting at 0 in January, Monacos audience has grown on Facebook to almost 500 likes likes. That may seem small, but her engagement rate is high: an average of 147.5% since January. By giving away quality written content for free and not pushing other offerings hard in her posts, Monaco has avoided the spammy feel that turns off potential customers.

**Lessons for Small and New Businesses**
Slow and steady growth can be frustrating for small business owners growing their brands authentically by delivering real value on social media. Seeing just 5 new likes on a Facebook page or 10 new Twitter followers in a week seems, on its face, discouraging. But if you are growing authentically, those likes are valuable: they represent users who are genuinely interested in your content. 

New businesses do best when they recognize that their audiences are early adopters: users excited to share in the companys growth and be part of its important milestones. These fans and followers  the few, the enthusiastic  are more likely to become customers and then brand advocates. Another key feature is posting as the human behind the brand, not the brand itself. With engagement rates of more than 100% and a high proportion of shares and retweets, organic growth will likely continue for these new businesses.

When you start at 0, attracting 10 new likes or follows unlocks 10 potential new audiences: your brand is exposed to the networks of new fans genuinely interested in your content, and most likely to share it. Startups and small businesses that begin at 0 might grow slowly, but the early adopters who found real value in their brands will be more likely to convert. For new businesses, small gains are big victories. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did a few case studies on their social media campaigns.

Trump succeeds because he's sensationalist, and no matter what he says, he gets a high proportion of shares. This has allowed his follower base online to explode. 

Hillary always positioned herself as the anti-Trump, whereas Bernie positioned himself as the anti-Hillary -- I think that's why he didn't make it as the nominee. The core of  Hillary's campaign is that she can defeat Trump.

"Please RT! I #followback" - Don Draper, never

Is your agency more Lou Avery or Don Draper on social media?

Luring clients on social media is different than luring customers. Agencies should use social media to underline their ability to take risks that pay off, making brands trendy while protecting them from controversy. More amateur social media strategies  asking for RTs, jumping on every hot hashtag  dont cut it with clients who want to pay for risk-taking, innovative work. Hitching agency's social channels to trending hashtags, celebrities, or topics could attract more followers in the short term, at the risk of damaging your brand.

**How can agencies use social media to communicate innovation and safety for clients at the same time?**

**Pinch Social** of Toronto has articulated its expertness well on Twitter, positioning itself as an agency with the inside track on upcoming social innovations.

The agency's most popular tweets center on breaking social media news, as shown in the Crowdbabble table below. Rather than engaging in trending topics that could go awry, Pinch shares trending social media news. Change is neither good or bad, it simply is, Pinch seems to say on Twitter, its tone exuding calm and control.

Sharing news quickly emphasizes that Pinch Social is at the forefront of social media innovation, which has helped it brand itself as an authority in social marketing. Agencies can figure out what content is successful with their audiences using Crowdbabble analytics; Pinch succeeds when it's the first to share marketing news.

Pinch Social, like Don Draper, has what are called **"testable credentials."** Don's credentials included legendary creative power and foresight, credentials that clients were invited to test for themselves by meeting him in person and asking him to come up with campaigns on the spot. Testimonials? Unnecessary: Don was so confident in his abilities that he could make them credible by asking clients to test them for themselves. Come see for yourself, Don intoned. His ability to create campaigns on the spot created his credibility. 

Post-Mad Men, agencies make their claims credible by inviting everyone on the internet to test them for themselves  by looking at each agency's own social media channels, a new iteration of Don's catered boardroom meeting. 

Pinch Social's credibility is not certified by experts on social media, but can instead be verified by potential clients when they look at the agency's social feeds. Chip and Dan Heath, in their book Made to Stick, write that a testable credential is created when a brand outsources "its credibility to its customers", asking them to test it for themselves. Come see for yourself, agencies tell clients with their social media strategies. This is an incredibly powerful way to advertise credibility: by putting their social media strategies out in the open, on their own social accounts, agencies invite customers to see what they can do. 

**Public Inc**, another successful Toronto agency, has also carved out a niche identity on social by sharing news. Its most engaging posts focus on positive social news, involving local causes and non-profit groups. Its testable credentials are its credibility, but also its goodness.

The positive slant of Public's social voice makes it easy to retweet; #causemarketing also gives the brand trustworthiness. Like Pinch, Public uses Twitter to establish itself as an authority in social media marketing  an extremely hireable trait for clients.

As Peggy Olson once said, Id never recommend imitation as a strategy. Youll be second, which is very far from first. Bandwagon social media might work for clients, but agencies should steer clear of jumping on #hothashtags every time they come up. Trading trending topics for trending news, Public Inc and Pinch Social have both been able to advertise themselves on social as current and credible.

One of the first things a client will check when considering your agency is your social channels. Along with past campaigns, your own social is a great indicator of your approach to marketing and your ability to build an audience. Building your reputation as an authority in social media, in a unique voice, will impress potential clients.

When stuck between Lou Avery or Don Draper when it comes to social strategy, the middle road could be best. An agency's own social media channels are where its credentials  like credibility and inventiveness  will be tested by potential clients.

Before sharing content on social, ask yourself, "would Peggy Olson put her name on this?" Does this tweet live up to the credentials you advertise to clients? If your content is innovative and cutting-edge, without undermining your credibility, you've hit the sweet spot between safety and risk-taking. Tweet away! </TEXT>

In the age of #CustomNuptialHashtags, weddings are a bigger business than ever. As grooms and brides publish their weddings online, vendors are put on displayand into competition. The Most Liked Wedding contest is unofficially running 24/7 for all soon-to-be-married 20-somethings on social media. The bloodsport is a huge opportunity and challenge for brands in the wedding industry.

Could your organic naked sponge cake, artistically draped with sage brush, get #CraigAndStephanie4Ever more comments than their BFFs #SmithlyWeds2016? Will your bespoke hand-painted barn wood sign edge #ChrisandChrissie ahead on Facebook for the most liked album in their friend group? The answer might decide whether or not you get hired.

Welcome to the wedding thunderdome, where every like, favourite, and retweet counts.

Getting it right on social media is the key to a steady stream of clients for wedding vendors. There are more than 1,224 wedding photographers, 250 wedding makeup artists, and 400 planners in Ontario alone. How can vendors compete, when social media is awash with picture-perfect weddings?

**Define Your Brand**

Launching a social media campaign as a wedding vendor can be an intimidating process. How can you compete?

The hashtag #barnwedding returns more than 100,000 posts on Instagram. Mason jar centrepieces? There are millions of Pinterest pins. Perfect blushing bride makeup? Thousands of Facebook posts. How can you stand out?

Developing a successful wedding vendor business means constructing an original brand and voice that echoes in all the work you share on social. Staying generic (#barnwedding! #sunflare!) might work in the short term by appealing to everyone. But it also means that your posts will get lost online in the deluge of wedding content.

Fab Fete Event Planning, a Toronto company dedicated to "all things pretty", uses a very specific type of pretty to define its brand on Instagram. Almost every photo shared has a dose of pink or gold, but most aren't Pinterest-perfect staged pictures.

Fab Fete's high engagement is the engine for the account's follower growth (Fab's current following is 3,097), which extends the reach of its content and helps it find new customers. By tracking engagement rate and other metrics, vendors can find out what content is working and what isn't  which can help you narrow down your style and audience to define your unique voice. Successful brand development requires social media analytics.

Making your content more specific will narrow your audience right down to  potential leads. Your social media audience might be smaller, but engagementand conversionswill be much higher.

**Be a Person**

Weddings are about the love between two people (and how it can be photographed for Instagram).

Wedding content performs best when its posted in the voice of a real person. Vendors, after all, are real people who will be involved in an important day.

Integrating yourself into your social media posts is part of creating a memorable and approachable brand that appeals to people getting married. It's easy to hate high-maintenance brides, but your social media presence has to communicate that you're easy to work with.

Integrating yourself into your social media posts is part of creating a memorable and approachable brand that appeals to people getting married. It's easy to hate high-maintenance brides, but your social media presence has to communicate that you're easy to work with.

Lynzie's personality shines through in her visual style and captions on Instagram. By marketing herself as upbeat and carefree, she can sell couples on bringing her into their special day. Like Fab Fete, posts with her children shows customers making their own families that she shares their values.

Incorporating herself into her brand has kept engagement for @lovebylynzie high, with an average of 111 comments and likes each day.
Customers always factor in the person, not just the product, when choosing a wedding vendor. By tracking your social media performance with Crowdbabble, you can find out how much your audience responds to posts that feature you more heavily.

On social media, vendors have the opportunity to showcase their work and how awesome they are to work with. Doing both will turn social media leads into sales.

**Use Your Competitors**

Partnering with vendors in adjacent wedding categories can help you build your business. They might be competing for the same audience, but they can't steal your business if they provide different services.

Communities on social media are built, like scaffolding, over top one one another. You can use another vendor's audience on Instagram to build your own, and vice versa.
For example, wedding photographer swapping shoutouts with a cake vendor  one who matches their audience, brand, and voice  can be mutually beneficial.

For Love by Lynzie, likes and comments are the easiest to attract when she engages with other vendors. One of Love by Lynzie's most engaging Instagrams over the past month, the rainbow piata pictured above, captured a collaboration with four other brands. In the caption, Lynzie wrote: "On set today with @belairdirect @bemakeful and@blueantmedia teaching you how to make simple, summer fun projects for your next cottage party. I am in love with this rainbow piata we made!" By tagging collaborators in the description, Lynzie capitalized on their audiences  garnering more likes and comments.

What to do with direct competitors? After you've developed your brand, learning more about their strategies with social media analytics can help you get ahead.

First, you need to identify your direct competitors: these are vendors who are going after the same demographic of engaged lovebirds as you are and offering the same services.

Next, create a competitive report (see the blog post for step by step images). By adding their accounts to your analytics dashboard, you can learn from their successes and mistakes. With Crowdbabble, you can discover what your competitor's most engaging posts, hashtags, and filters are. This insider info will bolster your own social strategy with the knowledge of what their (soon to be your) audience loves.

**May the Odds Be In Your Favour**

With social media, wedding vendors  from florists to rented tuba players  are put on display in realtime as guests share images and videos. Weeks after the cake cutting has been Instagrammed, the vendor details are showcased online again as the photographer uploads an album to their website and professional pictures are re-shared.

The constant social sharing cycle for weddings is a huge opportunity for vendors, even though keeping up can be a challenge.

Leverage social media to find new customers by defining your brand, selling yourself, and tracking your competitors. With the plan outlined above, you can use this hyper-competitive arena to your advantage.

You need original content that people like to like or react to, stuff that adds real value. See what your competitors are doing, choose content themes, make a content calendar, and schedule your posts. 

I suggest using an analytics tool like Crowdbabble or Radian6 to see what your competitors' top posts are. Let's say that you're a brewery -- if you don't know where to start, it would help to load up the analytics for other breweries in the area who you want to emulate.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What are your competitors doing? Use a social media analytics tool to figure out their most successful posts for online (I like Crowdbabble), and for offline, do some snooping. 

What is your target market? 

The ideas below could work, depending on the above answers. 

**Partnerships and events**

Partner with other local small businesses that would be a good match. Buy a onesie at the baby store? Get a free coffee at the diner! Babies are exhausting. Buy a coffee at the diner? Get 10% off at the baby store. 

Cooking classes. Vegan, local, quick and easy, X ethnicity, Y heritage, etc. Really depends on the market and demographics. 

Family dinner night. Dinner at 5, then a classic movie on a big screen (not sure about movie rights). You'd have to be able to do the screen party pretty cheap to see a return. Just an idea! You could do food based on the themes of the movie. Goonie pie, Peter Pan popsicles, etc. Cinderella fairy godmother cookies. 

Any local tour groups? Partner with anyone bringing people into the area and become a stop on the tour. 

Local recipe contest. Have families / people submit family recipes then put the winner in the menu. Get people to submit recipes by having waitstaff tell them when they get their bills -- this is more customer loyalty than getting new customers. Post the ones that look decent on the blog. You could even do a Your Town family recipes book: it is super easy to format a book these days and do the print on demand option with Apple or CreateSpace. The return on this one might be smaller, so you'd only do it if you could 

Special events. Wine tasting night, coffee tasting morning, food "lecture series" but a lot more fun. 

Community support events. Provide free [insert cheap but good food here], and then invite people to use the space for free -- with 10% off drinks. Local theatre opening night parties, for example. People will hopefully order drinks once they're in the space. 

**Food as marketing**

Ice cream cart you can roll outside after lunch on the hot days. Pull a Sweet Jesus and do exciting (but cheap) toppings, like whipped cream or a bit piece of waffle cone.

Exciting new special that's EXTREMELY instagram-able. A spectacle, foodporn type deal that people might travel for. Something like this: https://www.facebook.com/SweetJesus4Life

Exciting, but cheap new menu items. "Exotic" tea flavours, fantastic jams (kitten and the bear, but cheaper, obviously), compost cookies, etc. Doesn't have to have expensive ingredients: http://milkbarstore.com/main/menu/

Try to give certain food items a little something extra without changing the flavours / textures that your customers love. Pies can be a little deeper, and have interesting tops (like hearts), you could give cakes a different look (see milkbar link above). Milkshakes can be served in a mason jar with a fun straw.

Easy value added. Serve hot milk or cream with coffee and tea, put the food on warm plates, etc. Try to stand out from the competition (again, without breaking the bank).

Since you focus on breakfast, maybe something like a tasting menu in addition to the regular menu? Fun new items?  $5 for 5 small coffee samples from around the world? You could buy small batches of beans from costa rica, indonesia, ginger coffee, etc and serve them in 5 little cups. Or something like 5 jams with a scone. Price it based on cost of getting all of that, obviously. Or something fun, like waffle tasting plate (5 varieties of waffle) or pancakes or bacon or whatever. 

Diner high tea. Could become a destination item. In the afternoons on Saturday and Sunday, offer a high tea with a diner twist. Make the little crust-less sandwiches, but instead of cucumber, do chorizo and egg. Instead of scones, do tiny hand-held pancakes and waffles. Serve on the usual three-tier thing. Little old ladies and teenage girls should eat that up. https://www.pinterest.com/pin/AbjttiEt16YQjmpJNV58ou24SBmZbkZFVQDh0MrhMer41mPpVxPbhVI/

Once your food is in shape and you've gotten customers to tweet / Instagram it, solicit local reviewers (even from out of town) for reviews. If you have your special / destination items in place, you'll give them a reason to review it. 

**Go local**

Look into your area's history and maybe come up with dishes that you can serve on landmark days. Name sandwiches over past town heroes or mayors. What's the dominant heritage in your town? Was it created by a bunch of German settlers, or ex-slaves? Maybe create a dish based on those roots.

What is the biggest job / career in your town? Something like 'firefighter's breakfast' or 'nurse's breakfast' with 'powerful fuel' to start the day would be awesome. This could even just be renaming something you already have.

Get really local with new dishes, as with the above ideas. Name things after intersections in your town, big events, whatever. Do not go generic. 

Getting into (or starting) a local foodscene. Local, organic, gluten-free, dairy-free, fancy juices, whatever -- there are a ton of food communities that you could market to or get into. "Crowdculture" marketing is huge on social media. 

A signature dish that makes you the best in the state / area. 

**Review ready**

Testimonials

Put yourself on all the lists. TripAdvisor, state restaurant listings, anywhere. 

Fresh coat of paint / new fonts are a good way to perk up a place on a small budget. Consistent branding is key: the website should look like the store sign should look like the menus. People need to go "oh, I know that place" when they walk past your store on the street, and want to go in.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Reaching users on Pinterest, the most conservative social network </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-08 21:12:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey marketers! I wrote a blog post about Pinterest, using Brexit and Trump as examples -- and Hillary Clinton as an example of how to reach Pinterest's conservative user base. Stats are from the Pew Research Center, which publishes detailed reports on social media usage.

Post with images: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/diy-politics-on-the-social-network-for-conservative-voters/

Just the post:

Surprised by the Brexit vote?

Conservative strongholds on social media are often invisible to the typical social media user. If you're a Millenial, your Facebook newsfeed may have suggested that a Remain majority was certain  or that a Trump presidency is unlikely. Social networks popular with young people can seem to confirm that older, more conservative voters arent on social, but that conclusion isnt based in fact: the echo-chamber of closed social networks like Facebook, where your audience is friends who agree with you, can just make it seem that way.

Where are right wing social media users, and how can they be reached?

Millenial overtures about the perils of isolationism on Twitter and Facebook are not being heard, because supporters of Leave and Trump are not on Twitter. Theyre not among your friends on Facebook. Conservative social media users have their own echo chambers, where they can post without fear of harsh criticism from their audiences of friends and family. For Brexit and Trump supporters, that echo chamber is Pinterest.

**The Heartland of Social Media**

Disenfranchised working-class social media users feel heard on Pinterest, a network largely bypassed by the elite that so many pins (user-generated posts posts) vilify. According to a 2015 Pew study, there are three times more women on Pinterest than menthe demographics are surprising, given the network's conservative, pro-Trump and pro-Brexit lean. 23% of black Internet users and 32% of Hispanic Internet users are on Pinterestit's less diverse than Instagram, but almost equal portions of black, Hispanic, and white Internet users have an account. Pinterest has a decidedly diverse and female user base.

The network that celebrates DIY home hacks has a decidedly libertarian streak in its most popular contentplus a healthy dose of nationalism.

Pro-Leave and pro-Trump boards often overlap. They're pinned by the same Pinterest users: the working class who seem to feel, judging by their pins, disenfranchised. The wealthiest Internet users are on other social platforms: 72% of Internet users who make more than $75,000 per year are on Facebook, while only 34% of that same wealthy demographic are on Pinterest, according to Pew's 2014 social media update. Similarly, 74% of Internet users with a college degree are on Facebook, while just 32% of the same demographic are on Pinterest.

Searching brexit on the social network returns both anti-Hillary and anti-EU pins. Strong sentiment about benefits being given to new immigrants (rather than, presumably, poor citizens) are linked to both Brexit and Trump pins. Xenophobia, and content about stricter boarders, are common on both Trump and Brexit boards.

Finding content positive about voting Hillary is almost as hard as finding content positive about voting Remain on Pinterest. Search queries that should return liberal-leaning pins return the opposite.

Pinterest users are less urban than the general population: 31% of Internet users who live in the suburbs and 31% who live in rural areas have a Pinterest account. On Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, those proportions are inverted: a higher percentage of urban Internet users are on the networks than the other demographic. Anger at elitism in government (and big cities) is common on Pinterest boards, as shown in the Brexit pins below.

**DIY Politics**

Even with an official Pinterest account, Hillary is the clear underdog candidate on the platform. She has just 8,900 Pinterest followers, compared to 7.28 million on Twitter and 1.4 million on Instagram. Pinterest users are not Hillary's demographic. Donald Trump and the Brexit campaign do not have official accounts on Pinterest: they don't need them. Pinterest users create and collect enough right-leaning content themselves, and they prefer it that way.  How can she, and other left-leaning causes and brands, reach Pinterest users?

The most popular (repinned) pins have a homemade aesthetic, which lends them authenticity. Unlike Hillarys and Remains slick agency-produced content, Brexit and Trump pins are clearly homemade: Comic Sans, pixelation, and other underproduced choices are frequent visual motifs.

Pinterest users are older; this might explain their disinterest in contemporary design trends. According to Pew,  37% of Pinterest users are 18 to 29, and 40% are over 50. Young people congregate on other networks. 53% of Internet users between 18 and 29 are on Instagram, and 87% are on Facebook.

The homemade feel doesnt undermine the pins, but rather legitimizes them to their older, suburban audiences. Brexit and Trump content on Pinterest is made by a a huge audience  of supporters, while Hillary and Remains pins were slickly produced by hired ad firms  by the much-despised elite often aligned with both. Brett and Trumps pins, in contrast, look like they were made by the people. The overproduced quality of Hillary and Remains content on the network might seem to be an asset: shouldnt social media content look good?

But in looking good, content also looks fakeat least on Pinterest, where DIY = authentic.

It may seem counter-intuitive, but what Hillary needs to prevent Brexit-like upheaval is thousands of pins that look like garbage, but were made by real supporters. Homemade pro-Hillary memes do well on Pinterest, and have thousands of repins. On Pinterest, liberal causes and brands can succeed by throwing out their visual playbooks and embracing Comic Sans.

**Mason Jars, Babies, and Halloween Costumes**

Clinton, and other left-leaning brands, do best when they rely on grassroots contentor create their own content in Pinterest's most popular categories. A pro-Hillary onesie, for example, is one of the candidate's most repinned pins: babies are a very popular content theme on Pinterest.

Pinterest boards and pins are divided into categories, which pinners can use to browse content. Hillary's board dedicated to her new granddaughter Charlotte is one of her best performing, tied with her Women Who Inspire board, with 7,200 followers. Nostalgia is another important content theme on Pinterest  consequently, Hillary's Memorable Moments board has the highest number of followers (7,400), even though it has only 6 pins.

DIY, recipes, and holidays are heavily trafficked categories on Pinterest: the domestic side of life dominates the social network.

Clinton succeeded on the conservative network when she took on a DIY Pinterest trend that might have been used against her: Hillary for Halloween.

Months in advance, Hillary is ready for one of Pinterest's most popular content themes: Halloween. Despite their professional, anti-DIY appearance, the pins already have dozens of repins each. They dominate search results for "Hillary Clinton halloween costume", which could have been unflattering to the candidate.

Donald Trump, who does not have an official Pinterest account, has not taken control of this content theme. As a result, his search results on the topic are far less flattering.

By using Pinterest's Halloween trend to her advantage, Clinton has shown how to control the conversation on Pinterest  even when you're the network's underdog. If Trump, or other conservative causes, wanted to extend reach on the platform, creating an official account and publishing content in Pinterest's most popular themes would be a good first step.

**Marketing in the Mason Jar Belt**

Right-leaning Pinterest users create boards filled with their grievances, from feeling unheard by governments to being left behind by austerity measures. But the user-base seems antithetical to the stereotypical image of the white, male Trump or Brexit supporter. Assumptions about what Pinterest's diverse and female user base wants undermine marketing efforts on the platform.

Social media marketers who want to drum up support for left-leaning brands or causes can learn from Hillary's strategy on Pinterest, and the mistakes of Remain's. Grassroots content and careful excursions into Pinterest's most popular content themes can extend reach on Pinterest, while visuals that succeed with urban social media users on other platforms fail. In the heartland of social media, Comic Sans and Donald Trump are popular because of their lack of popularity on "more liberal" platforms; the DIY politics of outsider candidates, causes, and brands dominate. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How to reach users on Pinterest, the most conservative social network </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-08 18:45:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey marketers! I wrote a blog post about Pinterest, using Brexit and Trump as examples -- and Hillary Clinton as an example of how to reach Pinterest's conservative user base. Stats are from the Pew Research Center, which publishes detailed reports on social media usage.

Just the post:

Surprised by the Brexit vote?

Conservative strongholds on social media are often invisible to the typical social media user. If you're a Millenial, your Facebook newsfeed may have suggested that a Remain majority was certain  or that a Trump presidency is unlikely. Social networks popular with young people can seem to confirm that older, more conservative voters arent on social, but that conclusion isnt based in fact: the echo-chamber of closed social networks like Facebook, where your audience is friends who agree with you, can just make it seem that way.

Where are right wing social media users, and how can they be reached?

Millenial overtures about the perils of isolationism on Twitter and Facebook are not being heard, because supporters of Leave and Trump are not on Twitter. Theyre not among your friends on Facebook. Conservative social media users have their own echo chambers, where they can post without fear of harsh criticism from their audiences of friends and family. For Brexit and Trump supporters, that echo chamber is Pinterest.

**The Heartland of Social Media**

Disenfranchised working-class social media users feel heard on Pinterest, a network largely bypassed by the elite that so many pins (user-generated posts posts) vilify. According to a 2015 Pew study, there are three times more women on Pinterest than menthe demographics are surprising, given the network's conservative, pro-Trump and pro-Brexit lean. 23% of black Internet users and 32% of Hispanic Internet users are on Pinterestit's less diverse than Instagram, but almost equal portions of black, Hispanic, and white Internet users have an account. Pinterest has a decidedly diverse and female user base.

The network that celebrates DIY home hacks has a decidedly libertarian streak in its most popular contentplus a healthy dose of nationalism.

Pro-Leave and pro-Trump boards often overlap. They're pinned by the same Pinterest users: the working class who seem to feel, judging by their pins, disenfranchised. The wealthiest Internet users are on other social platforms: 72% of Internet users who make more than $75,000 per year are on Facebook, while only 34% of that same wealthy demographic are on Pinterest, according to Pew's 2014 social media update. Similarly, 74% of Internet users with a college degree are on Facebook, while just 32% of the same demographic are on Pinterest.

Searching brexit on the social network returns both anti-Hillary and anti-EU pins. Strong sentiment about benefits being given to new immigrants (rather than, presumably, poor citizens) are linked to both Brexit and Trump pins. Xenophobia, and content about stricter boarders, are common on both Trump and Brexit boards.

Finding content positive about voting Hillary is almost as hard as finding content positive about voting Remain on Pinterest. Search queries that should return liberal-leaning pins return the opposite.

Pinterest users are less urban than the general population: 31% of Internet users who live in the suburbs and 31% who live in rural areas have a Pinterest account. On Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, those proportions are inverted: a higher percentage of urban Internet users are on the networks than the other demographic. Anger at elitism in government (and big cities) is common on Pinterest boards, as shown in the Brexit pins below.

**DIY Politics**

Even with an official Pinterest account, Hillary is the clear underdog candidate on the platform. She has just 8,900 Pinterest followers, compared to 7.28 million on Twitter and 1.4 million on Instagram. Pinterest users are not Hillary's demographic. Donald Trump and the Brexit campaign do not have official accounts on Pinterest: they don't need them. Pinterest users create and collect enough right-leaning content themselves, and they prefer it that way.  How can she, and other left-leaning causes and brands, reach Pinterest users?

The most popular (repinned) pins have a homemade aesthetic, which lends them authenticity. Unlike Hillarys and Remains slick agency-produced content, Brexit and Trump pins are clearly homemade: Comic Sans, pixelation, and other underproduced choices are frequent visual motifs.

Pinterest users are older; this might explain their disinterest in contemporary design trends. According to Pew,  37% of Pinterest users are 18 to 29, and 40% are over 50. Young people congregate on other networks. 53% of Internet users between 18 and 29 are on Instagram, and 87% are on Facebook.

The homemade feel doesnt undermine the pins, but rather legitimizes them to their older, suburban audiences. Brexit and Trump content on Pinterest is made by a a huge audience  of supporters, while Hillary and Remains pins were slickly produced by hired ad firms  by the much-despised elite often aligned with both. Brett and Trumps pins, in contrast, look like they were made by the people. The overproduced quality of Hillary and Remains content on the network might seem to be an asset: shouldnt social media content look good?

But in looking good, content also looks fakeat least on Pinterest, where DIY = authentic.

It may seem counter-intuitive, but what Hillary needs to prevent Brexit-like upheaval is thousands of pins that look like garbage, but were made by real supporters. Homemade pro-Hillary memes do well on Pinterest, and have thousands of repins. On Pinterest, liberal causes and brands can succeed by throwing out their visual playbooks and embracing Comic Sans.

**Mason Jars, Babies, and Halloween Costumes**

Clinton, and other left-leaning brands, do best when they rely on grassroots contentor create their own content in Pinterest's most popular categories. A pro-Hillary onesie, for example, is one of the candidate's most repinned pins: babies are a very popular content theme on Pinterest.

Pinterest boards and pins are divided into categories, which pinners can use to browse content. Hillary's board dedicated to her new granddaughter Charlotte is one of her best performing, tied with her Women Who Inspire board, with 7,200 followers. Nostalgia is another important content theme on Pinterest  consequently, Hillary's Memorable Moments board has the highest number of followers (7,400), even though it has only 6 pins.

DIY, recipes, and holidays are heavily trafficked categories on Pinterest: the domestic side of life dominates the social network.

Clinton succeeded on the conservative network when she took on a DIY Pinterest trend that might have been used against her: Hillary for Halloween.

Months in advance, Hillary is ready for one of Pinterest's most popular content themes: Halloween. Despite their professional, anti-DIY appearance, the pins already have dozens of repins each. They dominate search results for "Hillary Clinton halloween costume", which could have been unflattering to the candidate.

Donald Trump, who does not have an official Pinterest account, has not taken control of this content theme. As a result, his search results on the topic are far less flattering.

By using Pinterest's Halloween trend to her advantage, Clinton has shown how to control the conversation on Pinterest  even when you're the network's underdog. If Trump, or other conservative causes, wanted to extend reach on the platform, creating an official account and publishing content in Pinterest's most popular themes would be a good first step.

**Marketing in the Mason Jar Belt**

Right-leaning Pinterest users create boards filled with their grievances, from feeling unheard by governments to being left behind by austerity measures. But the user-base seems antithetical to the stereotypical image of the white, male Trump or Brexit supporter. Assumptions about what Pinterest's diverse and female user base wants undermine marketing efforts on the platform.

Social media marketers who want to drum up support for left-leaning brands or causes can learn from Hillary's strategy on Pinterest, and the mistakes of Remain's. Grassroots content and careful excursions into Pinterest's most popular content themes can extend reach on Pinterest, while visuals that succeed with urban social media users on other platforms fail. In the heartland of social media, Comic Sans and Donald Trump are popular because of their lack of popularity on "more liberal" platforms; the DIY politics of outsider candidates, causes, and brands dominate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly? The best thing for you to do right now is look at what your competitors are doing. Get a free trial of an analytics tool, load up their accounts, and see what their top posts are. What's working? What isn't?

From there, your biggest questions are:

 * **Who are your potential customers?** What are their demographics? What networks are they on? What devices do they use? What media do they watch? Make "user personas" or customer profiles. Maybe your company already has these. 
 * **How can you get to them?**
 * What is your company's current cost per conversion (turning a sales lead/prospect into a customer/sale)? AKA what's your budget?

From there, you're going to build a branding and content strategy. Then, you'll come up with an initial campaign and execute it -- with a content calendar, and social media scheduling tool. You'll then measure your performance (using social media analytics) and tweak as you go.

Suggested toolkit:

 * Hootsuite (to schedule posts)
 * Google calendar or even just a giant whiteboard calendar in your office (to help make your content calendar)
 * Crowdbabble or any analytics platform that lets you manage accounts for multiple platforms, and see into your competitors' statistics

Aside from the strategy side of things, there's the constant monitoring. That in itself requires a bit of strategy: how can you diffuse complaints from customers on social media, and take them private?

In terms of day to day duties, do some research. Google "social media manager" job postings and read them. </TEXT>

Online courses are awesome, but in terms of getting real projects done, the information is too compartmentalized for many. Online courses also have extremely high drop out/non-complete rates: odds are, if you start a codeacademy course, you're not going to finish it.

An in-person course will do three important things: a) access to an expert, b) you can meet people to do projects with, and c) you'll be much more likely to actually complete the course.

<TITLE> [RESOURCE] A case study on how four small businesses got their social media off the ground </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-20 03:10:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey, entrepreneurs! I looked at the social media strategies of four startups to try to find lessons for the rest of us. How do you build an audience when you're starting with 0 followers? 

Here's a link to the full article, with the images mentioned: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/starting-at-0-social-media-for-new-businesses/


**The Challenge**
Building a brand can be a challenge for small businesses on a shoestring budget. A creative approach to social media can have a huge impact,aat a very low cost. But when you start with zero followers, how can you build an audience?

Many small businesses turn to either buying likes on Facebook or furiously following and unfollowing people on Twitter and Instagram to inflate their audiences, somewhat artificially. This approach can damage your brand at the outset: inauthentic growth will make potential customers question your brands authenticity in other areas. If your online audience is fake, your brand promises, reviews, and value might be fake as well. I looked around the new brands in my own social network and the incubator where Crowdbabble is based to find examples of real growth: of users finding and following brands not just for a #followback, but because they find value in the brand and the content it shares.

The indie businesses below have successfully cleared the first hurdle of social media marketing: building a small, but real audience of fans online. How did they do it?

**Arti Designs Her Life: A Lifestyle Blog**
Arti Designs Her Life is an inspirational blog run by Arti Joshi, where she discusses her journey through the world of following your passions and who splits her time between London and far-flung locations like Australia and Indonesia. The blog launched in August 2015 and has experienced slow and steady growth to 500 WordPress followers and 110 very dedicated Facebook fans. On Facebook, Joshi has achieved what few other small businesses have: an almost equal proportion of shares to likes. Likes require less effort, and usually signal that fans are closer to the top of the funnel  less likely to convert. Because Facebook shares extend your reach to entirely new audiences (they push content onto your fans feeds for all of their friends to see), theyre much more powerful for increasing reach.

45% of fan engagement with Arti Designs Her Life on Facebook is shares. This indicates that her early adopter fans are brand advocates: though the page has a small audience, its very powerful. From March 2015 to March 2016, this highly engaged audience gave Joshis Facebook page an engagement rate of 152%.
Joshis ability to attract such a high proportion of shares might lie in her content strategy: her Facebook page is focused on videos with an inspirational lean.

When Joshi posted two interviews in quick succession, in early March, her Facebook Page Likes increased dramatically. By creating video content and interviewing with bloggers who have more Facebook fans, Arti engaged two active audiences: her own brand advocates, and those of her interviewees. With this approach, her Facebook fan base should continue to grow organically and she should be able to amass an even higher proportion of brand advocates.

**SlimCut Media: Tech Startup**
SlimCut Media is a Toronto-based startup that offers advertising solutions to online media, including news sites. Though its ad solutions boast more than 1 billion page views, translating those viewers into brand advocates on social media hasnt been easy. As a B2B startup, SlimCut faces a unique challenge on social media: its solutions arent aimed at most consumers and their audience is much narrower. On Twitter, SlimCut has successfully attracted followers interested in the companys progress. 

The companys most successful tweets arent about its industry, but about SlimCuts milestones as a startup. Photos and status updates, rather than industry news links, are the most engaging for @SlimCutMedias audience.

According to startup social media expert Brent Stirling, speaking as a person, rather than a faceless company, is the best way for new businesses to grow their audiences. SlimCuts focus on its progress as a team of people, rather than a company in a B2B industry, is aiding its follower growth.

**A Piece of the Party: Videography Company**
This new business delivers on the promise of fun in its name. Its CEO  London-based Lauren Garvey  has carefully built a trendy brand that delivers playful, authentic videos of important events. A Piece of the Partys brand is that its not your mothers wedding footage. Shareable content is built into the business model: who can resist footage of the first time the groom sees the bride, or a snapshot of the flower girl and ring bearer?

On Facebook, Garvey has leveraged this content to build an audience of potential customers. Garvey focuses on lush HD footage uploaded to Vimeo, and personalizes posts by mentioning the first names of the bride and groom. These short highlight reels will help her page continue to grow along with her business. Her engagement rate from 2015 to 2016, when she launched her business, was 109.8%. More recently, Garvey has focused on video content and photos  this strategy seems to be paying off. In May 2016 A Piece of the Party grew fast on Facebook, gaining 20 new fans in one day.

The graph above shows the sharp rise on May 16, when Garvey posted a feature highlighting her videos on a popular wedding site. By celebrating the feature with her followers, she is making early adopters part of her milestones. As with SlimCut media, sharing positive news about the company creates the biggest return for her new and growing audience.

**Climb Out of the Cubicle: Ecourses**
This brand delivers e-courses and organization tools to help you maximize your spare time, realizing your dreams around a 9 to 5. Founder Amber Monaco has created a second shift community on social media, where she organizes chats and shares her insights via blog posts. Social networks are drowning in self-help brands, from companies promising miracle cures in turmeric recipes to bloggers selling $800 conference tickets that promise to change your life. But the success of brands who promote content that only teases other products is often short-lived. Once social media users realize that value is never just one click away, they stop clicking. Customers have become wary of anyone peddling #lifehack solutions; building credibility and delivering real value up front is key to success in this area.

Climb Out of the Cubicle stands out with inspirational content available for free, in Monacos personable voice. Monaco has avoided the clickbait trap by frequently updating her Facebook page with blog posts that are self-contained stories, not behind a paywall.

The audience (and credibility) Monaco built on Twitter, along with her unique content strategy, allowed her to succeed on Facebook. Monacos steady growth on Facebook, where she posts her articles frequently, is a testament to the success of her strategy.

Another key factor in Monacos success? Posting as herself. As social media guru Brent Stirling said, new businesses can find success by posting as real people, so that users can identify with the person behind the brand. Monaco publishes in first person as the business owner, rather than in third person as the business, and this has been key to her success.

Starting at 0 in January, Monacos audience has grown on Facebook to almost 500 likes likes. That may seem small, but her engagement rate is high: an average of 147.5% since January. By giving away quality written content for free and not pushing other offerings hard in her posts, Monaco has avoided the spammy feel that turns off potential customers.

**Lessons for Small and New Businesses**
Slow and steady growth can be frustrating for small business owners growing their brands authentically by delivering real value on social media. Seeing just 5 new likes on a Facebook page or 10 new Twitter followers in a week seems, on its face, discouraging. But if you are growing authentically, those likes are valuable: they represent users who are genuinely interested in your content. 

New businesses do best when they recognize that their audiences are early adopters: users excited to share in the companys growth and be part of its important milestones. These fans and followers  the few, the enthusiastic  are more likely to become customers and then brand advocates. Another key feature is posting as the human behind the brand, not the brand itself: on social media, be a person. With engagement rates of more than 100% and a high proportion of shares and retweets, organic growth will likely continue for the four new businesses above because they follow those two rules.

When you start at 0, attracting 10 new likes or follows unlocks 10 potential new audiences: your brand is exposed to the networks of new fans genuinely interested in your content, and most likely to share it. Startups and small businesses that begin at 0 might grow slowly, but the early adopters who found real value in their brands will be more likely to convert. For new businesses, small gains are big victories. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Starting from 0: A case study of what four small businesses are doing right on social media </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey, entrepreneurs! I looked at the social media strategies of four startups to try to find lessons for the rest of us. How do you build an audience when you're starting with 0 followers? 

Here's a link to the full article, with the images mentioned: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/starting-at-0-social-media-for-new-businesses/


**The Challenge**
Building a brand can be a challenge for small businesses on a shoestring budget. A creative approach to social media can have a huge impact,aat a very low cost. But when you start with zero followers, how can you build an audience?

Many small businesses turn to either buying likes on Facebook or furiously following and unfollowing people on Twitter and Instagram to inflate their audiences, somewhat artificially. This approach can damage your brand at the outset: inauthentic growth will make potential customers question your brands authenticity in other areas. If your online audience is fake, your brand promises, reviews, and value might be fake as well. I looked around the new brands in my own social network and the incubator where Crowdbabble is based to find examples of real growth: of users finding and following brands not just for a #followback, but because they find value in the brand and the content it shares.

The small businesses below have successfully cleared the first hurdle of social media marketing: building a small, but real audience of fans online. How did they do it?

**Arti Designs Her Life: A Lifestyle Blog**
Arti Designs Her Life is an inspirational blog run by Arti Joshi, where she discusses her journey through the world of following your passions and who splits her time between London and far-flung locations like Australia and Indonesia. The blog launched in August 2015 and has experienced slow and steady growth to 500 WordPress followers and 110 very dedicated Facebook fans. On Facebook, Joshi has achieved what few other small businesses have: an almost equal proportion of shares to likes. Likes require less effort, and usually signal that fans are closer to the top of the funnel  less likely to convert. Because Facebook shares extend your reach to entirely new audiences (they push content onto your fans feeds for all of their friends to see), theyre much more powerful for increasing reach.

<TITLE> Turning Instagram influencers into brand advocates: start with the ones who already follow you </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-17 19:50:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys! I wrote a guide on how to find influencers within your own network and engage with them, using a new free analytics app for Hootsuite called Crowdbabble.  I know that "reach out to influencers" is a phrase most social media managers dread hearing, so I hope this can help.  

Article pasted below, but the images are here: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/who-are-your-most-influential-followers-on-instagram/

I used Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump as examples, but the suggestions still apply to actual influencers who would be in your network.

**Influencers In Your Network**

These influencers, because they follow you, are already interested in your content and brand.

To access the influencers in your network, log in to Hootsuite and add the Crowdbabble stream to your dashboard. Once youve logged in to the stream using your Instagram account, your influencers are ready for analysis. Most Influential Followers are listed in the Now view. This feature ranks all of your followers by the size of their own following and displays the top three.

These are the followers with the biggest audience on Instagram. Encouraging them to engage with and potentially regram your content would boost your impressions. As a bonus, these influencers are already engaged with your content: to encourage an even closer bond, you should engage with theirs. By clicking on the account name or photo, the influencers account will open in a new tab. Here, you can follow them back and engage with their content.

When you initiate engagement with influencers, you encourage them to reciprocate. This reciprocity builds a relationship that could turn your influential followers into brand advocates. With Crowdbabble for Hootsuite, you dont have to skim through your Instagram feeds for posts from your most influential followers  in some cases, you might not even be able to find their posts, because you dont follow them back.

Using the View Last Post from Most Influential tool, you can quickly find your influencers content and engage with it. Clicking the post will open it in Instagram, where you can engage with it.

Check the Last Post for content that you should like and comment on in order to engage with your influencers. Last Post refreshes any time your top three influencers post, and your Most Influential Followers refreshes anytime an influencer follows (or unfollows) you.

**Find Conversation Starters**

If you understand what topics and hashtags your influencers use the most, youll know what to include in your own content in order to reach them. Luckily, you dont have to study their feeds and ready every post to do figure out what your influencers want to talk about. Theres a better way: Crowdbabbles keyword and hashtag analytics.

In the Content tab of Crowdbabble's main application (www.crowdbabble.com/app/login), keyword analysis displays the words used the most in post descriptions in two ways: a bar chart and a word cloud. These keywords give you vital information about your influencers interests: you can see clearly what they like to post about the most, and what they visit Instagram to engage with.

Lets imagine that @BernieSanders follows you on Instagram and is one of your Most Influential Followers. In the example above, we can clearly see that his content centers around a few key themes:  workers, justice, and liberty. If you wanted to build your relationship with the influencer, you could focus on content and keywords with similar themes.

When you know their favourite topics and hashtags, its easy to create content that connects with them.

**Find Your Influencers Favourite Hashtags**

You can also engage with your influencers by using their favourite hashtags. The second graph in the Hashtag tab on Crowdbabbles main app tells you which hashtags your influencer has used the most. Like the keyword analysis, Post by Hashtag indicates the influencers favourite topics to post about on Instagram  as well as their tone and even their posting locations.

Donald Trumps favourite hashtags on Instagram include: #trumptrain, #trump2016, and #makeamericagreatagain. If @realDonaldTrump was one of your Most Influential Followers on Instagram, you would have a higher chance of catching his attention and initiating a conversation if you used those hashtags.

Knowing the favourite hashtags and keywords of your influencers will keep them interested in your content and encourage them to engage with your brand. Youre more likely to succeed in connecting with your influencers when you personalize your approach. Meeting them on their own turf  topics and hashtags that they care about  ups your chances of turning them into brand advocates.

THE END. I hope that helps! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys!
I'm promoting a play that's a mashup of Little Women and Girls. The play has won a bunch of awards and tickets are selling well, but that's not reflected on our Twitter. We decided to go with an satirical approach: tweeting in character from the perspectives of the four March sisters. The goal is to build an audience of people who grew up reading Little Women and now watch Girls.
Have any of you run satirical or in-character accounts? Many of the tactics I'd use on a more 'standard' account don't apply so much here. I will be participating in a few Twitter chats in character, but any other feedback is welcome. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey everyone! I interviewed Brent Stirling of the Ryerson DMZ (voted best incubator in North America) and thought you guys might value some of his thoughts. 

The biggest one is keeping your startup people-focused on social media, and not trying to appear to be a global company right away. The entrepreneur him/herself should be a big part of the content -- rather than a brand tweeting as a person-less entity. Being a faceless global corporation will make it much harder for you to get new followers on social, even though it gives you a certain amount of credibility.

Here are the highlights:

Katie: How do you help startups develop a social media strategy thats personable and engaging?

Brent: With most of them it all comes down to, you know, a Venn diagram when youre coming up with content with them. Your content themes are back to your target segment and [they] achieve a goal, but you pick those three kind of circles that kind of make sense for you. If youre a social media analytics company, youre probably talking about social media, analytics, and where youre at: a hyperlocal side to it. Again, **people want to identify with a personality and startups have this ability to showcase their personality behind their brand. Because they dont have a legal team or an HR team, it makes it easier to identify with founders and cofounders.** If you take a picture of your two cofounders and say, were out there pitching these people, generally the crowd tends to get behind you.

The major pitfall that startups fall into is that theyre either in stealth mode, where they dont like to talk about thought leadership or anything, or they dont like to put themselves as the brand. They want to be a global brand immediately. But that runs counter to everything that social is now. Everyone wants to want to back the underdog, they want to back the local team. Showcasing that and building from there builds a really good success story that should be highlighted throughout your social.

Katie: Recently, Harvard Business Review published an article about marketing in the age of social media, about how content marketing is going downhill but engaging in what the author calls crowdcultures is becoming more important. What do you think about that idea?

Brent: I essentially agree. This is why I love working in startup culture: its easier to create a brand personality, and its harder for bigger brands to engage on social  and the HBR article talks about how there are specific personalities like pewdiepie that are doing really well.

Katie: As opposed to Coca-Cola.

Brent: Coca-Cola is a large, faceless corporation. If you look at the overarching trends as to who does well on social, its the Taco Bells and the Old Spices, where they pick a specific person that will be their spokesperson. The idea that you change your actors for each commercial is dying, and everybody wants to I always say that it doesnt matter if its B2B or B2C, its all P2P: its person to person. If you look at Taco Bells Snapchat, its the same people every day. So you start to engage with their personalities overall, as opposed to this idea that this overarching brand exists.

Even with the DMZ, a lot of the stuff that we do I try to insert myself in it, so that people can identify with the person behind the brand, as opposed to just, this is the DMZ brand. And you kind of have to make it personable.

Thats why Taco Bell does so well on Twitter, because it sounds like a person, because it sounds like a person is talking  as opposed to a marketing machine that is churning out the next big tweet. As soon as you start to automate things like that, there was a bot recently that taught

Katie: Microsoft.

Brent: Yeah. There was a bot recently that was taught all of this hate, because they were trying to automate online conversation. **Online conversation is just an extension of what were doing right now.** Unless youre like this online, then generally youre going to tend to lose. </TEXT>

The biggest one is keeping your brand people-focused, and not trying to appear to be a global company right away. The entrepreneur him/herself should be a big part of the content -- rather than a brand tweeting as a person-less entity.

<TITLE> What did you guys think of the HBR article, "Marketing in the Age of Social Media?" Article posits that content marketing is dead, and crowdculture will replace it </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-19 18:46:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> "While promoters insist that branded content is a hot new thing, it's actualy a relic of the mass media age that has been repackaged as a digital concept [...] It turns out that brands have little interest in the content that brands churn out."

The author, Douglas Holt, cites a bunch of examples of massive spends on content marketing that have gone nowhere: Coca Cola is the big example. 

The solution offered: "While the rise of crowdculture diminishes the impact of branded content and sponsorships, it has greased the wheels for an alternative approach that I call cultural branding. The dramatic breakthrough of the fast-casual Mexican food chain Chipotle from 2011 to 2013 (before recent outbreaks of foodborne illness) demonstrates the power of this approach. Chipotle took advantage of an enormous cultural opportunity created when the once-marginal movements that had challenged Americas dominant industrial food culture became a force to be reckoned with on social media. The chain jumped into the fray as a champion of this crowdcultures ideology. By applying cultural branding, Chipotle became one of Americas most compelling and talked-about brands (though recent food-safety difficulties have dented its image)."

I found his lack of interaction with the whole #PoorLeo fandom very interesting. His nonparticipation didn't really dampen anyone's enthusiasm and the entire meme was a massive marketing boom for the actor.

What do you guys think?

Below is the text: 

**Becoming Meme**

Its hard to find a less pitiable man on earth than Leonardo DiCaprio. The actor and environmentalist has achieved stratospheric levels of success. Hes often photographed poolside. And that pool is usually on a yacht.

In the world of film, hes famed director Martin Scorseses favourite leading man and has won awards for his environmentalism and acting. DiCaprio has picked up three Golden Globes, two Critics Choice Awards, and one Scream Award. He even holds two Blockbuster Entertainment Awards: a testament to his long tenure in show business.

Until this year, DiCaprio seemed to have everything but an Oscar.

What did winning an Academy Award do to Leonardo DiCaprio online, and why did the Internet care so much?

The characters DiCaprio played in the early 2010s were often victims of injustice. Young social media users found parallels between DiCaprio and his characters: theyre both unfairly deprived some key ingredient (a family, professional recognition, some sitting room on a giant piece of wood floating in a freezing ocean).

In 2014, when DiCaprio was nominated for his role in The Wolf of Wall Street, the meme reached a fever pitch on Tumblr. More than 180,000 users supported a Tumblr post seething with (mock?) frustration. DiCaprio had been nominated for an Oscar four times, but had never one. On Tumblr, this injustice was too much to bear.

Fuelled by the often-unfortunate characters he portrays, Poor Leo became a popular hashtag on Tumblr with thousands of posts.

Reddit was soon to follow. Posts with DiCaprio in the headline have racked up more than 100,000 upvotes (I stopped counting after the first of many pages of submitted DiCaprio links and text posts).

Still, the actors Twitter account didnt receive much engagement. Leonardo DiCaprio the brand was not as engaging as Leonardo DiCaprio the meme. Between Oscars 2015 and 2016, engagement for the star remained low at 2.3%.

**Poor Leo Goes Viral**

Before Oscars 2016, DiCaprio had what every movie star('s publicity team) dreams of: an engaged, young, and massive following online. Every year, Poor Leo memes grew in popularity. The Poor Leo meme became a sort of Mayan doomsday clock ticking down to the next Oscars. During the show, win or lose, the hundreds of thousands of Tumblr-ers, Redditors, and aggregator readers would react in a huge way.

Every year that Poor Leo lost the meme continued with higher (and funnier) stakes than ever before. In the extremely unlikely event that DiCaprio won, the meme would implode in on itself like a dying star, creating a black hole threatening to break all of social media and do what to the meme himself?

**@LeoDiCaprio Finally Benefits**

For the official @LeoDiCaprio on Twitter, excitement over his long-awaited Oscar translated into a concrete and dramatic spike in engagement. The Crowdbabble graph below shows engagement  likes, comments, and retweets  before and after the show. Can you spot his tweet about his Oscar win?

The giant engagement spike is the response to @LeoDiCaprios post-win message to fans. His tweet about winning attracted 367,729 engagements from more than 100,000 Twitter users within three days. At the time of press, two weeks later, engagement had snowballed.

Engagement with the tweet is now up to 955,465 retweets and likes. Fandom for Poor Leo the meme, it seems, does translate into fandom for Leonardo DiCaprio the actor. The Oscar-winning actor, though, does not participate in conversations on Twitter  even after his win, he was often left out. Mentions of @LeoDiCaprio stayed surprisingly low after his win. Just 20 to 60 tweets per day mentioned @LeoDiCaprio and, as shown above, the account never responded. Perhaps sensing that the actor doesnt tweet himself, Twitter users talked around and about him  they didnt try to include @LeoDiCaprio in the Poor Leo/Validated Leo conversation.

The low number of mentions shows that the meme still operates independently of his official brand. The high engagement for his tweets, however, indicates that his official account was able to capture the enthusiasm generated by the Poor Leo meme. The actor didnt lose a huge number of users between the grassroots fandom and his official account  no small feat for a big movie brand. To compare, Brie Larsons post-win message on her official social account (Instagram) attracted 88,757 likes and comments. Thats fewer than 10% of DiCaprios 1m retweets and likes.

**After the Win, What Now?**

Leonardo DiCaprio has what no other Hollywood actor does: a very special relationship with the Internet. But the little golden statue that solidified Leonardo DiCaprios status as a bankable, talented A-List actor may have also killed his covetable online fandom. Now that DiCaprio has his Oscar, the running Poor Leo joke is over. The thrill is gone: each Oscar run from now on will have much lower stakes. Subsequent awards seasons are unlikely to generate the thousands of meme posts and comments on Tumblr and Reddit that they did before the win.

Between February 28 and March 3 2016, in the wake of his win and almost-1,000,000 engagements, @LeoDiCaprio gained 179,500 new followers on Twitter.

But engagement with DiCaprios account, from March 3 to March 7, is back down to 0%.

Perhaps DiCaprios massive Poor Leo fandom will find a new way to celebrate Validated Leo. The thousands of social media users who enjoyed the Poor Leo meme might wait in suspense each awards season to see if the win becomes a streak. Maybe the actor will begin choosing roles that do not end with unjust horror in candlelit crypts or creepy mental hospitals  characters who get what they want (the dawn of a new Strutting Leo era on screen). Maybe Reddit and Tumblr users will find some other void in DiCaprios life to fixate on, and Poor Leo will re-emerge.

How can Leo take advantage of this big social media following -- particularly on Reddit and Tumblr -- now that #PoorLeo is over? How can he market himself now? </TEXT>

Maybe Reddit and Tumblr users will find some other void in DiCaprios life to fixate on, and Poor Leo will re-emerge.

How can Leo take advantage of this big social media following -- particularly on Reddit and Tumblr -- now that #PoorLeo is over? Thoughts? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hashtag Analytics 101: Which hashtags should you use, and what are their audiences? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-23 15:00:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys! I wrote a guide to hashtags to encourage social media managers to think outside the #tag #everything box. I tried to represent this in a pyramid visualization, showing how audience size changes when you use different hashtags. 

Here's a link to the full piece: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/hashtag-analytics-101-find-new-followers/

Hashtags can help you find new followers on Twitter and Instagram by connecting your posts to new audiences. Which hashtags should you use to boost your following and find your next brand advocates?

**The Largest Audience: Trending #Hashtags**

 * Risk level: High
 * Reward: Exposure and impressions for your content
 * Audience: General, skewing younger and more engaged
 * Examples: #wastehistime2016 #kony2012 #iloveBAEbut #bettercallsaul

Trending hashtags  including jokes (#wastehistime2016) and breaking news events  have the biggest audience on Twitter and Instagram. If you find one that matches your brands voice on social media, this type promises the most exposure. Trending hashtags will expose your brand to users at the top of the sales funnel: a general audience that might not buy into your brand, but could give you a boost by following you.

Lets imagine that your brand is a bike shop hoping to attract new followers on Instagram. Youve snapped a picture of someone untangling their bike outside your store. A lighthearted trending hashtag could yield a high number of impressions for the post.

You might get buried in the pandemonium. But theres the slim, tempting possibility that your content becomes the favourite and goes viral.

Brand usage of trending hashtags can go very wrong. DiGiornos appropriation of #whyIstayed nearly cost the brand its Twitter following. Its almost always a bad idea for brands to jump on breaking news or sensitive trending topics, unless theyre directly related to the event (unlike Crocs and #DavidBowie).

Jokes and lighthearted entertainment topics, around album releases or music and movie events, tend to be much safer and more rewarding for brands. Trending hashtags should match a brands voice. But when theyre used with others, even lighthearted hashtags that arent an exact match could boost engagement.

**Drilling Down: General Topic Hashtags**

 * Risk level: Medium
 * Reward: Reaching potential customers
 * Audience: Narrowed to region or interest
 * Examples: #cycling #nyc #thesix #justmomthings #fitness

As your hashtags audiences shrink, they become more likely to engage with your brand. Mentions per minute are lower than trending topics, so your content is less likely to get completely buried. 

This post is getting long, so I won't include the explanations for expression hashtags and active community hashtags. You can check out the full piece for those (expression or slang hashtags help you target specific age groups, while active community hashtags are the most targeted and help you find followers closest to the bottom of the sales funnel). 

**Stacking Hashtag Types to Maximize Reach**

How can you make the most of your hashtags?

A combination of hashtags  selecting just one for each audience  will maximize reach without alienating the people most likely to follow you. Plus, you'll #avoid #seeming #spammy. For example: "When you lock your bike to someone else's #wastehistime2016 #icant #biking #biketo" hits different audience sizes without any conflicts or repeats between hashtags.

Choosing a theme and then finding one hashtag from each audience size is a good way to maximize potential impressions. At the same time, you can still connect with customers most likely to buy into your brand.

By combining trending, general topic, expression, and active community hashtags, you will have reached out to a general audience, a specific interest and age range, and a niche community. Layered together, you'll connect with all four audiences while potentially reaching out to your next dedicated customer: the young cyclist from Toronto, for example, who uses every hashtag you've included. You've hyper-targeted your content to the smallest, most niche audience: but it will also be given exposure to the audiences for each type. Win-win. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-01-14 20:52:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys! Wrote another crisis management case study, this time on Starbucks' #RaceTogether campaign. It was launched to "start the conversation" about race in stores and on Instagram, and it did not go so well for  the brand.

Full link with data vis here, summary below: https://medium.com/@crowdbabble/crisis-management-101-did-the-good-intentions-behind-starbucks-racetogether-pay-off-d39ffc6ece70#.ax8aj3zcz

**Jumping Into the Race Debate**

RaceTogether was planned as a nation-wide campaign to unfold in stores and on social media from March 17 to 22 2015. The goal? Starting the conversation about racial tensions in America. The effort? Massive.

 RaceTogether was launched on March 17 with an Instagram hashtag via @StarbucksPartners, followed by more than 76,000 Starbucks staff members and fans. Starbucks did not share the risky campaign on its main @Starbucks account. Common was brought on to support the effort; the endorsement Instagram was one of @StarbucksPartners top posts for the week.

**Outrage**

Black Lives Matter gathered outside the Union Square cafe in New York, one of Starbucks hallmark locations, to voice their outrage at the corporate hijacking of a complex problem. Attacks from such a prominent activist group stamped #RaceTogether as politically incorrect, on the wrong side of the issue.

Protests flowed from the streets to the web as the #RaceTogether hashtag was overtaken by critics on Instagram.

Engagement with @StarbucksPartners declined as the hashtag spiralled out of the brands control.

During the initiative, @StarbucksParnters received an average of 1,281 likes per post, down from the 2015 average of 1,827 likes per post.

The campaign began with protests and ended on March 22 angry opinion pieces from Rolling Stone, Fast Company, and others. On the last day of #RaceTogether, Gawker leaked an internal memo from Starbucks with instructions to its baristas from its launch. Headline? Heres the Internal Memo from Starbucks Disastrous Race-Relations Push.

**Effects**

RaceTogether certainly started conversations, but not the kind Starbucks hoped for. Discussion centred on the embattled brand, not race relations. Replies to @StarbucksPartners posts dipped and #RaceTogether posts were the accounts least popular. An initiative meant to deepen discussion had the opposite effect on social media.

During #RaceTogether, @StarbucksPartners received just 30.7 comments per post, less than half the 2015 average.

As demonstrated by the IBM #HackaHairdryer debacle, social media users treat failed campaigns like contagions dangerous to the health of their own social capital. @StarbucksPartners and #RaceTogether became the Typhoid Mary of Instagram: no followers wanted to go anywhere near it.

Fear might take hold internally as well: Starbucks could become wary of undertaking other social good initiatives. The failed campaign could cramp Starbucks willingness to take risks, which would hinder innovation and its ability to grow  plus, the public could lose out on risky initiatives that actually work.

In his December 2014 letter to Starbucks staff, Howard Schultz said staying silent is not who we are. #RaceTogether might have succeeded if it had been allowed to blossom organically from the companys internal efforts  its tuition reimbursement program for low-income students and training programs for unemployed youth, among others. Forcing the transition into a public campaign doomed it from the beginning: there were no obvious benefits for customers or society, so it failed as a social good initiative.

@StarbucksPartners has revived and weekly engagement has now exceeded its 2015 average. 

The failed campaign in March didnt dampen enthusiasm for Starbucks red cups  the big spike in November  or the general uptick over the holiday season. With is brand damaged offline, but its social media engagement bouncing back, #RaceTogether hasnt been fatal for Starbucks.

**Discussion**

What do you guys think about social good initiatives as marketing? Can companies take on controversial issues and succeed? Did Starbucks #RaceTogether campaign succeed, if the goal was starting conversations?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Lessons from the viral sensations of 2015, and the importance of feel-bad-then-feel-good stories </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-11 06:38:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi marketers! I did a case study of viral sensations in 2015. I was amazed at how similar three of the viral star's stories were -- Tim Tai, Ahmed Mohamed, and Sean O'Brien (dancing man) all had the same story arc. I think marketers can learn a lot from them.

Link to full piece over in dataisbeautiful: https://np.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/40f4l9/what_happens_when_you_accidentally_become_famous/

**Intro**

Feel good, especially feel-bad-then-feel-good, stories dominated social media in 2015.

The feel-bad-first stories have the same arc: Ahmed Mohamed was taken to jail for building a clock; Tim Tai was shut out of a protest; and Sean OBrien was mocked for shimmying in public. All three were excluded in real life and then radically included on social media, going viral as a result. For Jim Cantore, the definition of a feel good story, excitement about thundersnow proved contagious.

And then there are oddball outliers, like Emo Kylo Ren  heir to the viral throne of @DepressedDarth.

Do people who go viral for different reasons go viral in the same way? Will any of the 2015 viral sensations last, or are their fifteen minutes of fame collectively over?

**Lessons for Marketers**

Following and retweeting Ahmed, Sean, and Tim was a satisfying way for Twitter users jump on the right side of a hot button issue and showcase themselves doing it. The heartwarming nature of the turn of events for the three sensations  from cruel to overwhelmingly positive  drew in users, if only briefly.

Now, all three are experiencing a decline in followers. On average, every week Ahmed loses 1,026 followers, Sean loses 500 followers, and Tim loses 44 followers. The three cannot recreate the moments that made them famous: their exclusion and subsequent floods of support online by their nature can really only be one-offs.

Can anyone go viral in the same way? If liking you can make people feel part of something that says faith in humanity restored, the answer is yes. The feeling of satisfaction that comes from rushing to the rescue of a person wronged is likely what drove people to follow Sean, Ahmed, and Tim on Twitter. Giving social media users the opportunity to feel like upstanding human beings  when its as easy for them as a trackpad tap  is obviously a key ingredient in virality. Have you guys tried this as a marketing strategy, ever? 

Not everyones viral fame is fading fast: Jim Cantore gains an average of 923.75 followers each week. Emo Kylo Ren is growing exponentially, with 124,002 new followers last week alone. 

Perhaps Jim and Kylo are staying viral because they are able to continue delivering the thing that made them viral in the first place. Jims excited weather videos and Kylos sardonic jokes, like Alex from Targets candid snaps, made them famous and are keeping them famous. </TEXT>

**Disaster 1: Blackberry**

When you think of social media, you might not think of Blackberry, partly because of a gaffe earlier this year. The tech giant was slow to integrate touch screens and cameras, putting itself behind other mobile devices in ease of use for Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. And whats the point of a smartphone if you cant use it to talk to your friends?

Even RIM employees find tweeting with a Blackberry next to impossible. Or, thats the message the company very publicly sent when they tweeted about their integration with Twitter using an iPhone. Whoops.

**Disaster 2: Cloroxs Emoji Racism**

Terrible things happen when brands embroil themselves American racial tensions, whether inadvertently or on purpose. When Apple released a more diverse set of emoji on April 8, Clorox responded with a tweet interpreted as a call for emoji genocide: "new emojis are great but wheres the bleach".

After realizing that the attempt at humour failed miserably, the grovelling began.

**Disaster 3: Bics Think Like a Man**

International Womens Day. A time to celebrate women, or a time to sell stuff? Bic chose to celebrate women by sharing an inspirational quote on its South Africa Facebook page. If only that quote were actually inspirational.

It read: Look like a girl, act like a lady, think like a man, work like a boss. Ruh roh. 

After the pens for women debacle, the brand was on thin ice with the girl/lady sex. Telling women to look like girls and think like men (the best of both worlds?) did not go over well. Bic quickly posted an apology on its Facebook page. Apologizing quickly and sincerely is a good strategy, but it had one major pitfall for Bic: users were still angry. Overall, stories created per post declined for the brands Facebook page as women turned away from the brand.

Bic South Africa also posted less as their stories created continued to dwindle. Who would want their friends to catch them liking Bic, which branded itself as outdated and sexist with the womens day post?

**Disaster 4: Houston Rockets Dead Horse**

Heckling the fans of an opposing team is pretty common in the stadium, but it doesnt play as well on Twitter. During a heated game, the Houston Rockets tweeted a horse emoji being shot at the Dallas Mavericks (mascot: horse). As demonstrated by Clorox fiasco, people take emoji jokes very seriously. Tweets criticizing the emoji threat poured in, forcing the teams social media team to apologize.

Some deemed the Rockets apology unnecessary  the joke didnt touch on any hot button issues or target specific groups  but its sincerity, apparently, was appreciated. After April 29, engagement soared. May was a great month, but the brand shifted strategies in June when it ousted the manager responsible for the dead horse tweet. Favourites, retweets, replies, and mentions flatlined.

**Disaster 5: Starbucks Race Together**

In March 2015, Starbucks decided to jump into the debate on race in the US. It attached Race Together stickers to cups, launched a #RaceTogether hashtag, and handed out questionnaires asking customers how many black friends they had. What could go wrong?

Instagram followers had a few problems with the initiative from @StarbucksPartners. The company was jumping into something totally unrelated to its brand, and its lack of diversity in some locations seemed to make the chain a poor choice for the debate.Some critics noted how tightly coffee and the history of slavery were intertwined. The Race Together campaign read as a tone deaf PR campaign exploiting racial tensions to sell coffee.
Despite the criticism, Starbucks didnt back down.

Can a big brand participate in a conversation about a sensitive topic like race? Starbucks Partners account has enjoyed consistently high engagement on Instagram in 2015 at an average of 1,713 likes or comments from users per day, but its average went down to 1,613 from April to August after the campaign. As with the other 2015 blunders, followers stepped away from the brand on social media.

**Disaster 6: SeaWorlds #AskSeaWorld**

Since the documentary Blackfish was widely distributed on Netflix, SeaWorld has had a rough time. In March  was their a collective gas leak for social media teams in spring 2015?  the company opened itself up to complaints with an #AskSeaWorld hashtag.

The crisis might have taught SeaWorld to stay quiet, but the brand didnt apologize. An apology without a change in its policies would have likely sparked more outraged, as Bic experienced on Facebook.
Instead, after #AskSeaWorld, the brand has used Twitter to fight allegations stemming from Blackfish, gaining retweets along with angry comments. After Harry Styles called out @SeaWorld for its conditions, the companys response attracted 4,932 retweets and 5,516 favourites, more than @SeaWorlds monthly average. Its follower growth has been steady, indicating that as Blackfish and the #AskSeaWorld bungle fades, theres some hope that the deluge of irate comments might let up.

Full case study here: https://medium.com/@crowdbabble/going-viral-what-star-wars-did-to-its-new-stars-on-social-media-4507183fe20d#.moqghnnos

**Before the Premiere**

Before the premiere, Daisys Instagram account had reached 200,000 followers and Boyega had attracted 226,000 followers on Twitter. Judging Boyegas account by its size, however, can be misleading; John had an anemic .1 replies per tweet. Boyegas pre-premiere engagement was low relative to his large following.

Daisy, an amateur Instagrammer, fared far better than Boyega before the premiere at an average of 571 comments per post to Johns .1 Twitter replies. Ridley also pulled ahead on Facebook. In December, her Facebook page had a 72% engagement rate (15,072 likes, comments, or shares per post) to Johns 56% rate (7,573 engagements per post).

**After the Premiere**

There was a huge awakening for the stars after the premiere and they felt it on social media. As shown in the visualization below, created in Crowdbabble, Daisy Ridleys engagement spiked on Instagram after opening night (see link).

After the premiere, engagement soared for Boyega: he now attracts .5 replies per tweet and 38% of his posts are shared more than 100 times, up from 30%. Boyega engaged with his social media following with a fun video of him surprising fans, which he tweeted and shared on Facebook. It became his most-liked tweet and Facebook post ever.

Boyega and Ridleys candid posts  like the poorly lit, handheld smartphone video above  are their most successful. The polished movie-star mask? Boyega and Ridleys followers say they dont need it.

Social media is strongest with Ridley: her Instagram following outpaces Boyegas on Twitter by 617,000. The two stars are still learners, but its clear that theyre beginning to master Twitter and Instagram. 

**Facebook Fails**

Growth on Facebook was much slower. In December  when fans were willing to like everything they posted  Ridley and Boyega shared just 10 and 12 updates respectively. As shown below, in a graph made using Crowdbabble, Ridley didnt share anything on her public Facebook page in the critical days after the premiere (see link).

Similarly, Boyega shared nothing on Facebook for six days post-premiere. Thats not how social media works! Ridley and Boyega now boast about 310,000 and 146,000 Facebook likes respectively, but for stars in the biggest movie of all time, the numbers could be higher. The first order of business the week after the premiere should have been to post every day on all platforms, to turn the hype into a lasting following.

**Conclusion**

Ridley and Boyega  and the franchise as a whole  were only partially successful on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. On social media, there is no try: engagement suffers when posts are infrequent and half-hearted. This seems to be a lesson that the dark side (like Emo Kylo Ren, @KyloR3n) has learned, but the light side has not. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all! Impressions are a very important metric for social media marketers, so I thought I'd post the definition below. Impressions are the broadest measure of engagement on Facebook. 

Definition: Impressions is the total number of times activity related to your Page is seen by people on Facebook, whether they see it organically, virally or via a paid advertisement.

**Impressions vs Reach**

Impressions and Reach (People Reached) are related but slightly different.

Lets say somebody on Facebook sees your post three times in their news feed during the day. You have basically received 3 impressions on your post, but the reach is just 1 person.

Reach measures unique people. Impressions does not measure unique people, but rather the total number of times your activity is seen.

**The 3 Components of Impressions**

Impressions can be broken down into the following 3 components:

**Organic Impressions:** The number of times people saw activity related to your Page directly from your Page.

**Paid Impressions:** The number of times people saw activity related to your Page via a paid Facebook ad.

**Viral Impressions:** The number of times people saw activity related to your Page via a story published by a friend. For instance, if someone likes, comments or shares something on your page, their friends might see a story about your page virally.

<TEXT> Hope you're all well. This is a query I've gotten a few times offline, so I thought I'd post here for your feedback.

Has anyone here succeeded in monetizing a Twitter feed/high number of impressions by running contests for people? Is there a third-party service that can help set this up, or do you chase down brands individually? 

Thank you! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Content marketing, Hootsuite, and Buffer for your small business: a short primer </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-17 22:57:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Social media can take up way too much time for entrepreneurs, if they're not careful. Careful scheduled posting can help you focus on your core business and not get bogged down sharing content on different platforms. Below, a primer on two services: 


**Hootsuite**
The Hootsuite platform is a versatile service to help with social posting. Hootsuite is a dashboard that aims to make it easier to engage, publish (with schedules), provide analytics, create social media marketing campaigns, and overall social media channel management. Hootsuite has built in integrations across the platform. The platform typically caters to marketers who use Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn,Google+, Foursquare, MySpace, WordPress, TrendSpottr and Mixi.

One of the best features of Hootsuite is scheduled publishing. You can schedule a whole assortment of posts to take place automatically. It may require a few hours setting everything up, but during peak business hours, small business owners would have little to worry about when both content is being posted during business hours while the business is open, giving small business owners the attention to their customers both online and off. Hootsuite is a freemium service but has a premium plan for $10 a month.

**Buffer**
Butter is a dedicated social sharing platform. Buffers main feature is scheduled posts across all your social media channels. If your only issue is not having the time or remembering to post social content on a daily basis, Buffer might be your solution. Buffer has integrations across Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.

We recommend using Buffer once a week to schedule your weekly posts. You can still post on all your social media when you are in the moment but Buffer is a great way to manage a social media campaign requiring multiple posts over a period of time.

Prices for individuals go as high as $10 per month and businesses can look at spending $50-$200 a month. A free trial option is available.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all! I thought the three definitions below might be useful. Once you've formed a social strategy as a small business, you'll be confronted with a lot of service options to make it happen. It helps to understand the three different categories of service, so you know what each option can do for you (Hootsuite vs Iconosquare vs Radian6, for example).

**Social Listening** is how you monitor your digital channels (customers, competitors, products) and come up with a strategy that can potentially influence new and existing customers. Services like Mention are a great way to listen about what people are saying about your business, products, related opinions, the market and your local economy.

**Social Posting** is the act of posting content and updates about your business. This may also include replying to other users who interact with you over social media. Social media services often have apps directly available on the phone to help you post relevant and recent content. However, services like Hootsuite and Buffer allow you to post content that can be shared at a later time, allowing you to strategically plan (and execute) your content over the campaign.

**Social Analytics** is the raw data and insights about your social media. Services like Crowdbabble mine this data for you to provide you an in-depth analysis of your brand on social media, how your customers are engagement with your content and the growth of your followers.

<TITLE> Crisis Management 101: What can we learn from IBM's #HackAHairdryer Twitter fail? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-14 19:51:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> IBM recently had an epic social media fail: trying to attract women to tech with a #HackAHairdryer hashtag on Twitter, calling for submissions to a hairdryer-themed (FOR WOMEN) hackathon. This did not go over well. 

**Impact on IBM:**

In the month before the crisis, IBM averaged 147.7 favourites, replies, or retweets per tweet. According to Crowdbabble, engagement was low at just 5.8% (a fraction of 263,606 followers engaged with IBMs tweets). Below, a visualization of total favourites, retweets, replies, and mentions from November 5 to December 5 2015.

For the first ten days of December for the year prior, the statistics are similar: 3.2 tweets per day, with 88.5 engagements per tweet. @IBM was growing, albeit slowly.

Then, #HackAHairdryer happened and things got hairy for the brand. On December 6, engagement went through the floor.

Engagement rose the next day as people reacted to IBMs apology. For the first half of December, #HackaHairdryer pulled the engagement rate down to 2.3%  even more dire than the previous average of 5.8%.

The #HackAHairdryer discussion on Twitter detached from IBMs handle, perhaps mercifully, as women in tech used it to vent all grievances relating to misogyny in tech. This negative attention grew exponentially when a much larger group  everyone who did not want to be viewed as anti-women  jumped on board to condemn the campaign and distance themselves from the brand.
Mentions of @IBM were low before the campaign but have stayed uncharacteristically low since the fatal tweet.

**How Not To Be IBM:**

On social media, intent is irrelevant. IBMs effort towards being woman-friendly did not come through in the execution (or conception, or any part) of #HackAHairdryer. What IBM was trying to do didnt matter. The companys lets just paint it pink approach revealed hair-raising misperceptions about women that were more deeply rooted than its hot air about including them. 

Twitter users rush to condemn offensive tweets, so as to not appear to condone them. If criticizing a brand becomes an Im not terrible bandwagon on social media, the brand should act as quickly as IBM did to destroy all the evidence (tweet, website) and apologize. Online, erasing the evidence is impossible, but it has become shorthand for a sincere apology and admittance of wrongdoing.

Brands should check their campaigns for crisis potential before launch by asking: what could prevent our target group from participating? Is there a downside for them? Those simple questions could have helped IBM see that #HackAHairdryer was not a campaign, but a clever trap for both women and the brand. #HackAHairdryer not only sullied the companys reputation as a smart innovator, but made it impossible for women to participate without casting themselves as trifling girly-girls.

**Full article:** https://medium.com/@crowdbabble/crisis-management-101-ibm-s-hackahairdryer-overheats-db3e190f39fe#.c0rl5ydgt

TL;DR: Do some social media research and ask yourself if there's a downside of a campaign for your followers before launch. And, maybe run the campaign by some of the people it's targeted at before sharing it with your big Twitter user base.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys! Thank you for your positive response to my last post, Facebook Analytics 101: Like Sources. I'm glad that was useful. 

Today, I thought I'd post about how to calculate your Facebook page's virality. This relies on understanding the people are talking about metric (not to be confused with stories created), as well as people reached. I found a basic equation that seems pretty accurate for figuring out how viral your page is, which is a very useful metric to track (for yourself and higher ups, if you're a social media manager).

Lets say that yesterday 500 people saw activity related to your Facebook Page, and 25 of these people created a new story. Then:

**PTAT = 25**

**People Reached = 500**

**Virality of your Page = 25/500 = 5%**

Out of all the people who saw activity about your Page (whether it was in the news feed, as a paid Ad or anywhere else), 5% of these people extended the reach of your Page to their friends by creating a new story.

Therefore, the Virality of your Page yesterday was 5%.

Tracking your virality will help you better assess what works and what doesn't on your page. Here's the full post: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/facebook-analytics-101-page-virality/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> Measuring Facebook page likes isn't the only thing page managers should be doing to boost their reach on the platform. To figure out how to increase your page likes, you have to know where they came from. How do you guys track your Like sources? Do you use a specific analytics platform, or do you dig into the API yourself? 

I've tried to make an exhaustive list. Here's all the different like sources you can isolate for your pages using the Facebook API: 

 * **page_suggestion** People who liked your Page through an invite from an admin
 * **timeline** People who liked your Page from the Likes section of their own Timeline or someone else's
 * **ads**	People who clicked 'Like' in an Ad or Sponsored Story pointing to your Page
 * **registration**	People you added to your Page as admins
 * **mobile**	People who liked your Page from a mobile device
 * **wizard-suggestion**	People who liked your Page in the New User Wizard when registering for Facebook
 * **profile-connect**	People who liked your Page on the Page itself or in a News Feed or ticker story
 * **external-connect**	People who liked your Page from an external site using a Facebook social plugin
 * **recommended-pages**	People who liked your Page from a Recommended Pages unit on the right column of Facebook
 * **favourites**	Other Pages that have liked your Page
 * **api**	People who liked your Page through an app developed by a third party
 * **page-browser**	People who liked your Page using Facebook's Page Browser
 * **hovercard**	People who liked your Page from the popup window they get when they hover over a link that leads to your Page
 * **search**	People who liked your Page from their search results
 * **page-profile**	People who liked your Page on the Page itself
 * **ticker**	People who liked your Page from a story they saw about it in ticker
 * **like-story**	People who liked your Page from a story they saw about a friend liking it

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm doing a series of case studies on viral sensations, to see what marketers can learn from them. Below is my analysis of the #alexfromtarget phenomenon -- from the week the teen went viral, to his social media strategy now. I was surprised by the platforms that were currently succeeding for Alex, given that a photo made him famous.


Last November, when teen Twitter set its eyes on Target cashier Alex Lee, the attention could have flickered out almost immediately. Now, with more than 3.9 million followers on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram combined, Alex has stretched his 15 minutes into a very big year. How did Alex from Target go viral? And how did he turn his 15 minutes into a lucrative, long-lasting, and massive following? We used Crowdbabbles social media analytics tools to find out.


Alex was an unlikely viral sensationor might have been considered an unlikely subject for fame before social media. The teenager, whom Gawker described as a babyfaced angel, joined Twitter in September 2014. He used the platform to joke with his friends, complain about his parents, and mostly retweet anything fleek.

Crowdbabbles engagement analysis tells us that before he went viral, Alex tweeted around twice per day and receiving two to three favourites, retweets, or replies per tweet. Then, on November 2, a teen snapped a picture of Alex working at a Target checkout counter in Texas and uploaded it to Twitter (caption: YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO).

On Twitter, thousands of tweets about the unassuming cashier flooded @AlexLeeWorld (then @ac163). It was the Twitter equivalent of thousands of preteens and young women screaming for their favourite singer at a concertno tickets required.
As the viral sensation unfolded online, teens gleefully mashed up images of Alex with other phenomenons to create new memes: #alexfromtarget + The Fault In Our Stars spawned new viral tweets, including i fell in love with the way he bagged my groceries slowly then all at once #alexfromtarget. Alex Lee was the prom king of Twitter.

When #alexfromtarget became a trending topic, news outlets picked up the story and @alexleeworld gained 300,000 new followers overnight. Like student photojournalist Tim Tai, Alexs virality touched the zeitgeist. Alex from Target became a public figure news outlets could use to discuss Internet fame and teen social media habits.

<TEXT> Hi, innovators! I thought I'd start a discussion around innovation at large companies, as opposed to start ups or R D-focused organizations. I think that staying innovative as a larger business can be a lot harder than if you're solo or part of a small team. 

Does anyone here struggle to keep their department or work innovative within a larger bureaucracy? What helps you foster innovation in that environment? 

I just finished editing a new book called Reinventing Dell, which is focused on how company culture can impact innovation. It's a good case study of how the capacity to create disruptive innovations died at Dell as it grew, and is now slowly being rebuilt.

<TITLE> Have you ever been asked to create "viral" content? I did a case study of a Twitter user who actually went viral organically, with the goal of finding lessons that marketers can learn from. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-19 15:53:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This month, I've started a series on social media analytics for accounts that go viral that will hopefully provide some lessons for brands. I looked at Tim Tai, the student photojournalist who became at the center of a national news story, and what happened to him on Twitter as a result. I wanted to answer the question: What does a real viral sensation look like? How does it unfold? What can content marketers learn from a real example? 

On November 7th of this year, Tim Tai was turned away from a protest at University of Missouri and a video captured the incident. Before the video was uploaded, Tim was gaining speed on Twitter as he complained about losing his rights as a member of the press and got dozens of retweets from other journalists. When the video was uploaded to YouTube and shared on Twitter, Tim gained thousands of followers overnight.

Basically, Tim did not attempt to capitalize on or take advantage of his newfound spotlight -- and this only drew more followers to him. On Twitter he fully supported how other journalists viewed him, as an unbiased reporter wrongfully turned away from a protest. 

You guys can read the full story here -- I try to break down how he went viral: https://medium.com/@crowdbabble/going-viral-how-did-tim-tai-s-twitter-account-actually-blow-up-6a17c9276a12#.3dtequpcz

<TEXT> Hi all -- I'm getting in touch about Reinventing Dell, which apparently has great lessons for new and growing businesses. The synopsis says it turns Dell, which was created in a dorm room, into a parable of sorts about what can go wrong as you grow. IE the growth you want so badly can kill your business if you don't manage it properly.

Have any of you entrepreneurs here read it? I'd love to chat about it. I'm on Goodreads and it's gotten on to a bunch of my favourite lists there, but so far no discussions have started.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Audi's failed approach to content marketing: why did Facebook fans turn away from a series that spotlighted drivers instead of cars? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-12 18:03:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This month, I've been investigating the long-term repercussions on social media and content marketing fails for brands with a series of case studies. My latest piece is on Audi's #PaidMyDues campaign, a video series that spotlighted drivers rather than cars. It was a content marketing effort with little short films made about different drivers. Everyone hated it -- the harshest reaction was on Instagram and Facebook.

You can check out the case study here: https://medium.com/@crowdbabble/crisis-management-101-when-doing-something-different-backfires-efda5bd1dce7

It seems that since Audi had a tried-and-true approach (car-focused posts that always did well), it could fall back to that after the crisis and continue to grow without many repercussions. Without that stream of content guaranteed to do well, the brand really would have floundered.

For me, the #PaidMyDues campaign could only happen because Audi had already found a set of content (the car posts) that worked so well, that would get a consistent stream of engagement. Basically, when brands have found content that works, that's when they have the freedom to abandon that approach and do something different. When they're already failing, experimentation is the most dangerous. Do you guys agree? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This month, I've been investigating the long-term repercussions on social media fails for brands with a series of case studies.

<TEXT> Hi guys! I'm researching social media crisis strategies this month, and have come across a variety. The most interesting, to me, is when a brand chooses to do nothing. Absolutely nothing. 

Telecomm and tech companies, I've found, use the 'no comment' approach if users already use their social media channels for tech support or just to complain.

Do you guys find that your Facebook and Twitter page are being co-opted as customer service helplines? If so, what industry are you in? 

Here's a summary of how Bell Mobility was affected by a fake review scandal, which was publicized on social media: https://medium.com/@crowdbabble/crisis-management-101-did-writing-fake-reviews-help-or-hurt-bell-mobility-202bea441201

Basically, the company did nothing even though ti was found guilty of faking product reviews. Employees had written the reviews and a journalist sniffed them out. Bell was subsequently fined $1.25 million by the Canadian Business Bureau. Do you guys agree with the silent strategy they employed? Have you ever written any fake reviews?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Last year, Bell Mobility was caught writing fake reviews for one of its apps. Turns out that having employees pose as real customers is illegal in Canada and the company has since been fined $1.25 million.

Scott Stratten broke the story and shared it on Twitter. It was picked up by the CBC and went viral on social media. I looked into Bell's analytics to see how its brands were affected: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/crisis-management-101-did-writing-fake-reviews-help-or-hurt-bell-mobility/

I was very surprised to see how it affected them on Facebook and Twitter. Their strategy for dealing with the scandal on the two platforms was also interesting -- they ignored it completely.

<TEXT> Up until last week, I had no way of tracking how users shared my content beyond the first step on social media. I could track clicks on links from Twitter and Facebook, but if a user shared a link and that new link generated new traffic (for example), I had no way of capturing that pathway. If I shared the new Star Wars trailer on Facebook, I could track the traffic that generated. If someone I knew texted or tweeted or Facebooked that link to a friend and the friend clicked on it, I would have no way of tracking that traffic.

I've figured out a method for how to do that here, but it's a bit complicated: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/the-dark-side-how-to-use-google-analytics-to-measure-and-estimate-your-social-media-roi-by-leveraging-dark-social-activity/

Do you guys use specific tools to capture interactions on social media beyond the first one? What do you do with the info once you find it?

I'm wondering if there's a more streamlined way than the one I've come up with.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey there! Many of you probably already know how to do this, but I recently came across a blog post with the code for embedding a hidden Pinterest image. http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/boost-traffic-by-hiding-pinterest-ready-images-in-your-site/

Many very successful bloggers do this, like Dale Partridge. All of his images are 100% width, fitting the look of his site, and he hides the narrow Pinterest-ready images so that only those with a Pin It button can see them. Clever. 

Since Pinterest drives more web traffic than Twitter and Reddit, I thought this was a useful hack for bloggers.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys! My site is trying to attract a demographic that's a good fit on Pinterest, so we just figured out this trick for embedding hidden images in blog posts that do well on Pinterest. Before we started doing this, when you clicked on the "Pin it" browser button (most often used by pinners), a sad selection came up. 

I kept noticing all of these Dale Partridge blog posts pop up on the Pinterest popular feed. You've probably seen these posts - total clickbait - sharp images with stylish fonts, and headlines like: "How I made 25 million before I turned 30" and "4 signs you're meant to change the world." 

These images don't actually appear on any of Partridge's posts, though. When you click through to his content marketing, they don't show. He keeps the design integrity of his site and hides code for his Pinterest-ready images (narrow, tall) in the site's back end. Here's the code snippet you have to embed: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/boost-traffic-by-hiding-pinterest-ready-images-in-your-site/

Since Pinterest apparently drives more traffic than Twitter, this is a good trick to learn if you cater to suburban/rural women or women with families.  </TEXT>

  Hopefully the survey results will be a good resource and point of comparison for the small businesses here. Please fill it out if you have a second!

Do you guys see a clear ROI for social media? Did you invest in a social media manager, or are you doing it yourself?  </TEXT>
