<TEXT> I didn't mind voiced protagonist in Fallout 4, witcher games (altought in those I didn't play my own character, more book-Geralt) and Dragon Age Inquisition. I don't think it limited my roleplay but I would prefer silent protagonist. 

And if Bethesda insists on making protagonist voiced, *please* don't take one "Default_white_male_1" and "Default_white_female_1" voices and be done with it. Either give us at least 3 different kind of voice options *or* different voice for each race. So our pompous altmer mage from summerset islands, our backwoods barbarian orc and lived-his-whole-life-in-ashstorms dunmer don't *all sound exactly the same* </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the short stories starts with words along the lines "as usual, cats and children were ones to first notice him coming " as children were scared of him. I think he looks more like Witcher in the first 2 books because he is doing witchers work and thus regulary uses elixirs while in the main saga he doesn't use them that much which would explain why he doesn't look so noticeable. In the first book it is said that the elixirs is what make witchers look pale and corpse-like </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't really find a translated version anywhere so my question is, as a not native english speaker how hard it would be to understand the english in the book? I recently read LOTR in english and there were few expressions and things I had bit hard time understanding and it made reading it bit slow. I have no problem reading newer books in english.

I get that it was written in 1859  I'd imagine the english is very old? Can someone who speaks english as a second/third language maby share their experience with this particular book or other books by Charles Dickens? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've never smoked cigarettes but I do smoke (small) Al Capone sweet cognac cigars now and then. First time I tried it it felt unnatural and pretty bad. But after my brother taught me how to smoke it right I actually like it (it was not peer pressure). I never got addicted to it or started smoking but now I smoke maby pack (10 cigars) or maby two a month whenever I'm out. I might take a few months break not smoking and then when I go to a bar grab a pack.

It's easy to get hooked or cheat yourself saying "I only smoke socially". So be careful on staying only on the 1. But it is possible to smoke now and then and not get addicted on it too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd say they are. They aren't the best books ever written. They are fairly short and the first book starts kinda slowly. But there is alot of interesting things if you enjoy elder scrolls lore and I really enjoyed the characters. 

But then again, they aren't the best books ever so the plot can be bit predictable and like the top comment said, they aren't too memorable.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's smooth, oaky, slightly smokey but not too much and suprisingly fruity (first time I tried I was suprised how well I could taste pear in it) and the best part is that it costs under 20. Great if you want to try out a single-malt but don't want to use alot of money. 

Another nice one is Talisker 10 year old but I find Dawhinnie be smoother so it's better for people who don't have much experience with whiskey. Depends on if you want smoky scotch, in which you should get Talisker IMO.

Feel free to add something if you agree or disagree </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even thought I don't agree with him, I can see why the games bother him. People who come from the games see cdprojekts vision of the world first, then Sapkowskis and these two are pretty different. I read the books first and then played the games and I can say that the game world felt very different and it affected on how I enjoyed the games. And Sapowski said that he thinks cdprojekt didn't capture the feel of the world he had in mind.

Especially since I've seen people online complaining on how the books aren't consistent with the game because they think that the books were some kind of prequel written for the games. Or complaining on how different characters of Geralt and Dandelion are. Or how Geralt has a relationship with Yennefer instead of Triss. (I have seen all these complaints made about the books, many of them in this subreddit)

Before you go trashing him, saying that he is pathetic or idiot or a fucking dumbass, remember that this is his life's work. Even though he completely agreed to cdprojekt making the games and has no right to be complaining about them, it must hurt seeing world **he created,** his life's work, being shown incorrectly and getting praise, while the fans who don't bother reading the books and the original, his vision on the witcher world. 

And while **I don't agree with him**. I can see his point and how the games could hurt the experience of the person reading the books after playing the games. So try to see this from his point of view. 

EDIT: Also, for those saying that the games are what made it popular, no, they did not. This books series was reall popular in several countries before the games. For example in Poland and Russia. And if the books were translated before the games were made, I'd say they would have been popular in many other countries too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really jump around depending on my mood: 

Witcher 3 when I want to be sucked into the world and enjoy great story

Skyrim when I want to roleplay a character of my own making

Elder Scrolls online when I want to play with other people

Doom multiplayer when I feel like playing adrenaline pumped mindless shooter

Fallout 4/nv when I feel like playing a shooter but not feeling like playing a multiplayer

These games (except doom) are the ones I *really* get into time to time. Sometimes I might stop playing one for a week or two but then I come back when my mood changes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's good game to play solo, but there isn't much RP in the G. Questing is lots of fun, magic classes are great and powerfull and there is justice system so you can spend time stealing stuff or assassinating npc's. But the quest decisions doesn't really have any real consequences (some have who lives, who dies types of things). But they are alot of fun and alot better than in most mmo's. Also the voiceacting is suberb.

In summary: It's good mmo to play solo but if you are looking for meaningful and complicated story like in singleplayer rpg's, you might want to look at singleplayers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been around plenty of cats and short of a cat meowing and looking at a tin of food this is the extent of a conversation that I have had with a cat.

Funny story about that, one of my moms cats is basicly a mute. He can't really meow, so he communicates by purring and making this kinda funny growling sound. And the other cats rarely meow (unless they want something) but he often "growls" when just playing around. Also some use their paws to kinda get attention like waving and pointing around. But one thing I love about dogs is that they do communicate better than cats. 

My dogs get progressively more frustrated when I don't do what they are asking me to do. You can hear it in their voice and in the way they behave.

My parents dog does that too, but I've noticed that cats can hold crudges longer than dogs. For example one of our cats with long hair had to go get her fur trimmed because there was alot of knots with things like needles from trees and such after she was hunting in forest after rain (my parents live in country and the cats run free outside) and week after my mom had taken her for vet to be trimmed, she left the room everytime my mom went in and gave her some evil looks. 

It's fun to talk to people about these things because everyones pets are so unique and different in their nature. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My evidence is my own experience. Have you ever had a dog being mad at you? I havent. But I sure as hell have had cat mad at me. Our family has had dogs and cats and dogs are very empathic like you said but cats can basicly give you silent treatment if you happened to buy the wrong kind of food for them. They also know when something is wrong with you same way as dogs. I think dogs just get more attached to humans than most cats.

This is purely based on my experience with these two animals. Is it right or wrong? That I can't say. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You shouldn't feel bad for copyright striking them if they don't stop using your footage. You are a content creator, you make living off it. If someone else steals it and it has effect on your work and income, you should take action. 

I know it might feel kinda weird since most of youtube community has very negative view on copyright striking, but in situations like this you need to remember you are a creator first, part of youtube community second. It should not be allowed to let other people steal your content.

Or at least this is my two cents on the matter. I hope this gets resolved in peacefull way and the people have enough respect for you to stop using the footage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cat's are funny like that. Some show alot of affection and some don't. When our familys cat got cancer, the last week for him he *never* left my moms side. And I mean never. If she went to the bathroom, our cat would scream outside the door if she didn't let him inside. The cat also slept every night with her and got pretty anxious when she was at work. 

My parents have one cat that always when I come to visit, the cat comes rub his head against my feet and hands the moment I sit on couch. While another cat runs away from me (until I start eating, then we are best friends). Cats have really unique personalities, even more so than dogs </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm kinda thinking that the manor owner could be quilty. I mean he owns a bigass manor so he might also own some land. You know, fields here and there... Also why did he call the cops when his dog was playing with a sock. Dogs dig up all kinds of weird shit and he didn't know that Trish was gagged when she was raped so I why did he think it would be relevant? I don't know, maby too far fetched.

I just know it's not Leo or Aaron or the ex-husband. They are too obvious canditates. Way too shady fucks. And I think they are doing something else, running a drug ring or something but I kinda doubt its them (unless they all did it). It's gonna be someone on the side, kinda like on season one. Someone who has no obvious connection. 

Also Chloe is the best Latimer hands down </TEXT>

You won't be able to pull off 20k+ dps until you get more cp and better gear, but find a build you like and start using the rotation asap so once you have the required cp and gear, you are already comfortable with the rotation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pc's can do *so much more* than just gaming. 3D modeling, graphic design, music production, programming, photo/video editing etc. Not only are these fun things to do but some can even help you in real life. For example your job place needs a flyer for something? Just whip out some free graphic software or your adobe creative suite and suprise the people you work with! Pursue new hobbies like photography! Or maby even pursue new career on new field.

Also you can see if you can find some game that you enjoy. What types of games did you used to play? You might try out some online games and try to make new friends who enjoy gaming.

If you end up selling it I would say sell the tower in one piece, and then the monitor(s) separetly. That way you might make it even, or at least not too big lost. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For those who don't know, Ciri has similiar encounter in the books with a con artist trying to pass off a wyvern (or a forktail?) as a basilisk. That was pretty good scene in the book and I really liked when I walked past this spot and noticed that guy calling that wyvern a basilisk.

Hats off to CDPR again. As a someone who really likes the books, things like this are very nice to see in this game.

<TEXT> I prefered Witchers combat to Skyrims. Mostly because on higher difficulties on Witcher you actually could play it more strategically using proper signs, oils, potions and dodging and altering between heavy and light attacks. 

While in Skyrim on Legendary difficulty you fight the enemies just the same way, except enemies have tons of health and hit harder. Mage? You backup and throw spells. Warrior? Bash, hit, block, bash, hit, repeat. Thief? One shot everything from distance with bow or sneak up and one shot them with 2 daggers that oneshot everything. 

But I must say I *love* both games. They both are great games that I play depending on what I want to play.  </TEXT>

It's a joke about the main character is monsterslayer and huge ladies man. Not so much on the books that the games are based on but in the first game there are tons of women who you can sleep with. There are also opportunities to sleep with monsters (succubies, nymph) in the games IIRC. There is also scene in Witcher 3 where Geralt and other Witchers talk about banging a succubus 

EDIT: *Also* it is signed "Dandelion" who is a bard and Geralts best friend and always making jokes about him. Especially in the books </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lockpicking is similiar to Oblivion  (but better) and there are lots of locked chests in the world and also you can break into peoples houses and lockboxes merchants and guilds have. I like breaking into those lockboxes because you need to time it right so that you don't get caught and get bounty.

Pickpocketing is very simple. You sneak behind npc and you have % chance of pickpocketing random item. For example low class npc's (simple fishermen, beggars, etc.) have higher chance of pickpocketing them but they have worse items than higher class people like nobles. There is also a brief time window when you are sneaking behind a npc when your chance goes up 20%. The chance can be increased with passive skills.

I think the justice system is lot of fun, I sometimes spend hours sneaking in towns pickpocketing people and breaking into lockboxes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sauron was a Maiar spirit called Mairon. Maiar are spirits that descended into middle-earth to help Valar (the "gods") to shape the world. Mairon was one of the most powerfull Maia before he was corrupted. He was learning the ways of forging to become great craftsman under study of Aul the Smith. The Dark Lord Morgoth corrupted him into Sauron and he left the Blessed Realms and stayed on middle-earth. 

Why I'm telling you this is that you need to understand that he was not a being of middle-earth, so his powers were many. For example the Maiar could change their form freely instead of having fixed form. Other Maiar in Middle-Earth were the *Istari*, or the Five Wizards. Saurons powers could be compared to the other Maiar on Middle-Earth, Sauron, Radagast and Gandalf for example. But ofc all had their own powers apart from power of Maiar. For example Gandalf was especially skilled in sorcery related to fire because he had the Ring of Power Narya in his possession that he received from Cirdan the Shipwright and Saruman had powers to persuate others to do his will. Saurons sorcery was darker. Also he was skilled in combat and smithing powerfull weapons.

The reason he lost the ring was basicly that he got cocky. After the Last Alliance of Elves and Men had beaten Saurons armies and laid siege on Barad-dr for seven years, he came down to face Elendil and Gil-Galad in duel. But after he had defeated both of them Isildur, son of Elendil, step up and took his fathers sword and cut off the ring from Saurons finger. His physical body was destroyed because nearly all his power was stored in the ring. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, the ring of power doesn't work like that. It doesn't give Sauron some kind of forcefield that protects him. The ring enhanced Sauron own power as a Maia but since he didn't have any kind of force field already, the ring didn't give that to him. The main goal when forging The One Ring was exercise control over the other Rings of Power forged by Celebrimbor. 

When forging The One Ring, Sauron concentrated part of his fa, his soul, into it and so he was bound to it. ~~Ofc Sauron was able to take it off himself and he wouldn't die or anything, but Isildur cut off his finger and his power was reduced, allowing the elves and men kill Saurons body.~~ His body was destryed after the ring was lost because most of his force was bound to it. Remembered this wrong.

It is said that the ring enhances persons natural powers. For example it only made Bilbo, Frodo and Smeagol invisible and Hobbits (and Stoor) were naturally sneaky and good at hiding from plain sight. But they couldn't wield its full power. Gandalf refused to even touch it because as Maia, he could have used the ring to it's full potential and it would have corrupted him. Way I understand it, the ring actually doesn't give you any magical powers. 

But I must add that I am no expert on this subject. I have read LOTR trilogy, The Hobbit and Silmarillion,  but there is alot I don't know about middle-earth </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been playing for 2 years and I really like. Don't expect it to be a "skyrim with friends" type of game like most people thought it would be. It is still a mmo. Reason I like it is that it is a lot of fun and to me it still feels like a elder scrolls game. It is fairly true to the lore, has lot of interesting npc's and areas and tries to bring that exploration style gameplay from elder scrolls games. 

You will enjoy it the most if you keep in mind that it is a mmorpg so it plays different than single player rpg's </TEXT>

<TEXT> To get more AoE you could equip Steel Tornado from DW skill tree and Barrage from bow skill tree. You will become more powerfull in PvP once you level more and get more skills and passives and better gearset. I've seen Nightblade take down 8 people in 4 seconds in PvP.

In terms of survivability most of your healing skills from siphoning skill tree are heal over time, which kinda sucks. One skill you must run is siphoning attacks, that way you never have problems with recources.

Also I have been selling my crafting mats just the way you said, saving at least 15 of everything. I also have the sword collection if I ever need money. I save them just for sake of saving and I doubt I will never need that lvl 10 unique sword but I'm a hoarder! Most of them are worth 200-1000 so if I ever need money I can easily sell them (once I get B W and start crafting grandmaster gear..) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just finished crafting my master armor (mix of Wolf and Feline) and was broke. I had 50 gold on my character once I finished up crafting my swords and was thinking about selling my unique weapons from my stash (I got like 50 of them because I'm you classical rpg hoarder) but then I realized that I will never need my lesser glyphs. I already have all my armor and weapons enchanted with greater glyphs so what the hell. I sold all.

Went from 50g to 12,000g. 100 hours to the game I had picked up few glyphs on my travels. This is really easy way to make some extra money. You can also sell normal glyphs if you don't think you'll need them anymore. I saved those, just in case... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Graphic designer here. Flat landscapes have been around since the 50's. Oldest posters to use double exposure I have seen were from 70's. It is nothing new to use these together, Olly Moss just popularized them in the gaming community and tbh even though I *love* Olly Moss' work, he shouldn't get credit for "inventing" it either since it has been around forever.

But you can see that these posters have been inspired by the style which many people do, including Moss. But getting inspired by someone elses work is part of design, and often certain themes bring up same ideas on people.

EDIT: Also that flat landscape art is pretty much inspired by chinese paper cutout art which has been around forever </TEXT>

It kinda showed the relationship witchers have. Altought its different since they already knew eachother") 

But you make good case about witchers getting bad name from him, but it seems like most people already have that image of witchers (which is probably why they didnt pay him and tried to kill him), so the cat school witcher only matched their expectations.

I really like reading other peoples opinions on this because it shows how different everyone plays Geralt.  </TEXT>

Also what was done was done, it's not like Geralt had a reason to avenge the people in the village and risk his life fighting another witcher, which would not be easy thing to do. 

Also the witcher had just risked his life saving those villagers. Put himself in danger and got cheated again, this time by village that obviously could afford to pay him more than 12 gold. Ofc it wasn't right to kill those people but like you said, it's not black and white </TEXT>

<TEXT> Definetly one of my favourite sidequests. I loved the fact that the cat school witcher noticed that I was wearing feline armor and a wolf medallion. Too bad the quest was so short, thats the only bad thing about it. Ended up sparing the witcher because he regretted what he did and the rage he was in reminded me of the part of the books where Geralt fights Rience and his men and after Rience gets away (because of Philippa) Geralt was in a blind rage because of the elixirs so I'd imagine the other witcher was going trough similiar (he was also wounded like Geralt). And also Blaviken.

This game keeps suprising me with it's well written contracts. Some of them have actual stories instead of being same repeatable quest again and again. Which choise did you choose?  </TEXT>

I wouldn't say that. She just sees herself as "better" than others because she came from suffering before becoming a sorcerer. She is also very kind to people who she cares about, for example Dandelion.

Triss on the other hand often shows tremendous amounts of compassion for her friends and fellow mages

I am in 2 guilds so I haven't had any problem with the social aspect even thought I don't have any friends who play it. Also I love the Elder Scrolls setting. I didn't approach the game as ES game but the fact that I'm already familiar with the world and lore helped me. Also it keeps getting better with new updates.

But then again it is the only MMO I have enjoyed so don't know how much my opinion counts. For example I played Guild Wars 2 for around 30 hours and didn't really care for it </TEXT>

<TEXT> Go check out alcasthq.com, one of the top PvE players in the world. He is part of the top guild in the world (Hodor) and makes wonderfull builds. Most of them are made for end game PvE (trials) but also work in solo content like Vet Maelstorm arena. 

I would look into his mag sorc build that has amazing sustain and single target damage and nice AoE.

Mag DK that has awesome AoE damage and you can wipe out lots of mobs in seconds. Also DK's have good shields too. 

Then there are Mag NB that does great single target damage, has huge resource pools and ability to self heal trough siphoning abilities.

Mag templars (or stamplar) have the best heals which helps you on tough situations but it lacks shields like NB and has okay damage.

Right now magicka based characters are probably the best in meta. Especially for PvE. Stam sorcs are also great, but I think for solo content you should go with mag because you can run destro and resto (with resto passives its really easy to get more magicka when you run out)  </TEXT>

Also the download asks for 80GB of free space (if I remember correctly) but the game takes under 50GB. The download itself is between 50-70GB.

Bad things about MMO's is that they take alot of space so it kinda sucks if you have small hard drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The dlc's aren't actually needed to enjoy the game. The base game has alot of things to do and the dlc's just mostly add some more quests (you have plenty of those in the areas of all 3 alliances) and some new gear sets/style that you can pretty easily buy with ingame gold. Also it is pretty big download, I think first time download is around 60-80gb so it isn't *that* much more than some single player games

So if that is what is pushing you away you should definetly try out the game!  </TEXT>

I don't see whats so funny about this *Oh look at these people making racist slurs and me reacting to it hahaha* humour. It's too obvious and unfunny imo. Same way that South Park is.

not specifically attempting to get attention. Seeing as how he's already the most popular YouTube personality

True, but I see these types of attemps at humour and shocking things his way to trying to stay that way and relevant. Just like youtube channels that use clickbait titles and "youtube drama" channels. All his videos now need is GONE WRONG and GONE SEXUAL in the titles. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a textbook battlemage. Defencive and healing magic. Nature magic exists, can't remember the name but there was book in morrowind that mentioned some kind of bosmer druid-type healer. Cryomancers/frostmages have been in every game since Morrowind and summoners too. 

I don't see how this would break the lore. I don't think "Warden" is very good name for this class (doesn't really fit the description of the class) but from lore perspective this isn't any different from templar. Blood magic didn't exist before ESO either yet nighblades have it.

This game is expanding the lore just like Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim did. In Oblivion your magica restored over time. It didn't work like that in Morrowind and there are several books in the games that say that magica doesn't restore over time, was that lore breaking for you? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-02-12 14:20:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been playing NB tank (argonian) for around 6 months now and I really like it. I got 350cp and recently I've been having problems tanking. I couldn't even tank vCoS today. My stats are around 20k magicka, 27k health and 18k stamina (buffed) and for some reason I'm having trouble with tanking. 

I'm using 4x alkosh (trying to get a ring so I'll have 5), 2x bloodspawn and 5x ebon (Tava's favor for basic dungeons). I don't really know what my problem is, I get one shotted by bosses, run out of stamina (this doesn't happen too often, siphoning strikes is bomb).

Anyone else play NB tank? I have used alot of gold on this build, on gear and respeccing and I really like playing tank so it is very frustrating that it doesn't work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm guessing when you say warlok you mean Sorcerer? If you want good dps don't use sword and board. With my mag dps dk I use 2 inferno staves but also DW is also good dps if you want to do melee. Focus most on Ardent Flame skill line and if you're a Dunmer you get nice buff on flame abilities.

My favorite mag dk builds:

[Kindling Power by Pretzl](http://tamrielfoundry.com/topic/pve-2-3-x-kindling-power-the-salty-version-of-a-magicka-dk/)

[Valakast by Alcast](http://alcasthq.com/valakas/)

Haven't tried this one but [here's Venom by Alcast](http://alcasthq.com/venom/) if you want to play stamina dps. All are PvE builds. Mag DK is very different from sorcerer so it might get bit getting used to. But it is very fun and powerfull magicka character for PvE </TEXT>

Well he left for work before I woke up and whole day I was super mad at him no idea why. I probably would have kicked him out if he had been there in the morning when I woke up.

Well in the evening when he came from work he told me that I had been sleepwalking the previous night and when he had told me to go back to bed I gad yelled "**FINE**" and gone back to bed. That was apparently the reason I was mad at him. So fucking weird. It's hard to tell the difference between real and dream sometimes </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> *Gandalf was shorter in stature than the other two; but his long white hair, his sweeping silver beard and his broad shoulders, made him look like some wise king of ancient legend. In his aged face under great snowy brows his dark eyes were set like coals that could leap suddenly into fire*

For some reason I always liked this description. It gives very different picture of gandalf that we've heard so far in the book. Kinda gives the idea that even thought Gandalf is seen as a lonely grey wanderer, by most there is hidden power in him. Especially since it shows even next to Glorfindel and Elrond. </TEXT>

But crashes are very common in trials on pc too. Last saturday on Veteran Maw of Lorkhaj during our 6 hour raid I crashed twice and I think we had around 6-7 crashes/losing connection overall for people in the raid </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay this isn't exactly the same but I can give some insight. I worked few summers planting trees and summers were hot 20+ celcius but we still wore pretty heavy clothing. It was basicly for 3 reasons

1. Mornings were cold as hell. Before the sun rose high it was pretty cold so it was important to wear long sleeves and even layers

2. Sun is a real bitch. You really need to cover yourself up and I'd imagine in wild west it would have been even worse

3. Mosquitos and other bugs. This depends alot on area and tbh I have never been to american west so don't know how big problem bugs are there but they sure are real problem. One day wearing a t-shirt and your arms and upper body would be pretty much covered in bites </TEXT>

<TEXT> Leveling happens pretty much by questing which is alot of fun. Mostly the quests are very well written. Then there are 4-man dungeons and solo delves which can be done at any level. PvP can be done from level 10 foward and it is only in Cyrodiil. There is a server for players who are under lvl 50 (max level).

12-man raids are mainly end game stuff. Thats where most PvE players get their gear. EU population is good imo. There is one mega server so no several servers. 

Crafting is lot of fun imo, easy to do on the side. You mostly gather mats in the world like mining, flower and pelts from mobs. Also you need to "research" traits which allow you to craft more powerfull gear sets.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I usually don't discuss religion in reddit but sure I could expand a bit.

I think that the idea of god or some other divine power can't be proven or disproven. When you look at the size of the universe and how infinitely small the chances are of earth exisisting in this exact spot with the exact properties so that life can thrive and evolve on the surface of our planet, I think it would be foolish to completely deny the possibility of some higher power. 

EDIT: A word </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think religion is a wonderful thing. The fact that someone can find comfort in the idea of afterlife or god/s in hard times in their lives and that idea pushes you to be better person and be friendly and nice to everyone is just wonderful. Religion can be a beautiful thing if you let it be. As long as you can look for the deeper meaning and metaphors in the texts instead of taking them literally as 100% truths

Sure it can be bad too but what can I say, I'm an optimist </TEXT>

Of course the tattoo artist is making money off it but it is not easy to recreate tattoo from image so the tattoo artist is also doing lot of work.  I wouldn't call it stealing. If it was stealing, getting a tattoo would be really difficult since you'd had to track down original artist on some image you saw online </TEXT>

<TEXT> What /u/ArkBirdFTW said is very true, but Skyrim is still amazing game and does some things better than Witcher 3. Skyrim is much more free game, you don't need to worry about playing too much ahead in main quest that you miss some side quests. Also Skyrim has much better RP in my opinion. The replay value is better because you can play in different playstyles. You can choose to play a heroic dragonborn and save the world or you can play a thief and steal everything that isn't nailed down. Also with mods you can play just a simple wanderer, hunting and fishing and selling goods if thats your cup of tea

I love both games alot. They both have their strong areas and weak areas. One big difference is that Skyrim is high fantasy and Witcher aims for more realistic. Both games have great lore, but Witcher has much better writing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh man, wait till you finish the series, so many amazing moments ahead. Especially a scene where [Minor Spoiler](/s "Geralt and Yen are having sex after Geralt said I love you to her for the first time and after Yen is reading Geralts mind and Geralt starts thinking about things that would make Yen happy. He accidentaly thinks about dream about him and Yen living quiet life in a cabin in the woods that Geralt has build himself, with Ciri, who is basicly a child to Geralt and Yen, visiting them time to time") I always found that scene to show what their relationship truly is </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's hard to come by similiar rough humour and great writing. A Song of Ice and Fire has similiar aspects but Witcher series is definetly more high fantasy than ASOIAF. 

I enjoy the LOTR books as bit of a counterweight to witcher series. While Witcher had this kinda dark, real life mixed with high fantasy feel, the LOTR has more lighthearted fantasy.

I think the Witcher books are unique. Simply because the characters are so amazing and the dialoque is very well written. Witcher is definetly one of my all time favorite series. I'm suprised how few game fans in this sub has read them </TEXT>

The only reason I have been able to cope is that I can joke about it. Especially with my siblings who understand what I'm going trough.

And the bts is great watch. You see how Peter Jackson really struggled to get these movies out and Sir Ian McKellen kept a copy of the book in the pocket of his costume so he could make suggestions about making the movie more like the book.

Thing I most hate about these movies is that they were filmed infront of a greenscreen while LOTR had this amazing scenery </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been playing Witcher 3 (big fan of the books, love the game) and I keep stressing about reaching a point of no return and missing out on side quests. The main quest is amazing and I'm interested playing it but at the same time I want to complete side quests. 

I've had this in other games too. I kinda don't want to leave from the mainquest to spend hours around chasing chickens while world is in danger (or in witchers case, closest thing I have of daughter). It feels like stopping book in the middle.

This is one thing I liked about Skyrim. No quests automaticly failed after completing main questline.

<TEXT> I'm finnish and my parents live in the woods (30 kilometers to the closest town) and we had alot of animals around. Mooses, Lynx, foxes even occasional bear and wolf. Well one of our neighbours (who lived around 1km away) had a habit of throwing leftover food out at side of a field and a fox would go and eat it and it became customed to human precence.

Well one night my mum came from work and the fox was sitting at the corner of our house (no idea why) and my mother tried to shoo it away with a broom stick. Well the fox didn't think nothing of it and when my mom started to inside the fox tried to follow her.

Now we wouldn't get close to the fox because we had no idea if he had any diseases or lice or something like that. Also we had a cat and a dog inside and if they had seen the fox a whole hell would have broken loose.

Tl;dr: A neighbour threw leftover food outside, fox ate it and thought all humans give food and tried to come inside our house. </TEXT>

<TEXT> IMO when she locked Barney and Robin I'm the room she was being a good friend. She knew that if they only were friends with benefits it would crash and burn and most likely end their friendship. Even thought they eventually did crash and burn, at least they got to be in a real relationship and had some good times.

Also Lily isn't only bad friend in the group. Tbh Marshall and Barney are the only ones. Ted makes everything about himself and his problems, lily is selfish and manipulative, Robin is also very selfish and doesn't really care about the group. first she sleeps with 2 of the 3 guys in the group, basically brakes boths heart, leaves her best friend after divorcing one of the guys. And I just imagine that her and Ted's relationship did not last after the shows ending. 

But this is a sitcom. The characters are made extreme versions of real life people in the sake of comedy, just take a closer look at any sitcom characters </TEXT>

I guess there is very little of what I can do. There are 9 graphic designer positions open in the country I live and 4 of those are for developers. And all but 1 is at least 500km away.

Also damn I wish that jobs would inform that I am not suitable applicant or that I didnt get the job. Wating is so annoying </TEXT>

<TEXT> First I want to say that this game is awesome. The combat is fun, game world is gorgeous, characters are interesting and the boat combat and basic pirating is lots of fun. Only thing I dont like about the game is that it doesn't *feel* like an Assassin's creed game. Towns are fairly small so parkour isn't that much fun and I'm 14 hours in (around 30%) and the Assassin's Creed is only a small side plot. Edward is just a pirate who happens to wear the outfit of dead assassin and has some assassin friends. I just got my diving bell and found out that [James Kidd is a chick](#s "James Kidd is a chick"). And I'm still not an actual assassin. 

But overall its great game </TEXT>

I like open world and freedom in games and I'm worried that in black flag there is going to be lot of small areas to explore and most of my time is spent on a ship. Especially if it turns out that I dont enjoy the sailing.

 I'm also interested in pirates as setting. And that the main character is a pirate instead of just an assassin </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seriously, 70 hours in and I'm really having problems choosing a faction. I've done some quests for all, I'm at

Minutemans: Taking independence

Railroad: Boston After Dark/Underground Uncover

Institute: Battle of Bunker Hill

Brotherhood of Steel: Semper inficta/ Haylens and Rhys quests (just started this one)

So far I cant just decide which one I like the most. I like Railroads idea of saving the synths, but at the same time I dont like that they want to release the mad programmed-to-kill synths in the world also. Their cause seems alright but kinda over the top. Also I do not like any of the npc's at railroad

Brotherhood of Steel has so far the best npc's and pretty dope HQ. But they hate synths and ghouls which is kinda contradictory to the fact that I sometimes travel with Nick and Hancock. But they seem to be alright otherwise

Institute is no for me, there is no confusion. They are super shady and my character doesn't believe that Father is Shaun, he believes its just some Institute plot. 

Minutemen. They seem like a joke. I just can't take that faction seriously and I think I am going to be part of the minutemen even if I pick some of the 3 other factions? Correct if I'm wrong. 

What did you choose and why?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is mentioned that they are good friends. IIRC it was on Thanedd that Geralt was criticizing Yen on being too hard on Triss she says something along the lines that their friendship goes past Geralt. Not sure if it was on Thanedd but I always got the feeling that they were actual friends, not like Yen and Sabrina Glevissig </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I'd imagine this fanbase, like most fantasy fanbases, has lot of cosplay fans too. I myself dont care for it but I still like to see pictures of well made cosplays because you see how much the people love the franchise. Putting tens of hours into creating character costume is pretty amazing way to show the developers/writers that you enjoy their game/book </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even thought I'm not huge cosplay fan, I can understand why people enjoy it. There is huge amount of work put in these costumes and its fun to see people who really enjoy what they do sharing their work (when its oc). 

Its same when people share their art. Sure you dont really get anything out of it but its fun to see.

<TEXT> But in the books they still are good friends. Even when Yen first meets geralt she says that she is going to tell about it to her dear friend Triss Merigold (or something along those lines)

Altought Yen kinda did tear Triss a new one at Thanedd after catching her eyeballing Geralt. </TEXT>
