<TEXT> I had just made it home in time to make some dinner, leftovers from last night to be exact. I tell ya, it's hard work having to file papers and do all the other stupid shit your boss tells you to do for five days a week only to have to come home to  more work around the house. Me being single and all, theres nobody to help out. But honestly, the single life isnt all that bad, you dont have  to do anything for anyone and you dont have to deal with the drama. Its just me, and me alone. I will admit it does get pretty lonely here, but I manage. Just turn on the TV and hope for something decent to pop up, or go for a nice run to empty my head. Sometimes, if I want to treat myself I might  even send in a request to my boss for me to work at home because I'm too sick. I'm not really sick. Well, sick of all the employees I have to work with, yes.

I had made it home that night, heated the leftovers, ate, and was ready to shower and go to bed. I went into the bathroom and got undressed. My bathroom isn't anything to brag about. Theres a toilet that always clogs and cabinets that are always disorganized from me scrambling to get ready in the morning for work. Directly across from the shower is the sink and mirror, which has a single long crack to the right of the mirror, webbing from the bottom corner and reaching for the upper right corner. I left the door open because fuck it, who would care? 

I hopped into the shower, and just as I was about to turn the water on I noticed... something. Something that, to this day, I cant explain. Through the mirror so weird that it gave me chills up my spine and almost made me jump. I wanted to scream or yell but couldn't. Through the mirror I could see into my room from where I was a figure standing in my bedroom doorway. It stood with its head almost touching the upper door frame. It had two small white eyes that looked as if it had no life or personality. In those eyes where two barely distinct pupils that just stared at me, but not just at me, through me, like it could see the innards of my soul. It was like as if it were studying me. The figure lacked any expression on his face except for the most eerie smile I'd ever seen. I'll never forget that smile it had. The smile on its face was so bone-chilling it paralyzed me. It stretched from one side of his right eye to the other side of his left eye, and in it contained a set of pure white teeth. I could also make out the most unusually sized hands. No, claws. Its arms dangled to about where its knees were. I could see the texture of its skin, wrinkled with a dark gray tone from what I could make out in the dim light. The figure just stood there, motionless as I looked upon it with nothing but absolute terror and fear surging through my veins. 

Once I finally got ahold of myself  I quickly got out of the shower and peered through the doorway and noticed that there was nothing but darkness in my bedroom doorway. I exhaled in relief. Thank god, it was just my twisted imagination. I ignorantly chuckled and thought about how maybe I should get a roommate. My thoughts were interrupted as I returned to the bathroom. I looked in the mirror and screamed. It was back. Through the mirror. This time with its mouth completely open, its eyes staring at me, and still smiling. A horrible sound was coming from it, like an echoing scream, and it kept getting louder. I quickly began to break down, the sheer terror was causing me to lose my mind. As the screaming continued to get louder i began to realize that the sound wasnt coming from anything it was inside my head. The sounds bouncing all around the inside of my brain, beating it to a pulp. My eyes became fixed on the figure who I was looking at through the mirror. I went outside the bathroom and looked again through my bedroom doorway. Still no figure, but I could still hear the screaming in my ears, louder and louder. 

I quickly went back into the bathroom and grabbed a towel to wrap around me. I headed for the living room and grabbed my phone to dial 911. The phone was dead and I had gotten rid of my home phone several months ago.

Suddenly
The screaming and the noises went away.

I didn't shower that night. I went into the kitchen and grabbed a cup of coffee and got into my pajamas and sat up in bed completing any extra assignments from work. Hopefully the caffeine would keep me up the rest of the night until morning.

What was that thing? Was I imagining it or was I just going crazy? Why could I only see it through the mirror? Just thinking about it gave me the creeps.

It was around midnight when suddenly all the power in my house went out.I should have known. It was so dark. I couldnt see anything, not even the palm of my hand close up to my face. The hallway light turned on. It was flickering, on and off. I had never had any problems with the lights in this house up until now. I could hear the TV from my room. It had turned on as well. I could hear a muffled voice coming from the TV. From what I could make of it it sounded like someone was saying, Get out! Get help! Go! Hes coming! 

I truly was losing my mind. As I was hearing this I didnt even move from my bed. Sweat was beginning to drip from my face, and I began to shake.

The hallway light turned completely off, all I could hear was the TV. The voice was still muffled with the occasional audio distortion and continuing to say the same thing, Get out! Get help! Go! Hes coming!

The hallway light turned on again, flickering with rage. That's when I began to scream. The figure was standing in the doorway again looking directly at me, but this time I could see it without having to look through a mirror. It looked even more terrifying than before. Its mouth opened and it began to scream again. The screaming was more high pitched than before. I was paralyzed, like I was in some sort of trance. I couldnt move. I could only stare into its horrid eyes as it walked towards me and began to crawl onto my bed. I tried to use my legs to try and attempt to fight back but they couldnt move. I tried moving my arms but I had no control. They were motionless. My eyes started to twitch as the figure grasped my head with both of its hands. My screaming began to fade to a small raspy noise shooting out the back of my throat. 

My entire body was motionless, my heart was beating frantically. I tried to make any possible noise now but it was too late, I couldnt muster a single sound. I was a motionless body, completely vulnerable to anything. The figure had stopped screaming, but I could hear it breathing. His face was very close. I was face-to-face with this thing. My eyes began to fill up with tears making it hard to see clearly. I could feel his breathing on my face. I felt his claws running alongside my face and stomach. That's when I could feel the tearing and slashing of my own flesh.

<TEXT> I was at a Hallmark with my mom and sister. And I was looking at all the funny cards, inappropriate, funny etc... And my mom was to the right of me looking at cards. And apparently I didn't  see that she went to a different part of the store, and some other chick takes her place and looks through cards. So I find a funny card with butts on it, being the immature 8 year-old I was, and I go to show her, thinking she's my mom. And  she looks at me in shock and her bf is behind her laughing his ass off. Felt like shit. </TEXT>
