<TEXT> Ingredients:

- 300g (11oz) unsalted butter
- 300g (11oz) dark chocolate (minimum 70% cocoa solids)
- 5 large eggs
- 450g (1lb) granulated sugar
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract
- 200g (7oz) plain flour
- 1 tsp salt

You will also need:

- A roasting tin 13x10in and at least 2 1/4" deep  

Method:  

Preheat the oven to 180C/Fan 160C(ish)/350F/Gas Mark 4. Line the tin with greaseproof paper/baking parchment. Melt the butter and chocolate in a heatproof bowl above a pan of barely simmering water. While this is melting, beat the eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract together until the mixture is thick and coats the back of a spoon. When the butter and chocolate have melted together, take off the heat and allow to cool slightly, so as not to curdle the egg mixture. Pour the chocolate/butter into the egg mix, and beat to combine. Sift the flour and salt together, and add to the mixture. Beat until smooth. At this point, you can add any extras, like chopped nuts, or dried fruit.  

Pour the mix into the roasting tin, and ensure it's evenly distributed. If you want to add anything in the middle (I recommend oreos, especially double stuff!), pour half the mix in and level it out. Add the ingredients to the centre, and cover with the rest.  

Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or longer if it needs it. This is mostly judged by eye, but they're about done when the crust is beginning to crack in the top and around the sides, and when the mix stops wobbling when you give it a shake. I also stuck a knife in the very centre, and checked the consistency of the mix. If it's *really* runny, you might want to pop them back in for a bit, but don't overcook them! It's best to take them out sooner, and put them back in if they need it. The ones in the picture took about 30 minutes in my oven, but YMMV.  

Let the giant brownie cool in its tin for about 20 minutes. Cut the brownie into squares in the pan. The paper should peel off easily. </TEXT>

McCoy jumped to the right of Martinez and fired two fatal shots of 00-buckshot with his 12-gauge shotgun, hitting Whitman in the head, neck and left side.

Martinez threw down his now-empty revolver and grabbed McCoy's shotgun, running to Whitman's supine body and firing point blank into his upper left arm. Martinez threw the shotgun onto the deck and hurriedly left the scene, repeatedly shouting the words, "I got him."

Ramiro Martinez was initiallyand incorrectlycredited by the media as being the officer who killed Whitman.

<TEXT> Thanks for the fast reply.

* I've tried both automatic allocation, and defining an IP, default gateway and both Google and the router as a DNS server, with no change. Is there a way to configure a DHCP server address on the Windows side? The router has a page for it where I can reserve an IP address for a MAC address, but this does nothing when I try statically assigning the same IP on my machine.
* I've tried disabling and re-enabling the ethernet controller, but this also does nothing to change it.
* I'm on a home network that connects to a Virgin Media router. I'm using powerline adapters to connect to the box, which have been working fine previously and for 2 of the other wired connections in the house.

Thanks for your suggestions. Is there anything else you could recommend? I appreciate your help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys,

Been having a bit of an issue for the past week or so. My internet's been a bit sporadic, occasionally cutting out for 5 mins or so then coming back. Recently, these outages have been more like 2-5 hours, and nothing seems to resolve it. It's logged as an unidentified network, and is using a 'fake' ip (169.xxx...) instead of getting one from the DCHP server. When I try to contact using ipconfig /release and /renew, the DCHP server is unavailable. However, every other device on the network connects fine, and even with wireless my desktop can't connect. Any advice would be great.

System Specs:
MSI MS-7693 motherboard (970-A G46)
Ethernet Driver: Realtek PCIe Family Controller (version 8.1.510.2013)

Let me know if there's any other info you need - as far as I know it's fairly localised to my machine so I'd be surprised if there's anything wrong with the router.

Thanks!

<TEXT> Correct me if I'm wrong, but the lower end versions of these machines ($599 and $699) appear to have PSUs that are too underpowered for the GPUs. The R9 270 requires a minimum 500W PSU, and the 750ti requires 300W, but the default one supplied is a 250W PSU.

Not sure if this is a mistake, but that would worry me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We went to see the Return of the King in the cinema. For those of you who have seen it, there's a sequence at the end of the film where there's lots of fade to black/white transitions between the Hobbits being picked up/being healed/going to the Grey Havens. After two or three of these, some guy had had enough, and when the next fade out happened, he just yelled at the top of his lungs "OH FOR FUCK'S SAKE!" </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think Thief and Dishonored are really comparable in some ways. Thief, at least for me, has always been a purely stealth game. Dishonored allowed you to be the assassin as well as the ghost, so it has more combat development. I loved Dishonored a lot, but Thief is still different enough to it that I can't compare the two side by side and say which is better. </TEXT>

I'll start with mine: The shiv could have something like a neckhold, with you stabbing the player 2-3 times in the back, and stealing tags when you release them. Let me know what yours would be! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The number 11 just makes sense.  

I was downstairs cooking, and my housemate Grant wafts in from upstairs, stinking of B.O. and cheese (his absolute favourite food). Having put a ready meal in the oven for 40 minutes, he had come to check on it, not realising I was downstairs. Now struggling to make conversation in the ever-growing awkward silence, he said "11 minutes. That makes sense." and left the room. It took a moment but I noticed he was referring to his meal, which had 11 minutes left on the clock. Of course, I should have known that in the first place, because *it just makes sense*.    

11 is the perfect number. 11 is life. 11 makes sense to **everyone**.

<TEXT> My mum used to go to the opera with friends in the summer, and everyone would bring a dish to eat in the interval. One time she asked me to make her usual piece - a whole salmon, poached and decorated with paper thin slices of cucumber for the scales and olives for the eyes. When it's finished, the dish looks something like [this.](http://p.twimg.com/ApcjnifCIAEOuKO.jpg:large)  

Having helped out many times before, I got to work while she went out to pick some things up. I put the huge salmon in the fish kettle (a very long steel contraption which has a tray in the bottom with handles to fish out the poached article) and went upstairs while I waited for it to cook.  

When I returned, the salmon had finished poaching, and smelled amazing. The final step before skinning and decorating the salmon was to transfer the cooked fish to the fridge to cool.  

Now, the fridge in my house was pretty close to the hob where I had cooked this massive fish, so transferring shouldn't have been a problem. All I'd have to do was grab the handles, pull the tray up and carefully put the fish on the pre-cleared shelf in the fridge.
So with the door of the fridge open, I extracted the monstrous and very, VERY delicate fish from the kettle. Things were going so well until I bent the handles of the tray slightly out of alignment. The tray was flimsy. The bottom twisted. And a large, perfectly cooked salmon unstuck itself.  

I watched in disbelief as the behemoth gently flopped off the tray.  

The sound of a well cooked fish hitting a pine floor is quite breathtaking. Think of the sound of vomit hitting a tiled surface, but condense the sound to an instant and add a light note of dropped brick. That's about the best way to describe it. The fish hit the ground perfectly on the left flank, and was utterly disintegrated in a shower of bone, scale, and delicately coloured meat.
The fridge door was spattered in gunge, lightly coated in a thin film of fishy oil. 

Cleaning that up was hell. But I did make another fish (without dropping it) in time for the opera.  


TL;DR: Redecorated the kitchen with salmon pebbledash </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys,  

I took my bike out this morning and after coming off a main road, I shifted down to 2nd front from 3rd front. Immediately I heard a repeating grinding noise. I checked it out in the evening when I got home and found that in 2nd, my largest chainring is grinding against the front derailleur due to a wobble. How can I fix this, or do I need to take this into a bike shop?  

I don't remember it being an issue when cycling before the main road this morning (in 2nd), only after I shifted up then down again after the main road. </TEXT>

Now, I already own this on Origin, and where I am the internet download speed is painfully slow, so I want to avoid downloading again if I can. I was wondering if there was a way I could just grab the biggest files, or even the whole game install out of my Origin Games folder, and move it to Steam, allowing it to fill in the gaps of data. Can it be done, and if so, what's the best way to approach it?  
Thanks.  
EDIT: after trying all suggestions, and even doing a full re-install of steam, nothing has worked as of yet. Not sure why it's being so weird about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't say anything about the engine. You're quite right, it's all level design based, but it's still a nice feature. Yes, it's not revolutionary, but it's different, and fairly (and I say this in the loosest sense) unique to the genre. That's why it's so exciting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But that's the whole point. I wouldn't want the game deciding when to cut the power in an apartment block, or when to raise road barriers or cause a support to buckle on a gantry. By allowing players to do these things, you change how the gameplay experience works from game to game. One time, I might walk into a building, cut the power and gun down 2 guys using an IRNV scope, another, I choose not to but instead walk outside and raise the bollards, stopping a tank getting to me. It's not just to make things pretty, and regardless of the outcome being the same, it's changing the game enough to make gameplay interesting. </TEXT>

Freddie was dying, but he never sought sympathy. He always wore a brave face. The band wasn't sure he could record it because of the demanding vocals, but he took a shot of vodka, and said "I'll fucking do it, darling!", performing it all in one take without a hitch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Farming dungeons (esp in BC) is really quick levelling. You can get past most of Outland just by doing a few dungeons, with 1-5 filler quests in between.
2. As above, but with the addition that if you do a full run of Hyjal, it can get you close to 83 (with 1 or 2 dungeons possibly thrown in). I ran it on a fresh, no heirlooms character about 3 weeks ago, and Cata flashed past in no time at all.
3. Pandaria doesn't take that long any more. I hit 87 just as the Jade Serpent storyline hit Sha territory, then Kun-Lai, and finished in Dread Wastes. Supplemented with a few dungeons, it really doesn't take long at all.  
Personally I find WoTLK levelling most annoying, but that wasn't so bad this time around for me. Seemed to be fairly quick. I guess (unfortunately) you might just have to grin and bear some of the most annoying levelling zones. The only other tip I can offer is make sure you're in a lvl 25 guild, so you get the 10% increased EXP. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think it's got much to do with piracy if I'm honest. I think console games prices are high because the publishers and developers have to compete with 3rd party resales of their games. Publishers expect to have recurring revenue for about 3-6 months of their game. If 20 people buy a game, but 30 or 40 people are playing it because of resale, that's 10 or 20 copies the company has lost out on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is more like what I was looking for in a response, so thank you!  

Could you explain how the used games make new games more expensive? It doesn't seem to make sense to me. Surely the publishers and developers are meeting more sales targets, rather than games retailers taking this money? If a game changes hands in a store 2-3 times as a pre-owned game, the publisher sees none of that money.  
Also, with regards to the PS4, I don't see it as much better. They've just taken the opportunity of Microsoft being hated on to sweep some of their downsides under the rug. I am trying to remain as non-biased as possible, and am avoiding next-gen consoles at the moment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi there,
I recently upgraded my CPU and motherboard to squeeze out better gaming performance for my nVidia GTX660ti. Now, the 660ti's fine on temperature, it's often at around 60C under heavy load, which isn't a problem. What I'm concerned about is the high CPU temps I'm getting. I haven't checked it out on many other games, but I have a setting on CoreTemp to tab me out when it gets high, and it's been doing this on Deus Ex, BF3, and a few other games. Should I be looking for an aftermarket cooler?  
Thanks for your help </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just wanted to say how awestruck I am at Battlefield 4 so far. I was stunned and amazed when I saw that skyscraper go down for the first time, and the gameplay I've been obsessively watching has been phenomenal.  
Most of all, I just wanted to say thank you for being on the subreddits and listening! You guys are truly amazing - you've taken things we thought would never see the light of day and put them into what's looking to be the best FPS of the year.  
Huge amount of respect for you guys. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When you're playing WoW, be it in a raid or PvP, how do you control your character? Are you a clicker, or have you bound every ability and macro'd those hard to use ones? Do you move with the keyboard, or only with the mouse? Do you do a bit of both? Post how you move, and then how you use abilities (include keybinds if you wish)  
  
For example: I move with a combination of the mouse and the numlock key (bound to middle mouse). I use a standard set of keybinds for all of my characters: QERF1234, with control and shift modifiers, giving me 24 usable keybinds in quick reach. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We've been making a small sidescroller as a mid level jam. The core mechanic (which we still haven't got fully implemented) is a defibrillator to keep your heartbeat going faster, so you can run faster and get more points, but it has a price. It will randomly rebind your jump and crouch keys, giving you a few seconds to adjust, and (if we get round to it) possibly flip your screen all different ways or invert all the colours. Blood packs keep your health filled up, and you have to jump and slide to avoid obstacles. Here's a WIP screenshot of it (showing the awesome slide sprite we have): http://i.imgur.com/kmFF4PV.png </TEXT>

<TEXT> First comment in this reddit, dunno if I'll be of assistance.  
When you put the PC together, did you try running it with just the bare essentials in (e.g. no GFX or anything extra) or did you put it all in at once? Second, have you tried switching the socket the PC is in? One of the builds I did a few months ago had the same problem, but was apparently resolved when we switched the power lead to a new socket. It seemed to be power based anyway, and my guess is that this problem is to do with power or connections to power switches.  
Hope I can be of some help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This, a thousand times. I think it's so important to sample different things and have a go at stuff. Even not food related, it's a great life tip to take away. If you don't like it, you don't have to have it again. That combined with alcohol taught me that I don't really like it, and it wasn't taboo for me. It never had the appeal that it had with other people at school, and so I never got wasted, or drunk.    

As a side note, my dad and I very rarely order the same thing at an exotic restaurant because we always try new stuff, which is nice :P </TEXT>

<TEXT> Think of it like velcro. The air, which in this example represents the hooks on the velcro, is moving across the water's surface. The water molecules are like felt balls, jumping around with some energy.  
If a ball jumps high enough, and there is space for it on the velcro, it is picked up by this velcro surface.  
If the puddle has a large surface area, meaning these balls are spread out more, rather than being stacked, the velcro can pick these up much faster because more of them can jump up and attach themselves.  
And if the velcro is moving quickly across the surface, there's a lot more free space for the balls to latch on, so the puddle dries up quicker.
      
But if the velcro isn't moving very fast, and there's already a lot of felt balls attached to the velcro, the other ones can't latch on. This is called **saturation**. Also, if the balls aren't jumping very much because they're not very energetic, they won't attach to the velcro, meaning the puddle won't dry up.  I hope this answers your question. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A man was wandering, alone in a forest in rural China </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-07-27 12:07:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> He was getting weary from the long hours of constant walking, and was feeling very thirsty. He stopped to have a look around, and spotted a little shack in the forest. As he approached, an old man with a great long beard came out towards him, and bowed. "I see you are tired from walking, and you look hungry. I will allow you to stay at my house tonight, on the one condition that you do not screw my daughter. If you do, you shall have to face the 3 Chinese torture tests." The man nodded slowly, and gratefully entered the man's house. As he walked into the main room, he was struck by how amazingly beautiful the old man's daughter was. Thinking he would be able to at least be friendly, they sat together over dinner. She was flirty, and he reciprocated. The old man went off to bed, and a few minutes later, the man and his daughter went upstairs together for the night...
The following morning, the man awoke finding not the daughter astride him, but a large rock, and a staggering pain in his testicles. Wincing slightly from the pain, he struggled to sit up. Inscribed on the rock was a message: "Chinese Torture number 1: Wake up with 15kg rock on chest". As he had since recovered from his tiredness, and being a strong man, he hefted the rock with one almighty push out of the window. Watching it sail through the open gap, the rock turned slightly, revealing a second message: "Chinese Torture number 2: Left nut tied to rock". Thinking very quickly, the man jumped out of the window after the rock, and as he did so, read the final message on the bedstead: "Chinese Torture number 3: Right nut tied to bedpost". </TEXT>
