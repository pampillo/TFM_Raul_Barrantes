<TITLE> Did the Amazon book store description just spoil A Scanner Darkly for me? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I had heard some good things about A Scanner Darkly and had no idea exactly what it was about, just that it was thought provoking. So I went to Amazon and read the description, as I do with all books, and it states in the third sentence that [Potential Spoiler](#s "Bob and Fred are the same person").

I feel kind of unenthused to read this now that I feel a major plot point, that seems to have a lot to do with themes of the book, has been spoiled for me.

So, is this as crucial a "twist" as I am assuming? Is this revealed fairly early and is not a crucial reveal moment? I want to enjoy this book but I'm not sure I can force myself to read through it knowing this. </TEXT>

Maybe some form of regeneration? Like photosynthesis but more magical

<TITLE> [CofD / H:tV] Question on the use of the reason system as described in Mirrors. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-26 00:13:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, for those who haven't read it, the book Mirrors talks about a "reason" stat that starts at ten and is reduced when "he accepts a new reality of thinking that goes against reasonable thought or modes of action" until he reaches 0 and is reduced to insanity and is unplayable.

So my question is: would you have a player lose sanity if they were to use a supernatural creature's weakness against it? e.g. using silver vs. werewolves, a stake through the heart for a vampire. Or what if they were to destroy a ghost's anchor? It seems that in order to fight these supernatural beings they'd have to sacrifice sanity.

That makes sense to me, but what if the game changes from Humans to Hunters? Do Hunters have the same risk of insanity? Everything that they deal with would cause them to lose sanity, even their own endowments because they require the acceptance of a reality different than our own. Is that just the risk they take? Is it just thematically appropriate that they will eventually go mad the more they learn? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The beetle begins its life very small and, when introduced to a host, burrows toward its heart. Once it has reached the heart, its body begins to fuse with the heart's tissue as it releases a paralytic toxin. The beetle's growth is then exponentially increased as its body grows to eventually replace the heart, devouring all the tissue that was once there. As it grows, its "legs" expand through the host's arteries and veins, extending through limbs essentially forming a second skeleton.

Once the beetle has grown to its full size and taken control of the host, it stops producing its toxin and uses the body to incubate its eggs. The eggs are produced into the esophagus and they move to the host's stomach. The beetle continually produces these eggs until the host is swollen with them. When the eggs hatch the stomach of the host ruptures, releasing hundreds of tiny beetles, free to find a new host.

As for new uses:

Possibly use the growth hormone to increase growth of host.

Or engineer a subspecies of beetle that instead grows a different part, like its wings or carapace, allowing for flying or armored ~~zombies~~ test subjects.

Engineer mutualistic symbiotic subspecies that attaches to outside of host and creates exoskeleton, giving bonus strength/armor.

Take samples of the paralytic toxin for extremely effective paralyzing poison. </TEXT>

Something like (Virgil 89; 2.541)?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, all. I've got a question about intelligent species in worlds.

Is it possible for more than one sapient race to evolve in one region with out any sort of physical barriers between them?

My first reaction to this is that one would reach sapience then the surrounding species would form some sort of relationship with them (symbiotic, predator/prey, etc.) and that would halt the evolutionary progress of the non-sapient race. But I have little to no knowledge of exactly what causes the ascension to sapience...

Any input, guidance, or reading materials would be greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, all.

Tech: I have an android phone, my friend has an iphone

I recently exchanged numbers with someone and was patiently awaiting the confirmation text. The next day when I saw them we checked to see if the numbers had been put in correctly. She then called my phone to see if that would work. It did and right after the call, I got all of the text messages immediately after. Since then, I've not received any more messages.

I've tried searching for a solution ( google, /r/Android, and here ), but i can only find solutions for users who have switched from an iPhone to an Android. The solution was to turn off iMessage on the old iPhone. So I was wondering if having my friend turn their iMessage off will fix the issue, or if there is any other way to fix this I would be glad to hear it.

Thank you in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thud of the door behind me pierces the pre-existing and apparent silence in the apartment.

"Great," I mutter to myself, "this again."

Nothing. 

No sounds. 
No T.V. voices, no dishes clattering, no dishwasher running, nothing.

I maneuver myself to the kitchen, trying my best to avoid the garbage and miscellaneous clutter on the floor. I wish I could clean this up, but being out all day just drains any energy I had.

I try to remove some of the silence with the preparation of a simple sandwich. Though, theres little noise to be made with a bag of bread, a container meat, and a bottle of mustard.

I take my plate and melt into the couch. I reach for the remote and turn the T.V. on, hoping to kill some of the invasive silence. I must have flipped between every channel while eating my sandwich, then three more times before deciding there was nothing good on.

Nothing. Its always nothing, isnt it?

I set my plate on the ever present and always growing pile next to the couch, turn the T.V. off, and start making my way to the bedroom. One day, Ill pick them up, but for now I just want to sleep.

I wish I could afford to keep the T.V. on; it helps keep the silence out when Im trying to sleep. However, times are rough and its in my best interest to just deal with the silence.

As I shut the bedroom door behind me and stare at the always empty bed, I let out a pathetic, withering, awful sigh. Again.

Its always nothing, isnt it?

My eyes start to water and my throat starts to tighten as I flick off the lights and stumble towards the bed in the dark. I lift the covers and allow myself to be enveloped by the emptiness; by the silence. I try and hold the tears back as the silence berates me. 

Maybe one day I wont have to deal with the silence. Maybe Ill be able to rid myself of it.

But that wont be any time soon. </TEXT>
