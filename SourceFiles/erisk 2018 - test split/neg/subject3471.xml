I may only be ten, but Im old enough to know when something isnt right.

And things arent right.

I thought about the eyes all night last night, which was a long night. I hardly slept at all, because I kept hearing someone walking around in the woods outside my house. 

I snuck out early this morning just after sunrise. I hoped that I would look and be unable to find any footprints, which would mean I was just imagining things. 

There were a lot of footprints.

They came from out of the woods. I could follow them all around the house. They stopped at every window, including my parents, like whoever it was was looking into each one.  Then they led back into the woods. 

I decided to see where they went, so I followed them. 

Pepperoni came with me, since he pretty much follows me everywhere now. I was glad to have him there, but you could tell that he wasnt coming to play around. He was very serious. 

The footprints went back to where we had found the eye box yesterday. I could tell that the person was looking for them, because there were a bunch of prints all around it, like they just kept walking around looking for something.

The tracks eventually went farther into the trees, but I couldnt follow them anymore, because I had to come back and get ready for school.

Boy, was Pepperoni unhappy to see me go. He just kept whining and tugging so much that Mom had to put a leash on him so that I could get out the door. 

I got a ride to school with Aiden and his dad, but I told them that I didnt need a ride home that day, because I needed to do something after school. His dad thought that was a little strange, because he always takes us home, but I convinced him that my parents said it was okay.

That was a lie, and I know Im not supposed to lie, but I havent told my parents at all. I want to keep them safe.

So after school I went to the police station and asked to talk to Captain Grinnick. Our city is pretty small, and only a few cops work there, so I was able to go into his office and speak with him. 

He smiled in that way adults smile when theyre trying to relate to kids, but arent really good at it because they dont take us seriously.

Hi Derek, he said, and dropped his fake smile. I always want to make sure you kids are as safe as can be. He turned around and started looking through his paperwork. But Im afraid were going to have to be quick about this, Im very busy. A man named Gordon disappeared yesterday, and its the first missing persons case this town has had in twenty years. Theres a lot to do here! He threw on his fake smile again and stared right through me. 

I realized that whoever dug the hole must have brought the eyes in from far away. Because there were so, so many eyes. We would probably notice that many blind or dead people in our small town.

Captain Grinnick, I was playing in the woods behind my house, with my friend Aiden, and Pepperoni, hes my dog, and, well, we found some eyes. Like a whole box of them. Buried in the ground. I havent told anyone, because I though the person who got those eyes probably hurt the people they came from, and if they knew I had them, they might come looking for me or my family to hurt us, too.

His expression got real dark, and he got up to close the door to his office. When he sat back down, he was done pretending to smile.

I see, Derek. So you havent told anybody?

No, I said, just me and Derek and Pepperoni know. I know that it was kind of a lie, because I posted it here online, but I didnt really actually TELL any of you, like with my mouth, did I?

I see, he said again, now youre a smart boy, Derek. To want to keep your family safe like that. Do you want them to stay safe? he asked, and waited for an answer.

Of course, Captain Grinnick, more than anything, I said.

Well then. Youd be wise NOT to tell anyone. This is police business. Lets keep this between JUST you and me. Do you understand?

Yes, I said, even though I didnt, because Im old enough to know that you sometimes tell grownups that you agree with them, even if you dont.

Good, Devin, good, he said, and I knew not to tell him that he got my name wrong. Now. The box of do you have the hmmmm?

I pulled the box of eyes out of my backpack and put it on his desk. He suddenly looked like he was going to puke right then and there.

Good! Good. Now run along, Devin, and remember! here he looked straight at me, and I remember thinking that he was staring so hard that his eyes seemed unnaturally blue, dont tell anyone!

So I walked home after that, and didnt tell anyone.

But after I went to bed, I heard things outside again. 

This time I decided to be brave, because I knew that something was wrong, and was going to get worse. So I grabbed a flashlight and Pepperonis leash, and we went outside. 

Whoever had been making noise was quiet by the time we made it out there. Its scary out there at night. It was super quiet, and I couldnt figure out why there werent more animals making more noise. At first I had been worried that Pepperoni would make a racket, but he didnt bark at all. He did pull, though.

Right to the eye-hole. 

I could tell right away that something was there, something that shouldnt be. But it was hard to tell what it was until we were right next to it.

When I was standing over the thing, I shined my flashlight right down. I was so scared of what I saw that I couldnt move, and I had to keep looking down at it. Im still shaking.

It was Captain Grinnick, and he was dead. I didnt recognize him at first, because it turns out that people look very different when theyre dead. The thing that was most different about Captain Grinnick is that his eyes were gone. There was so much blood streaking down his face, it looked like he had been crying blood. His mouth was open like he was screaming, so it looked like he was in the middle of a temper tantrum. But I could tell he was dead without touching him.

I felt dizzy, and then my feet slipped. I realized later that I had been standing in a lot of blood, and it was very slick. When I landed, my cheek rested again the Captains face. It made me feel sick, because his skin was so cold, like metal.

I got up again quickly, but made sure not to scream, because I knew that there might be someone out there looking to get me.

I noticed that a piece of paper was stuck to my hand by a few drops of blood. I also noticed that it would be a good idea to run home as fast as I could.

Pepperoni wanted to run faster, but every time he got a little bit ahead of me, he would stop and whimper at me to catch up. Which is good, because if he got lost in the forest, I would be stuck trying to find him, but it would be super scary because theres dead bodies with no eyes out there. And boxes of eyes with no bodies. 

So I got home and showered. When I got dressed again, I noticed the piece of paper had fallen by my clothes. So I picked it up and read it.

The note said His eyeballs arent the only balls he lost tonight. Thats it.

Im pretty sure I know what that means, because I think it means the same thing to adults that it does to kids.

Now I dont know what to do.

<TEXT> Hi! My name is Derek. Im ten years old, and I wanted to write about something that happened to me. Because I dont know where else to go.

My friend Aiden and I like to go hiking in the woods behind my house. Theyre really great! A lot of kids talk about pretend forts and stuff that they have, but we have a real one. Its a house that my dad and I built out of plywood, not too far from my back porch. So Aiden and I can actually play in a real fort or clubhouse, or whatever game were playing that day. 

But this isnt about the clubhouse. Its about what happened earlier today. 

Aiden and I like to go exploring in the woods. Its real far away from stuff, so we never see anyone else there. We usually take my dog, Pepperoni, who is pretty much the best dog ever. Hes a golden retriever, and hes three, and hes tons of fun.

Anyways, the woods are big enough so that we can always go exploring some place new, and Pepperoni is always excited to check things out. 

We had just gotten back from a long walk earlier today, and were nearly back to the fort. But we were still in a place that was completely covered by trees. Thats when Pepperoni suddenly got really excited and ran to a spot on the ground. Now this isnt unusual, because hes a pretty energetic dog, but I mean he was like REALLY excited. Like way more than usual. 

He started digging really excitedly, and had gotten a pretty decent-sized hole going by the time that Aiden and I had caught up to him. 

It wasnt long before he found the box. It was about ten inches across, and eight inches long, and six inches deep (were learning about volume in Mrs. Huntingtons class). 

I reached into the dirt and pulled it out. I walked into a gap in the trees so I could see it better in the sun. Aiden walked next to me, but Pepperoni nearly knocked me over, he was getting so excited.

It had a pretty simple latch, so I opened it as soon as we were in the light. I looked inside.

There were eyes. I dont mean fake ones, I mean real human eyeballs, about twenty of them. I could tell that they were real. They had blood. I saw something in the back of each them, and I Googled it, and its called the optic nerve. Some still have eyelids attached. Most do not. 

Its kind of hard to explain, but we can tell theyre fresh. Like, youd be able to tell if they were old. They were not rotten at all.

You can tell that the optic nerves were cut with scissors.

I had to yell a Pepperoni to stop jumping up and down, because I was afraid that he was going to knock them all over the place. I dont usually yell at him, but I think he could tell that I was serious, because he stopped jumping.

What do we do? I asked Aiden. He looked afraid.

I dont know, he said real quiet. Which is a big deal, because Aidens usually not quiet. But somebody did not want these to be found, Im pretty sure. This is bad, Derek. Pretty fricking bad.

Usually were not supposed to swear, but this was an unusual circumstance. 

Im afraid to tell my mom and dad, because if someone is going to hurt the person who has these, then I want to keep my parents safe. I told this to Aiden, and he said it was probably a good idea to keep it safe. Which is strange because Aiden usually doesnt keep any secrets, because he cant keep his mouth shut. 

I think Pepperoni knows somethings up too, because now he wont leave my side. Like hes protecting me.

I told my parents that I was going to bed a little while ago, so Im writing this in secret with the lights off in my room. Im ten years old, Im hiding a box of eyes, and I dont know what to do. 

And I think things are about to get worse, because Im pretty sure Ive been hearing someone walking around the woods outside my house for the past twenty minutes.

We all have moments in our lives when passion gives way to practicality. 

Remember that next time youre wondering why the history books are littered with such monsters.

I found and lost my cousin in a matter of minutes, and had inadvertently caused her untimely death.

Her last moments on this earth were not pleasant. 

Ill have the rest of my life to reflect on the implications of this reality. Though that may very well be a short sentence.

For the moment, I need to focus on the practical.

My tears were real, and the blood was as well. But I felt something bigger take over in the moment, so I went with it.

I crawled to Gordon, who was at this point getting pretty ripe. Ignoring the smell, I reached deep in to his gaping abdominal cavity and squeezed.

I then crawled over to where Lucys still-warm body lay prone. I stared into her half-opened eyes and started to gasp and sob. 

Three quick thrusts to the chest represented passionate attempts at suicide.

Or so it would seem from a grainy VHS camera.

I screamed, rolled, and convulsed. The entrails that I had taken from Gordon now lay on top of my torso.

I gurgled, moaned, and then was still.

I had a very long time to think.

Fighting against my mother was out of the question. Even if I could escape the cage, she would have planned five steps ahead. The camera was outside the chain-link barrier, far beyond my grasp. If damaging it were possible, that would do nothing more than put the viewer on high alert that something was wrong.

This cage was designed to display the scene of my horrible demise. So thats exactly what I engineered. The only way that the game would end is if the viewer (viewers?) saw exactly what they expected to see. There was no other outcome. 

Lying there, I knew that my actions would be questioned. So I steeled myself for the long haul.

I shouldnt have fallen so close to Gordon. It wasnt just the smell, either. The flies were getting pretty active, too. Its amazing what you miss when youre in high-intensity mode; the exact opposite is true as the hours pass and youre not able to move at all.

The flies checked me out, of course. It was just annoying at first. Then they decided to explore my ears. One made it pretty far up my nose. And I should have anticipated that a certain lack of access to hygiene products would make them go crazy for my bare ass. 

Seriously, I could feel every single leg of every single fly back there. I really, really, really wanted to move.

But I did not. It had to have been at least twelve hours, because I pissed myself (subtly) three times, and was very dehydrated by the end.

Though I did not move. Not one goddamn inch. 

Finally (finally, finally) the door to the cage creaked open.

A figure stalked toward me. I deduced that they would check my pulse first, to see if I was playing possum. I was right.

A hand turned me over and reached for my neck. I moved quickly enough to make little Lucy proud. I thrust the butt of the knife into the face of my attacker and heard the crack of a broken nose, followed by the clatter of a weapon to the ground.  

I turned, sprinted, and slipped in Gordons guts.

I still had the wherewithal to keep the knife pointed away from my face when I landed. It hurt like hell, though, and I could felt my chin split. 

A hand wrapped around my ankle.

But I didnt come this far to let it all slip away.

I kicked  hard  and the scream I heard sounded like the pain that would come from someone re-breaking their nose.

This time I made it out of the cage, wheeled around, and closed the door. 

My heart sank as I looked down at my Aunt Myra, sobbing and bleeding. She looked so helpless in the cage, and my softer instincts told me to rush to my family and help her.

I locked the door and turned away. 

There was only one door in the room, and I walked through it now. 

Mom was there, of course. You can always count on mom. 

There are things you dont understand, she said with an odd mixture of detachment and pity. I loved Myra, but I managed to make her go into the cave first. Theres always a way, Phil. Dont fight it. Just accept whats going to happen now.

I looked directly at her as I spoke. Youre right, there are things you dont understand. But I hope you try.

I tossed the knife gently down in front of her. It landed at her feet. I started to cry.

You will always  *always* be my mom, and nothing can ever change that. I walked slowly towards her, with tenderness and care. Im hurt. Im broken. I need my mom now more than ever. I was openly sobbing. I need you to get me through this.

Her hard outer shell now began to give way to clear shock. I knew then, beyond any doubt, that she had intended to kill me then and there.

I wrapped her in a bear hug, and she froze, unsure of what to do. She had truly believed that there was no hope for good, and all that was left would be the end of what we had. She had no idea how to deal with the concept of hope and forgiveness, and it paralyzed her.

Her hesitation was all I needed to stab her hand with the shattered rib I had pulled from Gordons chest and hidden in my palm. I couldnt see it, but I heard the pistol I knew she had been hiding fall to the grown with a metallic thud. She was quick, but I was quicker, and I got the gun. 

I knew that she would never go into the cage alive, but with the gun out of her possession, it was down to brute strength. Even in my emaciated state, I had enough rage to overcompensate.

She went into the cage with Myra.

Myra has the knife but is injured badly. She cant get close enough to my mom to use it without a risk of having it taken. 

My moms trying to hide her injured hand. She knows that it will be revealed if she makes the first move. 

Both of them know the stakes. The game is afoot. And with the camera rolling, I have a front-row seat.

I am my mothers son.

Ive been talking to the girl. 

Do you have any idea how much harder that makes things?

Ive been so focused on the rest of the pain that I did not realize how powerful the loneliness was. 

I could be a hundred miles from home. All I know is that Ive never been here before. The person I loved most is intentionally making me suffer the most, and I know Im almost certainly going to die.

Painfully.

And I cant blame her for killing Gordon. Who really could, given the circumstances? Part of me admires her greatly.

And I ate his fucking liver, too. 

So Im not in much of a position to judge. And Id like a friend

Whats your name? I ask her after she had gotten her fill of intestine.

I dont know why she responded this time. Lucy, she croaked, as though she had not spoken in a while.

Hi Lucy, Im Phil. It was awkwardly silent after that. 

How did you get here? I asked after some time. I have no idea how much time, really. It melts by in here.

My mother doesnt love me, she explained succinctly. 

Oh, was all I could think to respond. I dont think my mother loves me, either.

I might have fallen asleep, because I suddenly became aware again. I jerked forth in panic, and felt my body up and down for stab wounds.

There were none. Lucy was staring at me.

Ive never been so happy that a child had not shanked me in my sleep. But it did prove that I had to get moving on some sort of a plan. 

I had to get the knife.

How long have you been a prisoner, Lucy? I figured that staying on her conversational side would be advantageous no matter how this thing played out. 

I dont know. Most of my life, I think.

My heart sank. No wonder she had been so removed, so callous when it came to killing a grown man. She wasnt part of society in the way that the rest of us are, and didnt follow the same rules. 

For the first time since I saw the tapes, I realized that someone else was worse off than me. 

Thats horrible. Where were you kept?

My mom held me in a room in a tall apartment on Emmeline Street, she explained casually.

I knew the only tall apartment on that road.

Thats where my Aunt Myra lives, I offered, hoping for some sort of connection.

My moms name is Myra, Lucy explained casually.

My head swam. The possibility was impossible. The reality unreal.

But given how much had changed, I think I knew the truth right away.

No. No, no, no. My Aunt Myra doesnt have any. children. I trailed off.

Not any that has been in the outside world, she went on.

I had vertigo. The puzzle pieces of my life had fallen out and would never fit together, ever. Everything was wrong. 

I wanted to die then.

And I realized that that was the game. 

But maybe there could be a win. Maybe I could keep my cousin safe, and make my own death worthwhile. Just maybe, I could control some small part of what was happening.

I needed to act.

Lucy, I explained, Lucy, we have to do some hard things. But its for the best, I promise. You didnt hurt me when you could have, and that means something very special.

But I need you to give me the knife now.

Her face changed. Her expression steeled, and I could tell that a lifetime of abuse had prepared her to endure hard things.

She stiffened. 

I crawled across the cage toward her. You can trust me. Please. Im your family, and you can trust family, right? 

I stopped in front of her. I must have been a sight  naked, dirty, covered in the blood of the dead man next to us. I bet I stank like shit.

I smiled. Give me the knife, little girl.

I lunged at her. Despite the struggle, I knew it would be for the best. I might be able to use the knife to free us both. But even if I saved her by offering my body for food, I figured I could die content. But I had to end it on my terms.

She would eventually come to understand that I needed the knife. Keeping her alive meant holding on to the idea that right and wrong meant something; Mom could never take that away.

Her body was so tiny and frail. Im sure that she was malnourished. I reached around and yanked the knife toward me fairly easily, but she held on. 

She whimpered. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I realized that she must have felt betrayed, and I knew how sad it must have been that she was able to trust me just a little bit and lost it.

Clearly, trust was in short supply with Lucy. But I would give it back. Eventually.

I snatched the blade toward me one more time and she yanked back. Her eyes opened wide with shock and she looked down.

The knife had slipped six inches into her torso.

I reasoned very quickly. Hope of medical coverage? Zero. Chance of survival without it? Zero. Amount of suffering she would endure even if I tried to help her? Incalculable.

The sooner this was resolved, the better.

Instead of pulling the knife back toward me, I pushed even deeper. Blood gushed from Lucys mouth, and she stared at me in shock.

I tried to say, Im sorry, but for some reason nothing came out. We just locked eyes with one another.

I pulled the knife all the way out, grabbed her hair, and slit her throat. 

That was an hour ago. I cant bring myself to eat her, at least not yet. But Gordons body is getting pretty foul already, so I know theres a time constraint.

Its part of the game. 



UPDATE: I dont get much internet time; it seems that my connection is intentionally being turned on and off at planned intervals. To clarify, Lucys death was an accident. I decided that I would give my life for her if I could, but that I needed to be in control of the situation. Clearly, I explained it here as poorly as I did to her. My brain is becoming quite addled. After the accidental stabbing, all of my plans fell apart. I knew that I had to put her out of her misery as soon as possible.

Im so sorry, Lucy.

<TEXT> You cant unlove someone.

No matter how bad theyve been, it is impossible to break a bond that strong. You can test it, twist it, put it on trial for all the world to see. But that cannot break love. It will only serve to drag the person tethered to it through the most amazing trials of pain.

My son has been my world since we lost his father. He was an only child. I have just one sister, Myra, who has been a best friend to me as well. But theres nothing that can compare to what a mother shares with her son. 

So when I realized that I was going to lose him, it wasnt just changing part of my life. It meant erasing who I am, and re-writing an entirely new narrative that simply had no hope of comparing to the first. 

So I might as well have fun with it, right?

No, thats not a good way to explain what I knew I had to do. Theres no real sense of fun when going through the most agonizing part of life.

This pain will define who I am. So throughout it, as I undertake the task of synthesizing a new identity from the agonized ashes of my former self, I will take loving care to sculpt a meaningful identity. One that will bring me meaning and purpose. Perhaps one day even joy. 

I will not be crushed by defeat. I will turn loss into opportunity.

Dont judge me as one who fails to properly grieve. My son was going to die; that much was inevitable. He was starting a new life anyway, and had already cut ties with his previous one. Its fitting really, but also unspeakably tragic; he had just finished college, and a lifetime of hard work was about to start paying dividends.

But life can pivot on the slightest of happenstance. 

What future awaited him when he found out the truth about me? It would crush him and leave him alone. His life would bear the unending stain of shame. He would never be whole again. 

Im doing this because I loved him. I love him still. 

When he showed me the tapes that I thought were long buried, I knew it was over in an instant. I had thought of this day, but convinced myself that it would never be real. Yet here it was.

I hit him over the head with a cast iron skillet because I had to. I bound and shackled him because I had to. I sentenced him to die because I had to.

So why waste the opportunity? Dont act so high and mighty, readers. He was going to die anyway.

I have a unique mind. There are certain insatiable desires that are not far off of what most normal people feel, but which society judges in an unfairly harsh regard. Our collective morals are fluid and opportunistic. My mind is sharper, more adaptable, and, quite bluntly, more intelligent than that of the typical *homo sapiens*. There is justification ascribed suffering caused by humans throughout history. We revere slaveholders and torture animals with aplomb. We justify the mass killings of civilians during times of war. 

And I justify a little torture in time of peace.

Its not really that different, you see. Its a matter of perspective. 

And by allowing my release on a subject that was going to die anyway, Ive narrowed the effects of my practice.

It saddened me to lock my son up. My sister was there for me. She helped secure other subjects to place in the cage. 

Myra provided the little girl, obviously. I suppose trapping men has gotten blas. But hiding the knife in her shirt was all my idea. I think it worked itself out rather nicely. 

My son has already begun to undergo at transformation. Hes still writing, and it has enhanced my own experience to read it. Borrowing his username to add my own insight has brought me to near orgasmic levels. 

But nothing could surpass the experience of watching him eat that mans liver.

Oh, how I love watching. Its a high that nothing else can provide. Id love to measure my dopamine levels. I imagine doctors would be incredulous to find that I could achieve such a percentage without chemical assistance. 

The high lasted for a year after I watched the humanity drain from my husband. It helped me be a father and a mother to our lonely boy. 

It made the loss worthwhile.

Im hoping that it will work this time as well.

Because I know I will miss my son when hes gone.

Even after everything, I still did not expect this. I knew it would be extreme. But not this.

The other man woke up. His name is Gordon. Ive never seen him before, and have no way of knowing if Ive ever crossed paths with him in my previous life. The closest connection that I can seem to find is that he used to be neighbors with my moms sister Myra.

Is that important? I have no idea at this point.

He asked me directly if I had any idea why we might be here. I think I lied pretty convincingly. Other than establishing the fact that he lived near my aunt, I did nothing to implicate my mother in whats happening. 

Its not to protect her at this point. He may be lying, but I dont think he is. 

I just need to keep as many cards up my sleeve as I can right now. 

*(On the first day of kindergarten, I was too afraid to go into the classroom. I grabbed my mothers leg and did not let go. The teacher laughed, saying that many children are afraid at first. But she got progressively less understanding as I refused to let go. My mother finally had to take me home for the day, and I swore that I would never go back. But we had a talk, and she promised that she would always be there to rescue me if things got bad. That was the only thing that made me brave enough. I went to the second day of kindergarten, and every day after. I was never afraid to stay after that, because I always knew I could leave.)*

Gordon did not seem to grasp the full reality of our situation. It was for the best by my standards. We cannot get any other websites on this computer despite multiple attempts, and he seems to have no other advantageous skills. Lockpicking, engineering, logic  nothing.

Unless hes playing an elaborate psychological game with me. But if hes been doing a good job, Ill never know, right?
And I think the waters drugged.

We pass out shortly after drinking it, and when we wake up, its difficult to tell how much time has passed. 

But theres always more water.

Drink it or die.

Have you ever been unable to stop thinking about something? Imagine that the thought you cant expunge is that fact that you might have to kill an innocent person.

And eat them. 

Am I more justified in waiting until Im pushed to the edge? Or is it the same crime either way, meaning I should act now?

I dont think that Gordon has been processing the same thoughts. I may be a bad person for it, but the only thing that I can consider is that fact that this helps me. 

Im the strongest player in this game.

Things changed when we passed out the last time.

We woke up, and there were three of us. 

The new addition was a little girl. She had to have been about ten. She was thankfully dressed in a t-shirt and shorts, but looked far more haggard than either Gordon or I was at the time. I did not want to know what she had gone through. I did not ask. 

Had my mother done something horrible to her as well? I wracked my brain for justification that she hadnt, but I found none.

We spoke little after the immediate arrival. It was impossible to get much out of her, and after a few attempts at communication, we all fell into an uneasy silence. 

There is no way to measure the passage of time outside the computers clock, but Im beginning to doubt the accuracy of it. All I know is that time passed. 

The little girl was quick.

Of course neither Gordon nor I thought to pat her down for weapons. Who would? She whipped the knife out faster that I would have thought possible. 

I think she knew that Gordon was the weakest of us two. 

She worked at his neck in quick, shallow jabs. He was able to push her away, and she rolled into a corner. But it was too late.

Gordon grabbed at his neck as he convulsed to death. You know how movies always show a slick spy making quick work of an enemy agent?

Its all bullshit. The human body does not want to die, and fights all the way to the end.

There was gurgling, and sputtering, and a lot of convulsing. After the end, Gordon did a LOT of twitching. 

But he sure as shit was dead.

It did not even dawn on me to intervene until long after it was over. The girl still had the knife, and she was not finished yet. 

When it was clear that Gordon was dead, she descended upon him.

Like a hunter over its prey, she made quick work of his torso. She was pulling out his organs. 

I had to think.

She was probably starved. Food would help her get ahead. She was capable of killing. Soon Id be pushed to starvation. Wed likely go a long time without food. The more she had, the more danger I was in. 

Put it all together, people.

When she pulled the liver out, I did what I had to do. Im a lot stronger than a ten-year-old girl. I whipped it from her, and took it for myself. I figure that the sooner I adapt to the unthinkable, the more likely I am to make it out of here.

So I ate Gordons liver.  It was chewy, cold, and gamey. But I hadnt eaten in a day, and I was hungry. 

I continued eating unabated, because I had to. And the blood poured freely down my chin. 

I did not take the knife. I let it go because I convinced myself that I could snatch it away, just like the liver, at any point I wish. That justification is easier than confronting the reality that when she loses the knife, she will know that she will die from it. 

I just cant handle that reality right now.

Ive decided to deal with the mental implications later. The rest gets pushed to the back of my mind for the moment. 

The girl got to eat less. For now, shes sitting at the back of the cage, not moving.

I know she has the knife. She knows that I know it. 

And we both know this game has been taken to the next level.

<TEXT> That was. a terrible idea.

You can read about how I got to this point [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/68kifc/wtf/).

She was my mom. Nothing could break the bond. Even if she had made a terrible mistake years ago, it was nothing we couldnt overcome together.

Right?

When she got home, I told her right away that we needed to talk. If she suspected what I had found, her expression betrayed nothing. 

I wasnt sure what to say. Finally, I told her, I found this, and produced the VHS tape.

Her expression started to crack, and she gave a few gasping sobs.

I think.

I was going to tell her how things would be okay, that we could work through it. Of course, there was anger swirling around in the back of my mind  there had been all day  but I refused to accept what I saw as real. 

I tried reasoning with myself, justifying evidence, doing everything I could to get around the reality of having watched my dads final cannibalistic moments.

So I never really dealt with what I saw.

Bad idea.

I woke up a while ago on the floor. I dont know where this room is, or what happened between then and now.

But Im in a chain-link cage, Im naked, and Im pretty sure Im underground.

Not good. 

I still refused to accept what was happening. So I called for my mom. I was naked, terrified, and the top of my head throbbed like it had been hit pretty hard. In retrospect, it was one of the lowest points of my life. I was naked and afraid, and I was calling out for the last person I was with. In that moment, I needed my mother more than anything. 

*Im flashing back to being six years old. My dad had been gone less than a year. It was my mom who taught me to ride a two-wheeler. I started getting pretty good, but I fell. Hard. I cried and cried for her, and somehow she knew to find me a block away. She picked me up and cradled me, giving that soothing sh sh sh tone that only mothers can give. In that moment, I felt like everything would be okay again, for the first time since my dad disappeared.*

The memory stood in such painful contrast to where I was now. The only thing that my brain could grasp is that my mom would make this better, and absolutely nothing else would.

Then I saw the camera.

It all fell apart in that moment, and I stopped calling for my mom in mid-yell. The camera, an old, VHS dinosaur of a machine, was sitting on a tripod and pointed directly at me. I deflated when I realized that it was at the exact angle the previous camera must have been, all those years ago. 

She was making another video.

All illusion ended in an instant. What I saw was real, my dads fate had been real, and what was about to happen to me was very, very real. 

The only tool I have with me is my laptop. And nearly every website is blocked.

All of the evidence points to the fact that someone found what I wrote, and, for some reason, wants me to keep writing. 

This is a game.

I dont understand why my mother is doing this to me. I dont know if its possible to escape. Is that part of the game? To find a way out? Or is the idea simply to engineer suffering?

It turns out that we dont really know the people in our lives, not even the closest ones. Our inner thoughts are so personal that only a tiny fraction actually bridges the gap to the rest of humanity.

I wrote before about how everyone has a million tiny connections that link us all.

I dont believe that anymore.

Things are about to get very, very bad. When I close my eyes, all I can see is the video of my fathers last torturous days (weeks? months?) 

And then I open my eyes, and I cant escape the fact that Im here.

Theres no point in asking for help. I have no idea where I am. There are no windows in this room, and the floor is dirt, so Im likely underground. Based on the elaborate preparation, its pretty obvious that this computer was only left to me after someone made sure there was no way that I could use it to ask for help.

I write someone because its still to hard for me to say the truth. Because beyond all the fear and hurt, the feeling thats coming through the strongest is sadness. 

Even if I survive this, what will I have left? My mom is basically my only family. I was just about start a new life, which means that I have already left the last one behind.

Theres one more thing.

Im not alone in this cell. Theres an man in here with me whom Ive never met. Hes naked and unconscious. 

I dont think hes here to help me escape. Because I saw the video, and I know why there are two people in this cell. 

Im not looking forward to what comes next. Or how long it will take. But I suppose its part of the grand plan to take all of you along for the ride, so youll know soon enough.

Though I have been thinking about it. Ive been unable to stop my brain from trying to process it all. I believe now that the design of this cage is to draw out the inevitable change, to allow the watcher to savor each step. And the steps will all be there. Anyone suffering long enough will abandon, one by one, the most precious things they believe. Its inevitable.

Its what binds us as humans.

Theres one edge I have though. Just one.

I saw the first video. I know what to expect, what were about to go through.

That will give me a certain advantage.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Im 22. My dad disappeared when I was five. Fucked up, right?

It turns out that our definition of fucked up is limited by just how much life has decided to crush us. 

Its been just me and my mom ever since. Flashes of memory and fleeting emotions, undoubtedly marred by the flow of time, are all that I have left of my dad. I figured my apathy was his penance for leaving. 

So I lived with Mom until I graduated college. She was the only one there for me.

I felt kind of guilty taking a job in Nashville and leaving her halfway across the country, but she understood. She always did. 

It meant moving away from the only home I could remember, though. It was surreal enough packing up our house; it was as though I was disassembling the foundations of existence itself, pulling apart things that I did not know could be undone. 

Thats when I found the videos. 

We never realize just how much stuff we own. Its because when we move past a certain phase in our lives, we think that the material possessions disappear as well. 

Think about that last part long and hard. Do it now.

Some bells cannot be unrung, and some fires cannot be unburned.

I was digging through the endless possessions in our attic. I did not realize how much of myself had been left behind, how living means turning part of yourself into a ghost, until I dug through it all.

It was in an unassuming box.

There were three VHS tapes in there. They were all unlabeled. 

The digging made me nostalgic. My mom wasnt around at the moment, so I couldnt ask her about it. 

It wasnt hard to find and old VCR and an even older TV in the attic. To my surprise, they worked on the first try.

I put the video in. 

Fire lit.

The screen showed a poorly-lit room. You can instantly tell from those old VHS tapes when youre looking at a home video, and not a movie.

This was not a movie. 

There were two men crouching in the corner of a cage. They were naked.

One was my dad.

I could tell he was on the verge of tears. He glanced up, gave a desperate look to the camera, and shuffled forward. He made a pleading gesture with his hands, and the video cut out.

It was quickly replaced with another scene. The angle was identical, and it never shook, so it was clearly sitting on some sort of a tripod.

My dad was on his knees in front of the camera. When he looked up, I nearly puked. He was still naked and caked in dirt. His frame had become much more skeletal, and he was openly weeping. I could hear his sobs. 

Then he began to speak.

Pleeee-ee-eease, he begged through the tears. The other man in the cage, also naked and dirty, rolled silently back and forth in the corner. Please, dont, he wheezed through gasping sobs. Please, Nancy.

Gravity shifted. Nancy is my mom.

He continued to pump his interlocked fingers up and down in front of him in a begging motion. Ive never seen a human look so miserable.

The video cut out again. When it started up, it was of the same scene.

Clearly, time had passed.

He was more gaunt than ever. My father and the man next to him sat utterly transfixed, staring at the camera with empty eyes. I began to wonder if the tape had stopped, or if they were dead. Then my father leapt forward and started growling. He grabbed the chain-link bars of the cage in a white-knuckle grip. He started chewing on it.

The video cut out one more time. When it came back in again, my father was sitting on his haunches. He was no longer looking at the camera. Instead, his face was pitched forward, stuffed with something that he was eating. It was oozing through his fingers.

The liquid was so dark that at first I did not realize it was blood.

My father was eating ravenously, as though he had long been starved. As he was chewing, he slowly pivoted his head around and looked into the camera.

I dont know how to describe what I saw. When a person looks at you, theres a humanity that can neither be denied nor described. You know, based on what you see, that the person behind the eyes is interpreting the world around them in a million tiny ways that links them back to you.

His eyes had none of that.

He looked at the camera the same way that youd stare at a sign in a foreign language. Or a purple sunset. Fuck, I dont know. Something that wasnt sharing the world with you.

He continued chewing unabated. The blood poured freely down his chin.

It was only then that I realized the other man was no longer in the cage.

And here I am in the attic, seventeen years later.

Which brings me to a very important question: precisely what in the blue fuck do I do?



UPDATE:

Ive decided to come clean to my mom that I found the tapes. Shell be home in a couple of hours. I want to give her a chance to explain herself before I show them to the police or anyone else. I mean, shes my mom, right? Whats the worst that could happen? Doesnt she deserve at least a chance to explain whats going on? What do you guys think?

**Lacys Story**

Four years after I discovered the truth about my son was the worse day of my life.

Casey was the classic good kid as a young boy, but he started to slip in high school. I found out who he really was when I had to bail him out of jail a week after his high school graduation. 

Despite my wishes, he did not go to college.

He would disappear for longer and longer periods after that. It tore me apart to watch my only son unravel in front of my eyes. I blamed myself, I blamed Casey, I blamed the husband that lost a battle to cancer when our son was five. I had tried helping him, paying for rehab, yelling at him, pleading with him, crying to him, slapping him, kicking out, welcoming him home, and doing nothing.

In the beginning, I wanted desperately to know where he would go when he disappeared. As time wore on, I realized that I really didnt want to know at all. 

When the police called me the last time, I could tell right away that the tone was different. Part of me knew immediately; part of me had known that this outcome was predetermined, and that only the timing was left to fate.

I didnt cry when they opened up a drawer in a chilly morgue. His body was badly mangled, but it was my son. I caressed his twenty-two year old face for the last time, but felt mild surprise that I could do so with a certain academic detachment. I felt a stress behind my eyes, and vaguely realized that my mind was going through a seismic fissure. Something deep was breaking  not in my world, but in myself. It was too fundamental to be addressed with something as pedestrian as tears.

The next days were hard to distinguish from one another. It took nearly a week for me to realize that I was adjusting to life without hope, and that had changed my lifes trajectory. I decided to test that theory.

I found myself standing on the edge of a bridge. Below me was the place that I had first gone to pick up an unconscious Casey. At the time, I had not known whether he had passed out from drugs or violence. It took another year for me to realize that there wasnt a difference. 

It was on the edge of that bridge, wondering what fate lay below, when I finally cracked. I screamed, and thats the last that I remembered before the Change.

I found that I was still standing, but in a different place. A man sat in front of me, foot tucked up near his waist, elbow resting on his knee, a long, thin cigarette in his left hand. His sandy brown hair looked unkempt in an intentional sort of way. The collar of his trench coat was flipped up too high in an irritating sort of way. 

To be perfectly honest, Lacy, even I didnt think that it would end up like this. He turned his eyes toward me; they were a cobalt blue. I thought he would go for the boy. He took a deep drag contemplatively, then let it out with a soft sigh. A man once told me Theres no point in saying what Im looking for  my most valued possessions are all things I never knew I needed at first. Well, I suppose theres a mirror of that on the other side as well. The saddest things I see are the unexpected.

He sat quietly for a moment, the smoke gathering in the air above him. His cigarette stayed long. 

Why am I here? I didnt know why I asked the question, but did not really care, either. Not anymore.

The man held the cigarette between his index and middle fingers and pointed his hand in my direction. Lacy Delora, aged forty-six, current denizen of a curious bridge, I will show you something different from either your shadow at morning striding behind you, or your shadow at evening rising to meet you.

He leapt down from his perch, revealing a doorframe behind him. There was no wall in which it resided; it was simply a freestanding edifice.

Doors are kind of my thing, the man smiled. Come take a look.

I took three steps forward and he pulled it open. 

The other side of the door led somewhere impossible. It was a grassy median of a busy thoroughfare, outdoors and noisy. But the door was in the middle of an otherwise empty room. 

My confusion quickly dissipated when I saw what was on the other side.

Casey!

I sprinted at the door, but bounced off of it, as though an invisible wall held me back.

Ah, ah, ah, the man said. This is a seeing door, not a changing door. All this already happened. Whatever happens can never be undone. Thats the most important rule. He put his cigarette back into his mouth. Sorry, I guess I should have explained that. 

He didnt seem too sorry, but I hardly seemed to notice.

I watched in horror as my son  looking worse than ever  lurched, slightly stumbling, across the median. He had an evil look on his face, almost lecherous, and I realized with horror that he was advancing on an oblivious man. I could see what he was about to do, and wondered with terror if one of them would kill the other, and did not know which way to hope.

I gasped as another man, from seemingly nowhere, dashed forth and lunged at Casey. My son pulled a knife, but it was too late.

I knew what I was about to see, but could not turn away. 

The collision was mortifying. My son was tossed like a rag doll up into the air, and bounced twice on the ground. Three more cars ran him over without stopping before traffic ground to a halt. No one else seemed to get hurt, but I my attention was elsewhere. 

All I could think about was that I wished Id jumped before seeing my sons death.

Why? I whispered. Why would you do this?

The man slowly closed the door. It clicked shut.

Because, he actually sounded sympathetic this time, it was unfair. You never had a choice. You couldnt have known that Caseys after-school tutoring sessions were where he first got introduced to substance abuse. Even he didnt know that he was depressed, and youre not a mind-reader. And he made the wrong choice at every turn through his own volition. And you

Here he looked genuinely sad. 

You didnt even have a choice in his pregnancy. He was quiet. But you loved him just the same, didnt you? You- here he opened the door again, never got to choose.

The scene behind him was different this time.

There was a short hallway, with a man napping in the corner.

I recognized him. It was the man who killed Casey. 

This, my mysterious host now handed me a .22 caliber pistol, IS a changing door.

I stepped through it. He followed.









**Jakes Story**


I awoke to the snap of a gun clip.

I looked up blearily from his uncomfortable nap. Janus was not much of a host; but when I was offered the chance to sleep in a dingy hallway, I reasoned that it would still be the least bizarre thing to happen to me today. I had suddenly felt a wave of sleepiness, and was quickly out.

Now there were two people in front of me. Janus was closing the rooms only door behind him, while a frail woman who looked to be about sixty stood looking down at me. 

She was the one holding the gun. 

Um.. hi? I propped myself up on my elbows.

Before this happens, she nearly whispered, you have to know who I am.

My mind raced as I slowly climbed to my feet. I looked to Janus for help, but he stood stoically in front of the door, arms folded, omnipresent cigarette clenched by thin lips.

Janus this is not what I chose

You chose to kill Casey! the woman was suddenly shrieking. 

I am  confused. Please maam, the gun, put it down. I dont know a Casey. Im a stranger here myself.

I watched you throw my son in to traffic!

Shit.

To be honest, I had been wallowing in the sense of being a do-gooder. I really had thought Id beaten the system, had tricked the trickster and saved two lives at no cost. 

In retrospect, I could see how murdering an anonymous criminal might have consequences. 

The woman was advancing slowly toward me. Okay, I thought, youve beaten the odds once. Piece of cake.

She was trembling, the barrel of the gun in constant motion. She reminded me for a fleeting moment of the man (boy?) I had tossed into traffic, and how fragile he had seemed.

Maam, listen, please. You may not believe me, but I swear whatever you saw was NOT me. I was advancing slowly, almost imperceptibly, never breaking eye contact. I dont know what happened to your son, but I just lost my wife. It was hurtful beyond what I thought I the limits of pain were. It got better when- 

I suddenly snapped my gaze over her shoulder in the direction of Janus, who was quite still.

She turned her head around, immediately and unconsciously, just as I reasoned a highly stressed person would do.

She fell backward easily, just like her son did. It was easy to take the gun from her hand.

The woman shot up immediately. I flashed glances between her and Janus, the latter of whom was still standing motionlessly, smoke enwreathing his head again.

She had a crazed look plastered on her face, and something knowing flashed behind her eyes.

Janus would be no help. This was all about choices, wasnt it? She chose to come here, and she was choosing not to walk away

The woman began to walk toward me. I slowly began to step back.

Dont move! I aimed the gun at her head and held a steady hand. Stay right there! my voice trembled even if my hand did not. 

What the fuck was I going to do? This woman obviously came into the room with the intent of murdering me. She found me in my sleep. She wouldnt even back down when I had a gun pointed at her face. I would never be safe as long as she was alive.

My back bumped against the wall.

Last chance. I stood fixed; so did she. For a moment, neither one of us wavered.

I didnt have a choice. Right?

I pulled the trigger. It clicked. 

I pulled several more times. Nothing. 

The woman closed the final step separating us and took the gun in a nearly maternal way. My troubled son forced me to involve myself with worse things than this, she explained, holding the gun out to her side. During that time, I became more than familiar enough with guns to know how to unload a clip and clear a chamber.

I was locked in place, thunderstruck.

I gave you an gun, she went on, her voice just beginning to crack, to give you a choice. So that you would know the weight of being a mother. Of having a life in your hands. She released the hint of a forlorn gasp. I made sure the gun was empty so that, no matter what you chose, you would get to live with your decision. 

She threw the pistol violently to the ground. My hell is that as long as I walk on this earth, I will never escape the fact that I could not save my son. Yours is the fact that you have to live with what you were going to do to me. You chose to pull the trigger when I was unarmed. You would have been just as safe if you had let the gun fall. The only difference is what you did to yourself.

She turned and walked gracefully away. 

She made it thirteen steps before collapsing into a crouch on the ground. The cracks in the dam finally won; every tear she had held back started to spill. 

I was sick. I had the gnawing thought in the back of my mind that the past minute would change me in a way that could never be fixed. My knees wobbled.

Janus locked eyes with me, but continued to stay silent. 

I realized vaguely that I had yet another choice in front of me. 

I slowly walked forward, taking care to step over the discarded pistol. I advanced on the hunched-over woman, who was now shaking with all of the frailty and fragility that I had initially ascribed to her. 

I sat down and wrapped my arms around the mother of the man I had killed. She grabbed my torso with such ferocity that I thought she was attacking me after all. But she rocked back and forth instead, heaving gasping sobs as she did so. I rocked with her, too empty for tears.

Janus let us sit in silence for some time. When the woman had quieted, he smiled. 

Theres nothing left in this hallway, he explained, turning around to grab the doorknob. Now lets see whats behind door number three.

<TEXT> I suppose its really hit the fan when I have to go to anonymous internet strangers for help. But I have no choice. For reasons that will be pretty fucking apparent, I cant turn to anyone I know or tell you my name. 

I can say that Im a thirty six-year-old single mom with a five-year-old daughter. Her name is Eliza May. Its about her.

Shes always been my shining star. Youve heard all of the same crap  my child is amazing, beautiful, talented, blah, blah, blah, youll understand when youre a parent. 

Then you become a parent. And you do understand.

There is nothing in life to compare with the feeling of fearing for your child. When I stop to consider what I would actually do to keep her safe, my own answers horrify me.

All of those were hypotheticals until last week.

I noticed something odd when I walked by Eliza May sitting in front of the TV. Something was just slightly off. The way that she was kneeling, and her proximity to the screen, did not seem right. 

The news anchor brought me out of my reverie. 

Carlton Maston is a twenty four-year-old white male. He was last seen at the Chong Industries Warehouse two nights ago. A severed hand was recovered at the scene; investigators have confirmed that the hand belongs to Maston. Authorities suspect foul play. Anyone with information is encouraged to contact [city] police immediately.

I looked back at Eliza May to find her smiling. It was not just a grin; she was positively beaming. I could see every single one of her teeth. She held that position for a moment, seemingly enraptured by the TV. When she rotated her head and fixed her gaze on me  still unblinking, still so toothy  my daughter made me shudder for just the second time in my life. I left the room.

Things continued to be mostly normal. I debated with her about why we could not have a pony come live with us, why she had to go to kindergarten (every single day with this one), and why princess costumes did not count as normal clothing. 

The debate about dinner three nights ago was weird. 

I brought home some steaks to cook on the stove. I suppose Eliza May is as picky as any other five-year-old when it comes to food. But she got upset about something that I never expected.

Were having steaky, Mom?

Steak. Yes, honey. It will be ready in a few minutes, as soon as I cook it.
She got her Im-about-to-cry face.

Mooom, no, she whined. Dont.

Dont what, sweetie? I asked, distracted by the salt I had just knocked over.

Dont cook it. I want it bloody. She looked up at me with those angelic eyes and smiled.

I  what? I stopped what I was doing and turned toward her.

I want it bloody, she explained simply, her normal dimpled cherub grin in place.

I, uh  no, we have to cook it.

Her face held the glowing smile for just a second before a shadow crept over it.

But I want it BLOODY! She shrieked the last word in that pitch that only small children can reach.

I stared at her as she began to cry. 

I wont, I wont, you cant make me, EEEEEE! She stamped her foot down hard on the ground, tearing her yellow Belle dress in the process. 

She went to bed without any dinner that night. 

I tried to shake it off. Kids say the damnedest things, right? Their brains are brand-new and still warming up. 

Nothing of further note happened until two nights ago.

Now I explained that I am a single mom, which affects everything about how I see safety. Every door to the outside has three locks. Eliza May and I have a safe word. I sleep with a baseball bat by my bed. 

And I always worry. 

So when I heard something distinctly moving around in my living room, I nearly shit the bed.

I have a kid to protect. So in a situation where I would have otherwise jumped out the window and started running, I did just the opposite.

I went into the dark. 

With only my baseball bat in hand, I crept silently through the hall. I didnt turn on a single light; I wanted to get the drop on whoever or whatever was roaming around the living room. I had to find it before it found my daughter. 

I got to the edge of the living room and felt the light switch with my fingertips, but held back on flicking it.

Whatever was in the room had not reacted to my presence. I waited with my breath held.

It continued to walk  to march, almost. It was pacing in circles, I realized. It did two full circuits of the living room as I stood there silently.

When it traveled to the far end of the room for a third time, I decided to flip the switch. 

There was Eliza May, parading boisterously around the edge of the rug, swinging her arms and lifting her knees high. She trailed a dog leash behind her. It was not tied to any thing, and slithered along behind her in an empty sort of way.

The fucking weirdest thing, though, was her eyes. When I flipped the switch, she was ALREADY looking at me, as though she could see me in the dark. She maintained eye contact with each swinging step as she marched around the room, never saying a word. That open-mouthed, toothy grin sat plastered on her face the whole time.

I was sure she had been following me with her eyes before I ever arrived in the room. 

I stumbled over my words for about ten seconds before I was finally able to blurt out, what the fuck are you doing?

It just came. I never swear in front of my daughter. But seriously. What the fuck?

She gave three more silent swinging steps. At first I thought she wasnt going to answer. 

Im giving Penelope a walk! she explained in a saccharine sort of way.

Penelope was the golden retriever that I had years ago. She died before Eliza May was born; I had never told my daughter about her, or shown her any pictures. Penelope had been run over by a truck and not died for ten minutes. It was so traumatic that I never wanted to have or speak of another pet ever again. 

There is absolutely no way that she could have known that name. 

I was holding back tears as I ushered her back to her bedroom. I could feel her staring and grinning at me the whole time we walked, but I refused to return her gaze. I simply grabbed her left hand with mine, placed my right hand on her back, and looked forward as we walked.

When I had put her to bed I picked up the pink leash that she dropped on the floor. There was no nametag. But Im sure it was Penelopes.

I had thrown in in the trash after she died.

Im quite certain that Eliza May was staring at me through the walls after I climbed back into my own bed. 

Even that was bearable.

Last night I woke up in what had to be the middle of the night. I dont actually remember awakening. But I knew that something wasnt right. 

Someone was with me. 

I scrambled to find the pull chain to my bedside lamp. Light flooded the room, casting more shadows than illumination. 

I shrieked when I saw a face on the pillow next to mine. 

Eliza May was standing by the side of the bed, leaning forward and resting her chin on the pillow. For some reason, she was fully dressed. 

I lurched back in fright. 

Eliza, w- what are you doing here? 

She was smiling, but it was her normal, dimpled cherub grin. I was relieved to see that, at least. 

She leaned close and put a finger over her lips in an exaggerated kind of way.

Sssshhhhh  its in the freezer! Dont tell anybody! she pulled her head back and clapped her hands twice, still grinning. Then she turned and started skipping away. Not running, not walking, but skipping. 

She stopped when she was halfway to my bedroom door. Her face was much more sinister in the elongated shadows.

Remember, she stated very matter-of-factly, no hint of a grin this time, dont tell. Anybody.

She smiled again, and then skipped out the door.

I must have lay in a cold sweat for an hour. What do I do? How do I protect my daughter from  my daughter? I was afraid for her, afraid of her, afraid to stay in place, afraid to move. 

The mind can play amazing tricks on itself. I eventually convinced myself that this was unusual, sure, but nothing to be really worried about. Kids say the damnedest things, after all. 

I decided to check the freezer so that I could prove to myself that everything was in my head. I was simultaneously nervous, embarrassed, and ashamed of myself for needing proof that my daughter was not doing something sinister. How could I need reassurance?

And how could I gather the strength to open the freezer door by myself, in the dark?

I walked to the kitchen and positioned myself in front of it. I stood for a minute in the dark, deciding that the freezer light would be best in a dark kitchen, allowing it to illuminate every crevice and put my fears to rest. 

I rested my hand on the door, took a deep breath, and opened it.

Nothing but frozen peas. 

I actually laughed at myself, and rested my head in the open cavity as I chuckled. How could I have ever been nervous about this? I was a rare specimen.

Something hit my head and drizzled down my neck. I instinctively reached back and pulled it in front of my eyes. 

Just ice. 

I chuckled, rolled my eyes, and shut the door. 

I was slightly delirious with relief. How could I have been so worked up? I laughed. Eliza May isnt even tall enough to reach the freezer door! Thats why I keep her popsicles in there. Anything I expect her to reach

Is in the top-opening chest freezer we keep in the garage. 

I was halfway up the stairs when I decided that I had to check it. Not because I thought that there was something inside, but just so I could sleep. It was a mental trick that I would play on myself to put this all behind me. 

Besides, the first freezer had been easy enough. This one would be, too. 

I put on my slippers and quickly trotted into the brisk night air. I wanted to get this over with as soon as possible so that I could get back into my warm bed. 

I did turn on the light this time, because theres no illumination in the chest freezer. I regretted it, however; the garage light was a single bulb that hung from a twelve-foot ceiling. The only effect that it really had was to point out how many different hiding places existed in my chilly and underused garage. 

I shook it off an approached the freezer. It had a small knob that attached to a door, which could lift off the top entirely. 

I grabbed it and pulled. 

The frozen face inside was locked in terror. It was clear that he must have died in the throes of agony, carrying immense pain up until the very moment of death. 

His legs were contorted around him like an insect, a necessary adjustment to make him fit into the freezer. 

I stood motionless. I simply could not force myself to move. This predicament put me in the unfortunate position of absorbing every detail. 

Down to the oozing stump where his right hand should have been.

I rocked back and forth in the corner of the garage for an unknown time. I was mortified by the body, but to be perfectly honest, I was even more terrified of what was waiting for me back in the house. 

Ive gone over this issue in my head more times than I can count. The simple reality, Ive concluded, is that I have to leave the body there for now. Trying to move it will inevitably attract attention, and contacting the authorities will either get my precious daughter justifiably accused (less likely), or me unjustifiably in a world of trouble (much more probable).

So here I am, internet. Its daylight now, my daughter is humming to herself and coloring in the next room  acting completely normal - and I dont know what to do. 

Short of cannibalism, that is, which is rapidly seeming like the least crazy option.

<TEXT> One week and three days after his wifes death was the worst day of Jake Millers life.

Its a survival mechanism that our minds cannot absorb shock all at once. The most poignant moments would be so great at their best that the rest of life would lose its luster; at the worst, fate would crush us in an instant.

Hypertrophic heart disease literally took her overnight. The next days were filled with wary friends and family staring wide-eyed at him as though he would explode at any moment. It wouldnt happen, though, at least not yet. Their surreal behavior around him kept her death in a far-off realm, one where everyday rules didnt apply, and where the normal order would be restored in due haste.

One week and three days later was the first night that no one brought over any food. The funeral had passed with all due solemnity, his wife lay in the ground, and there were no immediate plans to be made. Jake watched TV and ate dinner alone. 

This would be the new normal.

His head got suddenly hot, and the screaming began all at once. The unfairness of it all. He had been happy. Just last month (he longed for last month), he and his wife had returned a toaster to Target, because it didnt work, and that had to be fixed. 

Why was the toaster guaranteed when his world was not?

The screaming reached a fever pitch, and his head felt like it was going to explode. And then it was dark. 

Jake had no memory of waking up. He was just there. Same salmon-colored shirt, same jeans with the tiny ink stain, same cowlicked hair that had been a byproduct of decreased grooming standards over the past ten days. 

The man in front of him was new.

He was lean, nearly gaunt, and held the hint of a smirk without grinning. The sandy blonde hair was untamed but balanced. He wore a dark trench coat with the collar flipped up far too high. A lit cigarette was perched delicately between his thumb and forefinger, the smoke lazily enwreathing his head. 

Why am I here? Jake was surprised at his own question. He didnt ask where he was or how hed gotten there, but those queries seemed secondary at the moment. 

The mans hint of a grin grew into a genuine one. Well, Jake, why are you angry?

He blurted his answer before he had time to think. Because I didnt have a fucking choice! Once again, his own response surprised him, but it seemed to fit.

And thats why youre here, Jake. He pivoted his head and locked him in with his sky-blue eyes. Is it the worst thing possible? Not to have a choice? Isnt there comfort in resignation?

He struggled to answer. Jake finally decided to let the words come on their own. Who are you?

He gave half a chuckle. Oh, Ive had many names. He took a long drag from the cigarette. A name is nothing more than how other people see you. Its your choice to accept it or not. He looked down contemplatively at what he was smoking, and Jake noticed vaguely that it had not seemed to get any shorter. For the moment, you can call me Janus. Ive always liked that one.

Jake struggled to speak again, and realized that he couldnt because he was trying too hard. He relaxed again. It this real, or is it a dream?

Janus pinched the near end of the cigarette and pointed at Jake with spindly fingers. All dreams are real. Otherwise we wouldnt have them. His eyes were piercing. They happen. Whatever happens can never be undone. Thats the most important rule. He paused, took a drag, and let it slowly out his nostrils. The cigarette still did not shrink in size. But to answer your question  were in between. That will have to suffice for now. But! he nearly shouted. Never underestimate the consequences of what happens inside your head. Everything you will ever know happens inside your mind. He labored to punctuate these last few words.

He leapt down, and only then did Jake notice that he had been casually squatting on an unseen perch. It had somehow seemed to unimportant to notice before then.

Now, Janus went on, placing the cigarette back in his mouth, you couldnt live without a choice. It bobbed up and down as it dangled precariously from his lips. Lets see if you can live with one. He grabbed Jake by the collar with both hands.

Noise. Traffic, specifically, and rushing wind. It was twilight, and they were on the median of a busy thoroughfare. 

Listen carefully, Jake, Janus spoke above the din. Over there, he pointed over Jakes right shoulder, is a careless boy of about six. In a little under thirty seconds, hes going to get hit by a distracted driver from over there, he jerked his thumb over his own left shoulder. It will kill him instantly.

He put his arm around Jakes back and turned around to face the same direction. Over here, we have a meth head.

It was clear who Janus saw. Skeletal thin and ghostly pale, the man emitted wrongness. He was standing thirty feet away on the median, but apparently oblivious to their presence. He, Janus continued, is about to kill John Miller, aged thirty, walking to the gas station across the street after a long day at work. He will take nineteen dollars and thirteen cents from Mister Miller, who will die slowly of stab wounds.

And that car, he said, pointing to a white Mercedes weaving through traffic, will prevent you from saving both.

And Janus was gone.

Jake was completely frozen.

And then the spell was broken.

Jake turned away from where the boy was wandering carelessly toward traffic and sprinted toward the meth head. He looked up in paranoia, and withdrew a mean-looking Bowie knife from seemly nowhere.

Jake dove low and wrapped his arms around the mans waste. He was frail, almost fragile, and Jake spun him easily. 

Hed only have one shot at this.

Jake tiled toward the curb and hurled the meth head toward the street. The white Mercedes weaved from the far lane to the near one. 

It contacted him, and launched the man six feet into the air. 

The car fishtailed and drove up onto the median. 

It stopped well short of the boy. And John Miller, whose mind was on the Power Bar he was about to buy, had safely crossed the street before becoming vaguely aware of the commotion he had just bypassed.

Jake once again found himself alone with Janus, who was eyeing him with something between fear and admiration. So, he drawled, youre one of those people.

Jake was panting. I want, he gasped, to save my wife.

Janus regarded him for a long moment. Whatever happens can never be undone, he articulated slowly, thats the most important rule.

Jake winced in agony. So shes  gone? he whimpered. 

Gone? Janus blinked. No, shes not gone. Shes dead. Surely someone of your - predispositions - must realize that things are complicated.

Jake continued to pant, dropping his hands to his knees. I  I just want to be able to do something. Anything.

Jake, he explained slowly, you just killed a stranger. Do you really think you dont have the ability to change the world?

Jake looked up from the floor. I want to change my world. I dont want it anymore.

Janus looked strange. After a second, Jake realized that its because he was sad. 

Okay, Jake, he let out a forceful stream of smoke from his nostrils. Just remember the most important rule.

I will.

No. People never do. Now follow me.

<TEXT> Theyve always been among us.

Every society in human history has kept human figurines in their presence. Theres a reason for it; but ask ten different people and youll get ten different reasons why we do so.

In the summer of 1868, the Kolmer family lived in a cabin on what was then Minnesota frontier land. Mr. and Mrs. Kolmer had just one child; Addie was eight years old. 

When her grandmother visited that summer, she brought Addie the gift of a small figurine, eighteen inches tall, with cobalt blue eyes.

Mama, I dont like this girl. She looks at me.

Addie, her mother scolded. It was a gift.

Shes right, Addie, her father said sternly. Besides, she looks so much like you. The same blonde hair, shes even got a red dress just like yours.

Papa, I dont like her. And my eyes are brown. Shes not like me at all.

Her mother picked up the figurine and brought it into Addies bedroom, setting in on the bureau facing the bed. It stays here, and thats final, she said, placing her hands on her hips.


The next morning, Addie came to the breakfast table looking haggard. 

Whats wrong, Addie? her father asked. Why are those brown eyes so red?

Addie turned a bloodshot look toward him. She says she wants my eyes. 

Her mother laid two bowls of steaming oatmeal in front of Addie and her father. What do you mean, Ad?

The girl swiveled her reddened eyes to her mother. I couldnt sleep. It only talks in the quiet. She opens my ears when I close my eyes.

Her mother hardened. If this is about your grandmothers gift, Ill have none of it. Its in your room, and shes staying there.



The next morning, Addie looked even worse. She kept dropping her eyelids and nearly falling into her oatmeal, but would catch her self with an abrupt jerk of the head every time. Upon waking, she would glance around as though terrified. 

Her father placed a hand on her shoulder. Whats going on now, Dee? Are you sleepy?

She whipped a bloodshot glance at him before dropping her eyes again. Addie snapped awake. She uses she uses the quiet for words. Dori, Ori, Laso, Laso. Dori Ori Laso Laso. 

Her eyelids fell in place and stayed there for five seconds. When they shot open again, she sprang out of the chair, wiped her hands on her red dress, and sprinted out the door into the sunlight. Mr. Kolmer raised his eyebrows in concern at his wife; she crossed her arms and remained stoic. 


At night, they heard it too. It was far too aggressive to be a whine, too mirthy to be a growl. Mr. and Mrs. Kolmer raced from their beds and sprinted toward their daughters door. Mr. Kolmer grasped the knob furiously and pulled on it, but could not overcome the resistance. 

The door had no lock. 

Addie screamed from the other side of the door  not a loud scream, because people only scream loudly when they have hope of being saved. She screamed because it was impossible to express herself through tears alone. 

Theres no window on that side of the cabin! Mr. Kolmer yelled, his knuckles white, eyes wide and wild. We have to open this door!

There was an odd splashing sound from the other side. Mrs. Kolmer wailed.

Mr. Kolmer sprinted outside the door while his wife tugged fruitlessly at the knob. She collapsed in sobs, pawing weakly at the wooden frame.

Tears of blood, crying tears of blood. They were the first clear words from the other side of the door. It sounded very much like Addie and very unlike Addie at the same time. 

The husband came barreling back into the house wielding an axe; she barely dodged the swing in time. He used the momentum from his run to bring metal upon metal; it bounced off with a ding, and Mr. Kolmer careened into the door and sank to the ground. 

His wife was crying openly now, and the sounds coming from the other side simply lacked description. They were not nice. 

The man brought himself into a kneel, and raised the axe far above his head. He brought it down upon the door with all his anger; it bounced violently back, cracked him on the forehead, and rendered him unconscious before he had hit the floor. 

Mrs. Kolmer crawled over to him and cradled his face. Fresh sounds brought her attention to her daughters door frame, and she crawled as far as she could before the door stopped her advance. She scratched vainly at the wood. Scratching returned from the other side, and Mrs. Kolmer furiously dug her nails in, hoping against hope that her daughter was trying to communicate with her. 

It took two full minutes before she realized that all of the scratches were exact imitations of her own; whatever was on the other side of the door was mocking her. 

Mrs. Kolmer clutched the doorknob and rested her face in her arms. She did not know how much longer Addie would be able to cry, but from the sound of it, it wouldnt be much time. 


Mr. Kolmer awoke first. Dappled sunlight shone on the rug, the hearth, his wife. She still lay slumped against the door, passed out from exhaustion.

The world waved under his feet as he unsteadily rose; blood caked the side of his face, and his balance was loopy at best. 

When he fell to the ground, his face stopped inched from his wifes eyes. They immediately bolted open, completely bloodshot. She was confused for only a moment, then scrambled in horror as she took in the sight of the bloodied man.

Addie, Addie! the man screamed, and forcibly pulled his wifes panicked figure from the doorway. 

This time the doorknob worked. He threw his weight into the wood and stumbled into the room. There he stopped. 

His daughter was dead. She lay on the bed, perfectly still. She might have been sleeping, but she was not moving at all, and her eye sockets were empty. Dry, cracked blood caked her face in twin paths between her eyes and her shoulders. 

Mrs. Kolmer sprinted past her frozen husband and scooped up the corpse that had been her daughter. She screamed.

Mr. Kolmer walked slowly, unsteadily toward the scene. His dead daughters face sat on her mothers shoulder, dead skin already beginning to droop as her head lolled to the side. 

He sat slowly on the bed and rested his hand on her neck. Mr. Kolmer pulled his hand back quickly; her skin was unnaturally cold, and he was not prepared for it. 

His wife slowly laid the body back on the bed and pulled away, her sobs now frozen still by shock. They sat and stared for a moment at the body. It would have been looking up at the ceiling if it still had eyes.

The corpse reached out its icy left hand and grabbed Mr. Kolmers wrist. He was too petrified to react at all.

Addies body rotated its head to her mother, fixing its empty sockets on her eyes. It spoke, with resolve, in her daughters voice.

Dori. Ori. Laso. Laso.

Then she was still.

It took several moments before Mr. Kolmer finally found the emotional strength to pry his dead daughters fingers from his wrist. Her muscles had already started to stiffen, and they did not come loose easily. 

He dropped the wrist limply to the bed. 

Mrs. Kolmer looked where it landed. It was only then that she noticed that the trail of blood continued across Addies blanket, down to the floor, across the room to the bureau. There, the caked blood rose up across the face of the drawers and to the feet of the standing figurine. 

It had brown eyes. 


The story circulated across an expanding nation. It is still recalled today, when people use the acronym of the chant to describe these housebound figurines.

<TEXT> Theyre in the house.

Two of them, at least, and probably more. Im sorry that this will be typed so fast, I have to get everything out as quickly as I can.

My husband was out when someone knocked on the door after 10:00 p.m. I knew something was wrong, so I backed out of the living room. I took Chloe (six-year-old daughter) with me very quietly. 

When the living room window shattered, I grabbed her and ran up the stairs. Were hiding under my bed. 

I left my phone on the kitchen counter. No time to grab it.
 
I was able to grab the laptop off the bed, but have no messenger program and no time to download one. I need to type up what is happening in case we disappear.

I have a very bad feeling about what these people want. I wont send an email because those can be deleted. Im going to send this to the biggest message board I can find; theres no way to call for help, but Ill be damned if I go away and no one knows why. At least Ill have that.
 
Madison (16-year-old daughter) was in her room when this happened. I have not heard a sound from there. I have my arm wrapped around Chloes head to keep her quiet. Call me a bad mom if you will, I wont have her dying because her cries were too loud. I told her to bite down on my arm if she feels she cant hold it in. 

This bedroom is on the second floor. Only one inside staircase. No roof under the window, just a straight sixteen-foot plummet. This is bad.

Shit shit shit

Keep it together, Lacy. Okay, half of the reason Im writing this is to stay sane, Im trembling in the dark and squeezed under my bed. Chloe is shaking to the point of nearly convulsing. 

I hear voices downstairs. Angry talking. I do not recognize them. They are mens voices.


No


A gunshot.  A loud one. Cooper (eight-year-old son) was in his bedroom. I did not have a chance to get to him before I ran upstairs. 

No, I chose not to. Its true. And if I die tonight Ill burn in hell. 

Now theyre shouting. 

Come on OUT, Lacy. We know youre up there.

An angry voice. 

And I realize that being under the bed is the FIRST place theyll look. Of course it is. The bed and the closet. The most obvious places.

When they come for me, they will find me.
 
I have to plan. God help me. What do I do? 

I have to get out of this hiding place. I have to get out of this house. I have to move now, before they come up here and its far too late. 

Think.

Were losing PATIENCE. Angier still.

Lacy, stop writing. Stop yourself and get out from under this bed. Move NOW.


Oh no.


Terrified screaming. Its Coopers voice. They have him.
