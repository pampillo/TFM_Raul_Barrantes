<TEXT> To be honest, it would not surprise me if many down votes are from bot accounts or one dude who has 100 fake accounts that just despises something heart felt. At first I had up votes, so some people did like it, some worthless neckbeard comment with no meaning other than animosity gets self voted up more than likely. Reddit is a cheesy place anyways, its typical for a true neckbeard as they say, to go around and trash on everyone else. Words like Cringe and Neckbeard lets you know automatically that the poster is probably a teenager or one of those internet junkies.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You might be right, out of 2k likes what I find funny is only  one person finds the need to tell me how I should title my post simply because they feel it will somehow help people discover a game. 
Furthermore, limiting their need to be social and just ask a question to invoke a conversation among people to discover the game instead.  
I guess what im saying is I see your point, yet after much digestion before replying, I see it as something I can easily pass by and continue to do it my way without having to feel as though im a standoffish jackass who only wants it my way. 
In my own perception, my way is equally if not more beneficial. Unintentionally.....but still easily rationalized into something good and completely normal.    </TEXT>

Mine has like 2k and only one person seems to have a particular hard on for title specifications. Im not saying I disagree with the context of what you are saying though. 
Im just used to being somewhat social and staying on top of my posts enough that truly I didn't even consider naming it. Plus I would not know which game to even put as the title, this fan art doesn't really imply which one, at least to my knowledge of those games.  </TEXT>

To be honest I posted it for people who know the game, im not trying to spread awareness about some old ass game, you're being difficult because you like things your way, and im just telling you im never going to do it even after you tell me. To be honest with you I never even bought or played the game myself more than a few hours...never played anything outside of Elder Scrolls.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think some people have experienced so much trauma and BS, that they process the emotion like anyone else, but the duration at which they do is shorter and maybe less dramatic than most. Possibly their release of chemicals for that emotion might be less because they have been so over burdened with emotional responses in the past. Like going numb, but still feeling the context of the emotion, being able to respond and such yet without much of the overdramatic facial expressions and child likeness of most people.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> See you may confuse bad people with decisions of the entire conservative objective. Being a Conservative to me is about doing what works and making those things better, many things are of a value basis for us, the Liberal agenda is about being open to things just for the sake of doing whatever people want, without realizing many peoples opinions are shit. Just because someone has an opinion does not make it worth a single cent. 
Like abortion and legalizing all things for the sake of giving people a decision, I should not have to tell people not to go pick up tar off the road and eat it,  as soon as you tell someone not to do it, now everyone wants to do it cause they saw a buddy do it. Naturally when a few kids die they make it illegal, then you have a mass of dumbasses with signs saying legalize road tar for recreation, compile a lot of pseudo data to support the agenda, completely oblivious to ACTUAL science.  

Thats kind of what I think when I hear Liberal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> VPN exit nodes in most countries still fall under local laws and collect all kind of user data. Its only good to get around blocks, but as far as safety, yeahhh right. If they have interest in someone, they will tag and track even VPN data, easily. Like if an exit node is in France, go read french internet laws. 

If the VPN company is American they could still totally be tracking and saving all data. If you cant trust things already set up, why do people think they can trust third party companies with privacy? Whats to say there are no set up systems designed to trick people with security? All the while thats how people have been getting caught.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The point of dressing provocative to attain sexual attention is of one spectrum, as to loving the aesthetic nature of an outfit or whatever to the other spectrum, of many. I think we should all feel empowered and comfortable to be fully nude, thats true freedom. People will dislike a modest outfit, a provocative outfit, a fully nude image, so really it comes down to this. 
What really finalizes the score, is the intention behind the photo, the thought process and the goal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right there with you, about the same amount of time Ive been sober. Never taken meth, but I smoked pot, taken some shrooms and 25i for a while, drank, even smoked that legal shit. I know exactly what the paranoia feeling is like and having psychosis. I had a thing and still do to a degree where I see pictures and have these delusions they are communicating specifically to me in a strange way. Eating raw vegetables not only helps a lot of health problems but its also cheaper, that, plus some motivation from Jesus Christ helped me. Getting in a good mind frame and just refusing to go out without giving this life we have been given some kind of real effort. 
I know people can have their opinions on Pot and all, but even that caused me problems, I had been a long time smoker on and off, even when I didn't do other stuff it was always a battle and a lifestyle that led to negative behavior. 

If you want to get better and be better, you MUST stay away from intoxication of any kind. Maybe get a gym membership, read the daily bible verses the bible app posts everyday, pray....and just show up and work somewhere. Gotta keep the mind busy. 
It is also really important you look into Christ and believe that he died selflessly for man, as an example of our sin, as an example to men. 
All other philosophies give insight, but the biblical one gives REAL results.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thats a rich persons way of saying don't tax our end, lets tax it on the end closer to the consumer. We work, our checks get taxes taken out, we buy a product, taxes get taken out, we drive on the road we have to buy a tag, we use a cellphone and have to pay FCC charges. Hell you cant even buy something used and not have to pay tax again on that same item thats been bought and taxed already.

So in my search to see what the big deal was, there was a pic that shows what appears to be Emma taking a bath, taking a selfie that shows her nipples. Her face is cut off above the mouth and she is sticking her tongue  out. Looks a lot like her, if it is her, to answer your question, her nipples are of perfect proportion.  </TEXT>

Cuck: Yes sir, Captain.

<TEXT> So, you ban a phrase in favor of one group, yet encroach on another group that identifies with those phrases, because the other group cant get past the part where it is not always about them.....riiiighhhtttttt. Its not even like those things are derogatory or anything. (To my knowledge) 
If I hear of a ladies only type of function or something only women do together to bond, I don't get offended, I simply realize what it is, like ladies night at public functions. 
Maybe change the context of how the words are used and explain how these terms were used in a mostly male run society at one point and then explain to the lame brains that you can simply replace the gender word to fit anyone into the same situation.   </TEXT>
