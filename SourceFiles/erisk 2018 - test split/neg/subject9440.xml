<TEXT> I loved Peter dancing by himself in the original because the audience didn't know it was a comedy.  Everyone was so reserved and unsure it was such an interesting theatre experience.  That said still think dancing Groot was better.  It was more technically efficient and Peter never fought an adorable tiny Trex. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If Marvel was running the character this would happen.  But Disney / Marvel has this track record that allows them to drop hundreds of millions on films because they know it will work.  FOX doesn't have that luxury.  For every Logan, theres a Fan4Suck. That company looks at money above everything else and right now it doesn't make sense to spend 200 Million on a character when the same money will get them a sequel and second franchise starring Deadpool that should easily hit a Billion each. 
  
Hell, perfect example. Due to the Sony / Marvel deal they each have to pay for their own films.  So Sony had to write a check to film Homecoming.  Because they needed Robert Downy Jr in the film Sony turned down Marvel's pick for Vulture because they didn't want to pay for Michael Keaton as well.  Its rumored that Marvel paid for Keaton out of their own pocket because he was the right person for the part.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Heres the problem with this film.  They were preparing to give Gambit 150 - 200 Million dollar budget and groom it too be their next Wolverine type character.  Thats why they got Channing Tatum to play him.  Thats why they allowed Tatum to get more money by playing hardball during negotiations.  Then Deadpool happened.  All of a sudden they have their next Wolverine, and the support of millions of people.  And even more fun, it made Avengers money on the first try with practically no money or management.  Then even better, the star and creative driving force of the film WANTS to do more movies and a new franchise and doesn't want big budgets or management.  FOX doesn't want to pay Tatum his ridiculous fee or spend 200 Million on a character they don't need because Ryan Reynolds is giving them everything they want with literally no effort on their end.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know how kids are these days.  They don't understand loss and striving to get better.  They just quit.  Two weekends ago he woke me up at 7am on Saturday to play Halo Warzone.  15 seconds into the match he grenaded a group of grunts and hit #1.  Gave me a bunch of shit over the headset.   By the end of the game he was dead last and I was #2.  So he said I was #2 because I used a tank.  So round two I didn't use a vehicle and came in #3 he was still dead last.  He didn't talk to me for the rest of the weekend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before this film, I was worried.  People said it wasn't as good on twitter.  Professional reviewers said it wasn't as good as the original.  I read someone say it was bottom three of the entire MCU.  Now that I have seen it, I have no idea what those people were talking about.  This was great.  It didn't have a lot of action, but I think that was more so on purpose.  Hell, this film starts with the standard blockbuster opening set piece but James Gunn decided to not focus on the action.  Instead we focused on Baby Groot dancing around to a song while it happens in the background.  I think it was great.  It was like the movie started with a disclaimer "this isn't your typical movie".  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is why Cisco was such an important character on The Flash.  It gave them a believable way to funnel all that 60's golden age non-sense into the world.

I went home with the bag and the sandwich was right, and tasted pretty good.  Still creeped out that they had it ready before I came in the building. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's playable but you need to do a few things.  First you must buy the complete version with all the DLC.  Then when you start the game, only use the batmobile when you have too.  Never just drive it around.  Next you need to avoid the riddler entirely.  You physically have to do one thing but after that, just ignore that dumbass.  And finally, once you feel the Batmobile wearing you down, play one of the added DLC Side Quests.  Save them until that fucking car pisses you off.  If you follow these steps the game will be great. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reminds me of the fourth grade.  I left my history textbook at home and my buddy, who sat in front of me, said I could share his.  So we were minding our own business and the teacher decided to draw attention to the fact that I didn't have my book.  He exclaimed like a douchebag that I couldn't follow along reading his book upside down.  I said "I can read upside down, its not hard" and the teacher laughed and forced me to read the next page outloud in front of the class.  I did it upside down and the class sort of exploded in laughter at his red embarrassed face.  At this point he said I was "disrupting class" and made me go to the principal's office.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thats why Battlefield is so different than the other shooters.  Sometimes the enemy team will work together and its almost impossible to fight.  Other times your team is together and you plow through the opposition.  Its so uneven.  The only time Battlefield is good is when both sides are actually playing the objective.  I wish there was a way for DiCE to make it clear for the COD fuckheads that keep ruining Battlefield games. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem people don't seem to understand here is money.  If you haven't realised this season has been vastly expensive.  Every episode has new locations, actual VFX and an actual team of stunt people for Oliver to thump.  I'm not kidding about the new locations, stop and think about it.  Most episodes have two new locations.  On top of this, the producers hold back money for the final three episodes.  They have done this since the first season.  So we have a show that costs more than normal, and they are holding money back.  Of course the episode before the final three would be made on the cheap.  Think about it.  The entire episode took place in an established location and mostly only featured two characters.  It was made on the cheap specifically because they needed the money.  Doing an Andrian episode would be great BUT it would be ridiculously expensive.  The people in charge had to make a decision, using the money for the finale is just a no brainer.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to paraphrase what happened.  Microsoft paid for the script.  Then they signed with CAA over the film rights.  Every studio said yes, FOX just wrote the word "Yes" on their bid sheet.  It was a huge deal.  After every studio was foaming at the mouth over the property and Microsoft promptly lost its damn mind.  They sent out a list of demands for the rights.  
  
They keep all merchandising.  
They don't pay for any of the film.  
They get paid back in full for the script.  
They get 30% of the profits.  
They get a bonus if it underperforms at the box office.  
They wanted first class airfare for over sixty Microsoft employees for the premiere.  
They want full creative control over the film and required the film to be shipped to Seattle every night.  
They also needed one of their executives to be on set at all times.  
  
The cost of their demands was just too damn high.  At one point Universal and Warner were trying to split the costs to start production but it just never worked.  Microsoft's demands combined with Peter Jackson and the directors costs would literally mean the studio wouldn't make any money off the movie.

<TEXT> Arrow is great.  Olicity is dead.  There has been one short scene about their relationship and the majority of the time they both act like they never dated. They have money again, every episode has at least one new location.  New trick arrows.  At one point Oliver shot goddamn fire out of his bow. The villain is legitimately great and his "End Game" has literally nothing to do with saving a city or an army of baddies.  The story is literally building to the finale.  It's like they actually thought up the entire arch before they wrote it.  Oliver is killing again.  DOLPH LUNDGREN! Multiple huge returning characters.

<TEXT> I'm going to be downvoted for saying this, but this show isn't really about telling a story.  It's about reminding people that its in the Breaking Bad universe. Every episode has multiple nods to the show, some are hidden or less obvious and others have huge neon signs over their heads.  Literally nothing happens on this show.  In three years, Jimmy still isn't Saul.  He switched offices and got a fancy desk.  Thats pretty much it.  My sister has more drama in a week than this show has given us in three years.  But we tune in every week because we miss the adventures of Walter White. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read the book last month for this show.  The show is moving faster than it should and is adding a lot more violence and weirdness than it should at the start.  In the book, Techincal boy just picks him up in a limo.  His children are unrecognizable not thumb faces on bodies.  They don't try to kill Shadow, they just gave him a message for Wednesday.   It was also wierd that they kept the dialog after they changed the scene.   The world of the gods doesn't really become *true* until Shadow goes on the carousel and I kinda liked it that way.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Legion was set in the X universe, but for some reason that link was removed before the pilot aired.  (Most likely because Stewart and McAvoy aren't contractually obligated to appear on TV.) Now FX is doing a second show that is hardcore set in the universe.  It's being ran by Matt Nix (Burn Notice / The Good Guys) and stars Stephen Moyer (True Blood) and Amy Acker (Angel, Dollhouse, PoI). The second show is titled "Gifted" its unclear if thats the production code or the title of the show.  </TEXT>

So, being a good uncle, I got up and we started a game of Warzone.  10 seconds into the game he starts giving me shit because he was winning.  By round two I was two spots ahead of him.  By the end of the game I was #2 and he was dead last. I taunted him the entire game.  He claimed I was #2 because I got a wraith.  So the next game I didn't use a vehicle and hit #3 and he was still dead last. He didn't talk to me the rest of the weekend.  Played Halo by himself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just another useful tip.   
  
Call your cable company and ask for the new services sales rep, then ask that person for current deals.  You physically have to ask for the deals, they will not tell you on their own.  Nine times out of ten the show you want to watch has a current deal.  I never pay full price for cable channels.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jesse and Hank were both slated to die at the end of Season 1.  Writers strike killed those plans.  For Season 2, Walt was supposed to give Jane an OD but AMC decided that it was too early for Walt to go full evil and they changed it to an accidental death.  Also every season after 2, the writers got together to try to make Walt unlikable and every year they failed.  They couldn't believe after Brock that people were still rooting for him. </TEXT>

Barry traveled to another universe, the past and future BY HIMSELF but needed Wally to help him get to the future?  
  
Why couldn't Cisco still vibe out of his feet?  
  
Why is Barry still keeping damn secrets?  Didn't tell Wally or Cisco what happened to them.  If anything Cisco needed to know immediately to make heated vibe gloves.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dark Knight Rises in IMAX.  About thirty minutes in the
film the projector shuts off.  It got so dark in that room.  Then the cellphones and yelling started.  Ten minutes later someone came in with a flashlight and said they would get the movie back on in a minute.  Almost twenty minutes later the movie starts up and it's an hour further into the movie.  Then more screaming.  The movie stops the flashlight lady comes back and says they're working on it.  About five minutes into the new wait this old man gets up and loudly excliams "Fuck this horse shit!".  This fat woman turns around and gets mad because he cursed in front of her child.  The old man screams "I DIDNT KILL FUCKING JAP PRICKS SO I COULD WATCH MY LANGUAGE!" and walks out the of the theatre.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Felicity is back to being a supporting character.  Oliver is back to be CW Batman.  The action is really improved.  Hes using new trick arrows.  At one point he shot fucking fire out of his bow which was awesome as shit.  DOLPH LUNDGREN! The villain is damn close to nearing Slade Wilson levels of awesome sauce.  This entire season has been building to a finale that keeps looking better and better. 
And even though I fucking hate Curtis with every fiber of my being, the other sidekicks all turned out pretty great.  
  
And the best part of all, Olicity is fucking dead.  There's been one short scene dealing with that non-sense this entire season and even that was handled with care.  The majority of this season neither one really acts like they ever dated.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I learned about voltages when I was a kid.  I had a magnetic chess set that talked and moved the pieces.  It was awesome.  One day the cord  went bad and it wouldn't work anymore.  My dad told me to just plug another cable in.  So I went and got my NES power cord and plugged it in my chess set.  It said "Hello, would YOU LIKE TO PLAY A GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!" then it started smoking.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> FYI : FOX had no faith in Deadpool. They also were freaking out over Logan once they realised they couldn't take the R rating from them again.  Mangold filmed the movie as practically as possible specifically because FOX took the R rating from them on The Wolverine.  Hugh Jackman also had to pay for some of the movie himself.  
  
It needs to be made clear, FOX had NOTHING to do with the success of either of these films.  Deadpool was great because of Ryan Reynolds.  And Logan was great because James Mangold knew FOX would try and pull the same shit they did a few years ago.  Giving FOX credit for either of these films is like giving your dog a treat for shitting on your bed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It happened.  The Rock and Vin Diesel were never on the screen at the same time.  Not once.  
  
The scene at the end after the retarded fireball save, EVERYONE gets out of their car but The Rock.  
  
The crash at the beginning, they used a stand in for Vin Diesel you only see the back of his head.  There wasn't even a closeup of Vin in that scene, which is fuckng odd considering it was a big moment and hes the star of the film.  
  
The BBQ at the end there's another shot of Vin from behind that honestly looked added in with CGI. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Years ago I was learning to drive and my dad was very stubborn about a hamburger joint by our house. They always screwed up the order after 9pm, and he always wanted to go there after 9pm.  So I drove to Braum's and we said very clearly that we wanted two burgers and fries with no mayo.  We made them repeat it.  We pay and I start driving to the road when my dad screams "MOTHER FUCKING MAYONNAISE!" and jumps out of the moving car.  I just had a learner's permit so seeing my dad leap out of a moving car was startling.  He starts storming off inside the restaurant and I go and park.  As I park I see him throw the bag of food at the wall and start throwing his arms up and down like a crazy person.  When I went in the place it was dead silent, all the employees were off in a corner hiding and the manager was making new food. It honestly felt like he was robbing the place.  Never seen such a stunned silence before.  It was so quiet you could hear the grill. We kept going there after 9pm and after this day they never screwed the order up again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know its technically not a movie, but the Black Mirror series on Netflix is three seasons worth of stand alone episodes.  They are all basically hour long films. There's a few that are scary, others that will l freak you out or make you feel uneasy.  There's one called "White Christmas" that haunted me.  I couldn't sleep the night I saw it, kept thinking about the ramifications of that world.  I wouldn't recommend watching that one first, its highly regarded as the best of the series.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reminds me of my trip to the zoo a few years ago.   They had this enclosed exhibit with Lemurs.  You go in and they run up for food.  They jump on your back, climb in your lap, let you pet them.... etc.  Its a lot of fun.  When I went a Lemur jumped in my lap and went to sleep.  Then shortly after another Lemur jumped on my shoulder looking for food and the napping Lemur turned around and bitch slapped the Lemur on my shoulder.  He then promptly went back to his nap.  It was awesome.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your headphones are haunted.  This is what you do.  
  
Step 1 : Dig a hole in the backyard of your house.  It needs to be exactly 5 feet from the home.  
Step 2 : Cover the hole in salt.  It needs to be white.  
Step 3 : While playing "Black Sabbath : War Pigs" on the loudest speaks available too you.  Put the headphones in the hole.  
Step 4 : Before the song is over, cover the hole with dirt and piss on it.  
  
After five days the headphones should be fine.  Just pull them out of the ground and enjoy. Oh and if the headphones are from Turtle Beach you need to play "Britney Spears : Work Bitch" instead of War Pigs.   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Legends of Tomorrow's first season wasn't great.  They shackled the story to two similar uninteresting baristas and a villain that made no sense.  Most people watched a few episodes and just gave up.   
  
The second season, is one of the most fun TV shows I have ever seen.  They got rid of the dumb hawks, fixed their villain problem and added several new characters that add to the show instead of dragging it down.  Its not only better than Season 1, its better than most of the stuff on the CW.  You really should give it a chance tomorrow.

<TEXT> There are multiple pictures and tweets.  Its real.  The TV mode overclocks the processor and it heats like your cellphone when you use it too long.  The dock doesn't have proper ventilation and traps the heat next to the device.  Over time this is causing problems.  People are playing Zelda for hours on end in dock mode and the heat is damaging the device.  Warping is just the noticeable issue.  That kind of heat could severely damage the internal components.  The more people use a Switch, the more this problem will show up.   </TEXT>

I woke up after a late night of drinking.  Blinds were drawn and I was still achy from helping my buddy move the night before.  Rolled over and grabbed the remote for my TV and started flipping.  I was desperate to find something because I didn't want to get up.  I see Kiefer Sutherland with a gun and think this will work.  Then he says, "We're going to have a big enough firefight that they can see us on the thermal satellite." and I was like "What the fuck is this?" then he starts killing everyone.  Guns, Knifes and general extreme bad assness. It was a marathon of Season 4 and I layed in bed watching it until the finale.  The next day I went to best buy and bought Season 1 and 2 on DVD.  Funnily enough, if it wasn't for the marathon I wouldn't have liked Season 1 and watched any more of it.  Jack doesn't really kill anyone in that season.  He spends most of the time running away.  Jack really isn't Jack until Season 2, which is easily my favorite season. </TEXT>

[Japan](http://movieweb.com/marvel-spider-man-movie-song-deal/)  
  
I can't find anything specifically mentioning the other deals but they tried very hard to get him in Avengers 1.  The cameo would have been when Stark falls.  The other mention was Oscorp in the skyline.  Sony outright denied the cameo appearance, they approved Oscorp after ILM locked the skyline FX and at that point it was too late to change it.

<TEXT> This is all bullshit.  
  
a) The Sony/Spider-Man movies stopped because Sony *JAPAN* demanded that they stop dishonoring the character.  They were the ones that proposed the deal.  Sony Pictures would have never done this deal and have denied Marvel negotiations for years.
  
b) The Spider-Man deal was so convoluted and drug out that we almost didn't get Spider-Man in Civil War.  If they didn't push the airport fight all the way in the back of the shoot and actively plan for the character that wasn't guaranteed it wouldn't have happened.  Several producers and people on the crew thought it wouldn't happen in time.
  
c) This is the woman that said, "We will *NEVER* give Spider-Man back to Marvel."  
  
Edit :  
 
d) Michael Keaton almost didn't happen because Sony didn't want to pay for him.  Its rumored that Marvel had to pay for him outside of the deal. </TEXT>

The developers don't have to make the game run on all three consoles, all they have to do is one and the consoles will automatically scale down or up.  Every single game out right now will *AUTOMATICALLY* work on Scorpio, and just like the BC games they will run better than they do on The One.  This is out of the box functionality.  On top of this, the publishers will be giving out updates that make the games work even better.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> From what I understand, the asian countries didn't have a big movie theatre demand.  It just wasn't as prominent as it is in the US.  But that has changed and now more movie theatres are opening up over there.  So Hollywood has essentially been exploiting this new naive audience to make easy money off of this unsuspecting group of people.  Also because of the laws in Japan and China they have to specifically fund those movies or they can't get a release.  So on top of exploiting this new audience they aren't even paying for most of the production.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem with Season 1 was that they didn't know what the show was when they started filming it.  They gave us two characters with identical abilities, and wrap them up in the main plot with the villain.  Which ended up bogging everything down because none of them were interesting.  BUT, Season 1 had moments of greatness.  There were several episodes that didn't deal with the hawk idiots or the main plot and they were just way better than they had any right to be.  I knew as a viewer that those episodes meant that they figured out what the show is, they just couldn't do much about it during the first season.  Then season 2 starts and [Boom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9X6R57WcUg).

<TEXT> For the next season they are hiring younger doppelgangers for the cast for flashbacks and using the full cast together for present day.  Obviously the switch between past and present is being used to bridge the gap on the various actor's schedules.  
  
Also, this won't work.  They can't find younger people that can hold a candle to Will Arnett, Jason Bateman, David Cross, Tony Hale or Jeffrey Tambor.  It's impossible.  Their comedy timing is what made the show popular.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its probally bending because of the mobile CPU and no proper ventilation. I would assume that the mobile processor is heating up more in dock mode (because dock mode overclocks) and the heat is being trapped by the plastic wall.  This is very similar to what happened to the X-Box 360.  The chips got so hot that they literally popped off the mobo.  If the switch is bending after a month then I would assume the handheld will be rendered useless in a few months.  
  
It's odd that Nintendo didn't see this coming.  It would have been pretty easy to install a fan to blow up through the slot and suck the air out of the base.  Kinda makes me wonder if the Switch was something else and this dock TV station thing was added in the last minute.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most TV shows have a magic reset button where everything is better by the end of the episode or season.  Its a common trope, sometimes its harder to spot but its usually there.  Anyway, I really like that they didn't reset Oliver by the end of the episode.  Going into the next episode he'll still be rattled from what happened.  It's very impressive and has me excited for the finale.   </TEXT>

They shoved the villain and those coffee making hawk people into the show and made everything about them.  It was just wrong.  Season 2, they fixed that problem.  The hawks will never come back.  The villains are actually interesting.  And they have added an entire roster of characters that add to the universe instead of weighing it down.  It's a shame that nobody is watching it because of Season 1. </TEXT>

The beginning of TDKR he did that for real and Warner got very mad because it would have been a lot cheaper doing it on a soundstage. I heard he spent weeks on Interstellar scouting locations for alien worlds.  He spent the majority of the production trying to figure out how to build that room at the end.  Dunkirk, he bought a 3 million dollar plane and crashed it into a mountain. In Dark Knight the tumbler bike was so complicated they had to train the stunt guy for two weeks to learn to drive it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Back when I was 5, I was sure our neighbour was getting in our trash cans.  So I told my dad and he told me to booby trap the can so we'd know if they were.  He said this because he figured 5 year old me was an idiot.  I went outside for an hour, and came up with a plan.  I duct taped a few party poppers to the top of the can and and then ran all those strings together and looped it around the bar so when they pulled the can open its party time.  The next day our neighbour, who was 70, opened our can and was so startled she had to goto the hospital. Also because I used too much duct tape the party poppers exploded into the garbage and set the can on fire.  I had to pay for a new trash can out of my allowance.  Our neighbour was fine, btw.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always stood by this game and said it was better than GTA IV.  Now im replaying GTA IV and im unsure which game is truly better.  On one hand, GTA V did most of the gameplay better than IV but IV had a better story and mini games.  It's really hard to pick.  Niko was a great character but so was Trevor.  
  
The only real advantage is V with its lack of tutorials.  I swear nothing is more annoying than playing 2/3rds of game and still getting tutorial missions.  </TEXT>

One of the greatest games ever made.  The gold standard amongst RPG's.  It has side missions more complex and amazing than some main storylines. It will keep you surprised throughout the story and it could take you 2 to 3 months to beat it at a fair clip.  If you take your time it could be next year before you finish.  No, im not kidding.  I know this sounds hyperbolic as fuck, but im actually underselling it. It is literally one of the best games ever made. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, no it wouldn't have been.  During the production of Avengers 1 Joss Whedon wanted to include Spider-Man because hes a fan of the character.  So they put in two optional Spidey cameo's into the script.  The first was when Tony Stark falls, Sony wouldn't allow them to use the character but they tried to bend over backwards to make it happen.  The second was Oscorp, which Sony actually said they could include in the film.  It wasn't in the movie because Sony drug their feet so long that the skyline FX was already completed by the time they got approval.  </TEXT>

It was just averaged at 1 million per minute. Blur did motion capture for every human in the cutscenes, which is expensive because you have to pay for actors, craft services, medical, stunt teams... etc.  They also had to essentially create new textures and models for everything because that wouldn't be available at the high level they would require. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, they do some great fights.  The problem is they let the directors have free reign over the direction of their episode.  Which means some of the episodes are weaker in that department.  Some people just can't direct action.  Also its a TV show which means they are always filming against the clock.
  
Edit : [Look at this John Wick Homage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gn9i1tvdBs4) they pulled off this year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you liked the show S1 - S3, then yes Season 5 is worth it.  It's worth it in spades.  Even more so if you have been following Stephen Amell on facebook.  Dude is straight up [SPOILERS](#s "hinting at a return of Deathstroke.  Manu has also been "talking" about the character.")
  
That said, Curtis is still annoying.  I actively hope hes killed when ever hes in danger.  Felicity is essentially a time remnant from Season 2 now. She never mentions their relationship or acts like her and Oliver dated at all.  It's just gone, like it didn't happen.  I think there was literally one short scene in 17 episodes that had anything to do with their relationship and even that was handled with more care than Season 4. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My opinion is based on a ten hour trail of which I played two hours.  I couldn't even finish the ten hour trial.  The last straw was when the dialog option I selected resulted in both characters talking to each other with no sound, then I spent 20 minutes trying to find Sam Node because the waypoint system is really hard to follow.  After I found Sam Node the game glitched so hard the game crashed.  Thats when I uninstalled the trial.  </TEXT>

This is why everyone who bought it doesn't want to say how bad it is.  They always spout the same bullshit you did "The gameplay is fun.  I like the jetpack.".  If you go through the various Mass Effect threads you will see that same line multiple times.  It's all bullshit.  The game is broken, and you deluded yourself into thinking otherwise.  Now you are forcing your delusion on unsuspecting victims.  </TEXT>

Even though everyone keeps pointing at the janky ass animations and glitches, the writing is also weak as hell which should be the biggest issue here.  During the trial, a Krogan shrugged away the Genophage like it wasn't a big deal and happily works for a racist Salarian whose behavior made his entire clan leave.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> So many neat things that I forgot about since GTA 5 was released.
  
I love how the Auto Target allows you to specifically aim while you are still locked on.  Popping out from cover and shooting someone in the head is just so much fun.  
  
I love how realistic the car crashes are in this game.  You can drive full tilt into a road block and slam the car out of your way.  You can also push morons out of the road.  Its also great that the doofuses get out of the car when you crash like we're going to exchange insurance info.   
  
I love how the animations are much more realistic when you drive over people.  You can hit them and stop and watch them roll, then when they get up you can do it again.
  
I love how mean the vendors are at Burger Shot.  I got a burger last night and the guy said "Fuck you Fatty!" when he handed it to me.  I also love how I finished my burger and shot that fucker in the face for calling me fat.  
  
I also love how the cops will warn you that you're speeding with their siren and the pedestrians will react realistically to your manic behaviour.  
  
Its also great that the cops will actually try to arrest you over just killing you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you've seen Logan you would have noticed the Firefly posters during the [attached Deadpool 2 teaser.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4tFNfROlqk) But that's not what im talking about.  I rewatched the movie tonight and noticed that the main merc with the robot hand has the [Serenity logo](http://i.imgur.com/1nZyCIp.png) on his robot hand.  You only see it for a few seconds when hes working on it.  I tried to get a good picture but none of the streams are very good quality.  I can tell you the logo was added in post because they posted an [early picture](https://www.instagram.com/p/BM4Dyjcj0y7/) and its not there. Im also fairly sure I saw a bluesun T-Shirt. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tuesday, I logged into play Borderlands 2 (BC) with my nephew.  We both got in the game and were in a party chat.  When I hit resume he vanished from the list of players.  We were still connected to party chat but I couldn't get him to join the game again.  When I looked into it further he was removed from my friends list and showed as "Offline".  He apparently was on last night and sent me several messages and invites, didn't see anything.  It's been two days, we both have turned our consoles on and off a few times but he still shows as Offline.  Anyone know how to fix this?   </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Spoilers] Which show is the best overall this year? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-20 17:59:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was looking at the previews for the shows this morning and realised we get Gorilla City, Mr Myxlplyx, Camelot and The Return of Several Arrow Villains this week. Looking back at all the episodes so far this year, and its kind of mind blowing.  There have been way too many good episodes and far few bad ones this year.  So, which show do you think is the best overall *this year* and why?  
  
For me, I think its Legends of Tomorrow.  Sara Lance is leading the show now, which is awesome.  Nate is damn close to becoming the best character on the show and I'm loving the Heatwave / Vixen thing.  Plus the Legion of Doom is just plain damn awesome. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Anyone remember the old Mace rumore before the season started? [Spoilers] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-17 17:45:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Before the season started there was a rumor that the new Director was the original Human Torch.  
   
*The original Human Torch began his existence in 1939 in the laboratory of Professor Phineas T. Horton, one of the pioneers in the field of artificial intelligence and robotics. The culmination of Horton's research was an android who mimicked virtually all of the functions of a human being, including independent thought, but was composed entirely of synthetic materials.*  
  
*The one flaw in the android's design concerned the photoelectric solar cells called Horton Cells which covered every square inch of his body and served as his power source. The cells were too volatile and caused the epidermis of the android to burst into flame upon contact with air but without harming the android itself.*  
  
So here's my theory.  Coulson followed Captain America back in that time, so its possible he'd know about Mace from the same era.  What if the briefcase is another power source, something to bypass the problem with his solar cells?  I also want to point out, this "*secret*" is coming out the same time the show is focusing on robot life, it just seems like there might be a connection. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Generally, the stunt doubles are hidden well enough under the masks and wigs but last night they fought without masks.  If you watch the fight again, Bam Bam used spotlights to drown out the light on the actor's faces.  It's freaking brilliant, and combined with close ups of the actual actors its damn near seamless.

<DATE> 2016-11-23 03:35:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So in the comics, Zoom isn't a speedster.  
  
*Zoom does not actually move at super-speed as most other speedsters do by using theSpeed Force. Instead, he alters time relative to himself. He manipulates the speed at which time flows around him, allowing him to go faster or slower in relative time to everyone around him, making it appear that he is moving "fast"; even most of the Flashes look to him to be moving in slow motion.*  
  
That "Fight" was strange in many ways.  He beat Barry on top of water. The readings on Flash's suit didn't register movement.  Also the running effects with that blue portal tunnel thing.  
  
What if they gave Savitar Zoom's comic ability? </TEXT>

I particularly liked how the story made sense, there honestly wasn't a single moment where something convenient happened to move the plot forward.  You guys should check it out, its great. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was excited to play this last night.  I come home and the game is a massive letdown.  You have to drastically alter the control settings just to make it drivable.  It's riddled with bugs, I lost several races simply because my car came to a sudden stop mid-drift without coming into contact with anything.  One race an SUV started spinning vertically through the road.  It also constantly bombards you with "BUY THE DLC!" ads.  I saw at least four in my two hours of play time, one of which pretended to be a new game mode. The cop lady told me about it, the mini map comes up to show it in Vegas and I hover over and it says, "PRESS A TO BUY THE DLC!"  Thats when I turned the game off.   </TEXT>

Considering they did several beta tests and each one had noticeable performance improvements there is most likely nothing wrong.  But withholding the code could mean that there is a problem and they are banking on people buying the game before word gets out.   </TEXT>

Last night, Wells talked in a normal voice which was almost a first for the entire season.  He also knew that Barry was exposed to chemicals, something that nobody would know.  As far as Team Flash is concerned he's a Meta just like everyone else.  So what gives?  Was this nothing more than a flashpoint reference or is Wellsobard back and pretending to be Harry again?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Damn this game is atmospheric.  The creepy ass whispering in the background.  The way the monsters come out of the ceiling and walls.  The way every single door actually makes you stop and prepare for whats on the other side.  The way you keep running low or out of ammo.  This game is essentially a playable horror movie.  I fucking love it and can't wait to beat it.  Its just so great that we get these gems for free. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Barry went back in time last year, didn't see a time wraith.  He went back this year and did see a Time Wraith.  People think it might be a dead speedster based on the fact hes wearing a [Flash Mask](http://i.imgur.com/EYYJgUV.jpg).  Could it be Eobard Thawne?  Maybe thats why Barry didn't encounter one last year, because none of the speedster's have died / phased out of existence yet.  This also might be why Eobard was able to drastically alter the timeline without interference.  </TEXT>

I tried about six different freeware file recovery programs today and they wouldn't even detect the files as images.  Does anyone have any ideas?

<TEXT> I was just wondering if anyone else is playing Stick of Truth through the Backwards Compatibility?  I've been noticing some sound issues towards middle / end of the game.  Sometimes a cutscreen will start with delayed dialog and sort itself out.  Other times the cutscreen will be devoid of dialog and will just feature the music. Im also playing Mirrors Edge and just beat Shadow Complex, didn't notice a similar issue on either of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I built my buddy a PC about five years ago.  Hes wanting to upgrade his video card and I've been doing some looking.  His price range is around $150 and I came across this GPU.  It seemed like a great deal, but on nVidia's site they show these [performance stats](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-960/performance).  His old system could handle Tomb Raider at 60fps / 1080p and he was using a GTS 450.  Why on earth does a card thats five generations higher seem to be worse?

<TITLE> [No Spoilers] James Bamford Directed Tonight's Episode </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-18 21:52:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> From Stephen Amell : *"But I will say that I do very much think that episode 407 is our strongest episode to date this year. James Bamford directed it, and he was one of the first guys that I met in Vancouver when I arrived for the pilot. On our second day of filming, I actually snapped his neck on the show, which was one of the first clips that was released. He's a wonderful guy, and after 70-plus episodes choreographing the fights and coordinating the stunts, he got an opportunity to direct. All of the things that he has wanted to see on the show, from an action perspective, he puts into this episode."*

They can't be unchecked.  I believe the third one is the "Share" settings for windows 10.  My boss needs it to default to Outlook instead of Mail.  I made Outlook the default for everything but Mail is still taking these settings.  I can't seem to find on a google a way to change the setting in the registry.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just played and beat Ground Zeroes on my X-Box One.  I loved it.  I thought the silencer degenerating was a really neat idea.  Anyway, I never played a real Metal Gear game before, but I decided to find some trailers for the new one to see what it looks like.  I was shocked to find flying dudes with flaming hands and zombies.  What the hell is going on?  The Ground Zeroes thing seemed very grounded in reality.  What exactly am I in for if I buy the full game?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never really played a Metal Gear game before, but hot damn was this impressive.  It might be the best looking game on consoles.  I'm saying that having played Ryse, GTA V and Witcher 3. But with all the pretty this game has to offer, I was most impressed by the difficulty.  It doesn't hold your hand. I have to say you all owe it too yourselves to download this.  Its free this month with gold. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What the hell happened to Hulu?  I couldn't watch the show without linking my CABLE SUBSCRIPTION to the account.  I couldn't stream it on my X-Box.  I couldn't transmit the show from my surface tablet to my X-Box.  It forced me to watch it on my computer.  Why do people even pay for this subscription service anymore if you need to also pay for cable and you can't even play the crap on your entertainment center?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So what if Oliver was killed by Ra's but he was impressed enough with his performance that he decided, after the fight, to save him? He used Maseo because it would be easy to exploit the relationship he has with Oliver and sell the con. What if everything that has happened after the fight was devised to get Oliver to accept The Offer? Hell Maseo even said it himself, the decision has already been made.

So I paused the installation on KI and allowed Ori to do its thing. I got ready for work during the installation and came back to my One to find Ori done and KI still paused. Why exactly doesn't the One start the install back up once the other is done? It was literally sitting there doing nothing. Is there a setting im missing? </TEXT>

**EDIT** Turns out my x-box e-mail and origin e-mail need to be the same so the system will notice it.  I couldn't change it myself because origin blocks hotmail domain.  So I contacted them again and told them to stop asking me dumb questions and do what im telling them too do.  Damn those people are worthless.  Anyway it works now. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is this CGI, Pre-Rendered or in game? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Generally, im very good at differentiating from CGI, In Game and Pre-Rendered cutscreens.  But yesterday they released this [footage for Battlefield Hardline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk34yU1BGiU) that has me stumped.  The opening video clearly looks pre-rendedered with in game assets.  But the same level of fidelity is clearly shown through out the video.  
  
Is the beginning of this video actually in-game?  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-02-03 21:16:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I went to Gamestop yesterday afternoon and was awestruck by a playable x-box one sitting in the corner.  It was the first time I have touched the controller or have seen the console in action.  The demo was for Forza, which I was under the impression ran at 1080p and 60fps.  The demo felt extremely slow to me.  The car would physically slow down, as if I didn't have total control.  The loading screen was riddled with "Buy this console" non-sense and it took two minutes before the game would start.  The entire experience really bummed me out.  
  
Does the actual game take forever to load?  
  
Do the cars feel like they are always going 20mph?  
  
Does the game take away your ability to drive the car the way you want?  
  
Is the feedback in the triggers adjustable? I could hardly feel it.   </TEXT>

Anyways, I had a four star rating and I was cruising in my favorite car.  A cop comes out along side of me and did that Pit Maneuver and generally that ends with me crashing my car.  Last night I managed to adjust the steering and re-gain control without hitting anything.  It was fabulous.  I wish I could of had a recording of it.  I know this won't be impressive to most of you, but I was really happy about it, and felt I needed to share. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I picked this up for $10 dollars at a used game store.  Its really bad.  I was wondering if anyone has beaten it and can tell me if I should even bother?  
  
I really don't like the game's layout, you have all these levels that are just 'pass this many people' or 'race to the checkpoints' there isn't any variety and the game constantly resets you if your more than a few feet away from the designated track.  Im also not in love with the weird hybrid storytelling where half the game is told with in game audio or cutscreens and the other half is text during load screens. </TEXT>

<TITLE> References in Saints Row 4 Spoilers </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-26 17:31:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What are some of the movies and game references you noticed in the game?

* The beginning was from the movie Predator, with the sunset and the helicopter.  
* Zinyak's death scene was from Chronicles of Riddick.  
* They took alot of inspiration from Matrix, They Live, Mass Effect, Crackdown and Prototype.  
* The Metal Gear Soild level  
* The Streets of Rage / Double Dragon level  
* "My god, it's full of stars" is from 2001, when you first meet CID. 
* Mat Miller's rescue has some Tron, Atari and Zork  
* The intro, with the president sitting on the throne with the saints staff reminds me of the ending from the first Conan movie  
* During the final mission when you get the power armor, the music and the subsequent dialogue with Zinyak (Why throw away your life so recklessly / That's a question you should ask yourself) is a reference to the 1986 Transformers the Movie.  
* Asha's missions are play on titles from the James Bond series. Three Count Royale/ Casino Royale, Kill and Let Die/ Live and Let Die, Saintfinger/ Goldfinger  
* Matt Miller's rescue mission was titled Zero Cool, which was the main hacker's handle in the movie Hackers.  
* The Murderbots are the T-800 from the Terminator franchise.  
* Various clothes and weapons from Firefly, Star Wars, Star Trek, Blade Runner,   Always Sunny in Philadelphia.   
* Keith David and Roddy Piper recreating the ally fight from They Live.  
* The chicken taunt is from Arrested Development  
* A blowup doll piloting the ship/in the pilot seat, which is a reference to Otto from Airplane.  
* The cargo hold in the ship is almost identical to the back of Serenity (Firefly)  
* The scene where you're escaping in your ship before Earth is destroyed is Star Fox 64 (Do a barrel roll!)  
* "Leave it to The Saints" is Leave it to Beaver, a TV series from the late 50s / early 60s  
* Shooting the cannon on the lawn at the White Crib, turns into Space Invaders.  
* Kinzie's super appearance is Raven from Teen Titans  
* Pierce's super appearance is Kung Lao from Mortal Kombat  
* Ben King's super appearance is Morpheus from the Matrix  
* Keith David's super appearance is Lando Calrissian from Star Wars. It really fits the traitor-turned hero thing he's got going on.  
* When Zinyac blows up the earth, you can hear a million voices crying out in terror...then are suddenly silenced.  
* The entire White Crib level is very simular to the West Wing.
