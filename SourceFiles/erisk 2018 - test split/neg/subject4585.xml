<TITLE> Blue Boar Inn </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 17:40:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I feel like this story won't get yall as scared as most of these stories but this scenario scared me shitless. 
    So about 3 years ago my gigantic family, 22 people, rented an old hunting lodge/bed n breakfast for a week. It was called the blue boar inn and has had multiple renovations dating back to being an old trading post when America was being explored. I could be incorrect about that part but it's extremely old. 

About halfway through the week I go into my moms room to get some ibuprofen because i had a headache. I promise I'm not retarded but I was having issue with the child lock because I was being impatient. So when I rip the pill bottle open I'm looking forward toward the bathroom mirror. Behind me I see a blonde boy wearing a plain red tshirt. Scared the hell out of me but I quickly turn around thinking it's my little brother who's blonde. No ones behind me. I think maybe he ran off so after getting the pills I go into the living room. My brother is wearing a green long sleeve and playing cards with my grandpa. Says he didn't come into the room. They're midway through the game so it's impossible for him to have had been tricking me. I'm scared but I don't tell anyone thinking id sound crazy. That night I lock my rooms door using the slide chain just as a precaution. My cousin and older brother ask me why and I jokingly say "so uncle David doesn't fuck with us." They're okay with it cuz no one wants to be woken up. Well that night someone is banging on our door and I mean it's loud. Wakes my cousin, brother and I up. We crack the door and no ones there. So we close it again and about 5 minutes later the banging continues. That happened randomly throughout the night and kept waking us up. I hadn't told them about the boy cuz my family does have a couple jokester and we say one of them was just messing with us. 

Two nights later the entire family is awoken to screaming. My younger cousin, 10, is yelling at the top of his lungs "GET AWAY FROM HER GET HIM AWAY FROM HER" pointing at the crib of his baby sister. Everyone goes to their room and checks what's wrong. No one his tbere. After calming the boy down we ask him what happened he tells us "he was messing with olivia" we ask who and he says "the boy with the red shirt" at this point I ask if the boy was blonde and he says yes. I'm about to tell everyone my story but my mom pulls me aside and says she knows what I saw because she thought she saw the same thing and that I shouldn't tell anyone because it might ruin the vacation. She tells me she doesn't think anything bad will happen and that he's probably not mean or anything so it won't matter. After that I stay up all night unable to sleep. I then hear my door knob jiggle and it try to open. The slide chain is locked of course so it only cracks and then the door slams. My cousin wakes up and we go investigate to no avail. After that I always believed in ghosts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of my friends exes came to his grandmothers funeral for the sole purpose of making it awkward for him to talk to family. She had told her friends what her plans were and they told him later. Basically every time he tried to talk to a family member she would run up and get in the conversation until he eventually told her to fuck off in front of his family. I'm sure he was super embarrassed. He and the girl had been broken up for almost a year. I hate when people call there exes crazy but she actually was crazy.  </TEXT>

Suddenly he gets a text and tries to swipe up on the message to get rid of it. He accidentally clicks on it and messages comes up. The entire class sees the teachers dick pic on his messages. Not only was there that but the entire class found out he was gay because the person who he sent it to was named matt.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Manipulation is the only category togashi hasn't been inventive with hatsu wise even though it has nice possibilities. They don't have to manipulate people, it could also be objects (gido) but what I want to see is them manipulating elements of nature. Not create things like transmutation but manipulate what's around them. I have an OC which can manipulate the polarity of objects and can cause things to attract of repulse each other which would be a very interesting nen ability. I think abilities like this are possible but haven't been explored in the manga enough.  </TEXT>

I'm a muscular, mediumly attractive guy who secretly is super into animation, and because America doesn't make enough adult animation in consequently into anime. Every girl I've had a romantic relationship hates if I talk about anime. I don't watch hentai or any of the big boob shit. I just love animation but the second anime leaves my mouth they don't ever want me talking about it. The stigma against it has always beat out my enjoyment of quality shows.  </TEXT>

It would have to be an extremely experienced nen user for this to work at all and would probably be one of the hardest abilities for the user to perform. I don't think it's needed either. All the other abilities are great and work cohesively  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's crazy that everyone keeps saying this because for me it was the opposite. I used to come home every day and watch TV until I fell asleep. I never went outside. I have almost fond memories of staring at nothing in my desk just imagining shit but was too introverted to go out and hang with people. My grades we're also shit. I started smoking and I was less stressed. It even affected me after it wore off. Like all the tension in my head was gone. I started hanging out with people just to hangout or smoke. I used to be a straight C student but my senior year when I started smoking my lowest grade was an 87, a B. It's helped a lot with the stress I felt and I was able to do stuff instead of being terrified of how to do it.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> This wasn't in my adult life but I was far too old to shit myself. I was about 14 on a school bus going to the beach. It was headed to a retreat hosted by my schools FCA, Fellowship of Christian Athletes. So we just got back on the bus from a Mcdonalds break. Everyone's laughing and having a good time. We're a mile or two down the highway when I hear a growl in the pit of my stomach. As someone with irritable bowel syndrome I know this sound well. I have to poop. I raise my hand and the teacher, who hated me because I once ate 14 donuts and threw up right beside her, walks down the aisle to sit beside me. I whisper "I have to use the restroom very badly. Can we stop". We're about an hour away from our destination at this point. She instantly tells me I have to hold it and that it was my fault for not going at Mcdonalds. She leaves and I'm stuck. Luckily no one was sitting beside me. I hold it for as long as possible until we hit a pot hole. The force propels me up and I unknowingly unclench my asshole. I shit extensively in that second and land on it. At 14 you would never let another teenager know you shit yourself. It's social suicide. So I sit there. As the smell fills the vehicle you can hear people screaming of an awful smell. Attempting to be coy I say we may have run over a skunk or broken sewage pipe. This seems to work as no one suspects poop to be the cause.  For the next 45 minutes I sit there in my feces. Every bump and turn only pushes a different body part into it. As time goes on the poop slowly makes it way down my jean leg. Luckily we reach the camp before I leave a calling card on the ground. I instantly go the that teacher and explain what happened. She rushes me to the bathroom and I change. It took ages and I missed an entire day of camp activity because of washing clothes and showering. Only a handful of people know this story because I told them later in highschool.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I posted someone similar to that but I had it be manipulator. You could manipulate the polarity of someone or something. With this you could make yourself have a positive charge and an enemy also have a positive charge forever keeping them away from you. It can also be used similar to bungee gum except no actual nen is attached. Give a multiples rocks positive charges and the enemy negative. When the enemy gets near all the rocks magnetically fly towards them. Very good for traps </TEXT>

<TEXT> Transmute the nen around your hands to be a muscle relaxing agent. So if you were to touch an organism whichever muscle you touch would go limp and be unable to move until it wears off. Perfect for a bounty hunter who doesn't wanna kill.  One way that would be a restriction is that the agent works on you as well so if you gathered it around your hand you wouldn't be able to grab and do things with that hand. Maybe throw a little emission in there if you wanna use it on someone and not yourself  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My DM, who knows at least more than me, explained a companion as a secondary character you can make during character creation that you control. This secondary character usually, but not always, is a part of the first characters backstory. The guy made his secondary character as basically a Lydia (skyrim reference) who carries things and does bitch work like reading maps but during character creation made him hella OP in fighting, along with his first character, and my issue is that I don't find it fun or fair that he has two extremely powerful fighters under his control. I posted this hoping to find a way to stop this without being a "dick who just doesn't like that my friend is having fun". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Me and my friends are fairly new at DND. We've all played at most 10 sessions. One friend, who's house we play at, looked up online how to make the best battle character. Which is cool and all since it helps against tough enemies but he made a companion who's equally as powerful but uses a bow instead of melee like the other. Both of these guys are able to one shot every enemy aside from bosses. Me and another character had a "practice fight" where you could be knocked out and revived but not die  against just one of his characters. We both died twice before giving up. How do we handle this huge power they have which usurps all fun during battle? The DM said he'd do something but I doubt he has a clue what to do or will do very little. What can he do? If the monsters get more powerful as needed to harm the two then no one else will be able to do anything and die quickly. How do we handle this because I doubt the DM will want to incur the rage of the house owner if he takes away one of his guys? Or am I just being a baby? </TEXT>

We all were in character, maybe the dark elf wasn't. His normal character was very similar to him. After hours upon hours of my friends character being a dick to the dark elf the owner of the dark elf put his head down and started crying. He just wasn't able to understand this was a roleplaying game and no matter what we told him he thought my friend just hated his guts. He has not been invited back to my knowledge. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm gonna sound like an ass but I've said this and youre exactly right. It's usually because I don't feel like I can be myself around a lot of women because a few bad eggs are assholes about me having a penis so I almost feel ashamed when talking to ones that I don't know if they are that way. For me atleast it just means I enjoy your presence and am not worried about scrutiny over small things anymore. It's weird how a few assholes can really cause you to subconsciously be stigmatized to a group.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing that makes kurapikas ability so strong is because if he is able to get red eyes during training in theory he could make a totally new nen ability that uses as many types as he wants but can only use it when he has red eyes. The ability to make an ability using all types in of itself is incredibly dangerous when people can train like netero and get that strong. Limitless possibilities  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why would togashi make ging use an ability very close to leorios after talking about leorios ability and it not be it? That would just be extremely bad writing. I think it's safe to assume that entire dialogue and action was to help give the reader an understanding on leorios ability. It's set up perfectly for that. Although technically you're right that there's no proof it can phase through. Except I'm pretty sure ging used warp punch and that was meant to give us proof he can warp through things. Him using it is the proof and the evidence that he used it is all context clues so I don't have scientific proof so we can just agree to disagree  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You don't have to punch? Ging said the ability was most likely for cutting tumors out using nen emission. What ging emits doesn't matter. The warping is the main part of the ability not the punch. With the context of him talking about the ability and then using something that warps an emmision to the other side mixed with leorios sonar it would be extremely bad writing if that Wasn't a version of warp punch. All context clues lead to it being a variation of warp punch. If you don't think it's warp punch then I think you have to be in denial because there would be no reason for it not to be.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well the thing is that it doesn't matter if the see leorio or not. As long as the person is at range then leorio can hit them before they hit him. Also someone would never use nen to guard their organs so that has no affect on the punch. Also ging did use warp punch but he warped an emission attack. Look at the manga panel again and you'll see he didn't break through the wall he warped the blast to the other side which would mean you can warp inside things such as the human body.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> What are some underestimated hatsu? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-03 17:05:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My answer to this is 100% warp punch which I see being in the top 5 strongest hatsus we've seen so far in the manga.  This ability uses sonar to detect people and then detect clots, tumors or anything in the body they need to get rid of. Then he just sends a small blast in that place to get rid of the issue. We know this is most likely what the hatsu was meant for from ging. However in fights this is equally strong since using sonar it doesn't matter how fast you are if you're touching the ground then leorio can hit you with emission nen inside your body where you can't defend using ren. This move is an instant kill against anyone who doesn't know it's flying weakness. </TEXT>

But that's with basic nen mastery not hatsu. Leorio is mediocre when it comes to shu,KO,zetsu and those types of things but his hatsu is godly. Think of it this way. Warp punch isn't meant to be a punch but rather to be used as a way to find tumors and blood clots(stated by ging) and then destroy them without cutting someone open. This means that leorio doesn't need to see to warp and he can warp anywhere in a body. Warp punch can be used to take out anyone from the inside and there is nothing they can do. I put leorio over gon because the difference in their hatsus </TEXT>

Naruto while being clumsy is still better at fighting. (Naruto trains martial arts and fighting while gon trains nen. Gon uses his nen to fight but still it's not martial arts training.)

Special ability- 
Naruto- Multiple weak clones which opens a lot of options and does residual damage
Gon-Jajanken which is a one shot but is extremely hard to land and predictable.
 
Speed- Gon wins but not by much. 

Weapons-Naruto has explosive kunai which can do huge damage possibly even a ko.

Winner- Naruto. 
Naruto's Arsenal of skill weapons and abilities gives him more options and opportunities to win. Gon is physically stronger and faster but it's not by a big enough margin to instantly win. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Paristons theorized hatsu fleshed out </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-20 20:46:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay so there's a lot of theories about paristons nen ability and my personal favorite is that he has the ability to turn on someone else's hatsu remotely. Here's my shitty hatsu that I came up with for this. 

Hatsu:StopLight

Description: By saying code words the user can trigger someone else's hatsu to do certain things

When the target hears the word "green light" their hatsu will go off. For example silvas giant nen balls would appear at his hands. This can be useful to either hurt himself or make him use up his aura until he's out. This ability can be used an endless amount of times but takes 30 seconds recharge. On time based abilities like killuas or conjured items the ability lasts 10 seconds. So if used on shizuku she can put her vaccuum away after 10 seconds.

When hearing "Yellow Light" the targets hatsu cannot come out or be used for one minute (if not already out) and if the hatsu is already in use or out it has to stay out for 30 seconds. In the second scenario gons jajanken would be stuck being powered up for 30 seconds and Killua would be unable to turn off his ability like he could when it's normally forced on.

<TEXT> Oh yeah the nen difference is humongous. But you need to realize how OP leorio's ability is. Warp punch is an ability that's used to send blasts of nen at tumors and bloodclots inside the body using sonar. Leorio is a doctor and in a fight only needs to send nen blasts, not even a real punch, at certain vital positions such as muscle tendons and even the heart if wanted. While razor is getting ready to spike the ball leorio can already be turning off his arms, legs and whatever else he wants.  Warp punch is quite an OP hatsu for detaining people  </TEXT>

<TEXT> People think I'm trolling by voting for leorio but leorio has on of the strongest hatsus we've seen and can easily take down any enemy by attacking their insides. Razor would win 100% if he gets close to leorio but he can't defend against the warp blasts on muscle tendons, pressure points and possibly the heart, but I doubt leorio would actually try to kill. Razor is overall the better fighter and nen user but I'm giving this to leorio because of the fact that he has options which give him a for sure win.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Leorio is strong. Leorio's ability warp punch is one of the strongest abilities we've seen thus far. Using sonar he's able to warp blasts of nen, probably not as strong as gings blasts though, into whatever part of someone's body he wants. Leorio probably doesn't have it in him to attack the heart and kill but if leorio can stay away from the Enemy he might as well Win always by just warp blasting certain muscle tendons and the like. He may not the same mastery of nen that gon has but if you look at how long he trained and how long gon trained there's only about a 2-3 month difference when you look at the month of no training gon had. Also leorio was definitely training because he had a fully formed hatsu by election arc, I doubt he could do that unless he was training hard. I would put leorio's mastery of nen at the same level as gon close to the end of greed island. Which isn't crazy good but it's enough to block some attacks and give him the chance to take out muscles using his OP ability. Leorio in my opinion has a better chance of winning a fight than gon.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We actually don't know if illumi is stronger than Killua still. Although we can agree illumi must have high aura due to the scene on top of the building and has a couple years more of experience he still has a fairly eh ability of its a 1v1 alone which is what I'm guessing we're talking about. I think illumi is stronger than Killua but at this point in time illumi hasn't actually shown us much at all in terms of real fighting. It wouldn't be right to just blindly believe Killua could not defeat him based solely on powers and tactical prowess. I think Killua is a character like law from one piece in that he has an ability with the possibility of defeating most people but due to him being a novice or having inhibitions the writer can make him lose any time without tarnishing him while also making him win easily if the plot allows it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This all of course my understanding of it so take it with a grain of salt. Basically hisoka has more aura due to his nen strengthening after death. You could say this because he feels he has enough aura to maintain two limbs worth of bungee gum at all times. If he had the same amount of aura as before there would be no reason for him not to let machi sow him up.  I think by giving him more aura it leaves him with much more options with bungee gum but doesn't make him Too powerful. Before he usually made bungee gum with his hands and feet and the most we ever saw him make was a small shield from butler coins. Now he could most likely create nets, large sheilds, armor etc. with his excess bungee gum.  </TEXT>

Also yes they weren't trying their very hardest ever but they weren't waiting for illumi either. It was a race to kill their target first. Actually I would bet they REALLY wanted to kill chrollo first because I'm guessing the dons paid more than chrollo. If illumi kills the Dons first then no pay.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Although I'll admit my reasoning May have been wrong the point still stands that gon normally could not kill pitou with a normal jajaken. Gons kick alone was stronger than a normal jajaken. The jajaken normally would never give pitou the exertion needed to fly even close to that high. If we are to assume that a blast of a lot of pure nen by Netero, although that may even be stretching it, is the same or slightly more damaging than jajaken then pitou would still in the end survive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Name:Magnet Mark

Type: Manipulation

Hatsu: Manipulates the magnetic polarization of something. All materials have a polarization but only metals have the right "frequency" to be affected by magnets normally. By touching an object, person or wall with my hand I can control the polarization of them which can give them magnetism.  Once I touch something the magnetism doesn't go into affect until activated. It's activated by either me saying "Negative" or "positive" to decide if it'll repel or attract other magnets. Or it has a preset polarization that is activated when another object with polarization touches it.Cannot control my own polarization. But let's say I touch my enemy and then touch a wall behind me. I can set their magnetic  polarization to be the same, pushing him away from the wall/me, or opposite where he is attracted to that area. In a close room scenario this can be very powerful by touching different parts of the room and the the opponent. Could entrap opponent by surround them with magnets all pushing against them making them similar to a paintball machine

Restrictions: I have to say out loud what each marked things polarization is. The pull or repel is stronger the closer I am to it. So if my enemy is stuck to a wall once I leave it'll be weak enough for them to get out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone saying gon has natural zetsu it still doesn't make sense. Kalluto,  an advanced nen user, used their best zetsu yet hisoka was instantly able to tell he was hiding. To me this seems just like something that wasn't thought all the way through by togashi which happens to all writers. Also I'm sure someone will say that because of his bloodlust he couldn't sense gon. Throughout the entire series when hisoka had blood lust he was keener and more focused on his environment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Leorio is the same level as them when they were creating their hatsu. He already has a hatsu. I think the fact that he had a pretty powerful ability makes up for gon and killuas talent for that time. He's not even close to gon and Killua during chimera arc but compared to greed island Killua and gon I think he's around that level. Leorio isn't a joke character in the manga like he is in the anime. Leorio isn't a weakling, he's just not as naturally talented as those two </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bungee gum because it's the ability I respect togashi most for making. Any writer can give one of the strongest villains an OP ability but bungee gum is random as hell and is only good because hisoka. Unlike most shounen villains who's abilities make them strong hisoka makes this ability strong. It's a testament to how great nen is.

Manipulation:It has so many possibilities aside from controlling people that haven't been explored yet.

Specialist because I feel like it's a sell out. When people make their OC nen abilities specialist I feel like it's just cheating because they are too lazy or unimaginative to listen to normal rules of HXH so they have to use specialist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Name:PhaseBlade
Conjugation/Transmutation
Ability: you conjure a sword which has the ability to transmute to any material thus is able to phase through that material. An example would be if I swung at you while you wore armor and it phased to steel then it would pass through the steel unharmed and the only hit you inside the steel. 
Second ability: By transmuting to phase material, example would be dirt, you can add the length or size of the blade by passing through said material. Although after a certain time that material changes back to dirt or whatever and the blade goes back to normal. 
Restrictions:In order to change material you have to yell the name of thay material and atleast 1 person has to hear you excluding yourself. 
For as long as you have the sword conjured then that's how long you have to go without it. Example: would be keeping the sword out for an hour. Once you put the sword away then you have to wait another hour to summon it. 
When you add size or length to your blade by taking another material it will only stay that length for a minute </TEXT>

<TEXT> I came up with this the other day and you can use and improve upon it. Transmuters your nen into a gas muscle relaxer and number. Or you can transmute to a muscle stimulater, partially enhancer.  Both of these gases don't have any affect on you but by only a touch on a persons skin it can make them useless. An example of how this is helpful would be if you're fighting gon and he uses jajanken while you can't dodge. Block while coating your arms in muscle relaxer so after his attack he can't use that arm anymore. Change it to however you see fit </TEXT>

One cool way to fight would be to have both arms full of air, have your right hand palm up and shoot a small stream of air. The other hand shoots air at the other  stream to make it curve around his fist. Would basically make a continuous air force field around the first. wouldn't work irl but hell its an anime who cares.

Look at Killua, he was able to fend off youpi for some time even though he wouldn't have won that fight.

<TEXT> I have manipulator and I would manipulate position. 
Summary: So basically when my nen touches something im able to switch it with anything of equal size for 15minutes, after that the nen is reset. If I wanna put a full human where a box is I could use excess air around the box to make my nen be big enough to switch the human with the box and that air. Max amount of "items" my nen can keep contact with is 25.

How to use: I would use throwing knives with my nen on them to spread my nen to places out of my reach or hit enemies without getting close.

Special abilities: Gods World is where I use En,  you'd want en about the same size as nobunagas atleast, and basically I can switch the positions of myself or anything in my circle of en with anything in my circle. This can only go on for about 3-4 minutes. If someone were to charge me while I have gods world, the second they step inside my en I could switch them with the air beside me and attack on my own terms.

Positives: works great when with a group. If you have touched your friends you can move them to attack or away from danger like pieces on a chess board. Teamwork is golden. Also once you get the upper hand, nen on the enemy, it's basically a win. Great support skill.

Negatives: Extremely weak against quick people and one on one fights. If the enemy is faster than the user then they can stay away from your Gods world and easily dodge throwing knives. It eats up aura quickly if you are keeping tabs on multiple objects.

<TEXT> This wasn't pretentious at all. What you said is actually very well thought out. I do have one thing that goes against him being an air fighter, that's his sword style and how he thinks to use en more than the average hunter. His sword style is one that's meant to be stationary, if you've ever seen katanagatari there is a character with the same sword style and he's most powerful in a small room where he basically sits down or stands still. Does that ring a bell? Everything you've said about agility is right but his actual style of fighting goes against that sadly. But I do wanna see a fighter who fights the way you said. </TEXT>

But we still don't know of his actual nen ability. We know he's an enhancer that relies on speed rather than strength. We also know that his ability can be replaced easily which makes it seem like it is more of a fighting ability rather than utility.  So what do you think his ability could be?

<TEXT> I mean yes Killua has strong ties to gon and would never betray him but even his inner monologues show signs of him being in fear of gons strength. Like before gon fought pitou, Killua was actually scared of gon. Now imagine what would happen if Killua feels betrayed by the one he loves most, gon. Killua is almost in denial when it comes to how he thinks of gon. Gon isn't the beautiful human being Killua once thought and Killua is terrified every time that thought is challenged.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>  So basically here it is. Gon and Killua are foils of each other since gon is a normal hero going on his journey while Killua is a tragic hero. At the moment Gon can't use nen and Killua is in his version of peace with alluka. This just isn't right with there characters. My theory is that during the time during the dark continent where we can't see gon and Killua, gon will get his nen back but it will he unstable and he will have a new really OP ability. Eventually he will refind Killua and they will venture with alluka to the dark continent as well. Somewhere in that arc Gon will truly surpass Killua and at another place alluka will die and Killua will be distraught. Alluka will die in a way where gon could be responsible. With Gon's strength scaring Killua, Killua will fear and resent gon. Eventually Killua will try to overcome his fear and fight Gon in blind emotion. Thus the fight that silva predicted will commence. Thoughts? It's not the greatest theory, any tips. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My favorite is Manipulation. I see a lot of people not liking it because togashi hasn't shown enough cool abilities with it. One thing I don't think most people think about is what all you can manipulate. People are stuck thinking you can only manipulate objects but imagine if you can manipulate air, Gravity, your aging or even space itself by switching objects with equal mass around. I think in the new continent were going to see what makes manipulation so powerful. I see it as one of the abilities with the most possibilities yet to be explored. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got manipulator and mine would be similar to a space manipulation. It would be called Switch. Basically if My nens touched something in 6 minutes max then I can switch it with something else of equal size. If I had multiple throwing knives and threw them at a foe, my nen would touch the air that the throwing knife touched. So if he dodged the knife I could just switch it with the air and then it's in front of my enemy again. If I want to switch a person I would have to touch them and then be touching rubble or something similar to switch. It's a strategic ability best used when in a team. I have to say switch every time I switch something, I must be using GYO at all time in order to see what my nen touched and I have to know the name of what I'm switching. Thoughts? </TEXT>

Micheal was the main focus for a long time so him leaving makes less cringe style comedy he brings to the table.

But the development in those final seasons are beautiful and the show feels unfinished without it. </TEXT>
