<TEXT> These were made quite by mistake and easily by using 2x the amount of butter in a standard shortbread cookie recipe. They flattened out nicely and were buttery and crisp. You could adjust to taste I'm sure. I added chocolate ganache to the center. Finished w/ powder sugar. I also melted the butter, instead of softening.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is what the couples want, looks nice in photos. When your wedding day is over all you have left is the pics. This isn't some high class catering gig where people are dishing out thousands of bucks. It's wood fired pizza and apps. These are cool, relaxed people who love everything we do. You're right though, without the flowers and micro I probably could have fit one more tacky cheese cube on there.  </TEXT>
