<TEXT> Call who? Is there just one company to rule them all? If I choose a utility I.e. Water I don't think WE energies can set me up with that. I was more or less curious about what utilities I'd be looking at setting up, just trying to make a list of everything I have to set up before the big move day!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If there's already a thread for this I'd love to be pointed in the right direction but as for now these are my questions!
What utilities do I need and what do I do?
Vague I know but this is the first time I'm renting a place that doesn't have them included so I never had to set up accounts for electricity/gas/internet, I asked my new landlord but I didn't want to seem unprofessional or give any negative impressions as a tenant. she told me pretty much how to set up electric but i feel like there's more to it, maybe I'm just over thinking it. Any advice in general for someone who is renting or moving to another state (moving from NY to WI) would be abundantly appreciated! 
Thank you!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think there's a way we can clarify any doubts anyone had about the stream. We weren't going to dive head first into a pool of horror inexperienced in what we were doing. We played the demo on LSD before (and several other experiences) and that didn't even prepare us for the first interaction with the family which I can't unfortunately portray the speed of my heart or the way my brain works on LSD during those specific moments. If anything the LSD I think made me focus and react quicker and had I not taken it I wouldn't have progressed in some points out of fear alone. We Truly enjoyed the stream regardless if you believe us or not and the internet is full of skeptics so I don't blame you, had it been the reverse I would have thought the same. Over all thanks for watching,  we will probably stream more, sober, sometime and as boring as that might sound maybe we will see some of you! Thanks! And also the game is amazing in VR and I truly believe the stream or watching from any other perspective other than inside the headset does not even begin to give this game justice.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> See if you can talk to a realtor in the areas you're looking to move to. You don't wanna move anywhere with low job opportunities and only have $45000 with no job. I'd also see if you can have a job set up before you make the transition. If you play your cards right I think you'd have enough. A realtor can also help you figure out cost of moving/living  </TEXT>
