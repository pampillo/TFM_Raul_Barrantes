<TEXT> No, Lorne Michaels did not produce **The Blues Brothers** (1980).

That is a verifiable fact.  And think about it, where the heck would a young Lorne Michaels had the muscle and/or funding to jump on a major Universal Studios project in 1979?  

Anyway you might find this interesting: http://vhsrewind.com/vintage-cable-box-the-blues-brothers-1980/ </TEXT>

<TITLE> Do you consider Ghostbusters (2016) to be an SNL movie? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Do you consider Ghostbusters (2016) to be an SNL movie?

It was rather clever, since the original 1984 Ghostbusters featured a few SNL alumni, but the 2016 remake has many more:

Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones, Kate McKinnon, Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, Cecily Strong.

Of course this film isn't a feature version of an SNL skit but do you consider the 2016 **Ghostbusters** as an SNL film anyway, due to the cast?

Thank you. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is Carl Hiaasen's latest book, Razor, any good? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Miami Herald columnist Carl Hiaasen has been writing a novel about every three years since 1985.  I've read all of them except for Nature Girl (2006) and the latest work and agree with the general consensus that the quality of the books has dropped markedly since 2000.

Have any of you read the latest volume?  I myself haven't heard a thing about it "on the street" or word of mouth.

Thanks. </TEXT>

What would you say this would be more distinct from films of the first decade of the century? How would you say film has evolved since 2001?

Such as the films of Nicolas W. Refn.

And Under the Skin (2014), Enemy (2013).

<TEXT>  Fox and Friends now have the ear of a feeble minded and easily influenced President of the United States. So while the network may not succeed in brainwashing many, they are extremely influential and are currently helping to shape US domestic and foreign policy.

This is something we have to keep an eye on, for sure.  (It's still unclear, however, how much personal influence Trump has on actually crafting policy.)  Respectfully speaking, and I do appreciate your thoughts, this does go a bit beyond the scope of the OP, which concerned the electorate, not state policy.  But yeah, I agree with you, with the caveat that the President seems to watch all manner of cable news, not just Fox.  Didn't Elijah Cummings get the President to contact him based on an MSNBC "shout out"? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  As for today's influence, I don't believe their intent is to win over new votes as much; It was to create and now to reinforce a mindset in their viewers which demands party affiliated purity over reason, debate, and compromise on policy.

I totally agree with you here.  (In my opinion) Fox's influence is manifest on *internal* Republican affairs, particularly in heavily gerrymandered districts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Neoliberals prefer evidence-based policy and discussion.

Why does it seem that the impression of many neoliberals concerning Fox News is totally out of whack with the *evidence* of the power and reach of Fox News (the evidence is 1) the ratings, and 2) viewer demographics.)

It is not uncommon for my neoliberal friends to ascribe all manner of ills to Fox News.  They say "the influence of Fox News CANNOT be overstated."  (why, yes, it can.)  I also know of another quite well-educated and articulate person who is convinced that "over half the country only gets its news from Fox News."  If that were true, then Fox News would have a viewership base of 150 million people!  

The way I see it, Fox News has a viewership of about 3 million people, the vast majority, if not all, of them are right wing conservatives anyway.  Fox News is not "influencing" -- and certainly not brainwashing -- any liberal, moderate, or undecided voters.  Furthermore, these 3 millions of viewers amount to less than 1% of the U.S. population.  MTV in the 1980's reached a higher percentage of viewers than that!  (I bring up MTV since it WAS a genuine cultural phenomenon in the 1980's.)

Am I wrong?  What are your evidence-based thoughts? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Mr. Trumps toothless action is the inevitable consequence of years spent scaring white evangelicals with faux outrages. A problem with no victims requires nothing more than a solution with no substance. All Mr. Trump had to do was host some religious leaders in his garden, listen politely to some Christian contemporary music, repeat some religious-right talking points about how free speech doesnt end at the steps of a cathedral and voil! He becomes the savior of American Christianity.

Love it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Yet even as Mr. Trump spoke in the Rose Garden on Thursday, the reaction in the conservative Christian world was one of disappointment. Total weak sauce, fumed David French at National Review. The evangelical pastor Skye Jethani tweeted, A whole lot of nothing; a symbolic act to please his base without any real change in policy or law. Robert George, a conservative Catholic intellectual, called the order a betrayal.

 Thats because the executive order changes absolutely nothing. </TEXT>

I'm not trying to antagonize you here (i'm new to this sub) but many folks on both the left and right are starting to think that neoliberals are indifferent to income and wealth inequality.  The percentage of voters who likewise think that neoliberals "are in the pocket of Wall Street" is also higher today than it was ten years ago.

<TEXT> Very well said!  I think you hit the nail on the head.

One point of confusion is that the definition of "conservative" changes over time.  On the other hand, the specific, finite, ideology represented in NR (tax cuts, anti-Communism, states rights, etc.) actually has a specific name, namely "movement conservatism."  Movement conservatism is indeed dying or is already dead.

Meanwhile, the term "conservative" lives on, and shorn of even the feeblest ideological pretense, morphs into "drrr whatever Trump wants do to today . . . "   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well if you really believe that "[s]tupid, easily distracted, easily mislead [sic], weak-minded Americans hav[e] more voting power than their more educated counterparts" -- maybe it's time to start predicting that Democrats will never win another presidential election ever again.

Then again I'd have to question just how intelligent you are when you think that recent -- and near landslide -- Democratic wins in the nearly same "stupid, easily distracted" electorate is "irrelevant."

Pathetic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  law school, passing the bar, practicing with the Children's Defense Fund

None of that means jack shit in the larger scheme of things.  This isn't 1888 when most people didn't make it past third grade.  However, Clinton did graduate from Wellesley and Yale Law School, which are impressive schools.  But in general, graduating law school and passing the bar are not major "accomplishments" in and of themselves.  Even less so now than in the 1970's.

On the other hand, the First Lady, Senator, Secy of State, yeah, that's fantastic. </TEXT>

Hell, it wasn't too long ago when many commentators were seriously discussing that the GOP would never win another presidential election ever again, even in a system where "[s]tupid, easily distracted, easily mislead [sic], weak-minded Americans hav[e] more voting power than their more educated counterparts." </TEXT>

This is a double edged sword since it increases minority representation in Congress, but also dilutes the minority vote overall. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A lot of my fellow lefties complain about gerrymandering.  Gerrymandering has been around for centuries but has gotten a lot more "efficient" because of computer technology.

If the Democrats/liberals can re-capture some state legislatures and governor seats by 2020 they can gerrymander their own Democrat-friendly district maps for the entire decade of the 2020's -- and presumably the computer software we can use in 2021 will be even more powerful than the software the GOP used in 2011.  

Is this the wrong way to think about the issue? </TEXT>
