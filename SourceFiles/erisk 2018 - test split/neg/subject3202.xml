<TITLE> Can we talk about the N word in books? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 23:14:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I like when authors don't shy away from using these words in their work. America has a sordid past and we can't shy away from it. In fact, we have become so sensitive that the mere version of the vanilla version of the word is considered *offensive*. 


* * * * * *


There, I said it. Is the sky falling? Is the world in flames? *Did I just even hurt anybody?*. No no and no. And yet, I bet this post will be removed, and I will be banned. But you know what? That's a price I'm willing to pay to get my point across. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like, let's say the show is not erotica but instead an action, mystery or horror or whatever.  But see, the main character in this show is an utter slut. Sleeping with strangers, offering blowjobs behind bars at 3am, that kind of stuff. The plot would not revolve around that, but who's to say that the main character can't shove things in places where things aren't meant to be shoved?

This show, IMO, is up there with the likes of True Detective and The Killing. I want to say though, that I quickly grew fond of Julien Baptiste. He was such a good man and I like that he had a really good heart, it's refreshing to see after all the gruff type detectives lately. I highly recommend this show, 10/10 </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why does Hannibal get a pass for fake outs? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-24 00:49:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Everyone always complaining about fake out deaths in TV shows (notably TWD) when Hannibal did it not once, but *twice*. Once in S2, when Hannibal cuts and maims every major character but none of them dies except a secondary character, and in season 3 when Hannibal and Will jump off a cliff. Now, you could say that, since the series might not come back, then yes, Will and Hannibal could be dead, maybe not. But that goes out the window when people involved in the show have expressed desire for more seasons, and if that happens then you bet your ass they gonna bring Hannibal and Will back. All in all, Hannibal always had superb writing, acting and direction, but it always struck me as odd how they made these huge fake out deaths but nobody seems to criticize them for it. I thought it was cheap, especially in season 2 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today I've played with 2 kind of people . I'm not by any means good at this game, so when I had to clutch it in a 1v4 on Ranked I was nervous as hell. My teammate in that match disagreed with every decision I made, and he let me know of that fact with somewhat strong language- calling me an idiot, a dumbass, ect...

He just was very negative and I ended up dying without killing anyone. But a couple of games later, the same situation arose in a different map, Oregon. This time though, I had a supportive teammate. I knew I made some screw ups, but
 let me know in a friendly manner. He checked the cams, gave me info, and was generally very supportive.  I didn't end up clutching it, but I managed to take 3 of them with me before getting killed by Mira. And we still won 4-2. We can learn something from that: being a standout teammate isn't just about soaking up kills. Sure, the asshole teammate ended up with a bunch of kills, but we lost. While this positive guy ended up negative, he made up for it by providing special support to our team. </TEXT>

This show was so good that I didn't mind reading subtitles at all. It's one of my favorite crime shows out there and I can't wait for season 3. Even if you don't like The Wire give it a chance because the show is completely different but it also takes a good look at the criminal underworld. 

Seriously, watch it.

<TEXT> There are games where I do very well. In the last 4 days I've been able to reach MVP with 6+ kills a couple of times a day. But on average I find I'm making poor decisions. I guess my average game I go 4-2, or 1-2, or 2-4 seem to be very common. A couple of times a day (or even more) I go 1-4 or something like that. I find that I'm inconsistent. And when I do good sometimes I feel like I get lucky. 


My main Operators are: 

Defense:

Pulse

Jger

(Mostly use these for roaming)


Mute


Kapkan



On attack, I use:

Ash


Sledge



Twitch 



Honestly I find that sometimes I do pretty good (got a 8-0 yesterday with a 1 v 4 clutch) but other times I do so bad it's almost embarrassing. Is there any universal tip on how to do better? I feel like what I'm having the most trouble with is outsmarting my enemy </TEXT>

It's very good I like that the game is very realistic and the graphics are amazing I like how you actually have to think tactically and mold your style of gameplay according to the situation  However I wish more people would use their mics lol but I do admit that more people use them in this game than most I've played in xbox the only thing I don't like is how sometimes you get teamkilled over some bullshit however it makes it realistic becuese in real life you can't just spray like in cod An in all, very good game </TEXT>

<TEXT> A little off topic, but it would blow my mind if I was reading Malazan in public and the book picked someone's interest enough for them to seek out the series. I'm glad you found it. Have fun. The books are amazing. 


As to the books, when I read them I knew I was probably not absorbing everything but honestly that doesn't matter for your first time through. The books themselves are rather easy to read if you just relaxed and let the story flow, it just requires a little more concentration than most mediums. Just imagine it's a movie and don't worry about the rest. From book 2 onwards, every book feels like reading 3 Tolkien novels, with an explosive climax for each and everyone, maybe less so for the last 2 books since they're the same last story. And you'll understand and enjoy, just don't expect to understand *everything*.  </TEXT>
