<TITLE> [Spoilers]John Green - Paper Towns is one of the very few books I decided not to finish </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 00:46:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I love young adult fiction, but this book has both the central characters so underdeveloped that I cringe reading it. I have no problem with undeveloped charachters provided the book does not take itaelf seriously.  John Green tried to shove the ' friends since kids and love was always there around the corner 'trope down my throat. The superawesome girl flees home and its upto the dorky childhood destined lover to save her, while she leaves literary and pop clues for him to find her out. I cant take it anymore. Guys please share ur thoughts if you have read it. Last year I read ' The sky is everywhere' and 'All the bright places' and I loved them, so I did know what I was signing up for, but this I couldnt take. Or if you want to tell about a book that made you puke, you are welcome too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys, saw this movie yesterday. I highly recommend it if you like stylish action movies. Its one of Luc Besson's early movies but all the signature notes are there. Has a great 80's background score too and he has used it lavishly. I could recognize some of the  french actors from their other movies too, Jean Reno, Jean-Hugues Anglade. Do share your thoughts. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys so the joke goes like My town never changes population. Every time a girl gets pregnant, a guy leaves town. So it is an assumption that no one dies, hence population can either increase or be constant. My intuition says that in the long run the town will be overrun by females. Can some one prove that mathematically. Also, if that is the case then there would be a case where there are 99 females and one male in the town. In that case what could be the chances of a female being related to the male, assuming that in the start there were 50 males and 50 females all unrelated. Assume no twins etc. being born also. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think one way to get an answer for your question is look into the current job openings at companies like GE,Vestas, Siemens (for wind energy), First Solar, Solar City etc. (for solar), let us say Tesla (for storage). I personally find roughly 30% of these positions for project leaders/coordinators (they do ask for work experience in similar fields though), but it might help you make an informed decision. Recently I was checking the careers site for [NREL](https://nrel.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/NREL) which is the leading research institute for renewables right ? and not all jobs are for engineers. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, I am half way through the book and observed that  death uses paraprosdokians (I am not fully sure if it is the right term) to perfection, I love his observations. An example:

"When death captures me, the boy vowed, he will feel my fist on his face. Personally I quite like that. Such stupid gallantry. Yes. I like that a lot."

What are your observations about the author's style, do any other writers resemble it ?

<TEXT> I'm glad he ignores your pleas he knows you better, reminded me of a poem I read a long time ago:

Little One don't be afraid of this big river,

Be safe in those warm arms forever,

Grow tall my child, be wise and strong,

But do not take from any man his song,

Little one, don't be afraid of this dark night,

Walk boldly as you see the truth and light,

Love well my child, laugh all day long,

But do not take from any man his song."

-Ruskin Bond </TEXT>

<TEXT> My feeling exactly, it is a decent book, but I also expected an epiphany in the end, never came. I have the same feeling  while watching a David Lynch movie,  but I can come to beautiful conclusions by discussing it with other viewers. Will try to search for more explanations. Thanks for your detailed reply, I had not finished the book then, hence the late reply. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks, you are right to me, that made the characters real. That is how affairs and flings happen in real life, due to human weakness. I would rather see this kind of a movie than when people act larger than life.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey Guys, just saw this movie. From now on, I'll always post this this when people talk of romantic movies. Sometimes there is a movie with nothing new in the story but the rest of its aspects are sublime. It is shot in the beautiful Iowa country side and is about a housewife and mother (Meryl Streep) who gives up her dreams for her family  and how she finds a love (Clint Eastwood) 'with a certainity that comes once in a lifetime'. Wow, Mr. Eastwood has directed some amazing movies. Another thing about the movie is it was made in 1995 and takes you back to 80s countryside. 1995 was some year for the movies - Braveheart, Toy Story, Seven, Apollo 13, 12 moneys, The Usual Suspects, Dead Man Walking, Babe, Leaving Las Vegas. If it was upto movie I would give all these movies an Oscar anyday. 

PS -I don't remember Clint playing any romantic roles really and there was this scene when Meryl asks him "What were you like when you were young ?" and he answers "Trouble." Yeah Well :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Guys, just saw this hilarious movie, I loved it. I did not understand why in the end Klara checks to ensure Klarik is not bow-legged. It thought everyone knew by then that Vadas was a phony and he spread lies about Kralik being bow-legged. I mean she got both the guys in one right, the letter writer and the guy she had a crush on. Is it just a comic ending or is it supposed to mean that she might have ditched Kralik, if he did turn out to be bow-legged. Thank you :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Guys, so I always read while travelling, its a very old habit. Whenever I spot a fellow reader ( books ofc, not magazines/newspaper), I get this uncontrollable urge to see what they are reading. Sometimes, I have noticed people reading one of my favourite books also, but I never get the courage to discuss it with them. However a few times other people have asked me about what I was reading, in such instances, I feel really happy but in the excitement, I have never been fully able to communicate what the book is about. I do however manage to convey to some extent how the book makes me feel. What are your experiences in this regard, any interesting anecdotes are welcome. </TEXT>

There is no point in shining higher wavelengths which will not be converted to electricity and will contribute only to heat. However I do not understand the momentum explanation by /u/HugodeGroot.

<TEXT> Hi guys, I hardly understood this book. I understood that characters were drunk and hallucinating most of the time. Actually, I skip these kind of passages in most books and don't try too much to find meaning in them, but this whole book was full of it. What I did follow was Joel had to come back to his father who was wounded and paralyzed by Randolph who is a homosexual (and a pedophile maybe ?). Joel is disillusioned because his step mother and Randolph are drunk and hide his father from him (why'd they do that ?). In the end Joel resigns himself to his fate because he got ill while running from home. There is a lot about the hermit I don't get and who was the woman that Joel kept imagining in the window ?. I decided to read this after having read 'In cold Blood' which I really liked. I can't bring myself to believe both the books are written by the same person. What are your thoughts on the book, what am I missing ? Thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry for the late reply, what I mean is you cannot integrate along theta and phi directions with a r vector inside the integral (r vector keeps changing direction). Integration is just summation right, and you can add things in the same direction only. So split your ar^ vector in 2 directions, one perpendicular to the base of the hemisphere, one in plane of the hemisphere. Only the components perpendicular to the hemispherical base get added up. The components in the plane of the hemisphere get cancelled. So going back to maths right your ar^ vector as -acos k^ + asin i^ , your final result will be in -k^ direction. With the additional cos term inside the integral you will get the correct answer. More questions are welcome, I dont agree with /u/Indian_Nazi, no method can be written off. For a certain type of application your method may be the best way.

Edit : http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/363780/how-to-integrate-a-vector-function-in-spherical-coordinates This will help you </TEXT>

<TEXT> Read about relative velocity and you will understand better. Intuitively you may also realize that when if T1 and T2 move towards each other T1 will observe T2 to be moving much faster than if it was much stationary. So, velocity of T2 with respect to T1 is vel(T1) + vel(T2). (note -If they were moving in same direction there would be a minus sign in the middle)

Now for both the persons the opposite train is moving with the same velocity 100+120 = 220 km/h

so length of train for passenger in T2 = velocity * time = 220*6/3600 [km]

w.r.t  passenger in T1 speed is again the same, so time = Distance/velocity = (220*6/3600) / (220) = 6/3600 [hrs] = 6 sec </TEXT>

For x direction a =0, For y direction a = -9.8 m /s^2 = -g

So equation for y direction is:


y = vt - 1/2 * g * t^2

v = y/t + 1/2 * g * t

PS - If  is calculated from say pt1 to pt2, then v   u are at point 1 in these equations. So after u cross the top point, y will start getting negative values.

Thus,  =  from your 2nd equation

However first equation is not correct for equilibrium of point B:

T_AB cos+ T_CB cos = F2 = 1000

Thus, cos = 1000/1800 = 5/9

tan = sqrt(1/ cos^2  -1) = 2/5 * sqrt(14) = 2/x

x = 5/sqrt(14)

<TEXT> Guys, I have a related question how can /u/Bricejohnson2003 decide what MW of solar farm is possible on 400 acres let us say if investment is not a criterion. I thought there were 2 possible ways to go about it :

1)Oklhoma has an average irradiance of 5kWh / m^2 / day, so with 0.15 efficiency it is possible to produce .75kWh / m^2 /day. So for 400  acres (1.6 mil m^2) 1200MWh / day. If there is 8 hrs of sunlight, the power of the farm is 150 MW.

2) The other way is lets say he wants to use 250W panels to cover the whole area, now a single 250W panel has an approximate area of 1.6 m^2, so total MW possible = 250 MW.

My question is which way is the correct method or is there a third criterion ? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes your logic is correct, the measure (say x) to compare all pizzas is Area per unit price.

So you calculate this x for each option and maximum x is the option you choose. Only thing you can avoid is multipkying pi each time as it is common, i.e. x can be defined as diameter^2 / price.

Edit : The method proposed by u/cornholio702 is correct as well but he is taking price/area so u pick minimum

<TEXT> Guys, I just saw the movie Dredd and was wondering which other actresses in Hollywood can pull off an evil villain like our queen Cersie can. I am in awe of this lady. When I think of lady villains Kathy Bates (Misery) comes to mind, maybe Meryl Streep (Devil Wears) Michelle Pfeiffer (Stardust). What other actresses do you think have the charisma and the ability to be a central evil figure in a movie ? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I shall try for G to F, you can use the same method for C :

100 units of G  = 997 -32 = 965 units of F

1 unit of G = 9.65 times unit scale of F

so, (G-0)*9.65 = F-32

so, G = (F-32)/9.65 </TEXT>

<TEXT> The way you are trying is much better for understanding, this might be a bit algorithmic :

1) It is good enough to prove prove LHS-RHS0, so lets say we have a function y= x^2 - 2x + 2

2) The minima of this function is at x  =1

3) y(1) =1, hence y = 1 for all x, in our case y = 0 will suffice

4) coshx  x^2 /2 + 1 from expansion series hence coshX  x </TEXT>

I would also like to add that the heat also had a very important part in the riot, i.e. racial tension is not a result of plain hatred but poverty, illiteracy for which the current generation is not entirely responsible. The movie is a critique on mob mentality, I can't remember any other movie which shows mob in action like this one. I worked in a factory where trade unions were very powerful and during strikes this is  very close to the way mob behaved. </TEXT>

So the lesson for Tyrion was hide your secrets to death, Tywin literally proved it. Ofcourse he is a evil hypocritical sob, but he is also everything that a survivor of that cut-throat medieval world should be. Also, he was mad at Tyrion for all the reasons that Tyrion claims in season 4, keeping him from away from girls was just another way to inflict pain on him, it had nothing to do with morality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 8mm, a perfect movie in its genre. The movie starts on a sunny beach in Miami but the background score is so melancholy that I knew this is going to be sth special and it really was.

<TEXT> You are right that is even more accurate i.e use the expansion for tan^(-1) x and compute upto 3 terms to get a good value by putting x as sqrt(1/2). In my previous comment, I was thinking more like tanx = sqrt(1/2)
thus, cosx = sqrt (2/3)
thus, 1-x^2 / 2 = sqrt(2/3)
thus, x = sqrt(2-sqrt(8/3))
thus, x~0.6 </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do not know much about the job market, but most schools teaching renewable energy have special courses for integration of renewables in the society. I think a psychology degree will be very useful in these cases. For eg. one of the things that hold BIPV is people think that the value of their houses will go down if they put PVs on top. So actually the technologies are all there, people just need to believe in them more. So  I would say if you enroll in some programs and look to marketing of renewables, your background won't go to waste. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My opinion :
1) POV - if the antagonist is the narrator, he already has the sympathies of the audience  irrespective of his moral code etc., I don't know why that is
2) Sympathy - If the anti-hero is the way he is because of the 
audience's (society's) actions even if passively
3)Justice/Fairness : Audience is often seen to forgive a character who takes the law in his hands to deliver justice, a bit out of context for the clockwork orange ofcourse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Guys, there is this scene between two guys where  a European guy tells an American why they are always unhappy. It is because the idea of American dream weighs too heavy on them. The essence is that it is the capitalism which says that anyone can achieve anything irrespective of luck and this makes Americans unhappy. These are not the exact words, it is what I understood from the scene. In-fact, it may not have been a conversation between two people but discussion between a group of Europeans. I don't remember if the film is Hollywood or not. But I can say with certainty that it is a renown movie. Thank you for trying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Guys there is an episode where Ross mimics phoebe, he begins with "ooh ooooh" and then some blah blah. Actually, I was thinking that Phoebe kind of bullies (maybe a strong word) him a lot, and this is one of the few times he kinda had her speechless. Help me remember it, have been thinking of it for a week.

Oh I found it on google, its 'the one where underdog gets away', the conversation goes like:


PHOEBE: Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?

ROSS: Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want 
      to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner. </TEXT>

They know every house (as it was before we bombarded the village with 12 inch shells). They know every yard where every man is to go and they have passed most of it on to me. Tonight in the dark we assemble  brigades and brigades and more and more brigades  tomorrow in the pale dawn we go over the lid. Montauban is a mile or so away  we the 17 take Montauban. It is an honoured post  there is a soldiers song running through my head  we were singing it last night   I cant get it out of the head.

<TEXT> I laughed out loud when I read this, a conversation with Cersie, Jaime and Pycelle
    Pycelle looked desperately uncomfortable. There has been a bird, he said. From Stokeworth. Lady Tanda sends word that her daughter Lollys has been delivered of a strong, healthy son.
 And you will never guess what they have named the little bastard, brother.
 They wanted to name him Tywin, I recall.
  Yes, but I forbade it. I told Falyse that I would not have our fathers noble name bestowed upon the ill-gotten spawn of some pig boy and a feeble-witted sow.
Lady Stokeworth insists the childs name was not her doing, Grand Maester Pycelle put in. Perspiration dotted his wrinkled forehead. Lollyss husband made the choice, she writes. This man Bronn, he  it would seem that he 
Tyrion, ventured Jaime. He named the child Tyrion.
The old man gave a tremulous nod, mopping at his brow with the sleeve of his robe.
Jaime had to laugh. There you are, sweet sister. You have been looking everywhere for Tyrion, and all the time hes been hiding in Lollyss womb.
 Droll. You and Bronn are both so droll. No doubt the bastard is sucking on one of Lollys Lackwits dugs even as we speak, whilst this sellsword looks on, smirking at his little insolence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry it's a bit long, but this is one of the few instances when all stark kids are together, and it's a kind of childhood memory that usually siblings share, I'm sure if you have brothers/sisters/close friends as kids then this will remind you of them:
Fear cuts deeper than swords, the quiet voice inside her whispered. Suddenly Arya remembered the crypts at Winterfell. They were a lot scarier than this place, she told herself. She'd been just a little girl the first time she saw them. Her brother Robb had taken them down, her and Sansa and baby Bran, who'd been no bigger than Rickon was now. They'd only had one candle between them, and Bran's eyes had gotten as big as saucers as he stared at the stone faces of the Kings of Winter, with their wolves at their feet and their iron swords across their laps.
Robb took them all the way down to the end, past Grandfather and Brandon and Lyanna, to show them their own tombs. Sansa kept looking at the stubby little candle, anxious that it might go out. Old Nan had told her there were spiders down here, and rats as big as dogs. Robb smiled when she said that. "There are worse things than spiders and rats," he whispered. "This is where the dead walk." That was when they heard the sound, low and deep and shivery. Baby Bran had clutched at Arya's hand.
When the spirit stepped out of the open tomb, pale white and moaning for blood, Sansa ran shrieking for the stairs, and Bran wrapped himself around Robb's leg, sobbing. Arya stood her ground and gave the spirit a punch. It was only Jon, covered with flour. "You stupid," she told him, "you scared the baby," but Jon and Robb just laughed and laughed, and pretty soon Bran and Arya were laughing too.
The memory made Arya smile, and after that the darkness held no more terrors for her. The stableboy was dead, she'd killed him, and if he jumped out at her she'd kill him again. She was going home. Everything would be better once she was home again, safe behind Winterfell's grey granite walls. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Death should hold no fear for a man as old as me, but it does. Isn't that silly? It is always dark where I am, so why should I fear the darkness? Yet I cannot help but wonder what will follow, when the last warmth leaves my body. Will I feast forever in the Father's golden hall as the septons say? Will I talk with Egg again, find Dareon whole and happy, hear my sisters singing to their children? What if the horselords have the truth of it? Will I ride through the night sky forever on a stallion made of flame? Or must I return again to this vale of sorrow? Who can say, truly? Who has been beyond the wall of death to see? Only the wights, and we know what they are like. We know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If Roose himself proclaims that Ramsay is his son, then what's there to question him ? Everyone assumes that wartime news has a lot of confusion. Iirc, the team sent to depose Ramsay got massacred at winterfell right when they tried to take the castle back from Theon, so who is to confirm the story that they killed someone who looked exactly like Ramsay. Further, well if Northmen didn;t question as to why Roose murdered Robb, then why should they have the guts to question him about son ? Maybe there is more factual evidence but this is all I could construct. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was an illustrated book, I read it in early 90s. It was printed in landscape. I remember a lot of drawings had a moon, and a guy wore a clown cap. I think he was supposed to be cunning/evil. The story may have been about hiding/stealing the moon. Chances are the book was by some English author. I was a kid and my sister got the book from her school (which btw leaned towards christanity). I used to read it a lot. The drawings had a black background and were mostly done with white and had little color. Sometimes I think this is my earliest childhood memory, it would be great help if someone tells me the name of the book. </TEXT>

I tend to agree with the conclusion and liking/hating for me is more a matter of whether I identify with the character. I don't care either whether he does evil or good so long as I feel I would have done exactly the same in his situation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys, I read this book about 5 years ago. It was not contemporary. Most probably by an English writer. There was this guy who leaves town (England) because his best girl can't marry him due to some reason. He goes to Switzerland and has an affair with an air hostess where he poses as a doctor. His girl visits him in Switzerland later it is revealed that the narrator cheated the readers by not revealing the full truth about himself at all, as he knocked up the girl before leaving town. He comes back to England seeking redemption and stuff. Thanks for the help. </TEXT>

Though, I don't understand why an actor when he plays someone with a disability (Daniel Day Lewis, Eddie Redmayne), he gets really a lot of attention and praise, I think it has also something to do with sympathy for the character played along with the acting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think we can judge whether a person is a hypocrite or not only if we have a POV chapter, being a Hypocrite is about lying to yourself right ? I mean if Robb's inner thinking goes like, "I did the honorable thing by married Jeyne" he is a hypocrite, but if it goes like, "Man, she was hot, I let my dick do my thinking, I fucked up", then he is not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read Ayn Rand when I just graduated, and I was really I influenced by objectivity and superlavitism. Seven years hence, I still feel it is very motivating what she said, but also realize that people cannot be that one dimensional and when life deals you really rotten cards, all the objectivity in the world change it, it just is what it is. GRRM's charachters on the contrast are I think are more realistic, because they are good and bad at the same time and face more real life dilemmas and confusions. In Rand's world there is no room for mediocrity and when one grows old and realizes that he didn't go into space or isn't the CEO of facebook, her books can't give him much solace ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reminded me of Jamie and how it snowed in the riverlands :
 When morning broke the snow was ankle deep, and deeper in the godswood, where drifts had piled up under the trees. Squires, stableboys, and highborn pages turned to children again under its cold white spell, and fought a snowball war up and down the wards and all along the battlements. Jaime heard them laughing. There was a time, not long ago, when he might have been out making snowballs with the best of them, to fling at Tyrion when he waddled by, or slip down the back of Cersei's gown. *You need two hands to make a decent snowball, though.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Needle was Robb and Bran and Rickon, her mother and her father, even Sansa. Needle was Winterfell's grey walls, and the laughter of its people. Needle was the summer snows, Old Nan's stories, the heart tree with its red leaves and scary face, the warm earthy smell of the glass gardens, the sound of the north wind rattling the shutters of her room. Needle was Jon Snow's smile. He used to mess my hair and call me "little sister," she remembered, and suddenly there were tears in her eyes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They why part is a bit difficult, but all the evidence pointed Jeoff. Actually it was not explicitly stated but both Jamie and Tyrion came to that conclusion each deducing separately. Actually Littlefinger said that the dagger was his and he lost to Tyrion in a bet that Jamie would loose in a tourney, but that was a lie because Tyrion was not there in KL and nobody could disprove it, later Tyrion tells Catelyn that he never bets against his family, he actually bet the dagger for Jamie and lost it to Robert (who always hopes to see Jamie get embarrassed). So now during the Winterfell visit the dagger is in Robert's possession. Tyrion confronts both Jamie and Cersie and they tell him they didn't sent the Catspaw, because it would be too risky and they thought Bran won't live anyway. Tyrion now bases his suspicion of Joffery on two things -i)Jeoff talks about killing wolves during one of his conversations at Winterfell ii) Jeoffery receives a Valyrion steel sword during his wedding and says he is no stranger to Valyrion steel, when Tyrion tryies to probe into that, he gets really angry and cuts the book Tyrion gives as a present, which was a gesture to say that Tyrion's days were numbered. Thus, Tyrion concludes that it was Jeoff. So the answer to "why" is, Jeoff is stupid and wanted Robert's attention because Robert once mentioned that Bran be ethunized. He didn't know about J+C </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I think it is better to make a good character wait for the right time than make him look ridiculous by unnecessary screen time. Peter Dinklage is a great actor and those scenes didnt do him justice, instead they could have used that time for developing intrigue </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think a battle between Dany and Jon can be avoided by the reveal, because he will have to bend the knee if there is no reveal if northmen don't want him to do so, he will have to fight Dany. In case his parentage is proven, Dany can easily form an alliance with him, because both Jon and Dany want to avoid violence as far as possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok I see , but I think all stark kids will get what they wanted, remember Jon wanted to be the lord of Winterfell since when he was a kid (he was overcome with emotion when Stannis made the proposal to him, he remembered how he had charged at Robb once while sword practice shouting winterfell, and Robb had said you can't be that). Arya wanted to be a warrior like the dragon sisters, she is definitely on the route, Bran wanted to be a knight and he will be the last hero right ?, the hero of the doomsday fight, Sansa will be a queen I think maybe at Casterly Rock with Tyrion...Ahh too much wishful thinking </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, i agree that the writers miss out on the inner struggles of the characters (Arya's 'hole where her heart was', Dany's 'if i look back i'm lost', Jon's 'kill the boy') but the guy in the video seems to think that the show is somehow tarnishing the spirit of books and that's going a bit too far imo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It makes sense when you say it, i agree that "the pack must stay together" is enforced more powerfully in Arya's context by GRRM. She is a leader, i don't doubt that either (the way she leads lommy, hot pie, gendry in riverlands). But, I always think of her as a rebel and a free spirit. Also, she can't advertise herself as a faceless assassin to get respect from the North, Jon may have it because he was the Lord commander, and is a proven warrior. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Guys, I came across this in the first book in a Bran chapter where it is described how Hodor used to carry Bran in a wicker basket - " Hodor seemed to like it too, though with hodor it was hard to tell. The only tricky part was doors. Sometimes Hodor forgot that he had Bran on his back, and that could be painful when he went through a door."... So hodor always forgot to hold the door for Bran, lol makes me wonder how many clues grrm has hidden in plain sight ! </TEXT>
