<TEXT> I don't count calories.  I eat to satiety.  For example, for breakfast I make a bowl of 4 eggs, 1/2 pound sausage, large cooking spoon of olive oil (about 8 tablespoons), 4 tablespoons of butter, and some veggies like carrots, and kale.  This is probably about 4,000 calories or so.  I eat as much as I can until I can't eat any more.  Typically, I will eat about half of it and save the rest for later.  Point is that I'm not hungry again for 6 hours or so.  This meal is nutrient dense and satiating.  I don't "diet" on feasting day.  Hormones are more important than calories.  If a person is hungry, they will eat.  If a person eats sugar and carbs, in an hour or so, they will be hungry again.  Regulating the hormones is very important. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fox News is in the "Business of Anger".  What should you be enraged about today?  There's an entire business...a huge industry, actually...that bases all that it does on getting you p!$$ed off! They are all variations of the same thing: people in an industry who want you to believe their function is to "move the public dialogue forward" or to "make an opinion count on your behalf"...blah blah blah. But NO!

Their sole function is to make you angry. That's right. Get your dander up. Get you riled up and feeling as though you're right and all those other asses are wrong - and stupid! In turn, they hope that you'll pay more and more attention to them - while they reinforce your growing anger and disillusionment - and give them big ratings and more money from their advertisers. It is a business.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Christians are used to being lied too. How do they tell which parts of the bible to follow, and which parts to ignore?

Matthew (27:52-53) "The graves were opened; and **MANY** bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto **MANY**." 

Hello historians! How'd you miss that? Zombies. Roaming around. Seen by **MANY**!!

Not a fucking peep about it anywhere but Matthew.

Seems legit.

Instead of paying $500-$1000 a month for a family, it is around $50-$100 a month. This is what my friends who live in other countries pay for healthcare for a family and they are getting the same thing Americans get, but we pay more. We also have to pay 10%-20% of the bill. WTF!! Their overall costs per person are lower because the insurance pool is much bigger when everyone is in it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like Dr. Jason Fung has said jokingly: you will lose muscle and become a ball of fat. /s What happens in famines (this happens to all mammals) is a person will go into ketosis and then ketones and HGH (increases 3 times normal) will protect muscles for a period of time. HGH signals the liver to make glucose which the brain and red blood cells need. The body will burn fat for fuel. Once a person gets to 4-5% body fat then bad things happen and the body will really start wasting muscle. Other bad physiological things will start to happen too.

<TEXT> The person consuming less calories will have their metabolic rate drop to balance the books after a few days eating less calories.  If they exercise, the metabolic rate will drop even further.  After about a week, they stop losing weight.  CICO stops working.  WTF! Steven Phinney found in a research project that a person sitting on a sofa for 4 to 5 weeks lost more weight than the people who did both (exercise and diet). However, people sitting on the sofa only lost weight in the first week and didn't lose more weight in the remaining weeks even thought they were eating a reduced calorie diet.

<TEXT> You will lose muscle and become a ball of fat.  /s  What happens in famines (this happens to all mammals) is a person will go into ketosis and then ketones and HGH (increases 3 times normal) will protect muscles for a period of time.  HGH signals the liver to make glucose which the brain and red blood cells need.  The body will burn fat for fuel.  Once a person gets to 4-5% body fat then bad things happen and the body will really start wasting muscle.  Other bad physiological things will start to happen too.

<TEXT> I think in a few years, the science will be weight loss and weight gain is all about hormones. Ghrelin, leptin, insulin and many others signal to the brain the body is hungry or full. Keto diet does a good job of stabilizing the hunger hormones. When I was eating low fat, high carb, I had to eat every 2-3 hours because I was hungry.  Obviously something was wrong because without grocery stores available this diet is not sustainable.  It is good for the food corporations.  Now, I can fast for 36 hours, no problem and not be hungry. It is crazy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good luck!  How can a person tell which calories are being used and which ones are stored?  Brown fat will burn calories in heat loss.  It is just wasted energy.  Some calories are stored into white fat mainly if insulin is present.  But if insulin is low then what?  Furthermore, GI doesn't absorb all the food that is eaten.  I guess if a person was in a metabolic room they can measure everything then get a good estimate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It doesn't spike insulin and it makes a person feel full so that will naturally not eat more food.  The fat also boost fat metabolism and ketone production.  If a person wishes to win, that is what they have to do.  It is simple, and really works.  CICO is BS!  That is not how the human body works.  Calorie restriction fails.  If a person reduces their calories, the body will slow metabolism.  A person can eat one meal a day.  This works for a 2-3 weeks in losing weight, but the body will adjust and then it stops working.  Metabolism will slow down. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The more fat the better.  After a few days you will feel full and not be hungry.  I buy a bottle of olive oil at Costco and use a large cooking spoon (about 8 tablespoons).  I will add the oil to what I am eating at breakfast.  Eating fat doesn't spike blood sugar and insulin.  It also will keep you from being hungry.  Macros are only a guide.  You need to experiment to find what really works for you.  If you are not hungry, try skipping meals.  Keep the insulin down, and body fat will drop.  Insulin is the key. </TEXT>

Further, local law enforcement can't hold people in jail waiting for federal authorities to pick them up without changing a person with a crime.  That is against a person's rights.  Where I live in Minnesota, the courts have said they can only hold a person in jail for no longer than 48 hours without charging them with a crime. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I lift several times a week, do long runs, and long bike rides.  From my experience with lifting, it is almost impossible to build muscle when fasting, but the HGH boost after day 3 of a fast is cool.  I have dead-lifted the most weight on day 5 of a fast.  I fast to stay lean, and the performance benefits for endurance are real.  I cycle between feasting and fasting.  I eat a keto diet and do 3-5 day fasts.  I don't eat much sugar and carbs because they make me puffy.  For myself, keto and fasting rock!

More info on HGH and fasting: https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/fasting-and-growth-hormone-physiology-part-3/
Brad Pilon is also a good resource for lifting and fasting.

Matthew (27:52-53) "The graves were opened; and MANY bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto MANY." 

Hello historians! How'd you miss that? Zombies. Roaming around. Seen by MANY!!

Not a fucking peep about it anywhere but Matthew.

Seems legit.

<TEXT> The marathon running turned out to be a total waste of time.  I was eating high carb, low fat.  It did nothing for me.  Prior to running, I was into bicycle racing.  I raced 2 years as a semi-pro.  My body fat was 8%.  I was riding 4-5 hours a day, 6 days a week.  I was burning a lot of calories and my food bill was over $200 a week.  I didn't know what I was doing and neither did anyone I was racing with.  The training was bad and diet was bad.  After bike racing, I started running.  I was not a good runner as I was a bike racer.  I couldn't sustain the bike racing.  It was a lot of work, and no money.  I took that as far as I could.  When I started the running, I was gaining weight from the standard American diet of low fat, high carb.  Every year, I gained weight and got bigger and bigger.  I have run 8 marathons, and countless 1/2 marathons and 10k.  Changing my diet was huge.  Over a year of low carb, high fat and doing intermittent fasting, I went from 30% body fat back down to 10-12% body fat.  It was amazing because I was not starving myself.  It was all diet.  I still run and do bike rides, but only once a week.  I do weight lifting.  I like weight lifting because I can do a 30 minute workout, 5 exercises, 5 by 5 and be done.  I get results and doesn't take any time.  Biggest bang for the buck.  Exercising to lose weight is a big waste of time.  It doesn't work.  Changing to a diet that lowers insulin, for many people, it works!  And if a person eats fat, they can lose weight and not be hungry.  Proof is in the pudding. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Calories are not equal.  A sugar calorie is not the same as a fat calorie.  Eating sugar will spike insulin which causes energy to be stored in fat cells.  Eating fat doesn't spike insulin so nothing is being stored as fat.  [Good Calories, Bad Calories: Fats, Carbs, and the Controversial Science of Diet and Health]
(https://www.amazon.com/Good-Calories-Bad-Controversial-Science/dp/1400033462/)

Further, eating carbs and sugar makes a person hungry 2-3 hours after eating.  Insulin clears the body of energy.  All the energy is gone in the blood, and insulin blocks the fat cells from releasing more energy.  A person has to eat again.  When I eat sausage, eggs, and butter for breakfast, I can easily go 6 hours without eating and not be hungry. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well we're living here in Allentown

And they're closing all the Christian bookstores down

Out in Bethlehem they're killing time

Filling out forms

Standing in line

Well our fathers fought the Second World War

Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore

Met our mothers in the USO

Asked them to dance

Danced with them slow

And we're living here in Allentown

- Billy Joel

<TEXT> FoxNews is in the "Business of Anger". There's an entire business...a huge industry, actually...that bases all that it does on getting you p!$$ed off! Rush Limbaugh. Bill O'Reilly. Glenn Beck. Alex Jones. All variations of the same thing: people in an industry who want you to believe their function is to "move the public dialogue forward" or to "make an opinion count on your behalf"...blah blah blah. But NO!

Their sole function is to make you angry. That's right. Get your dander up. Get you riled up and feeling as though you're right and all those other asses are wrong - and stupid! In turn, they hope that you'll pay more and more attention to them - while they reinforce your growing anger and disillusionment - and give them big ratings and more money from their advertisers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On the water fasts, a person is using their hormones at peak.  They are able to function well and the body is able to do its thing.  If a person is consuming some calories, the body will adapt to this and it will not be in total fat burning mode.  For myself, I found the water fasts to be easier because my body stopped craving food.  Juice has sugar in it and will spike insulin.  One of the things insulin does is block fat cells for releasing energy for 4 hours or so after consuming juice.  If a person ate something like fat with a little protein perhaps bone broth,  there would be no insulin spike.  Many people use bone broth on a fast. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I posted this before, there is research to back this up. They call it "Time Resisted Feeding". It is like IF, but they found that during the feeding window, even if a person eats LFHC, they get the same results. Basically, a person eats in a 12 hour window, they will maintain their weight. If they shorten the window to 8-10 hours, a person will lose weight and be lean. If a person is eating and lifting, they get muscle gains. Further, I think it is easier for a fat burner to do this because they will not be hungry. More details from the researchers in this [ video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R-eqJDQ2nU).

There is a neat little app available called "Zero" that a person can use to track their fasting time.  It is made by Kevin Rose of Digg fame. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A person can test insulin response in a lab environment.  Unfortunately, this is not available at home.  A blood glucose monitor is a close approximation.  They can test eating fat, eating protein, and eating carbs and sugar.  Carbs, and sugar spike insulin the most and then it takes the body 4 hours to get back to normal insulin level.  Insulin causes energy to be stored as fat, and it blocks fat cells from releasing energy.  Over time, a person just gets fatter and fatter.  Later, insulin resistance will develop then diabetes. For 90% of people, insulin is the key to losing weight, and reversing diabetes.  IF and fasting is the best method to get a person's insulin level to drop the most.  This literally resets a person's body back to normal. </TEXT>

Today, I am 10-12% body fat.  In that time, Jimmy has not gotten much smaller.  Don't know why.  All I can say is that it works very good for me.  On LFHC, I just got fatter and fatter every year (high insulin), and if I didn't change, today I would be diabetic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is research to back this up.  They call it "Time Resisted Feeding".  It is like IF, but they found that during the feeding window, even if a person eats LFHC, they get the same results.  Basically, a person eats in a 12 hour window, they will maintain their weight.  If they shorten the window to 8-10 hours, a person will lose weight and be lean.  If a person is eating and lifting, they get muscle gains.  Further, I think it is easier for a fat burner to do this because they will not be hungry.

It is against the US Constitution to do something like that.  In the state I live in, they can only hold people in jail for 2 days without any charges. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have seen pictures of a person who did a 30 day water fast.  The person's liver was noticeably smaller at the end of the fast.  However, once the person started to refeed, the size came back.  Apparently, stem cells get activated in the fast.  A switch gets turned on.  When a person refeeds, new cells are generated.  It this case, the person ended up with many new cells in his liver and other organs.  A 30 day water fast is very long.  Most people would not do a fast like that unless there is a medical reason to do so. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Insulin is what makes people fat.  There are other hormones to like cortisol, but for 90% of overweight people, hyperinsulinemia is the problem.  The book "Obesity Code" by Dr. Jason Fung goes into details about why people get fat.  If you read the ingredients on a jar of bulking powder, there is a lot of sugar and whey protein.  Whey protein is insulinemic and so is sugar.  This is measurable.  A person with a blood glucose monitor can see there blood sugar raise after eating this.  The rise in blood sugar will spike insulin.  If they have access to a lab, they can test their insulin level.  Now if a person wants to spend money to get fat, get fat, and then lose it again, knock yourself out.  I just stay lean.  It is easier and not much work.

Eating fat doesn't spike blood sugar.  Protein from meats spikes blood sugar some, but not as much as carbs, or sugar.  This is testable with a blood glucose monitor.  It is good to find out for yourself what exactly the body is doing instead of relying on an authority.  Authorities can sometimes be wrong. </TEXT>

"What turns off autophagy? Eating. Glucose, insulin (or decreased glucagon) and proteins all turn off this self-cleaning process. And it doesnt take much. Even a small amount of amino acid (leucine) could stop autophagy cold. So this process of autophagy is unique to fasting  something not found in simple caloric restriction or dieting." https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/fasting-and-autophagy-fasting-25/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> My goal is to get my % body fat to around 12%.  I am almost there.  I started keto 3 years ago and bf % was around 40%.  I weighted 253 and had about 90 lbs of fat on my body.  WTF!!  Today, I have about 20 lbs of body fat.  Cheers!!

The key for me is to stop listening to other people.  I experiment to find what works for me, and follow the results.  If something doesn't work, I stop doing it and change things up.  The key is to keep insulin low for a period of time.  It would be great if a person could measure insulin levels at home, but that is not possible right now.  Oh, well.  IF and fasting for 3-5 days works very good.  I would not be able to do that without being on keto.  The hunger would drive my brain crazy.

Carl Franklin and Richard Morris of the 2 Keto Dudes podcast are great to listen too.  These guys are down to earth and keep keto real. </TEXT>
