<TEXT> Cool OK. I don't think Alien is trying to surprise the audience with the death scenes, except perhaps for the airvent 'jump'. Weirdly, despite what may seem cliched, I still think it feels completely fresh and timeless each time I see it. I guess its just one of those things where people see it differently for all sorts of individual reasons.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> What do you think of Jonathan Glazer's Birth (2004)? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 12:38:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> On release, Birth was pretty slammed by critics and audiences, and seems to largely go ignored. Its not even available on bluray. It only has 38% on [RT](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/birth/), 6.1 on [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337876/). But in light of Sexy Beast and Under The Skin being so well thought of now, I wonder if people realize how overlooked and misunderstood Birth was?      

Personally, I think a lot of its criticism came from the discomfort of the story, implying reincarnation and Nicole Kidman getting into a bath with a boy thinking he's her late husband. But the story is so much more than that. At the time I think the ambiguities were met with impatience, because people didn't have a reason to trust Glazer's intentions (as with say, Tarkovsky, Lynch or Villeneuve). But if released now, I think it would be appreciated in a completely different way. Not that its even *that* ambiguous, the reveal actually dispenses completely with any supernatural allusions, and makes it far more about the complexities of human belief and how it can form so strongly by a mix of imagination and motive.  

Its also the closest film I know to deserving the circlejerky label of "Kubrickian". The direction is meticulous, the story told so cleanly and robustly with a strong sense of visual aesthetics and plenty of implied depth between the lines. A few really ballsy, jarring moments (Danny Huston spanking the boy, Kidman staring for minutes whilst thinking at the opera). There are also lots of little homages to Kubrick: the jogging tracking shot of the opening is like Bowman running around the ship in 2001, the silhoetted tunnel death is shot like the similar scene in A Clockwork Orange, the kid throwing a ball against the wall like Jack in The Shining, Kidman in the posh apartment feels like Eyes Wide Shut.  

Just wondered what y'all think of it. If you haven't seen, its absolutely worth watching, from a visual direction point of view alone its awesome.

<TEXT> Can I ask how you watched them? I always feel with detailed and opinionated reviews like this, its important to understand the context of the experience. I've seen Alien three times at the cinema, and every time it was absolutely incredible. Genuinely, with exception to a packed screening of Sicario, I've never known an audience to be part of such a tense, claustrophobic shared experience (and I'm guessing most of the audience, like me, had already seen it more than once). There's so much depth, atmosphere, and well-judged artistic choices, I'd go on all day in explaining it. But if you watch it on a laptop with high expectations, waiting for the "good bits" and not letting yourself sink into it (for example) then the experience will be much worse.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hope its story holds up better than Prometheus! I could never figure out why Shaw et al assumed the engineers made us, there's no real evidence of it (assuming she didn't watch the prologue). Can I ask another question about Compliance - Did Craig have you watch the Law and Order episode about the same case, with Robin Williams playing the caller?   

Compliance gets such a lot of flack from people saying "morons! they deserve it for being so stupid!" etc, which I always found massively unfair and distracting away from the core aspects of human nature that make people vulnerable to influence, especially when layered like that over time. I thought Craig did a *fantastic* job on researching and writing it so authentically. I really want to see Great World of Sound but can't find it anywhere in UK! </TEXT>

<TEXT>   You made some contradictory observations on the Z4 vs the Homido even before you purchased the Homido

That's simply not true, why are you saying that? I didn't comment on the Hv2 at all before purchase, I [asked questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleCardboard/comments/68uq8a/homido_v2_vs_bobovr_z4_vs_fiitvr_re_anything/dh1qejz/), stated I would get one, then that I had gotten one.    

You've basically played the standard disinformation cards of: "everything" I've written is wrong (or mind-boggling), its all lies because I haven't proven it, my opinion differs vastly those those with a proven purchase (i.e "everyone else likes it so therefore you're wrong"). If I seem defensive, its obviously because you're trying to disrepute my opinion (although you'll no doubt see it as *evidence of lying*).   

You said "everything" is mind-boggling. Can you disagree with *any* of these factors:  
- The Hv2 weighs 421gms, and if front heavy compared to the Bobo (weighing 430gms)  
- The focus wheel for the lenses takes a lot longer to adjust than the Bobo after changing IPD    
- The front panel clamp requires two hands to clasp and unclasp  
- The FOV isn't greater than the Bobo   
- The Hv2 is more than twice as expensive than the Bobo and doesn't have headphones   

No? Then it seems the only thing that's really mind-boggling, unless you want to stop generalising, is the issue regarding clarity. I have no idea why we disagree on that but we clearly do. My Hv2 lenses have *a lot* of edge distortion and light refraction/flaring which has nothing to do with QR codes.   

Here's your [proof](http://imgur.com/vhhQmTv).

<TEXT> Mind-boggling? Completely random? There's nothing random about it. What in particularly are you stumped about?     

Bobo more comfortable: Hv2 weighs 421gms, Bobo weighs 430gms *with* the headphones. Its simply far more comfortable, with the balanced weighting of the headphones. Hv2 feels far more front heavy. Not *too* heavy, I'm sure someone buying one as a first headset would be fine with it, but I'm specifically comparing it with the Bobo (which I do find more comfortable).   

Focus wheel: Yes, I prefer having a more immediate focus on the lens when adjusting IPD than having to turn the wheel a bunch of times. Its a minor point, in a comparison review something I thought worth mentioning.    

More detailed image on the Bobo: Yes, as mentioned the Bobo shows slightly more of the screen than the Hv2 (using an LGG4), hence more detail. That kind of thing matters when watching a cinema screen for example.  
Edit - I just tried the cinema app again to test this. The Bobo gives a *tinier* bit more screen, but overall is much clearer. The Hv2 has a definite distortion ring around the edge. I had a scene from Alien where it was dark on the left side and brighter on the right - the left edge of the lens cast a ghostly white flare against the dark, reflecting something from the right side. Its just annoying, and reduces the overall visible area. The Bobo lens doesn't have this issue at all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love Alien 3, almost on a par with Aliens. I think it has a really interesting story, in terms of Ripley being the outsider whilst the beast is repressed a little until they realise they need to team up to defeat it. I find it much more interesting in atmosphere, art design and direction than Resurrection. It has subtext and themes, and feels like a real story.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like the engineer stuff being implied under a veil of mystery, the more its spelled out the more 'human' and within the realms of a writer's imagination the whole thing becomes. When just implied, it feels beyond imagination, like its just something mankind isn't supposed to understand. I feel that a genuine other alien race like that would have communication/politics/beliefs/intelligence levels that are just *so* otherworldly that a coherent story could barely relate to it. For example, the scene with David pressing the blobby buttons and interpreting their starmaps, learning their language - its just way too human. Gone is the complete other-worldly mystery of the original set in Alien, and now we have this clinical set, blobby lighty-up buttons, perfect CGI orrerys - it just kills the imagination a little for me. Prometheus made me realise how much the atmosphere and other-worldly terror of Alien really relied on HR Giger's completely 'out there' designs. Without that, I'm sure it would have much more resembled a standard 70s alien sci-fi. In Covenant, I'd much prefer to see the aftermath of engineer activities and structures, to piece together intentions and agendas. I hate that they're called engineers though, when they're no more engineers than man (making spaceships and whatnot). The whole "they created us" thing just jars with me, when they apparently catalysed our evolution at best. They really don't seem to have much of a clue when it comes to engineering organisms, judging by the fact they more or less wiped themselves out in that pyramid, the last one thinking "fuck this" and putting himself in a cryopod. They could just as easily be called "clumsies" or "mess-abouters". It would be interesting to see different societies of engineers had been at war, so one took off to LV223 to create weapons, used Earth as a kind of easter island experiment zone, then maybe destroyed themselves so the other side won, but then the other side had to deal with the aftermath. Humans then pose a strange part of the equation in being an off-shoot of the weapon and therefore part of the enemy.         

The thing I like most about Prometheus is the psychological aspect of a person's belief system (or what they imagine about things without realising they're imagining it, like unconscious imagination) colliding with harsh reality. I'm really tired of seeing stupid characters in modern films though and hope that the writers realise by now that characters don't have to mimic modern audiences to be engaging and relatable.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> My comparison of Homido V2 against BoboVR Z4 (and Fiit) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-08 17:28:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently bought a Homido V2, already being a BoboVR owner, so thought I'd share my thoughts for anyone weighing all this up. Firstly, I had a **Fiit** before, and didn't like it. I know that Maria (can't find her username) [loves them](http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2016/03/review-lenest-viewer-is-close-to-perfect/) though. For me, the individually adjustable lenses are way too sensitive, meaning they go out of focus at the slightest touch (and your eyeballs/eyelashes often accidentally hit them if you have the lenses out too far). The asymmetric nature of their focusing means one eye might be better focused that the other, which causes headaches when your brain tries to marry the images. Ugh. Also, they have big ridges around the lenses which dig into your under-eyebrow if you position them so you can see through the center (rather than just under the center). Smaller FOV too, although the image is clear once focused. So I'm just going to exclude them now, as the BoboVR without headphones is better and about the same price (actually I think the BoboVR with headphones is a comparable price depending on where you are).   

I absolutely love the newer edition of the Bobo with the better solid magnet button, cleanable PVC/foam padding (*much* better than the old itchy foam stuff), and longer headphone jack (perfect for my LG G4 with jack on the bottom rather than top of phone, allows for adjustable volume via the Bobo knob rather than messing with the phone). I also like the headphones - I know some people prefer their own, but the convenience of just putting the headset on and having full immersion is perfect for me. All round a very comfortable, light, balanced headset with great optics. 

Also check out [u/i-poker's comparison here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleCardboard/comments/68uq8a/homido_v2_vs_bobovr_z4_vs_fiitvr_re_anything/). 

The **Homido V2**:   

*Phone lock mechanism* - I love the soft magnet closure of the Hv2, the clunky spring-clip of the Bobo often messes up your focus when force-closing it shut. But I found the actual phone clasp annoying on the Hv2. The Bobo has a nice soft ledge with adjustable edges, so you always know your phone is snug and centered the moment you place it in. The Hv2 has two claw-grips on the bottom and one on the top, all spring loaded. This means you have to use two hands to force them apart, before wedging the phone in. Two hands again to take the phone out. My LGG4 has a quickcircle soft case that bends around, and the strength of the claw is a bit concerning. I much prefer the gentle placing in on the Bobo. You also have to manually set the horizontal on the Hv2. U/i-poker's review has some extra useful points about screen size on this though.   

*View* - I prefer the Bobo. U/i-poker disagrees with me on this, so don't take my word for it, it might depend how you like your IPD (I like mine closer for a more 3D image at the sacrifice of a wider but more 2D FOV), or face/nose shape(?). Hv2 has a very, very similar size of view - I couldn't spot any significant difference at all. There are two disadvantages though. One is that there is a kind of fuzzy ring all the way around the lenses. Because each eye can see the fuzziness over the clarity of the other eye, it makes the view less comfortable in terms of stereopsis, because the brain has a harder time marrying up the images. (What I mean by this, is that near the clear center for one eye, will be slight fuzziness for the other eye, even with the IPD as close as it will go). I found the edge distortion much better on the Bobo. This was the biggest bugbear. After a while it gave me a headache. The second disadvantage is that the Hv2 magnifies ever-so-slightly more than the Bobo. This might be why there is more edge distortion. You basically don't see quite as much. On a cinema app, where I could just about see the whole screen on the Hv2, on the Bobo I could see more space to the sides of the screen too. Although its only slight, it means the image will be more detailed on the Bobo. Hope all that makes sense.    

*Comfort* - The Hv2 has very comfy padding, which blocks out light a little better than the Bobo. But because its SO padded, and pushed quite hard against the face, I found it misting up slightly more than I ever had on the Bobo. It also feels heavier. After using it a while, when putting on the Bobo, the Bobo feels almost weightless and less intense.     

*Other stuff* - Hv2 has a great focus mechanism for the lenses - its *very* precise and takes forever to turn the wheel to focus. I kind of prefer the faster mechanism on the Bobo though, if you switch your IPD for a different feel depending on the app, its nicer to instantly re-focus rather than spend ages turning the focus wheel. As I love the convenience of the headphones on the Bobo, it felt a distinct disadvantage having to use headphones on the Hv2. Obviously not a problem for anyone used to using their own headphones. I mostly use cinema apps, and like just putting the headset on and off when dealing with real-world stuff. Using separates just feels like more of a fuss. For the price, I massively prefer the BoboVR, which is 19.99 in UK compared to Homido's 49.99. I just can't see how it warrants the extra price *at all*. It feels like it should be about 15.99, like a more robust version of the Fiit. It does come with a lovely hard carry case though. It would be great to see a V3 of the Bobo with headphones that folded in, and a nice carry case. 

TL;DR, I much prefer the BoboVR Z4. u/i-poker has a different perception on this though, so do check out [his comparison](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleCardboard/comments/68uq8a/homido_v2_vs_bobovr_z4_vs_fiitvr_re_anything/) too.  

Edit - i-poker [found this](https://www.vr-iphone.com/2017/02/homido-v2-mobile-vr-review/) suggesting some fixes have been made to a variant of the V2. Although a "slight increase in FOV", I doubt it fixes the other problems I have with the headset, or the refracting light on the very edge of the lens. I'm not at all motivated to buy another one to find out.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a neat tip, thanks! I love this headset, especially the newer edition with the PVC/foam padding and longer headphone jack. Am so pleased they did that, it lets me retain the volume control using my LGG4.  

The only remaining niggle I have with the Bobo is the clasp mechanism of the front. I wish they'd made a nice magnetic one like the Homido V2, rather than one you really have to shove to click shut. The pressure of closing it messes up the focusing, as it pushes that whole front bit in. It means you have to refocus it every time you change to a different app. Not so much an issue when you're used to it, but a pain when showing friends.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Homido V2 arrived today - just had a quick blast so will share my thoughts. I used the "cinema walk" app (where you can walk around a cinema, I had Aliens playing). It took a while to get it adjusted nicely. I like how massively precise the focusing is - you have to spin the wheel ALOT to really change the focus.  

I really don't notice a lot of difference to the BoboVR though! On my Bobo, I like the IPD set as minimal as possible so the images overlap more (more 3D, less FOV, but more immersive for me). What I notice on the Homido is that when I close each eye, there is more distortion on the inner edges of the eye, as well as less screen showing. Here's what I mean: so I'm standing in the middle of the cinema watching Aliens. On the HV2, If I close my left eye, the left edge of the right eye is a little distorted (brighter, stretched) and is just touching the left side of the cinema screen. Vice versa for left eye. On the Bobo, the edge distortion isn't as bad, and there is more of a gap between the edge of the FOV out of one eye and the cinema screen. So on the H2, each eye is seeing this brighter slightly stretched distortion running down the edges near the screen, but its nowhere near as bad on the Bobo. I can't see any difference with regards to that middle bit you were talking about, I have no idea why, maybe its a specific face shape thing? I also noticed that the Bobo is MUCH nicer balanced on the head, and feels so much lighter, almost weightless (I appreciate the headphones help balance the weight) whilst the H2 is much bulkier and front-loaded. Ehh. Its tough weighing them up. At this point I can't see any noticeable benefit of the H2 at all, but will test it loads more on different apps and see if it grows on me. What QR code did you use for it? I notice one doesn't come with it.      </TEXT>

<TEXT> I rewatched The Fugitive recently and *really* enjoyed it. Its one of those rare occasions where an exciting, Saturday Movie style premise actually has good performances, writing and structure. Two things I love about it: how Tommy Lee's team all have their own characters and nuances, without being self-consciously showy like so many of today's films; how great the balance is between Kimble being truly lost in this urban jungle (helped by the interspersed aerial shots) but also constantly under pressure to not be discovered whilst solving the crime. The soundtrack is great too. I agree the ending could have had more 'oomph' in terms of the motives and redemption, but it was more a macguffin by that point to drive forward the cat/mouse relationship between Kimble and Tommy Lee (a bit like the story structure of North by Northwest).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its worth watching in terms of understanding where Ridley's mind is at with regards to events leading up to LV426. You need the back story for sure to appreciate Covenant.   

Cinematically it looks nice, and is very well designed, but never quite has that 'epic' space feel. Story-wise its a trainwreck. Listening to the commentary between the two feuding writers (one was brought in to redraft the other) there are LOTS of decisions made before, during and after shooting (i.e. editing) that change things and explain the incoherence in many areas.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some excellent thoughts there, I agree on all points. Interesting about the Hindu chariot, I didn't realise that at all. It being Christmas is another shoe-horned reference.  

Some other thoughts I had: Was it really logical for Shaw (or Weyland, anyone) to assume that whoever the visitors were in the cave paintings, had created us? I can't figure out this leap. It would surely just imply that creatures had visited, but there's no evidence that they had anything to do with our creation. Even if Shaw was going down that road, it would probably be more logical to think that we *were* the aliens who had visited. So they didn't create us anymore than primitive apes 'created' us.  

Along those lines, I think it would have been far more interesting as a film without the prologue. If it opened at the hole that Shaw makes in the cave (also, how the *hell* did she know about that cave before breaking in, maybe I missed something there) then we could have followed the mystery with all of them, not knowing. The first sight of the engineers would be the ghost recordings and head, which would have been far more exciting than having known about them beforehand. Sharing that surprise with the crew (i.e. not having been primed by the prologue) would have also shown how inappropriate their response was. Really they should be thinking "holy shit, what is this? An alien? Or did the aliens kidnap a human and this is what they evolved into?" There's still absolutely no evidence whatsoever that the engineers 'created' us, so when Holloway has that hissy fit in the deleted scene, it really makes no sense. The film seems to behave as though Shaw/Holloway had watched the prologue. Unless I'm missing something here?   

Also, when Shaw says "oh, stab it behind the ear, that should reactivate its neural centers" (or something to that effect, I have *no clue* how she suddenly become an expert pathologist of engineers.  

Really though, the real film is David's story, and I feel like the film completely belongs to him. His lines are a whole level beyond everyone elses, the balance of sardonic wit and sarcasm hinting at darker agendas is such good fun. I'm still not sure what his agenda was in knowing about the goo, infecting Holloway's drink, enjoying the alien foetus in Shaw and hoping to return it to earth.  

One other thought - how on earth would taking all the goo canisters to earth destroy us? Surely it would just turn us into billions of weird-as-fuck tentacled creatures which wouldn't help anyone.

<TEXT> I love the soundtrack to Alien. The opening credits are amazing in their set up of what follows. You have this eerie, hollow, lonely and isolated vacuum of space sound, the ominous wind (that you can hear on LV426 and often on the ship). Then this little soft, slow melody starts, like someone thinking, dreaming or hoping. Then it cuts off with the little percussive rattle, like the cruel alien world snuffing it out. The music at the start of Aliens does a similar thing in a different way. Its so atmospheric and awesome, I fuckin' love it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Followed by "hehe, why don't you pay me on the other side?" LOLZ WE'RE ABOUT TO DIE! So terrible. Also, when Vickers says "ok... FATHER!" Or Shaw, having watched her boyfriend burn to death, had an alien foetus cut out of her, been attacked by a super-humanoid, watched it get killed by her now-massive 'baby', somehow crawls her way back to the crashed ship again (having already abseiled out of its vagina-door with a severed abdomen) first thing she asks David - "where's my cross?" "Oh yeah, its in my utility belt. Everything cool? Remember to pick up some milk? Still going to pilates tonight?"   

Also, the whole section left out where Weyland is dreaming whilst in cryo, of being on a weird futuristic boat (which they designed and built). As far as I can see, this was one of the main reasons to have Guy play Weyland, so he could play his younger self in the dreams. Without that, I always find his performance (and casting) as Weyland really distracting, because he really looks like a young guy plastered in makeup the whole time. The dream scenes could have been edited into a really eerie Twilight Zone/Black Mirror vibe if we (and him also) then suddenly realised they were just dreams, and he's actually super old and in the middle of space somewhere.   

The thing with Prometheus that bugs me the most is that it doesn't ever really feel like a real film. Despite the design work, it just lacks something. The acting, characters, dialogue, story and look of the whole thing all reek of TV. Its like HBO made a big-budget Alien spin-off TV season, using some cheap actors and a couple of big names (sorta like Westworld). There were loads of subplots and bits of philosophizing weaving in a few core themes etc (again like Westworld). Then, some fan edits together a 2 hour movie based on the 13 hour season. But it just feels a little choppy, and there clearly can't be a central core story or anything remotely cinematic in terms of atmosphere. All the allusions to creating, paternity, religion etc end up just feel ham-fisted and shoe-horned in out of context, missing the bits where they're fleshed out more across episodes.   

I hope to hell that Ridley returned to his cinematic senses a bit for Covenant.

<TEXT> Also, did the engineers have any idea what humans were? They just dropped off that guy to spill his gloopy dna into the water, which later evolved into humans, but they have no idea (as far as I can tell) how that panned out. They could have thought earth was riddled with xenomorphs for all they know. So that would have to be one hell of a detection system to place the nearby ships origin within the galaxy </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just watched Prometheus 3D again after the docu, and it makes it far more of a frustrating watch. I can now appreciate all the work and design that went into *every single* visual element - building a buggy from scratch, the suits, all the amazing sets. But then the Scottish woman saying "yep shes totally doped up", Fifield getting high in his space suit, the other guy saying "come here little fella!" to a vicious looking alien, Shaw not grieving after Holloways death or twlling anyone about her crazy casarian, the captain immediately agreeing to Shaws flimsy rationale to crashing into the alien ship and his co-pilots immediate support, the terrible acting from that guy going on about his repetitive betting gag, Shaws recording saying "still searching..." before the ship zooms off like an 80s kids film - those moments (and more) are SO jarring! Its the strangest imbalance of thought/attention to detail Ive ever seen in a film.   

A great making-of though, and glad you watched it! </TEXT>

Did you miss the Prometheus prequel? After that we'd have *no* idea what the creature/s in Covenant would look like, so it would have been a much better choice to make it a surprise. Marketing teams of course dont give a shit about artistic integrity, surprise or the actual experience, they want to spoil everything as selling points to make more box office. A true fan would have had a much better experience not watching any Covenant trailers.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I always imagined a scenario where the spacejockey was somehow a carrier to a chestburster, which burst during flight and led to the crashing of the ship. Then, the chestburster grew into a queen (maybe eating the crew), then made a nest of the ship, laying a whole bunch of eggs. I figured the light-layer barrier thing was some kind of organic node she'd have put there as a way to wake up the eggs only when something intruded (a cool idea which was subsequently dropped, eggs then just somehow 'knew' when someone was near).  

But Prometheus and Ridley's suggestions change all that to suggest that the ship was *carrying* the eggs as a biological weapon. This doesn't make sense to me, because if the ship crashed after a chestburster, the eggs would have flown about all over the place and caused a right mess. They also wouldn't be lying flat in the way that they were. It seemed so much more appropriate and eerie that the chestburster eventually made a nest of the crashed ship, waiting to be discovered.  

Also, I always felt the beauty of Alien's story was that it was *completely alien*, mankind suddenly being framed as this utterly insignificant, helpless and vulnerable thing in the context of nature's cruellest, darkest corner of the galaxy. To suggest that the alien's actually share DNA with humans, might have been intended to destroy us all along, and along with the 'engineers' are actually *ancestors* of mankind just kind of pisses all over the idea of actually being 'alien'.   

What do you think?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly. I watch it about once a year *really* wanting to like it, hoping it will just click somehow. But it just can't. Its a horrible mix of gorgeous (but also incredibly 'designed' and clinical looking) visuals, hinting at what could have been, with first-draft level writing and annoyingly self-conscious 2-dimensional characters. But even beyond that is the really annoying story. I appreciate Ridley trying to tackle the spacejockey, but it felt so much better leaving all that to the imagination in Alien. No matter how hard I try to forgive it, the whole "they invited us", "I choose to believe", "oh no, actually they want to destroy us" with all the instant-evolving bullshit along the way is just absolutely *stupid*. I just can't get over the fact that Ridley will have his artists develop, design and produce a perfect looking and perfect working science buggy, with every last detail designed from scratch, yet not give anywhere near the same level of thought to the story.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> So Damon Lindelof gets brought on-board at a late stage to take all of Jon Spaihts ideas and 'drive them home' as an existing screenwriter (despite being only from TV where stories are necessarily patchy and cross-cutting, rather than developing a singular core idea).   

Lindelof then criticizes Alien as being thematically poor, saying 'it is what it is' as if just some mundane space slasher that happens to have good design. Then it turns out that Ridley had a few random scenes he wanted in the film, that Spaihts had worked to include by zig-zagging all over the place to force them in. Its really no wonder that Prometheus ended up being very pretty (incredible attention to design and visual ideas) but mostly a collection of sporadic story ideas that were strung together based on what Ridley thought looked cool. Its almost satirical that Spaihts designed a kind of board-game to map out the plot points.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah he was a real dick. I specificially remember him bashing Lynch's dialogue style in certain scenes, re-enacting bits like "a tape", "a tape?" "yes, a tape" as though it was terrible. No appreciation for the intent behind decisions like that (like those bits in Blue Velvet where is sort of celebrates the banality and simplicity of peripheral characters, but in a way where it feels unsettling against the weirdness in how it isolates it). Our teacher was a total cunt though, he bashed all our art work, was completely discouraging, after discussing a filmmaker would say something like "none of you will reach that level though". Of course he flirted with the pretty girls and always told them their work was great. He was fat and stunk of cigarettes all the time too. People like that really shouldnt be allowed anywhere near an impressionable, optimistic mind.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for this. I found the Fiit FOV nowhere near as good as the Z4 - even though the eyes are close to the lens (too close, I'd often have to clean residue off the lens from where my eyeball actually touched it sometimes) on the Fiit, it looked like a toilet roll compared to the Z4 which is wider. Z4 cheats a bit though as the IPD can be set to have a smaller 3D overlap, so it looks more like the shape of binoculars you see in those older movies (like a venn diagram). Is the view through the Homido V2 circular or more Venn-ish? This is where its all at for me - how it would feel to watch a film in a VR cinema. Its hard weighing up whether the 50 would be worth it. Thanks for your info!

<TITLE> What's your preferred cinema app? I'll compare Cmoar and VU cinema here </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-02 20:08:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After dossing about with the *very few* decent cardboard games (Gravity Pull, Wrong Level/Voyage etc) I mostly like to watch films all tucked into my bobovr/LGG4 (with the perforated non-foam padding, I had the foam version and it felt horrible and I broke out in pimples, ugh. The longer bendier headphone jack is much better than using an extension on the LG as well, because it keeps the volume functionality). I use two apps, but both have pros and cons so thought I'd mention them.   

**Cmoar cinema**: pros - excellent cinema atmosphere, really feels authentic with excellent seat graphics and screen surround. Absolutely feels like a late night at the cinema. Ability to switch off the environment too so its just the screen. Settings allow you to change the FOV which has the equivalent effect of placing you further or closer to the screen which is really useful depending on the film. Yes you can notice some pixelation but generally its fine. Ability to lock the screen to prevent drift. Also can press magnet button to center again if drifting. I like using a big cinema screen though so prefer looking around. Cons - 3D films really don't seem very 3D. Battery intensive, phone gets quite hot. You're looking "up" at the screen slightly, its not tiered seats. Costs $/4.99, but I think its worth it. Also has youtube and lan support but I never bother with that.  

**VU cinema**: pros - has a choice of cinema, home or IMAX. IMAX is really cool - a bigger, curved screen and 3 choices of where you sit, front middle or back (same functionality as the FOV choice on cmoar). Tiered seats so the screen is more level. 3D seems slightly better, but I might be imagining this. Ability to switch off environment also so you can just see the screen. Also has screen lock. Costs $/1.99 which is worth it. Also plays youtube, I think with voice recognition for searching according to blurb. Cons - without switching off environment, seats etc look too bright, so not as cool an atmosphere as cmoar. Doesn't allow for 2.35:1 ratio, fattens it to 1.85:1 which is really annoying.   

Overall I prefer cmoar, but like the IMAX option on VU for films that are in 1.85:1 ratio. If you use something else that you prefer, I'd love to hear about it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Is what action is going on that corresponds our "wants" to our actual body movements?   

I read a paper on this not so long ago. There is an area of the brain linked to motor coordination that sends a 'copy' of its actions to another area of the brain (I think the executive function) where somehow its translated into a sense of conscious will. Its linked to corollary discharge and efference copy. This is why its hard to tickle yourself, because the sense of conscious will interferes with the 'unfamiliar' feeling. When these pathways get damaged, and the person doesn't experience the accompanying sense of will, they'll experience themselves as moving and behaving automatically like automatons instead. Hypnosis can also drive a wedge between the two, so the person experiences their normal subconsciously fuelled actions as 'happenings' rather than 'doings'. Thanks so much for your post! I think there's going to be a real revolution in self-awareness once neuroscience catches up with the general concepts that people hold about themselves.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  If your subconscious did everything, then you wouldn't be aware.   

Why can't awareness just be another emergent property of subconscious functioning? If, for example, the relevant areas of the brain are damaged, the person loses a sense of conscious volition and experiences themselves as an automaton.  

 Also, *you* are the one who programming your subconscious, thus making you the one who has control.   

What makes you so sure? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for giving such a thoughtful reply, you're the only one to spot the inherent implication regarding consciousness itself. Yes, Maeve is a great analogy, as are many moments and implications of that show!  

People do seem *very* attached to their feelings of consciousness, free will and conscious volition, to the extent that questioning them often gets met with anxious confusion and hostility. But what if the attachment causes an unnecessary level of separateness, competition, comparison, judgement, even pride and self-aggrindising? Without it we might all be a lot more patient, understanding, and appreciate the true, wider context of causality more. Also, I think on a big enough scale, time itself starts to lose meaning. Not sure if you've seen Arrival, but at its heart is an exploration of these ideas.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the problem though I guess. Even when waking, I have a feeling (a philosophical one, not phenomenological) that my sense of lucidity is a brain-created sensation. Its not like I can really 'cause' anything other than what my brain (encapsulating my unconscious mind) would have ordinarily and automatically caused. If I choose a number, and choose 8, there's no way I could have chosen 5, because everything in my brain at that point led me to choose 8. So when I have varied feelings of control in a dream, I assume that they are a factor of the dream. If consciousness is aroused to the extent that I assume full control, then it ceases to be a dream, and is more a case of a vivid imagination.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for a reasonable and interesting answer. What you describe in your first paragraph sounds like something in between dreaming and waking life to me - like using the (imagination/dreaming) technology of the brain to conjure representations in real time as you will them to happen. Using similar processes involved in hypnotic hallucinations perhaps. But I think that's different from having a dream where your awareness increases to the extent that you realise you're dreaming, then have a sense of exerting some varied control over that dream? Perhaps its just a question of definitions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, OK. So you say "Why the parts of the brain associated with rational thinking, awareness and decision making we use while awake become active?" I say "Why do you think they do?" then you say "OMG! Its not ME that thinks they become active!" I really don't think you're following logic here, at all. I simply reversed your question to find its implication, and you distort its meaning entirely from when you first asked it. I'm not asking why you have the opinion that they become active, I'm asking for what reason do you think they become active. We just don't seem to be understanding each other at all, which I would think is a requisite for this kind of discussion unfortunately.

<TEXT>  Why the parts of the brain associated with rational thinking, awareness and decision making we use while awake become active?  

Why do *you* think they do? Do you honestly think you "will" them into activation?   

If I told you I dreamed of running through a meadow, you could just ask "why the parts of the brain associated with running, and meadows become active?"  Its just that when the areas associated with rational thinking, awareness and decision making *do* activate, you experience the sense of a lucid dream. 

 Lucid dreaming has been scientifically proven a different state of consciousness.  
 
A different state to what, normal consciousness or dreaming? I've no doubt that there are "scientifically proven" different states whilst dreaming, it would make sense if the activation of your conscious areas are varied. Being a different state doesn't mean that you *aren't* dreaming of being conscious.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not making a distinction between 'awareness' and 'the idea of awareness' - the sensation would be the same. Are you assuming that awareness itself isn't created by a part of the brain? Whatever part of the brain it is, that's what I'm suggesting is active when you feel more aware in a dream.  

I don't see how saying "I have inner dialogues in my regular dreams" is different from saying "I dream of having inner dialogues". Whether you consider the decisions of 'dream you' your calls or not would be dependent on whether those events are accompanied by a dreamed sense of conscious will. One is just experienced as a 'happening' and the other as a 'doing'.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  if there are discreet differences between those and normal sleep patterns   

I'm not sure what this would prove though. There could easily be discrete differences in sleep patterns between other sensations - e.g. a sexual dream, dreaming of sitting in a library, and a nightmare for example. As neither could be lucid, any other discrete differences wouldn't imply consciousness?  

If the areas were active but not sensed, that could just mean that other accompanying areas aren't active to give the full sensation. Which is why sometimes you're slightly conscious and feel aware but can't 'control' anything, other times you feel like you're more in control, and other times you feel fully in control but still within the confines of the rules of the dream. 

In a way brain areas eventually just becomes a circular definition however complex you take it, unless you think that sensation could exist outside of its accompanying brain area.  </TEXT>

But what if you just dreamed about it being way more specific, and had a heightened feeling of being in control? and in the other lucid dreams, you just didn't have as much of a sensation of being in control? Last night, you just dreamed that you wanted to do the things that you were doing. Basically whatever you are capable of sensing in waking reality (consciousness, control, desire) you are just as capable of sensing if those same areas happened to be active in a dream? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The example I gave of reading about lucid dreams obviously wasn't to suggest that you *have to* read about them to trigger them.   

The part of the brain creating the sensation of awareness obviously *would* be active in a dream involving a sensation of awareness. In the same way that the part of the brain creating a sense of fear would be active in a dream involving a sensation of fear. Basically any brain area responsible for any sensation is going to be active to create that sensation in a dream. What does that matter? It doesn't mean that you're *not* dreaming of a sensation of awareness.  

The feeling is different to a normal dream, because the very area that controls your feeling of being aware is active, whilst it isn't in most of your other dreams. It might feel like you're choosing things in your dreams, and controlling it, but your dream is still *completely automatic*, it just has an accompanying sense of "conscious will" attached to it because that part of the brain happens to be active in the dream.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> More and more these days I think that a lucid dream is simply a dream where your sense of "self" or "conscious will" is activated as part of the dream, in the same way that any other part of your brain might be activated. So whilst it feels like you're suddenly aware and controlling it, it really is just a feeling, a sensation that is an artifact of the brain's random activation.   

When reading about lucid dreams, its common to then experience one. This isn't because you've somehow become more aware or have trained yourself - its just because you've been thinking about conscious awareness, so that part of the brain is more likely to fire up when processing memories during sleep.

No, you're really not, its been mentioned over and over again. 

 Actually I don't even remember the names of the characters.

Regarding cultural impact, although obviously everyone knows of Avatar and its place in cinematic history, I know what you mean. If you take any other top 10 box office film, you'll be able to come up with character names, ideas, scenes, classic iconography or something. With Avatar, nothing has really become classic. Compare it with say, Aliens, where almost every character, line and set-piece is celebrated. With Avatar, I get the sense that Cameron wanted "I see you" to become a known catchphrase of the film, or the action scenes to become classics, but no one gives a shit. It all just feels oddly flat and unmemorable. I've discussed this before and heard that its part of the strategy to appeal to mass international markets, bland apparently helps rather than having spikier moments or ideas, but I'm not so sure about that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Please don't read on if you haven't seen the film!  

I recently saw the brilliant film Stalker and am still 'feeling' it. I wanted to just share my own interpretation on the last scene to see what others think who are no doubt more clued up on this film than I currently am. The scene shows the Stalkers child (called Monkey) seemingly moving glasses on a table top. 

I feel that on the surface its supposed to look like telekinesis, and that the child has adopted the Stalker's unwitting skill as implied at the start of the film also. But actually its a really clever symbol of the Stalkers dilemma, and puts us in his place. Initially, we want to believe in something, have faith in something outside of ourselves, in the same way that he wanted to believe that he has a sense of greater purpose, and can find some kind of soulful/spiritual connection with the people he guides to the zone. But ultimately, he's devastated and disillusioned because these people, who he looks up to and envies, are ultimately just as flawed, insecure and racked with self-doubt as he is. In the same way, the film is inviting us to want to believe the child has telekinesis. But there's the sound of the passing train, and the glasses all move in the same direction, thereby likely caused by vibrations. It can't be a coincidence that the same sound of a moving train can be heard at one point as they're approaching the Zone. So as the child watches the glasses, perhaps convinced he or she (I couldn't tell) is moving them (being causal) they're actually just observing, because causality is out of their hands. The glasses are consequential just like everything else. This is also what the idea of the Zone threatened to reveal, which the writer and professor became increasingly aware of (as well as the Stalkers wife), that ultimately happiness relies on illusions rather than absolute truth.  

I just wondered what others made of this scene. Perhaps its supposed to be completely ambiguous so that viewers see what they want to see. This is my first Tarkovsky film so am looking forward to seeing the others.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a really interesting shot in LH in the first half where you see a cloud of red mist/fog emerging above a staircase. In any other film it would seem strange, but in LH it just fits, and implies this idea of something unknown and frightening gradually emerging. That kind of seed, well sewn, can be so powerful on your unconscious imagination in terms of triggering things that relate to you personally. Then the ideas of distrust, some external threat, implied in such an unnerving way that again the imagination starts to process those ideas in the background. Lynch is a master at creating that kind of weird unconscious anxiety, where your own imagination starts processing and associating in ways that continue behind what you're actually seeing. So by the time of the party scene, you're feeling just as unsettled as Fred is. 
I saw Lost Highway at the cinema on release with a class of fellow lens media students, and I was the only one who loved it. Everyone else hated it, including our teacher who unfairly criticised the hell out of it afterwards (which really infuriated me). Its still one of my favourite films, and soundtracks, of all time. </TEXT>

I would perhaps recommend the shining, as there's plenty of visual motifs, symbols and compositions worth writing about, as well as a lot of existing analysis and theories. There's a website somewhere (you'll have to find it yourself!) where a guy breaks down almost every aspect of the film, with all sorts of theories about the length of specific shots by the frame, the use of numbers (especially 42 and 21), pop-culture references, mirror-structured editing and all kinds of symbology. If you delve into that, hopefully you'll have your own ideas emerge about what interests you most or what would be good to right about.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Directors Cut of Abyss is a strange situation as far as DC's go, in terms of how it changes the whole point of the story. The theatrical cut is about this kind of justifiably cautious xenophobia against an unknown lifeform, but then they turn out to be helpful (hooray!) This is weird story to tell though because the lifeforms *could have* just as easily eaten the fuck out of the crew or drowned them with controlled water if they were that way inclined. But then of course the DC changes the point entirely to being about man's use of violence. I find the DC weird though in that the aliens threaten to create a fucking tidal wave, then change their minds because of *one* man telling his wife he loves her.  It makes the aliens are more gung-ho and unnecessarily violent in terms of how they were planning to react. Plus their perspective seems really imbalanced if they just record all our news about war and nukes etc, but not the nicer stuff.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just finished it (did you see it on Film4 also?) It was long for sure, but once I was settled in there was plenty to ponder on. I found it truly unsettling with the stuff about self-perception, self-worth, achievement, wanting to connect to people, I didn't expect it to delve into the human condition quite as much as it did. I'm definitely glad I saw it, and will hit Solaris next. I notice The Mirror is on Film4 in a few days too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its just pointless. I could say anything reminds me of anything, and a certain mindset gunning for a fight would delight in trying to shred my thought to pieces. Its not coming from a frame of trying understand, at all, why something might have a certain opinion, its coming from a frame of right/wrong, agree/hate, which is not the kind of debate I want with something as innocuous as this, its just completely pointless. To judge my reluctance as snooty, having already written the things you have, seems hypocritical to me, and shows that you really are just gunning for a fight. I do hope you get to go down your well trodden 'road' of arguing Kurosawa/Silence with someone else soon, and that it provides you with the outlet you are looking for. Have a good day </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely! Make sure you get in. There are two ways around this. 1) Get someone else to get your ticket for you, in advance, via a credit card (say at Odeon). Pop along, pick up your ticket from the machine. Getting through the ticket-tearing guy is easier than the box office, because s/he'll have loads of people tickets to tear and won't care. 2) Get a ticket for another movie, like Guardians of the Galaxy or some shit, thats showing at a similar time. Then just go into the "wrong screen" and not realise until the film starts, then be too embarrassed to leave. OR go on a saturday, see a film that starts before Covenent, then sneak into it afterwards. Make sure you see it though, as an Alien fan you owe it to yourself.   </TEXT>

That's not a luxury the vast majority of young actors have, so why should Emma Watson be any different? She's had many chances to prove herself if she had any talent at all, but she clearly doesn't, hence the general disdain for her shitty acting skills and annoying presence in films.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> He does indeed. There are some really hilarious segments written by witnesses of encounters with Uri, like meetings in hotel lobbys etc, where they describe what he did and how he responds to various things. One time, he is trying to bend a key on his chair when the other people step away, and shuffling his chair forward (as the excuse for grabbing the seat with the key in hand) he has to widen his knees due to a close coffee table and rips his pants! But then just makes a joke of it and carries on milking the slightly bent key. The way he gauges his response to successes and failures to always be in his favour is cringe-worthy at times, but audiences lap it up. Its like he sat down one day and thought "wow, people are schmucks, I bet I could con the hell out of them in the most ridiculous ways and they would never see it. All I need is good lawyers to control the skeptics" (i.e. the same idea as Tony Robbins, Richard Bandler, Peter Popoff and many others)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been reading this the past few days and think its terrific. Although not his intention, it really delves into the subtlety and nuance of the presentation of magic in terms of "showing the process" (reminding me of Derren Browns' Pure Effect), the psychology and manipulation of belief and how it dovetails with desire and imagination. All the while riffing on irrationality, the human condition and some classic methods. Also of course, what a bonkers sociopath Geller is.  

Just thought I'd highly recommend it for anyone who likes that kinda thing.  </TEXT>

Its known that PR junkets can be very manipulative towards positive reviews (implicit bribes via gifts and treats), but I'm sure it happens within marketing teams as well (i.e. its someone's job to boost marketing via "positive PR" which the person helps fulfill via a bunch of fake IMDB accounts).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think Michael Mann's Miami Vice film will develop more cult status in time, and be thought of alongside Thief, Heat and Manhunter as among his best. It has a very unique and thought-out style and depth, its world being so trodden in and tired that exposition is thin on the ground and most of the substance is implied. I've really come to appreciate it much more on rewatches.  </TEXT>

I fear a lot of people watch it for the first time on a laptop or tablet, whilst whatsapping people and checking facebook, then think "meh" which is all they deserve. On a big, sharp screen with surround sound, it really is an experience. When I bought a decent VR headset and virtual cinema app, Bladerunner was the first thing I watched in it.    

Story and structure wise it is pretty simple, but there are plenty of details and deep ideas that are there to be discovered.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I generally enjoyed it, and admired its ambitions, but it had one major flaw. It didn't rise above its influences. Say for example an Edgar Wright film, even though you know its packed full of homages, the core of the film is oomphy and interesting enough to be a film in its own right. The homages are an after thought. Same with something like Kill Bill, or Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13.   

But The Void will *only* be talked about in terms of its homages, it doesn't have the oomph or confidence in itself to rise above those comparisons and feel like a worthy project or story in its own right.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some good points. Generally, in my experience, people seem to use that particular coping mechanism of diminishing personal accountability with something like "it was meant to be" when they (consciously or unconsciously) know that they were somehow responsible OR a freak event that is *positive* (where it feels nice to think it was destined). E.g. Anna gets rejected by her partner, because she lies all the time. Rather than take accountability for that (something which is perceived by her mind as painful), she says "oh well, it wasn't meant to be" and moves on, forever stubborn in her self-denial. Or, Anna picks the winning lottery numbers just as she's planning to save up for a new car, and says "it was meant to be". But if in a gusty gale, a slate slides off of Anna's roof and decapitates her cat, she probably won't say "it was meant to be", neither would her neighbors when consoling her. But yes I agree. 

As a complete aside but related to your comment on religion/Buddhism/dumb animals on a rock, recently I've been trying to live in the frame that free/conscious will is an illusion, that everything is a happening and some things just feel like doings, and it really does cause some massive shifts in perspective on things.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure, I appreciate its a coping mechanism. But it can also be unhealthy to imply *meaning*, as it encourages an external locus of control and diminishes personal accountability (even if there is none, the sense of personal accountability generally can be diminished by any belief system that promotes some sort of cosmic "meaning"). Something like "its just one of those things..." seems far more appropriate.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> WHOOAAA what the fuck? Flight of the Navigator is *still* a great movie. HOW FUCKING DARE YOU.   

Seriously though, the atmospheres in the film are so unique and cool, especially the whole section from walking his dog on that spooky walk, calling on his (now older) parents and then escaping in the ship. Once he's in the ship, things get a little cornier, but that section is only the last third of the film, and it gets cool again once they try to go back in time. I still think its a really interesting film. I think about what happens at the end - imagine if within a couple of years his parents got divorced or one died for whatever reason, David would know that in the parallel world where he went missing for 8 years, they stayed together and survived, so it would really fuck his head up knowing that his presence has a weird butterfly effect for the worse. DARYL is also still an awesome film, they're both just kind of exciting and fun.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I enjoyed it on first watch, and its admirable for bringing Desmond's story to the screen. But I don't think it does it with a true sense of integrity or cinematic depth. In hindsight it feels very Hollywood, emotionally manipulative, overly-polished and kind of bland because of that. I have no desire to rewatch it at all, there's nothing between the lines.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love how the film is like a magic trick, with Caine directly referencing the audience. In a way, both Prestige and Inception are like meta-explorations of cinema as illusion (I realise how pretentious that sounds). Also, Im blown away by how quickly The Prestige was made, between the first two Batman films. Its one of the few films I feel is an improvement on the book, with substantial changes for the better. Its such an exquisite, meticulous film that feels like it should have taken years to make. Amazing it was released in such a low key way as well (although Ive been lucky to see all of Nolans films at the cinema since Memento).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> IPD is misunderstood. Usually it means inter pupillary distance but of course here its inter LENS distance. If you have lenses directly in front of your eyes, your eyes will stare directly forwards, see the images, and the brain will merge them. If the lenses (bobo lenses, not eye lenses) are slightly closer, then the eye gaze will gave to converge slightly, before the brain merges the images. These two scenarios have different results on the sense of distance that is perceived. You need to focus the lenses differently.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Such a weird coincidence. Yesterday (when you posted) I mentioned to mum (who has a bike set up in front of a tv) that she could probably get a VR app to cycle to.   

But, here's why I don't think it would work. With a straight road, you mention that people would want to just look around. Would they? I think the last thing people would want to do is wear a big thing strapped to their heads, fogging up, head itching from micro-perspiration in the hair with the straps, just so they can look around at polygon trees which would get boring fast. Then there's the issue of battery drain, whatsapp/text/calls interfering the flow. It just seems like finding a problem for a solution rather than the other way round. I really can't see how it would be better to deal with all that over watching something on TV.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One thing I've noticed on my bobo is that a completely different feel can be found according to whether you have the IPD set narrow or wide. Both variables can be adjusted for focus. A wider IPD gives a wider FOV, but the two fields of vision have a smaller 3D overlap. Recently I've been much preferred the feel of narrower IPD, with more 3D and immersion. I don't notice any difference at all between my 2nd Bobo under different branding, compared to the first on release last year. The 2nd one is much better though with the perforated pvc padding rather than foam, and longer jack lead to plug into my LG G4 without using an extension.  </TEXT>

When she's on the ship, she unzips a compartment and takes out an egg, sort of splooges it into the corner of a room, then unzips another compartment to drink from a HR Giger branded water bottle before sharpening her tail then hiding. But Gale said we should cut it because of time, we already had to lose reel 4 and the backpack/waterbottle merchandise tie-in deal fell through so yeah, we had to lose it.

<TEXT> You are absolutely right, excellent post. Not only that, many hypnotherapists market shockingly inaccurate things, and cannot leave their egotistical bubbles to even contemplate what their customer is actually looking for. They literally think the customer is there to say "wow, you're so knowledgeable and powerful, here, take my money".   

I used to be a hypnotherapist/hypnotist and also marketed adwords for other small businesses (I recognised the importance of marketing so naturally read up and got good at it). Once I marketed a special territorial deal for hypnotherapists, ready made with relevant keyword combinations etc. Wow - the dialogues I got into with hypnotherapists were amazing. They were incredibly ignorant, defensive, and massively obtuse. Some were just total assholes. I stopped it in the end and focused on other niches, they weren't worth the effort and I was happy to watch them crash and burn with a total lack of clients.  </TEXT>

Basically, people respond differently *because of what they do in their heads*. You need decent, specific instructions and you need to do them, rather than be distracted by your own thoughts. Essentially you just need to imagine the right things, until you forget that you're imagining them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would disagree on that. Gosling is good at what he does, but having more range? The difference between his subdued mode and slightly-more-expressive really isn't that great, with everything else (e.g Fracture, Only God Forgives) falling somewhere in between.   

McAvoy's range between say Atonement and Filth, or even *within* Split is pretty extraordinary. He seems to encapsulate his characters with his whole being. Psychopaths, everyman, comedy. I just can't see how you can say he hasn't shown that range when he clearly has.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course, complete idiot or not, anything you laugh at will seem funny *to you*. There could still be a disparity between what a person finds funny, and what the film is *intending* to be funny. If a film shows a section that is supposed to be serious, and people laugh (for example, because they think it looks silly), hopefully you can appreciate that their response might be one of awkwardness, even nervousness, at how misjudged and off-key the film is?   

But more to the point, /u/Psittacula2 was usefully explaining how an audience could be embarrassed or awkward about a trailer, and rather than considering that you just considered your own reactions. Coupled with your other reply, I have to wonder whether you're able to apply theory of mind or empathise with others on any level, and its no wonder that my first comment was the "strangest sentences" you'd read in "some time".

<TEXT> You do not need to "watch" an audience's reactions to be aware of them. As mentioned, its *audible*, and there are plenty of cues and indications as to how an audience is responding to something. Being sat in a dark room, or making up your own mind vs following a mass has *absolutely nothing* to do with it. There is nothing inherently bad or inappropriate about making inferences based on such cues, its part of social awareness.  

Yes, you could just as easily say what you did, and if you had, it would have been fine. I've had many experiences of audiences being pumped for an awesome trailer, have you not? The cues would be people cheering or gasping in the right places, perhaps hearing whispers about how great it looked.  

You made two question marks after the term "knowing way" so I'll just explain that. It means a film is a little cheesy and *knows* its cheesy - e.g. Independence Day Resurgence. When I said "not in a knowing way" I meant that the film doesn't seem to be aware of its own cheesiness, it seems to take itself more seriously like Game Of Thrones or something. Does that make sense now?  

You seem to have a bizarrely overt and negative sensitivity to the idea of gauging other peoples responses, indeed it even seeming like the strangest thing to you. Do you have Asperger's at all?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It usually has accompanying bits of dialogue like "that can't be right!" "Maybe you're not reading it right!" or maybe characters just believing it must be a glitch. But then it turns into something awful that throws the rest of the film into anarchy. 

Examples - the planes changing course on the screens in United 93, the spreadsheet in Margin Call, the cyclone in Day After Tomorrow, the anomalous signal in Contact.    

I know there are some really cool ones, I love those scenes and the atmosphere where some crazy event starts with an innocuous blip on a screen.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Goodness, that would take all day. Technically its brilliant, the acting, writing, production design, editing, music (both score and songs) and cinematography are all top notch. There are so many nice touches, like when he runs up the stairs, the keys falling from the window, the taxi ride, the sweeping camera movements in the office, along the road by the diner, and in the apartment, the rapid-fire editing of the burns book. So many details. The characters are ALL really credible, nuanced, interesting and quirky. The mysteries that start to unfurl and stack on each other, like the history of Marcy, her weird rape story, the crossed out names, the newspaper cutting on the sculpture, the woman who randomly shoots the guy in another apartment. The characters are so credible that even their own back-stories are curious, like why catherine o-hara is so fucking weird and enjoys trying to disrupt him when he's remembering the phone number. What does John Heard see in Marcy? Whats the history between Marcy and the other cafe owner? What's the deal with Kiki and her S M boyfriend? Normally when films try to be quirky its self-conscious, gimmicky and annoying, but in After Hours it feels so real and deserved. Even the first cafe scene where Marcy rushes over to talk to Paul, but then rather than listening to what he's saying she rudely watches over his shoulder at the till guy practicising dance moves. He's irritated by her, but overlooks it through his desperation to get laid. The atmosphere of the whole night with all the weird quirky details feels EXACTLY like my summer as a late teenager in New York, where everything you try to do just spirals out into weird unpredictability, mainly because of the people and their stories. On another level, I hugely relate to his character trying to reach out and connect to someone, hitting that point where he thinks "fuck, is this still worth it?" decides to invest more time because "what the hell" but then it just gets worse. How completely other worldly people seem, and locked in the bubbles of their own story. Like no one ever asks about him or gets to know him, he's just unbelonging to this weird world that's "after hours" and wishes he'd just stayed at home and jacked off. Its also just so funny, especially the end where he says "I just want to live", gets into that nice slow dance with a woman he's absolutely not attracted to, listens to the relevant "Is That All There Is?" by Peggy Lee, finds himself finally connecting to someone, and then just as the song is about to reveal the singers thoughts about death, all hell breaks loose when the vigilante mob breaks in. I've seen it so many times and love it just as much each time. It has a life of its own, like a good Coen bros movie.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have great taste! Its such a deeply enriched and atmospheric film. The characters are SO well drawn and believable, the little strange details, the amount of things which get started but not finished (eg his story about having his eyes bandaged, even the sculptures). Normally with a quirky film like this it would dated and tacky by now, but Scorsese's direction and the camera work really lift it into brilliance. It really hasn't dated at all, it barely even looks 80s (maybe just the computers in the opening/closing scenes).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Stop being a dick. It was a highly original script, was daring enough to cross a heist film with psychology, a great soundtrack, fun performances, and very meticulous direction. Its also intriguing from a layers point of view. Didn't you stop to consider that the whole film is metaphorical therapy session revolving around letting go of guilt, and adrianne is the therapist? Watched like this it works like a companion piece to Shutter Island.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are a few excellent, lesser known single season shows. One is Rubicon, a corporate conspiracy thriller, thsts shot and directed like a David Fincher film. Its brilliant. Also, Day Break, which is like 24 crossed with Groundhog Day. Guy keeps waking up on the same day, and uses the clues he can find by trying new things to clear his name of murder and find the real culprit. Its great fun and really well written in terms of structure.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Slightly off topic, but I always wonder why cinemas don't show older films for cheaper on quieter days (normally mon/tues). An arthouse cinema near me sometimes shows older films like Goodfellas, Batman etc but tickets are always 11 and the screenings are always practically empty. Its no surprise really when you can buy the bluray for half the price. I went to see Quadrophenia and was dismayed to actually have to see someone navigating a bluray menu screen. Projecting blurays is hardly as expensive as the old days of renting actual cinema reels. I used to enjoy seeing classics at the cinema, but these days I'd much prefer to see them at home where its free, and the screen size is just the same (in terms of perspective). However, if the tickets were something like 3-4, it would be worth going to just for the shared atmosphere and meeting other like minded people etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> But the point is that he barely knows Kevin. He didn't really know him then, and much less so now - he just *imagines* a connection because of what happened. That's why its tragic to watch unfold. Its misplaced and naive - but thats because by then Chiron is so sexually immature and inexperienced.  

He becomes frail and vulnerable because hes anchored back to that moment as a kid. He hasn't learned to deal with or accept his own sexuality, so the moment he goes there, he regresses back to that moment. Anyone who builds a facade like that will have moments of regression where they're anchored back to their more vulnerable self - its a mistake to think this is caused by *love* and in my opinion an overly simplistic interpretation of the scene.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting, I agree with you. I read before seeing that it was a film about growing up, being a man, finding yourself, accepting yourself, and was expecting something within Chiron to stand forth and take ownership of his trajectory. But that never happened.   

So after his lack of a caring parent and acceptance growing up (although he still *had* moments of raw acceptance, which not everyone does), he never develops the confidence to remotely embrace or explore his sexuality, against all his instincts, and despite finding confidence in other areas, until *years* later. Then he selfishly reaches out to someone on the back of some misunderstood clumsy moment masquerading as affection, despite that persons own development and life stability. It felt like a very cynical exploration of the human condition, basically telling us that life circumstances can trap a person beyond their power to see beyond it. Thats great, and probably true, but I'm not sure its the message that people need who might be in that situation. It offers no causal power of its own to influence people in a positive way.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure the film was trying to say that at all, and certainly not hinting at anything resembling "love". "Deep and affectionate love" are you kidding me? Kevin wanked him off on a beach with no real affection at all, then joins in bullying and sending Chiron's life on a trajectory. Chiron reaching out to Kevin isn't really anything to do with love, but a desperate need for (misplaced) connection. Kevin really doesn't care by this point, he pities Chiron and has his own life sorted out. I saw it more about how people end up unwittingly using each other for selfish gratification, and the complex consequences of that.  

I saw a great film recently called Disconnect (2012) with a subplot that touched similar themes. Two school kids connect with another online they're trying to bully, and it has grave consequences. Weaved within though is a lot of subtext about one of the bully's own vulnerability and causality, who secretly empathises and admires his victim. It actually moved me far more than Moonlight, it was subtle but explored the ideas in the context of a much bigger exploration of connection, selfishness, the fragility of love etc. For me, Moonlight in contrast felt much *lesser* than the sum of its parts, but I'm glad you got a lot out of it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is great. I love the soundtrack too. Glazer's films all have this timeless, rewatchable Kubrick quality to them. There's a certain precision mixed with the ballsiness of what happens. I really wished he made more movies. I use so many quotes from Sexy Beast on a daily basis. Even when eating out with my parents, I'll look at the menu and say "I'm avin' the calimari", get a sly look from my dad, and my mum won't have a clue what we're referencing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely. The build up was so well paced and subtle in how it gradually upped the ante, I didn't realise how much my emotions had built up until that moment smashed them. As well as the tech colliding with humanity theme, I loved the exploration of what affects intimacy. Some of the relationship trajectories (e.g. Boyd father realising he doesn't know his son, how consequences of losing a wife or son affect relationships) felt so refreshingly well drawn and real, without forcing the audience to take sides. Such a great film.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This film was amazing. It felt like an extended Black Mirror episode with the structure of Crash (2004), but more about a theme of how distant, anonymous connections collide with intimate, familial ones (kind of). The acting, characters, writing, editing and directing were all excellent. It deserved a best picture nominee, and is certainly a lot better than Crash. There's a plot strand that I found far more moving and honest than the whole of Moonlight. 

Edit: [IMDB link](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1433811/) (scored 7.6).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would love to have seen a version that was more like the original Westworld. I find all the characters in JP cartooney and unrealistic - Richard Attenborough's pompous scientist acting like his Santa Claus in Miracle on 34th St, Laura Dern looking at dinosaur shit like fairies were dancing on it, the annoying kids. All those glances between Sam and Laura with Laura smiling about the kids - its vomit inducing. The guy trying to steal the eggs, ugh. Weirdly Sam Jackson feels like the more grounded character of the bunch and I would never normally say that about a film with Sam Jackson. If it had more mature, grounded characters across the board, some wealthy older investors who visit the park, and then darkness and rain falls and they get chased/maimed/eaten and find their pretentious wealth douchiness gets stripped away as they survive and struggle through mud and blood, I'd have much preferred it. I want it looking like the gorier moments of The Descent, having the suspense and excitement of Aliens, and the survivalist elements of the last section of Predator.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> My problem here is that too many films are being released where scripts are serving some existing structure, be it a sequel, universe or whatever, rather than *telling a story that's worth telling*. I would never enjoy a film purely because it belonged to some universe, and only would if it told a *good story worth telling*. Split kind of did the opposite in telling a story and then shoe-horning it into an existing universe, which I feel mixed about. Its cute, but its not necessary to the story.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always noticed that. Also, his rock is enough to crack the pipe, but how the hell does he create a big enough hole for his body to get through? If the pipe goes so easily to the outside (and by that, I mean in a straight line), why has a reverse situation never happened where someone crawls *in*, uses tool to create a hole in the pipe, chips away at the wall to break someone out? Why was his chipped away hole so flippin' big and circular, why not just what was necessary to crawl out? Why wasn't a draft blowing from the outside through the hole and the loose poster? How did Andy know there would be a lightning storm the night he wore the governer's shoes out and took his accounts? Wasn't it a bit of a risk to take the shoes anyway, Red's thing of "when do you ever notice a guys shoes" isn't exactly realistic when the warden's ears are used to hearing a non-cloppy prison-issue shoe? How did Andy know his cell was next to a room with a man-size sewer pipe that led directly (and in a straight line) to the outside? What if he spent decades building that hole then they switched his cell?  

All is forgiven though for that bit where the governer holds his hammer-concealing bible and says "redemption lies within". Classy.      </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I saw Jurassic Park at the cinema on release, I was 14 years old - and felt exactly the same way. I was quite into films then (I was proud of my Kubrick collection, Westworld and Blood Simple ex-rentals), and was expecting Jurassic Park to be far more grittier and sinister like Westworld. I hated the shiny self-consciousness and those stupid bratty kids. Even Sam Neill and Goldblum just felt like self-conscious actors in a sure-fire blockbuster. I've watched it a few times since and really wanted to love it as everyone else does, but it always feels too forced and childish.  </TEXT>

I find people who don't like Sandra Bullock, Clooney or hyped films in general will go to great lengths to rip into it, whilst those who are in sync will defend such nitpicks. I'd argue for example that The Terminator, Robocop, Teen Wolf or Flight of the Navigator are unbelievable as films, but I wouldn't use it against them. I don't think Gravity was trying to be a documentary, I saw it more as a visual poem.  </TEXT>

I had it like that for a whole year, before discovering that I could set the IPD to be closer, but the lenses further away. The difference in having the IPD closer is that you get more overlap of a 3D area, but less width overall. I much prefer it this way for using the Cmoar cinema app.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Another bad example would be Terminator Salvation - but look how terrible his forced performance was in that. And it appeared that he took that *very* seriously from his on-set outbursts. With The Big Short, I loved Carrel's performance, but still found Bale stuck out as a kind of self-conscious actor. I can't put my finger on it, but the way he does his American accent, forces these little nuances etc, it just jars with me subconsciously in the same way as a CGI effect. I just can't buy into it. I haven't seen the Malick films to offer an opinion on unfortunately but glad to hear his performance is raised a bar in those.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's absolutely not true. Hoffman's performance was very consistent, and once he nailed his impression of an autistic guy there really isn't much more to it. Cruise's character evolves and changes, recognises a reservoir of repressed emotions within himself. I really think you're coming from what you remember and imagine the film to be, not how it actually is.

<TEXT> Most of the films aspects were based on truth, and sometimes real life IS cliched and full of standard tropes. Not every big film needs to be all original though - for me it was refreshing in how unashamed it was to be a solid genre film in an old fashioned way, like a fable. Im honestly surprised how many people bitch and whine about all these pedantic aspects without just appreciating the amazing story of Desmond Doss and how solidly Gibson brought it to the screen.  </TEXT>

When watching it though, I thought "oh, becoming a kind of vigilante detective to get back some homely thing that was stolen, that reminds me of Big Lebowski". Then when Eli Wood's character is gung-ho military, I thought "ha, that reminds me of Walter from Big Lebowski". Then the scene where she wrecks something out the front of a surburban house... etc. It just felt like a few too many "inspired" aspects.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree. The most frustrating thing about it was that all this set-up and context hinted at what *could* have been an amazing film. I hate it when a film takes an interesting concept and just drives it hard into the ground. The second half felt like it was being written as it went, with no real overall point, theme or sense of purpose. The forced climax which I can barely even remember, something about fixing a drive or something, was like something you'd get in one of the more boring episodes of a kids cartoon.  </TEXT>

I think anyone who strives for the best and feels frustrated by the barriers of common human nature is going to come across as an asshole at times, e.g. James Cameron also.   

And yes, Gates was influenced by appearing on screen at one of Jobs launches, where the audience booed and hissed him. He then compensated for his obviously bad image (despite it being from fans of the opposition). I think they're both just different people who contributed a lot in various ways.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK I have massive problems with this film too, but they aren't the same as yours. I saw it at a preview before general release, and at the time the reception was unanimously positive - I had a thread on IMDB (RIP) that gathered traction as more people saw it. Anyway, my issues with it are:  

- the other characters are fairly flat and boring, without much development. Because of this, I find it quite boring on a rewatch.  

- the "twist" feels like a contrivance. It makes the audience believe one thing about the central character, which isn't true. This makes us empathise/sympathise with her in a way that isn't earned. So when the twist happens, I waste time unravelling what I thought I knew about the character, realise I know nothing at all, then think even less of the overall character development. Basically, the one character you think you know the depth of, you don't.   

- the film didn't need its twist. The book didn't have it. I feel like it was forced in as a kind of gimmick, which doesn't help at all in exploring the central idea of the film, it just delays and confuses it. If we knew from the start that she had never had children, and could then experience her flashes as she does, without the false belief that they're flashbacks, it would have been a more honest film and allowed us to empathise with her in a more genuine way.     

- the central idea of how she handles the premonitions is messy. In the book time is completely set, and she experiences awareness of the future whilst being compelled towards it, acting everything out exactly as she knew she would. Its set - it can't be changed. The cost of awareness is losing the ability to choose anything. In the film its made out that she chooses to have the baby despite knowing its future, because its "beautiful anyway" and all that guff. This just raises too many hypothetical paradoxes that break the (interesting) idea of the original story.   

- I find the direction far too manipulative. As well as the forced twist, the use of emotional flashes, orchestral music swelling towards the end, corny-as-fuck dialogue etc just trying to ramp up the audiences suggestibility to the idea its a big, important film. It barely even explores its central idea because it wastes too much time on dull alien visit scenes and all those fucking ink circles.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I think one of the most important factors in producing the kind of insanity seen in Room 237 is spending too much time with a topic, and your own thoughts on that topic.  

This really doesnt make any sense. There is no logical correlation between how long a person spends with a topic and how irrational they become. Normally they just become experts on the topic, and there are plenty of people very knowledgeable about topics theyre interested in. Linking it to "your own thoughts on that topic" is a purely circular argument, like saying "people think crazy things about something because of their thoughts about it".  

Of course theres a huge spectrum where peoples individual reality varies from actual reality. Sometimes it leads to great ideas, art and culture, sometimes it leads to crazy theories and interpretations. If its about a movie, who cares? Its religious fundamentalists and those actively trying to enforce their deluded reality that you should be worried about.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like Alien 3 a lot. I like its uniqueness, ballsiness, and being a sequel with its own subtext (AIDS, death, religion etc) and interesting characters. It has a great soundtrack too, and some of the shots are amazing. The CGI looks a little shoddy now, but then the alien was only ever a catalyst for the themes and story rather than the main focus. People bitch about hicks/newt being killed off, but I always saw that as an important intro to the death theme, and something that Ripley is grieving and coming to terms with as the story unfolds.  </TEXT>

Yet another story of how companies are being absolute *cunts*, making people suffer unnecessarily (imagine all the people who get caught out on losing their "reservation fee" for silly reasons) and getting away with it because no one is watching or motivated enough to do anything about it. Meanwhile they get wealthily plump along with the landlords, whilst the people paying the money struggle on. Its just so damn sad. I really hate estate agents with a passion, every single time I've had anything to do with them they've made endless mistakes and been lazy and incompetent, whilst ensuring that you of course pay every penny you owe them on time.  </TEXT>

You have this guy who does bad, knows he does bad, and then acts like he's rolling around in his badness, all with a self-conscious "hey, I'm a villain!" pantomime vibe. I much prefer villains who think they're doing the right thing (in the way that everyone thinks they're doing the right thing), but their reality is just distorted enough that it doesn't match ours, so looks "bad" from our perspective. Its a far more credible and chilling approach to a character who does bad things.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I use an LG G4 (any modern phone with a 1440 x 2560 res or above and a gyro should be fine), a BoboVR Z4 ($25-30ish, has built in headphones) and cmoar cinema app (about $5, there are other free ones).   

The experience is like being sat in the middle of a big screened theater. You can look around at the seats, which even reflect the light of the film, or make it you can only see the screen. Its truly immersive. The screen feels huge (its adjustable), sharp (especially with 1080p files), and the right distance away. I've used it to watch stuff like Aliens, Escape from New York, Blood Simple/No Country, Bladerunner. Its like being at the cinema but without distractions, I find myself absorbed in a completely different way to the normal TV.   

If you've tried it, what did you think?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've seen Alien three times at the cinema, and every single time it was a claustrophobic, amazing cinema experience where the whole cinema was engaged in the shared experience. Even though we'd all no doubt seen it a bunch of times. I can't think of another film that even approaches it in that regard. Two of the showings were double bills with Aliens, and whilst Aliens is a great film it felt more TV-ish and less engaging than Alien when seen straight afterwards.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think though, that shooting efficiency is a variable which changes depending on the approach to production. When film was used and budget was much more of a concern, producers would meticulously plan each shot beforehand so as not to waste any. Shooting hours of footage would then be more an issue of choosing which takes to use. Take Primer for example, as complex as that film is, Carruth knew exactly what he wanted to the extent that the ratio of what was shot to what was used was something like 4:3 (i.e. very efficient).  

I can understand that editing is a ton of work, but if whole scenes and characters are being shuffled or deleted, then it would just suggest that the script wasn't perfect/ready to begin with. Not a bad thing, this was exactly the case with Die Hard, but its not always the case with a film shoot. I heard the Coens are ruthlessly efficient with their writing and planning too.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> With the large letter size though, the issue is this. Say you have a very light jiffy bag, it bulges slightly half way. You could easily squash it to well within 2.5cm, but it slowly bulges out again. Because its so light, when its dropped through, it gets caught on the slot. A gentle push will easily push it through. Putting slightly more weight in the envelope would push it through due to gravity. But some postmasters let it get caught, then charge a small package, whilst others are more than happy to offer the *slightest* effort to push it through.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In fairness to OP, your lack of "evidence" also doesn't suggest it *isn't* happening, so doesn't form a logical argument for its absence. It quite obviously *is* happening, most people accept that IMDB contains shill reviews, the plentiful one-review accounts are *very* suggestive of that. The anonymity (lack of evidence) is exactly why its such an easy way for people to help influence perception of a film. You'd have to be pretty biased yourself not to at least acknowledge that, regardless of JW2. I'm not a fan of the film either, but am astonished that this thread has gone the way it has.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its not about disagreeing with the wave of popular opinion, its about how much of an imbalance there is between the later reviews, and the early ones. I agree entirely with OP in that the early reviews were suspiciously overhyped, compared to the overall disappointment on the official discussion board. Manchester By The Sea has had a fairly consistent pattern (mostly positive, occasional disappointments, exactly like La La Land and Moonlight).  

I think its massively unfair and odd to call OP a "little shit" for stating what seems to me a well formed argument that is more about the pattern than his/her individual taste. You hating on the OP is far worse to me than what you're accusing OP of, and completely contrary to "You won't find anyone more willing to discuss the quality and the reception of a movie than me" </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love it. Its absolutely a solid genre piece, a bit like Kurt Russell's Breakdown. *So what* if it slides into Silence of the Lambs cliche towards the end, I enjoy it regardless. Its not trying to be anything gimmicky or notable, its just a solid thriller that works.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel really conflicted about Split. Part of me wishes it had gone down the chilling suspense/horror road rather than self-conscious comic-book style film. In the hands of someone like Jeremy Saulnier (Green Room/Blue Ruin) the concept of it could have made for an insanely gritty and terrifying film, especially if a few different personalities all developed completely different relationships with the captives. if for example one was a sadist/rapist, the other a kind helper, the suspense of the kind helper helping a girl through a precarious vent or something and not knowing if he was suddenly about to turn into the sadist would be really effective.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> So the OP says about taking two days to take in ID, getting sacked etc, and you use that to "paint a picture". Which is ambiguous, and doesn't really mean anything. But, there's a clear implication, which I call out as unfair. You then get uppity about words being "put in your mouth" because you couldn't be clear to begin with. You then explain that you think the OP is *lying outright about everything*, an assumption which is somehow tied to the picture you painted because they took two days to take in ID, got sacked, and whatever else it was. That makes no real sense to me. You make a leap from trying to paint a picture of someone who is leaving things out as being unreliable, to outright lying about everything.   

My point is that it doesn't matter what the OP left out, because no context is appropriate for a security guard to grab someones neck like that and threaten their life. If you're doubting that happened because the OP left things out, then you're just a doubting kind of person, which is a shame because some people are genuinely in need of some compassion.   

I'm not getting mardy about anything, I was trying to understand what the fuck your point was. DON'T PUT WORDS INTO MY MOUTH. For the fifth time. Jesus.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Willis really disappoints me. Even in interviews he's sort of checked out and not quite there. He leans on his fame and recognition far too much, especially in his cameos like Planet Terror/Expendables/recent film (which I won't spoil as its still in theaters) where he literally just tilts his head and implies "hey audience, look its me, Bruce Willis". He needs to make a kick-ass revenge thriller like everyone else (there can never be enough) and become likable again.  </TEXT>

In writing a post like that there would naturally be a difficult balance to strike in giving the relevant information, without giving endless detail and justifications for every little thing. Especially if those things would just give the "no smoke without fire" crowd more cause to be contrary.    

Its irrelevant that OP took 2 days to take back ID. Its irrelevant that they were unemployed for a year. Its irrelevant they were sacked. Whatever picture you want to build of them, is also irrelevant. It has absolutely nothing to do with DWPs actions or how they handled the situation, which is what the post is about.  </TEXT>

Another cool eerie movie that I don't hear enough of is Seance on a Wet Afternoon, where a wannabe-psychic convinces her reluctant husband (Richard Attenborough) to kidnap a posh school girl, so she can hide her in a forest, tell the police where she is (as a psychic) and get publicity.

<TEXT> Gravity is the same as acceleration, so you can simply accelerate something to create artificial gravity. Likewise, you can use gravity to experience acceleration. For example, in simulator rides (where the screens are fixed to seats), when the seats momentarily tip backwards the mind experiences the feeling of gravity momentarily pushing from the front rather than above as a sense of acceleration. That's my bit, I'll leave others to talk about space stations.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Peter Jackson's "Dead Alive" (Braindead) is a trove of inventive special effects, they really went to town on that film. I miss practical effects, there's something so much more alluring and fascinating about them, even if they look a little odd (e.g. the latex skin in the Hellraiser tearing scene). My brain just instantly filters out CGI, it has no impact at all, whether its CGI blood sprays, heads exploding or whatever, it has no more effect than if it cut to a title card reading "head explodes".  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I bought a second hand Echo that turns out to be blacklisted, i.e. the serial number reports it as lost/stolen (the error code is "10:2:12:3:1" when registering, in case anyone else searches for the same error code and isn't sure what it means). No problem, I'll claim for a Paypal refund.   

However, I do feel bad for the original owners, and worse that there is absolutely nothing that can be done to reunite them with their Echo. Once a device is registered as lost/stolen, the only option for the owner is to find it/retrieve it again, and call Amazon to unblock it.   

Amazon aren't interested in sending an email to the original owner saying "hey, we know where your Amazon is", or giving me a return label so it can be sent back in, to then be sent back out to the original owner (even for a small postage fee from the original owner). Doesn't this seem like a tragic waste? I will end up having to throw this away, despite the fact that it belongs to someone else.  

Surely in the age of serial numbered, blockable wifi devices, it wouldn't take much to offer a recovery service to customers, because sooner or later their serial number is bound to be called in from the new unlucky "customer".  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep I have the same thoughts. There are so many little internal battles. Some epiphanies: you shouldnt live in a museum. Being distracted by the past will blind you to the present of who you are, and slow down progress. The value of those little moments of nostalgia doesnt outweigh the disadvantage of lost space and past-distraction. Really, those little nostalgia moments are never more than "huh, look at that, gee". One day, sooner or later, you probably will throw it away, so why not do it sooner. Waiting to feel ready is just continuing to be a slave to it. Somewhere in time, youre always enjoying your stuff, when you enjoyed it. Getting rid of it doesnt change that.  

My current niggle is value - I find it hard to throw something away, I feel I should sell it (which can be a hassle) or find someone who would benefit from it, but that becomes time consuming. E.g a bunch of dvds, it feels weird to just take them to a charity shop but eventually thats what needs to done </TEXT>

I watched it loads since, and listened to the excellent soundtrack probably more than any film. I love how the first half is a moody noirish arthouse mystery thriller, with the videotapes building this weird tension as you wonder about Renee having an affair and Pullman's growing awareness of it. Then the second half goes in all sorts of directions. Its so weird and wonderful. I don't understand why Mulholland Drive overshadows it so much in terms of talk, LH for me is a much more interesting film.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just found out and am gutted. The boards were perfect for exploring details and sharing info with like minded fans. You could go on a board for an old obscure 80s movie after watching and delve into a trove of discussion, read something from an extra, a relative of an actor or something, and learn all sorts. NOTHING will replace it for those post-viewing indulgences. I even made some friends by spotting familiar names on boards I visited for favourite films. Im absolutely gutted.  

Its such a shame that a bunch of trolls led to its demise. Im sure outside of the 10% bloated traffic that the big new movies get on the boards, the rest of the boards were pretty sensible.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its so true. I've learned so much through decluttering. Its like "stuff" ends up having this subtle unconscious influence over your identity or something, because its always a reminder of the past, of perceived value, of something that will eventually need sorting or getting rid of. I find that minimizing gives that free, light feeling like being on vacation, where you're in the present and focused on the few things around you that you actually chose to be there.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recently I started decluttering, and selling stuff. Blurays that I haven't really cared about, old books, furniture, xbox, electronics etc. Its felt very liberating. The weird thing though is that the more I get rid of, the less I give a fuck about what's left. There's a momentum to the detachment.   

The process has led to a few inner discussions, like is something purely for me, or for the idea of what someone else might think. Like I had a bunch of movie stuff in the garage - it was actually getting in the way of my using my gym equipment, but I liked the idea of it, but mostly because of impressing others or expressing myself. Really though, no one gives a shit, and the things it says about it are probably way off what I was intending.   

Also, I love the feeling of not being distracted by stuff - it means that I'm only aware of/focusing on whatever is there at the time - a particular book or project for example. All this other shit used to be there lurking in the background, of reality as well as my subconscious mind.  

So Im wondering what other people's relationship is to "stuff". Do you collect, hoard, minimize?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love this film, and have a framed quad poster of it in my bedroom.   

The human mind is essentially very automatic, and responds to cues (whether internal or external). The perp takes advantage (in a skilled, knowing way) of certain contexts and responses - e.g. obedience to authority, fear of being or doing wrong, time pressure, wanting to help, response to flattery, reciprocal favors. He uses various shaming/pressure techniques to change the person's self-image to push those responses in his favor. I was really impressed with the writer/directors grasp of unconscious influence.  

As an aside, there were a whole series of similar real-world pranks, the recordings of which are available. Hotel guests were influenced to throw their TVs out of the window, drink urine, and even smear faeces on the windows. It sounds utterly insane, but when a person's reality is gradually altered, insanity can happen.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's interesting, I felt that way about Rear Window on first watch, but appreciated it more on the second watch (and third also). Hitchcock really does add a whole load of subtext, symbolism and psychology. Deliverance also holds up well in a timeless way. I think any film about universal concepts, or core truths about the human condition, if made well will be timeless. But AWIL was more just a shock piece of its time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its a great film. I love how Tommy Lee Jone's character, and his whole team, all have depth of character with quirky personalities. They feel real, which is something I don't feel in most movies. The action is efficient and tight, the story compelling and engaging. The only thing I wish is that Jerome Krabbe had more of a come-uppance at the end, after all that Kimble has been through. The music, direction and cinematography is brilliant too - all those high-rise city sweeps. Also, Julianne Moore's cool little cameo as a doctor. And that bit that was re-used in 24 where he gets shot in the face but with bullet-proof glass in the way.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me its one of those Twilight Zone films where a simple idea is dragged into a feature length, without the requisite story detail or intrigue to actually justify a feature length. On a rewatch its pretty boring for the most part, there just isn't much depth of character or subtlety. I really wish it had been a much more non-linear film, going to town with the time concept and showing the relevant stuff of the first half in flashback. I also agree with your last paragraph and feel that Split falls into this category.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess theyre like modern day TZ (which I love too). Only a few TZs approached genuinely eerie. When you think about why something is scary, its always because of a core fear (eg death, lack of control or something). Some films harness an element of that pretty well (eg It Follows). Black Mirror takes genuinely frightening ideas and delivers them well. For example, in the christmas one, in a brief scene a man gets "blocked" in the vision of everyone else he meets. Its just a brief idea, but such a terrifying thing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree the first scenes are rewatchable in a different light, as well as the later scene where she starts having flashes (around the time she dreams of an alien in her quarters). But the rest of it, i.e. all the bits with Forest Whitaker, approaching the ships, going in, the usual "yep that just happened" quips, the aliens and all the language stuff, everyone looking quizzical and bemused - all of that feels very pedestrian almost like a TV pilot for a new show on the syfy channel.  

I agree that normal quirky timeline films are rewatchable, but Arrival really doesn't go far with its central idea, the total running time of all those moments is probably less than 10 minutes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think his character in Social Network did have a good depth and range. He went from privileged supportive friend, to excited hopeful, to cautious controlling, to frustrated angry, to devastated/heartbroken/rageful, to repressed courtroom testimony. It was a great performance. Similarly in 99 Homes, it was a truly unconsciously convincing and engaging performance, subtle to the core and absolutely captivating. I'm not sure how you're not seeing that, perhaps you just have something against him (in the same way I expect Daniel Radcliffe to be bad and can't see otherwise).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The core concept of time being a solid block, and predetermined, is interesting, especially when tied to physics (which the short story does a little more). For example, how electrons seemingly "know" the potential paths available ahead of them before "choosing" which paths to take. I'm dying for a film to explore these concepts properly, because they really do undermine what we believe about ourselves, and the illusion of free will.   

Arrival tries, but its best ideas are so, so buried under a bunch of guff about alien language and overly sentimental emotional heart-string-pulling pap about her daughter, that the film doesn't really explore them all. They're reduced to a kind of "a ha!" twist and idea.   

I tried rewatching Arrival to get at those core ideas more, but it was so dull. All the military/alien stuff really is boring as hell on second watch, there's nothing really thoughtful, interesting or atmospheric  about any of that stuff.  </TEXT>

The woman's link ("oh, that reminds me what happened to that guy who died in prison 15 years ago, what was his name again?") before panning to Willis is so ridiculously weak and tenuous. Why would she remember the incident but forget such an iconic name? What does the implied incident have to do with what she had just seen on TV, being that Mr Glass has absolutely nothing to do with DID? And Willis's face, doing his "hey everyone, its me!" face from Expendables, Planet Terror and everything else in recent years. I don't see how an implication, like "hey, its part of the universe of this other film!" changes anything about the actual film/story itself to make it somehow "fucking phenomenal".  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually agree. I saw an early preview last year and seemed to the only one who didnt think it was amazing. I also found the handling of the twist forced and annoying, although I did find the central idea of it interesting (not that the film really did it justice in terms of an emotional exploration). I saw it again months later to give it another chance (sometimes my own life events/expectations might filter my perception). But it was actually painfully boring the second time. It doesnt reward rewatches at all - the characters are flat and uninteresting, Adams spends the whole film looking bewildered, the alien and language stuff just feels repetitive. Once you know the film and its mechanics, there really isnt much more to absorb at all.  </TEXT>

You do realise it was a science fiction, right? I dont think any language is going to allow what happens in the movie.

<TEXT> Hi, I always took it to be about how easily we forget ourselves, our true worth and value. Underneath all the distractions, self-doubts and noise, we're all (mostly) amazing people and capable of feeling and giving so much. So, to attain those special states of zen-awareness and gratitude, its not about acquiring or striving, but letting go and seeing through the noise. Something that's available to everyone at any time.

For some reason (and I have no problems at all with the Z4) my eyes have to be really close to the lenses, and occasionally knock them out of focus. Or, rubbing away mist messes up the focus. It just gets annoying. The Z4 is by far the most user-friendly unit, especially the later editions with the longer headphone jack and nice pvc padding.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just can't agree with that. I generally do like to watch most films in one sitting, but I have absolutely no problem at all with breaking a film into multiple sections, even across weeks.   

Here's the thing. After a duration, even if you're paying attention to a film, certain things start to get taken for granted or glazed over. At the beginning you might be paying attention to all sorts, but then by the end not so much. I find that when I break a film, when I return to it, I tend to be much more sharply engaged than if I'd watched it all in one go. I have a harddrive loaded with films for the bedroom TV, and I frequently will skip to a random part of a film to just watch from there. I really enjoy doing this, I sometimes notice new things because I'm so into whatever it is.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> All good points. Just to clarify on why I found those bits immature - so there's a whole back-story to the girl that slowly unfolds via flashback, which serves one sole purpose - to tell us (eventually) that she was abused, and then self-harms. Its taking a heavy subject matter (that shouldn't be taken lightly, considering the frighteningly large proportion of girls who have suffered some kind of sexual abuse), only to use as a plot device when the beast decides she isn't sheltered enough to warrant killing. He calls her "pure" instead. It then seems incongruent that the girl would hang out with the two popular girls, accept a ride with a man she doesn't know, and a bunch of other stuff. It just seemed a tacky way of using the context of abuse/self-harm, making all sorts of implications about it (almost glorifying it in terms of her being saved, and being prioritised above the other girls in terms of the story), only to serve a silly plot-device before whisking the audience away to the silly final scene.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I loved McAvoy's performance (as I think everyone did), but outside of that it wasn't very imaginative or interesting at all. The psychotherapist was ridiculously cliched and stereotyped, providing endless (and boring) exposition. The girls were smarter than your average movie captives but those scenes were still very samey (after seeing 10 Cloverfield Land, Room, Green Room etc). The shoe-horning in of heavy issues like sexual abuse and self-harm felt really trite and immature in what was essential a black comedy comic book movie. Really, I think it was an average shitty film outside of McAvoy's performance, unless you're a mid teenager perhaps.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its one of those films that plugs the message "be free! Do what you want!" in a dishonest way, because it appeals to a certain demographic (ironically the kind who hate their lives and fantasize about escaping, so the film is more a tease in the same way that superhero films are a tease to people's unconscious wants for more power and control over their oppressors). The guy has a good job but smugly walks out on it. This teaches that you have to keep running away from things to find yourself, rather than just have the courage to accept yourself. He could have made so much more of his opportunity at work, and found lasting happiness that way. But no - this is Ben Stiller - so within his little vanity-fest are more useful lessons for the young and impressionable, like how its hilarious to fly a helicoptor drunk, or skateboard down a huge hill without training as long as you're listening to cool music and "feeling alive, man!". Then, the film blatantly rubs a bunch of sponsorship in your face by way of Papa Johns, just to remind the audience "hey, whilst you're all suggestible to this nonsensical, contrived whimsy with no basis in real life and without a message that means anything useful, don't forget that we're making a bunch of cash from your ticket, and all these sponsors. You suckers!" Its almost like the film equivalent of a Tony Robbins seminar - empty, vacuous tripe masquerading as something life-enhancing, who's only purpose is to make a bunch of money.   </TEXT>

After release, buzz and hype, people I've shown it to mostly don't gel with it. I think people immediately put their guard up, with a kind of "ok, come on then, scare me" mentality, rather than really being in sync with the film and what it is.  </TEXT>

The story was perfectly balanced, feeling like a bigger film but afraid to be small and quirky either. I really wasn't prepared for the ending, it lodged a haunting thought so deep in my mind I can't shake it. Few films have that power.  

I think it will win best picture, but its a shame that the hype will then likely smother it and ruin its low-key feel. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I absolutely hated Good Kill, and found EITS much more interesting. GK was such a dull film, and so massively clichd. Smoking, punching mirrors, acting distant and frustrated at bbqs, it was almost satirical. I actually wish EITS had been more satirical, it would have been great as a Dr strangelove/in the loop style film.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pain and Gain is one of my favourite films, Ive seen it maybe six times so far which is unusual for me for a modern film. I love the soundtrack, satire, editing, acting, color saturated shots, and energy.  

Also, The Living Daylights is my favourite Bond film by far, and in my top ten of all time (Im talking personal favourites here, not saying its one of the ten best films ever made, although I do think its hugely underrated as a Bond script).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is why random opinions have no real value if someone is about to watch a film anyway. They influence the perception rigjt off the bat because the viewer is more likely (even if unconsciously) to see through a negative lens. Eye In The Sky was one of my favourite cinema experiences of last year, when seeing a preview before knowing anything about it. Reading your line beforehand though, I can see how someone would look at it negatively instead.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you were too bound by your expectations to see the film for what it actually was. There is far more than what you noticed, especially around the ambiguity of the word "drive" and how characters are motivated. Maybe in a few years when you've flushed your expectations and resistances, you'll appreciate it in a different way.  

Drive can seem a little pretentious though, especially if you notice the repetitive teal/orange color pallette. The soundtrack and retro vibes redeems it a little.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After playing a bunch throughout the year (mostly shit that gets boring after a minute or so), my favourites by far have been Gravity Pull (would love more levels/gimmicks on this one), Hardcode (would love more levels, and much prefer the collect levels to the shoot endless baddies ones), Retro Wrong demo and Wrong Level (both incredibly atmospheric and immersive, and decent lengths too). I would love to see more like the latter two, I love the sense of space and huge abstract structures.  Retro Wrong demo is actually my favourite game so far in terms of variety, gameplay, atmosphere. The darker levels are also pretty frightening in places like where the skeletons come rushing out at you, and I like that the levels have their own unique feels and ideas.  

Mostly I've found the gamepad controlled shooters (zombies etc) to be pretty lame, its quite hard to aim with your head and they just get repetitive after a while.  

Mostly though, games seem to just be incredibly short or show some promise without being properly developed. I'm not sure why there arent more developed/complete games for Cardboard, I would happily pay for a decent, bigger version of Wrong Level for example and I'm sure others would too.  

I find the space shooters mostly repetitive and not interesting enough to want to return to. I love the immersive feel of good space apps but most of them are pretty lame. Returning Home is amazingly good in terms of relaxing atmosphere and epic James Cameron feel, I wish they would build a great game around it. E.g. being sent to various space stations to collect/fix/eliminate things would be awesome.  

What are your favourite games? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Superman II gave me a false memory for 30 years - what false memories did you get from childhood movies? </TITLE>

<TEXT> *** Superman II spoilers follow ***

Superman crushing Zods hand In Superman II was one of the most cinematic, exciting moments of my childhood. I was so gutted that Luthor ratted out his plan, and that he'd lost his powers *again*. I could have cried. So the surprise and awesome turnaround in that moment was mind-blowing.   

But - for 30 years, even with all the TV repeats, I distinctly remember seeing Superman CRUSH Zods hand. I always saw it as a prosthetic hand, that Superman actually does crush, before cutting to Terence Stamp's actual, non-crushed hand as he flings it away (which even as a kid I saw as a continuity niggle).   

So watching on Bluray over the weekend I was amazed to see that he doesn't crush his hand at all - it just seems that way from the bone-crunching sound effects and Zod's "aarrggghhh". If you watch it on mute, it just looks like a tight grip. I couldn't believe it.  I still think its the best superhero film of all time. 

Also, I remembered his trek back to his ice-home to get his powers back taking *days*, like it was a real endeavor that takes up a lot of screentime. But in reality it takes about 10 seconds. The time from his losing his powers to getting them back again is about 5 minutes, basically the scene in the diner.   

**TL,DR: Superman doesn't actually crush Zod's hand, just grips it tightly.** 

What films tricked you into remembering something that didn't actually happen? Another example is the ear-cutting scene in Reservoir Dogs - always surprises me when the camera pans as if its a censored version, I imagined it so strongly on first watch that I remember my imagination more than the film.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Post Offices asking whats inside your parcel... then discussing it </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-11 10:51:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I find it infuriating in Post Offices when they ask whats inside whatever you're sending. As if trying to catch out customers who are sending batteries, or flammables, or bombs or whatever.  

I can half understand the safety angle, although it would be easier to just ask "does it contain any of these items? No? Good", because you could just answer anything. These days I just say "socks, biscuits, no batteries" whatever it is.  

My main frustration is where the ill-trained, nosy tosspots in Post Offices (particularly the smaller town/village ones) then use it as a point of discussion. I want to say "actually its none of your business" but that would risk "suspicion".  

The other day I was posting a small quadcopter sold on ebay, the guy then asked "how many of those do you sell then? Do you make a profit do you? Where did you get that then, from China?" On another item when saying it had no batteries, an old lady serving another customer with food next to the post office bit who was listening in (as they all seem to do) screws her face up and says "how does it work then?" to which I said "the person uses their own batteries". She looked at me like I was trying to send anthrax or something. Then I've had staff stalling what they're supposed to be doing whilst they ask me more about what I was sending as if they're interested in buying whatever it is, with the building queue behind listening to every word. I just find it embarrassing, and it goes well beyond the point of why they're asking.  

Don't even get me started on how they mix up 1st/2nd class about 30% of the time because they aren't listening.  

Although I like the connection/face-to-face of places like banks, shops and supermarkets, the Post Office is one place where I can't wait for automation to take over, the sooner I can just scan, pay and send stuff with a machine, the better.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was watching **Westworld** again recently and realised that the Yul Brynner's robot doesn't kill anyone until after an hour into the movie. The first signs of things going wrong don't even happen until about 55 minutes in. That's almost an hour of set-up, for a less than twenty minute climactic chase scene, for which the film is mostly remembered.  

I remember **Home Alone** as Kevin setting traps for the burglars, but weirdly the traps scene only happens within the last ten minutes of the film.   

**No Way Out** - I remember the film being about the feds closing in on Kevin Costner's framed character, with the polaroid gradually scanning. I thought that all started after perhaps 15 minutes, but it actually starts half-way through the film. The first half is all used to set up the second half, for which the film is mostly remembered.

<TITLE> Why I love Pain and Gain (2013) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-02 12:42:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What do you think of Pain and Gain? 

I think it suffers from a massive case of negative bias, because its rare that a typically trashy director could pull off something brilliant. I'm pretty sure if it was a subtitled Spanish movie by the director of Timecrimes or something that it would be heralded as a cult classic. I love Hitchcock, Kubrick, Coens, Billy Wilder, Tarkovsky, Kieslowski, Lynch, even Wild Strawberries - but Pain and Gain somehow became my favorite movie. 

Here's why I love it:

**Its brilliantly satirical.** The writers took a fascinating true-story and recognised its potential for a piss-take of the American dream. How greed, selfishness, stupidity, pride and excessive indulgence all became entwined. In classical style, the script structure mirrors a lifetime - the young, early days of yearning/scheming, the flabby indulgent middle age where emptiness and desperation kick in, the inevitable fall where it all gets taken away. The references to pop-culture ("the greatest men were self-made; Rocky, Scarface, The Godfather", the stripper basing her plan on Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman), the toxic values of the self-help industry (Johnny Wu standing in for Tony Robbins), the liberties taken with the story - it all adds to the fun of the satire. After all their incarcerations and the final edits of what happened, the voiceover of "that's the American dream baby" before the credits hit seals the deal. 

The **color saturation, photography, editing** perfectly match the story, tone, energy and satire. Its why I think Michael Bay was the perfect choice to direct. It never gets boring on re-watches. Its shot and edited so tightly, with a ferocious energy that really makes the most of the medium. The use of different cameras and styles with kinetic editing reminds me of what Oliver Stone was going for with U-Turn, but Pain and Gain works so much better. 

**The soundtrack is brilliant.** I've listened to it a lot as standalone music whilst swimming in Portugal, and hearing it in the film anchors me right back to those awesome summer vibes. The use of non-score songs like Gangsta's Paradise also fit the film perfectly. It needs to be seen/heard on a good system for sure, to do justice to the film.  

There are so many other great touches throughout - Ed Harris's reflective narration about life to anchor the overblown satire to some grounding (with an excellent bit of score - [Du Bois](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFs4MJWLfeM)), the toe-shooting sequence, the Rock's acting of being high, the scenes shot in Bay's own house, Tony Shalhoub's performance.  

**TL:DR; Pain and Gain is better than you think, and you should re-watch it on a good system.**

<TEXT> I've quite enjoyed replaying games in the past (e.g Max Payne, Portal, Limbo, I'm not much of a gamer). The first play through of TLOU two years ago was a great and novel experience.   

Recently I played through again on PS4, but found it underwhelming, to the extent that it tarnished my memory of the first playthrough. Yes, the graphics are gorgeous, but once you adapt the playability then becomes the important factor, and this is where I felt it lacking. 

The only bits I really enjoyed are the action bits that involve choices, strategising a route through a room to get the bad guys with stealth kills. The rest of it was just linear - ladders, pallets, generators, doors, walking, more walking, cut-scenes, exploring everywhere for annoying extras/ammo. Even the story this time felt cliched - there are a few interesting moments (e.g. the end) but mostly its "oh here's a character - get used to them - now they're changing in some way! Surprise!"   

So yeah, I would be interested to hear if others have replayed it a lot and what your experiences are?    </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw this awesome Don Siegel (Dirty Harry, Invasion of Body Snatchers) movie over the weekend, and couldn't believe I hadn't heard of it before.   

Walter Mattau playing the Tommy-Lee Jones of his day is a bank robber, helped by Andy Robinson (the bad guy from Dirty Harry, also in Hellraiser). I won't ruin anything, but it was clearly obvious that Tarantino loves this film, and you even get to hear the original delivery of "get to work on you with some pliers and a blowtorch". Its an intelligent film with great characters (Joe Don Baker is awesome) and a fun, fast-moving story. Bits of it also reminded me of Fargo Season 2. The picture quality on bluray is amazing, the cinematography is interesting too.   

I enjoyed it far, far more than most modern films I've seen recently.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> BoboVR Z4 - Headphone jack issue for bottom-jack phones (e.g. LG G3, G4) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-26 10:04:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This has been briefly touched on in [other](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleCardboard/comments/4g9lam/bobovr_z4_and_lg_g3_rotate_screen/) threads but I thought it would be useful to draw more attention to it. 

If you've ordered/thinking of buying a BoboVR Z4, and your headphone jack is on the bottom (e.g. LG G3, LG G4, I'm sure a few others), then the headphone jack won't extend to the other side.  

Some say "doesn't matter, most apps rotate the screen anyway" but its too annoying, e.g:  
Cmoar cinema: (and I'm sure most other cinema apps) doesn't preserve the correct 3D once its flipped, also the tracking is completely affected, often horizontal motion completely freezes.  
Hardcode: controls are reversed  
QVR: doesn't flip at all  
Zombies and Aliens: you're now on the underside of your gun, like a badass mini-me   

There is about 2 inches of cable inside the headset, so frustrating that they didn't think to make this longer.  
 
I bought an [extender](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/2x-3-5mm-Male-to-Female-Stereo-Audio-Extension-Extender-Cable-Cord-for-Headphone-/381492695551), but whilst waiting for it to arrive I've realised that the volume control and mic functionality will be lost, and Amazon reviews of these short extenders are dreadful in terms of crackly sound.   

I don't fancy re-soldering to the mic board as its tiny, but something I might try is cutting the cable near the mic board, soldering/twisting/wrapping as many leads as I need to extend the cable as much as I need to, then carefully fixing the dodgier section of cable along the underside of the front panel so that the decent end is free to be connected to the right side.  

If any one else with this problem tackles it effectively, would be keen to hear!

<TITLE> Z4 finally arrived, can compare to Fiit/LeNest (also, thoughts) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-25 12:12:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **First impressions of Z4** - really impressive. Comfortable, nice big bright and clear image quality. I used Ceder Falls Coaster as a tester, and it looked great. The adjustment dials (moving the phone forward and backwards and lens width for IPD) are GREAT for quickly getting that nice sharp image. The image is almost *too* sharp - watching a high bitrate rip of Bladerunner in Cmoar, I could notice the artifacts/colour palette reduction of the app's image processing.  

**Sound** - I wasn't as disappointed by the sound as I was prepared to be. I think its fine - but there is a caveat. The headphones sound A LOT better if you push them onto your ears more. On the Cedar Falls Coaster, you could then hear the bassy thunder of the coaster. In Cmoar cinema, it made the sound "truer", the bass notes filling the screen more. Without pushing the phones in to your ears, it sounds tinnier and the bass notes are lost. This difference will probably create a hugely varied difference of opinion in people based on whether they push them in more or not. I really think the headstrap should have been on the *other side* (i.e. outer side) of the headphone arms - so that they naturally push them into your ears. I'm going to have to take it apart to switch them around. Other than that, I love the convenience of the headphones, and the weight/balancing on the head is great.  **Edit: fixed them**. Using assistance from /u/VRKommando's [mod tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EeqAWxX1nI), [I fixed the straps to the other side](http://imgur.com/a/YfFeq). Sound quality is loads better.   

**Compared to Fiit**   

Comfort wise, Z4 wins so much. The face surround (for me) lets in no light, whereas it does a bit with Fiit. The convenience of the adjustments on Z4 is great. With Fiit, I *hate* the individually adjustable lenses, they're a pain in the ass. You have to remove the thing to get at them. If you wipe mist in that first 10 mins of settling into a movie, you inadvertently twist them round until they're imbalanced, and I've had them fall out a few times as well. The comfort of the lenses themselves is also much better on the Z4 - they don't touch my face at all. With Fiit, the big ridges around the lenses (where you adjust them) dig into the underside of my brow and it bugs the hell out of me. Z4 is really nice and comfortable.   

**FOV/image.** I set up Perfect Beach to compare image size, area etc. The overall image size of Z4 seems about 20-30% bigger than Fiit, its definitely an improvement. BUT - the actual area of 3D is about the same, and this has consequences. The image in the Z4 is like a Venn diagram (two circles overlapping), so a chunk of the image on each side is only seen by one eye. I would say its about 60% in the middle is 3D, with 20% on each side 2D (maybe even 50/25/25). When you're looking dead center, its not a problem, everything on your fovea looks fine and your peripheral vision doesn't pick up the 2D on the sides. But if you look around a bit, its noticeable. With the Fiit, the image is smaller, but more wholly 3D (better overlap). So I'm not sure what to make of that. If you were watching a film where the image was fixed (e.g. to prevent drift, lying in bed or whatever) then the outer sections of the frame would only be visible to one eye. If it was a 3D film, then it could ruin the immersion. In Cmoar cinema, I loaded a 3D film and found it felt better with 120 set in the FOV settings, to make the screen smaller. But, it was still loads better in the Z4 having a bigger overall image for the sense of immersion. The Fiit in comparison felt like looking down a looroll. NB: I set QR codes/adjustments right for the comparisons. 

**Headphone jack issue on Z4** - the headphone jack can't stretch to the other side of the phone. Most apps flip the screen accordingly so its all good, but I know a few are fixed, so on an LG G4 or any phone where the jack is at the bottom of your phone, there could be a problem there and you might need to get an extender at some point. Cmoar cinema for example, if watching a 3D film and you flip your phone so the top of the phone is on the right hand side, then the 3D of the film gets inverted. So yeah, its an issue. **Fix**: [This](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/2x-3-5mm-Male-to-Female-Stereo-Audio-Extension-Extender-Cable-Cord-for-Headphone-/381492695551) should hopefully do the trick (when they finally arrive). 

**TL:DR;** Z4 way more comfortable, excellent adjustments. Sound is fine *if* you push the phones in more, you should purchase a headphone extender if your headphone jack is on the bottom of your phone. Nice FOV, but compromised 3D area, hopefully not too much of an issue.    </TEXT>

Yesterday I emailed the company to ask why its late - I paid an extra $10 for 5-10 shipping. They said to wait, be patient etc. Then, miraculously a few hours later, the shipping is updated to say its left the sorting office... *but hasn't left China yet.* Really fucking frustrating!  

How are you guys getting on with your orders?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> So first they revealed The Big Short with an explanation of the first clue in its email.  

Then they email out Midnight Special in the title of their reminder email. They say its a "glitch with the email" and that it won't happen again.   

So the very next time - they do the exact same thing, putting the film in the title of their reminder email.  

Seriously, how fucking stupid are they. Its one thing to make a mistake, its another to specifically say you won't make the mistake again, then do that same thing at the next opportunity.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've noticed the Google Play store games tend to be pretty shoddy - single levels, unfinished, full of ads etc. E.g Go4d has great potential, but is just a single short level. Hardcode is pretty good. Some of the zombie shooters are ok.  

I only discovered DVR and QVR (the Doom and Quake ports by DrBeef) via an old thread - they don't tend to show up in searches for VR, Cardboard or 3D. Are there any other good games that are hard to find? Or maybe available elsewhere from the Play store?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the thing - ScreenUnseen is a brilliant idea. Its fun, the films are (mostly) great, and I LOVE that bit of excitement just before the cert screen where you're thinking "whatsitgonnabe?" I also like the shared experience of other people showing up for it, its like you're all in this experience together. Its nice when people chat about it afterwards, you don't normally get that after seeing a film. Basically, its like a big film club for film fans, and kudos to Odeon for having the balls to do something different. 

YET...

They completely screw it up by having the most incompetent schmucks in their marketing department, spoiling the last one and the next one. 

This contradiction is perfectly encapsulated by their in-screen branding. When you get into the theatre, you see this huge O on the screen, blue swirling background, it looks cool and exciting. Then you get the clip where some juvenile, self-conscious idiotic ass-hat says "now its time for the trailers - ah - the trailers - my favourite bit!" and then the clip about switching off phones and not talking "yeah, that includes you two in the middle!" His voice is so pathetic it carries all the persuasive power of a perturbed ant.

<TITLE> First VR experience - using LeNest (Fiit)   LG G4 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-31 10:06:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I researched for days, eventually settling on the LeNest (aka Fiit) based on u/MariaKorolov's review [here](http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2016/03/review-lenest-viewer-is-close-to-perfect/). I've ordered a Z4 too from alibaba.  

I'm using an LG G4, and it fits in perfectly in the holder bit. I have a QuickCircle case on my phone, and it works fine to bend the case around to the back - it still cushions in perfectly. I used the QR code for Freefly as per MK's recommendation. 

Thoughts - the FOV isn't quite the immersion I was hoping for, so I hope the 120 promised by Z4 is better. I can see the square shape of the screen in front of me, some of the surrounding internals of the device, and even light between the cushioning pads between my face and device. I have quite a deep brow, and something that doesn't get mentioned much in reviews is how individual face shape effects the experience. The face comfort for LeNest isn't great - its thin foam, and the material between the strip of foam and the plastic device is translucent. This means I have to hold my hands around the gaps to get darkness (until I mod it at least). Also, the plastic upper ridge really digs into my forehead as I try to push it on tight enough to close out the side light.  

I've unscrewed the eye lenses as far as they'll go before falling out, to ensure they're as close to my eyes as possible. The image is really clear - I was really impressed and expected it to be far more pixelated.  

The IPD adjustment is essential to get a comfortable view - I know the Freefly lacks this, so I'm glad I didn't go for that. 
 
Also - I found it essential to get easy access to my phone (again the Freefly is apparently a nightmare for this). Most apps are pretty short, and even gimmicky videos (e.g. on VRSE) lose their novelty after a while. I was constantly taking the phone out to try new things.    

From the things I've tried so far, I loved the Cedar Point and Blockbuster rollercoasters, Titans of Space was pretty cool too. I'm waiting on a controller so I can get stuck into games. 

**EDIT - since using more, I've discovered a fatal flaw of this device for me.** I have a brow which is just above my eyes (I'm not being funny, but it really is *just* above my eyes). When pushing my face into this thing, it really hurts on my brow. I thought it was the plastic ridge on the top of the device, which I could perhaps mod in some way. But its actually the 5mm or so ridge around the lenses. Because they're adjustable, the adjustable bit sits around the lens - but means the overall diameter is much bigger than the actual lens itself. This is really annoying. I've looked at pics of the Z4 and see there isn't much beyond the width of the lens. So I'm hoping the Z4 will be much more comfortable. To fit under my brow, I was moving the lenses too low on the LeNest which was making the vision blurry (you have to look dead center through the lenses for a clear image).    </TEXT>

One thing that I'm unsure of is the sound. I'm using a LG G4 - I'm not too experienced or knowledgeable about sound quality on these things. Should I re-acquire my film files in stereo sound because 5.1 is a waste of space? Or is there a way to make the best use of surround sound?

<TEXT> #1: Johnny 5, with Michael McKeen on his back, somehow descends down a sewer manhole. There is no explanation of this, how his big tank style feet are able to use a ladder or even slowly descend into a hole. He then ascends repeatedly at various other manhole covers to keep tabs on the car he is chasing. The implication is that he is quickly rolling down sewers to get around NYC, but there is no shit anywhere on his wheel things, not a single fleck on either of them. The real thing about this whole sewer business that confuses me is that he's able to lift an *entire car, with three men inside,* from a manhole. I have no idea what he's standing on, or how he's able to do that, or how he's able to spin the car around like he does.   

#2: At the end, Johnny 5 swings across a river, to grab a fat man on a moving speedboat. The combined weight of a very heavy robot, and a fat man, are held by a *rubber sucker stuck to a rusty crane hook*, that Johnny 5 shot out from about 50m away.  </TEXT>

======================================================


Even though their contexts couldn't be further apart. Here's what the films share in common (mainly structural):  

An initial scene to introduce the characters and establish the context.  

We'll be shown lots of long takes throughout with impressive choreography/design/VFX to orient us to the context. 

A pivot point (impressive VFX, talking point) which leads the protagonist to be cut off, and to all intents and purposes "left for dead".

Person they were with dies soon after.  

Protagonist then overcomes a number of obstacles to survive. Each one slightly different, taking them closer to the hope of their goal.  

Protagonist faces death but chooses to fight in, because of thoughts of their child.  

Protagonist sees a vision of the person who died earlier, which inspires more drive. 

Protagonist ends up in water, eventually reaches their goal, survives. 

Ends with a kind of "what now" moment, leaving the audience to contemplate their own journey in life.

<TITLE> Review of a stage hypnosis show, wasn't great </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-30 13:57:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I went to stage hypnosis show this weekend. The hypnotist is very renowned, but his performance was pretty bad. I thought I'd write about it so others could learn from it. Here are the main things:  

- He didn't project belief that he could/would hypnotise anyone. The audience was fairly small, and it seemed to really knock his confidence (despite being one of the most authored/reputable hypnotists). This negative suggestion of the evening probably not going to go well really didn't help.   

- Very negative rapport. Most of the bad jokes were aimed at audience members. It didn't help with trust, rapport or prestige.   

- The suggestibility tests were delivered poorly - no persuasive, commanding voice or expectancy, just complacency.  

- Despite not responding great to the tests, I volunteered to go on stage. Surprisingly, we were given a progressive relaxation induction, which bugged me because there was too much time/opportunity for my own thoughts/awareness to counteract the response.  

- Went straight from "assumed" hypnosis into giving post-hypnotic commands to sleep, and trying to elicit phenomena (laughing at a funny film). I found it hugely awkward and uncomfortable.   

- When he said sleep, I closed my eyes and bowed my head, but only to save him from being embarrassed/being awkward/evoking some kind of mocking response from him (I didn't particularly trust him). I still lifted the "heavy" object though and didn't laugh at the imagined comedy film, because I really didn't want to play along to that extent.   

- The only person on stage (out of three) who responded was a previous trainee of the hypnotist, who was also a friend. Her reaction was very overblown and sycophantic, didn't have any of the naturalism/genuineness that I have seen in real hypnotic subjects before.  

- Because I wasn't responding well, I was told I wasn't very good at imagining, which really bugged me and dissuaded me from playing along from that point on. I'm very good at imagining, I was just too aware of all the negative suggestions and implications this guy was offering.   

- Before the hypnosis bit, he did some really lame mentalism tricks to "prove" various psychological things (lie detection, by pretending to read body language in guessing a card he'd forced to someone, so lame, and ideo-motor movements with another forced choice trick, again very lame). I was on stage at this bit too and had to pretend to be impressed by his supposed lie-detection/body reading/ideo-motor sensitivity when it was clearly all bullshit. This bugged me because actual hypnosis is fascinating enough with its implications that you shouldn't need to resort to lame nonsense to trick the audience.  

- Afterwards he tried to console the audience by framing the evening as "just entertainment" and that if we had a few laughs that was good enough. I found that pretty lame, and I expected far more from it.  

- I came away from the evening believing that the hypnotist (who again, is very renowned/published/known) didn't really understand about hypnosis or feel particularly confident about using it, didn't know how to relate to an audience, and didn't know enough about psychology to deliver something genuinely interesting rather than pseudo-tripe.  

- I kept quiet about my (extensive) knowledge/experience of hypnosis. In the bar afterwards, I listened to a fair few excruciatingly dull/egotistic anecdotes/claims of some hypnotherapists/hypnotists in the audience. I came to think that despite it being a fascinating subject, most self-proclaimed hypnotists are in desperate need of approval and prone to massive egos. It was oddly disturbing, and made me feel awkward/embarrassed about how the hypnosis industry must look to outsiders (tacky, egotistical, self-obsessed). 

Am open to questions if you have any.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Regression (2015) with Ethan Hawke   Emma Watson is shockingly bad </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-10 13:51:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I saw **Regression** last night which for some reason isn't released in the US until next February. 

Its one of those films that ends with a complete anti-climax, where the whole story and point of the film cancels itself out in a moment of complete stupidity. I want to explain the basic story structure, because its *so* shockingly bad and stupid, so mild spoilers follow. 

Ethan Hawke (playing his usual character) is a cop investigating a girl (Watson, pretty good performance) who claims to have been abused by her dad as part of some weird ritual, who accepts it but can't remember doing it. He's balding, so you know, he must be a bad guy. 

Hawke gets a lame, generic psychologist (a complete waste of David Thewlis) to do a regression on the dad, with the worse example of hypnosis/regression you'll ever see in a film. The dad then "remembers" a bunch of other stuff including a cop. Watson has seen the cop before too, so points him out among some photos. So Hawke promptly arrests the cop because he has no actual understanding of what police-work involves or what evidence is. 

They then do a regression on the dad's other son, and he comes up with a bunch of other stuff. Hawke talks to a few other people, and gets nowhere fast. 

The bulk of the film is then Hawke getting paranoid, and having bad dreams, which are just an excuse to have the films ONLY scare scenes. Literally all just dreams, how lame is that? They're cheap and unscary too. He dreams about some scary lady who he later learns he saw on an advertising billboard. 

Which leads to the climax of the film, because only then does he realise that suggestion is a thing, that people can be influenced by what they see, and that memory is subjective. FUCK KNOWS why it took him this long to realise. He goes back to Emma Watson, and tells her a bunch of stuff that someone else said happened to her. She agrees with it all, and cries. He's been reading from his notepad - which he throws down and * gasp * its blank! He was just making it up! Which means *she* was just making it up! He then suggests that yes, evil *does* exist, implying that its her. Because you know, telling lies is evil. 

**So the basic story is *a girl makes up a rape tale, then milks it for a while, until a cop calls her out on it*.** In the meantime, because he's such a shitty, shitty cop who can't tell the difference between rumor and actual fact, he gets all paranoid and has bad dreams about 80's special-effects.

The film then has a horrible title-card saying how no satanic ritual cases were ever proved, and how regression was discredited. 

*What?* 

Its like saying "body language was never used to prove someone is guilty, so it was discredited". Its the most obvious, pointless conclusion! You've literally just shown me a film about how rumor, hearsay and biased memory aren't FACTS, and made out like its some big revelation. 

But there are three things which are worse than that. 

Firstly, it doesn't define regression. Its essentially just "remembering" something that was previously difficult to remember (e.g. because of an emotional barrier of some kind). So making a film to attack the idea of regression per se, is just flimsy and stupid. 

Second is that regression can be useful, in some contexts, e.g. unlocking repressed memories etc. Of course it shouldn't be used in court, or as evidence, but that doesn't mean it can't still be useful. In the same way Cal Lightman uses body language in Lie To Me for example, it can point to other things that *may* have more evidence. People *have* for example uncovered repressed memories that had details later corroborated by evidence. 

Thirdly, because something like regression doesn't necessarily prove something happened, it doesn't prove it didn't happen either. The film completely ignores this idea, suggesting that because none of the reports of ritualistic abuse were ever proved, they therefore didn't happen - they must have been the product of rumor and suggestibility. *What the fuck?* 

**TL,DR: Its misjudged, imbalanced, stupid and not scary.**

I just enjoy watching these kinds of films where its like you go on an adventure with the protagonist. 

Films like Blue Ruin or cop films wouldn't count for example, because the film already takes place in the context of the story that unfolds. I want examples where the beginning is largely unrelated to what follows.  </TEXT>

I recently bought this car, one year old. There was a rattle on the bottom. I discovered a loose heat-shield. 

This led to a further discovery that the exhaust was dented.

My question is - could the inability for emissions to fully escape cause harm to the engine? Its done 9000 miles, and its possible that the dent has been there from the beginning (if a transporter for eg). 

Thank you!

PS the garage is aware of it and will rectify, my question is more about any other long term consequences to the engine.  </TEXT>

Edit: (added) Fight Club, Shawshank, Rush, The Prestige, Sleuth, Moon, Two Faces of January, In Bruges

I wouldnt really include films like Lethal Weapon, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Crimson Tide, Usual Suspects (for the Chazz/Spacey dynamic) as the relationships in those movies arguably don't really form the focus of the films compellingness.

<TEXT> I saw this intriguing little horror movie last night. Its the latest in the wave of 80s inspired movies (Drive, Cold In July, The Guest, The Way Way Back) complete with a John Carpenter style synth soundtrack.  

The story is about a curse whereby a person is followed continuously by a murderous walking ghost (which can look like anyone) until they're dead - *unless* the person sleeps with someone else, in which case they pass the curse on.  If that person gets killed though, the follower goes back to the previous person. It basically channels that relentless menace of the Terminator, mixed with that creepy old man in the black hat from that Poltergeist sequel. 

Some of the scenes genuinely scared the hell out of me, perfectly capturing that eerie what-the-fuckness that you crave from a decent horror (even more so than The Babadook managed last year).   </TEXT>

<TITLE> How could a major film like Taken 3 have such poor editing? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-28 12:13:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Anyone who has seen Taken 3 will surely notice how awful the editing is. Shots sometimes last only a few frames, and a simple shot of Neeson jumping over a fence has about 30 shaky cuts from all angles. Every single action scene is shot and edited so poorly that you have absolutely no idea of space or motion. 

Then there are strange moments like when twice, a car explodes with Neeson in it, then moments later he is somewhere else. 

My perception is that the film industry is highly competitive, with technical roles hugely sought after by highly talented and dedicated people. Taken 3 is honestly worse than The Room in the editing stakes - its worse than a student project. Its *terrible*. I just don't understand how something like that could happen? How could its rough cuts make it through production screenings?   

I've honestly never been so confused by the poor quality of a major release (I'm not even talking about the writing, cinematography or directing here).  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [TOMT][FILM] Old suspense movie that starts with someone hanging from a tree </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> About 25 years ago I sat with my parents to watch a film on tv, that film was cancelled and in its place was some other film. We sat and watched it anyway, and it turned out to be really suspenseful and memorable. I just can't remember what it was called, and trying to track it down is proving really difficult. 

Here's what I can remember: the opening scenes show someone's feet hanging from a tree. Its eerie and mysterious. A story develops that I think takes place in an empty school over summer. I think there are only a fee people involved, but it ends with some threatening character chasing another through the school - the chasee hiding in various places. I found it pretty scary. Somehow it ends with the surviving character (I think) hanging himself or herself from a tree near the building, and we return again to the opening scene. 

I would love it if someone could recognise this movie! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Almost every film recently has had noisy idiots who either underestimate how far their voices/whispers travel (quieter screenings), don't even notice they're vocally responding to things on screen (any kind of screening), or are just flat out rude. I hate it when someone assumes everyone wants to hear their wisecrack, as if the film experience will be better with their commentary.  

Then there are the people who laugh at anything they perceive as comedy, even if contextually its only supposed to convey a character's nervousness or something. Something is meant as dark sarcasm, and an idiot guffaws to let everyone else around know they got the joke. 

Then there are idiots who go on their phones, and you can see the bright screens popping up a few rows in front whilst they update FB about whats happening in the movie. 

I fucking *hate* the risk of morons being at the cinema. They distract and fuck up my first time viewing of what could be an lifetime favourite or important movie.

<TITLE> How does the xenomorph in Alien (1979) grow so big in an hour? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-02 11:48:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After the chestburster runs off, its not long until the crew reconvene to go looking for it. I'm guessing its about 45 minutes, maybe less, that Brett goes looking for the cat. By then, the chestburster is bigger than a man, fully developed, fully coordinated. There's no inbetween. How is this possible? Further, how the hell did he make enough alien-resin stuff to paste a whole couple of walls in the directors cut, in such a short space of time? As far as I can tell, there's only an hour or so between the chestburster scene and Ripley discovering it. Its not like they ever say "ok, enough hunting, I'm going to take a bath and read a book, let's carry on tomorrow".  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Something missing a bit from the game (spoilers) </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When Ricado(?) had the facehugger on his face, I was fully expecting him to show up later in the game, coughing etc, so we could see a chestburster. Then it dawned on me that whilst they've crammed in a lot of the alien lore, we don't actually get to see the full life-cycle. A really fun thing would have been if it all began with an egg in the part of the ship that Amanda arrives at, then a facehugger on a crewmember, then seeing the alien tiny - then as the game progresses, it gets bigger and bigger until the full size monster that takes up the rest of the game. Maybe it would have been a little too close to Alien that way, but that wouldn't have necessarily been a bad thing taking into account all the other similarities? The alien as it was felt a bit like a secondary thing in the game, after the relentless and plentiful androids (also that it didn't have a satisfying death).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wish they hadn't followed this trend - I feel that they remove you from the atmosphere by reminding you "hey, its a game that people have made who have built all these little mechanics in, and now they're trying to teach you about them".  

Sometimes the tips refer to androids, other times synthetics, they give many tips about the alien before you even see it which ruins the suspense and surprise, they often contradict ("running is a last resort / run whenever you can"), and they ruin the sense of discovery of things (why tell you that people might be hostile or friendly? surely its more fun to discover that yourself).  

I'd have personally preferred just seeing the ominous fuzzy vhs shots of the ship with the wind sounds, it works perfectly as a primer for the atmosphere that follows.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Roger Dodger (2002) is like a prequel to The Social Network </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-27 14:33:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Roger Dodger (2002)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0299117/) is about a washed-up player (Campbell Scott on top form) showing his younger 16 yr old nephew how to flirt and score with women. Its witty, subtle, understated and great fun to watch.  

Jesse Eisenberg plays the nephew - who looks and sounds exactly like his performance of Zuckerberg a few years later in The Social Network. He even wears a blue hoodie over a grey t-shirt. 

[Jesse Eisenberg in Roger Dodger](http://i1.cdnds.net/14/05/618x430/movies-roger-dodger-jesse-eisenberg.jpg)

In Roger Dodger, his character wants to go into computer programming, is a virgin, and is very socially awkward with girls.  

It leads perfectly to his performance in Social Network. 

...all this obviously ignores Social Network being based on a true story.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mainly, the assassination attempts on Bond's life are ridiculously elaborate, and ALL FAIL:

Jaws pushes Bond out of a plane. 

Centrifuge - Bond is sped up to 12G until he miraculously fires a wrist-dart into the right control panel to disable it. 

Man up tree clumsily aiming at Bond. Could have just walked nearby then shot him?

"Corpse" in a funeral boat in Venice opens the coffin and throws knives - gets stabbed by Bond. Ridiculously elaborate, could have just stabbed him off the boat. 

Crappy Korean martial arts guy follows Bond to Venice and tries to bust him up in a museum, fails miserably. 

Jaws follows Bond to Rio, and plots with a bald man to tamper with his cable car. He then jumps onto his cable car to "do him in". Pretty damn risky if you ask me. Fails.

Jaws et al chase Bond in boats down an Amazonian river. Fails, falls down huge waterfall (but manages to get to the base in a few minutes intact whilst Bond has to glide for a while). 

Drax has Bond wrestle with some beastly Amazonian water snake under water (Bond happened to be standing on the wrong rock, which was designed to tip into the water, clumsy Bond. Bond stabs snake with poison pen he stole from CIA girl, that didn't fall out of his loose shirt pocket whilst gliding or struggling underwater). 

Drax puts Bond and girl into a meeting room which also doubles up as a fire chamber for a rocket launch. Pretty dangerous meeting room, but at least it has a large escapable air vent. 

Drax later attempts to put Bond and girl into airlock on the space-station, but a fight happens instead. 

When a gun is *finally put to Bond's head*, he manages to switch off the gravity inside the station and gets away. 



I'm also slightly confused by how Drax managed to build a huge multiple spaceshuttle launching space-facility inside a rock in the Amazon jungle, as well as a huge centrifugal space-station above the earth. WITHOUT ANYONE KNOWING.

<TITLE> Why didn't Predator kill the cabinet minister's crew? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-16 16:45:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So Predator killed Jim Hopper, the first guy that went in to do the mission. Then it skinned the first rescue team. So it was pretty active in that area, for a decent while. So why did it not touch the little bad-guy village, despite them executing people and sitting around with weapons? It would have been more appropriate if by the time Dutch and co reached them, they were all already slaughtered and/or missing (but then the film would be one nice action scene less).

<TEXT> I thought Upstream Color was an incredible achievement - in writing, direction, cinematography, editing, acting and even the soundtrack is amazing (much better than Gravity's imo).

The story itself was fascinating - exploring themes such as slavery, control, life-cycles, connection, love, loss, meaning, voyeurism, memory and sensory perception.   

Really, its an incredible movie, and an outstanding cinematic achievement. 

I have no idea why it wasn't nominated for anything. People like Shane Carruth should surely be commended for their originality and daring, not snubbed. 

I just have a feeling that it went way over the academy's heads. </TEXT>

But there are always lots of other players with huge guns, firing rockets from their cars and blowing me up all the time. Sometimes I seem to get chased and bullied because its obvious I'm a newbie. I accidentally found a players apartment who let me in, who had a garage filled with chrome supercars. How on earth do people get to this level?

<TITLE> Where you sit in the cinema, and when, are big variables on the experience of a film - do you factor this in? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-11-27 14:29:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Two variables I've noticed that make a massive difference on the experience of a film (found through watching some films 2 or 3 times at the cinema):  

- **How far you sit from the screen** - the screen can be HUGE sat close, or tiny from the back. Huge difference in how engaged and immersed you'll be in the film! With something like **Gravity** its best to sit close (where 3D is also enhanced due to wider parallax), whilst something like **Captain Phillips** (or shaky-cam movies) is best to sit further back to absorb the image easier. I honestly think that people who watched Gravity from the back of the theater would have had a completely different experience to those sat closer to the front. But, if the screen doesn't have tiered seating, then sitting too close can also distort the image (keystone effect, which also happens if you sit on the very edge) which harms the ability to engage with the film.  

- **Packed screening or just a few people**: makes a huge difference on atmosphere and distraction levels. Strangely, I've found noise levels to be much worse in a fewer-populated screening than when its packed. I think people underestimate how far their voices/whispers travel when there are few people, so they're more likely to talk. Whilst in a packed screen, there is more a group pressure to be quiet, and also more people around to tell people to shut up. I've found packed (e.g. opening weekends) to be quieter than smaller screenings a few weeks later. I also found that bigger audiences gives a much better atmosphere, like its more of a shared experience. All the people I know who loved **The Worlds End** (myself included) watched it in busy screens, the people I know who didn't think much of it watched it in quiet screens. 

I know this probably seems obvious, but maybe not for all. I do think these variables can affect the experience of a film so much, I'm surprised they're not taken into account more when people are discussing differences in perception of recent movies.

<TEXT> Frequently, when Indy is in some secret place, the way out is far, far simpler than the way in.  

- Raiders: After all the effort it takes to get into the chamber of the idol, the way out is a big corridor with a large exit next to some trees where Belloq and the natives are waiting. If the exit was so obvious, why hadn't anyone *ever* gone in there, and already tripped the big ball?  

- Raiders: Who knew, that next to a small airfield, if a large block was pulled out from a wall, behind it would be the Ark of the Covenant? Again, great pains to find the secret chamber, has to prize open a "lid" to the place, but then is able to push a brick out to easily get out.   

- Last Crusade: Secret tomb is hidden under a converted church/library. Right next to the tomb, with barely any exploration at all, Indy says "I've found a way" then they pop up out of an easily removable *manhole cover* in the middle of a outdoor square. So no one has been down that easily removable manhole cover, where they would have quickly discovered the not-very-well-hidden tomb.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw 12 Angry Men again last night and really enjoyed it, each time I notice more nuances and observations about human nature. It seems to effortlessly portray many modes of influence, conformity, prejudice, socialisation, anxiety, aging, various biases, hypocrisy, influence of upbringing, ignorance, emotional repression, leadership, the class system. Its like a masterclass in the human condition. I can't think of another film that achieves this as well as 12 Angry Men, but would love to hear any recommendations.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> A few questions about Season 8 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-06 10:08:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Where is Harry? As a visual metophor of Dexter's conscience it was a really effective way of allowing his reflective thoughts and themes to layer out the episodes. I'm not sure why they got rid of that. He'd have surely talked Dexter out of his ludicrous, out of character decision to not kill Zack - which I can't accept no matter how hard I try. Based on all that has happened to him (his various doomed liaisons with *anyone*, especially after letting Hannah go) it seems like a huge insult to the audience, as well as all his past kills, to not have him follow through. All because Vogel suggested it? Again, after all he's been through, this makes his character dorkier than ever and I'm sure most of the audience facepalmed at that moment.     

The role of Vogel - what is this all about? First she's helping Miami Met catch a killer. This is then dropped and she becomes a target instead. Then she turns out to be Dex's kind-of surrogate mother. Then she blackmails Dex into finding her killer, which he does. Then Zack's dad *randomly calls her up to talk to his son because he thinks his son might be a psychopath?* I honestly can't think of a more forced plot contrivance ever in Dexter! Even Dex doesn't seem phased by the sheer coincidence of it.  

I feel like this season has already almost "reset" after six pointless episodes - there's no accumulative build up of tension at all. I feel pretty angry at the writers - fans deserve better.

<TITLE> Do you think modern movies are making less use of our imaginations? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-18 22:30:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Some of my favourite moments from films are where my own imagination becomes the stimuli for the incredible excitement and suspense that the unconscious mind can generate. Examples (for me):

- the vibrations of the T-Rex in Jurassic Park, the water in the cup
- The AT-ATs in Empire Strikes Back, creeping over the horizon through binoculars
- Newt and Ripley in Aliens waking in a locked room with overturned Facehugger canisters
- Finding the first shed skin of the xenomorph in Alien
- Pans Labyrinth where the girl sees the horrific drawings of kids being slaughtered by the monster, then it suddenly wakes at the table 

Recently having seen Star Trek Into Darkness, Man of Steel, World War Z and Pacific Rim at cinemas, it dawned on me that I can't think of a single memorable moment in any of them like these where my imagination was stimulated in interesting ways. I don't think I got any of that mind-magic because everything was up there on the screen. 

Its like all the effects and CGI are replacing the need for an imagination. I'm not saying I'm right, its just a subjective observation, so wondered what you guys thought (and whether I missed something).  

Also - feel free to add your own favourite imagination-moments in movies! </TEXT>
