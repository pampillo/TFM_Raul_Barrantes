<TEXT> They are hoping to create the perception of widespread anger and unrest, which then makes a lot of on-lookers and media viewers and readers think, "There's a lot of problems in our society, we need change!" And that instability is a valuable initial step to bringing in some sort of change against whatever is around now. But the question is, how exactly did this new protest get organized around the world and agree on their messaging, slogans, methods, and tactics so quickly? Is it being funding and directing by others behind the scenes, or is it really mostly spontaneous?    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely! Imagine uncovering a 36-year-old safe, and breaking it open only to find nothing more than a few hundred dollars in *cash?* Some might wonder: Who the hell would only say a few hundred dollars in a safe? 

Well, $500 in January 1981 = $1,401 in March 2017.

And $500 in March 2017 = $178 in January 1981. 

(180% down in value one way, 64% up the other way)

(Yes, the official inflation calculator now includes months!)

<TITLE> The Dow Jones-Silver ratio back in 1981 was 50/1, meaning: 50 oz. of silver would buy the Dow Jones Index 36 years ago. Today, the ratio is trading above 1,200/1. Thus, the ratio is nearly 25 times higher today than it was in 1981. (Note: the article mistakenly says "46 years ago," not 36.) </TITLE>

<TEXT>  ***Lysistrata*** is a comedy by Aristophanes. Originally performed in classical Athens in 411 BCE, it is a comic account of a woman's extraordinary mission to end the Peloponnesian War by denying all the men of the land any sex, which was the only thing they truly and deeply desired. Lysistrata persuades the women of Greece to withhold sexual privileges from their husbands and lovers as a means of forcing the men to negotiate peacea strategy, however, that inflames the battle between the sexes. The play is notable for being an early expos of sexual relations in a male-dominated society.

<TEXT> I saw an interview from '79 or '80, I think it was with Dick Cavett, where they were talking about the fact that he was known for just walking around the city all throughout the '70s, just as you see in that footage. I myself live right near Central Park and have seen several famous people jogging or walking with a friend or two, and it's true that NYC is generally okay for famous people to be out and about, unlike LA, where there are swarms of paparazzi everywhere, whether or foot or in cars, but still it's pretty crazy, yeah. One of the sour moments I saw the TV actor Hank Azaria running, and he was drenched in sweat and started walking to catch his breath, and some big fat dude came up next to him with a little notepad and a pen and was begging for an autograph, and Hank Azaria waved him off, and the guy was like "You're a real jerk!" Ridiculous.

<TEXT> ***"Internet culture"*** - I guess that's just the name for the act of TYPING "this is fuckin retarded" or "fuck this shit" under an article, picture, or video, instead of just saying it outloud at what you're seeing on your TV screen, hearing on your car radio, or reading on a newspaper page. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's simply just a matter of more people--and specifically more young males between the ages of 13 and 25--saying more online, and then talking the way they actually do among their siblings, friends, and peers, including peers they don't like or even hate. Do teenage guys curse at each other when they are joking around, or when are playing a video game in the same room, or even playing a game of table tennis or basketball? Do they not regularly get annoyed and pissed off and insult each other, threaten and mock each other, and try to embarrass each other in front of someone else? At frat party or in a car or in a text conversation, do young guys not talk in a way that would appall and offend most females and adults and senior citizens? Did young guys never say things like "You're a fucking idiot, fuck off, your mother's a whore, you're a fag, eat shit and die, go suck a dick" before the first time that Internet forum users began popularly saying "OP is a fag"? And were they not already talking and acting that way in real life, face to face, in the early '90s, and the '80s, and the '70s? 

The difference online is that guys are expressing that familiarity and "comfort" level with total strangers--and the phenomenon has a name: the online disinhibition effect, as explained in the article below--but I really see it as just ongoing bullshit-talking from guys who talk shit; it's not some degradation of human nature at this point in the history of human evolution or society. One factor is that now, nerds are able to talk shit, because everyone is equalized by the fact that all they have is the same means of representing themselves, namely, words on a screen. Wherever there are more guys trying to looks smart, cool, or tough, like on Gaming forums, or on the Bodybuilding.com forum ("Misc.," which now calls itself "legendary" in its tagline), or in U.S. political arguments (where the definition of what it means to be an American man is the underlying matter being debate), the shit-talking frequency and intensity, as are that of the vulgarity, insults, and threats. Verbal abuse typed between people on the screen of their computer or smartphone is a new phenomenon, yes, but verbal abuse and the common activity of guys ragging and ripping on each other--whether they are jokingly making fun or maliciously bullying--was not somehow invented by Something Awful.

<TEXT> I didn't even know it existed until i googled "book shelf porn" and got /r/BookcasePorn and then the much more active /r/BookPorn! Here are other "sfw porn" subreddits, though I think the use of the word "porn" is stupid, as there are many people who'll skip them because of the name alone -

https://www.reddit.com/r/sfwpornnetwork/wiki/network

There are awesome subreddits about so many things; Reddit could do a lot more to promote them, for instance, by featuring like a few every week among the usual default subreddits, but I think the reason they don't is that there are too many big-paying brands and organizations paying to place advertising in the form of images and written propaganda, in the most active subreddits. Hence, /r/HailCorporate! Go through the links in the right margin and see what it's all about here:

If you wanna see some of the new wrestling, one new thing now is "205 Live," where the wrestlers don't weight more than 205 pounds, and there are some very good guys there:

But there was plenty of talking like that more than 10 years ago; here's one example from 2004:

<TEXT> I spent hours putting this together and hopefully you like some of these! This is the Archive page for each, so, to prevent your browser from getting stuck after scrolling too far, just load several months, and then click the next month from the menu at the top so you can continue. Typically, Tumblr blogs have more images in the earlier months, but most of these are still posting a lot. And if you wanna know the source of any image, try searching it with Google Images.

<TEXT>  Are people really counterfeiting 1 pound coins?

Sure, there's a demand. Just imagine being very poor, or even lower-middle class. They aren't throwing pennies away. I mean, what is the highest amount of money you would not bother picking up if you dropped it on the sidewalk while walking alone? Would you bother picking up a penny? What about a dime? A quarter? I live in NYC and an old woman asked me for "two pennies" just last night, April 2, 2017.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, regarding endless wars, earlier in the interview, Stone says that Trump doesn't want to carry out a "regime change" and a war in Syria (as happened in Iraq and Libya), and so far that's true--so far, yes, but Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and Hillary Clinton all spoke out against Syria in their campaigns, and I think they would have ordered a lot more aggression by this point in their administration. Here's what Hillary was saying last July:

<TEXT> Well, you could say even more so that Trump was even deeper into the establishment because he, unlike Stone, was close with Republicans as well as Democrats for decades, and I realize that SOME people see Trump's agenda as just being a continuation of the standard U.S. Republican agenda in all areas, but I think that Trump's campaign was not part of the establishment machine, and that his administration isn't either, as the establishment keeps trying to get rid of him. In fact, Rachel Maddow had a whole segment the other day about how the "Russia" scandals should or will result in the forcing-out of both Trump AND Trump's biggest policy supporter, Vice President Pence - http://archive.is/tfaRs

<TEXT> He definitely does. He's been referencing NYTimes articles for a year and a half now--he talked about in dozens of speeches throughout his campaign, calling the paper "the FAILING NYTimes," and he'd use that label while quoting something from it; he wouldn't just say "I don't like the Failing NYTimes." It's the same way he references segments and commentators from CNN (tweeting about how so-and-so just lied about him and he "doesn't watch anymore") and even Saturday Night Live, just as he reads the Wall Strete Journal and watches Fox News (tweeting about how Megyn Kelly just lied about him and he "doesn't watch anymore"). The NYTimes is still the United States of America's forefront newspaper and "paper of record." Trump himself even paid to publish a full-page ad in the NYTimes, on September 2, 1987, seeking to change the mind of then-President Reagan: http://i.imgur.com/MaNcHZI.png

 The New York Times has long been regarded within the industry as a national "newspaper of record".[10]

<TEXT> *More sensationalistic title:* "The current #1 iOS app is basically a ripoff of a Jobs-Wozniak arcade game!"

**Here's the iOS *Overall* app chart right now, showing the most downloaded apps of March 28, 2017:**

**Here's where I saw the description comparing it to the classic Atari arcade game that was released 41 years ago:**

Here's the developer's official site, and you can see dozens of other games right here on the homepage:

***Follow-up -*** I just checked the official iTunes Chart and I see that Bitmoji has once again taken the top spot -

http://www.apple.com/itunes/charts/free-apps/

As Business Insider reported the other day in an article listing the 11 fastest-growing apps in the US from Dec 2014 - Dec 2016, Bitmoji is #1 as well. This has been viewed 177,000 times since it was posted 4 days ago. It gives a very useful look at where the mobile Internet (i.e. the Internet) is going. Bitmoji has been the #1 iPhone app (overall) almost every single day since January 11, 2017, and has been the #1 iPhone Utility every day since July 20, 2016, as shown on the AppAnnie graph below.

<TEXT> What politician represented the original late-1970s punk movement in Britain? None, as that was the starting point, the initial defining opposition movement, and that movement was a reaction against the establishment political class. As for what politician is a manifestation of rebellion against the establishment political class since then, it is only just now there is one, and actually several: Nigel Farage (UK), Donald Trump (US), Marine Le Pen (France), Geert Wilders (Netherlands), Frauke Petry (Germany), and Norbert Hofer (Austria). Each of those political figures is rebelling against the establishment political class--and that's what makes this tidal wave of populism so unusual and so historic. When the US election was Al Gore vs. George Bush, or Barack Obama vs. Mitt Romney, that was two candidates who were very much long-time entrenched members of the ruling elite. (Romney was a top executive of a financial firm, called Bain Capital, from 1984 to 2002, and was then the Governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007.) But those others I just named are definitely not members of that elite--and the nonstop media attacks against them are an indicator on that.

<TEXT> If the culture is embodied by the leader of a country, does that mean that on Election Day 2016, the American majority switched from leftwing-dominant (where conservatives were the counterculture) to rightwing-dominant (where liberals again became the counterculture)? There were about 136 Million people who voted, but then another *100 Million* eligible voters who chose not to vote at all. So their vote was at least against BOTH the main candidates, if not against the whole system itself. Or perhaps many of them don't even care at all and just figure the voting makes no difference.

<TEXT> His main point is that there has been flip in that the right was authoritarian side in the '70s, but that the left has become the authoritarian side today. He showed a few clips of conservatives in the '70s who wanted to censor punk music and culture. Now there is a continual effort to censor and stop conservative or pro-Trump sentiments. I myself have been permanently banned from a few subreddits (such as Feminism and AfricanAmerican) for posting videos that show a conservative point of view, and had previously posted many non-conservatives posts in Feminism and WASN'T banned or blocked or anything. 

Conservatives control the main religion of the US, yes, but how strong is that religion, or any religion, in many of the states that just voted for Hillary? Millions of Christian American adults are celebrating Christmas and Easter, but how much are they doing anything beyond that? 

And how are Conservatives dominating economics? For one thing, Conservatives want to totally get rid of food stamps, and yet there are at least 43 Million people living from month to month on food stamps, as Politifact, which hates Trump, even acknowledged:

Dec 2013: White House Seriously Considered Minting A Trillion Dollar Platinum Coin To Avoid Breaching The Debt Ceiling

http://www.businessinsider.com/white-house-seriously-considered-minting-a-trillion-dollar-platinum-coin-to-avoid-breaching-the-debt-ceiling-2013-12?op=1

From the ZeroHedge comment section:

 Platinum is too expensive. It should be made out of copper. No that is too expensive, make it out of plastic like Fisher Price:  http://tinyurl.com/a6l5cwt

 Better yet, just make it out of paper, or even better just type in $1,000,000,000,000 into a computer. 

QUOTES:

"All paper currencies are toilet paper, the dollar is simply two ply." **- Thomas Caplin**

"All the perplexities, confusion and distress in America arise not from defects in the constitution or confederation, nor from want of honor or virtue, as much from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin and circulation." **- John Adams in a letter to Thomas Jefferson**

"We are in danger of being overwhelmed with irredeemable paper, mere paper, representing not gold nor silver; no sir, representing nothing but broken promises, bad faith, bankrupt corporations, cheated creditors and a ruined people." **- Daniel Webster, speech in the American Senate, 1833**
 
"Money is a new form of slavery, and is distinguishable from the old simply by the fact that it is impersonal, there is no human relation between master and slave." ** Leo Tolstoy**

 We started covering the platinum seigniorage fiasco in June of 2011.  We thought it was a joke.

<TEXT> Maybe you're right (I'm the person who shared the article), but if there's no manipulation, I think that the reason there are such a higher number of comments on other stories is because many of those stories pertain to more hotly debated or disputed topics or people, so the are both more people voicing their view, and then there are more arguments ensuing and extending more threads. In *this* case, there are more people who wish to highlight the story, but don't feel or have an additional need to opine or the subject or the article. 

As much as we in this sub are well aware of who Monsanto is (forget even Cargill, mentioned in the title) and the various outrageous things they do, I don't think more than 1 out 100 random adults walking down the street in any big U.S. city would be able to answer the question of "Who or what is Monsanto?" Certainly the mainstream media isn't covering the company's activities much. 

 Agenda-setting theory is the theory that the mass-news media have a large influence on audiences by their choice of what stories to consider newsworthy and how much prominence and space to give them. Agenda-setting theorys central axiom is salience transfer, or the ability of the mass media to transfer importance of items on their mass agendas to the public agendas. As political scientist Bernard C. Cohen wrote in 1963: **"The press may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think *about*."**

That's from an earlier version of this Wikipedia article. (I've seen Bill Maher talk about Monsanto 2 or 3 times on his show, but that's all I've seen about it on TV, and that's where I myself first head about it, and that's on HBO. )

 **Mr. Ackman's $4 billion loss in Valeant more than wiped out the $2.2 billion he made in 2014 on Allergan. Mr. Ackman had never invested in the pharmaceutical industry when he put over $3 billion into Allergan.**

 In an email to The New York Times, Pershing Square said, "Valeant is an anomaly in an outstanding record over nearly 14 years."

 But while his funds notched an exceptional 40 percent gain in 2014  much of it attributable to the Allergan trade that has drawn the lawsuit  Mr. Ackmans funds lost 13.5 percent last year and 20.5 percent in 2015. Through March 15, Pershing Square is flat.
Other hedge funds have turned in poor performances as well in recent years. And it is not clear whether or to what extent Mr. Ackmans investors have reacted to his firms losses by fleeing. Pershing Square declined to disclose redemption figures.

**Timeline:**

 **Ackman's Valeant Holdings Lost Pershing $7.7 Million a Day**  

**http://www.investopedia.com/news/ackmans-valeant-holdings-lost-pershing-77-million-day-vrx/**

Look at the acquisition spree that Allergan itself was on, over the past few years! See how many times "Acq" appears on the chart! No wonder he thought, in May 2015, that Valeant could be a "very early-stage Berkshire" -

<TEXT> If a large percentage of members of country do not support the currency of that country, that can correlate to social instability and a rising populist sentiment. You don't see how that can be possible? The people don't like the monetary system that the country is forcing them to transact in. Therefore, there is a rising instability (lack of confidence) and the desire for a return to their own national currency (as has been seen with demands for the drachma among people in Greece).   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The euro is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the 28 member states of the European Union, and the euro entirely replaced the national currency of each of those eurozone nations. Thus, the percentage of support for that currency is an indicator of the sentiment of citizens of European countries towards the eurozone and broader European Union project.

<TEXT> I myself still have a flip phone, but I think Snapchat will be huge, and here are many reasons:

First, regarding news, the NYTimes and Washington Post had enough faith in Snapchat to partner with the company just last month:

NYT: http://investors.nytco.com/press/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/The-New-York-Times-Announces-Upcoming-Launch-on-Snapchat-Discover/default.aspx

WaPo: http://fortune.com/2017/02/13/washington-post-snapchat/

And here are some recent articles with some different views, which I agree with. One major thing is its video business.

http://cornellsun.com/2017/03/15/letter-to-the-editor-why-we-should-value-snap/

https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2017/03/12/snaps-ipo-was-a-success-because-it-fell-19-not-despite-it-falling/

Comcast invested: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2017/03/07/heres-why-comcast-is-investing-in-snap/

Vice Media partnering: http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/vice-snapchat-shows-action-bronson-1202008566/

April 2, 2015, Bloomberg: Snapchat is "the new MTV."

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-02/snapchat-s-discover-feature-video-ad-model-resembles-tv

Feb 5, 2017, The Wall Street Journal: Snapchat is "the new TV" altogether.

http://archive.is/yQjra

Feb 16, 2017, TechCrunch: Snapchat is "the HBO of mobile."

https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/16/snapchat-shows/

And Snap's only 2 apps, Bitmoji and Snapchat, are currently being downloaded more than any of the 4 Facebook apps (Fb, Mssnger, IG, and WhatsApp), which I'd say makes them the B2C Internet company with the most potential to be the next big one. Bitmoji has been #1 or #2 every day since Juan 11, 2017. Keep in mind that Facebook's stock took 15 months to climb back up to its IPO share price (May 2012 - Aug 2013) -

<TEXT> I agree--it's much like how a full-Internet-serving, photo-and-video-capable smartphone become what we now understand as a "phone," while the previous decades concept of a phone is now called a "landline." I recently saw someone say that people should stop saying "flatscreen TV" and just say "TV," just as people stopped saying "color TV" in the late 1960s. 

 It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that autumn. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later.

<TEXT> **FTFY** = **F**iat **T**oiletpaper **F**ails **Y**ou

I thought that too, and I think that author purposely says "blockchain" in the headline because there are so many kneejerk anti-Bitcoin readers out there who tune out as soon as they see the word. Incidentally, those same people also don't seem to know or understand what the blockchain is; they blur Bitcoin together with all sorts of online scams. I know a guy who's been saying that "Bitcoin is Bitbullshit" for years; in fact, he even wrote that statement in an email on January 28, 2013, when Bitcoin was at $19.87, amusingly (as that was the year of the big stock market crash of the '80s).

<TEXT> That's not me, it was just a video I found, but yeah, I noticed that too! There are drummers who definitely drum that way. I actually read a Neil Peart interview many years ago where he was saying how he studied with some drumming master who taught him to play more mindfully of the upward rebound after every stroke. Something like "Always make sure to be constantly bringing it back up every single time." This is almost analogous to how people who've been walking around for a while won't lift their feet as high as they keep going.

<TEXT> Yeah, the app right now is definitely for younger users, immature and flighty users. Even in their IPO roadshow video (linked below), they talk first first a 13-34 demographic, but then divide it in half and say how the younger half is far more engaged, and also uses traditional media far less.

 I just can't comprehend how this can result in higher time engagement with the platform compared to the likes of Twitter where you literally have stream after stream after stream of content and comments to read.

Then you also simply don't know or haven't seen just how short the average teenager's attention span is, and how they are constantly onto the next thing--AND how relentless narcissistic and exhibitionistic they are. Even when Evan Spiegel introduced the idea for the app to his classmates at Stanford, the reaction was that it an optimal sexting app, and now it's made for both photos AND videos. I mean, I remember seeing an interview in the '90s where Spike Lee was complaining about how music videos were partly to blame for how movies cut angles and scenes so frequently: "It's like cut, cut, cut." I also know from several years ago that *Spongebob Squarepants* cartoons cut scenes more frequently than any other cartoon, and of course it's cutting away to all sorts of absurd and unrelated things. The article was saying that such programming can exacerbate ADD and ADHD in kids. 

Snapchat users are communicating with each other through the app. And that's the fundamental concept of it, as Evan Spiegel says at the start of this roadshow video, as he weaves together the evolution of the camera with the evolution of the keyboard-connected desktop computer. And just think about the very name: snap + chat = photo-talking--and now also video-clip-talking. 

You need click "I agree" to watch it:

I myself still own a flip phone, but I see Snap as being a hugely successful company. They have 4 products: 

- The **Snapchat** app, which has dozens of celebrities using and therefore promoting it

http://www.capitalfm.com/music-news/celebrity-popstar-snapchat-usernames/

(MTV is even trying to guilt-trip Taylor Swift into joining: http://www.mtv.com/news/2918852/taylor-swift-needs-snapchat/)

- The **Bitmoji** app, which has been the #1 iPhone app for 6 whole weeks now - From Wednesday Jan 11 to Wednesday Feb 22) -

https://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/top/united-states/overall/iphone/

And the #1 iPhone utility for over 7 months now -

You can create an AppAnnie account and see the history:

- And then Snap has **Spectacles** - with nearly 5,000 pairs being sold on eBay in the past 90 days, and look at how much money people have been spending on them--with the higher prices being in November, due to the scarcity effect:

http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?LH_Complete=1 LH_Sold=1 _from=R40 _sacat=0 _nkw=Snapchat+Spectacles _sop=16

- And then there's the **SnapPhone** that they are apparently developed with Google--it's no accident that these designs made by some independent company have been picked up by major news websites:

<TEXT> *Notably:*

 At the time of its IPO, Snap has less revenues than any of its peer group, other than LinkedIn, and is losing more money than any of them. Before you view this is a death knell for Snap, one reason for Snaps big losses is that unlike its competitors, Snap pays for server space as it acquires new users, thus pushing up its operating expenses (and pushing down capital investment in servers). There is one other dimension where Snap measures up more favorably against at least two of the other companies: **its users are spending more time on its platform that they were either on Twitter and LinkedIn, and it ranks second only to Facebook on this dimension.**

 This document describes techniques and devices for radar-based gesture-recognition through a wearable device. The techniques enable an easy-to-use input interface through this wearable radar device, in contrast to small or difficult-to-use input interfaces common to wearable computing devices. Further, these techniques are not limited to interfacing with wearable computing devices, but may aid users in controlling various non-wearable devices, such as to control volume on a stereo, pause a movie playing on a television, or select a webpage on a desktop computer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I still own and use a flip phone and I have zero desire to ever buy a smartphone, let alone smartglasses. I just wanted to get the word out to everyone that the Spectacles were for sale as soon as I saw that they were, through someone who pointed it out on Twitter at that moment. I didn't know who might be interested, so I announced it in a bunch of different subs and let the chips fall where they may.

<TEXT> I think Google will nevertheless happily add it to their current Android phones, of which are there are no fewer than 10 vaunted up on the Android homepage: the LG G5, HTC 10, HTC Bolt, LG V20, Pixel (that Google's *own* phone), Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Sony Xperia XZ, Moto X, Nexus 6P, and Nexus 5X! And I think it'll sell well, and that the whole "Snap" branding and corresponding design is one reason, as shallow as that may seem.
 
https://www.android.com/phones/

I also predict that Spectacles will be huge; the demand shown on eBay and the prices paid for them is just one reason I say that: While I dn't know how many were purchases from the "Snapbots," you can see that over 5,000 pairs have been sold in the past 90 days, and here they are, in descending price order, with 54 being bought for between $500-599, and another 106 being bought for between $400-499:

<TEXT> I thought that was ridiculous too--that they went from a social-media company to a "camera" one--but about a week ago I checked if anyone was actually selling and buying Snapchat Spectacles (their camera-sunglasses) on eBay, and as of right now, over the 90 days, over 2,700 pairs were sold, and the most expensive 150 of those were sold for $500 or more. Here's the link, and just to be clear about my own interest in the company, I have no desire to ever use the app or wear those glasses, but I do think the company will be very successful.

<TEXT> It's not about violent vs. peaceful, it's about reasonable reactions vs. overreactions. Marching would not be an overreaction to a tweet? That's the point he was making: about overreactiveness. There hasn't been an actual march dedicated to rebuking one of Trump's tweets, and at all the protests thus far, I didn't see any sign that was about something he tweeted. So he was saying it figuratively to make the point about the constant hysteria and outrage in the mainstream media and expressed by Trump critics over multiple things every day. 

How have the protests been successful? Because the mainstream media reported about them? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  With luck in 4 years Trump will be voted out

The odds are not in favor of that: There's a Republican majority in the Senate, House, and governorships was just reinforced, and the large majority of states voting in the 2018 midterms voted for Trump in the general election, including 5 of the 6 states that flipped from Democrat to Republican (WI, MI, OH, PA, and FL, not IA). With the absolutely nonstop coverage of him on TV and online (not to mention in print magazines and newspapers), the people who voted for him saw more of him and more about him than they ever did of any other candidate in any U.S. election, and he still won 30 states and 1 county, which gave him 77 more electoral votes than the Democrat candidate. You're hoping that tens of millions of Republican voters turn against him and against the Republican party and vote for Democrat or something else. I don't see that as possible. The media has been trying to stop him since his candidacy announcement speech in June 2015; we are now in the third week of his administration, and his Attorney General and Secretary of Health and Human Services were both confirmed in the past two days.

<TEXT> *As noted on Hacker News:*

There's a missing parameter here: the number of recharge cycles a battery can have without losing large capacity , because over the long term - decades, like done in this business, that's what determines the cost per kwh charge stored and supplied, i.e. what end users pay for.

Without those numbers, it's not possibe to judge Tesla against the competition, for example Alevo, which claims more the 50,000 charge cycles, vs ,i believe, 5000 charge cycles for Tesla.

For Alevo, the final cost per store/supplied should be ~3cents/kwh, over 20 earss lifespan, which should make grid storage very economical.

*And another commenter responded:*

$0.03/kWh delivered is an order of magnitude less than current lithium ion systems which ranges $0.285/kWh - $0.581/kWh delivered to the grid after storage. [1].

Since the data going into Lazard's models are probably at least more than a year old, I wouldn't be surprised if its currently $0.15-$0.30/kWh to store and then deliver a kWh of electricity.

The largest price difference in Southern California Edison's time-of-use tiers is from $0.11/kWh to $0.47/kWh, so I expect that the systems that Southern California Edison is currently installing are fairly cost efficient for them.

If Alevo can actually deliver at $0.03/kWh at scale (and personally I'm skeptical of something that sounds so good), then that's game over for all fossil fuels and nuclear on the electrical grid.

<TEXT> Similarly, as a commenter in /r/Science said:

Potential confounder: many of us who started young were doing it to escape from violence, sexual assault or other trauma/drama. Lots of depression and other mental illness in this population.

Trauma and depression/mental disorders are independently associated with similar outcomes. Hard to know which way the arrow is facing from an epigenetic perspective.

Still a great study, my takeaway: smoking that young may be more of a red flag, help needed here, vs a risk factor for long term cognitive performance loss.

<TEXT> Pasting the top comment on Hacker News about it, from a user named "abalone":

What's really interesting about this is not just that Lattner is brilliant and liked, but that is highlights just how critical *software correctness and reliability* is to autonomous vehicles. Naively one might have expected some machine learning expert to take over the reins at Tesla. But fast-moving Silicon Valley needs a fundamental shift in quality standards when it comes to safety-critical software, and if you look closely, Lattner has been leading this charge at the language and compiler level.

His work has been distinguished by the melding of language *safety, reliability and clarity,* that is, not merely having sophisticated constructs that help the guarantee correctness, but also making code simple, beautiful and easy to read. Ultimately writing safe code depends on the ability of the programmer to comprehend it, so creating a programming environment that's successful on all fronts is a foundational achievement.

A notable example: LLVM enabled ARC, a beautifully simple approach to memory management that removed much (not all) of the need for the developer to implement details in code, while providing high efficiency and, perhaps even more importantly, predictable performance (no garbage collection pauses). These are all essential for safety-critical realtime software.

<TEXT> But actually the main point of that article is that failure tests a person and strengthens them if they choose to learn from it, and *that* leads them to success, as long as they keep trying and learning, and trying more and learning more, until they reach that success.

3 Arnold Schwarzenegger quotes:

Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength.

Training gives us an outlet for suppressed energies created by stress and thus tones the spirit just as exercise conditions the body.

The resistance that you fight physically in the gym and the resistance that you fight in life can only build a strong character.

Winners know when to quit: when they win. ;)

I doubt, however, that Ronda Rousey will fight another UFC match. She's already begun an acting career as it is. 

And I really wonder about Facebook's future:

<TEXT> Here is an interesting list of 15 facts about the number 2017. One fact that I found particularly compelling is that "The sum of all odd primes up to 2017 is a prime number, i.e. 3+5+7+11+...+2017 is a prime number. " I saw the link to this on the computer programmer forum Hacker News, and I have linked to that below as well.

<TEXT> If you enjoy it, do it. Most people really seem to second-guess themselves and stand hold themselves back, for no good reason. It's about doing what you enjoy, in the mere percentage of time you have that is not spent sleeping, eating, driving, shopping, washing up, waiting for things, and so on. If the only people permitted to pursue careers in thew field were school teachers and professors, and Fields Medal competitors, there wouldn't be much advancement--or enjoyment--of what math is, and it is nothing without people engaging in the study and practice of it.

<TEXT> I think that loneliness has been shown to cause OCD as well. All the time alone causes some people's mind to get more and more neurotic, with no other person or circumstances around to stop or control the development of that type of thinking and behavior. Furthermore, I've seen how people with OCD hae gotten even worse in solitude, while others (or the same people) have gotten better when they live with others.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It seems to me that people in general are obsessed with forming social connections.

I think you mean that in the context of social-media "connections" or "friends" (be it on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, even LinkedIn, or wherever), and the emotional pain or unhappiness that comes from wanting more such "friends" and more online attention. Obsessive real-life friend-searchers are extremely few, at least in America; friendships don't form so quickly. You cab quickly have a lot of peers and co-members, like if you're a college student who just joined a fraternity, but is every other member a friend in the standard sense? 

 there are a lot of initiatives to help people who struggle with loneliness but I know of not a single one that helps people who crave solitude but can't get it.

What kind of initiative are there for people who have general loneliness? And, conversely, what type of initiative could there be to help someone who craves solitude by can't get it? If I'm currently unable to move out of my parents' house and have 8 siblings, what could there be for me? Or if I'm unable to move out of this small apartment where I have 6 roommates, what could help me? A cash-raising initiative to help me move out? GoFundMe? :)

<TEXT> I went through the American public-school system in New York state and never even heard the name "Uzbekistan" once, from kindergarten all the way to my senior year of college. We learn absolutely nothing about those countries, whether you're talking about Kazakhstan or Mongolia or whatever. Virtually no America could locate the countries on a blank world map. I lived in New York City and no one I know would know anything whatsoever about Uzbekistan. I could say it's an area in Afghanistan, or located directly above India. No one would know. 

Even American news completely ignores most of the world all year round. Meanwhile, I see that Obama and/or Trump are on the front page of foreign newspapers every week. Here are today's newspapers (scroll down to the last third of the page for the non-American papers) -

HE not going to be talking to trash to people who have nothing to do with the sport. I mean, let's say he were alone at your restaurant and no one else was around, and you came up to him, introduced yourself as an MMA fan (or fighter) and volunteered some negative critiques of his abilities; I think that regardless of no audience being there, that he'd have some choice words. When his teammates were being taunted by Conor McGregor, he actually got up and shoved McGregor, which I think even his teammates all thought was an insane (and perhaps insanely stupid) move here for various reasons (beginning of this video) -

<TEXT> So many great athletes, perhaps even most, are boastful and mocking, but another way to view it is as being brash (or grandstanding) and silly (or poking fun at the competitor). Of course in the NFL, NBA, NHL, and so on, virtually all of the trash-talking and shows of disdain are not heard by the live audience or TV audience, but I think that purely humble and deferential pro athletes are few and far between. And in combat sports, the best have done notorious amounts of boasting and mocking in and out of the ring: Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, and Conor McGregor. Ronda Rousey too, until last year.

And the idiotic Daily Mirror literally refers to her as Princess Leia:

<TEXT> The newspaper business is a lot like the TV news business in terms of local affiliates. Like there's the USA Today Network, whose article was used in a few of those, sometimes with a different headline, and then there's the Metro newspaper network, which even exists in Brazil, and you can see that the cover with the Star Wars typeface was used in 9 different local papers. Then there's the Associated Press, which has articles syndicated through hundreds of news outlets in print and online, but again, the headlines are often changed by the different publishers.

Consider that someone had to decide and approve what main story to put on the front page (and the editors of other papers chose otherwise)...whoever it was *had* to be thinking that way...

"The Bass guitar player [Dee Murray] is really driving this song; busy, but very tasteful Bass work." 

Also see the 1980 Central Park concert that is surely one of the greatest rock concerts ever recorded (same bass player too!;) -

<TEXT> This is how serious he was about working out when he started:

 Even on the weekends when the gyms were closed, he was back, wiling to break and enter to get his work out. He says that; "It would make me sick to miss a workout...I knew I couldnt look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I couldnt do it."

http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=146525523

His friends actually helped create a makeshift gym for him out of cinder blocks and metal rods.
And he's much the same today:

"My day cannot start without doing something physically," he told the magazine. "And I work out at night before bed  cardio, weight-training. I want to stay in shape as long as I can."

https://www.reddit.com/r/bodybuilding/comments/5jxeqs/arnold_schwarzenegger_admits_he_struggles_with/

He said in another interview that he and his brother had to do jumping jacks and push-ups every morning to *earn* their breakfast. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aside from seconding the advice of others here who say to take a new and more open view of your physical self, I do want to point out the rather shocking rate of cosmetic surgery in the world today, as reported in the charts at the link below; you'll see that nearly 100,000 American women had breast lifts (mastopexy) in 2015. A quick google search shows that it costs [around USD $6,000](https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2 ion=1 espv=2 ie=UTF-8 q=mastopexy%20cost oq=mastopexy%20cost rlz=1C1CHMO_enUS568US569 aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l5.2325j0j9) (CAD $8,100, 4.700, 5.700, or AUD $8.300). But again, I say: Save the money and the trouble and try considering the appreciative and enthusiastic perspective that your boyfriend has! Exercise to feel good, primarily, and secondarily, to like how your body looks more, overall!

<TEXT> Exactly, it's for promotion, I think Ronda's hubris has gotten the best of her. She's talked so much trash before, but now pulls her arm away from Rogan and quickly walks off the stage like a big baby. We saw in her foolish pride in her fight against Holly Holm and I expect we'll be seeing it again. I would think she wants conclude her career on a high note, as the defeat last year was one of the biggest sports AND regular news moments in the country. Her aspirations to be a tough nitty-gritty movie star (with at least one superhero role) depends a lot on her having had a legacy as a great, WINNING fighter. If she were to win the upcoming fight, it would be hailed as a great comeback story, after a whole year of suspense. But I think Nunes will humiliate her. As McGregor has said "There were times when I won the contest, but lost the fight." In light of that, there is secondary importance to her also not being broken, bloodied up, and made to look awkward or weak in the course of the fight.

<TEXT> That seems to be true; she refused to say a single word or even remain on stage right after their staredown (link below). I thought that was very immature and cowardly and already a bad sign. I'd say that she is scared and knows she may lose again, or at least face more hits and more injury than she did with any opponent before Holly Holm.

<TEXT> Part of the way that the WWF/WWE made pro wrestling a national primetime-TV sensation in the mid 1980s, and then a global one, was because of the use of a much more highly developed storylines, which created more highly developed characters and an air of suspense and drama that engaged audiences (or engaged them far more) than would be the case if the matches were just presented as just "John Smith vs. Jim Smith! Please enjoy the display of the strength, skill, and technique!" The UFC has definitely taken a cue from that very effective way to promote the fights, with the interviews and press conferences before and after the fights. The UFC and WWE organizations are, after all, called "promotions." 

And in all actuality, many, if not most, competitive athletes (in America, anyway) actually do "talk trash" in real-life conversations about their ability and their chances of winning and being a lasting champion. Being wishy-washy or indifferent about winning, and being deferential towards one's opponents, are not conducive to a winning performance. As a lifelong sports fan, I've watched hundreds of athletes give tough-talking, boastful answers to questions. And speaking of vendettas, there are actually whole Wikipedia articles devotes to various pro-sports rivalries - here are some of the martial arts ones

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sports_rivalries#Martial_arts

Perhaps most notably, Michael Jordan's Hall of Fame enshrinement speech consists of a whole litany of F- You's to those discouraged, doubted, challenged, or played against him. The mainstream media's idiotic reaction was one of self-righteous dismay, saying it was so unfortunate that he is such a "bitter" person who needed to "settle scores." I guess they don't understand the point of a score*board* itself.

There are some very prominent examples of posthumous renown in the world of literature; Emily Dickinson's poems have been published and republished, now hundreds of websites, and have been read by millions of people, and have even been required homework reading for hundreds of thousands of students over the past 130 years, yet she had online published a few in her lifetime, and they were heavily altered by editors.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Dickinson

Meanwhile, the young French poet Arthur Rimbaud burned unpublished manuscripts of his work before he abandoned writing poetry altogether: 

 After [parting with Verlaine, Rimbaud] returned home to complete the work and published A Season in Hell. However, when his reputation was marred because of his actions with Verlaine, he received negative reviews and was snubbed by Parisian art and literary circles. In anger, Rimbaud burned his manuscripts and likely never wrote poetry again.

Reddit is a private company that can do whatever it chooses, as decided by those who own and operate the site. In all seriousness, who could or would possibly file a lawsuit about the banning of a subreddit? The site Voat cropped up in the wake of many subreddits being banned (and Voat itself has banned some as well), and I just checked and can't find any evidence of a lawsuit over a subreddit deletion.

There are things where people claiming that stuff was done for real, or in one take, but I think that's just said to make it more impressive. One music-video example is from Beyonce, who says she did the "Single Ladies" video all in one take...even though there are two points where the video could have easily included a cut. Then there are cases where a stunt double or body double is used in a film but not credited.

<TEXT> The PRIME VIDEOTAPED EXAMPLE of that from this current situation would be Scott Foval boasting emphatically and in proud detail about his history and reputation as a career political criminal. There's that one moment where he says something "You're prrrrobably familiar with my work... *[and then nodding]* Yes, that was me." He obviously thinks he's some sort of genius artist, an *auteur* of deliberately provoked anarchy. As Trump told Hillary, she should be ashamed of herself, and it's great that WE are getting these people at least nominally ashamed enough to delete their profiles! For example:

https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/593ktz/scott_foval_has_deleted_his_twitter_account/

Then, of course, there are the THOUSANDS of such written instances in the leaked emails. There are three aspects of it: the statements themselves, and then the very act of making a physical (digital) record of it, and then the conveying it, often to more than one recipient! It's funny how even the lowest-level drug dealers are more careful (or you could say paranoid) about how they conduct their transactions and communication! Like whispering, looking around, and going "Shhhh..." 

Even the average guy hawking cigarettes outside a city deli is more discreet--do you think he'd exchange emails or text messages, let alone in literal terms about his business?! But these people are just all out there with it amongst themselves, and now the WikiFLOOD reveals hundreds of individuals involved in it, from the political system AND from all different industries!  </TEXT>

The rumor I've seen here is that it's a video of her screaming at Donna Brazile backstage after NBC's "Commander-in-Chief Forum" on September 8. I think that all the leakers think that the US public's memory span is only like a day-and-a-half long...and maybe they're right. After all, look at how relentlessly Hillary keeps trying to remind everyone of things that Trump has said. She seems to think that there are lots of McCain supporters out there in the country, even though even at his most popular, he managed to get only 173 electoral votes, while Obama got 365.

<TEXT> The Trump campaign is about communication; the Hillary campaign is about expecting people to elect her just because she's been in politics for so many years and that we should just keep their big fat corrupt operation going as it has been for years. Not this time!

<TEXT> This ought to make ANYONE question the validity, accuracy, and methodology of public opinion polls. I put a bunch of the swing states first, but I expect there are many other states that Trump *is* bringing into play, as he says. I also show a parallel with the Brexit, in that NONE of the 7 mainstream-media polls in Britain projected that "Leave" would win. The people knew better than the pollsters! As you read through these, keep in mind that the standard definition of a "landslide" is +5 points or more. **Email, tweet, and share this far and wide!

**Parallel with the Brexit in terms of the polls vs. the actual voting results:**

Of 7 cumulative polls conducted by media organizations, 6 predicted that Britain would vote Remain (by a margin of 0.5% - 4%), and the other poll, conducted by *The Economist*, had the vote tied. In the end, 51.89% voted Leave, while 48.11% voted Remain; a difference of **3.78% in favor of** ***Leaving*** **the EU.**

<TEXT> Those articles actually reinforce my point: the fact that whatever Pence HAS said about foreign policy has been different, sometimes totally different, from what Trump says, seems to indicate that Trump never even talks with him about it. So, all the more so, where's the basis that Pence would be his foreign-policy advisor? In fact, in the 2nd debate, one of the moderators read a long statement from Pence about Syria and Russia, and Trump said flat-out: "He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree. I disagree." That instance is just another reason I disagree with your prediction.

<TEXT> What are you basing that on? I've been following the election by spending many hours every day watching speeches, interviews, and reading articles and comments, and discussing things here, and Mike Pence has said just about absolutely nothing about foreign policy. Based on his speeches and interviews, he clearly covers the faith and family values area of Trump's platform--and of the Republican platform (what Ted Cruz was all about, and what GWBush also defined himself with)--while Trump covers foreign policy, jobs, trade, healthcare, and education. Pence's rhetoric is that folksy, midwestern, small-town, church-going, rural type; within U.S. Republican politics, it's an exact counterbalance to Trump's blunt-talking, big-city, competitive, businessman persona. In fact, during the primary, Pence expressed support for Cruz, then for Trump, then Cruz again, and then a couple months later, Pence was introduced as Trump's running-mate.

<TEXT> Hired loser shouting "Iron my shirt!" at a Hillary speech in January 2008 - 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsocCWiLh3s

Then yesterday - Another hired loser, jumping around like a fish while all the people around him just HAPPEN to form a neat big circle. I wonder if this was a Scott Foval "Production" ;);) -

Compare those with when she is confronted with REAL protesters (who were chanting about the environment) - Hey, where's the instant zinger?? She's totally lost without a script from her various puppetmasters -

<TEXT> Also, notice how the people around him form a very neat, big circle around him while he jumps around like a fish. NO ONE was trying to grab him or move him? I bet even THOSE people were paid off to give him space to put on his act. I just wonder if he was hired by Scott Foval before Foval got fired, or by whoever replaced him. Recall in the first Veritas video how he bragged about hiring mentally ill people to disrupt events inside and outside. Chicago event, the Arizona highway-blocking, it's all fake as hell.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mike Pence has talked of "Clinton Corruption Fatigue" (see below), but the freakin tolerance and cynicism level of some people is so goddamn high, and the attention span and MEMORY span is so short, that I think all the most extremely shockingly damning videos, emails, and revelations will probably ALL come out literally TWO DAYS before the election, and I FULLY EXPECT the other side to release whatever they have (probably a video or audio track) then, too. Notice how Hillary has to keep very heavy-handedly going through her whole rigmarole of smears against Trump (McCain, disabled reporter, the distorted Khan story); even the people who fall for her dishonest demagoguing AND who care about it FORGET IT after five seconds.

<TEXT> I think they are fewer than they may seem. We are here on Reddit, and Reddit is popular, but when you narrow down the entire monthly userbase JUST to the AMERICAN users who are at least 18 years old and who have ANY interest into politics, the number is a very tiny percentage of the ELECTORATE. It really is a bubble, or a circle jerk, as so many meta-subreddits are named. On a related note, I have found that the English-language subreddits about certain other large countries (such as Japan, Russia, and Germany) are overrun with comments from American cucks. I was once arguing with someone with German-flag flair who was furious about Trump (I forgot on what subreddit) and after a few exchanges, I was like "You're really from Germany?" and he said no, but then "I was there 2 years ago. I know what's like." And so it turns out that Internet discussion is often just another type of MMORPG -

<TEXT> I live in New York City and I've been friends for many years with a girl now who used to be a stripper, and she wanted to take a break from working at the club back in late 2006-early 2007, so she joined a few of the "Sugar Daddy" websites (SeekingArrangement is now hugely popular), and I remember that she told me how some "sheikh" from KUWAIT wrote her a long message offering her to come and move there with him for some absurd amount of money, and she was seriously considering it!! She was seriously weighing THAT offer alongside an offer for a restaurant date from some fat 26-year-old white doughy guy from New Jersey who was wearing a football jersey in his profile pic. I was like "Are you fuckin crazy??" and explained that she'd be living for the rest of her life as part of a whole group (I didn't say the funny-sounding word "harem") of sex slaves to a bunch of Arab guys. Thankfully, these past couple years, she's just been involved with some big fat white pharmaceutical company guy who visits her from Virginia every couple months, and she actually met him at the latest club where she worked until she got pregnant from a one-night stand with a young guy she met at a Thanksgiving dinner.

<TEXT> Because there's already a new, active, loyal userbase for the other service. Think about what compelled Facebook to buy Instagram and then WhatsApp. They want the users, who are ultimately advertisement-consumers, as advertising is what fuels Facebook's business. There are 3 ways to make money from the Internet: 

- the 1st is by hosting ads, which is what virtually every website does, and that's how Google totally re-defined the global economy in the early 2000s (the company IPO'd as NASDAQ:GOOG in August 2004); ads are also the basis of Facebook's business, of course (NASDAQ:FB)

- the 2nd is by selling access or special features of a site or app (paid apps, paywalled news websites)

- the 3rd is by selling a product or service to people, and using the website as a store (Amazon, Ebay, Zazzle, and countless T-shirt selling websites) 

- and the 4th is by begging users to donate (as Wikipedia does)

The approach that most companies take is "U.R.L" - "Ubiquity (or Users) first, Revenue Later." The sites and apps you see that just try to grow without appearing to do anything to make money are just looking to attract and retain users (readers, listeners, viewers, players, visitors), whom they will later target one those 4 above-named business models at.

The late-night TV hosts all make at least one joke about his appearance every night since he announced his candidacy. I've never seen anyone point this out, but it's stupid bullshit and so I guess it should just continued to be ignored as such.

<TEXT> Google Translation of the article:

**Minister for the law to filter Internet porn in Israel**

**The Ministerial Committee on Legislation voted to law initiated by MK Shuli Mualem Jewish home by which ISPs will be obliged to block porn sites surfers in Israel. Consumers who want to surf porn sites will be able to do so only after eviction provide and ask for it explicitly. The bill was approved unanimously and unopposed.**

Committee for Legislation voted at noon (Sunday) for Promotion of law initiated by MK Shuli Mualem, chairman of the Jewish Home faction, according to which ISPs will be obliged to filter out inappropriate content - unless the customer asks another. Initiated the bill said in response: "Child's easier to consume content online than hard ice cream kiosk to buy local."The bill was approved unanimously and unopposed.
 
The bill stipulates that Internet access provider will provide an efficient service to all subscribers of Web filtering harmful and harmful content on the Internet. For this screening service provider may not charge subscription free Internet access in addition to the payment it collects from service for Internet access.
 
Supplier shall inform the subscriber, after ensuring that no minor that they can avoid filtering service in one of these ways:
By notice in writing or orally at the time of the contract with the supplier.
When you call a customer service center of power.
Using the vendor's website. 
 
The explanatory notes to the Act states: "In the last decade the internet has become the world into a global village and it provides greater access to information and variety. Internet with parties and contents are considered negative, such as gambling, pornography, pedophilia, etc., which can affect and damage the public is exposed to, especially for children. In recent years there has been a marked increase the reports about the number of minors affected by exposure to sexual content and offensive language on the Internet. "
 
It also says in the explanatory notes that "hundreds of studies in the country and the world record and examine the various infringements caused by exposure to the same content and the effects in the long term. In discussions on the subject showed that 60% of children in Israel aged 9 to 15 visits to pornographic sites. Also found that only 47% of children in Israel At age have private in-room computer with which they go online, so that the danger to fall victim to pedophiles has increased significantly due to the lack of parental supervision. "
 
To date aggression against Israel providers were required to inform customers about filtering options through handouts mail and advertising on their sites, but many customers were not aware of those possibilities. Therefore offer MKs to change the default and determine that the ISP will have to provide an efficient service to all subscribers or web filtering offensive content set, free of charge.
 
These MKs signed the bill: Shuli Mualem, Nissan Slomiansky, Bezalel Smotrich, Eitan Cabel, Meirav Ben-Ari, karin elharar, Oded Forer, Hamad Amar, Moti Yogev, Aliza Lavie, Yifat Shasha lining, Uri drying rack, Rachel Azariah, Aida Touma-Suleiman, David Bitan, Nava morning, Ahmed Tibi, Elazar Stern, Yaakov Margi, Menachem Eliezer Moses, Moshe Gafni, Roy Folkman, Zouheir Bahloul, Abraham bitten, Yoav Ben-Tzur and Abdullah Abu Marouf. Similar proposals were also raised in two previous income, but not passed.

# The people of Haiti HATE the Clintons, and rightfully so! -

 Nevertheless, the Clintons are facing a growing backlash that too little has been accomplished in the past five years, and that some of the most high-profile projects they have backed  including the Marriott, another luxury hotel and the industrial park  **have helped foreign investors and Haitis wealthy elites more than its poor.**

 Bill Clinton is a good guy and well-intentioned, **but the people here dont think so  they think hes here making money, said Leslie Voltaire, a former government official who worked with Clinton on post-earthquake reconstruction. There is a lot of resentment about Clinton here. People have not seen results. . . . They say that Clinton used Haiti.**

Then this great line:

 **Why is he hiding, or being hidden? (Closed door money solicitations do not count).**

And lastly:

 Regarding the Times story, how about the campaign telling voters and media that she believes in something more powerful, inspirational and visionary **than what television interviews she plans to appear on to improve her negative trust ratings?**

<TEXT> Looks like Wikileak-leaks are seeping into the cracks of the dam of censorship! MSM had actually covered at least a couple things before--I can't remember what exactly, but I know this isn't the FIRST time that the Clinton Wikileak stuff has gotten big write-ups--but now it's more extensive, and that was the first time I saw the group of major papers ALL cover the same story on thier front pages on the same day. 

It COULD also be that people are tweeting (and even emailing) news outlets and mainstream political journalists like crazy, as O'Keefe urged people to do in one of his videos the other day. Alex Jones was saying the other day that Infowars twitter account was tweeting at all the major networks about O'Keefe' videos, and of course the two of them did an interview as well.

<TEXT> Their fucking vocal cords and brains and every waking move were all under the absolute and total control of their money-masters, aka puppet-masters. In the primary debates, Trump's opponents were all continuously holding back, because they can only say and do exact what their backers have ordered them to do, and I'm sure among that was "DON'T take any risks, DON'T 'go rogue,' DON'T act like Trump, as he'll just burn out within a week or so because of the crazy shit he says." And then all 16 challengers fell one by one, and now 11 of them endorse him. See the last column on the list here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_presidential_candidates,_2016

Then, a few years after that, there'll be another one, and then another one. People want an online commons for communicating and sharing stuff with other people (in parallel to real-life relationships), so there'll always be some major service, and of course in the '90s it was AOL.

<TEXT> The description you give of yourself is extremely similar to mine. I've voted solidly Democrat in every presidential, midterm, and local election since I turned 18, and now I'm voting for Trump, who has drastically re-defined the Republican platform, so he's not actually a standard Republican as we have understood the label to mean over the past 35 years, but he knew that to run as an Independent or a third party would guaranteed be a waste of time, energy, and money, as Ron Paul (who ran as a Libertarian in '88 and then as a Republican candidate in 2008 and 2012), Bernie Sanders (who switched from Independent to Democrat right before running), and Trump (who ran on the Reform Party platform in 2000 and then as a Republican this time around) himself have all indicated. This was Ron Paul's highest-profile appearance in the '88 election:

 Richard L. "Jake" Siewert, Jr. (born February 1, 1964) is head of corporate communications for Goldman Sachs. He served as White House Press Secretary during the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton and in Treasury department during the Obama Administration.

 In June 2009, Siewert joined the Obama administration in a position advising Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.[1][3]

Classic example of the revolving door!

 In politics, the "revolving door" is a movement of personnel between roles as legislators and regulators and the industries affected by the legislation and regulation.

<TEXT> He definitely thought he was invincible. In the footage from the bar, he brags so emphatically about having done this for YEARS, in previous electionS, and he's like (paraphrasing) "I'm sure you're familiar with my work..." Saying "my work," like he's a fucking sophisticated *auteur* of anarchy just because he wears a pink shirt and shiny white tie. Anyway, an interesting thing about the videos is that the footage is spread out from different times, as indicated by his hair. He has GOT to be having some insanely paranoid nightmares about the very face of the whoever was filming him. Imagine hiring some enthusiastic person to work for you, who totally seems to be on-board with everything you do, and then they release hidden-camera footage of all the most self-incriminating things you said?!

<TEXT> The American public's memory span is not more than 2-full days long. Want some examples of that? Consider the 40 or 50 media-hysteria-exaggerated "campaign-ending" things that Trump said over the past 16 months; Hillary keeps dredging up the "scandals" about the Mexican judge and the disabled reporter, but who is she winning over with that, at this point? I myself have won 2 monetary bets with a friend about this: first, my friend predicted the campaign would end after the David Duke bullshit (he was like "that's it! he's too racist too run!"), and then that it would end after the Chris Matthews question about abortion ("that's it! he just the vote of every woman!").

<TEXT> The early 21st-century America is so fundamentally different society, political system, and culture from any year of 19th-century America, that I can't help but think that your view of things may be clouded by your study of history. The two almighty monolithic parties have been so entrenched in our society and so ingrained in the American psyche at a full 50-state national level for generations now, and perhaps the most massive difference between now and the 1800s, from 1800 all the way to 1899, is that we are totally bombarded by national media force: follow the history from newspapers to magazines to radio to television to the Internet to social media, and it's hard for the average person to even notice, let alone really see and understand just how slyly and how thoroughly the two-party duopoly, the mainstream media, and major corporations have sunk their claws into social media (See: https://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/4nip9u/astroturfing_information_megathread_xpost_rshills/). Even for those who assiduously avoid consuming any *news* media, the *entertainment* media machine has political views and attitudes and assumptions implicitly in the storylines and dialogue. 

It was acknowledged by Ron Paul in 2008 and 2012, and by Trump many times early in his current campaign, that if you run as a third party, the national two-party duopoly makes it so incredibly difficult to get press coverage (in whatever form), get included in a single debate or forum with a major candidate, and get on ballots--but the lack of press coverage is the most devastating preventative measure taken against them, as TV, [Yahoo](http://www.ebizmba.com/articles/news-websites), and Facebook (with its cleverly manipulated Twitter-like "Trending" sidebar) are where the America masses, from coast to coast, find out about anything or anyone. I wonder what actual percentage of Americans would know the name or face of Gary Johnson or Jill Stein. There have been officially self-label "Independent" candidates who were in debates, like Ross Perot, but I'm talking about anew party, not a party of one--and he withdrew in July and said it was because Republicans disrupted his daughter's wedding, then re-entered later:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1992#Ross_Perot.27s_candidacy

So, to predict a slow decline of the two-party system is, in my view, to willfully disregard just how powerful the two-party system really is. Even as the 2 main Veritas fraud videos have gotten 5M and 3M views on YouTube, and were played fully on Hannity Fox News show, there are still tens of millions of voters who would refuse, right off the bat, to even watch the videos for more than a minute, let alone at all, because of the source and how the mainstream media has been aggressively bashing O'Keefe. And CNN, the NYTimes, et al, are giving their own drastic editing, characterization, and contextualization of the videos: note how virtually every single sentence of this Times article works to undermine O'Keefe as well as Trump: http://archive.is/6oTFU. Even in my own personal life, living in Manhattan, I work with and am also even related to several well-spoken young and middle-aged adults who graduated with good grades from various universities (for whatever that may be worth), and they flat-out refused to watch the videos or take them seriously. I've been hearing these people say that Trump is a "joke," an "idiot," and a "psycho" for months and months. 

Michael Moore has been repeatedly proclaiming the demise of the Republican Party over the past 15 years, and yet, in July of this year, he published a detailed list of reasons why Trump will win: http://archive.is/7wGHO. **But I'll put this in concrete terms and let the test of time see who prevails:** ***What*** **specific actual  major third party do YOU see emerging within the next 20 or 30 years?** If not the Libertarian, Green, or Constitution Party, then who? An official Tea Party, a Socialist Party, or what? Roger Stone has said that every president has re-created the party in his image, and *that* is what I see continuing the happen. There are huge policy differences between an Eisenhower Republican, a Reagan Republican, and W. Bush Republican, but they are all "Republicans." WITHOUT the support of current elected Republican Party officials (Senators, Congresspeople, Governors, Mayors, and others), and the sea of tens of millions of Americans who proudly identify themselves as lifelong Republicans, be they day-to-day news-followers or not--with the support in the form of statements, rally turnout, and indeed financial support--Trump would have faced far too many obstacles in terms of organization, supporter mobilization, party unity and solidarity, and even just getting his message out, as you would have to infer that there would also be a Republican AND a Democrat running against him, with their own respective party officials all opposing him. This isn't some abstract theory on my part. Ron Paul ran as a Libertarian in 1988 and later bemoaned the near impossibility of getting any chance to reach out to the public (there was his now YouTube-famous appearance as a guest on the Morton Downey Jr. Show, where he was endlessly ridiculed and insulted, but responded again and again: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxXwKPLZyVs). Then there was also Trump's Reform Party candidacy that went from October 1999 to February 2000; regarding party disorganization and disunity, he ultimately said, upon withdrawing: "So the Reform Party now includes a KlansmanMr. Duke, a Neo-NaziMr. Buchanan, and a CommunistMs. Fulani. This is not company I wish to keep." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign,_2000

If Trump wins and is the next president, my bet is that Elizabeth Warren will be the 2020 Democrat candidate, and as I see it, she's already been aggressively campaigning against him every week since he entered *this* race: https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/55q99z/pocahontas_2020_if_trump_wins_i_think_the_2020/ </TEXT>

<TITLE> Trump talks of Election FRAUD, of which there is ample evidence, while Hillary talks of Election HACKING, of which no evidence has yet been made public.

<TEXT> Thus, in a very ironic twist, it may end up being *Democrat* side (Establishment side) who "horrifyingly" challenge the results--and who do so, shortly after the precinct totals start being reported, since if a couple of those all-important "swing states" vote OVERWHELMINGLY for Trump, that will foreshadow a few others and then there's nothing they can do to stop the historic Trump landslide. This is just imaginative speculation, but it's still a good reason for there to be a paper trail! 

https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/58g0ce/operation_stop_soros_crowd_sourced_weaponized/

Again, this is just a crazy hypothetical scenario. I mean, in the past 3 elections and now this one, there have been endless predictions about the "end" of one party or the other, and that obviously hasn't happened, just as it won't happen this time, as there are just way too many members of each of the two major parties for there to be a new party. There have been a few Independent state politicians (such as Bernie Sanders and Jesse Ventura), but there hasn't been an actual third party at even *that* level in many decades, and I don't see any new third party, whether emerging from an existing major party or not, without there already being at least 20 or 30 members of that party being elected as senators, representatives, and/or governors.

That may be as many 1500 women in total. I bet that porn star was one who responded to any of the various calls for new accusers. She probably called like 3 different people, comparing how much they were willing to pay her, and then Gloria Allred jumped in and set her own percentage of the money.

<TEXT> Of course there need to be and will always be messaging services, and there'll probably be another big one to emerge and even be bought out in the next 5 years, but that doesn't somehow contradict that overall development within the tech industry that the study shows. And I don't see these VR companies as *following* a trending, but as *setting* or *leading* the trend, *leading* the future. Furthermore, the move over the past 30 years from phone calls to email and instant messaging, to texting, to messaging *apps*--with text-messaging alongside photo-messaging and video-messaging--and video-chatting, has been dramatic. I could see VR systems that involve video-chatting and video-conferencing. And in that way, VR will have reshaped messaging as we know it. So the next big messaging service may be a VR service.

<TEXT> It's that she's in terrible condition but is being propped up by the establishment, and is kept going by the people around her, as that cartoon illustrates. And this one too:

http://catholicendtimetruths.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/APfiKi.jpg

Trump supporters don't see her as some sort of mastermind running her own campaign; she just has the most name recognition and connections and it's her "turn," regardless of her failing health. There's not a contradiction. The leaked emails show just how much other campaign workers at various levels handle everything:

<TEXT> Social, email, and mobile technology companies and products are being gradually supplanted by Virtual Reality ones, thanks to the accelerating advances made in that field, and there are now a few products whose names are known to anyone who follows technology, and there is a concurrent steadily growing base of users. Consider Facebook's $2B acquisition of Oculus VR in March 2014, and then take a look at such subreddits as /r/oculus, /r/Vive, /r/GearVR, and of course, /r/virtualreality). This report provides the statistical support for the trends that are already very much developing, and perhaps just have only a year or two more before it hits the mainstream tipping-point. Consider just how rapidly such things as the mp3 player, smartphone, and tablet caught on after their release.

<TEXT> Do NOT go to the Wikipedia list of Hillary endorsements unless you were already planning to completely stop watching all TV shows and movies... Then again, all those actors and actresses are just following the orders of the few gigantic talent agencies that employ them:

 By the 2000s, Hollywood's largest talent agencies were known as the "big five"[7] or "top five".[8] Creative Artists Agency (CAA), William Morris Agency (WMA), United Talent Agency (UTA), International Creative Management (ICM), and Endeavor. In 2009 two of the agencies, Endeavor and the William Morris Agency, merged to form William Morris Endeavor (WME).

<TEXT>  Hillary is going to win

The Access Hollywood video was supposed to seriously upend his campaign, but if you believe that polls have any accuracy, consider that in 3 of the 4 latest national polls (by Investor's Business Daily, Rasmussen Reports, and LATimes/USC), Trump is actually beating her. I personally believe that he will win.

Obviously, Katy Perry isn't individually behind that feed; it's clearly just another propaganda arm of the Clinton campaign. For much of last year, her profile picture WAS Hillarys "H" logo. 

Shes the most followed Twitter user but, curiously, if she really has 92 MILLION people following, why do most of her posts only get merely a few THOUSAND likes? The real number of active daily followers is probably several thousand. More fake numbers here in this ranking of the top 1,000 users:

He's been publicly commenting on U.S. politics throughout the year, every year, for 3 decades, and has been doing so throughout the DAY, every DAY, on Twitter for over 7 years now (since March 2009). This election is EVERYTHING and we gotta be a TIDAL WAVE lifting him to victory on November 8th!!!!!

<TEXT> I thought about that, but to accuse the whole party, even though it's accurate and fully warranted, would provoke too many people to start picking out Democrats they like, and going 'Well what about Senator so-and-so? Or Governor so-and-so?'" Just the same, to say Obama used the same system will then expand and therefore complicate the argument and leave too much room for tangents. There are just too many people. The discussion has to be centralized on and around HER specifically, not "the Democrats." That's my view.

<TEXT> Regarding the timing of all these releases, I think that both of the leaking organizations understand very well that the American memory span is now just about 2 full days. That's due to the 24/7 news cycle, the internet, and the sheer way that smartphones have totally fried the average person's attention span AND memory. Look at the DOZENS of media-created and exaggerated "scandals" from all throughout Trump's campaign. There are so many that were the center of tornado of stupid coverage, but have long, LONG been forgotten, and there's just the consistent ongoing accusation that he's "racist!" and "sexist!"

Even Politico report that the official UN Twitter account called for Americans abroad to "end Trump"--and then the tweet was deleted.

<TEXT> People throw around the words like "psychopath" and "sociopath" a lot these days. I'm not a professional psychologist, but that guy has DEFINITELY gotta be something like that. The only thing I'm sure he WAS upset about was losing his job and the surely massive paycheck he got from it, but other than that, someone who has been making a LIVING acting as unconscionably as he has, does not think that what he does is wrong at all. There's no way. Also, from a moral or religious angle: when is the word "EVIL" seriously used? I'd say this is one case where it can (JUST my opinion...). Anyway, share the video with everyone everywhere and let them form their own conclusions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He has 502,000 Twitter followers and this got 1,860 retweets. Just considering what people would bother to follow that guy on Twitter, and then would retweet that to THEIR audience of followers--it would be very active and vocal Democrats both who work for the party and who don't: 

https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/787369040750776320

The MSM echo-chamber (defined here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)) picked up the idea and AMPLIFIED it out to their readership, getting the politics-following public thinking about it: 

THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, the 2nd most-read paper in the country, and America's main "serious" newspaper (http://www.infoplease.com/ipea/A0004420.html) -

 "Drug testing?!?" tweeted former Obama aide David Axelrod. "You have to wonder if @HillaryClinton will/should reconsider next debate, given the depths to which this has sunk." (Axelrod was referring to a Trump quip from a Saturday speech.) Boston Globe columnist Michael Cohen also floated the idea to scrap next weeks third and final presidential debate, though he admitted "I offer this proposal with a rather large grain of salt."

<TEXT> Having listened to the show and read the key players' twitters for most of the year I think I have a pretty good list of who is voting for who. Now a lot of comedians deliberately sit on the fence and try not to say a definitive answer but they will also more readily damage control a particular candidate and/or attack one without talking about the other which makes them definitely lean one way. If someone calls Trump Hitler but says Hillary isn't that good either, obviously they're more likely to vote for Hillary. It's more accurate to say this is about which candidate they would rather vote for if they were forced too but that's not as interesting a title. Anybody I didn't list hasn't made a strong lean toward a candidate or I just forgot about. 

**Pro-Trump**

*Anthony Cumia

*Jim Norton

*Greg "Opie" Hughes (Last year he said he never would vote for a dynasty politician meaning both Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton. In addition he always seems to take Trumps side in political talks since he hates "the media" and "PC culture" as well.)

*Brother Joe

*Bobo

*Stalker Patti

*Bill Burr (Said while he doesn't like Trump he absolutely can't stand Hillary)

*Club Soda Kenny

*Keith the Cop

*Dennis Falcone (Said Trump would be good for small businesses which he is part of one)

*Vic Henley

*Theo Von

*Jim Florentine

**Pro-Clinton**

*Amy Schumer [who is actually related to NY Senator Chuck Schumer]

*Louis CK

*Judy Gold

*Ron Bennington (He asked on one of his recent shows why anyone would bother voting for Trump as he couldn't understand it)

*Jim Jefferies

*Colin Quinn (Said when asked his opinions on Trump or Hillary that Hillary was the more qualified candidate)

<TITLE> Trump's foreign policy is the Reaganite stance of "PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH," while Hillary's is BERSERK OVERCOMPENSATION: She'd INSTANTLY wage full-scale war in Syria to prove she's a "tough" woman. Notice the MSM never talks about HER and "the nuclear button"! She is NOT the peace candidate! -- </TITLE>

<TEXT> And after overthrowing Bashar al-Assad and leaving the 17 million people of Syria defenseless and at the mercy of ISIS, al-Nusra, and other terror gangs, she will try to "counterbalance" that massively destructive overseas aggression by inviting endless refugees into the U.S., which, OF COURSE, would also boost up the Democrat voter base. Yes, nothing but evil! That's why Trump called her the Devil right to her face! Think of the old proverb - to "tell the truth and shame the devil!" She SHOULD be ashamed of herself, as he repeatedly said! That's LONG overdue!

Just remember what former General Wesley Clark, who was also a Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, famously said about "7 countries in 5 years" - Iraq and Libya have now been destroyed, so there are still 5 others for "strongwoman" Hillary to "regime-change." (Here's the 2-minute video where he talks about it - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw) It's so SICKENING to consider, and FURTHERMORE, it's practically guaranteed that Bill would be Secretary of State, to keep the whole Foundation of favors going and growing bigger and bigger, as every industry and geographic area of the U.S. is sold to the highest bidder, just like all those embassy positions! (In case anyone forgot about or MISSED the news about that whole now-public series of "auctions" - http://archive.is/diiuK) 

**We really need to vote for Trump in droves and droves and NOT take November 8th for granted!!!!**

<TEXT> This is the stuff that people really want--and NEED--to know about. I had also checked the traffic for other names, including Sidney Blumenthal, Warren Buffett, George Soros, Deborah Wasserman Schultz, and Jonathan Gruber (economist), but the increase was not nearly as significant. The 4 numbers next to each name here represent the traffic for each article over the past 4 days (10/7 - 10/10). If the numbers increase yet again or remain as high, I'll update this and post it again tomorrow! *(Uncheck "Logarithmic scale") -*

<TITLE> USEFUL piece of history: Arnold Schwarzenegger, who just pathetically refused to endorse Trump, was accused of sexual harassment by 6 women in a scandal called "Gropergate," right before the 2003 CA recall election, and then he won in a 17-point landslide (and that was in CA!)  </TITLE>

As for all the politicians retracting their endorsements, who the hell bases their vote on what their senator or congressman says? Sorry, the American people are not that stupid. And as Trump has revealed to the public over and over again, **typical politicians are completely OWNED by the lobbyists, donors, and special interests** who they depend on to fund their re-election campaigns and their lavish lifestyles. This is just a list of typical run-of-the-mill politicians who don't want to lose that funding; this isn't about principle. As Trump said in one speech earlier this year, a politician can't even go to the bathroom without first asking their lobbyists.

**As for the Clinton campaign, we'll see what they have to say about these FAR more criminal allegations, which Trump has only HINTED at, as he is a COUNTER-PUNCHER, and now he's been brought to have this fight about who personally treats women better:**

<TEXT> I'm wondering who DIDN'T sell their soul to the devil, so to speak. Is there an easy to combine the lists and then separate who's only on the Bernie list vs. who's on BOTH? The only method I know would be to spend a few hours copying and pasting the names all into a color-coded list (a different color for who endorsed which of the two) and then alphabetizing them to see who's who. I'm sure there's a more efficient way to do it, though.

He's absolutely right! Hell, the leaked audio is just locker room banter or everyday guys talk, it's no big deal!

Like I said in another video - He talked shit with a buddy a decade ago like a typical man has... I'm sure I've said some shameful stuff in private with the guys before.  Anyway, Hillary is the one grabbing cunts in this race. 

He apologized and admitted he's said some wrong things. Hillary just places blame on everyone else.

What you said 11 years ago wasn't pretty but let's be real...I couldn't count the number of guys in my lifetime that I've heard utter similar, or much worse, comments. And frankly women do it about men, too. Admit it ladies. Hillary is trying to inflame the people who don't realize what's important for the country and distract us from her downright illegal and immoral actions of the past 40 years. A bit of locker room type braggadocio is meaningless in the grand scheme of things. I'm way more concerned about just how Hill and Bill made $40 million last year!!!!

He is a chess master. He released his own tax records so he could expose a tax loophole signed into law by Bill Clinton for his rich buddies. Now, he releases a tape of his "locker room banter" so he can expose Bill and Hillary Clinton about Bills rapes. Check and Mate!!
