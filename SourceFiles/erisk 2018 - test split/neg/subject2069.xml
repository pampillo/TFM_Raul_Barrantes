<TEXT> I don't think that was his point. 

Blind people have been known to use echolocation to play basketball, etc, IRL.

His point was that echolocation works by bouncing sound and, as he's not in the game, it's not like he could actually navigate to the ball by making noise. </TEXT>

If cock fighting and dog fighting are illegal, why should fox hunting be legal? It involves very little skill and is more just a grand day out for toffs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Man, that sucks.

Two questions (which may be wholly inappropriate):

1. Knowing that it's getting progressively worse, what would you aim to have your last sight as? I know it's gradual and not full site one minute, blind the next, but what is the last thing you want to see?

2. Are your other senses gradually getting better? Do you think you will cope better needing aids (came, guide dog, etc) compared to, say, someone who goes blind over night in an accident?

Fingers crossed for you that medical advances keep going the way they're going! 

Edit: fixed wording. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, not bad! Following some tutorials I've managed to make a functioning login page that requires a unique username, email verification, profile picture upload and video uploads! 

I can't begin to comprehend how I'd have done this without firebase's premade code!

The downside is that you pay per MB, or have to make do with the small monthly allowance. Eve. Testing my own code nuked the limit so I've had to sub in locally stored videos for the time being! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks a lot for that, that was very helpful.

Is making a custom backend difficult? I'm not even sure how it'd work. Is it practical to start with firebase then transition to custom or would that be a waste of time? 

What I'm thinking is, like snapchat stories, where you can sit and rewatch someone's story over and over, would that repeatedly increase the data usage and, therefore, the cost?

Thanks again. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How financially viable is firebase for a video sharing app? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-04 11:24:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all,

I'm working on an app that allows users to send videos.

As I'm new to coding (and learning swift as I go) I don't think it's feasible for me to also create a back end. For that reason, I'm using firebase.

As the app is still in it's infancy I have no idea of the financial viability of this.

Could a developer still make money off adverts on an app where firebase is used? Or would the cost per Mb outweigh that? 

Of course it depends on usage, but I'm talking in generalities here!

Thanks a lot. </TEXT>

One question I have is, once you have your app, how did you build a user base? Did you just stick it on the App Store and hope for word of mouth, or? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our puppy got crate trained within a week! As has been said above you need to make them want to go in the crate and make them enjoy it.

We don't give our dog his food until he goes and sits in his crate, then we shut the door while he eats then open it once he's done.

Also our crate is quite big, half is taken up by his bed and half is a folded towel with his toys in it. We've also folded a blanket over the bed side of the crate so it's like a cave so he can have privacy when he goes to bed, but he can go to the towel end when he wants to see out.

When we would first put him in we would sit on the floor just outside it so he could see we're not far away. Now his crate stays at the end of the living room where he has a clear view of us. 

Also, if you use clicker training a good technique is one of you hold your dog so it can't run, the other one excitedly call the puppy over and put tasty treats in the crate so the dog WANTS to go in, the person lets go, the dog excitedly goes in to get a treat, you click the clicker and praise him, then repeat! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I downloaded this on a whim yesterday as my neighbours came over and we were looking for something to do.  My neighbours typically go to bed fairly early (10ish), but we put this on for "one game" before they left and they ended up staying another 2 hours, leaving at midnight!

To sum up how it works, you press play on your chosen game mode and a 4 letter code appears. Every player then goes to jackbox.tv on any internet connected device and puts in the code and their name/icon. Your smart device then works as your buzzer/drawing pad, etc.  It's 2-8 players, and the mechanics of each game are different.

The game flows well and the announcer announces what you do very smoothly such that you feel like you could be watching an actual TV quiz show.

I looked at this game for a few days before deciding to take the plunge (20) but I'm glad I did. If you like cards against humanity, drinking games or general quizzes then I'd recommend this! </TEXT>

<TEXT> [update](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/abcnews.go.com/amp/US/school-shootings-columbine-numbers/story%3Fid%3D36833245) 

Better source - its cited as FBI records. 50 mass murders at a school post columbine, 270 (probably where the previous article cited 200+) shootings of any kind at a school.

My point, as aforementioned, is that after shooting 1 - why are there 49 more? 70% of those obtained guns from home where a family member owned it, so these aren't black market or illegal firearms.

1 mass school shooting is a tragedy; 2 is a failing of the government and the community to do something about it.

A massively simplified comparison: If a kid hits another kid with a stick - you take away the stick. You don't give both kids sticks to level the playing field. </TEXT>

The last school shooting (as far as I'm aware) we had in the UK was [dunblane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_school_massacre), which was 1996 and, as a result, we virtually banned private gun ownership and there hasn't been a school shooting since, and there's only been one (as far as I'm aware) mass shooting since, which was in Cumbria in 2010.

Whereas in the US there have been (at the time of this article) [over 200 school shootings](https://everytownresearch.org/school-shootings/) since 2013.

Obviously your country is bigger and there are a whole host of socio-economic factors at play, but it's ludicrous to an outsider that in the face of the huge gun crime problem you don't massively clamp down on guns.

Obviously, there are so many in circulation it's hard, but the key to combating that is imposing a tougher sentence for having a banned gun and having an amnesty. We had a school stabbing so the police held a [knife amnesty](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.independent.co.uk/news/police-knife-amnesty-nets-40000-weapons-1325322.html%3Famp) where 40,000 knifes/swords were handed in with no questions asked and no fear of reprisal.

Obviously this comment won't change anything, or even anyone's mind as opinions are fairly strong on this matter. I don't mean to sound like I'm trying to tell you what to do, either. I'm just concerned for the innocent children who get caught up in these tragedies! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I half agree but half think that he's in this situation because he valued his own sexual gratification above the safety and lives of others.

This man was a teacher so we can assume he was educated, he wasn't unaware of the consequences his proclivities would have on his victims.

I mean if I found out the only thing that turned me on was something directly detrimental to others, I.e. being a paedophile, id like to think I'd either go get help or just decide "oh well, that's me never getting turned on again."

At some point active paedophiles consciously make the choice to act on their urges and that is unforgivable.

There's a documentary about paedophiles who meet up and don't act on their urges and who seek help - that's what I imagine compassionate individuals who discover they like kids should do.  After all, liking kids isn't a choice anyone would make willingly, but acting on it (or not acting on it) is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was down to the last 4, I was last maf left, nobody suspected me at all. The medium seanced me to say all the dead were convinced I was Town and that played number 1 was maf and they gave me supporting (incorrect) reasons as to why.

To further bolster my standing as not being maf I passed on the mediums message.

Little did I know one of the remaining four was a spy who saw my night time conversation with the medium (or at least my side of it) so knew that I was maf. 

First time I've ever been caught with this. I won't make that mistake again!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> People can join IS in many forms other than travelling to the heart of IS country, presumably.  It's more commonplace when you see follow up news after they commit atrocities to see them say it was a splinter cell who did it, who received training and funding in other countries, not in the countries you'd typically associate with IS.

Plus, it's naive to assume no new people are getting in to the epicentre or IS - where there's a will, money and corruption, people will always be able to travel around.  It's why human trafficking is still happening, even in countries like the UK and the USA. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not that we wouldn't _want_ them to go out fighting - it's that there are more eventualities than them keeping living out there and then dying fighting out there.

It's the same reason lawyers and police offer reduced sentences and plea deals even when they know somebody has done something. 

The most dangerous people are those who have nothing to lose, so if people want rehabilitation and you categorically rule that out, it means anyone who has even just made a mistake and flown to a country to join Isis but who hasn't even yet picked up a gun or done anything hateful/terroristic has no way out and is left to see their mistake through. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As with other points people have made on this thread - I don't disagree with you, and I fully see the logic in your stance.

Unfortunately the reality is not so black and white. Not all IS fighters are front line jihadi "soldiers" and so they won't all be shot and an easily taken care of problem. There are tacticians, bomb makers, wives of jihadis who hold emotional sway over fighters, etc. If a bomb maker, for example, saw error in his way, he might prefer a "fair" sentence in an American jail followed by a life in the US post-jail as opposed to living out his days in Mosul. And one guy choosing to stop making bombs could theoretically save hundreds of lives.

As I said before, also in this thread, I also used to have such clear views in my head, however my life experience has taught me that if you don't bend and provide small allowances for things, then they break and completely fall apart. No stance is immune to criticism, no plan is infallible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a sane person, I agree completely. However some people are more easily swayed / disillusioned with life.

If we take the stance "anyone who has gone there instantly is blacklisted for death" then anybody thinking about quitting or informing on them etc will think "fuck it, I've got nothing to lose, I may as well stay here for life and go out fighting." </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, that's why people who go to prison get reduced sentences, plea deals, incentives for good behaviour, etc. If there were no incentives there would be no deterrents.  If governments don't bend, they break. I'm not saying that if people return they shouldn't be watched like a hawk, or if they committed proven atrocities while they were away they shouldn't be jailed - im saying that if, say, 10% of people who went to be jihadis went and changed their mind, wouldn't you rather they came back and we only had 90% to worry about? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Or because taking a hard line with those who return would discourage people returning and encourage more people to go join. It's a delicate balance.

It's like why people in jail get good behaviour rewards when, arguably, they're criminals and don't "deserve it". If you don't have a light at the end of the tunnel for people they're more likely to do fucked up shit without fear of ramifications. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Firstly, I love the joycon and have exclusively used that mode thus far, so your assertion that they're horrible is not universal.

Secondly, needing hardware to play a game on four player doesn't equate to that game costing more. As somebody else has pointed out that, if you're going that route, you'd also need to include the cost of the switch.

A similar example is "me and my friends wanted a kick about so I bought a football - but we then needed to all buy pairs of boots, shin guards and football strips! The cost of playing football is so high!" </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've only been about a month into it and I'm halfway through making an app. 

I can't remember their names, and I'll go dig them out if you struggle to find them, but there's an Asian American, and a South Korean guy who make tutorials that are great!

The first of the two doesn't really use the GUI and does everything code based, which was quite daunting for me! Especially if you make a mistake it's hard to know when you've gone wrong. The latter guy is very easy to follow IMO.

In fact I'm being lazy, I'll go get you their links.

Edit:

[The Swift Guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-d1NWv5IWtIkfH47ux4dWA) 

[Duc Tran](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvPFGq6luCqAVGiFpzTvkIA) 

[Jared Davidson](https://www.youtube.com/user/Archetapp) 

[Let's Build That App](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuP2vJ6kRutQBfRmdcI92mA) 

Between these 4 gents I've managed to learn quite a bit! If you're willing to put the time in to going through their tutorials you'll definitely pick stuff up.

I'd recommend starting with The Swift Guy or Jared as their tutorials are much more bite sized, Duc and LBTA are a bit longer and more advanced IMO. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah but this is the first Fully fledged RPG style Zelda. It fits the remit to reward exploration, and there's only so many unique items you can get (bombs, magnet, stasis), so there needs to be a system in place to keep things fresh.

You may disagree, which you're entitled to, but I think it's great. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's good and is essential to make finding weapons constantly important.

If you found a good weapon early on and it never broke you'd never need to bother getting another one.

Also, it makes me excited when I find a good one! Everything I had is ~20 damage then I found a 36 damage weapon! I then used it to kill a giant I randomly found wandering around. 

I'm loving this game! </TEXT>

<TITLE> How to select what data to download off of firebase? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-02 19:19:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys,

In a nutshell I have data stored on firebase than I want to randomly distribute, but in order of when it was submitted.  For example:

People upload data (let's say a voice clip), I want to set it so on the app there's a download button and when a user hits it it checks for the voice clip at the front of the queue, checks it's not uploaded by the current user, if not it downloads the voice clip and adds "1" to the counter, and once the counter reaches 5 the voice clip is then put into a waiting bay, pending all 5 users who downloaded it rating it, whereby an action is taken.

I ask this as I've just realised that all logic needs undertaken at the front end and not the back end, so I'm trying to implement the sorting of voice clips in line with the download button.

When a user uploads an audio clip I'm thinking of having firebase store:

1. The clip
2. Clip name
3. Date
4. User Unique ID number 
5. Username
6. Number of downloads (set to zero initially)
7.  Score

Is the best way to tell firebase to look for the oldest date? And then check that the user id doesn't equal current user idea, and then if a suitable clip is found +1 to number of downloads?

Any input to this very general question would be appreciated!

<TEXT> I 100% agree. I wasn't meaning compare Zelda to Nintendogs directly, I was meaning evaluate both games contextually and then tell me do you consider Nintendogs as good as ocarina of time? I'd say definitely not. 

Is goat simulator a 10 because it's the best goat simulation game there's ever been? Probably not. 

Did Nintendogs push boundaries, and will it be remembered for decades? Probably not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, but is Nintendogs literally the BEST it could physically be, aka 10/10? Is there zero scope for improvement?

A game like Zelda is much more open to interpretation as it has a story and gameplay elements.  A game as simple as Nintendogs - whilst still able to feasibly achieve a 10 would, in my opinion, have to do a lot more to be classed as perfect.

I'm not comparing Nintendogs to Zelda like for like, I'm saying look at Zelda whilst considering the boundaries of RPG/adventure games and look at Nintendogs within the context of its' genre - are both games equally as accomplished/pushing the boundaries? In my opinion - no.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-02-26 17:11:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I ordered from Tesco on day one of pre orders as they guaranteed release day delivery.

I just checked my order and it says releasing 6th of March so I phoned them. The guy on the phone said "yes, release day delivery - the console is dropping on the 6th of March."

I said "no, the console is dropping on the 3rd of March?" 

He said "no, we have a staff notice that Nintendo are dropping it on the 6th and they'll do an announcement on the 6th telling everyone."

I said "I highly doubt they're pushing the release date back 3 days and aren't telling anyone until 3 days after the fact. Plus amazon, Argos, etc all still say the third."

He said "oh well there's nothing more I can tell you than what it says here."

What it looks like is that Tesco want to ensure release day delivery so they've just created their own release date, 3 days after Nintendos actual release date.  I'm going to be left with BoTW and no console to play it on.

TL:DR; Tesco can eat a great big bowl of dicks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree. Look at the company who made witcher, they started with a lesser budget, lesser renown and a lesser fan base and look at the games they produced.

Pokmon have the budget, the fan base and the means to make an amazing game. It's just a question of whether or not they can be bothered.

Also, the switch functioning as a handheld gives them an "out" to just give it the same graphics as they give their previous Pokmon games. 

I doubt if we see a Pokmon game that it'll be much different than existing Pokemon games. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thats true about their origin, but my point is that he (Trump) is doing this under the guise of trying to prevent another 9/11, yet he isn't touching the countries who perpetrated it.

Also, as this is an executive order he didn't need to pick the same countries Obama has looked at, it's not like Trump is one for towing the line.

He's clearly just trying to look like he's doing something, whilst not effecting the richer Arab nations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for your input! 

They said it's to keep numbers down! I'm not annoyed at my friend, and I'm certainly not hurt, I just feel it's a huge ask for me to go solo when it'll cost so much, and possibly hurt my gf's feelings.

Also, I already booked the double hotel room when I thought I had a plus one, so the groom thinks I'm coming so if I now send the confirmation back with "I will not be attending" after he's told me I don't have a plus one I don't want it to seem spiteful!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They said it was to limit numbers they only invited plus ones they've met or know quite well!

They've met my girlfriend twice, like 6 years apart, so they know we've been together at least that long.

As I said to somebody above, it's their special day so they can and can't invite who they like, but I agree with you, we've been together long enough that she could realistically be my wife. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do agree with you and have personally ran through that train of thought in my head, but when I did the counter arguments I came up with myself were:

1. Yes, weddings are expensive. But the main expense is the venue, the rings, the cake, the band, etc. None of which get more expensive per guest. The additional cost for having plus ones there would be that of the meal, which they'll more than make back in wedding gifts. Plus, I guarantee it'd cost me a lot more for me and my girlfriend to go, than it'd cost them to have us there.

2. I do 100% agree it's their day and their rules, I have no hard feelings at all that my girlfriend isn't invited, I'm just trying to figure out if I should still go despite that. There'd be absolutely no love lost between me and my friend even if I don't go (on my end, anyway)!

3. I guess yes, I can physically afford the grand it'll cost. It would have to come out of my savings and will be a Grand I don't spend on something else, however. I had no qualms with paying the grand (I've already prebooked double rooms at the hotel and meals, when I assumed I had a plus one), but I just can't justify going myself I don't think! At least if me and my SO could make a long weekend of it, it'd be like a nice weekend for us too, justifying the spend.

4. Me and my gf have been together 8 years and lived together for, like, 5. I'm pretty sure that's longer/more than the bride and groom at this wedding. Not inviting my gf would be like not inviting someone's wife. Even if she wouldn't say it I think it would hurt my GF's feelings if I went.

<TEXT> It's not like a wedding abroad, but the hotel is ~ $160 a night, and it would be two nights. Travel there would be $100, alcohol and food would be expensive, wedding gift would be expensive, etc.

And yeah, I got the save the date in a postcard form so it just had my name on it, but I assumed that was because it was a post card and you don't typically address post cards to two people. However, my actual invite came later and it just had my name on it so I asked my friend and he confirmed it was limited numbers and just me invited. </TEXT>

Thanks a lot, man!  I have it working.  What I did was:

       // Adds observer to watch for a change of user defaults
        NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(userDefaultsDidChange), name: UserDefaults.didChangeNotification, object: nil)
    }
    
    func viewWillDisappear()
    {
        NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(self, name: UserDefaults.didChangeNotification, object: nil)
    }
    
    
    func userDefaultsDidChange()
    {
        print("user defaults did change.")
        upScore = UserDefaults.standard.object(forKey:"thumbsUpScore") as! Int
        downScore = UserDefaults.standard.object(forKey:"thumbsDownScore") as! Int
        let upScoreUpdate = ("\(upScore)") // Makes upScore a new parameter of type string for setting the button title
        thumbsUpButton.setTitle(upScoreUpdate, for: .normal) // Sets button title
        let downScoreUpdate = ("\(downScore)") // Makes downScore a new parameter of type string for setting the button title
        thumbsDownButton.setTitle(downScoreUpdate, for: .normal) // Sets button title
    }

<DATE> 2017-02-04 00:01:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys,

To boil my example down to its most basic form, I have two view controllers:

VideosViewController.Swift
VideoView1.Swift

In VideoView1.Swift I have a thumbs up button, when I press it once a variable called "upScore" changes to 1, when I press it again it changes back to 0.  After upScore updates, it is made into a UserDefault:

UserDefaults.standard.set(upScore, forKey:"thumbsUpScore")

What I want to do is have a UIlabel on VideosViewController display the current score in real time.  I guess what I need for this is the notifications centre to observe for changes in the user default?  Is that correct?  If so, how would I go about implementing this?  I've done a fair bit of googling but no results after roughly 2012 show UserDefaultsDidChange.  Has this been superseded?

Thanks very much, any help is appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Picador, 

Thanks so much for responding.  This is what I've implemented - and it is working as I hoped - is this what you had in mind?

class VideoView1: UIViewController, DataSentDelegate {

    var player1 = AVPlayer()

And then later.......

    func playVideo()
    {
        let videoURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/Volumes/Mac HDD/Users/Pinchy/Documents/App/Ripple/Ripple/5secvid.mp4")
        player1 = AVPlayer(url: videoURL)


So I define player as a variable outside of any functions, but then give it a specific value within a function later?

Thanks again! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-01-28 20:15:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey all. 

In the image attached I have two functions - one which houses and starts a video playing, before looping it.

Another, which is a delegate that receives a variable called "data" which receives some information.

I want to use "data" to pause / play the video, however the video is defined in one function, and the "data" parameter is in a separate function, so they're oblivious to one another.

What is the best way to go about getting "player" in the scrollViewDidScroll?

Sorry I didn't get back to you earlier; I just got back to my computer and what you suggested seems to be working!!!

https://imgur.com/a/dsDhT (homelessness donation)

My confusion was that I thought I had to go to the receiving view controller and make it a delegate there, but from what you've showed me, I need to preemptively specify in the sending view controller what the receiving view controller is called?  Is that right? 

I would never have figured this out without you, so thanks very much for your time and persistence!

I may have more questions in future, so watch this space!!

<TEXT> Thanks for the response!  Firstly, I did try.  If I try:

videosScrollView.delegate = self 

I get "use of unresolved identifier videosScrollView."

If I try:

VideosViewController.delegate = self 

I get "instance member 'delegate' cannot be used on type 'VideosViewController'."

I get your point, but can I use the debugger when I don't actually have any error?  I understand that the delegate is nil so no information is carried, but it's due to my lack of familiarity with the delegate method that I can't figure out what to do next, would the debugger tell me any more than I already know in this instance?

I've found tutorials online and followed several, but they *all* entail carrying data to another view controller as you move to that view controller using segue or prepare to segue.  This is where I'm lost as I don't know what I should do in the place of this.

I do think the metaphor you've cited is apt, but through tutorials and reading online I've managed to go from zero coding experience to a semi functional app that does what I want (even if the code is bastardised, but that's to be expected for a beginner), building this app is in itself the learning, not a shortcut to the end result.  

I'll keep plodding on!  Thanks for your help so far! </TEXT>

Just wondering specifically what you mean by assign something to it?  Sorry, I'm not familiar with Swift lingo too well (yet)!

Are you saying I need to add:

**mainViewController.delegate = self**

to the function on the subview (the one I'm sending the data to)? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks I'll definitely give this a try after work too! It's scrolling width-wise, so I'll use that. 

Is pause a universal command? Even though the AVPlayer is on page 1, can I just tell it to pause from the view controller that houses the scroll view?

It would be helpful if I can get my head round delegates as I have a thumbs up and down button in front of the scroll view, so I need Interactions with the main view controller to pass the "like" or "dislike" data to whatever sub view is active! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the detailed answer - I'll try this tonight!

I did suspect that was doing nothing because I tried to print delegate on the view controller and it said delegate was nil!

How do I assign something to the delegate? I'll have a look online in the mean time, but if you have more time to answer that'd be appreciated!

Thanks!

Edit:

Just to clarify, are you saying I need to change the code on the sub view to:

SUB VIEW (XIB FILE) 

import UIKit 
import AVKit 
import AVFoundation 
import Firebase 

class VideoView1: UIViewController, DataSentDelegate { 

func scrollViewDidScroll(data: CGFloat) 
  { 
  **mainViewController.delegate = self**
  print("I'm on subview and Page: (data)") 
  } 
}

<TEXT> Okay, so:  What I have is a view controller that has a UIScrollView and 2 sub views which can be scrolled between.  One subview has a video in it.  I have a variable in my main view controller called "Page" which stores what page is scrolled to at the moment, either 0 or 1 (for subview 1 or 2).

I'm trying to use protocol and delegate to carry this variable "page" to the sub view such that I can pause the video on sub view 1 if page = 1, but play it if page = 0.  

My code is:

VIEW CONTROLLER:

import UIKit 
import AVFoundation
protocol DataSentDelegate 
{ 
func scrollViewDidScroll(data: CGFloat) 
}

class VideosViewController: UIViewController, UIScrollViewDelegate {

var delegate:DataSentDelegate?

@IBOutlet weak var videosScrollView: UIScrollView!

override func viewDidLoad() 
{
    super.viewDidLoad()
    videosScrollView.delegate = self
}

func scrollViewDidScroll(_ scrollView: UIScrollView) 
{ 
let width = scrollView.frame.size.width 
let page = scrollView.contentOffset.x / width
   
 // If whole number
    if page.truncatingRemainder(dividingBy: 1) == 0
    {
    // Print page number
    print("Page: \(page)")
    }
    // Pass required data to delegate
    delegate?.scrollViewDidScroll(data: page)
}


SUB VIEW (XIB FILE)
import UIKit 
import AVKit 
import AVFoundation 
import Firebase
class VideoView1: UIViewController, DataSentDelegate 
{
func scrollViewDidScroll(data: CGFloat) {
print("I'm on subview and Page: \(data)")
 }
}

Where I run my app and scroll between screens the console gives me the printed info from the view controller, i.e. "Page: 0" and "Page: 1" etc, but it isn't printing any info from the sub view, which suggests I've not set this up right and my data isn't carrying through to the sub view.

Can you see any obvious reasons as to why?

Sorry if that's not clear, I've cut out a lot of code that isn't relevant to what I'm trying to implement here!

Thanks again.

*Edit: I've seen a few tutorials that use delegates/protocols but they also require prepareforsegue, which isn't any use for me here* </TEXT>

<TEXT> I realise 5 isn't a lot, but for somebody who is competent with swift I imagine this should only take you a few minutes to puzzle out!

Essentially, I'm trying to pass a variable from my view controller that houses UIScrollView to the subview shown in the scroll view every time the user scrolls.  

I'm fairly certain I've got it 90% set up, I must just be doing something stupid!

Thanks very much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey man,

Sorry to bother you.  My code has no errors, but it just doesn't seem to be passing the information that I require - can you spot anything obviously wrong with my code?

*View controller*

import UIKit
import AVFoundation

protocol DataSentDelegate
{
    func scrollViewDidScroll(data: CGFloat)
}

class VideosViewController: UIViewController, UIScrollViewDelegate {
    
    // Added Delegate.  Put question mark to make it optional as we might not yet have a delegate.
    var delegate:DataSentDelegate?
    
    // Scroll View Definition
    @IBOutlet weak var videosScrollView: UIScrollView!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        videosScrollView.delegate = self
        
    }

 func scrollViewDidScroll(_ scrollView: UIScrollView) {
        let width = scrollView.frame.size.width
        let page = scrollView.contentOffset.x / width

        // If whole number
        if page.truncatingRemainder(dividingBy: 1) == 0
        {
        // Print page number
        print("Page: \(page)")
        }
        // Pass required data to delegate
        delegate?.scrollViewDidScroll(data: page)
    }


*Sub view (XIB FILE)*

import UIKit

class VideoView1: UIViewController, DataSentDelegate {

    func scrollViewDidScroll(data: CGFloat)

Can you see any obvious reasons as to why?

Do I need to use prepare for segue?  The tutorial I've found has a step for that, but I'm not actually segueing anywhere?

Could you elaborate further please on what you mean?  I don't understand.

Do both the view controller (which houses the scrollview) and the subview (xib file) need to conform? 

At the moment just the view controller does using 

self.scrollControllerName = delegate

How could I achieve this on the xib view which doesn't have a scroll view?

<TEXT> Hi!

If I have a view controller with a UIScrollView on it, and the scroll view can scroll between two xib subviews, what is the best way to deal with videos on the subviews?

At the moment I have code on the view controller that identifies which sub view is currently displayed, and on the sub views I have the code for AVplayerlayer. 

What I want to do is play or pause the videos depending on if they're currently being viewed. However in the subview I don't seem to have access to scrollViewDidScroll, and I don't have access to the video player controls within the main view controller (as they're on the subview) so there is a disconnect in what I'm trying to do!

Any help or guidance would be appreciated! I feel like I'm very close in achieving what I want to do, I've just hit this frustrating hurdle!! </TEXT>

Here I was hoping he was town and would tell on me OR that there was a spy.

Two seconds later spy types up everything I said, so I said he's lying and must be exe, etc. I get put on the stand day one but I argue he could be BMer (after he passed spy test) too well and half the town believe me or think I'm jester so inno. 

Night 2 actual BMer dies so everyone is like "So Jeb is the spy!! So John is bad!!" And I get put on the stand again, just keep typing "I am blackmailed." Even though the blackmailer was jailed the night before. Everyone starts calling me an idiot saying I can't be blackmailed and to hang me. The whole town voted guilty!

<TEXT> When I was young (10 or 11) there was a poor family who let their kids do whatever they wanted, they were out as late as they wanted, didn't eat healthy food, their house was a state, etc.  They were also always in trouble at school, never doing their homework, the boy took his pet cat to school in a lunchbox to show everybody, etc.

I can't remember how it started but the boy and girl (Andy and Debbie) came to my house and played with my toys and my mum made them food. This happened several times over a small period of time, but eventually they stopped coming.

Anyway, fast forward 10 years or so and it turns out Debbie had lured a mentally handicapped girl to her apartment, her and her boyfriend beat her up and stabbed her to death and cut off her limbs with knives and wrapped her body in a sleeping bag and hid it in the cupboard.

They got caught and she went to jail.

I'm sort of torn because she's always been an arsehole, but I'm sure a lot of that is down to not being raised properly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But you're insinuating that all legal gun owners are law abiding citizens? I listened to a podcast about a guy in a bad part of town who was unemployed and made money by legally buying guns for people with chequered criminal records who couldn't buy their own.

Also, you say research is required into causes of violence, but there will always be violence, sometimes without cause. And the easier it is for these violent people to obtain guns, the more devastating the result on everyone else.

You're right, it'd be difficult to implement any meaningful change with so many guns already in circulation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My friend moved to Calgary from Scotland and lost his truck downtown for 3/4 months. He wasn't used to the size or layout of the city (compared to Scottish cities) and forgot where he parked completely.

On a whim one day he phoned a couple of impound places and one said they had it and they were going to get rid of it the next day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For anyone wondering I got to the bottom of this using:

UserDefaults.standard.set(input.text, forKey: "username")

I set the above code to the push of a button, making what text was in the "input" text box globally accessible.

I then went to the view controller I needed the label to appear and called the userdefault text string.

Much easier than what I previously tried to do by pushing the text to each view controller in turn with the segue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you're missing the point, someone asking if you're high is just pointing out that they know you're high.  It's much more friendly than saying "I know you're high."

It's contextual - I doubt at a party anyone would go about asking people if they're high or drunk, but in everyday normal life if you suspected your friend of being high or drunk you might ask them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It does sound like you need a hobby. 

Spending all day with your kids (depending their ages) is probably rewarding but not stimulating you socially if they're too young to talk, etc.

Your job has you around people but again probably isn't the most stimulating in terms of conversation or letting you be yourself.

I would suggest you try join a sports team, or do a night school class once a week or something similar just to get you around others where you can just be you.

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks a lot! I figured out a way earlier today with AVAudioPlayer but it doesn't seem like the most optimised solution so I'll look at what you're suggesting tomorrow!

I have 4 buttons on the bottom of my app to navigate (imagine like twitter) so on every view controller there's the same four buttons that need the same noise. So I need to programme the same noise to various buttons!

I'm new to this, but given how efficient the drag and drop interface seems to be thus far, and how it subsequently converts movements to code, I'm surprised adding audio to a button isn't also just drag and drop! If only...

Thanks a lot for your input, very much appreciated! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Again, I agree with you, but seeing how even unique girls are great and another one comes along is true in life post-education too! Hope that realisation doesn't stop you settling down in the long term!

And I'm the same, about a month before exam time at university I would go cold turkey from seeing my girlfriend and friends to study all day every day! I managed to get a first class degree whilst managing to slack for a lot of the year!

Personally if I could change something about my university experience I don't think I would! As much as I loved it I don't even think I'd relive it if given the chance as those intense study sessions were a pain in the arse! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see your point but I disagree that that's universally sound advise! What if you meet someone you're crazy about? 

Plus lots of partners wouldn't impose on your freedom! 

In university I had one girlfriend for a few months, dumped her, was single for a year or so, then met my current girlfriend and was with her for the rest of my university time and still am, that's been 7 years!

My first girlfriend tried to control me and was the fun police. When I was single I had loads of fun and accumulated typical crazy college style stories. The only difference between being with my current gf and being single at uni was sleeping with other people. I could still go out drinking with the lads whenever I wanted and not need to ask "permission" or I could come in at 5am half naked with a stolen sign post etc and she wouldn't care. Having a GF doesn't need to change your college experience if you have the right GF.

TL;DR; having a girlfriend and having fun at college aren't mutually exclusive if your girlfriend is sound. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not that humans care more about cats, it's just that:

A. Animals act on instinct, not malice, so if your cat did something humans deem as "bad" then beating it is unfair and doesn't accomplish anything.

B. The cat was not involved in your girlfriends infidelity.  So beating it shows the beater to be an immoral human.  Beating women is obviously bad, but the reason courts even consider crimes of passion is because the capacity for those exist in humans. Seeing your girlfriend cheat and running off and smashing her cat is calculated and cruel. </TEXT>

Say you wait 6 tables in an hour and each tips you this universal minimum, you've just made $30/hour. If you did this minimum each hour, not including your base salary, you'd be getting 60k a year. Obviously in some restaurants they split tips, but also on average I'm sure you'd do more than 6 tables and if this was the universal minimum you'd also get more from most customers, so the $30/hour figure isn't too far off.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Disagree with you on many fronts here:

1.  Tipping isn't a big thing here in the U.K. And our cost of eating out is pretty in line with yours, so I doubt paying a little more would push prices up. Yes, if just one restaurant tried to pay more they'd try push their prices up to compensate. But if the whole system changed and did it, as soon as one restaurant tried to push their prices up then people would just eat elsewhere. 

Plus, if you're expecting like 20% tips then there's a pretty big margin there for food to get more expensive and cost the consumer no more than they're paying anyway.

2. Good / bad service shouldn't mean your reward is scaled. If you're good at your job the reward should be keeping your job, if you're fundamentally bad at your job, you probably shouldn't have that job. 

Also, your point that it creates accountability isn't true where the culture is also such that you're expected to tip regardless. Bad service should = no tip if this were to work. I had a post in /AskReddit about tipping and one guy said even when he gets poor service he feels too guilty to not tip.

<TEXT> Yeah I'm Scottish. The process was alright, actually. I tried to get a place like 2 years ago and was turned down because I had no credit history - I.e. I'd never been in debt in my life, which means they were unsure if I'd be able to handle debt. It's quite silly as having never been in debt, it should show that I can handle my finances. So I bought a motorbike on credit and paid it off over a year to raise my credit rating. After that I had to make sure I had a deposit (10% of mortgage value) + 3k for lawyers fees etc, then I was good to go. Saw one place I fell in love with, shmoozed the seller a bit, put in an offer and negotiated for her to leave a lot of furniture and here I am a year later!

Interest rate at the moment here is quite low, I got mine at 2.7%. I took a 30 year mortgage and repayments are initially weighted as a lot more interest than actual repayments, but if I overpay by 40% or so every month it'll bring my mortgage down by 15 years, so I sit that extra money aside every month to make sure nothing crops up (like redundancy!) and then pay it at the end of each year, or so the plan is.

Yeah, all my previous flats I rented have been white walled, beige carpeted ones too. The week I got my keys myself and my girlfriend came in and stripped all the wallpaper and painted the shit out of the place! I also tried my hand at building a big (8 metre +) flower planted in the back garden!

<TEXT> Yeah, I love it! I rented with a friend before so it was fun having a room mate, but I was paying 400 a month rent and trying to save 1000 a month towards an apartment - now I own a place I just need to pay my mortgage (which is essentially money in the bank, minus the large interest) and save a lot less!

Also, it's fun being able to paint it decorate however you want! And just knowing you own a home is pretty nice!

I lost my job like 3 months after I got my flat, so that was a tiny bit stressful but I got a new one pretty quickly so that was lucky - would've been screwed if I couldn't get one in the longer term!

I'd say the pros are everything except that it sort of ties you down and means you need a recurring income for the next 25/30 years without exception, which is quite daunting!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, a question:

If you could get paid, say, $15 an hour but nobody tipped, or $2 an hour but you had to rely on tips - which would you choose? 

And I do agree completely with what you're saying. It just seems like when you're saying "when you tip you need to factor in how hard I work, how hard chefs work, how hard bartenders work" the phrase "when you tip" should be substituted for "when your employer pays you" - in literally every other job and industry your paid based/promoted based on your effort and typically harder/better workers earn more. 

Also, the service industry is one of the only industries where tipping in generally expected. 

Why is it that a server deserves a tip for doing their job but a cashier at a store doesn't, or your garbage man doesn't, etc? Other than saying your wages are low, which is surely your employers responsibility, not your customers?

Not arguing, by the way, just trying to get a servers thoughts on these things! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the informative and balanced answer!

Don't get me wrong, I do think American servers should get good tips (in U.K. they earn the same wages as everybody else in similar industries so it's not so vital here), but it was specifically the percentage thing I was asking about.  From your example above it sounds like you deserved $30+ tip. But say you were generally happy with 20% tips, in your above example 20% would have still only been $16 for 5 hours for 2 people, aka $1.60 per person per hour. Shouldn't tips just be a lump sum based on performance, effort, time etc, it shouldn't factor in what the customer specifically ate or drank (except quantity, which again would come under time and effort)?

Also, I'm sure you are lovely, but when servers always mention how they ask about people's day, ask how they are, etc - that's just common courtesy, something I've done in every job I've ever had and in general life. You shouldn't feel that you should be reimbursed for talking to your customers? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I semi see where you're coming from, except yeah, it's the customers who foot the bill - plus, your analogy is slightly off as a good salesman will bring in customers and maximise sales - it's not like servers are outside the restaurant roping you in, and other than dessert or sides it's not like they up-sell:

"I'll have a burger"
"Are you suuuuure you don't want the lobster and caviar?"

It just seems so weird to me that servers can be annoyed at customers for not supplementing their income as opposed to being annoyed at their employer for paying them $2 an hour. 

Plus, even then, what's the minimum wage in America (I honestly have no idea, let's assume it's $8). So if you serve 6 customers in an hour and each tipped $1, you'd be up at earning minimum wage - why do servers assume they should earn much more than that? Is being a server a massively more complex/difficult job than comparable minimum wage jobs such as grocery store employee, a cleaner, etc?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I completely get that - my question is specifically related to gauging a "good" vs "bad" tip as a percentage of your customers spend.

Like, say you spent ten mins on two customers where one had a much more expensive meal but both customers tipped $10. Would you be annoyed at the guy who had the expensive meal if that wasn't a high percentage of his total bill? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was listening to a podcast today and it had some waitresses who were annoyed their customers were "only" tipping 15%. 

It got me thinking - that's a completely arbitrary scale to go by? Like whether a guy orders a $50 steak or a $5 omelette or whatever, your job as a server involves saying hi, asking what he wants, taking it to him and saying bye - why do you feel you deserve $10 from steak guy and $1 from omelette guy (provided you're happy with 20% tip) for the exact same service? 

Of course it might be a gauge of how well off the customer is financially, or just what they fancied eating that day, but again, none of that is your concern as a server? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course it is. A 10 stone guy trying to get to 9 stone is a lot more difficult (in terms of exercise and diet required) than a 30 stone guy trying to get to 29 stone. 

As somebody said above, you pretty much have to go out your way to consume this many calories and not exercise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly. Especially as, for someone her size, walking about it essentially 10x more strenuous than it is for someone who isn't morbidly obese. Her muscles have to work harder, she burns more calories doing little things than someone much smaller.

The guy saying that it's a misconception that exercise causes weight loss is most definitely wrong. Yes, diet  exercise. But, as I said, provided her diet doesn't change to compensate, doing any exercise she doesn't currently do, with result in weight loss. To be at her current weight her body requires X amount of calories - Y amount of exercise, so if X remains the same and Y increases her net weight reduces. </TEXT>

There's no one governing body of flags, so theres no actual body or institution you're taking a stance against, so it accomplishes nothing (in my opinion).  I guess I view it as quite a petulant act. Like burning a football strip because your team lost.

Back to my earlier example - if I received an unjustly high phone bill, I'd rather contest the phone company, see a lawyer, go to citizens advice, etc, than I would burn my phone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes but the problem with a man with a gun on his hip is that that man can snap and carry out these attacks, a society where guns aren't readily available makes it much harder.  

What do you mean by gun free zone? Like a campus? The issue there is that people typically buy or carry their gun from outwith the gun free zone and meander into the gun free zone. So I don't really think that adds any credence to your point. It's like saying the majority of speeding tickets happen in lower speed zones that have just come from a higher speed zone, therefore you shouldn't enforce a speed limit because people still speed.

I can debate all day with you but I doubt either of us will change the others mind, plus I have no vested interest in this as I live in a relatively gun (and gun crime) free country.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> ?? Nice one. By that logic, you've used the word "the" a fair few times - was that on today's word of the day calendar? Deflection aside, you still didn't respond to my point? What about every other mass shooting where the perpetrator still has time to kill/injure multiple individuals before the police/an armed civilian can intervene? I'd argue you only need your police armed because your civilians are armed, and even then armed civilians do more harm than good.

Well without those statistics your point is conjecture.

<TEXT> It doesn't say he wasn't out to hurt anyone. Also, your point is moot as there's loads of American mass shootings where, despite the abundance of guns, the response is much longer and scores of people are injured/killed. Just because all your police carry guns it doesn't mean they can physically travel any faster than anywhere else. 

Where I live the police station had a lock up with guns but nobody carries them, if there's an incident the police in the station get them and head to the scene - these are the same police who'd respond to a crime where guns aren't needed. The only difference is they don't carry them in perpetuity. </TEXT>

I've been allocated two seven year old boys but have no idea what kids that age are into.  The only information you're provided is their name, gender and age - nothing to help make gifts more specific!

Any help would be appreciated.

You have two options:

1. Tell him in advance, and if he bails, it'd have never worked out anyway?

2. Tell him after a few days but then you run the risk of him bailing once you've grown attached.  But you may change his attitude to trans people in the process!

I don't understand making a post to tell people you're going to kill yourself, it seems like a cry for help more than anything. I can't talk for your life or trauma you've been through, but for me, if the choice was ANYTHING I could try, or giving up, I'd try something new. Unless you're claiming to have tried every possible thing you can, them you're just throwing in the towel early.

A lot of people are asking why his post says he's from Arizona but everything else suggests UK - it's his attempt at a joke. He's implying our city is shit (hence "shitsville") and he's writing it in the format of city, state. Arizona seems like an arbitrary pick. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He came back and applied to go on benefits*, was awarded a cheque for 1p in benefits (1 cent for our American friends) and complained to the local newspaper who wrote an article about how he can't afford to eat/buy food.

He forgot to make his facebook private and the local public found it and had a field day, the pitch forks were out in full force, hilarity ensued.

*note: he's a teacher in England but is waiting for his qualifications to transfer to Scotland - there's nothing stopping him getting a job in the meantime. Also, he lives with his mum who is very well off (millionaire), so he really doesn't need the benefits.

Also, I used to work with him at a supermarket when I was a student, somebody was having a leaving do in the local restaurant (think Nando's/Olive Garden), and he paid a stripper to come in the middle of the day, when the place was full of kids/families.  

He's genuinely crazy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not from hell but pretty inconvenient:

Turned night into day to play online games - would literally be walking about in his dressing gown ready for bed as I was getting up for uni. As I was going to bed he was sitting eating cereal. 

Would laugh MANIACALLY at whatever he was watching on his computer while gaming. Since he turned night into day it typically meant there was mad scientist laughter emanating from his room as I tried to sleep.

Broke the front door lock at 7am and woke me up to tell me to sort it and that he was going to bed. Leaving me locked IN my own flat with no way out.

When locked in wiped his arse with a tea towel and put the shitty tea towel in the washing machine. I asked why and he said "what else was I going to use!?" Uhhh, like the biggest commodity we have as students - paper?!

He was having a flat party so I moved my PS3 and tv into my bedroom so it didn't break, I also bought and hadn't opened the new assassins creed game at the time. I went to work and came home to find him in my room, having opened the game and pretty far through it, I saw spoilers and never played it again.

Had a French girlfriend and moved her in for months at time and they'd go take romantic hour long baths together, even though it was a communal student flat and we had one bathroom.

Think that's about it. </TEXT>

And what's the long term game plan? Eventually marry one, or just keep this going for the foreseeable future? 

How did your boyfriend take it when you first broached the subject? 

Did you want to be poly, THEN found your girlfriend? Or did you want to be poly because you wanted her specifically to be your girlfriend?

Is there any jealousy from either of your partners?

Thanks again! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Was swimming with 2 guy mates at the beach while drinking when I was 16. Current was stronger than we thought and when we realised we were much further from shore than we thought. We started trying to get back in, frantically swimming, realising we were struggling.

With some persistence me and friend A realised we'd made it through the tip tide but friend B was struggling to stay afloat and wasn't going to make it.

I said to friend A let's go back for friend B (friend B was my best friend at the time). We were just keeping B afloat when A said "swim away from the rocks  in the middle of the water, they're sharp"! I said "wait! Swim towards the rocks" and the three of us climbed onto them, shredding our feet, where we waited for the tide to calm down.

Like 3 years later friend B (who I saved) slept with my girlfriend and I only found out cause he filmed it and was showing off the tape  </TEXT>

I've noticed something weird, that Donald trump genuinely speaks to his supporters like parents speak to children, everything is dumbed down and repeated several times, and there's so much theatrics to his speeches, it all comes across as very disingenuous to me. I think that's what puts me off him first and foremost. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be fair, though, he has been bankrupt 4 times - in politics he won't be able to just wash his hands of errors and hope it blows over. Things he says or does wrong will have a lasting effect on vast swathes of the population.

And I think there's a difference between using leverage in a business sense to get what you want and having some decorum. Saying he can run a country because he can run a business is like saying Obama can now run a multi million dollar business because he's been president - it's apples and oranges.

I would say trump is lucky the visit went well, and it's presumably because of the good graces of the president of Mexico, after saying all he has said about Mexicans, building the wall, etc, another world leader may have perhaps been less forgiving and hospitable. Some things, once said, can't be taken back, and certain world leaders would perhaps be less amiable if trump were to openly insult them or their people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Firstly, thanks for the balanced and logical response - these sorts of topics very quickly seem to become heated!

I'm not sure I agree that trumps problems come from a lack of experience because, let's not forget, he has a team of experts helping him run this race.

I can't argue with your points about Hillary because as little as I know about trump, I know even less about her.

I just think to be president you need to have tact, patience and empathy, however trump is brash, impulsive and inflammatory. 

Was trump your first choice from the start, or is he just the best of a bad bunch? </TEXT>

Do you really want a president who does things that you have to say "he's new to this and is learning as he goes"?

I don't know, I'm still not convinced. 

From an outsider prospective he's just a brash businessman who says whatever he wants to gain public opinion but then openly contradicts himself to gain the other half of the public later. He's like a plate spinner running around telling whatever lie he's need to to stay popular.

Just be yourself, really. To get a one night stand with someone out of your league there's perhaps an elaborate combination of words you need to throw together to lure them in, but for dating, any act you put on now is one you need to continue for the length of the relationship.

That is to say, if you're yourself and they're not keen, then the relationship wouldn't have worked anyway.

That being said, someone can be out of your league in many ways: attractiveness, socially, financially, etc. So whatever metric you regard yourself as lacking in, just ensure that you bolster yourself in other areas. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a heterosexual male (and I'm white, the tumblr hated trifecta!) so this has never been an issue for me, but before joining Reddit I didn't really know it was an issue for anyone.

However, after trawling through /creepyPMs I've realised that this is a pretty prolific problem.  To that end, I'm generally pretty curious as to what goes through a guy's mind to decide to do this, and to understand if the sexual gratification comes from the sending of the pic, or the hopes of receiving something in return?

Furthermore, is this a one way issue? If guys suddenly became inundated with pictures of girls tits would they care? Is this why it's perhaps difficult for some males to understand the intrusiveness of what they're doing?

TL:DR - I'm just curious why people send unsolicited pics of their junk to other people. </TEXT>

For me it's the depth that does it.  I love the theories, and for there to be enough scope for people to have hundreds of theories, there needs to be  hundreds of fleshed-out characters, motivations, hints scattered throughout, etc.  And this is a thing GRRM is great at.

I love that I've not read the series in months, but I'm still thinking about it, wondering.   </TEXT>

But a HUE white only bulb and hue tap. You permanently leave the power on but can turn it in and off from your smartphone. That way the fan would stay on and the light could either be on or off independently. 

Not your cheapest solution, but workable. Also, you may like hue bulbs and end up getting more or coloured ones.

<TEXT> As someone who has invested in real estate and whose property has increased in value I wholeheartedly disagree with you.

Also, you're speaking about the housing market requiring some foresight of the future, yet you're advising him to put his money in the stock market? That's ludicrous.  You also said earlier that a 19 y/o would have no knowledge of buying property or of house maintenance, yet you're advising he invests.

The bottom line is OP will always need a place to live, it's what the majority of the population goes to work to be able to afford. If he gets a gaff now then he's in the enviable position that all he needs to do for the rest of his life is get a job he enjoys and pays enough to cover his recurring bills.

I fundamentally disagree with your logic, and you with mine. Continuing this debate will be fruitless. </TEXT>

Essentially you can set each part of your track to a different button on the midi controller and then when you press them it triggers the corresponding sample/clip. It's like having loads of different play buttons. And if you get one with knobs / sliders then you can start midi mapping things like volume, eq etc </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree - in the day and age of YouTube nobody has an excuse to not be able to maintain minor house problems. And as long as the city isn't in decline, real estate is money in the bank. Plus the money he's saving on (for example) $1000 a month rent is more than any stocks would give on a monthly basis.  

At university I owned a car and I rented, the combined expense of those was huge. Then I graduated, had to pay rent for like 5 more years until I saved for a deposit for a house. If I'd have gotten on the properly ladder in first year university I'd have easily saved ~ 50k in rent. 

And the things I'm advising may not be essential now, but they are in the long run, and provided the market doesn't crashC a house is an investment in itself. </TEXT>

Plus, I'm advocating getting on the property ladder whilst he has a lot of liquid cash, it means he won't be paying rent for his whole college career (provided he's not currently at home), plus if he is he could rent the house out for income, or live in it and sell it and purchase a new one should he choose to move house down the line.

<TEXT> I never had any debt at all until I was 26. I lived by your dads rule and it always served me well. All my friends racked up thousands and thousands on student loans (that they didn't need, it was just for a better student experience) and they're still paying them now.

However, the only reason I have debt now is because I went to apply for a mortgage and physically couldn't as I was a ghost in the eyes of banks. So I bought a motorbike (I could afford in cash) on credit just to build up a credit score and now I have a mortgage.

My advice would be don't buy things you can't afford, but even when you can, use a credit card and repay it instantly just so you build a consistent credit score.

1. Buy a nice house that's about 200/300k (it'll do you for life)
2. Buy a good second hand car (new is a waste as you lose so much cash instantly)
3. Keep like 100k for years and years worth of bills.

If you do the above it means you can live life like the rest of us except never having to worry about having a roof over your head or bills needing paid.  

Also, definitely stick it out at uni, 750k won't last forever.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was madness! When me and my girlfriend did the viewing it was winter and nighttime (in Scotland, this means it's DARK outside). So when we went in, every room had lights on except the bedroom which just had a shady little corner lamp. We asked her why this was and she said "oh the bulbs have gone" - no worries we thought. So when we bought the place I looked up and thought, wait a minute - that's a chandelier with like 6 bulbs, what are the odds all 6 have gone? But, I gave her benefit of the doubt and went out and bought 6 bulbs and (obviously) still no luck.

I phoned her and asked why she lied, she hung up (she's in her 50s/60s btw) and then my phone rang and it was her son saying we're lying and to stop accusing his mum because she definitely didn't say the bulbs were out.

I said to him that:

1. He wasn't there.
2. Both myself and my girlfriend were there.
3. Why does she even have an unwired light and light switch in that room if not for the purpose of tricking perspective buyers?

He got more hostile so I just gave up as it just seemed like a case of he said/she said.

Luckily that's the only issue I've had with the house since buying it... Touch wood. </TEXT>

I know it sucks but genuinely I think the older you get you realise that your parents just happen to be normal people who you happen to have been given birth from. They're equally as flawed, stubborn and (at times) stupid as your friends, your neighbours, your enemies, etc. Obviously it sucks to not be close to your parent, but them not accepting who you are is no different than, say, a stranger.

<TEXT> Haha sorry for the confusion, what I mean is;

Yes, ceilings (not roofs, my bad, I wrongfully use those terms interchangeably) are flush by definition, but I mean when I unscrewed the chandelier the previous owner had on the ceiling it was still flush, there were no wires, no holes to a cavity containing wires or any electronics, etc. She'd literally bought a chandelier and just screwed it arbitrarily to the ceiling to give the appearance of having working lights.

Similarly when I removed the light switch in this same room there was just a cavity behind it, but no wiring of any sort - again it was for show.

Does that clear up what I mean? If not, tell me and I'll try again! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bought a house and the bitch (previous owner) had screwed a chandelier to a flush roof (no wiring) and I took the light socket off the wall and there was no wiring there either.

Got a quote from a joiner but it worked out cheaper to just buy a hue system; so far I have:

Bedroom: light strip and bloom
Living room: 4 downlighters and whatever the bigger bloom one is called
Kitchen: 3 bulbs in hanging lights

I really like it. The 3 bulbs in the kitchen I set to blue, yellow, blue and as they hang down it almost makes the light fixtures like an ornament.

As I had no light switch in the bedroom being able to turn lights on and off from my phone, as well as just having lighting in general in the bedroom is awesome.

The downlighters in the living room I keep on white (could have bought the cheaper bulbs there!) but let me tell you, since installing these bulbs we never use the big overhead light, white light is so much better and airy feeling than normal yellow bulbs.

Yes, they were expensive, but if they last the 10/15 years quoted, I'm more than happy with them.  Would definitely recommend.

<TEXT> From a non judgemental point of view, it sounds like you're insinuating that because we can't explain those things that it's logical to just assume that one single entity created everything.

Remember that hundreds of years ago people couldn't explain gravity, the sun, illness, and similarly attributed it to the will of some higher power.

That's not to say God isn't real, but I feel like religion came around at a time where people were more lawless and were perplexed by the world around them so had to create something to explain the unexplainable and keep their peers in check. Now that science has advanced by light years, we still hang on to these archaic beliefs. </TEXT>

Occasionally you get tipped off guards are surrounding your encampment and need to survive as a team. Sometimes you need to go break into other facilities and steal equipment without being seen or, at least, without being followed back.

One member of the team could optionally/rarely be recruited by cipher (for bonus points) and they have hidden objectives to sabotage your missions or even try slyly kill a member. There could have been a mechanic where there's a way to mark someone as a traitor but it has dire consequences if you're wrong, so not everybody just does it all the time. </TEXT>

Also, Konami just need to get David Hayter back in for a decent length cameo, say snake almost does rescue them but the team believe it's not actually snake and evade him, and they'd be quids in.

There will of course come a time when times get set that can't be beaten, but I think another factor is that these athletes train for years with the current world record in their crosshairs as the time to beat so push themselves to beat it, which means as time goes on athletes are pushing themselves harder than the previous generation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Apologies for the bad example.

What I'm trying to say is, I'm not speaking about transphobic people who would flip about and become violent, nor am I speaking about trans allies who are fully accepting and understanding.

There is a middle ground of people who are nice to everybody regardless of sex, race, sexuality, but perhaps who would not choose to have sex with a trans person knowingly.

Let's not forget that the definition of a bigot is someone intolerant of people who hold different opinions - which in this case, would be you.

To some people a transgender persons gender is open to interpretation - genetically you're born one way, emotionally you're born another - it's not your decision which camp they fall into, although in an ideal world everyone should be accepting.

I think my ramblings can best be summarised by what someone said above: the key to informed consent is all parties being informed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not at all like that, though. The underlying issue is that not everybody views trans people as their preferred gender - whether that's right or wrong is another issue. But it means that, without disclosure of their trans status, a man could find out he's just unknowingly had sex with a "man" (mtf transgender) - which would make him feel like he's just had gay sex.

This isn't something that I agree with, but you have to appreciate that everybody has different moral stand points. 

It's akin to telling a devout Christian you've legally married them to have sex with them but you didn't actually file the correct paperwork. Sure, both sides are having consensual sex and may enjoy it, but finding out about something after the fact could cause somebody extreme emotional distress. 

I think it's hugely important that everybody accepts trans people for who they are, but it's equally important that trans people accept that not everybody does and that it's their decision to make. I'm not saying you need to go about telling everyone, but surely if you're about to have sex with someone they deserve to make an informed decision? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Firstly - As stated, I don't agree with the law - quite the opposite, I've said I disagree. Im just looking at it from both standpoints.

Secondly, the things you've mentioned are things that a person may oppose in their partner. But sleeping with someone transgender MAY cause a person to morally violate them self.  As strongly as transgender allies believe transgender people are the sex they desire to be, imagine someone on the opposite end of the spectrum unknowingly had sex with someone transgender, they will feel like they've had sex with someone outwith their sexuality. 

Just having a balanced debate here!

<TEXT> I do see your point, and your point is valid - however, I think it's slightly different.  

The issue isn't that transgender people have (or have not) had surgery - it's that not everybody's ideologies align and some people would not knowingly choose to sleep with somebody who is transgender and wouldn't therefore feel wronged if they did so unknowingly. Obviously not everybody feels this way, but impossible to know in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do agree with you all that this is unjust, however I can almost see what the law is aiming toward.  

I appreciate that while transgender individuals may be at peace with their gender, however people who you sleep with may be less so. The choice for consensual sex should always be with respect for both parties and with all cards on the table.

However, I do understand the flip side of this - that it becomes like nazi Germany with the Jewish having to wear the Star of David to identify themselves to others.  Where is the middle ground?

I think it shouldn't be classed as rape, however, if you fear that telling someone you're transgender may put them off sleeping with you, then perhaps that person is not a good sexual partner in the first place? Obviously that's difficult to know in advance and your safety is the paramount concern here. 

This is a tough one  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My biggest concern that is putting me off buying the game is that, with randomly generated planets, won't there be a lack of exploratory depth compared to say, fall out 4, for example? 

Is there some payoff to the grinding, or is it grinding for grindings sake?

Congratulations on your success for making your vision a reality and for the huge sales you'll undoubtedly achieve.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, sexuality, like gay, straight, bi, etc. Like, growing up, if someone male was effeminate it was assumed they were gay, it really wasn't ever talked about that they could be trans, etc. 

Then, watching that Louis Theroux documentary with young kids, I realised "oh, there's other possibilities and attributes out there". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anyone know how to clean a wooden table? I had a BBQ and the next day there was a bottle cap shaped black mark on my kitchen table. Not sure if it had been in the fire and was heated so it's burned into the table (unlikely as someone would have had to carry a hot bottle cap), if it was wet and this is some sort of water stain, or if it's rust or some other chemical reaction between the wood and metal?

Cheers! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I think that's the thing - as a cis its really hard to understand your struggle as its so hard to comprehend what it must be like to not be comfortable in your own skin! Such a shame. Even though I didn't get it before but feel I understand better now, I've never been against peoples' freedom to choose who they want to be, it's sad that some people try fit everyone into their idea of normal. 

I'm glad you found who you are, and to accept yourself! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm in the same boat - just lost oil job due to the downturn and I've been offered a new job with less pay. I'm fairly happy though as I had the oil job straight from university so I'm going to use this opportunity to broaden my horizons and learn new skills. Oil won't last forever, can't hurt to make contacts elsewhere. You can always jump back into oil when it picks back up? Or even try this new job and if you hate it then quit?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You mistake me - I have no issue "admitting" I'm gps spoofing, I am and that's why I'm providing gps coordinates as it's the only reference I know for these locations. You are insinuating that I'm encouraging others to do the same - I'm not, I'm simply providing locations of Pokemon for people to use as they choose, I'm not saying everyone should visit all 3 locations, but perhaps there's a Japanese person reading this as well as an American, etc.

I know it can be tempting to shit all over people trying to be helpful when you take your daily excursion out from under your bridge, but if the coordinates are of no use to you perhaps you could have just kept scrolling? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wouldn't worry about your lack of friends; I'd say out of my 20 closest friends maybe only 1 or 2 are from when I was your age, the rest came from university onwards. 

For your attention span problem, that's something you'll need to work on yourself - set goals, small at first with achievable targets, and visualise the steps you'll need to take to achieve them. 

In terms of worrying about money - you're 14, most 14 year olds have very little money (pocket money, minimum wage part time job, etc). It's good you have a goal (youtube), but perhaps you need to acknowledge that at 14 you're not going to have loads of cash and, instead, use that as motivation to become more goal orientated so that in future you get a high paying job. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be fair in this situation it sounds like you're being quite petulant - maybe the actual temperature change would annoy you, but a monthly expense change of $14 is very little and, presumably, in the long run you're saving a lot more by halving the rent? Also, trying to tell someone how many plugs to have in is pretty OTT - who sets the limit at what's acceptable? What if they came into your room and saw you had 3 plugged in and told you to cut it down to 2, etc? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Haha I was on Dragonmaw and I remember this! I remember how insanely notorious he was at the time, so much so that now, ten years later, I decided to google "Bennito is a ninja" and this article came up!

Although, from word of mouth, I'd always heard that he'd ninja looted out of Major Domo's chest.  I guess that's part of the chinese whispers that occur with notoriety.

Good story, man! </TEXT>
