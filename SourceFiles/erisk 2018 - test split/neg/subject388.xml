<TEXT> I'm gonna be honest here, I'm not doing well.

My lawyers have told me I have about a 100% chance of keeping the house - it's been in my family for  generations, and our (my) family name is wrought into the gate. Apparently these facts matter. God bless Texas.

I get too drunk too often now. I lost the love of my life. Things don't seem worth it.

Anyway, yeah, I've started divorce proceedings (luckily there's no custody to worry about - if I had done this a few months from now, things would be very different).

I love her, and I hate her for what she's turned me into. Luckily, my boss (remember Dan from the last post? Dan's the best.) has given me some extra PTO so I can deal with all this. If I had to work right now, I don't know what I would do.

In related news, she's keeping the literal bastard,

I dunno if any of this makes sense I've been drinking. Also I bought a tegu lizard online which should get here soon.

Tl;dd; fuck her, I've got a house and soon a lizard and no kids.

Update: that bot that deletes shit because of flair can go fuck itself in the asshole

Update 2: For fuck's sake, stop PMing me about redpill. I'm sad not pathetic. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Update: I figured out why my wife wanted me to get my vasectomy reversed so goddamn bad. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-10 21:37:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/3qsnwc/my_30m_formerly_cf_wife_28f_has_been_diagnosed/

TL;DR: my wife was an professional violinist and became depressed after being diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. Until that happened, we were both happily CF, and then she decided she needed me to get my vasectomy reversed so she could be a stay at home mom.

Update: After basically everyone both here and on /r/relationships said "go to couples therapy", we started going to couples therapy every other day, for a little over a week now. For the first few sessions, Claire was really actively trying to avoid the vasectomy issue. Man did that shit come up this morning.

Over the past week, I really thought that things were getting better. I felt hope, for this first time in weeks. We had talked through a lot of the things that had been depressing Claire and finding ways to work through them together.

Here's a thing I left out of the initial post because it was embarrassing to me. Claire has been drinking since her diagnosis. A lot. Not like "I never see her sober" a lot, but more than a person should drink a lot. She's been day drinking every other day or so. This has been one of the things that has been coming up in our couples therapy sessions, pretty regularly.

Fast forward to this morning. It was an emotional session the whole way through. It didn't help that last weekend was a concert from her former orchestra - we started off on that, and Claire broke down about it pretty quickly. We talked about that for a while, then some other things that I don't even really remember because I'm so fucking angry right now, then Claire brought up that she needed kids to be happy. Again. Fucking again.

Long story short, this turns into a giant fight between Claire and I, refereed by our therapist, which culminated in her tearfully telling me that she's pregnant. One day, while I was at work, trying to fucking provide for her, she fucked some dude and got herself knocked up. And she thought if she could convince me to reverse my vasectomy maybe she could fucking get away with it.

I'm not a violent guy, but I very genuinely wanted to slap this shit out of her right then. I still don't know what's worse, the fact that she cheated on me, or the fact that she tried to trick me into raising another man's child - especially since she's known since we met that I fucking hate children, or the fact that she tried to use my love for her to manipulate me. So, not wanting to hit my wife but at the same time desperately wanting to, I left. I didn't say anything, I stood up, grabbed my briefcase, and went to my car.

I called my boss and told him I wouldn't be able to make it back in today due to a family emergency. Let's call my boss Dan. Dan is the goddamn best boss I've ever worked for, and has become a good friend.

He asked what it was, and said they really needed me in at some point to get work done on a project that I'm heading. I broke down on the phone and told Dan everything, which has resulted in an extra week of paid time off, starting immediately, and a free dinner out tonight with Dan. I fucking love that guy.

Right now I'm checked into a hotel room, and I'm drinking my way slowly but surely through the minibar (yeah I know drinking isn't a healthy way to deal with problems but what the fuck ever) and waiting for Fallout 4 to download - I wasn't gonna buy it because I didn't have time to play it but I sure as hell do now. Saw the new James Bond movie a while ago, it was okay. I'm going out shopping later to buy clothes for the week because going home to get clothes means seeing her and I absolutely cannot see her right now. She's been blowing up my phone all day, which is why my phone is going to stay off until Friday. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 6 years ago, I met the most amazing woman I've never known. Let's call her Claire.

She was adventurous, intelligent, and incredibly talented (she's a violinist). We've been together since we met and married one year. 5 years and 10 months of that time has been absolutely blissful. Starting a couple of months ago, she started to develop aches and pains when she practiced for a long period of time. After I poked and prodded her for a while, she went to the doctor and was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. She stopped giving lessons a couple of weeks ago, and then she had to give up her chair in the orchestra she played in, and then she stopped playing altogether.

Since she stopped playing, she's become very depressed (and this isn't a self diagnosis - she goes to a therapist weekly now and she's on antidepressants). There were whole days when she was at her lowest when she didn't leave the house. She's told me that she feels like she doesn't have purpose anymore, and I hate that. Then, after she started the antidepressants, she decided that her calling in life was to raise children.

We've both been committed to being childfree since we met. After our wedding, we got all the "when are the kids coming" comments, and she hated them more than I did. Now she's totally changed her mind, and has told me that it's really important to her that I have my vasectomy reversed. She's brought it up once or twice every day for the past week.

I hate kids, but if I honestly thought it would help her, I would become a dad. I don't, though. I think she lost something really important to her and is looking to fill a void that can't be filled. I've tried talking to her about this and she broke down crying about how I wouldn't "give her children". I just don't think it would help. I think she's be just as depressed, but we'd have a kid to take care of on top of it.

I don't know how to help her. If having a kid is really what she needs, I don't want to keep her from that - but I don't think she's in the right place to make this kind of decision. A year ago she hated kids and now she thinks she needs them. I don't know what to do.

Before anyone says "divorce her bruh", I'm absolutely not willing to consider that. This woman is the love of my life, and I'm not willing to leave her when she's already hurting.

TL;DR: Wife is a professional violinist who was diagnosed with arthritis. She's become depressed and feels like she has no purpose, and wants kids now when she (and I) hated them up until now. I don't think having a kid will help and talking to her about it makes her break down. Help.

Edit: Woah. Good morning, Reddit. I'm headed out to work now, but I'm really looking forward to reading all the replies - the ones I saw last night were very helpful. I'll try to respond some while I'm at work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess this wasn't completely clear from the post - she hasn't *had* to stop playing. She can't play on a professional level anymore because her hands just can't do the more difficult stuff (not a musician so I can't speak eloquently to what that is), and she can't spend hours at a time doing it, so she can't teach lessons. She doesn't play anymore because it makes her miss being able to play well. Her quitting altogether is more depression than arthritis

Edit: I also didn't know that doctors who treat musicians were a thing. I'll try to find one on our insurance but our insurance sucks so this unfortunately may not be possible  </TEXT>

I'm not an artist, and I don't understand that world, but I'm worried that working in that world would make her miss it even more. I'll talk to her about this though and see how she feels. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think she's manipulating me. She's never said "give me children or I'm leaving". She just let me know its important to her - which is weird, because it never has been before. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 6 years ago, I met the most amazing woman I've never known. Let's call her Claire.

She was adventurous, intelligent, and incredibly talented (she's a violinist). We've been together since we met and married one year. 5 years and 10 months of that time has been absolutely blissful. Starting a couple of months ago, she started to develop aches and pains when she practiced for a long period of time. After I poked and prodded her for a while, she went to the doctor and was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. She stopped giving lessons a couple of weeks ago, and then she had to give up her chair in the orchestra she played in, and then she stopped playing altogether.

Since she stopped playing, she's become very depressed (and this isn't a self diagnosis - she goes to a therapist weekly now and she's on antidepressants). There were whole days when she was at her lowest when she didn't leave the house. She's told me that she feels like she doesn't have purpose anymore, and I hate that. Then, after she started the antidepressants, she decided that her calling in life was to raise children.

We've both been CF since we met. After our wedding, we got all the "when are the kids coming bingos", and she hated them more than I did. Now she's totally changed her mind, and has told me that it's really important to her that I have my vasectomy reversed. She's brought it up once or twice every day for the past week.

I hate kids, but if I honestly thought it would help her, I would become a dad. I don't, though. I think she lost something really important to her and is looking to fill a void that can't be filled. I've tried talking to her about this and she broke down crying about how I wouldn't "give her children". I just don't think it would help. I think she's be just as depressed, but we'd have a kid to take care of on top of it.

I don't know how to help her. If having a kid is really what she needs, I don't want to keep her from that - but I don't think she's in the right place to make this kind of decision. A year ago she hated kids and now she thinks she needs them. I don't know what to do.

Before anyone says "divorce her bruh", I'm absolutely not willing to consider that. This woman is the love of my life, and I'm not willing to leave her when she's already hurting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Or just give the kid some candy and don't be a twat about it.

Okay, tiny rant over. </TEXT>
