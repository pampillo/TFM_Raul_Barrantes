Is this guy on crack cocaine?

I was perusing the reviews for Logan which releases on DVD/Blu-Ray/On Demand on May 16, and I came across this guys review.

You always see these reviews, they either reach as far as they can to review a objectively terrible movie, and spin it with a good review, or they do the opposite for an objectively good movie.

Why do these reviewers do this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Rust is a lot of fun. 

I've played it off and on since the very beginning of the beta. 

It's changed so much, both graphically and functionally. 

If you love the building and combat minus the Dino's of ark, you'll love rust. Getting fire arms in rust is much easier too. So it's more of a shooter than ark. 

You'll need a good computer to play rust. Before when the graphics were shit, the game would play on a potato, but now it needs a decent PC to play at decent graphics settings. 

As far as my ark experience, would you suggest a 3x3 base, 2 floors? Will that get me to level 70?

My plan is to level up and then apply to some active tribes once im more useful. 

Also which attributes are safe to pump?

I've been doing 300 hp

200 stamina

250 weight. 

So far.  </TEXT>

Yeah it was one dragon and one bird looking thing, and they pecked the shit out of my base until it was gone. 

I was close to the beach. I'll try hanging out further in land this time around. 

On the 120 man server, I have a full stone base now, and over night no one touched my base. 

So I assume once I hit metal, the chances of being bothered is low. 

I'm hoping the same is true on Dino servers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, Im on one right now after you suggested it.

What's funny is that the couple of these 120 no tame servers, are all the most populated servers on the PS4 version.

I wonder if a lot of people dislike the Dino mechanics? Or is it just a more Rust experience people are after.

Im going to hop back on the regular Dino server after I get a bit more experience in this game. I just hope I can find a server that has people who don't take pleasure in griefing low levels for the sake of griefing them.

What material, do wyverns and the birds have a very tough time breaking through? Metal?

Because they absolutely destroyed my stone base. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've played a lot of Rust, but with the release of Ark on PS4, I wanted to try it out, since I prefer playing games on the couch.

Last 2 nights, I've been having fun, dying a lot (I'm on a PvP official server), but as a Rust player, deaths, especially at the beginning, come part in parcel for the game genre.

The one thing that did annoy me though, is that once I completed my small stone base, out of the sky, a dragon and a wyvern, came down and literally destroyed my base that took an hour or so to build, in a matter of minutes.

The dragon looked like Smog from the Hobbit movies, and the wyvern from WoW alliance flying mount.

Are these really high level beasts you tame? As in are these something only a high level can tame?

I just find it a little ridiculous that a high level can come and absolutely destroy my base, with little or no cost.

So my question is, maybe I'm confused and naive, as I am a new player, but are there any costs for these high levels to mobilize these really powerful beasts?

In Rust for instance, a medium progression base, still requires some time and effort, and maybe even some C4. It's costly and it makes it so you don't waste your time griefing newbies for the sake of griefing them.

But if these high levels can mobilize these massive dragons to come and smash my base in a matter of seconds, then this game may not be for me, as it makes literally no sense.

At least in Rust, while it's a brutal existence in PvP, it has some mechanics that keep high level players from wasting valuable resources in griefing low levels.

This isn't a complaint, but more of an inquiry, as to what I'm getting myself into.

The game is fantastic as far as everything, but the Dino's and their mechanics may not be something I'm into, especially if they are as strong as that massive dragon that ate my base.

Thanks in advance for any input. </TEXT>

A trend I'm seeing emerge are people who put tape over their isight.

Is it possible to hack an iPhone and a MBP to access the isights on either? And by hack, I mean through the internet or wifi network, not having physical access to either device.

For the record, I've never seen the camera on either my MBP or iPhone as a threat for personal privacy, since I keep both fully updated 100% of the time.

Can someone enlighten me?

I also always thought newer MBP's and iPhones have their LED's hardwired to the power source when the camera is access, so you will know when the camera is accessed. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> "Hello,

As you know, we care a lot about our customers. And we spend a lot of time troubleshooting and improving our customer service. Its at the core of what we do. But some of that lies beyond what we can do ourselves: it depends on rules set by the CRTC.

Well, were writing to ask for your help about issues we know matter to you -- because we believe that sharing your story with the CRTC will make a real difference.

Whats this all about?

As you know, TekSavvy serves most of its customers over leased last-mile facilities. It goes like this. We pay incumbents a rental fee to use their line into your home. We interconnect that line with our Internet and phone networks. And we provide Internet or phone service to you over the combined system.

Most of the time, that works out. On rare occasions, it doesnt. Now -- as in, right now -- the CRTC is asking for the publics views about fixing two problems:

Renting the incumbents last-mile means renting their install and repair services for that last mile, too.  But the CRTC has few rules about how many no-shows or how fast those installs   repairs happen.  Shouldnt it?
When the last mile is fibre in a new building or development, we still cant lease it.  Theres a plan for that to change once a long list of technical questions is worked through.  Eventually.  But what happens in the meantime?
If either of these has ever affected you, frustrated you, or moved you, its time to tell the CRTC about it. Heres how.

By end of this Monday (April 24): installs, repairs et al.

Until 8 p.m. Ottawa time this Monday, April 24, the CRTC wants to know what it should do about what it calls Competitor Quality of Service  rules on things like how many install visits are missed, how many repairs are delayed, how long last-mile service delays can last, and so on.

We know how often issues like these frustrate our customers. Well, this weekend, or Monday, are the time to tell that story to the CRTC.

Theyve boiled down what theyre looking for into a series of questions, and are looking for folks to type answers into an online form.

Were asking you to click to that form Here are some of the main questions and our takes on them (all of which are posted at the bottom of this document, known as Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2017-49):

Q2. Are market forces sufficient to ensure a high level of service or are Q of S regulatory measures required?

Market forces are the status quo -- no rules. If those have meant frustration for you, heres where you tell your story. How many times did you wait? Did you have to take the day off work? Why did it suck? Specify that youre answering question 2.

Q3. If a competitor Q of S regime is required, what should its objectives be?

We dont see why a TekSavvy customer should have to wait any longer than an incumbent customer for an install, for a repair, or for service. If you agree, say so -- identifying that as your answer to Q3.

Q10. What specific services should be subject to the regime?

We think the last-mile lines we lease should be -- it's the link that we flow your Internet and phone services over. We call that Wholesale Network Access, if youre looking for a term. Dont forget to note youre answering Q10.

Its clunky. But it could make a huge difference. Consider stepping up.

By end of next Monday (May 1): fibre me up?

Is fibre the only Internet access option where you live? But you want your ISP to be an independent, like TekSavvy?

If youre moving to a new building or development, we cant lease the last-mile fibre there. Eventually, we will. But its taking an awfully long time. How much longer? To be honest, noone quite knows.

Well, until 8 p.m. Ottawa time next Monday, May 1, the CRTC is asking for comments that either support, or oppose an application by our industry association, the Canadian Network Operators Consortium (CNOC) to expedite wholesale access to fibre where there are no other options, so we can quickly fill service gaps in vigorous competition.

Tell the CRTC that competition matters to you, and that you want them to break down the fibre wall, not eventually, but soonest. The fill-in form to that is here.

Gang, we wouldnt ask if it wasnt important. This time, it really is. The CRTCs asking, so if youre answering, nows the time."

<TEXT> Back in high school, we had this 5'10 grade 11 kid bullying this grade 8 or 9 kid who was around 5 feet tall.

One of the male teachers caught the 5'10 grade 11 kid punching the younger kid in the face.

The older teacher grabbed the 5'10 grade 11 kid by the back of the head and slammed his head into wall.

He ended up being fired over it. Many people argued that what the grade 11 kid was doing to the younger kid was assault, yet the police were never involved, yet when the teacher gets involved, it ends up being assault (even though he was doing it to protect the younger kid, and also send a deterrence to the older kid to stop).

Ridiculous. </TEXT>

This is an issue that needs to be tackled by both sides of aisle in cooperation.

I was wondering what kind of finish this was.

According to one response from my previous post:

[]AngrySquid1979 2 points 31 minutes ago 
I think it's anodized titanium. Also I think there is a way to do it on polished steel with a blow torch.

Another response:

[]CoyoteBanned 2 points 36 minutes ago 
That would either be a high polish blue of some kind of fancy case hardening. Either way someone went above and beyond on surface prep.

Any idea what kind of finish if the two above responses are wrong?

<TEXT> You could go even further, the scope of liability could extend to anything. 

For example, if someone enters your business and randomly stabs one of your employees or customers, you could be held liable.

If you don't draw the line on liability, you end up with scenarios where the law is overarching. 

As long as the business conducts itself as reasonably as possible, and follows the law and uniform codes, then the business owner should only be held liable where there is harm caused by negligence.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I originally posted this on the PS4 sub forum and they thought I was crazy, as though what I suggested was blasphemy.

All it is in my opinion is a change in functionality, if THEY the companies can sell a license, why can't WE turn around and use the same infrastructure to do the same thing?

Obviously the service should charge us a nominal fee to cover their administrative costs, but in the end, we own that license key, and therefore should be able to transfer it to whoever we want, as long as it doesn't infringe on privacy or abuse. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For instance, if you want to sell a digital version of a game you own or license, why can't you?

You can do it with a physical copy, yet we're restricted to do so with digital copies?

Legally this should be a regulated part of running a business that involves online licenses and IP's.

This should include Microsoft, Sony, Steam, Apple etc

If developers and publishers want to have an online store, they should offer a means to transfer licenses to other users of their service. They can do it for a small fee for whatever administrative costs it incurs.

I really see this as a way of curbing resell of a product, regardless if its online or not. I can resell physical objects, what makes online different?

This should be inclusive of everything in my opinion in regards to online sales, including games, music, whatever.

If you offer an online store, you should have to offer a way of allowing the consumer to resell the product (for a small administrative fee).

Furthermore, for MMO games, you should be able to sell the license of the game itself, but not the account or saved characters.

Obviously there should be a system in place to prevent piracy, possibly a one month timed lock on each license transfer. 

I don't feel that piracy and "game sharing" are a fair  defender against transfer of license. Especially if proper systems are in place to prevent its abuse. 

The doctrine of exhaustion is extended to physical objects, yet digital games are exempt. This makes no sense, as it isn't piracy if each license isn't duplicated.  </TEXT>

He's the heir to the family business.

Pauly Shore hijinks ensue, it's almost reminiscent of Pauly Shore in Encino Man.

Pauly has this old weathered beat up look to him, like he's been living a long hard life of partying and doing drugs, with a strange orange tan that doesn't (well a little bit it does) suit him. 

It's like driving by a bad accident, you want to turn away, but you can't. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, since it happened on his property, I think if he wants, the dude could intervene.

When the bear eats that deer, he's going to make a fucking mess.

I wouldn't want to deal with that mess, especially since it looks like the dude takes good care of his lawn.

He could at first ask the bear and deer to continue this somewhere else, if the bear and deer refuse to move, he should shoo them away with a broom.

If that doesn't work, then he needs to start yelling at them.

Then call the cops. Report two trespassers in his back yard. Let the cops deal with it when they show up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Liberal Arts degrees are great. 

They can help shape you as a person. This idea that the degree itself will land you a great job is nonsense. You as a person can either utilize your degree in synergy with your job goals, or you can blame your degree for your shortfalls.

Liberal Art graduates can go on to graduate school, professional schools (MBA's, Law school, etc), entrepreneurship, whatever.

I've never heard of this running joke about Liberal arts majors being hit by some dead end. It must be pissed off STEM graduates who are usually stressed out by their curriculum, and hate the fact that liberal arts graduates can land successful careers.

In fact, STEM graduates need to worry about the future, as computers in general are replacing some of their skills and expertise through automation.

In short, figure out what you want in life. If a liberal arts major will allow you to hit those goals, then go for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Didn't Alan Greenspan have a huge bearing on the 2008 financial crisis, with his deregulations of certain business practices?

If the chair of the fed can have such a contribution to a financial crisis, why couldn't the president of the United States have a similar role in increasing or decreasing job growth dependant on the bills he advocates and signs?

Why do lobbyists bother lobbying government if ultimately the government and its leader, the president, have little control on economic change?

As to my question, obviously Reagan and his government (congress) had some effect, either through direct legislation, or staying out of the trend. 

I'm wondering what Reagan did or didn't do that caused the beginning of the decline in manufacturing jobs in the US.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems like with Detroit missing the play offs the first time in 20 years, it's made me wonder. 

What if the Canucks followed a similar philosophy as Detroit did back in the 90s?

Instead of making a team that were Stanley Cup material, why not make a team that can consistently make the play offs every year?

It's like Gretzky said, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. 

You can't win the Stanley Cup if you don't make the play offs. 

So in short, instead of this high octane build philosophy, why don't we go baby steps and start with a team that can consistently make the play offs?

<TITLE> Just a question for you Destiny players regarding Destiny 2. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-31 04:01:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was eagerly awaiting Destiny 1 back before it was released.

I eventually decided not to dive in and buy the game, nor did I ever have the urge to buy it since the game felt neutered from what was promised.

My question for you current/past players, wasn't the Destiny 1 game supposed to be a 10 year project, supported by constant content updates and changes?

I seem to remember Bungie talking about how this game will be something that would be malleable, and augmented depending on what the players wanted?

This would be over the course of 10 years.

So I'm wondering, in it's current state, is Destiny 1 nowhere near what Bungie promised?

Is Destiny 2 meant to be what Destiny 1 was supposed to be?

I'm just so confused, because it seems like Bungie really has no clue on what the fuck they wanted to do with Destiny 1, so how do things look for Destiny 2?

For you people who remember what Destiny 1 was supposed to be, does Destiny 2 show some promise? Is it worth it for someone like me (who was hyped by the original Destiny 1 development promises), to follow Destiny 2?

Thanks in advance for any input. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is no Conservative party.

I suggest you write Trump and tell him to go to war with the republican party. If you want to fix America, you need a strong Conservative party, and right now the Republicans are lost and confused. They don't have any modicum of the idea of what conservatism is.

They can't do anything without lobbyists directing them. This is not a sign of a strong party.

The democrats are always going to be the way they are, and eventually as more minorities and SJW's start voting, the republicans are going to lose ground, especially when Republicans are in power they are too busy stripping liberties from the American people because they rather appease their lobbyists. They couldn't even repeal Obamacare, with Trump as president and them controlling both the house and senate. I didn't even agree with the current healthcare repeal and replace bill per se, but if Trump told them to pass it, they should have passed it, just for party lines and momentum sake.

We need strong conservatives in the position of power, not shills (Ryan).

And yes I'm pissed about them passing that ISP privacy law. I would expect conservatives to go back to the drawing board and make it so NO company can release and profit off my private data, including Google, Facebook, etc, without me OPT'ing IN.

But I guess that makes too much sense. Fuck this Republican Party, what a joke.

Anyways, when your accidental/negligent discharge happened, what was it like? Did it scare the shit out of you? 

Did you instantly realize you weren't expending enough due diligence when handling your gun? 

Where did the bullet get lodged (hopefully not hurting anyone)?

Did you need to report the discharge to police or your local government? What happened afterwards, did you face any fines/penalties?

Just to shed light on the matter for us people who treat their guns with utmost respect, but realize accidents can happen to the best of us. </TEXT>

Every time I went up against the law bringer he parried every single attack, and I mean side hits, over head, feigns he didn't get baited into.

He went up against my partner, same thing, parried every attack. Countered every guard break Literally every attack was surgically landed. I went up against him again on the 3rd and last round, same shit, so I said fuck this before he landed the last heavy, and quit.

I don't know if it's possible to cheat on PS4, I don't know if he was cheating though, because he wasn't baited by my heavy feigns.

I should have recorded his name, maybe I went up against the greatest law bringer on PS4 for honor. </TEXT>

Could your union be blamed? It seems like they push the lowest common denominator, by protecting their base and their own interests, while resting on the shoulders of the "few" good teachers who do exemplary work to use as an example of why the Union deserves more.

You sound like you've invested in a career, and an important career, as educating our youth will come to benefit or haunt us in spades as they take over our worldly responsibilities.

You put in the time, the effort, and the expertise. So where is your monetary gain? 

My question to you is seriously, who do YOU blame, the union or the state/local government? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't necessarily agree with this.

A lot of social workers do the work because they love it, and the pay is apparently garbage. You need to love your job, especially one like teaching and taking care of others, before you can be intimately involved enough to change lives and the direction those lives are heading.

Yes pay can draw in "talent", but what you're stipulating is that throwing money at teachers should "fix" the education system.

Now if we paid High school teachers 100k a year, do you think the results would be better? I'm sure they would be (marginally or more so), but would that be the best use of the money.

The fact, is that we have students dropping out of school, and we need to figure out why students are dropping out of school. We also need to find ways to encourage students to be successful, not necessarily in math or physics, or biology, but successful in life.

Learning about math, and biology, and physics should help shape them, and give them tools to succeed, but it shouldn't be a baseline for their success. 

Get rid of the baselines, and start teaching students to be happy, and strive for their own goals. Give them tools, but make sure learning about those tools doesn't end up causing them to drop out and fall on their faces before they even get a chance to spread their wings as young adults. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, you're making the assumption that all abusive relationships end up in murder.

If you were a law student, then you would know this notion that "almost always" or "absolutes" is counter intuitive, especially when you don't have any facts or statistics to back up your crazy claims.

Can you explain to me how 1700 women (out of 150 million women in the US) dying to spousal abuse every year is somehow alluding to whatever the fuck you're talking about?

Can you also explain to me how the law and police barely protect anyone? If that was the case, how do police forces keep being funded, if they don't produce results? After all, even police have quotas, and they have a requirement to meet those quotas.

You do realize (that is, being a law student, lol), that people in a relationship, is also synonymous as a partnership, therefore there are two people involved, and two perspectives. The police need to take these two perspectives into account because arresting someone is a serious matter. The due diligence of the law far outweighs crazy claims that all abusive relationships end in murder.

Furthermore, in 2013 they reauthorized the VAWA (the original VAWA dropped domestic issues by 64%), so yes congress is trying to tune the law to protect people the best they can.

This idea that the law can protect everyone is nonsense, there are cases where no degree of policing can protect someone. Especially when they need to respect privacy and property laws. Furthermore, there is human error, after all police are humans. While it's awful when a spouse is killed, that doesn't mean our system is failing, it just means that we need to figure why it happened and fix it the best we can.

Now if you have suggestions for a better overall system, then by all means, run for congress and throw around nonsense claims. I'm sure you'll attract a few people who want to delude themselves into the idea that the police are useless and (almost) all abusive relationships end in murder. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't understand how paying teachers more money is going to make "education" better.

I'm not saying they don't deserve more money, as everyone deserves a raise within a 5 year period.

But I just don't understand how you equate teacher pay to valuing pubic school children.

We need to separate the two issues. Teaching is a job, and the pay that goes with it should have no bearing on the quality of education.

Instead, we need a flexible and modern curriculum, find out what our generation is interested in, and design a learning curriculum in what students WANT to learn. 

It seems like education has turned into this treadmill, where the object isn't about quality, but instead about placating this notion that students need to finish school to be successful in life.

School should be a place that doesn't define you, but helps shape you. We need to encourage students to be successful, and follow their passions. Sure we need to teach them the basics, like reading, math, whatever, but mix it up.

If the system is leaving some students behind, why not experiment with these students. Test new curriculum on them, see if it works, instead of just funding these so called "drop out" factories. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If this was a fact, then the battered woman's defence would be a sound argument in every instance of abuse.

As it stands, just because a spouse is abused, it doesn't mean that they can turn around and kill their spouse out of fear for their lives and claim self defence to protect themselves from an impending threat. So the battered woman's defence isn't applicable in every notion of abuse, because statistically what you're claiming doesn't hold any water.

Some spouses live in an abusive relationship for years, others leave, others invoke the law to change the situation, and in a small fraction, a spouse kills another spouse. According to google, 3 women are killed everyday by a spouse. 1,700 women were killed in 2015 from spousal abuse. How many abusive relationships are there? I would assume in a population of over 300 million, probably a lot more than that.

This idea that every case of abuse turns into murder is absolutely insane. If that was the case, it would be lamented as an epidemic, and the police would be highly vigilant in any notion of domestic abuse.

They would also get rid of the 2 strike rule and someone goes to jail on a domestic abuse emergency call, and instead arrest the "supposed" offending party immediately to investigate thoroughly, as statistically the abused party will be murdered eventually.

Don't go around making outlandish claims that all domestic abuse leads to murder. You sound like a fucking twat. </TEXT>

How do you decipher the difference between an angry abusive boyfriend, from one who is going to snap and kill his girlfriend?

Sometimes the cops prevent catastrophe, sometimes they don't.

We could fund more police personnel, but in the end, sooner or later, one sad horrible incident will slip through the cracks.

It seems like a good chunk of murderers who kill their loved ones, don't go out and kill anyone else. So both reactive and preventative measures are going to be limited to basic law and enforcement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't agree with this notion that we have extremities of right and left on a Federal level. 

Canada is different in politics for a plethora of reasons. Our responsible government model really perpetuates this toe the line mentality, so when Canadians give a majority government the reigns to do as they like, you tend to see a lot of bills past that our either center left or center right. 

We also don't attach political beliefs to our parties like Americans do. Rarely if at all do I see pro or anti abortion rhetoric in campaigns for either side. The question on homosexuals being able to become married was entertained by both sides of the aisle here. 

Our politics are really center, so when you hand the reigns to the liberals or the conservatives you see very little change in any direction. It seems to be what's best for the country as a whole.  The conservatives will be a bit more conservative with their budget bills, and the liberals will be a bit more liberal. But never a sense of extremism or urgency for change with either or. 

In comparison to the US you see this waring of factions, democrats vs republicans. A lot of baggage is attached to both sides. It doesn't seem like what's best for the country, but instead what will spite the other side. 

It's really sad because in the 50s and 60s it seemed like politics in America was about the people. At least from what I read.  </TEXT>

It seems like Stalin did quite the opposite, and instead just used Communism as a means to manipulate everyone. His power base got richer, and the poor and impoverished got poorer. He did this by enslaving everyone to the state, either through force or dependency. There was no plan for freedom. 

In return I'll show you the parallels of Friedmans theory of capitalism and how it conspired in the deregulation of Wall Street and the 2008 mortgage bubble.

<TEXT> How is it not working?

They just started implementing the ID attachment to ticket sales. 

The only complaints that have arisen are ticket buyers worried about not being able to offload tickets they can't use. 

Secondly, as one news article has stipulated, the ID attachment is the equivalent of a performer adding DRM to their concerts. 

If an artist doesn't want their tickets to their concert being resold for a higher price why are they not allowed to stem it with systems in place that prevent the resale of their product?

Informal markets have been stemmed here in Canada. A two tier healthcare system has been shot down many times. There is a small demand for it, but as a whole Canadians want to keep our single tier universal healthcare system. 

If artists and venues don't want their tickets resold, and they put in the proper systems to prevent it, then you'll see any informal markets done away with in regards to ticket reselling. 

How do you get around bulk ticket buying limitations, ID attached to each ticket? You don't.

Secondly ticketmaster has a 3rd party site to pay a premium for tickets. The difference is that it's a pre arrangement between the venue and ticketmaster. There is also a small amount of tickets reserved for this said service. Which leaves the rest of the tickets for the actual event goers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is wrong.

We don't live in a society that is pure capitalistic in nature. In fact no society exists with pure capitalism. All western societies are both capitalistic and socialist. They have regulation and "free" markets dictated by laws.

Therefore this idea that economics makes sense with ticket scalping is absurd, as the laws and regulations are clearly heading to restrictions on ticket reselling. The reason for this is clearly because the people involved, performers and consumers don't want middlemen marking up the price of tickets. Both the performer (seller), and the consumer (buyer), don't benefit from scalpers in anyway shape or form.

Nobody here is complaining about "ticket price", we're here complaining about ticket price being ballooned by scalpers, who offer nothing in return. 

Those ticket prices set by the artist should be the price of admission, hence why the complicated relationship between artist, agent, financial accountants etc, and Ticketmaster dictate a certain price.

Now if the performer/venue side of things charge $500 dollars for a ticket, that's fine. Their fans may be upset, but at least the performer and artist can put that gross profit into the performance or venue.

The scalper, doesn't add fuck all to the performance or venue. They get all of the benefit of a profit, without adding a single fucking point of value to the performance. The only risk they take, is if they can't offload the tickets, in which they take a hit. Then they end up selling the tickets in front of the arena or venue for a loss, in which those tickets would have been better available on the website where they were originally being sold, where the people who could have gone to the show, would have bought them in a convenient and planned manner.

Now if the scalper made the tickets more accessible to the public through some infrastructure, then sure, they could charge a surplus. But instead, they make getting the tickets more difficult. They take away the chance for the show goers to get the ticket originally intended, AND, they then charge a surplus to resell the ticket on craigslist or in front of the venue.

Now if you want to allow "economics" to have free reign, then you would need to allow the scalpers to use these "Bots" to purchase tickets en masse. Since everyone would have "access" to these bots (since you can buy them online or from someone who codes them), that would be fair competition.

Secondly, if you want economics to have free reign, the performer shouldn't have a say in how much each ticket costs. Sure they can set a reserve, but every ticket should be auctioned from Ticketmaster. You remove the secondary middleman, and Ticketmaster and the performer make the profits.

Free reign economics is a mess and it's garbage. Hence why we have regulatory bodies, consumers and performers wanting it to be a simple "Buy this ticket", then go to the show process.

Not a frantically competing with not only people who want to go to the show, but also scalpers and resellers, when you're trying to buy tickets online from Ticketmaster.

Now you guys can throw around the "Economically this...." all you want. But keep in mind, deregulation is what fucked up the housing market between the late 90s and 2008. Profits and economics took priority over the general good.

We have no problem with "sellers" making a profit. We do have a problem with people "reselling" without adding any value to a service or product. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What logic?

Let's take your luxury car example. Lamborghini sets a price for their speciality cars, and they go based on a waiting list. It's not based on who wants to pay more or not. 

There is a set price by the retailer/manufacturer, and they usually stand by that price. 

When a hot item comes out, a lot of retailers will put a 1 hot item per household. Why do they do this? Because resellers who buy an item and then resell for a higher price create an unnecessary added cost for the item. This doesn't benefit anyone except for the reseller. 

The two most important parties involved in a product or service being purchased is the seller and buyer. If the seller and buyer agree to not have a middleman in the transaction, then they should have that right. Furthermore, there is an added benefit of buying from the supplier, knowing that your product is authentic and guaranteed. 

With scalpers you don't even know if the tickets are real. Another reason that our city and ticket master are cracking down on scalpers. Fraud runs rampant among resellers. 

The process of buying and selling is both cheaper and more efficient when you cut out the middleman and just buy from the supplier. 

Now logically, the consumer would rather buy Katy Perry tickets for:

$125 dollars from ticket master 

Instead of 

$300 dollars from a piece of shit scalper. 

The added cost isn't because they provide a service,   Or benefit to the consumer. 

Lastly, if you cut out the reseller through measures and systems, you'll only have one type of consumer and purchaser: 

People who want to go to the concert, or buy tickets for their friends and family who want to go to the concert. 

We don't need scalpers or resellers in the ticket sales business. They don't provide anything the consumer demands. They are dirty little bitches who manipulate the system to gain a profit. The regular consumer pays the price for the resellers greed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Go read another Milton Friedman book. 

You seem to think that the consumer and performer have no say in how the tickets are distributed. 

This isn't the free market per se. 

It's a contract between the performer, venue, and ticket master. It's also the cities issue as a lot of people dislike scalpers hawking tickets in front of the arena. As our news coined our scalpers as an "eye sore". 

If all three of these entities want to regulate the distribution of the tickets then the free market takes a back seat. 

I'm sure most performers rather their fans and people who intend to see the concert get the tickets. Why would they want a middle man cost added to their tickets? How do they benefit from this?

You have a dog in this fight. Are you a slimy reseller?

Only two kinds of people advocate for scalping. Scalpers themselves and clowns. 

Which one are you?

It's like you get a hard on at the thought of some person making a profit off reselling tickets. The fact that a family of four cant afford to go to a concert or hockey game because scalpers inflated the price of the tickets to hundreds of dollars probably makes your heart palpitate.

<TEXT> You're wrong on every single point except for the complications of buying tickets for your family or friends. 

You can blame the scalpers for this complication. There is a cost to preventing people from abusing the system. Unfortunately this is one of the costs. 

Fortunately many areas are adopting new regulations on ticket sales, which inherently prove your points as moot.

You could also have bought those tickets from the vendor window as last minute as well. 

Also as far as our housing prices here, the government is actually trying to cool the market with a 15% tax on foreign buyers and other means. 

Our property tax went from $6k a year to over $12k, so yeah property owners are crying their eyes out. 

Listen I get what you're trying to do. But you need to stop. Scalpers and reselling tickets is an issue. Performers and venues don't want people adding a middle man cost to tickets unnecessarily. Consumers looking to go to the show also don't want this added cost.

You're taking tickets away from people who want to go to the concert but weren't fast enough to beat you to the punch. 

My point isn't that you alone are a drop in the bucket of the resell issue. 

My point is that if 200 people do what you're doing, then they take thousands of tickets away from actual concert goers. These concert goers then need to pay a mark up because of people scalping the tickets. 

A better system is if no one bought surplus tickets to resell for a higher value, and instead people who wanted to go to the concert were able to buy the tickets at a base ticket value. 

Nobody likes resellers/scalpers because they piggy back off the performers and venue presenters, to make a easy buck, but that buck comes from ripping off the poor people who just want to go see a show. 

Nobody likes scalpers, get that through your head. You're not some smooth operators profiting from ingenuity. You guys are losers. 

I would put scalpers, rapists and pedophiles all in the same category of societies degenerates.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Go take your medication and go to sleep. 

You're so full of shit. 

You're buying a commodity that is very limited and marking up the price. 

These concerts only come around once every couple of years for people's favourite artists. 

People want to go see the concert. They don't want to deal with resellers. Most rational people would love a system in place that enforces the base ticket cost.

<TEXT> Actually those are two different things. 

A soda can isn't a one time show.

Buying and reselling a ticket from a performer isn't ok. The performer sets the price and that should be the price of admission. Period. It shouldn't balloon to twice the amount just because someone wants to profit off of a performers tickets. These events should be affordable so young people and families can afford to go and have fun. 

Buying a hockey ticket for the sole reason to resell it for a higher profit is what prices out a lot of families from going to see the games here. After all it's a family event, not an event for fuck heads to make a profit by reselling the tickets for exuberant prices. 

You're assuming I can't afford to go see these venues or games, I can easily afford either base price or resell. So I don't need to get into your line. 

The point is, as a city, things are slowly changing for the better. Not only have the consumers here advocated for scalpers to fuck off, but so have big name performers and venues. Ticketmaster is putting in measures to prevent resell, and its wonderful. 

Your point is moot. Anyone who advocates for scalping is an idiot.  </TEXT>

In fact they started making the tickets ID required. You can buy tickets for your friends, but you need to go in with them if the tickets are attached to your ID. 

People like you have no idea how bad scalpers can be when you live in places with high costs of living.

One of the worst customer and tech support I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with.

Apple
Amazon
Microsoft

They clearly hire people who want to do the job. They are articulate and English is their first language.

English

When they patch it in after the fact, they can add the "Pro" symbol to the top right corner of the game on the Home screen.

I'm sure game companies want to offer support for their game consumers, and that should include Pro or Boost support.

You subscribe to them as a customer for two years. They subsidize the phone, which in reality is a drop in the bucket compared to the profit they make off you as a customer. 

At the end of the contract, they unlock the phone for you as your relationship as customer and company ends on the terms set out.

I have an authentic $400+ Burrows Jersey, I bought the same year they made that Stanley Cup run. (Sometime in January). Have never bought another Canucks jersey prior to this. You see a lot of Henrik and Luongo Jersey's, not a lot of Burrows.

Have always loved guys who played with heart, which he was the epitome of.

At least the Sens are benefiting from him.

It's weird rooting for a team when they trade your favourite player. I was born and raised in Burnaby, always loved the Canucks.

Feels weird man. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Listen buddy boy. 

If you get it, then you would understand that the voting at the end of a skirmish match is pointless if everyone leaves after the match. Which happens constantly.

Secondly, the current matchmaking is garbage. So the more posts that point this out the better. The matchmaking should have more variables. Some people want to play 4v4 with no boosts or equipment stats, then let them queue with these settings. Some people want to queue for duels with boosts and equipment boosts, then let them. 

Some people want to queue with all randoms and no preset teams, etc. 

Now go take your meds and take a nap. You sound tired and confused.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When you want to play 4v4 elimination and you need to wrestle with the matchmaker that means that the matchmaker is broken. 

It's very simple:

If I set it to elimination, it shouldn't *try it's best* to put me in an elimination game. It should either put me in an elimination or make me wait longer until one opens up. Not put me in a god damn skirmish game. 

Whoever designed this matchmaker system is really low brow. 

In fact, not only should I have the option to set it to 4v4 elimination. I should also have the option to set it to no Equipment stats etc. 

Let the players decide what is feasible and enjoyable for the matchmaker. 

Furthermore, we need a mercenary mode. I don't want to play against preset teams of 3 to 4 against my team of all ransoms. 

Come on Ubisoft, this is 2017. Matchmaking and its standardization have evolved.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't have any, but my dad did. He used to tell me about all the snowmobile, atv, hunting, fishing trips that my grandfather used to take my uncle and my dad on. 

They would head into the bush and sleep under the stars, or in a tent depending on the season. Always with their rifles and hand guns, hunting and/or fishing. 

When my dad was older, early 20s, his parents split up. My grandfather bought a huge acreage farm. My dad would head out there once in a while, and sometimes they would just sit in the porch of his house and shoot coyotes out in the fields. My dad told me these were some of the best times he had with his dad out at that farm. 

My dad never took me out to do the same types of things. Different locations and circumstances, but I have some physical pictures of their moments. 

I envy this type of shit. I feel like I missed out on some of the best things that life offers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can you clarify please,

Does FFXV and TLOU have you choose between:

1) Standard/OG PS4 Mode

2) 1080P enhanced PS4 Pro mode

3) 4K PS4 Pro Mode

Or do only 2 and 3 exist on the PS4 Pro Patched Games? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Or do I need to set them as enabled INSIDE the PS4 Pro patched games video settings? Or are these settings changed in the PS4 Pro Operating system settings?

In other words, are these 1080P enhanced modes on by default/mandatory with PS4 Pro patched games?

I'm currently on a 1080P TV, may upgrade to a 4K TV when a more practical HDR one is available.

Thanks for your input.

PS: To go into detail, does the Standard/OG PS4 graphics mode exist on patched PS4 Pro games? Or are there only two modes available:

1) 1080P Enhanced versions

2) When played on a 4K TV, the "4K TV Mode" </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's because the media never emphasizes how progressive tax systems work. If people understand the progressive tax and YOUR effective tax rate, then people would understand that the current taxes aren't that bad. The people with more disposable income pay more taxes.

Fox news clumps people making 30k a year with people making over 250k a year, with this idea that the 35% tax rate is all encompassing.

I'm Canadian, and we seem to have a better understanding about the progressive tax system here. I think it's because we learn a little about it in high school. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From my memory it wasn't sexual conduct. The artist painted them in a natural way. 

I don't remember the details but it wasn't "sexual". 

It was a public art gallery for artistic value. Not sexually stimulating. I can't find the incident but it was a while ago. 

The issue at hand is where do we draw the line between art from original mind (from the mind without a real subject), and then actual child pornography. 

We need to protect the interest of children, but not at the expense of over reaching laws that put legitimate artists in jail for drawing art. 

I'm not an artist myself but I'm sure people could interpret what the artist was trying to accomplish by doing what he did.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This right here. 

I remember taking a law class once where you really learn how a lot of laws have overreaching breadth. 

In Canada we had an election coming up, and the incumbent government wanted to be tougher on Sex offenders. 

They wrote a law where basically it had such overreach that even artists portraying art in a public art gallery were shutdown and arrested. I think the artists painted pictures of naked children, painted from his mind, not actual subjects. 

If a 17 year old couple video taped themselves having sex and possessed that video when they turned 18, they were in possession of child pornography. 

I'm all for going after people producing real child pornography and real sex offenders doing especially heinous sexual assault, but I also want to make sure none of these laws are over reaching, especially for political gain and agendas. 

These people writing the laws are elected because we believe them to be intelligent enough to write laws to protect society, protect the innocent, and respect the super law(constitution).  </TEXT>

But can you blame them when the government came up with silly colour coded degrees of terrorist danger?

The government fabricated a boogeyman to make up for their own inept ability to prevent 9/11. They knew that there was an organization out there planning to use planes to attack the US and ignored it., or didn't take it seriously enough. 

They then invaded Americans personal rights to privacy and life in an attempt to what? I still don't know what the patriot act achieved. 

What they did achieve is a destabilized Middle East, a population of Americans who can't dissent because they are either labeled as traitors, or worse terrorist. 

I love seeing some accountability on the government. These whistleblowers are needed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who played end game ffxi back in 2003 and early 2004, I came back because of the trusts. 

Anyone who played back then knew the pain of doing things. You had to either get your linkshell to help or you had to fuss with the translator (most of the high levels were JP after the NA launch because the game launched in Japan before NA). 

The other reason is because places like sky were a pivotal part of my time in ffxi back then. Watching my alliance both kill and get slaughtered by sky bosses was fun. 

Sky was one of those places in a video game that felt living and breathing. It pulled out linkshell together to overcome its challenges. 

Seeing things like the hauberk and sniper rings being dirt cheap today also is hilarious. 

Hanging out in lower jueno before the Ah's were linked was crazy too. 

Chains of promethia the first day it came out was nuts. Crafters making a fortune off of lvl 30 gear. Chains of promethia was both difficult and wonderful. 

Lastly, while the community is friendly and helpful now, I miss my old ffxi comrades. Something about this game pulled the community together. 

So in short, what brought me back was the curiosity of changes to the game, state of the community, and trusts. Also the game was on sale for $10, can't argue giving it a go again at that price point.  </TEXT>

I'm a firm believer that once the fetus hits the 8th or 9th month, he or she should be protected under the charter of rights (Canadian) or Constitution (American). This belief isn't religiously based. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I played back in 2003 (I think, I played right when it was released in NA).

I quit a little after when the expansion with that place in the sky (it was circular, with the same architecture as that huge white building in la theime (holla) and had beautiful gardens and trees on the island in the sky. It also had 4 or 5 huge HNM's you could spawn. I forget the name.

I was in the Linkshell "Easy Company" from Midgardsormer, we eventually took over as the best NA Linkshell for endgame content after the main linkshell hopped ship to another game.

I remember competing with the JP players for HNM spawns, and literally watched them a couple of times reorient the spawn timer on a couple of HNM's by turtling them for 5-10 hours.

I eventually quit a bit before WoW came out, as I was a DRK and got bored of being a stun bot who was outshined by RNG and BLM for DPS. So I haven't played for a very long time.

Couldn't remember my credentials or anything about my old account so I'm starting over.

I'm planning to play a PLD, since I've always wanted to be a PLD back in the day, just didn't have time to reroll.

Is PLD/WAR still the basic job/subjob combo for end game content?

Also, I've read about all these new features (trusts obviously) etc:

In what order should I do these:

Get my subjob, WAR, up to 50.

Do ROV's up to the white ribbon (I think thats what its called)

Get my nation reputation up to Rank 5

Get my chocobo license

Records of eminence, I currently have 2500, but I have no idea how I got them. I remember killing some shit in that cave for the Squire II quest and seeing 1200/5000.

Are records of eminence and RoV tied in together?

Should I spend my Sparks on any swords yet? I'm currently lvl 36 on my war subjob.

Lastly, this is a big one thats really screwing me. Gil. I don't remember having a Gil issue back when I played. But right now I have no idea how to keep up with my Gil and levelling at the same time.

One more thing, I'm currently on Asura, any newbie friendly/chatting type linkshells I could get into. It's pretty lonely hanging out in new player areas, and seeing people chat on linkshell chat would alleviate that.

Thanks in advance for any input. </TEXT>

But why do people need to lose their jobs with one stupid comment? We have free speech, yet if you say something really dumb and uncalled for, especially as a civil servant, you lose your job.

If you work in a private sector job, people will actually go out of their way to petition the company to fire you, or they will rally the other SJW's to boycott your company. Furthermore, the company itself will fire you as though it's something to commend.

Whatever happened to forgiving people and hoping they grow as a human being? We don't need to forget and turn a blind eye, we can ridicule them, but hoping/expecting these people to be fired is erroneous. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah she hurt herself by backing Clinton. I get it.

But she's still a good human being, and a great politician.

The problem is that Hillary Clinton has been a stain on the Dems for years. Why the fuck would they usher her to a General election candidacy? Also why would they drag some good politicians down with her, like Sanders and Warren?

Both Sanders and Warren were excellent candidates, because they were 100% trustworthy. For fuck sakes, Clinton had a hard time finding any dirt on Sanders. They had to stick to policy in the primary, because even Sanders didn't want to get involved with the rhetoric of Hillary's emails.

The DNC created a huge mess. They fucked the Democrat party for years to come. </TEXT>

c) You wanted the PS4 Pro as a 4K Blu-ray player, and because it doesn't include that, you don't see any reason to upgrade from a PS4.

d) Not enough games take advantage of the PS4 Pro yet, and you want to wait to see how well it's adopted by current and future titles.

e) You're really satisfied with your PS4, and upgrading isn't necessary.

f) Can't afford it as moneys tight at the moment.

For me, its a combination of B and E.

Edit: Added f) Can't afford it as moneys tight at the moment.

His staff will schedule him with policy makers favourable to the agenda. These people will also be scheduled at the end of the chain.

Trump will serve a single term, then America will wake up and realize that their economy and job issues stem from years of Republican and neo liberals bullshit. (Reagan/Bush's, Bill Clinton). 

If you want to fix the issue, you also need to get rid of obstructionism in Congress. Meaning, get rid of the Republicans in both the senate and the house who have rather put party loyalty (and lobbyist interests) above the peoples needs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you look at the most successful people in this world, i.e. Billionaires.

One study showed that the degree most represented was Engineering, then followed by Business, then Arts.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/06/03/what-degree-you-should-study-to-become-a-billionaire/

While STEM graduates like fostering their superiority, they only made up double as many Arts billionaires.

Ironically, the vast majority of Billionaires didn't study or have any degrees at all.

So I guess if you want to be a billionaire, skip school, be smart, be lucky, and pay engineer, business, and arts graduates to do your dirty work. </TEXT>

You could tell he loved his country so much, that he knew he had to be honest about what he believed in, and which direction he would have steered the US had he been elected as president.

On the flip side, Hillary won the primary, and was a clay candidate who would shape herself, and say, anything she needed to win.

Leaders are honest about their own convictions, and they stand up for their own beliefs, even when it's against the grain.

<TEXT> Always think about the issues that could arise in the future.

You may feel as though it was "bump and bruises", but for all you know there is some lasting damage in your neck or back.

If you work a job where you're on the computer all day, a neck injury could be catastrophic as you'll have a sore neck from it being in a certain position all day.

If you work a labour job, a back injury won't be fun to deal with.

If I were you, and if you can afford to wait, I would wait to see what arises in a couple of months.

These adjusters rely on getting you to sign a release ASAP before any lasting injuries arise.

In a past family case, my family member waited the entire statute of limitations, and when the notice of claim was submitted the insurance company didn't bother fighting them anymore and just paid the entire amount asked. All the lasting injuries were laid out, backed up by the family doctor and medical records. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Since iOS 10.0.2 none of my devices automatically update their apps. Is it the same for you guys? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I have a iPhone 6S, and one of the newer iPads.

My moms iPhone 6S has the same issue.

All of my mobile devices (iPhone, iPad) used to automatically update their apps when the device was:

1) Above a certain battery percentage and on Wifi.

2) Plugged in, and on wifi.

They used to immediately update the moment I plugged in the devices to a power source.

But since 10.0.2, they have stopped updating automatically.

Now they do automatically update, but it's not immediately anymore, it seems to happen randomly 5-8 hours after being plugged in. 

I don't know if this is an intentional change? If so it seems a little silly as I preferred the apps being up to date ASAP as the device hit wifi.

Anyone else have this issue still? I thought they would fix it with 10.1, but now i'm assuming it's intentional.

Here are some other encountering the issue:

No judge or corporate law firm would risk being caught even entertaining the idea. The integrity of the law is the only first and foremost expectation on the judicial systems plate. 

Which means interpreting and implementing the law without "prejudice no favour". Not making it.

For the government, and its representatives they are expected to represent the public. Which means making laws and passing budgets. 
Unfortunately, businesses and corporations fall under entities. While lobbying is bullshit, politicians need both financial and public support, reelections are expensive, even for incumbents. 

The courts don't need financial support because they are appointed. So if they enter into this lobbying and backroom bribery, it's only for self enrichment.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not a blanket response.

You also don't reside in the grey area.

When it comes to ethics and the behaviour of police officers, I'm pretty sure their code of conduct and due process isn't teetering on the "grey area".

As I responded to the other guy, I expect police officers to condone themselves in a way that upholds the integrity of the law, and the protection and respect for society while on duty. Whether the photo was supposed to be public is irrelevant.

And as I stated earlier, if this was a dead child who died in a car accident, would you be singing the same tune as though this shouldn't be viewed with empathy?

This idea that you're in the grey is just an excuse to stand back and let the chips fall where they may. I rather the chips don't fall where they may, and the police treat both dead and alive people with a modicum of respect and decency. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So thinking straight means that it somehow is acceptable to take a picture smiling while thumbing up over a deceased body?

The point is that while it may not be "illegal"; or a touchy subject along the grey area of morally acceptable:

a) many people would not want a police officer standing over their loved one, taking a picture smiling while thumbing up. They would question as to why this is occurring. They would also file a complaint, in which that complaint would be investigated, or the police organization would face scrutiny.

b) secondly, for the people emotionally involved with the event, then yes, it needs to be addressed in a manner that is ethical. There are ethics boards with people who are more aligned in the matter for a non-biased decision that a couple of redditors.

Lastly, anonymity is great on the internet isn't it? I don't see anyone out there publicly stating that it's acceptable behaviour, advocating the right to behave anyway they want.

Personally for me, I expect peace officers and law enforcement to behave in a way that upholds the integrity of the law, and respect and protection of society. Whether this photo was not *meant* to be public is besides the point. When you're on duty, be respectful, that includes to dead bodies.

The question is, if this was the dead body of a child, who was ejected from a car during a car crash, would he be doing the same thing? And if he was caught, would there be more public uproar? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sony customer support is one of the worst. 

Back in 2010 - 2011 I ended up buying a Xbox 360 slim just because Sony customer service pissed me off. 

I had downloaded a movie off the PSN network. It ended up being corrupted. It wouldn't let me re-download it again. So I re-rented the movie, and re-downloaded. I was with a girl I was seeing at 11pm at night on a Saturday. 

On the Monday I phoned customer service to get a refund for the first corrupted download. They told me they will do it, but because I didn't phone them right away it will be a one time thing and be goodwill on the company. Goodwill? I really wanted to flip my shit but let it go. 

I had other various issues with Sony Products and Sony customer service sucked in every instance. In fact for a lot of their products they outsource their support to 3rd party companies. 

The companies with the best customer service in my opinion are Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. Sony need to learn from these companies. 

If Sony didn't make the PS4 so amazingly well this console cycle I would have avoided them entirely based on their shitty customer service.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know if you're a Teksavvy customer or not, it sounds like you're not.

FACT: I was told by more than one customer service agent. Data caps are not in place in BC as they do not have access to track our Data usage.

When I log into my Teksavvy account to see Usage, it even says:

"Sorry, we are not able to display usage information for the services associated with your customer account. Please call support at 1.877.779.1575 for assistance"

So I called in, and they said the same thing every other customer service agent said. They can't track MY USAGE because Shaw doesn't give them this information, therefore my Data caps are not enforceable.

Unless you're a Teksavvy customer and have actually phoned in and inquired with an active account, don't copy and paste shit from Wikipedia. Secondly, when I had connectivity issues with my internet, the customer service agent said he COULD NOT assess my issue as they do not have access to these logistics.

Now when I phoned in for my TV cable, which is still with shaw, they could easily decipher my issue, they could reset my cable box, etc.

Teksavvy couldn't even reset my router for fuck sakes. So if they are considered as "last mile" infrastructure in BC, then they have absolutely minimal access. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How is our entire political system trash?

We have a similar system to yours, except our Legislative and Executive systems are fused.

It's called the "Responsible Government" model.

In fact, our system would be extremely beneficial to you Americans right now as it would allow your government to function without obstructionism from the salty Republicans.

While the separation of powers emphasizes checks and balances, it's really being exploited to halt any positive change for you guys. Obama had to manipulate through a universal system because the Republicans refused any such system. Had they been more open to helping the people, they could have facilitated a bi-partisan bill that wouldn't have had as many issues and holes as Obamacare. </TEXT>

1st Image:

Downloading Additional Content: 0%

Second Image:

Then after 3-4 minutes it shows a cancel button underneath the download bar, which I click that, and it takes me to the regular lobby window:


I'm confused right now as to whether I'm the only one experiencing this issue.

To try to fix it, I deleted war thunder from my PS4. I deleted the Settings save file from both the PS4 and the PSN cloud save. I then turned my PS4 off.

I turned my PS4 on, and downloaded a fresh copy of War thunder, which took 30 minutes. I then restarted my PS4, and when it booted back up, launched War thunder. Same issue arises. I normally wouldn't care, but needing to wait 3-4 mins for the cancel button to pop up is annoying.

Anyone else facing this issue? </TEXT>

Chretien and Martin left the country in a solid position, allowing us to weather the Mortgage bubble crash.

Harper mangled our GDP and economy as a whole.

And yes, Chretien and Harper faced recessions near the end of their terms, so you can't say it was all roses for Chretien's tenure.

<TEXT> Comparing Chrtien and Justin Trudeau is laughable. 

Chrtien was one of our greatest career politicians who left his final political position as the Canadian Prime Minister with Canada in a significantly better position. 

Trudeau is still in the process of early "testing". 

Not to mention Chrtien put together a star cabinet of career politicians. Where Trudeau has put together a cabinet of more politicians in the early "testing" phase. 

Politicians need to make and break promises. The other guys competing for the Prime Minister are doing it too. What matters is which promises you break. 

If you want to blast Chrtien for one thing, you can blame him for being in Clintons back pocket for NAFTA.

Also, while Prime Ministers of Canada (and myself) would love to legalize marijuana, you have the issue of international treatises that put our economic and social ties to our biggest trade partners at risk.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys, I have a little bit of an issue/quirk with Skype.

1st)

When I tell Siri to Call [Contact in IOS List] on Skype, it won't do it. It only calls people on my Skype Contact List. Is this intended? I was hoping I could call anyone in my IOS contact list without adding them all to my Skype Contact list.

2)

Some of my contact list, when I push the Call button (Just under the picture and name, it has 4 buttons (Message, Call, Video, and Other), it brings up a drop down menu that lists regular calls and then Skype calls.

But with other contacts it just straight out calls them regularly. None of these contacts are added to my Skype contact lists.


Thanks in advance to anyone who clears this up. </TEXT>

Most people use these guns for sport and hunting, not mass murder.

Therefore the manufacturer of the guns have a market defined by sport and hunting uses.

Now if every person who bought a gun went out and created mayhem and death, then sure, the gun manufacturers could be held accountable for providing the tools for these acts.

It's just a stupid lawsuit taking away resources and attention from the real problem of mass shooters. Lack of funding for mental healthcare, and closing the loopholes for screening on gun purchasers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No.

The only thing close to that is if you die on the operating table. 

But that only protects the doctor from unforeseen complications. If you can prove the doctor was negligent though, that protection goes out the window. If you can prove the doctor was grossly negligent or malicious he can even be on the hook for felony charges. 

You simply can't waive your right to life because it's a slippery slope. It could also be exploited.

<TEXT> Clearly these guys are suffering from severe mental illness if they find pre-pubescent/pubescent teens sexually attractive.

As a young kid myself between 14-18 I always found college aged girls absolutely irresistible. I really didn't find the stick and underdeveloped bodies of girls my age at that time all that appealing.

Bodies like this:

I think they just need to offer more funding for these guys who recognize they have a problem with pedophilia and maybe they can get them some discreet help, before the problem ends up causing them to spiral down a hole they can never recover from, which ultimately would endanger young children as they spiral down that hole.

Though, when an adult starts soliciting sex with underage children (especially 12-14 year olds), they should be prosecuted with the full extent of the law, regardless if they "fell through the cracks". </TEXT>

<TEXT> We could also argue that more people would play Pokemon Go, and possibly use the in-game app store if the game was more practical to play for the "on the go" person during the day.

I don't play pokemon go much these days (especially during the day) because I can't leave the app open for very long to track my progress as I need the juice on my battery. Now if they allowed push notifications and location services, then yeah, it would be more practical.

I have $50 bucks in coins still, but haven't had the time to use those coins for boosts of any sort.

Lets get going Niantec, the app being launched to track your buddy/egg progress drains the battery and isn't practical for daily work/recreational life.

<TEXT> The whole point of an election is for two (or more) candidates to fight it out and let the public decide who is the better candidate (or lesser of two evils, unfortunately), seeing who will run the country for the next 4 years. Being the POTUS is kind of a big deal, and your decisions have ramifications for the country.

If she can barely stand on her two feet, and has CLEAR AND OBVIOUS health issues, why doesn't she MAN UP and admit she is in no position health wise to run for election? These health issues also just add to her legal issues, and on top of that, we know she's in the banksters back pocket. Something the country is getting sick of, having banks through lobbyists run the country. Something Trump is vehemently against.

Why doesn't she let someone like Bernie Sanders take the Democratic seat, so we know that the POTUS for the next 4 years isn't going to let the banks run amuck, whether the POTUS is Trump or Sanders.

If she doesn't step aside, she clearly doesn't care about the citizens nor the country itself. </TEXT>

Or are the chips + pins significantly more difficult to manipulate in the scammers favour?

I've been wondering this because for some reason your consumer protection bureau's refuse to make the chip + pin mandatory in the US, which doesn't make any sense from a Canadian point of view as I would assume fraud would be reduced by more systems in place to prevent it.

So I'm wondering if the chip + pin is a false sense of security and the strip isn't much less secure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm hoping this trend gets bucked eventually.

When you use psychology and professional minds to fabricate a game in the hopes of draining players of their money, it isn't what I expected the gaming market to turn into.

It should be all about crafting excellent games with depth and care (ie. The Witcher series and others like it) and you're rewarded with success through being a genuine developer who cares about their gamers and consumers.

I know thats unfortunately a pipe dream right now, but hopefully we as gamers lash out at this freemium nonsense eventually.

Clash Royale is one of the best examples of developers who hired professionals to utilize negative emotions in sparking players to use real money. It's saddening. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you're misunderstanding my point.

My point is that 1 trillion passes through the American economy everyday. It has a $15 trillion a year GDP.

I know Canada has both positive and negative contributions to the international stage. But if Hillary were to have instead been the Prime Minister of Canada, it wouldn't be a big deal. Now if Hillary were to be the President of the United States, then yes this is a big deal, its a dire situation in fact.

As far as Canada and Russia's GDP comparison, Russia is also corrupt and full of criminals who lie, hence why no one wants to do business there. Russia is the country embodiment of Hillary Clinton.

My point, and i'll reiterate, is that in the scope of comparing countries like the United States to Canada, we are only a blip on the scale. We are Earth, they are Jupiter.

You sound like you have small dog bark syndrome, as though what we Canadians do means anything in comparison to when the United States throws its weight around. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're suggesting that Canada has any pull on the global level, in comparison to China, UK, Euro, or United States, then no, no one gives a fuck what Canada does.

Obviously once in a while Canada headlines international news with trade agreements, which lets be honest, we're the followers, not the leaders.

The United States leads..... countries follow, it has been this way for almost a century. The only reason we belong to the G7 is because the United States wanted it. We shouldn't even be in the G7. </TEXT>

But the reality of the situation is that the United States is the biggest player on the political field in our globalized world.

We as Canadians don't want a criminal, liar, and someone who's had a brain clot which caused her to "mishandle" sensitive information through emails, dealing with world economic and militaristic endeavours.

<TEXT> Fan boys are worse than SJW's. 

The price for the PSN used to be $0, something Sony used to market against it's competitor. I'm not poor, but it's nice not needing to pay for a service, you plug in your device, hook it up to your network, and voila, it works online.

Then they start charging for PSN; then a couple of years later they increase the price with no new features announced, and it's a GREAT thing.

Furthermore, you come along and offer a solid deal you found, which obviously was a solid deal as it's now SOLD OUT, and somehow in a past thread you were down voted.

The logic is strong on this sub. </TEXT>

When another company can come in and find the initial capital (billions of dollars) to come in a break up the colluding and monopoly the drug companies share, then this company will offer cheaper alternatives and the consumers will move to them.

Obviously this process could take 30-50 years and the people who needed the drugs will be depressed, broke, and dead long before this process completes. But fuck it, capitalism.

<TEXT> The same advice always applies to most adversarial court systems.

Dispute the ticket and hope the cop doesn't show up.

If the cop shows up, request a reduction in the fine.

If the cop refuses, you're really SOL. Not even a blue chip lawyer could argue his way out of a speeding ticket as the municipal/state/provincial foundations encompassing these systems are designed in a way that most of the burden of proof relies on the trust that the officer is upholding the integrity of such laws.

While I find this video cringey, I can understand why she fought it. Her friends tried to play counsel, and only when they got into the court room did they realize the judge wasn't going to have any of it.

Edit: There's this case on youtube where a regular layman fights a Motorcycle Helmet fine, and wins. He went in there calm, asked a few pertinent questions and the judge found in his favour that he didn't break any laws. I can't find it though. </TEXT>

A system like this would make Pokevision being shut down less of an issue.

Still though, Pokevision added something to the game that I still miss regardless if they add a tracking system like this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not selling out. It's providing a lot of Pokemon, Zelda, and Metroid fans a way to play their favourite games on their mobile phones.

A huge chunk of the western world has a smart phone now. Imagine if Nintendo released the older beloved titles of Pokemon, Zelda, and Metroid to those fans? They would make many people happy, and earn huge amounts of profit.

Too many people view this as a console war, unfortunately most adults who work, and have the disposable income to spend on these don't see it as a console war, but as a convenience mentality. If I don't feel like carrying a nintendo hand held with me, I'm not going to buy one, nor buy the games that come with it. Now if Nintendo released these older titles for iOS and Android, I would in a heart beat pay $10 to $30 for each title, since I can install them neatly into my mobile phone. </TEXT>

Me personally, I've never ever ever watched a show in terms of keeping up with new episodes. Game of Thrones is the only show I've ever kept current on. Even Breaking Bad I watched through netflix, and only one season of Better Call Saul, the second season I haven't even touched.

<TEXT> As an HBO show watcher, was it actually wise and good for him not to become king? Why would someone who was clearly wise and good as he comes off as, give up the throne to another Targaryan?

Wouldn't he had made an excellent leader? Even to the point, of resonating through his kin to become better leaders after him? Maybe even avoiding the "mad king" phase that caused the downfall of the Targaryans?

My point being, wouldn't the world had been better off with Aemon Targaryan as the king at one point in the GOT history? </TEXT>

I wonder why? Was it concern for Ned because he was an honourable man? Varys telling Tyrion that he had a quality and compassion for diplomacy during one of the episodes in season 4 or 5 expresses that Varys respects "good" leaders, including honourable ones.

The question is, doesn't Dranarys have a sense of honour much like Ned did? She is even more compassionate than he was. </TEXT>

I was really hoping he would have had magical powers during the battle of the bastards, but alas he's "normal". I still don't understand what the point of the "Prince that was promised", if he can't do some funky magic shit. But then again, people rally behind him and respect him. They put their lives on the line for him because they know he would do the same.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [EVERYTHING] From everything you've watched and read about GOT, Who would make the best king? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-06 08:13:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently made a post about Ned being king instead of Robert, and how that would have affected the realm. It seems like Ned would have been a better option, but not ultimately the "best" king.

Some mentioned John Arryn would have been a better king than Ned.

My question is, from the period of the Mad King being dethroned and killed, all the way till the period of the latest HBO Game of Thrones episode [Episode 7 Season 6], who would make the best King?

All characters are fair game.

Maybe also define what kind of qualities a king in the GOT universe would need to survive and rule successfully.

Personally, I don't know enough about the books to have input, I was always partial to Ned, and now I'm partial to Jon Snow. Jon Snow seems lately to get discouraged too easily, but he stands up for what he believes in (even dies for what he believes in), and values peoples lives.

I flip back and forth with Daenerys, she lacks that subtleness that John Snow has, where he seems to inspire peoples loyalty from his actions and demeanour. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [MAIN SPOILERS] Had Ned sat on the throne instead, would Kings Landing been like Winterfell in season one. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-04 07:43:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been re watching season one with my mom. 

I got her hooked on the show in season 3, and therefore she only watched new episodes. 

Decided to show her season one onwards while we have it on demand (streaming for free with the HBO subscription). 

She's been dreading the imminent death of Ned, and keeps saying, "why would anyone kill Ned?" 

It got me thinking. If instead of Robert Baratheon sitting on the iron throne, what if Ned did?

Would the situation in Kings Landing be better? Would it have been in debt? Would there have been as much backstabbing and scheming?  

Winterfell in season one seems so peaceful and prosperous. Would Ned have made Kings Landing the same way?

In The Republic by Plato, he states that the best rulers are the ones who do not want to rule, but rule because they are the best suited. Ned didn't sit on the iron throne, even though he could have. He also didn't want to be the hand of the king. 

During the series they mention potential replacements for Robert, but each one has a fault. Does Ned have any faults as a king? </TEXT>

<TITLE> First time Home seller. BC Canada. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-28 17:05:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys,

Dealing with selling a home in Vancouver, BC Canada. 

The home has been owned for over 8 years. It's also about 10 years old.

I have two questions:

We have a pending offer. According to the offer, after subjects are removed, and all the proper documents are signed, there will be a deposit held in escrow until the deal is completed and closed in September.

The proper documents are done by the lawyer in June, and the entire sum of money will be transferred in September.

Lets say, the couple buying the house doesn't have the money by September. Do we get to keep the deposit? How much of the deposit does the real estate agent keep?

The second question is according to the dual agency agreement:

The seller pays various fees. The two I have a question about are the:

Realestate Commission Commission (plus GST)

Goods and Services Tax (If applicable)

What are the difference between the GST on the Realestate Commission and the Goods and Services tax? 

Also, why are there brackets around If Applicable beside Goods and Services Tax? When is this not applicable?

Thanks in advance for any input. I really appreciate it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> May 19th, 2016 ---------------------------------------------------------

From Vryce,

Things are rocking. I know it does not seem like it but from my 
perspective, right now, things are rocking. If you have read the logs from 
beyond and the news you know why we hit a wall. Things are rocking now 
though and I just wanted everyone to know and to give me a another week or 
two. There are many awesome things coming and many events planned. Thank 
you again for your patience. 

Anyways I have an odd request. Most of you are founders. HELP FOUNDERS for 
more info. What will you found? It doesn't say! When will the FOUNDING 
happen? Soon! What are we founding!? What does that even mean? CHANGES 
UPCOMING shows when the founding happens, soon! We will start to market 
the game before that though, right after the next big feature, homes. 

So anyway oddly enough, to prepare for the founding we have the 'Log from 
beyond'. Yep, the game you play is OUT THERE, have faith, it is part of 
the plan and the plan is magic.

In preparation I need most of the founders to do something for me. I need 
*** Press return or Q to abort *** 

most of you to think deeply about something and email me one sentence with 
the subject as one word, God. The one sentence is - if you were 
interviewing God for the public, what is your first question? This is 
anonymous and only I will read it. Make it one sentence only. Make it 
real. Make it true. Think about it a while. If you were actually really 
interviewing God and this was not you emailing me and this is your one 
real communication with God, what would your first question be for God to 
answer and for the public and the masses of everyone to read for all 
eternity? What is your first question?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Email: vryce@medievia.com
Subject: God

One simple first question to God to answer for everyone to read.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please email me by the end of the weekend, so by the end of this Sunday 
May the 22nd. If you want to help me, this helps. It means I can keep 
working on coding the features and not have to think about what this big 
first question should be. I will read everyone's responses. I read and 
comprehend so very fast you cannot imagine. After reading enough I will 
*** Press return or Q to abort *** know what the question should be. There will be other questions but this 
is the first one so it is too important for anyone but the masses as a 
whole to ask. I should not be the one to decide. It would not have God's 
blessing that way. Medievia Gods and the enclave, I truly expect you guys 
to email me. Founders, I hope most of you email me. Everyone else, please 
by all means email me. Flood me with emails, all one simple sentence and 
that is it. Not one other word for me to read about anything else. 

You are interviewing God for the masses, what is your first question? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just so you know, it's been mainly my US thats been blinking. In fact, it's been blinking since the recent outage last week.

Secondly, my speeds are as per my plan, 35 up and 5 down. The connection seems stable, but, I've never had blinking DS or US issues, except for when I first got my service, and a simple power cycle of my modem fixed it.

Every time I power cycle my modem, it still has the US as blinking. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Vancouver: Teksavvy (Shaw infrastructure I assume) - My DS and US have been blinking past week. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-17 07:44:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My US has been blinking constantly for the past week. My DS was blinking for the past 2 days, but is now solid.

My Speeds don't seem affected as it's 35 down and 5.5 Up.

Just wondering why this is happening though, and if anyone else is afflicted in my area. I'm Burnaby/Vancouver region.

I'm assuming it's a channel bonding issue, and if these typically clear themselves up over a period of time. 

I recently had my first internet outage about a week ago also, so I'm assuming shaw may have had some update or overhaul to their system at that time, which last over a couple of hours.

I phoned into teksavvy tech support, and he wanted me to check my mode, but doing 192.168.100.1, wouldn't let me connect to my modem even though it was directly connected to my laptop through ethernet.

My modem is a Thompson DCM475 I think.

Thanks in advance for any input. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its not about more or less responsible. It's about the landlord providing a tenable dwelling.

Landlords are human beings though, and they make mistakes. It's up to you to draw attention to YOUR concerns. With that said, as I stated before, you should have approached your landlord and made it known that this is unacceptable, and the fact that heating must be provided to your dwelling isn't something up for debate.

Then you can move on and have your landlord provide an alternative measure, like providing a portable heating unit, or installing an individual unit heating system.

You can't sit idly by and accumulate "damages". Thats not how the courts work. You need to exhaust your options, then you can seek civil remedies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The dwelling MUST be tenable.

With that said, heating must be provided. But, the landlord at the lease agreement may charge you, or include such a service.

The problem is, you can't just sit there idly for months and then all of a sudden raise a grievance expecting restitution. You can approach her and ask her for some compensation for dealing with the cold for the past few months, but she is not obligated to do so. The proper way of doing it is, vocally raise your concern, then send them a written request, if they fail to rectify the issue, give them a warning that you will go to the tenancy board, if they still fail to fix the issue, file a complaint with the tenancy board.

Tenants have rights, but you must be both proactive and reactive when enforcing them for yourself. You can't sit there, accumulate "damages", then go after your land lord.

Next time, when you notice an issue, and bring it up to your landlord, give them an ultimatum, either they fix the issue, or you bring the issue to the tenancy board. </TEXT>

Absolutely erroneous this is being down voted. His issue isn't that complicated and a simple call to his tenancy board will outlay his rights and what the law says about what is a tenable and legal dwelling. 

"Get a lawyer", should only be for complicated issues where he would be evicted without remedy. He can barely afford rent, yet he should waste his time looking for a lawyer whom may or may not take his case *pro bono*.

Illinois is one of those states you are required to remove your plates.

<TEXT> Most states give you certain rights.

1) Notice of right to estimate. Which is supposed to give you a price and detail of the work, in which you can agree or disagree on moving forward with the work.

2) Detailed invoices which detail exactly what they are doing, plus the cost.

3) Any extenuating costs will be documented and presented to you prior to the work being done, where you can either agree to the costs and work being done, or reject them,

4) They must give you the right of taking your old parts back, as a record for you to keep.


Usually if you have issues with your repair, their is a paper and parts trail, where you can seek recourse through the auto shop first. If they refuse to rectify the situation, you'll need to go the civil route, and if you have evidence from all 4 of the rights I listed, then you should be able to prove that they didn't uphold their part of the deal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Has she already given him her house? Or she plans to after he declares bankruptcy?

Typically any acknowledged sums of money or property accrued, or known to be accrued are property of the bankruptcy estate if they are known prior to claiming bankruptcy + 180 days (6 months).

Now, if he were to come into possession of that property afterwards, *without* prior knowledge after filing bankruptcy + 180 days (6 months), he would be in the clear to keep his newly acquired asset.

So to be clear. 

He files bankruptcy. Anything he currently owns, or inherits is property of the bankruptcy estate. Anything after 180 days of declaring bankruptcy is his to keep. </TEXT>

One of the topics was domestic abuse, how stand your ground plays into it; also the brevity of battered women (partner) defense in such cases.

Domestic abuse, usually becomes one of those things that is mechanical between couples, to the point sometimes they don't even realize how loud and aggressive they become. 

If I were you, either:

a) ignore it and make a noise complaint.

b) phone the police every time you hear it.

They'll eventually stop being abusive (not likely), or move out (likely), because they won't be able to deal with the repeated police visits, or landlord intervening. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nearly every U.S. state has laws requiring sellers to advise buyers of certain defects in the property, typically by filling out a standard disclosure form before the sale is completed. (This responsibility remains even if you bought the house "as is.") The standard form usually asks the seller to state whether the property has certain features (like appliances, a roof, a foundation, systems for electricity, water, and heating, and more) and then rate or describe their condition. Some states' disclosure laws are more comprehensive than others, and if a feature isn't on the list, the seller may not be required to speak up. Also, the seller isn't usually required to scout out problems. But if there's clearly a place where the seller should have stated a problem but denied it, your job is to try to figure out whether the seller in fact knew about the problem. For example, if the seller patched over or hid problem areas, or if the neighbors have told you about the seller's efforts to deal with a problem, the evidence is on your side. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While statutory rape is applicable to strict liability in most states,I don't know whether transmission of material harmful to a minor would be. 

The reason I say this is largely due to how communication and chat infrastructures on the Internet work. If you're in an adult chat room and a minor pretending to be an adult comes into the chat room. Then how are you liable? Especially if you explicitly ask them their age and they reply with age of consent.

Are we all required to: request picture identification before interacting with people on the Internet? 

Like I stated in my original comment. If this had entered the physical world, then yes it becomes more complicated, which would include strict liability.  </TEXT>

Really important aspect is to keep any records where she states that she was 18. Screenshots of her profile depicting her age as 18, as well as any logs from text chat.

<DATE> 2016-03-20 21:38:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The fact that people play into these almost clickbait'ish articles from IGN and Kotaku is astounding.

Why would Sony create new hardware, slightly over 2 years since the PS4 release, they would:

A) Alienate their already 44 million PS4 customers

B) Fragment their current line up of games, and thus hurt their licensing profits since people would need to adopt the new hardware to purchase the PS4.5 games.

C) Go against their prospected 5-6 year cycle most developers have already advocated as Sony's plan.

D) Waste resources into a .5 (half tier upgrade), when they could instead invest in accessories that are compatible with the 44 million PS4 units.

Kotaku and IGN do this crap all the time.

They see the new "hardware unit box" that comes with the Playstation VR, which gives the PS4 more processing power to accommodate the Playstation VR's more demanding hardware requirements, and twist it into some bull story about some new PS4.

Had they instead said:

"Sony may plan to release a newer PS4 with the Playstation VR's hardware acceleration incorporated internally within the console itself. But essentially, regular non VR games, the units will be identical to previous PS4 units in capability."

This would make more sense.

I absolutely despise Kotaku's rumour mill, and how IGN will broadcast over and over and over the same garbage to fill slow news day voids. "Anonymous Developers" is a catchphrase Kotaku has invented.

<TEXT> Med was easily one of the best online games back in the late 90s. So many people on we had 1-2 forms constantly fighting in low/mid/high levelling zones on a daily basis.

Vibrant gods, contributors who would claw at Vryces front door to make zones and content. A cool system for Mudslinger contributions to earn donation items. Just all together a vibrant and active community, and though I hated the no cursing or trolling rules, I guess now that I'm older and have been exposed to other MMO communities like WoW (actually just WoW, Diablo 2/3), I have an appreciation for that cleaner old school Med community. 

I played from 97/98 to 99/00. Came back in late late 2015.

Now it's just like a dead horse. 

Where's the new content? Gear? New players. I log in and see 32 people, half of which are in BL's from guys who played in the late 90's. Where's the new people?

Also from what I've read, Vryce went a little cuckoo, he used to be a pretty reliable and chill guy, who would watch from afar but you knew he was there in the background making sure the game ran fluidly while the other people would contribute and put a diverse flavour to the game.

It's a shame too, Med NPK and CPK was absolutely the best shit ever conceived.

Albion online looks like it's mimicking a lot of Med's original NPK CPK zone segregation. So I guess some of Med's best features will live on in other games.

Here's hoping Vryce can turn this shit around, can't imagine an internet without Medievia. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Anniversary Bundles show coming soon? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm interested in the Heroic 6 month boost.

I started PS2 about 3 days ago, I noticed on the starter page, it scrolled "don't forget to pick up the anniversary bundle before it's gone"

The first day I started, I didn't notice the anniversary bundles even in the Bundles list. Today, they all of a sudden appeared, and have a "Coming Soon".

I'm wondering is this an error? Because when I go to buy it, it says "error".

My own research in the matter shows that the bundles (or specifically the 2nd anniversary bundle was available on Dec. 12 and 13th)

Thanks in advance for any clarification. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yharnam Sunrise, Childhood's Beginning, and Honouring Wishes is nonsense. It should have been a single trophy for beating the game. I have all the trophies except 2 of the 3 for beating the game. I'm halfway through the second trophy, but it really doesn't make sense for needing to beat the game 3 times differently. The trophies could have been put to better use.

At most, I'm hoping Darksouls 3 only has 2 game beating trophies.

Anyone else annoyed by this set up? Darksouls 2 has a single trophy for beating the game, I like that set up much better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get that Jerry wants to cut out the middleman, but I think it's time Jerry starts letting go of the reigns a bit and he can start by hiring an actual professional GM who actually knows what he's doing.

Been a Cowboys fan since the Aikman/Emmit Smith years, I was like 7 or 8 years old. It pains me to watch the Cowboys struggling when the problem is largely, in my opinion, Jerry Jones inability to put together a team who wants to show up to bleed and sweat for wins. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went 20 ish kills to 2 deaths last night invading people. I was shredding people in a single R1 chain. Not to mention taking on 3 guys at once with a 70% success rate. 

You could tell after I killed someone in under a second, they were looking at their TV screens wondering what the fuck I was using. 

I was only forced to switch to the pizza cutter to take on a group of 3 that refused to split up. 

Can anyone confirm the the Rakuyo is OP?

I'm also level 150 with 50/50 str/skill and almost 40 end. 50 Vit too. 

I'm just wondering because before this I never really invaded people before. It got so insane I had pairs of guys running away from me with no mobs around me to give them reason to run. 

Just a mediocre PvPers perspective on this. Have a good one. </TEXT>

Did they actually fix freezes at the beginning of battle? It causes you to crash into team mates tanks, making them think you're a griefer. I'm hoping they actually fixed it. </TEXT>

I'm wondering, if you go 30 str/25 skill, is that going to add ANY damage versus 25 str/25 skill? Or does it only take the scaling into account by the lowest common denominator, being 25 for skill?

<TITLE> With the release of Bloodborne and the change of style incorporated in this game, are you guys even excited for Dark Souls 3? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-13 13:36:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just started playing Bloodborne this past week, and I honestly feel like this game is superior in almost every way to Dark Souls. Dark Souls 1 was easily one of my favourite games. The atmosphere, the play style, the fact you knew you were going to die. It was such a refreshing change in video gaming experiences I have previously played. At the time I had both Skyrim and Dark Souls on my table, I fired up both, and I ultimately got hooked on Dark Souls passing Skyrim for a later time. It has this way of drawing you in, especially when you see those ghosts of fellow real life players run by you in a sewer tunnel etc, and then disappear. 

Bloodborne has taken this to a new level, the atmosphere is significantly better. The way the world connects and feeds into itself like the circulatory system of a real human body, it just feels alive. The combat in Bloodborne also feels significantly more involved. Weapons and armour feel more accessible, and play style options feel limitless. 

I was excited for Dark Souls 3, but now after playing Bloodborne, I'm not really all that excited anymore. In fact I hope Bloodborne takes the flag ship spot that Dark Souls currently holds.

Anyone else in the same boat as myself? </TEXT>
