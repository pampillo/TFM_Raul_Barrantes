<TEXT> I cant remember the first time Dog appeared in my life. In fact, I cant really remember a time that Dog wasnt there. Every memory is a little bit hazy, but as far as I know, Dog has been following me around for quite a while. 

After my mother died, I had to go through all of my familys old belongings to clear out the house. I picked up a couple pictures from my childhood. It didnt matter what day it was, or the time, or the year. Dog seems to be in every picture. Right down to the day I was born. There is a faded hospital picture; my mother is smiling proud and Im a newborn wrapped in her arms. There is a shadow lurking in the corner. Its nine feet tall with arms that hang almost to the floor. Its claws appear threatening and it has a grin that always keeps you spinning.

Thats Dog. 

He earned his name when I was five years old. I guess in my innocent child mind, his appearance resembled a dog. My parents, like any normal parents, assumed him to be an imaginary friend. They found it a little peculiar that my imaginary friend was a dog, but played along until I turned 10. After that, anytime I brought up Dog I was scolded about how I was too old to be making things up in my head. It was then that I realized I was the only person who could see Dog. 

There was only one place Dog didnt follow me into it. Church. Every Sunday, my mother would dress me and my brother up and take us to the nicest building in town. I liked Church, unlike my brother. I found something there that for a second, made me feel like a whole person. I loved learning all the rules to life. I believed in God, knew my Judgment Day would come; so I listened so attentively. I sat at home and read the bible from cover to cover, read between every line and built myself in the image of God.

Dog would sit quietly next to me. Sometimes, I almost forgot he was there. But as soon as the book was closed and placed in the drawer, Dog was there. His claws around my neck. Dog told me I was a sinner. I would always be a sinner. I was born with the sickness. There is no cure for the sickness. 

I didnt use to believe Dog. I believed the Church when they said they could cure me. I believed I could find salvation. But now I know. Now I know, Dog is right. Dog is always right. 

I tasted sin. I learned to love sin. And now, theres no turning back. 

Sometimes, I peer into the other cubicles at work. I see cubicle after cubicle covered in pictures of loved ones: husbands, wives, and children. I get to mine and Im surrounded by blank space. Cream colored agony in the shape of walls. I wish I had a desk filled with pictures of the person I once loved. 

Im passed the point of wishful thinking though. Right now, Im at home writing one last letter to my dearest.

_To my dearest Jeremy,_

_At night I go home and I dream about you. Were always standing at the edge of the world. You tell 
me to jump on three but you always let go of my hand on two. And then Dogs there. He grabs onto my hand and counts to three. Thats usually when I wake up._
 
_Ive since passed the point of missing you. I never thought I would. When its 3:57 pm on a Tuesday, 
you are not the thought thats passing through my head. Your names been engraved at the bottom 
of a whiskey bottle. I see your face through an empty glass. Sometimes I miss missing you but I 
cant. Dog is always here, always here holding my hand._

_I remember when we first met. You were new in town and I was still the uptight, scrawny teenage 
boy that got picked on in the hallways.You flashed me a smile as you walked to your new locker. 
That day you turned my skin to fire. I believed I would eventually be ash._

_But now youre gone and with your absence, the burning is gone too. You know, when the paper 
published that article about you, they said your death was an accident. But I knew the truth, 
Jeremy. We were sick. We were so sick Jeremy. At least, thats what we thought._

_When I sat in the Chapel, hours after your funeral, I realized something I think I had known for a 
long time. The bible didnt have the answers I was looking for. The Church, well they had told us we 
were sick for so long and I had believed them. But as I sat there, staring holes into your coffin, it 
became so apparent that whatever this was, it was not because we were sick._

_I mean, it couldnt be_

_That day, I walked out of the Chapel and finally embraced Dog. He went to wrap his claws around 
my neck, but I had stopped him and instead grabbed his hand. We walked home together._

_After that, Dogs whispers became yells. I tried everything I could to quiet the noise but no matter 
what I turned to, his screams only got louder. The Church had told me you would destroy me. In           
some ways, you did. I finally started listening to Dog again. I know you always told me not to. But 
without your voice here to fill the silence_

_I know Ill see you again. Were sinners right? I know Ill see you in Hell. Maybe there well find the 
silence we were looking for._

_Dog started to dictate my life again. Dog told me to quit my job, so I did. Dog told me to give up 
painting, so I did. Dog told me to stop talking to my brother, so I did. Dog told me to stop trying, 
so I did. Dog told me nothing mattered anymore, and I believed him. I got so use to listening to 
Dog that when he told me to tie a rope around the overhead beam in my living room, I did._

_Last night, I sat on the hill overlooking the cemetery you were buried at. I watched the sky turn 
from a pasty blue to a canvas of colors Ive only ever dreamed about to a black darker than any of 
my nightmares. I blew smoke from my lungs and wondered how it was possible to be so alive yet so 
empty. I watched the smoke rise. Watched it get twisted, pulled, pushed by the cold, biting wind. I 
asked her why she was so cruel. My only response was a gust so strong it unlit my cigarette. Dog 
placed his hand on my shoulder and grinned at me. Ive been spinning ever since._

_I can see the rope dangling from where Im sitting, writing this letter now. Dog is sitting by my 
side. Hes quiet. Dog hasnt been this quiet in years. The silence is making my head pound. There is 
an absence in my stomach so prominent, I feel like throwing up. Before today, these four walls have 
felt like they were caving into me. But right now, I can see so clearly._

_My dearest Jeremy. I loved you more than you can ever know. Together, I believed we could be 
smoke. Wisps of grey that moved so freely in the wind. Now I know I was wrong._

_We could never be smoke. All we are is sin, skin and bone._

_Tonight, I know well be together again._

_Yours sincerely_

I know Im not the only one who has a Dog. Ive been lucky enough that Ive seen him all my life. For some of us, we can never know when hes lurking. We can never know when his claws are reaching towards us, millimeters close to our skin. Once he gets his claws in you, hell never let go. It starts with whispers and you might think its okay until it turns into screams. Once his voice is loud enough to fill the silence, well my friend, Im afraid there is no going back. 

Dog has a special way of finding just what makes you sick. Hell take every dark cloud in your mind and make them rain. They will pour out into every crevice of your body until even the blood you bleed comes out black. 

His claws will continue to dig and dig until there is nothing left. My dearest Jeremy had tried his hardest to break me free but Im almost afraid thats what drove him to his death. Thats why tonight, I am relinquishing my life to join him. Im most certain I will end up in Hell. 

I climbed up the ladder in the middle of my living room and placed the rope around my neck. I cant help but laugh as I imagine what it would feel like to jump right now and have this coarse rope break my neck.  I can feel the coarseness of the rope rubbing the calluses on my hand. I know what I must do to make this end. 

I stepped down from the ladder and glanced at Dog.

Hes grinning again.

Dog bends down to my height and I wrap the rope around his neck. Dog wraps his claws around my own neck. Were both grinning now as we tighten the hold we have on each other. I watch his grin slip as he realizes he cant breathe.

An eternity passes by and Dog finally lets go.

Dog isnt grinning anymore. I am though, as I walk out of my house into the cold night. I step onto my front porch and press my face against the window. I can see Dogs body swinging from the rope. I step back and smile at my own reflection. I laugh as I notice the blue and purple marks around my neck.

I feel at peace as I watch Dogs body turn into smoke. The wispy grey and silver strands curl up into the air before vanishing from sight. I grin again as I realize how much it costs to be smoke.

<TITLE> Something weird is happening to the water in my apartment (part 1) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-19 23:53:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It started with the water. Every single faucet in my small 1 bedroom 1 bath apartment was pouring out dirty, brown water. I called my landlord fearing it was a problem for the entire building. To my surprise, I was the only complaint. It seemed damn near impossible to me considering we all share pipes, but stranger things have happened. He sent a plumber to my place the next day. 

It seemed it was just as I thought. Iron was contaminating my water. The plumber poured CLR down my drains and told me to let every faucet run on top pressure for twenty minutes. He said if that didnt get rid of the brown color, to wait another half an hour and try again. It worked after two tries. I thought that was the end of it.

I was wrong. 

The next day, same thing. Brown water. Frustrated, I went to the store after work to pick up CLR and take care of it myself this time. Only, after hours of trying to flush out the potential rust, the water was still coming out brown. I rang up my landlord again but it instantly went to a pre-recorded message.

On vacation for the week. Leave a message and Ill get back to you first thing Monday. Thank you.

Of course, just my luck. I looked through all the paperwork I was given upon signing the lease but nothing had the number for the plumber. I wasnt surprised. My landlord was shit. In fact, this whole complex was shit. Things were constantly falling apart: water stains on the ceilings, faulty air conditioners, graffiti in the stairwells. But I couldnt afford much else living paycheck to paycheck as I was. 

I could last a week though. It was just one week. I could buy those large water jugs from the supermarket and just hold off on taking a shower. It would be okay. 

That night I woke up at 3 am with the driest throat in the world. Every breath I took led to the feeling of sandpaper being pulled down my pharynx and to my esophagus. It was excruciating. I grabbed a glass and poured out some of the water from the jug I had bought a couple hours before I had gone to bed. I drank and drank but the feeling persisted. It felt like it was getting worse. Desperate, I pulled the cap off the jug and chugged the entire thing. Five gallons of water and it still felt like I had shards of glass embedded in my throat. 

With tears building up in my eyes from the pain and out of clean water, I toyed with the idea of just drinking from the faucet. Was it dangerous? How much iron could I consume before it was an actual danger to me? I mustve been standing there at the faucet for a long time because I blinked and the dimly lit room was casted with the glow of the clock telling me it was 4 am. Strangely, the feeling went away. 

Relieved, I went back to sleep. 

The next night, the same thing happened. I woke up around the same time with a burning in my throat that had me yearning for more water. I drank and drank and drank. This time I had bought several jugs. I must be coming down with something. I continued to drink and drink and drink but it seemed like the burning was only spreading down my esophagus into my lower sphincter. Once I was out of clean water, I turned my attention to the faucet. 
My thoughts were the same as last night. How much iron could I consume before it was an actual danger to me? 

As I peered at the faucet, I swear I began to hear a voice urging me to drink.

The voice was brittle and croaky, as if it were dealing with the same pain as me. The gravelly voice seemed like it was coming out of the air vent in swirls until it reached my ears. I could almost feel a faint breath on the back of my neck although the voice sounded far away. 

Im so thirsty. So very thirsty. Water. I need waterthirstyso thirsty

I felt hypnotized despite the voice being so grating rather than soothing. I found my body moving by its own accord. I felt water pouring into my mouth, soothing my scorching throat. The hoarse voice continued to encourage me, professing its own thirst and need. I kept drinking until the voice slithered away and suddenly I was snapped back into reality.

Realizing my head was under the kitchen faucet, brown water pouring into my mouth, I sputtered in surprise. I jumped back and spit out the remaining water in my mouth, nearly scrubbing my tongue with my fingers to try and get out any lingering molecules. I dont know what came over me, but it mustve been due to long hours at the office, little sleep and whatever illness I was coming down with. 

A little perturbed, I went back to my bedroom in hopes for just a couple more hours of sleep before work.

The next night I was awoken at 3 am again. This time not due to my throat aching, but someone knocking on my door. Groggily, I sat up in my bed wondering what someone could possible want at this time in the morning. Slightly annoyed, I got up and walked into the living room. The knocking turned faint, as if they were just taping their knuckles gently on the door. Despite there being a door between us, it almost felt like they already knew I was standing on the other side. 

Since I live in a crap area, I wasnt just going to open the door. I went to peer through the peephole and the knocking stopped. I paused for a second thinking they mightve left but I still leaned forward to get a glimpse of who it could be.

Someone, or should I say something, was standing there. But he had his back turned to me. Whoever he was, he appeared to be shirtless. He was thin with the most awful, greyish, shriveled skin. Perhaps a homeless man? His head had little hair left, only long, stringy patches. It had to either be a homeless man or a tweaker, or hell both. 

I was about to back away when he suddenly whipped back around and pressed his face directly to the peephole. I screamed in fright, jumped back and tumbled to the floor.

That was not a man.

Whatever was standing at my door was nothuman.

He had the same face structure as a human: eye sockets, a nose, the outline of a mouth. But there was the same grey and wrinkled skin stretched over all of it. 

It began to pound on my door. The sound echoed in my apartment. My heart was pounding just as hard, my breaths coming out fast. I couldnt feel my legs, much less stand back up. 

It was pounding so hard on my door; it was rattling almost out of the frame. The only thing keeping it from busting open was the door chain. 

Thirsty.so thirsty.water. I need water

It was the same voice from last night only instead of being hypnotizing, it felt almost like a threat. It kept repeating that over and over again as I was frozen in terror. I mustered up as much courage as possible and shouted that I was calling the police even though my cellphone was charging in my bedroom.

It let out a deep, raucous laugh that sent shivers down my spine. 

The kitchen faucet suddenly turned on at full pressure, blowing brown water everywhere. His pounding continued to rattle the door and his voice shrilly resonated in my apartment. 

I sprung to my feet and ran to the kitchen. I turned off the kitchen faucet, getting water all over me. As soon as the water stopped pouring, the pounding stopped as well. My heart was nearly jumping out of my chest and I stayed frozen next to faucet, not even a breath escaped my lips. 

I could hear heavy footsteps like it was leaving. I let out the breath I was holding and walked towards the door. I stayed there staring at it. I dont know how long passed but I eventually built up the nerve to peer through the peephole again. 

Nothing was there. 

I felt a bit relieved and unhooked the chain lock to open the door. There was some sort of black slime covering the area on the door he was pounding on. Its smell was so rancid, I nearly threw up. I covered my nose and looked down the dimly lit hallway making sure whatever was just at my door was gone. 

Nothing was there so I closed the door, locked it back up and turned on every light in my apartment. I didnt sleep for the rest of the night.

**

Guys, I dont know whats happening but theres something weird going on in my apartment. Its the morning now and Im writing this out because I dont know what to do. I cant call the police. Theyll probably just tell me it was a homeless man or drug user or something.

But I know what I saw.
 
Thatthing was not human.
 
The water is coming out even darker than it has been. Its almost black now. Im scared for tonight. I might just sleep at the office instead. Its Wednesday and my landlord wont be back until Monday to call a plumber. Though Im starting to think the color of the water has nothing to do with the plumbing. 

If anyone has any idea what could possibly be happening, please please let me know. Im one more step away from calling a fucking priest to come and bless the place.
