<TITLE> Poet Max Ritvo passed away at 25 last year, I was reading his NYTimes obit which struck me deeply with its ending on this incredibly powerful note </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-08 12:13:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> His poetry sustained him, his family said. He said the day he stopped writing, that would be the end of it, his wife said in an interview. She added: He was writing three days before he died.
  
On Monday, Dr. Ritvo-Slifka said, her son was too weak to write poetry.  
  
Thats it, she said quoting him. I cant write any more.  
  
The family called in the hospice nurses, who gave him sedatives. He died the next morning.

<TEXT> I want to point out the first time I heard this song. I think I was sixteen maybe 13 years ago and I had been reading this book by Terrence McKenna that supposes that part of the evolution of our sophisticated cerebral cortex is due to when we were monkeys, we ate psilocybic mushrooms and expanded our mind. I found this website, www.elftrance.com, which is really something to behold. and [this video](https://youtu.be/ZXRAmX5BaOw?t=1m57s) which uses sandstorm as the moment a monkey realizes *self* thanks to consuming mushrooms. </TEXT>

Be honest about their agenda, what it really means for America. And since the Republicans are the party of the past, to contrast that Democrats need to clearly define how they are the party of the future, and they must completely and clearly define what a bright future of America *should* look like. It's time for big balls politicking.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw my own father on death's bed. He lost his job in the recession and receded into wine bottles. For months he did nothing but drink wine. Would go to the grocery store at 10 am, pick up bottles and swig all day. He was in such a delusion. I spent every day trying to snap him out of it, but to no avail. It was brutal, seeing the kindest sweetest smartest man I knew get reduced to a zombie, his soul was taken from him. One day I was upstairs my sister yelled I ran down he was on the ground convulsing. He had gotten so saturated the liquor had won over.   
  
Ambulance came took him away. He seemed moribund. We went to the hospital and they did what they do. Then they knocked him out. On the bed he was a bloated, shapeless, sallow form. He was not my father. Just this molasses colored blob. When eventually he came to, he didn't know what was anything. He kept trying to escape, pulled the catheder out, didn't know us.   
  
That was some six years ago. He made it out, did rehab, and been clean since. [Here he is](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55805638e4b03608a941dabc/558245a6e4b0e4c2b1545bde/56bb7cae859fd0422da8d452/1455127729894/8mqO6DO.jpg?format=750w). Works out every day, rides his bike, back in form. That good man that got pulled under got the second chance, and he has made the most of it, spreading good in all he does. I am so freaking blessed, I don't know who I'd be now if the end of his story had been as a blob on a bed. Me and my two sisters still all have dreams where he starts drinking again. Thank all that life gives those who want it their second chance. </TEXT>

All while acting petty as all fuck, and just really distasteful and unbecoming of the office. And they've made such a multitude of unforced errors that they're definitely evil... but fortunately totally incompetent, which means less evil gets done. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree. That's for two reasons: one, I'm just not as fluent in it as I am in other things. two, it's reeeallly hard to put hip hop/rap in a mix that isn't a hip hop rap mix. It really just is too different a vibe, all it's own, that many of those songs I feel break the jive of a mixed-genre playlist. I could be wrong, just my opinion. </TEXT>

This has been here before, but I've since retooled it greatly, and it's almost doubled in length now. There's no hitting every genre mark, and I'm sure I have glaring oversights-- for those failings, I apologize. My general gauge for a good song is it has to move you: either emotionally or physically, on another level.  
  
As always, would love to hear recommendations, playlist recs, or playlist discussion too--  
  
Thanks and have a great day!

<TEXT> At that time, though, half were also given wearable tech devices that monitored their activity and connected to a website to help provide feedback. All participants were followed for 18 more months.  
  
At the end of the two years, which is pretty long for a weight loss study, those without access to the wearable technology lost an average of 13 pounds. Those with the wearable tech lost an average of 7.7 pounds.  
  
Its hard for many to accept, so Im going to state the results again: Those people who used the wearable tech for 18 months lost significantly less weight than those who didnt.

<TEXT> Still can't believe how many people are cheering Russia on, or ignoring this completely. It's no wonder the_donald peddles so deeeply in memes and distractions, if they had to debate they'd be fucked. Trump is doing his best to feed them ammo with his bullshit but the truth is this administration is not only a total shitshow circus but also possibly implicatable in some serious treason.  
  
**Edit:** I intentionally wrote this post to invite argument and counterpoint from a Trump supporter. 17 hours later not even a troll response. Interesting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree. He is speaking out strongly, against Trump, but voting as a member of his party. [Watch his remarks in Europe yesterday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNeLmjuMtIU app=desktop) and see what it does to your opinion of the man. Every time he comes up folks bash him on his votes. But, it doesn't seem like that is changing, so if outspokenness is the best we got, I say we take it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I said this before, here's what should be done:  
The town halls should be held/formed anyway. Have them be platforms for individuals to speak out on how the Republican moves/Trump EO's are affecting their lives. A forum for venting. Bring democratic candidates in as well. And create options for folks to sign up to run for office.

For instance, the first person in the advertising one, it took me two seconds of googling to figure out the building he works in.

<TEXT> They uh... are really, really in trouble with the repeal. They had 8 years of screaming to repeal it. Now they finally can. First they were going to do it in a few days. Then a few weeks. Now Trump says not until the end of the year/sometime next year.   
  
I almost wonder if they didn't oppose it and make it a boogeyman simply to whip up hatred against Obama and feed teaparty rancor, and that they only meant the "repeal" part of "repeal and replace" -- they never actually thought out what "replace" was going to be.   
  
We're all very curious Republicans, what, in those 8 years, did you propose? While meanwhile, *millions* gained healthcare, expanding to the greatest number of folks covered ever. While *millions* who would have been denied coverage because of pre-existings were getting coverage. While kids were able to stay on their parents coverage until 26 (something I myself benefited from).  
  
While all that was happening, and you were screaming about how evil it was, did you remember to think of "replace"?  
  
Go ahead, and replace it. Do it. And we will replace you. </TEXT>

Imagine, if you have to, that he's innocent and has thousands and thousands of people in a fever dream over him being a pedophile. Imagine if you had thousands of people everyday calling you a pedophile. And these people have already been shown to bring rifles into places for no reason. /R/conspiracy is now complacent in this proxy doxing. Massive witch hunts of individuals based on flimsy evidence. Do you need to provide an address to dox? I don't think so. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dear Senator Thurmond:  
I write to express my sincere opposition to the confirmation of Jefferson B. Sessions as a federal district court judge for the Southern District of Alabama. My professional and personal roots in Alabama are deep and lasting. Anyone who has used the power of his office as United States Attorney to intimidate and chill the free exercise of the ballot by citizens should not be elevated to our courts. Mr. Sessions has used the awesome powers of his office in a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly black voters. For this reprehensible conduct, he should not be rewarded with a federal judgeship.  
I regret that a long-standing commitment prevents me from appearing in person to testify against this nominee. However, I have attached a copy of my statement opposing Mr. Sessions confirmation and I request that my statement as well as this be made a part of the hearing record.  
I do sincerely urge you to oppose the confirmation of Mr. Sessions.  
Sincerely,  
Coretta Scott King </TEXT>

Those feeling somewhat uncomfortable with how this administration has played out.. You are going to have a hell of a time defending him the coming years (days?) you will lose friends when people automatically think you're a moron for buying his snake oil. You will find yourself having to defend increasinly bizarre and anti-american ideas. However, admit you were wrong, and folks will forgive you. No one will hold it against you. Mistakes happen, he did sell masterfully. But if you've seen through the charade now, feel no obligation to continue to defend him. You have every right to be outraged too. Defending this man, choosing to believe this, will increasingly strain your life, as the paucity of his principals becomes more evident. And as you see just how poorly snake oil burns. </TEXT>

Banned funding for abortion programs abroad (note: just giving advice on it, not performing (this is in AIDS dense areas too))  
Banned immigrants from seven *muslim* countries, only one of which has ever had a terrorist attack the US (and who failed to kill anyone)  
The Vice President spoke at an anti-abortion rally    
Bannon said the media needs to "keep its mouth shut"

Optioning to reopen black prisons, suggesting a return to torture  
Wasted days arguing the number of attendees at inauguration  
Suggested that 5 million illegal immigrants voted in the election, based on no evidence, but will start an investigation using tax payer money, anyway

Aka, we gave up the name of the guy who provided the info to Russia, who arrested him for treason. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To all who so far took a "let's wait and see" approach. I did not take that approach, and already this is going far worse than I even anticipated. I can only hope that the resistance to this unfettered capitalism will grow as a result.   
  
Folks, if you want to really fight the destruction of the earth, you must overcome one piece of programming that has been ingrained into all of us: the need to buy. All our American lives we have been told that to live, is to acquire more things. But we must enter an age of realization that even if all our electricity was reusable, and all our cars electric, we would still be doomed. That is because every single purchase we make taketh from the Earth. Every single cup of coffee you buy, computer, piece of furniture, car, etc. All of it is one notch, however small. So what to do? On a large scale, it's an impossible catch 22, stop buying and the economy collapses. Yes. But I can more about Earth than I do about jobs.   
  
If you really want to resist our own destruction, the simplest thing you can do is purchase used things. I myself can make an example: I have not bought any furniture in three years. New clothes in one year. The only thing I've really bought at all is used books and groceries (and beer). Every time you decide to buy, every single damn thing, is a part of what is happening to our earth. Please know this. And know that you are making decisions that affect this, and feed this billionaire bastards. *You* **are** in control. </TEXT>

Don called him first thing in the morning to thank him and confirm he was very committed to that thing they talked about before. And what is good for Donald is good for all of us! Why should we question him now? He's the president! He's *our* leader. What has questioning authority, no matter who got them put in power, done for anyone! We need stability now not these silly lesbian parades! If we're going to rebuild America we all need to stop worrying about petty things and hit the ground running on day one! Just like Donald did! I can't believe anyone let this happen, but now that it has, let's fight freedom!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Know what's cool? Yesterday was my sister's birthday and we all were gathered at a lunch, and everyone single one of them started railing against Donald. One by one everyone cited various things that had happened, even that day-- they were clearly aware and taking note. I have always been an assiduous follower of news out of Washington, but never in my life have I heard any of them discussing these matters. Later on I caught my mom reading an article on her phone about how just because he is the president doesn't mean you have to support him. People are getting woke out there. I'm not saying Donald is a good thing, but sometimes evil can inspire good people more than good people can inspire good people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who has visited here for years, has accumulated 450,000 karma for posting thoughtful insights and information, current have 9 months of gold to spare- versus yourself, a 5 month old account with less that 2,000... I am not one of your "boys." So let me breakdown your bullshit, since this is really a case study here.   
  
1. CTR is back boys. -- what does that mean? do there seem to be a surge of people not buying your bullshit? people are starting to see Trump for what he really is? I realize that in your simple, reductive logic you perhaps legitimately do think anyone who hacks at Trump is somehow.. I guess.. paid to do it. If that mindset gives you solace, please, enjoy it. However, the last few days have had a string of information that should make even the most sycophantic wonder at what is going on. There is nothing wrong with questioning your beliefs, and there is everything cowardly with using base name calling as your weapon of choice.   
2. Keep your guard up and stay strong. -- This legitimately sounds like propaganda. 
3. Pizzagate will be exposed soon. -- I have not seen this story gain any information since the emails. There is no new leads, no new intel. I would say, if anything, "Pizzagate" is about to crumble under the weight of its own lack of story to propel itself. I would say give it a month and about 10% of the people who have been talking about pizzagate will be. However, please, let me know when your incredible bombshell drops and in the mean time be sure to completely ignore all the red flags of Trump dropping all around you.

<TEXT> You totally editoralized this headline tho my friend. They didn't day the intel was fake or fake news. Appearently the only information here is that the officials didn't leave the 2 page paper copy of the summary of the allegations, but only briefed orally. You left this out of your "gems" information. The article itself says what buzzfeed said from go, that this is unverified information. NBC did not contradict Buzzfeed here, only I suppose officials who said they gave Trump team a brief. But way to hyper editorialize your headline so as to make it seem like the whole story is bunkiss. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Article changed url:** It's [here now](http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/07/us/russia-hacking-election-trump-voters.html) thanks /u/Publius_JR for pointing this out.  
  
My understanding of this is pretty simple. Who you vote for is a *huge* part of one's identity, and so to acknowledge the Russian's acts as true would undermine their identity. They would have to admit that their guy is Russia's guy. They would have to admit that they were in part duped by the Russian trick, and that they advanced Russia's goals and interest, however unknowingly.  
  
So to be sympathetic, they are boxed in: admitting this is real means admitting they voted for a counterfeit candidate, and therefore their identity as Americans takes a big hit. They can't let it be real, because then they are less real. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah so I did some investigating. [Dude was *on*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Froman) the transition team. This was literally his job. It wasn't some shadow banker. It was fully public that his job was to pick people for the admin, along with 11 other people. So he did his job. Also has a long history of politics, including being in the Clinton White House. So tell why a transition manager should not... pick people for the transition? Please. Answer me directly: should a guy publicly in charge of picking people for the administration.. should he do his job? Yes or no.

<TEXT> For instance, Obama's entire administration, diplomats, etc were picked over his head even before he was elected.   
  
Show me something that says that.  
   
Now Trump is getting flack for taking time AFTER actually being elected to personally assemble the same. I love that Trump is not giving pay-for-play-ambassadors any leeway.  
  
Yeah usually candidates have this all sorted out before hand so when it comes time to transition they can focus on other shit. Either Trump is an irresponsible moron or really didn't think he'd win. He's not being exemplary, he is being unprepared. He should have had his list months ago.

<TEXT> I really wish we could know just how much of the general discussion this year was fomented, steered, and distracted, even here on old Reddit, by the [Russian Troll Army](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html). One of my own personal beliefs, which again I wish could be verified beyond my impression, is that the style of disagreement we have seen here by the "pedes" is to create fake news on the individual level, or never respond to the question at hand, but distract by making up information. Take for instance the "evidence" thing here. My simple response was, if this was untrue you'd see Republican senators, who had the evidence and never one to waste a chance to frame Obama as wrong, going to the media and twitter saying it was fake. Not one did, in fact the opposite. The response was always "but where's the evidence." When asked directly, specifically, a question, they never answer, even when you press. Dodge and distract.    
  
Now, I think that these master troll tactics were brought around places like Reddit by Russian. Because we saw the same sort of tactics deployed here during the Ukraine Crisis, which preceded the election. What I find most interesting, is that because noting its effectiveness (nothing ever has to be answered for, and the method of distract and dodge can go on into perpetuity) the American "pedes" took up the same style and tactic, essentially and unwittingly becoming a proxy internet army to the Russian operation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I chose my battle, I believe that speaking as crudely as he did leads me to assum his point is pointless anyway. And it is, so here: the DNC hack gave minimal info, really. Hillary wrote none of them. She didn't write the Podesta ones either. However everyone acts like Hillary personally sicked her dogs on Bernie, when rather it was that lifelong democrats felt a bit hijacked   upended by Bernie. Imagine your sister marrying a guy, then a month later he is trying to tell your entire family how to run the family. It was unfortunate that the source material for the DNC   Podesta was emails because it meant months more of the word "emails" being repeated and people just assuming it meant more Hillary craftwork. Now on the other hand if you enjoy your elections being manipulated by an outside government, when there were very little "truths" exposed, then I have nothing further to add. </TEXT>

The way they blindly instantly accept dubious allies, gleefully lash out at our oldest allies, cheer on the punishment of people based on no evidence.. is how people end up in concentration camps. Honestly if Trump says jump they do, so what if Trump says my administration is being threatened by a jewish cabal? Or by all muslims? What will those folks who question nothing do?

<TEXT> It doesn't matter fella. If we had presented like, say, emails as evidence, do you really think they would not have found another arguing point? Of course they would have. It's part of the fake news era. They always jump in front of you with some distraction claim, rather than address the substance at hand. Another thought on this: it was funny, sometime around Saturday morning all of putin's babies found their talking point at the same time: "evidence" -- literally, I was following all this quite closely and was posting on it, got hundreds of "evidence" responses all at that time. It's like they get their talking points from a ministry of insecurity or something.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He would die just a little more than a month after [this was recorded](https://youtu.be/fLw7P_LATOQ?t=1m49s). I've skipped to the solo.  
  
You can hear his searing soaring spirit as he rips the almight out of this song. Even just the way every single player is ready for the solo to explode from the end of the chorus, and boy does he kick off. Switching with perfectly matching attitudes against Dickey Betts. Continually returning to the main theme but making it new each time. It simmers up it simmers back down and gradually, a tension is built that unleashes in a heaven cascade of shimmering sound. I say that if you wish to fully enjoy it, as it is a journey, is to not listen will doing anything else than listening, and led him take you along his on this sky ride. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What matters to me in this... is that Abbey Road was written as the last. I think if this were commonly understood, what they were doing would be better understood. They were saying goodbye. Side Two is the last hurrah, the combination of everything they've done sewn together into one single dear farewell. Hence "In The End" was the end, it was saying goodbye, with that one last piece of truth. I don't know if they knew it would be the end, but I have a feeling they had a feeling, and so they made their goodbye the best album side in history, the last will and testament of the Gospel according to Richard, George, Paul, and John. </TEXT>

<TITLE> 5 songs I think you should hear </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Thought I'd try this. If you guys like it, maybe I'll make it a series.    
  
Here's five songs that kind of vibe together, that I thought you all might enjoy. Note that four of them are unreleased, I gravitate to the rawness that comes with such recordings.    
The theme here is.. **dreaming through**  
  
[Flaming Groovies - Around the Corner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_QkxIgnwxw)  
-my god this song is fun, and you could tell me it came out yesterday, I'd believe you. Instead it's from 1969. Absolutely delicious.   
  
[Dylan and the Band - All I Have to Do Is Dream](https://vimeo.com/158720985)  
-Little outtake from the basement tapes, I was only able to find it on Vimeo. It's a sweet little rolling rocker, nice guitar back up, clumsy but fun solo, padded thumping background drums.  
  
[Jeff Buckley - Just Like a Woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh-PMHmd00o)  
-This cover is so awesome. From some unreleased (until a few weeks ago) demos he did in '93. His voice, of course, is like the Archangel Gabriel, but he does some really neat subtle little guitar moves that I find damn awesome.  
  
[Big Star - Like St. Joan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA7RaICr5XI)  
-This demo is just so mesmerizing.. I'll let this one do the talking.  
  
[Pink Floyd - Green is the Colour (live BBC)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XeWngFZaa8)  
-This doesn't even sound live, it's such a good recording. I'm not much a Floydian, but this one is just a dream. 
   
Here are the above songs [in a Spotify Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/1236835890/playlist/0z2GaWcQGOUNOjUnKil9KI)--
  
Thanks!   
(and for more curated quality, [here's my renowned spotify playlist](https://play.spotify.com/user/1236835890/playlist/1tQ2pv2vOvydj3YmRJ7pqB)  full of the most lovely of tunes of all genres) </TEXT>

I don't give a shit what they call themselves, the alt-right? that name is just fine. The devil wears many masks. I encourage everyone to fight them. That includes The_Donald folks, don't just try to disassociate yourself from these enemies of freedom, you have to speak against them as well. Honestly, if you choose not to do this, it will come back to haunt you, as you will be more and more tightly associated with them.

<TITLE> The New York Times caused severe damage to the Alt-Right and /r/The_Donald today, I salute them for their work </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-23 07:32:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> They brought the [alt-right](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/22/alt-right-supporters-donald-trump-backlash-disavow-reddit-4chan?CMP=share_btn_link) to Donald's face, and he denied them. They are cowering.  
  
They ran [an expos](http://nyti.ms/2f0L9G9)
on the human damage an effort by /r/The_Donald and /r/pizzagate to invent fake news has caused. This exposure resulted, directly, in /r/pizzagate getting shut down this afternoon. Right now at /r/The_Donald they are losing their minds, claiming /r/spez is a pedophile defending them, or bought. Their mods are giving them places offsite where they can carry on their sinister plottings, and telling their users to keep quiet for awhile, as they are under heavy scrutiny. Predictably, this has resulted in some of them saying their mods are in on it. Take a look over there, their rabidness is on full display. It's funny, they sent the NYT a ton of salt this week (to say they are "salty" for how Donald won) and look at them now. It is likely that the NYT will face more attacks from them, what form this will take, I cannot guess.  
  
So today The New York Times exposed two realms of evil, and gave them great injuries, only by asking people question. That is the power of focused, inquisitive journalism. 
  
I encourage, as I have before here, users to suppor The NYT and to message admin requesting /r/The_Donald be shut down.  
  
Today good took a small step on evil. Kudos, also, to any and all of you fighting these outlets of evil.

<TEXT> Alright, I'll stop griping sorry. I don't think "accomplish" is the word to use, or the goal. For one, it was a cathartic release of pain at the prospect of spending four years under someone who has directly threatened groups of people (muslims, mexicans) who will be under his reign. It's anguish that the years of Barack will be followed by years with the lord of chaos. This will be broadcast nationally and so the nation, maybe the world, will know that the same town that stopped a Trump event also did not take his election kindly, or lying down, and got up and release rage about its prospect. It will let people across the country know that we feel their pain, and expressed it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Erdogan is very powerful post-coup. Even assuming it wasn't setup, he used it to his advantage perfectly. The Kurds are a minority, exaggerated as a threat (like the US has been post-coup) to create an enemy for the Turkish people to bolster Erdogan and his party. He didn't invade Syria to stop ISIS in response to the airport attack, he did it to block the Kurds from getting close to the Kurds in Turkey. He wants to meddle in Mosul for this purpose too (Iraqi government is pissed about this) but so far he's been held on this by the US. He is making messes messier all for his own gain. It's a sad state of affairs for the Kurds and Turks who see through this alike, and for the state of mideast affairs in general. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's my belief. It's time to give up. It's to *let Assad win*. Because he won. It's over. The rebels lost. Let Russia win this won, don't go full blown cold war unending proxy war. Tens of thousands more will die if not. I know this is sad to let a dictator and mass murderer win, but what can you do? If you don't let the mass murderer win, tens of thousands more die, and thousands more migrants steam into Europe, Canada, US, etc.
  
So what do you do now? Bring the rebels to the table for surrender, make sure they are secured their safety. Once that is completed target ISIS completely, get ISIS done.
  
My main concern is that because the battle map is so overlapping, sooner or later, US or Russia is going to blow up one of the other's jets and then god only knows what we're in for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, getting as much done as he did with the obstruction makes him effective.  
   
Not to mention the root of that obstruction: total racism. That's all it was. Obama never lost his cool because he knew that's what they wanted, just one slip up where they could say: "see." He never did it, despite all the most horrid barely masked racism he dealt with. He is far too savvy to not know that's all it was. And why was it? To drum up support. If the Republicans looked obstructive or bullying to a black guy, it plays to their base. It's one thing to defy another party, but to stick it to a black guy, well, that's just dandy cotton candy to some folks. Even Donald Trump got in the game.  
  
Barack got it done. He did it under racist pressure. He did it while being a great father, while being a funny dude, while being a role model. He did it with thoughtfulness. He did it without one *major* screw up, no affair, no 4 trillion dollar wars. He did one hell of a job considering he was doing the hardest job their is, and I'm glad people are coming around to see how nice of a legacy he's leaving behind. He's wrapping up a pretty decent package to hand off to whoever is next.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the whole "Trump planned to bomb this" or "didn't really want to be president" thing to be doing him a favor. He's not that smart. He's f'ing this up in ways that indicate personal hubris and inability to know how the political game works, not deliberate misstepping. He wanted this, but he didn't realize what he signed up for, didn't realize he had to pivot and he totally could have (if he had this would be a totally different show right now). This is not deliberate, though he may even try to spin it like that himself to save face. This is just colossal ineptitude at playing the game. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-07-13 15:22:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is why reddit is not TV execs... We can do better than this.  
In fact, let me try.....  
A series set in ancient Greece where the gods are real and intertwined with the affairs of man. All the legendary heroes (i.e. Hercules, Odysessus, Achilles, are all real, the gods i.e. Apollo, Zeus, and Gaia, Hades, The Titans, and the real people like Plato, Homer, The Oracle, and so on. All of them, and at the same time despite historicity. There are soooo many baller stories out of that realm, and I picture it like one of my favorite animations... [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_EDBM1tOEo) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKfAF4jVqnA). Imagine a series done with that kind of beauty. You could also have the threats of war from outside the realm. Anyway, that's my idea. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As OP said, quite well, they're a "me-first" culture.. they feel a desperate need to flash and project power, to control lives, to control people, but at base root, they are so unbelievably insecure. Projects of power are the bells and whistles of a coward state (for example, North Korea's rocket tests).  
  
What is China insecure of? Truth and freedom. They're afraid of their people getting /woke and realizing the extent of the control apparatus. They're afraid of ["I"](http://i.imgur.com/JKCoz.jpg).  
  
How does the apparatus fail? Well, as soon as they are no longer able to keep up the story of infinite progress and lifting up all Chinese (and keeping up these narrative with absolutely sickeningly destructive effect on the environment), once the leaks in the apparatus of hiding insecurity... once that happens the collapse will come so fucking fast it will astound.  
  
edit: I already spotted [one suspicious account](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4sg39i/the_hague_rejects_chinas_sovereignty_claims_in/d592mjx?context=3 st=iqjfpt59 sh=f6386d5e), you can be sure they're here, controlling message here.

I have enjoyed the memes.. but I don't know if this game will make it through the week with this level of popularity. If you could battle friends and strangers.. that's where things would get very interesting. I wonder if the problem is the fighting strangers thing, presumably you would be able to if you could find friends in near field.. because that could get into a really grey area socially speaking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's because... for white people they *don't* want it to be true. They don't think it can be true, they don't want a world where they are in positions of power shooting down a race of people, they don't want to be the face of this, or face the reality of this, so they deny. Because the reality is, it hurts white people too, to be the face of hegemonic systematic execution of a race.... that don't feel good, that has consequences-- so the only way they can make it seem *not true* is by trying to find some kind of excuse that a cop would do that, the only way to do that is by putting blame on the victim. I'm not saying this is right, I'm saying that is the reason you're seeing all this denial and blame shifting.  
  
please note: this has brought some weird comments.. so.. this isn't blaming white people.. I'm explaining why, naturally, they would wish to seek any avenue of plausible deniability. Nor am I saying *all* white people ffs. If you are arguing against with those points, you're missing the point completely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> His winning despite being who he is is incredible. I don't mean that negatively, it's honestly fascatinating that he's pulling his level of shit-slinging, and still appealing. I at least admire the man's energy, he'll do three speeches in a day and he's fucking 70. That kind of energy is honestly incredible. Anyway, we're in for an interesting one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The fact is Trump would send us down a path that we can't even comprehend. To elect him would be a great shame upon so many who have *actually* tried to make this country great. It wouldn't be steps backwards, it would be going off the path completely. He has a certain appeal, and those who are hearing him have very serious grievances, but unfortunately even those to whom he is appealing, he will damage if president. The man doesn't love America, the man hasn't been good to America, his ego is a blackhole that sucks up everything in its path and knows no satisfaction. To vote for him, would be to vote for ego in its most pure form. To vote for him is to not vote for America's best interests, but for one man's best interests.  </TEXT>

But he hasn't got a record of leadership that I've seen people point to, nor does he have a coalition of friendships. Also he hasn't had much foreign policy involvement at all so it would make sense that his name would be absent from the world. I don't think most of America had heard of him before the election. Again, not being mean, just what I see. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting breakdown, good points. Something I want to bring up... his whole "going after the Clintons" speech next week I see as a continuation of bad direction. This base level mudslinging that worked against a bunch of doofuses that was the Republican field... but there's a lot of people who have heard garbage against the Clintons for so long it just is old hat at this point. Hillary is a nimble navigator and has been dodging mud her whole life.. and it's not like he'll have any new information? Why go there? A lot of people just don't even want to go there, it's old, over, buried.  
  
So the thing is this little speech is designed to be his response to getting BTFO by the foreign policy speech, one that demonstrated experience. This will just look entirely unequal to that effort. There is no way this will hurt Hillary, or make him look good. I wonder if he'll just drop it. He could do a speech on a million things, a focused message speech. If he were to do a series of speeches where he dropped cohesive plans... *that* is how he could engender interest. Not TMZ trash talking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Correct. It reeks of hypocrisy, as their leader Xi Jingping has taken on a *massive* corruption campaign, specifically where finances and priveliege of office is concerned. Around [100,000 low to mid-level officials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-corruption_campaign_in_China) have been charged, and graft chasers tracked down [330,000 people](http://www.economist.com/news/china/21695923-his-exercise-power-home-xi-jinping-often-ruthless-there-are-limits-his) *last year*. So that people at the very top are going without paying their taxes is an astounding lapse in Xi's cult of authority. The censors are having a field day with this one in China right this minute. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Freddie his goddamn self said of his legacy... "Do what you want with my music," he said, "but don't make me boring."  
  
Sacha is a once in a lifetime contender for this role. No one will ever be able to do it better but somehow Queen, who know, can't understand that Freddie was much more than even on on-stage God, he was a very, very complicated person, and also, [he loved cats](https://queenphotos.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/freddie-with-cat-1985-1986.jpg). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was a sub for two 1/2 years. Thanks for feeling. I was really popular with the kids cause I just hungout and made jokes but it was torture...It wasn't the kids so much as this nomadic life... never being in the same class twice, never seeing the same students, making absolutely no connections... it was such a waste of life, you can't even imagine fam-- to be such a no one. To exemplify, I don't have a single Linkedin or Facebook friend from that time. I was literally a ghost.  
  
I'd go home everyday after 8 hours of doing nothing, and write up resumes and cover letters that no one would read. Then repeat. Drive an hour there and back contemplating the worth of the mortal coil. Dreaming of a horizon of hope. Nothing ever happened. Repeat, repeat, repeat.     
  
It was so damn depressing, brutal, and seemed it would never end, but I never gave up hope and everyday I'm inching closer to my dream. I'm so close now.. I been waiting for my dream to come for *7 years*, and i *still* believe it will.
  
edit: somehow through synchronicity just a few minutes ago I got an email confirming I'm just about there-- anyone else who's wondering if they should give up a hope-- don't you damn dare. 7 years didn't stop me, how long would stop you? thanks all you supporting that means a whole ton, for real </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jesus spoilers? Well okay... He did some sweet miracles, preached some real good things about being a worthwhile human-- the Pharisees were not down to fuck around, perhaps because he was saying he was the son of man, and also he was preaching his own way, pretty ballsy no matter how you game; so they wanted him sliced out. They got a rat man Judas (it was an inside job)-- Judas told the Pharisees where was at just trying to digest his meal, just digeting a meal, havin a chat with his old dad in the park. His dad is all on him about his earthly duty he's got.. Jesus was hesitating, didn't matter. Judas and a squad of roman soldier boys show up on scene, take Jesus away. Judas is like... fuck what i done. They jail him, and give him a mock trial. Basically Pontious Pilate, the roman ruler of the area (Jerusalem was under Roman rule at the time), took him out front with this criminal Barabbas and asked the crowd who the wanted to live. Barabbas was well known in J-slam, so they picked him. This let Pilate feel like he wasn't guilty.  
  
Next day or so they make our man J carry a big old cross through the town. Not only are we gonna get you dead, we're gonna show you shame supreme along the way. He's whipped, given a crown of thorns. And they make him pull himself all the way to Golgotha, a rocky outcrop outside town, and at the top of this rock, with only his mom, his main gf, and the only brother of his squad still with him, referred to only as "the disciple Jesus love" (hm?).  
  
The clock strikes 3, our man J kicks it, asking up to the heavens "Father why have you forsaken me?" A line I always found very intriguing.  
  
3 days later, his girl Mary Mags, goes to visit him to polish off his body with sacrificial oils, and finds the rock that was covering his tomb moved. One would suspect that perhaps the Pharisees stole the body so he didn't go on to become a martyr whose religion would dominate the world for centuries, but on her way back to tell the others, she sees him... him... standing there. He looks different, but there he is.  
  
A little later Thomas (doubting thomas) is strolling outskirts of town, when there he is. Thomas is like no way J, I saw you get it. J is like, feel this. He has Thomas stick his hand into his exposed gooey wound. Thomas is like, yeah that's real. He goes and tells the other. A little later Jesus appears to them all. Never really hanging out like before, more like an Obi-Wan/half ethereal phase. And then a few weeks later, one last visitation and he's like cool I think I want to go home, I'm out. He flies up into the sky. Next thing the squad gets a visit from the holy spirit which allows them to go speak to all the people and spread J's word around earth. And so it trickled all the way around to here, where I'm telling it to you right now. </TEXT>

All I can do, is those escapes, and every single I wish hope and pray for more. For me, that would, in a dream, be to host travel shows.

<TEXT> I think what we may be seeing the initial moments of, is that specifically in Germany but I think it's a larger trend, the desire to root out cultural insensitivities, of being *told* to accept peoples or ideas without question, because it is  "right." These kinds of efforts to stymie so-called hate speech will in fact engender those very same sentiments. People and certain groups will begin to feel too much that they are being told what to believe. If this feeling grows enough, it could create a very dangerous situation; a self-perpetuating situation where, say, you are told you are racist but you feel like that is a simplification of how you feel, if not outright wrong, you will feel *even* more so feeling of being misunderstood, and alienated, by the very culture from which you come, for the sake a culture which is not your own.  
  
We all can imagine how those feelings could coalesce, so how almost bizarrely fitting that this experiment in mass exodus is being conducted in Germany. A place where the series of escalating tensions I just described above, could explode out of hand. I do not envy this problem Germany has brought upon itself, but I am fascinated with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Want to see a raw, cold blooded killer version of Inspector, where he's still got all his high-tech hi-jinks, but the killers are real. The mystery this time is a triple homicide on the south-east side. The bodies are stacked one on top of the other. They're mutaliated in such a way that they seem experimented on, with pieces of electronics coming out of them.... as if someone were trying to improve upon them... these bodies keep coming until one day they stop... because whoever created them figured out the recipe: and now there's an army of mean-ass robots with wings, and guns as hands, and they go on a rampage.. on the south east side. The Inspector is sipping on tea when one flies past the window. A stray bullet zips through the glass and explodes his tea cup. "We'll isn't that a thing." He grabs his coat, walks to the balcony flies off into a mid-air tackle of one of the flying killers. 
  
We find out Dr. Claw killed The Inspectors entire family, but Penny cold hacked him so he would forget (until reminded) and he never recalls his true motivation for chasing after Claw, until one day a Proustian madeleine reminds him of what happen and he goes through tramatic recollection of being there and being made to watch his family die. He asks Penny why she made him forget, and she says, because she wishes she could (Claw killed her family too).  
  
Can he avenge all this murder? Will he ask Penny to wipe his memory again? Will he get to the bottom of this one? Or will it get to the bottom of him.. </TEXT>

I mean, if he kills Han Solo as is much supposed, can that really be forgiven? Would Finn trust him after he lops his arm off (again as is supposed)? Plus he most certainly kills a few others I'm assuming. Is this all forgivable? Can he truly turn and be an acceptable hero? I would *love* to see him go against the other Rens at some point though. Oh man, I am foaming at the mouth imagining that (which which would surely happen if he turned). The other solution to a ton of redemption, is for a last minute redemption, a la Vader.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I find interesting, is that it is implied that *all* of the knights take part in it. I think when the picture of the squad in the rain came out we thought only Kylo was Force sensitive because he was the only one with a lightsaber. To me this info would imply otherwise though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Their weapon is fear. It is the base root of all their attacks-- to create fear, vulnerability, and divide the people. That is why they try to strike us at our most together, our most normal. They want to kill the lives of goodness we've created-- and indeed perhaps we've taken our stability and our culture for granted, not knowing how great and peaceful a world we've created.  
  
That's why this, this reopening, is exactly our weapon against the weapon of fear. I encourage anyone living in Paris to go to as many shows at the Bataclan as possible. Many comments here in this thread will be voices of fear, because fear is natural, but courage must be found. Go to the Bataclan. Go to Champs-lyses. Sacre Couer. Allez partout. You are still free, they have stolen nothing. Go, allez. Then you will be the soldier against their weapon fear, and there is only one weapon you need: to continue.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nazi comparisons diminish critique. Bless Germany for rebuilding, and rebranding after being the worst scourge in the history of man. However, for the love of fuck, you don't need to apologize anymore. That wrong can never be righted. I think Merkel saw an opportunity to do good, and wanted to-- but the *open invitation* to the migrants was absolute unnecessary insanity. They are risking the stability of the EU and their validity as its de facto leader with these actions (and acting like any dissent is absurd). The rest of the EU needs to ball up and say enough. Go Poland for getting the ball rolling. </TEXT>

I went to Paris/Barcelona last year, leaving the country for the first time and I went to the West Coast earlier this year, so thought a trip East would be great-- get both sides of the story. I had the benefit of friends in New York, and a friend who was a ranger in Acadia this summer. This was also my first time with a traveling companion, previously I've only gone solo and made my own way. I'm not sure where to next... was thinking taking a little drive around Italy might be nice....

<TITLE> I've put together a fifty hour Spotify playlist of nothing but pure beautiful music, spanning all genres, with deep cuts and prime cuts alike </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-09 12:26:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Click here to get to the webplayer version](https://play.spotify.com/user/1236835890/playlist/1tQ2pv2vOvydj3YmRJ7pqB)  

[For those without Spotify here is a doc with the tracklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uqe9HAlUFiFwPG5ZwvpGR5211krCLirmyVSx9Sa45EE)
  
To find it in the app, search "wicks" or my name "Brennan McDowell"  
  
/u/MentalSewage was cool enough to recreate the list in [Google Music linked here](https://play.google.com/music/playlist/AMaBXyn-ij88eTAPIjm2_9lJ1X7_GjDHCeM14_cm1HBBt5l52_U8mfdX7r9wS5qgA-taYQsXcU_aD8Pnv7qDHvMW4dLc71GaqQ==)  
  
/u/akx somehow scripted out [the songs to matching YouTube videos](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1094010/Reddit/wicks.html)  
  
/u/k1nkyk0ng made it into a [Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLknuiOt8_GfYGqnvvYV4lMQ7BDTC_eTfd)

/u/meomix made a Streamus version of it, his chrome extension that lets you use youtube like a playlist [here for the link](https://share.streamus.com/playlist/2603b7b2312f/fifty_hours_of_beautiful_music)
  
I posted this about a year ago, but I've since retooled it greatly. My goal is to cover every genre, as long as a song make one move. I really feel that people who pocket themselves into one genre are missing how much all comes from the same notes, and anything can move you.
  
Would love to hear recommendations, playlist recs, or playlist discussion too--  
  
Thanks and happy Friday!
