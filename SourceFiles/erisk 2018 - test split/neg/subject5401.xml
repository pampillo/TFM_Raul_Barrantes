<TEXT>  Requiring evidence for racism is not ignorant.

The fact you even said this when the racism is so blatant proves your willfull ignorance...

 That's actually not true - at least not for this year. So far, 134 white people have been shot by the police. Nine of them were unarmed. 79 black people have been shot so far this year. Six of them were unarmed. That's 6.7% of unarmed white people shot; 7.6% of unarmed black people shot. That's less than a percentage point difference. It's hardly cause for cries of racism.

i said shot and KILLED bro...show me those stats, none of these whites are getting killed white supremacists protect there own kind and show me a white unarmed 12 year child that was shot please...at least not this year? look at your logic that makes the last decade ok?

 BLM exists because, apparently, the black community identifies themselves by black first and an individual second. 

proving your ignorance yet again...BLM started after the murder of trayvon martin absolutely NOTHING to do with black first individual second...only white supremacists have that mind set, BLM campaigns against violence and perceived systemic racism toward black people nothing to do with your ignorant comment

The white supremacists community, apparently, identifies themselves as WHITE first every other color second. FTFY


In other words, if a white person is shot by a cop, who cares? He probably did something he shouldn't have been doing.

said no one ever.....

 I actually don't know that. Plenty of white people are shot by cops every year. In fact, MORE white people are shot by cops than black people

yes you do know that now your just playing stupid even your momma will tell you that...in fact, MORE unarmed black people are shot AND killed by cops...why do you think BLM exists? is there a WLM group doing protests for these white people getting shot?it must be real low key </TEXT>

<TEXT>  This was all within a few seconds. You do realize that, right?

how many times did i say he was blasted within seconds? regardless the fact that tamir was black is why they reacted they way they did...if he was a white 12 year old the scenerio would have been COMPLETELY different and you know it....and once more the cop got out of the car whilst he had his shirt lifted...passed the point of pulling out...you have to reach for your waist when you go into your pocket to get things like you know your ID? keys? felando castiel reached for his wallet and got executed in front of his wife and child, he could of gone to scratch his ass and he still would have been blasted...tamir rice was the wrong color in the wrong place...plain and simple

<TEXT> you need to stop puttin words in peoples mouth lil boy...never said i didnt like them...at all...just the single fantasy one is better than all historical ones combined...so your the president for every historical fan out there??? not all of them sound like you 90% are whiny cry babies....since the fantasy aspect of total war is pretty new id would not mind waiting while for the next fantasy title especially since total war has many factions and races involved and a fantasy aspect would have to considered very carefully so it would still be total war...that is why warhammer and total war are a match made in heaven...so no i would not dissapointed in waiting for a propper fantasy installment since WH would easily keep my occupied untill then...like the historical titles did the last few years...fantasy shit is HOT the interest for this will only grow...you know why i sound like a 10 year old??? CUZ TOTAL WAR WAR HAMMER II GOT ANNOUNCED!!! speaks voulmes when you try to check someone on grammar on reddit as a comeback lmao....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIXOOwthtaE this is how we see you guys </TEXT>

<TEXT> Directly from the manifesto ripped from his computer...if hes not racist Donald Trump is a real stand up Fellow!!!

Blacks

I think it is is fitting to start off with the group I have the most real life experience with, and the group that is the biggest problem for Americans.

N*****S are stupid and violent. At the same time they have the capacity to be very slick. Black people view everything through a racial lense. Thats what racial awareness is, its viewing everything that happens through a racial lense. They are always thinking about the fact that they are black. This is part of the reason they get offended so easily, and think that some thing are intended to be racist towards them, even when a White person wouldnt be thinking about race. The other reason is the Jewish agitation of the black 
race.


I wish with a passion that n*****s were treated terribly throughout history by Whites, that every White person had an ancestor who owned slaves, that segregation was an evil an oppressive institution, and so on. Because if it was all it true, it would make it so much easier for me to accept our current situation. But it isnt true. None of it is. We are told to accept what is happening to us because of ancestors wrong doing, but it is all based on historical lies, exaggerations and myths. I have tried endlessly to think of reasons we deserve this, and I have only came back more irritated because there are no reasons. </TEXT>
