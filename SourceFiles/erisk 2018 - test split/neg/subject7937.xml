<TEXT> /r/BuyItForLife took this down because you can't buy it but suggested this sub would be a better home for it.

Back in 2005 I visited Vietnam and forgot to bring sandals so I had to go buy a pair, being raised in America my stature is a bit different than those who are native so it was impossible to find sandals that will fit my US size 12.5 - I had to find a shoemaker to make them custom. We found this tiny little shanty of a store that said they make custom footware and this guy hobbled together (from scraps) this pair of sandles, he even threw a Puma charm on it (lol) and about 30min later and $10-USD, I had a pair of sandals.

My fiance absolutely hates how they look but they are the best sandals I've ever had! I've worn them on boats; taken them into the ocean for extended periods of time; I wore them in the Florida muds fishing for conch and even lost a sandal (for a while); I've dragged them through every terrain imaginable; they've endured the abuse of being left outside in the winters of Colorado; they've baked in the sun for days on end in the summer sun; slipped off my foot and run over numerous times; but I've never once done anything to maintain them. They're practically as good as new despite all this abuse except for some wear on the bottom.

It's unfortunate that I'll probably never able to buy another pair, I have no idea what they're made of but I'm glad I have these. At the rate they're holding up, I'll probably be well into retirement age before they're no longer functional.

I know they're not the best looking but they have freaking seen some shit yet they champion on like they were just made. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started using NOIP recently and I installed the client at first but then realized that my Nighthawk8500 had DDNS NOIP built-in. I then uninstalled the client and put my credentials in Netgear's UI, seemed to work fine for a while until I turned on PIA and NOIP switched the IP to the one PIA provided me.  PIA vpn runs as a client on the desktop not the router so I have no idea why or even how NOIP even knows, if NOIP runs strictly on the built-in DDNS on my router how the heck would it know if the desktop's VPN service is running?

Now I have to constantly check the router and make sure that my NOIP account has the right IP, is there some way to fix this? Any insight would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Z77, i5, 980Ti, Dell U2711 connected via displayPort.

After the Win10 Creator's update I lost the ability to put the monitor to sleep nor do I have a screensaver. I'm on a normal Desktop PC, should I have not forced the Creator's Update? Is there a Creator's update that is specific to standard desktops?

I've clean-installed the Nvidia driver multiple times, reinstalled chipset drivers from Asus. Checked advanced power settings over and over again, checked for multi-monitors, checked for multi display drivers, checked for any 3rd-party drivers, nothing but Nvidia drivers. I've posted to [tom's hardware](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/id-3386311/monitor-longer-sleeps-win10creator-update-monitor-displays-black-cursor-screen.html), [mircrosoft community](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/updated-to-the-creators-update-and-now-my-monitor/aa25babc-41f6-4c6a-91e0-f8413688a9f6).

Windows boot and performance is fine except for one issue: when Windows puts my monitor "to sleep" - instead of turning off the monitor, Windows just puts up a black screen with the cursor displayed. This leaves my monitor completely ON with a mouse cursor instead of powering OFF the monitor like it used to do; I have to manually turn off the monitor to save energy and avoid any burn-in.

I get no errors or anything, the monitor will not turn off - it just displays black with a mouse cursor and then goes back to working order when I "wake" via mouse movement or keystroke.

I'm very convinced that Windows somehow believes my device is something other than a desktop computer. I've seen an option where you can revert back to a previous build of windows10 during my searches but for some reason I don't have that option in my recovery.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated, thanks ahead!

I've posted a few screenshots in the [microsoft community forum](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/updated-to-the-creators-update-and-now-my-monitor/aa25babc-41f6-4c6a-91e0-f8413688a9f6). </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know western wedding receptions are pretty small most of the time but unfortunately that's not case with traditional Asian ones. Our reception will be 450-500 guests (average for Asian receptions), which means 45-50 tables, which means 45-50 centerpieces.

I'm having a hell of a time trying to stay cost-effective and stay under budget. I've been in contact with a dozen vendors on alibaba and they're all no-go, material cost is really competitive but freight is ridiculous. 

Anyone have any tips on where to go to get like bulk vases or things of the sort? We're looking for something that has a smaller footprint but stands relatively tall. Any input would be greatly appreciated! 

Bonus, any suggestions on party favors would be great too!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I worked every position imaginable at my parent's restaurant for decades, unpaid except when filling in as waitstaff - I got to keep tips.

Anyhow, this woman comes in with her three young kids for dinner - we were moderately busy and, like in most cases, I was the only one waiting tables. Juggling about six tables simultaneously, her overly obnoxious, extremely misbehaving kids were stirring up a storm of messiness and screaming. It's a small restaurant, you could hear them from the kitchen. She called me over for something every five-minutes so that she can ask for things like refills (when their cups were clearly full, she'd call me over and chug her water while I watched), extra sides, sauces to-go, things that weren't very common at all; I accommodated all of her requests with with the utmost professionalism and grace while her kids threw their food all over the place. After about 40min into the meal, her boyfriend joins her for dinner.

I assume this is her boyfriend because the kids don't call him dad or anything like that and he doesn't seem to have any authority over them nor does he care that they're wreaking havoc to booth while disturbing every other table in the restaurant. I give him a menu, he then starts giving me a hard-time about how there isn't any Chinese food he recognizes (even though he's in a Vietnamese restaurant), takes a good ten minutes of "customer service" guidance until he figures out what he wants.

Whilst he's eating the meal and the mess his girlfriend's kids grows larger and larger I hear him mumble "this is some bullshit Chinese food" while he woofs down the food contributing to the mess. It must have struck a chord because he proceeds to make a take-out order.
I'm going to digress here for a second, being short-staffed at the restaurant makes you wear ALL of the hats, so all facets outside of cooking the food is handled by me that night.

I pack their to-go order and he decides to cancel half of it, I'm fine with that, whatever they want, right? They also ask me to pack what's left of their food to-go as well, there wasn't much left of anything (most of it is on the wall, floor, and table but I pack what I can anyways). The bill comes out to be around $75, this couple and the three kids did rack up quite a bit - note that I did not charge them for any extras or anything like that and clearly took off the cancelled order.
The woman pays the check in cash with a Benjamin, I give her change with plenty of singles and fives. They hang out for a bit, it's now been two-and-half-hours and the kids have been mashing the food deeper into the carpet, stained the table cloths and used the wall as a finger-paint canvas, all the while the restaurant gets busier and busier.

While I'm busy with other tables they up and vanish in a matter of seconds, I go to clean up and collect the tip: forty-two cents, the coin-change I gave back to her, I thought: this can't be right - I looked around the booth, under the table, nothing but food mashed everywhere.
At this point I've basically had it with this table. In the corner of my eye I can still see the woman trying to get her kids in the van so I grab the 42cents and run out to her and say "excuse me ma'am, I think you forgot this". She replies, "no, you earned that" - I then gave the change to the one of her kids saying "I think your mama needs this more than I do, can you keep it for her?". There wasn't even the slightest glimpse of embarrassment in the woman's face. I walk back inside and have to leave the Jackson Pollock of a booth while I tend to the rest of the customers during peak hours, after the dinner rush was over it took me nearly 45min to clean up their booth, it was an eye-sore for nearly two hours, I'm sure patrons were pretty put off by it even though I tried my hardest to minimize the disaster when I had time between serving other guests.


tldr: customer comes in with kids, is rude, loud, racist, wrecks booth, and is a disturbance for over 2hrs, leaves 42-cent tip on a $75 check with zero remorse. </TEXT>

Once it finally starts and passes that tiny hurdle at the beginning it runs fine, idles fine, no check engine codes or anything.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> 2001 Acura TL intermittent start problems depending on how long it's been off... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-10 01:04:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've been dealing this for the last year and cannot figure out for the life of me what's going on. It's a 2001 Acura TL automatic. 

Always cranks, starts intermettent.

I've noticed that the car has some issues starting if the engine is off for roughly 40min-1hr, now I say this because if I let it sit for two hours or longer, there is no issue. 

Long drive sessions yield the same issue: let's say I drive the car for 35min and then stop to get gas or pop in the store for a few minutes it'll have trouble starting if I don't get back to it in the next half-hour. 

Lastly, multiple stops will do it too. If I'm driving for a while but make more than three stops, it'll decide that it doesn't want to start anymore.

If the car sits for a while, it cranks fine. It has no trouble starting overnight or after a full workday.

I did have a few codes saying that the TPS was malfunctioning so I replaced the entire throttlebody since the TPS is revited in. I've cleaned the manifold. I have no idea what the heck is going on, any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance for any input.

Edit: 03-21-17, I've installed a new Fuel pump relay, it was a pain the ass - will report back findings in a week or so.

Edit: 03-22-17, switching out the main relay has not worked, I've been recording video of my start until I caught it. Today I drove roughly 55min and shut my car off, waiting about 20min and tried to start it and caught on video the car struggling, the car finally starts at about 1m19sec https://youtu.be/-omAVsAiwvE - you can see that once it does start the idle is really low and I'm trying to rev the engine (sorry for the angle, I was hoping I'd get audio of the engine because it sounds funny but watching the video now you can't really hear anything) - after some time I turn it off, start the car, and this time you'll notice that the idle is back to normal. Any thoughts? Suggestions? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I know having a 6pt and a 12pt is a bit excessive but the space taken is marginal but having standard and extended sockets is really quite helpful. Also, using a large wrench in tight spaces can be a pain so you've gotta have sockets that fit the smaller wrenches too - it's all situational really.  </TEXT>

Any opinions would be greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-01-26 22:12:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Currently I have a FireTV that runs Kodi with libraries pulled from the emby server. In Kodi I run a program called PseudoTVLive where I've setup channels according to activity. Say I just want background noise while I'm doing something else, I've got a channel that has about a dozen shows that don't require attention (ie the simpsons, archer, futurama, etc.) and PTL will randomly play an episode from the list of TV shows selected and will continue to do so consecutively. 

Is there a way to emulate this natively on emby alone? It'd be nice to be able to do something like this when I'm just connecting remotely to my server. </TEXT>

The only downside is the carbon fiber isn't tough enough to pop open a bottle cap, the only other blade I'd consider carrying is a carbon fiber paramilitary2 but I don't because it's just slightly more inconvenient to close one-handed. </TEXT>

<TITLE> So I want to start mining for fun on my workstation while I'm not at work - where do I start? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Completely new to this but I figured it'd be a fun learning process. 

So I've got a decent little workstation at work and I thought it'd be nice to take some baby-steps into BTC, let the machine mine or something while I'm not here. It's Win8, i5-3.5ghz, 32GB, GTX970. Should I try out hardware mining? Is it better to join a pool? I don't have enough space for HDD mining unless invest in some new disk space. 

I've got a wallet setup, searching around the web, seems like tutorials are pushing their own software that would help them out more than it'd help me, so where should I start? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have been trying since the last update to get this. I want tasker to flash messages from hangouts (ultimately 'say' them) but the new variables don't seem to work. It used to work pre-update.

I can get tasker to recognize the sender using %evtprm2 and I've figured out that %evtprm6 is the message (or I assume it is since %evtprm() will show 6 as msg) but if I use %evtprm6 it only shows as "msg" not the actual message. I've tried %evtprm1-9 and nothing has worked.

Searching for this only brings up old threads, thought someone here could help me out - thanks! </TEXT>

Is this safe to use though? Will the cracks go away though usage (hoping the seasoning would fill it in over time)? Or am I SOL and should start the CI all over? </TEXT>

<TITLE> looking for a (video) podcast app for android that supports custom importing and different playback speeds. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-07 21:08:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So on my LG G4 I've got PocketCasts for all of my audio content, I absolutely love the app but a large part of my podcast consumption are videos played on my iPad, in which I use iCatcher. 

PocketCasts doesn't really play well with importing your own files whether it be on iOS or android. My iPad is starting to get a little dated and I was thinking of moving away from iOS and getting an android tablet but I can't seem to find a good podcast app that will not only download video podcasts but will also let me import my own media and assign them to different custom podcasts. This is important because different podcasts play at different speeds. 

I import videos daily to my iPad and assign them to different playing speeds, iCatcher does this pretty fantastically but back-to-back playback has been really buggy for me since the last few iOS updates.

Anyone have any app suggestions that has this functionality? </TEXT>

same outside, my slightly cracked glass screen protector was still on the front except there was a piece of tape over the front; back had the same SN and IMEI. i tracked my shipping to their facilities and they sent my "repaired" phone the same day they got it. overall it took seven days, everything seems to be good.

<TEXT> the new firestick is just $5 more while the 1st gen is $10 less and the stick has a remote while Rpi3 would need MKB... seems like the firestick would be the way to go in this situation. 

Budget ideally would be about $35-$40

<TITLE> Looking for a cheap way to mix the audio on my iPad via bluetooth with the audio on my PC via 3.5mm to my bluetooth headphones. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-19 00:42:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> At work I have my iPad playing video podcasts all day long and i listen to it via cheap bluetooth headphones but there are times where I need to hear my computer's audio as well (mail notifications, inner-office chat notifications, watching randomly linked youtube videos etc.).

Right now I have a separate pair of wired headphones that go directly into the motherboard - I don't have speakers and I don't want speakers so I don't disturb anyone around me. 

My question is: is there a cheap mixer that will receive my iPad's audio via bluetooth and transmit it to my bluetooth headphones while mixing my desktop's audio? 

If there is one, will my bluetooth headphone's buttons still work?

Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

I don't want to spend a bunch of money on a car I'll only drive another year. I figured since I already had this interface I could kinda hack together a bluetooth solution - I've used three different FM transmitters but as I drive around the "empty frequencies" become live frequencies and there's a ridiculous amount of interference forcing me to always change the station.

Any other suggestions? </TEXT>

the original cable is an old 30pin Apple dock (alternatively, could I use a 30pin-to-3.5mm with a female-to-female coupler to connect to a bluetooth receiver's aux jack?) </TEXT>

<TEXT> there's really nothing to it, answered this a bunch of times in the comments:

I took three bearings, used "jb weld" to glue them together. I put the three bearings with the glue horizontally in a vice to make sure it sets straight. I bought two knurled Screws (Stainless 6-32x7/16) and Knurled Nuts (Brass 6/32), and sawed off the screw so that it'd sit flush with the nut when screwed in. You'll have to check and make sure the nuts and screws fit the bearings you bought. After it sets, screw in the nuts and you're good to go! </TEXT>

<TEXT> after putting the adhesive on it, i pressed it flat on the table and then flipped a vice upsidedown and pinched it with the vice horizontally making sure it's perfectly straight. i tightened it and dabbed a bit more to reinforce the bond. let it set about 2hrs and dabbed a bit more. the first one i made (shown in the gif) broke bonds when i dropped it really hard, [the pictures](http://imgur.com/a/jUvYy) i showed are after gluing it together again and then reinforced the sides. </TEXT>

<TEXT> for me it's just a small token that I fiddle with - much like how some people carry a coin, worry-stone, or random key-chain. 

The tops and spinning coins are absolute marvels of precision and material. I really admire the craftsmanship put into each one and having something unique that I can just fiddle with outside of playing with my phone is always great. 

The precision tops/coins these days are made with some pretty exotic materials (much like fancy knives) and they spin for a crazy amount of time. 

My coin is clocked at 20min, I have other tops that have similar spin times but they're not easy to carry as they're oddly shaped. There's just something tranquil watching something spin, almost float, for an extended amount of time.

/r/PocketTops is a pretty dead community here on reddit but the Poket Top Talk group on facebook is very active if you're looking for more info. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anyone know how I can create sustaining water droplets?

I bought water-beads for a shot, it came out great but now I need to make smaller ones that affix to a product. I've tried using various ratios of glycerin and water and sprayed it on the product but the beads aren't quite round enough.

Looking to basically demonstrate an extremely hydrophobic surface. My goal is to create a macro shot of water beading at a somewhat exaggerated level.

Any help would be awesome, thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Info:

I've got two hp laserjets that I manage - I print about 100-150 different documents a day. Each document has specific settings due to certain documents needing to pull from different trays using different media. Oh and the copy count of each document is different as well.

I'm looking for software that I can queue up jobs so I can run like a giant list of different files with different settings so I can walk away from the printer for a while. 

Currently I'm just using Acrobat Reader to print as it's the only program that reads Adobe Illustrator files correctly without actually having to open Illustrator.

Any advice is greatly appreciated, thank you ahead of time! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was really hoping that the steam link would basically stream steam so I could just do other things on my PC. Alas after a few minutes with the steam link and a quick search comfirming it's just an over-glorified interface that mirrors my display (which I already have the capability to do with my 50' HDMI cable), I'm severely disappointed.

I guess I'll just save it given the very off chance I want to play in the bedroom.

Does anyone know if the hardware is even capable to stream steam separately in a future software update? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is there an economically sound equivalent to "Hydro Flask" (like how "Ozark Trail" is to "YETI"/"RTIC"? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've had an RTIC tumbler for a while and recently ran into the walmart clone Ozark Trail that is nearly identical to the RTIC and YETI. Tumblers are great but it would awesome if there was a Hydro Flask clone that has the same build quality for half the price (or in terms of the YETI, a quarter of the price).

Edit: I recently discovered that MonoPrice has bottles that look identical - anyone have any experience with them? If they're exactly the same, I'd love to be able to buy a Hydroflask spout cap and pair it with the MonoPrice equivalent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dave, I just ordered a SlimFold Original SS (can't wait to get it in my hands!) - anyhow, I've got some sort of odd things that I currently carry in my wallet and I've been scouring the internet to find plastic sleeves that would fit into the SlimFold's slots. Everything I've found seems to be way too wide for the SlimFold's card slots, would you happen to know of any sleeves that would be a perfect fit for your wallet? I'm looking for [exactly this](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rOBdAKMyL._SL1000_.jpg) but with a narrow enough footprint to easily slide in and out of the SlimFold's card slots. I would not be using it for cards, more for like a spare key, band aids, thin pocket tools, etc.

On the same note, I would absolutely love some kind similar accessory that is folded or has a tab that can accommodate a photo to slide into a slot or two sort of turning the SlimFold into a faux L-wallet.

Since you're the designer/founder I thought I'd ask you direct - I can't be the only person looking for these types of inserts, right? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've had the router for about two months and it has been flawless. There was a power outage recently and even though the router was plugged into a UPS it somehow bricked the router. Solid amber power LED; hard reset does nothing, doesn't even flash the LEDs no matter how long I hold it.

I took a risk and got the router on ebay which turned out ok until the brick, I called netgear but the seller had already registered it under his name and is now unresponsive. Netgear won't RMA it because it's registered to someone else and I have no receipt for proof of purchase so now I'm out nearly $300 and no network!

What are my options now outside of dropping $350 on a replacement router?

Thanks in advance for any help! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-03-23 18:55:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I heavily rely on custom notification sounds so as I know when I really need to look at my phone, for months I thought I was having syncing issues with gmail and hangouts. Gmail would do like this batch notify and it'll try and play like 4 notification sounds at once and it wasn't like instant push. Then hangouts would only use stock notification sounds.

I don't know why I didn't think of it before but I eventually I figured out giving hangouts and gmail the right permissions all my notifications started working normally again. This may be due to the ROM I'm running defaults the least amount of permissions possible on stock apps but I'm just glad the issue is finally solved, just thought I'd post this in case anyone else has been having custom notification sound issues. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Updating multiple files with linked placed files all at once? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-11 22:21:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I work for a company that creates custom labels for many chemical products. In order to streamline various sizes that are requested I create what I call a "master label", with those master labels I then place those files in another document, scale for the appropiate dimentions, doubled up (sometimes tripled up) along with volume text (net weight/volume).

This file is then used by another computer to print via Acrobat.

Theoretically if I update the master file, the changes should ripple across any file that uses that link - which it does if you open the file in Illustrator on the computer it was originally created on. But if it's opened on a different computer using Acrobat it will display and print what the file looked like when it was last saved (not showing the changes that made in the master file).

My workaround for this is to open up all the files that uses the linked master file, select something, nudge it and nudge it back and then save. This then changes the 'last saved' and the file is now updated.

It has been an absolute chore to do this, each brand I work with has at a minimum of 40 different files that uses linked placement and if there's a small change like say a new phone number I have to change it on all the master files then open up all the files that references the linked files, nudge, nudge back, and save.

I work with over 2000 different brands so when there's a change, the simple task becomes a daunting nightmare.

So my initial question is: is there a way to update a bunch of files all at once ensuring that the linked files are refreshed and is displaying the latest save of the master file?

Also, have I approached this situation correctly in using the "placed linked" file or is there a much better, more efficient way of handling this?

EDIT: so I've come up with sort of a workaround. I ran into this script called [WR-SAVEcloseALL](http://illustrator.hilfdirselbst.ch/dokuwiki/en/skripte/javascript/wr-saveandcloseall) - I open up every document that think has been affected by changes and run the script, it saves the illustrator document and moves onto the next one until all open documents have been saved. It's not what I want to do ideally but it sure as hell beats opening up the doc, nudging an object and nudging it back and saving. Hope this helps someone.  </TEXT>

Although I've already downloaded from Sammobile and tried my damnedest to flash, sammobile doesn't have the latest firmware - my understanding is that once you 5.0 you cannot flash back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My little cousin said he went into SU and did "full unroot" and after the reboot got stuck on the AT T logo, the kid brought the phone to me in search of help.

I've tried every which way I could think of using odin to try and reflash everything under the sun and cannot find a solution. I can get into download and recovery fine but I cannot flash anything: odin flashes fail, recovery won't authenticate any roms.

stumbled [on this thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=60136403 postcount=46) and downloaded an official rom but flashing fails after authentication:

He said he was on 5.0, stock rooted stock rom - he told me he was sick and tired of the 5.1 update notification and tried to unroot to update and now it's soft-bricked.

here's a screen of all the firmwares and softwares and roms I've tried flashing every which way possible
http://i.imgur.com/NqZeQlL.png

I was thinking I could root again and then install custom recovery but can I even do that with no rom installed? any help would be much appreciated!

one more pic of boots for good measure:

<TEXT> My two ATVs are running OSMC exclusively with Kodi on them, one already has a Broadcom chipset and it used to run Crystalbuntu but I just recently "fresh started" it with OSMC due to some scraping issues.

So the new versions of Kodi don't support the Broadcom chipset? Did I just screw myself moving from Crystalbuntu to OSMC?

Wait, nevermind, OSMC supports BCHD and apparently there's nothing better than the BCM970015. </TEXT>

<TEXT> wow, controversial lol

if someone can "make a copy" of my key via photo, surely lock picking would be a part of their skill set and it'd be much less of a hassle to pick than go through the trouble of making a key. a 5-pin lock is pretty easily picked with just a little practice and a 6-pin with a little more. Say i did blur out the teeth, they can still see the type of key and grab a matching bump-key and skip the picking all together.

that said, this car [needs a chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transponder_car_key) to stay running so they can copy away, it doesn't make a difference. 

if someone's going to rob me or steal my car, a reference photo to my keys isn't going to make any difference because there are **much more practical ways** than duplicating keys from a photo on the internet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is it worth upgrading from my Airport Extreme to a proper router if I mostly use LAN?

I've got an 5thgen Apple Airport Extreme as my router with a Linksys SE1500 to expand my LAN. Nearly everything on my network is ethernet except obviously my phone and tablet. Will I gain ethernet performance if I upgrade to say ASUS RT-AC68U or a Netgear Nighthawk AC1900?

I'm guessing the new routers out there are all about wireless performance but is it worth upgrading if 90% of my connections are via LAN? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is there a product equivalent to the little stripe that's on cartridge razors? (I'm specifically fond of the stripe that's on Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor Blades). </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-19 22:24:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have no idea what the strip is and I know I don't like foams as I mostly shave short stubble and foam is overkill (and as I've been reading on this sub, canned foam isn't ideal). I basically shave stubble every other day and have never tried DE but I have a bunch of cartridges left that seem to stay pretty sharp but the stripe wares out extremely fast. Anything helps, thanks in advance! 

Edit: I shave on the go a lot and busting out a whole kit isn't really something I want to do (especially at an airport bathroom). In my personal experience, a wet face and a cartridge blade with a fresh strip has worked very well but since those strips maybe last for 4 or 5 shaves, I was looking for a product version of that strip. I'm very interested in getting a DE for home use but what about on the go?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I use:

* Non-dairy milk: almond, soy, cashew, coconut - sometimes they go alone, sometimes combined, in this case it was soy and cashew combined.
* Spinach
* Carrots
* Kale
* Avocados
* Raw Eggs
* Banana
* Raw Honey
* Green tea matcha powder (that's what the box is)
* Cucumber
* Berries (varies depending on season and availabilty) 

What you see there is divided into four batches which yields six large mason jars:
http://imgur.com/a/iozr7

So per batch I use about 2 teaspoons of matcha, just a little over a cup of milk, roughly two carrots, one and a quarter banana, half a cucumber, one egg (although sometimes i'll scramble and egg and divide that into four), half an avocado, 1 half bushel of kale, a quarter of the large bag of spinach, a large handful of berries, and the honey is added last to adjust for taste, it changes depending how sweet the berries and bananas are. Sometimes I'll squeeze half a lime in for some acidity but I often forget to buy that when I'm at kingstupids. 

This stuff gets really thick when I'm blending especially after you add the avocado so sometimes I'll have to add more milk or a little water to keep the from creating the dreaded smoothie bubble. I blend it like there's no tomorrow there are no visible particles, everything's raw and have it for lunch. This has been my lunch for about a year now. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I actually have all the missing fonts but they are named differently on the new workstation and there doesn't seem to be a way to rename the font so that Illustrator wouldn't find things missing. I figured I could write a script that will find and replace the fonts automatically (at least with about a dozen of the most common fonts).

So I'll open up a file:

then I'll have to find every missing font even though clearly I have them.

I literally have thousands of files I have to do this with and it's an absolute pain and kills production.

Absolutely any help with this would be fantastic! Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I'm doing is giving heavy strokes on text but since Illustrator doesn't allow you to stroke just the outside of a text object without outlining it, I have to duplicate the text and heavily stroke that.

So is there a workaround for this? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I got foreclosed on about 4 years ago, my mother co-signed and we both got hit with the foreclosure. She's getting roughly 100K and wants to put it in a house straight away, the house is 250K.

My questions:

Since she's putting down so much, does she even need a co-signer for the other 150K? 
 
If I co-sign for said 150K, will I be able yet again co-sign for a different loan say when my SO and I decide a house win about a year or so?

If not, how difficult would it be to then sign over everything completely over to my mom? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I design labels for a chemical company and there are standards that must be met when putting warnings on labels, there are different size requirements depending on the volume of the container. What I've done is create the warnings as a separate file and I would then place it as a linked file on the label but as I mentioned earlier, they need to be different sizes for different volumes.

The warning file is sized to the smallest volume, so when I place the warning on those labels, it's just a click (no resizing). Now, I want to have multiple artboards of the same warning but in a different size to use that *one-click* feature without having to resize it. I'm trying to streamline this process because I have over 7000 different labels I need to put warnings on and going in and resizing the label for every label that isn't the minimum volume would be absolutely dreadful.

If there was a way to have one artboard be the source while the other three arboards mirror that artboard I could one artboard to edit and it would then ripple across every label. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm looking for a way to make a master artboard and then have three other artboards that duplicate the master arboard but in different sizes. I do not want to place a linked file because I want to be able to use it as a template. Placing a linked file, everytime I save as a new file it references the old file and I have to relink to the new file that's been created.

Essentially I want to be able to use the "place linked file" but instead of *file* I want it to be an artboard within the document, is this possible? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is going to be an everyday jacket that will occasionally be used on the slopes in Colorado. Being how bi-polar our weather is the versatility is a huge factor. Trying not to break the bank, budget will probably be about $350.

To give a little style reference I'm liking North Face's Triclimate Vortex and their Mountain Light but from what I hear 3-in-1's (regardless of brand) use lesser quality material and there's much debate about North Face's brand anyhow. So I'm on a quest to find separate pieces what will zip together, this is sort of a big factor for me as I want to be able to throw the jacket on without having to "double put on".

I'm brand agnostic and open to any suggestions. Thanks! </TEXT>

I remember reading somewhere a while back that there's a company that sells giant screens like this for pretty cheap but can't remember who it was.

Mostly looking for my uncle. He's got this Mitsubishi DLP that has outlived its life, I've changed the bulb on it at least a dozen times and now the DLP mirrors have locked up putting white specs all over the projection. It's a 73" so he's wanting something comparable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I currently use the [pistol vac](http://amzn.com/B008LW73UY) and at first it was great, the setup vacuumed beautifully but now something that used to take 2min to vacuum now takes nearly 6-7min. The sealing valves seem to wear out pretty quickly on the bags (or maybe it's the gun?).

I prefer using the zip-top system over something like a foodsaver because I'm constantly accessing different foods and would rather not waste bags by constantly sealing things like bacon, cheese, avocado, etc.

Any suggestions out there or am I stuck with Waring? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow I never saw my profile in a light that suggests that I'd like to date only younger women; looking at it now I realize that I did have it set to 24-30 (I've changed to 26-32) - not sure how I came up with those numbers in the first place. The age really isn't an issue with me as long as her mindset is not significantly younger.

There's a whole weird history as to why all my friends are much younger than I am, long story short: I kind of just fell into a younger crowd making friends through family who're much younger than I am.

I'm very open to having kids as I feel it'd put a little more focus towards my life but that's just me.

Thank you for the critique! re-reading it with this new view, I'll take the advice about the last two paragraphs.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Anyone have any tips dealing with the disorientation associated with heavy prescriptions (-9) when switching back and fourth between contacts and glasses? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-05 01:09:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been near-sighted since the 3rd grade, started wearing gas permeable contacts in the 5th grade (I'm 30 now with soft contacts). I have a really hard time adjusting to wearing glasses after wearing contacts for an extended period; with my glasses everything is further away, there's a a fishbowl effect on objects that closer to me, and my overall balance feels similar to being tipsy. It takes me up to four days to adjust to the disorientation but the everything-looks-farther-away and fishbowl effect stays (as compared to my blurred vision or contacts).

I've experienced this issue with all the glasses I've ever had, I figure it's because of how bad my vision is but I would love to know if it's not. (My current pair is the SOUL from FATHEADZ)

Is there anything I can do to reduce the disorientation?

Any input would be great, Thanks!

Oh, btw I thought I should mention that I can adjust from glasses to contacts in a matter of hours. </TEXT>

<TEXT> there are two downsides so far: the tiny little screws that keep the battery door on (because I want to be able to change batteries on the fly), [easily remedied](http://instagram.com/p/rtB2GUB8x0/) with a drill and some [magnets](http://amzn.com/104800001X); and the worse one (new to me today) is that the built-in ohm reader bugs out and reads your coils lower than they actually are. I found that clicking 4-times and holding on the 4th click bypasses that, not sure if that's a real fix  because it just started happening today but so far it seems to do fine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I make the waffles with a plantain, an egg, almond milk, pecans, almonds, and a pinch of salt - throw all in a blender until silky smooth. After the waffle iron's done with the waffles I throw them in a pan on medium heat until they get a nice crisp crust (leaving the waffle in the iron longer just  seems to just steam the waffle and makes it dark soggy). 

I don't have any measurements as I just eyeball everything, sorry.

I used 6x uncured bacon strips (baked at 405f), organic local colorado tomato, four whole lettuce leaves and homemade olive oil mayo. 

For the dehydrated sweet-potato chips, i used a mandolin and threw the pieced in a dehydrator for about 4hrs, tossed in EVOO with some salt and baked at 300 until I felt they were done.  </TEXT>

my cat stops as soon as I make eye-contact with her and won't do it if I'm paying attention (I had to hide to get the video).

She's definitely not in any pain nor does she move away or show any negative reactions - of all the years she's never even so much as hissed. 

I've noticed one constant: she'll inevitably howl right after eating, then throughout the day regardless if she just ate or not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't remember where I found this but I make this every 2-3 weeks and snack on about a hand-full at a time when I'm really hungry and lazy. Outside of [homemade pork rinds](http://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/2bkpkd/pork_rinds_1cup_174cal_1002gfat_0carbs/), this is my favorite snack.

**Paleo Granola**

Ingredients

* 1 cup Almonds, roughly chopped

* 1 cup Pecans, roughly chopped
*  cup Cashews, roughly chopped
*  cup Unsweetened Coconut Flakes
*  cup Unsweetened Shredded Coconut
*  cup Hemp Hearts
* 2 tsp Vanilla Extract
*  tsp Sea Salt
* 1 tsp Cinnamon
*  cup Raw Honey

*Instructions*

Preheat oven to 350F. Line a rimmed 1318 baking sheet with parchment paper or a properly-sized silicone mat. Set aside.
Combine all ingredients except honey in a large bowl. Stir to evenly combine everything.
Add the honey to the nut mixture. Evenly stir it all in, coating everything evenly.
Pour the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Make sure to scrape everything out, the hemp hearts tend to stick to the bowl and spoon and you dont want to waste those little guys.

Bake in the preheated oven for 10-20 minutes, stirring once or twice after 10 minutes. Check periodically after 10 minutes to make sure its not burning. My ovens sweet spot is 16-17 minutes, stirring twice after the 10 minute mark. Youll notice the granola is an overall rich, golden color when its done.
Remove from oven, stir, and let cool completely on a wire rack. It will harden as it cools. Break up into bite-size pieces and store in an airtight container for up to one week to preserve the crunchiness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> She does this every couple of hours throughout the day and the night, it's completely random: she'll howl and then it could be a couple of hours or just 10min before she starts again - sometimes the howling can last up to a whopping five minutes! I have to put up with this for a couple of weeks at a time but it's completely sporadic when it comes to frequency. Sometimes she goes for months as just my lovable cat and then she pulls this madness for weeks. The longest I've gone without her howling was roughly eight months but sometimes it'll only be a month of bliss.

This time's been the longest she's continued, it's been a ridiculous three weeks of this howling! She won't howl if I'm looking directly at her (I had to hide to get this video), she'll howl when I'm in the room sleeping or just not looking but if I make eye-contact she'll stop and just stare me down - often she'll just walk out of my sight to howl.

I've given her catnip,[ this calming stuff](http://www.petsmart.ca/gsi/webstore/WFS/PETNA-PETCA-Site/en_CA/-/CAD/ViewProduct-Start?CategoryName=200050 CatalogName=36 SKU=36-5161167) and even tried using [this collar](http://amzn.com/B0026JAKWG) for a night and it did absolutely nothing.

She's 6 (I've had her since she was a tiny kitten), indoor-only, spaded, and eats science diet "indoor". She eats and drinks regularly and doesn't throw up much, maybe she'll throw up once every two to three weeks but my understanding's that it's pretty normal.

I did take her to a vet a few years back and show'd them a different video of her howling and they didn't know what to make of it, they shaved her belly to make sure there was a spade scar and proceeded to tell me that they'd have to analyze her stool for $250 on top of the $80 I've already paid for the consultation; I was unemployed at the time and did not have the funds for that. Here I am again unemployed (yet again) and cannot take her to the vet, so I'm asking reddit.

Any insight would be great! 

Thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only installation access I have is on a flash drive that I made on a different machine which needs isn't UEFI. I tried to create a recovery disk using my desktop but windows tells me that I'm missing files and if I have issues I should use my installation disk.

The built-in recovery ie booting from the recovery partition on the notebook just takes me windows restore and the only options I have are to factory reset or restore from a designated point in time. 

I guess at this point I'm going to have to mount the drive on my desktop to be able to use the utilman exploit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My version of the lenovo yoga 2 11 only allows me to boot GPT/UEFI and everyone suggests changing the BIOS to legacy after disabling secure boot [If you look at post #15](http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Idea-Windows-based-Tablets-and/Yoga-2-11-USB-boot/td-p/1463993/page/2) you can see that I'm in the same situation and simply do not have this option. 

I've tried dozens of bootable flash drives in my arsenal: linux distros, recovery tools, even my windows8 flash drive will not show up in the boot options (probably because it wasn't UEFI).

Of all of my tools the only flash drive that my lenovo even sees is the Clover bootloader, I was hoping there is a way to use Clover to boot into Trinity Rescue.

Any details on how I could accomplish this would be of tremendous help, thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> i've gone from 205 to 191 with zero exercise. energy has been great, before paleo, even the smallest of meals (sometimes light snacks) would make me sleepier than taking two benadryls! eating paleo so far has been fantastic in the health department, i look noticeably thinner all around and acid-reflux has been tremendously better as well. 

the only downsides are the amount of effort that has to be put in to cook, it takes me almost twice as long to cook my meals and grocery cost is a but higher but I think this lifestyle change will be for the better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In 2000(?) my high school principal was tricked into having a techno dance but it turned out to be a rave called Candyland, I of course attended as I indulged myself in a lot of raves back in those days. Seeing people fxcking in the bathroom, everyone smoking everything while rolling balls in the commons was quite the experience. Drugs, sex, debauchery and loud techno thumping for hours - the school was trashed by the end of it. I'm a proud alumni of Rampart High School, go class of 2002!

<TITLE> So... alcohol. Can I drink it? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-31 23:51:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm 30 and I'm just starting with Paleo, stumbled upon this solution because even the lightest of meals were putting me to sleep, 4 days of paleo and not a single meal has induced the coma!

On the weekends I drink quite heavily, I'm not at all a beer person but I do consume quite a large amount of tequila, clear "blanco" ie Patron Silver. In a single night I'll knock back roughly 15-18 1.5oz shots and I'll do this Friday night and Saturday night - but the other 5 days of the week zero alcohol consumption.

Obviously cavemen didn't have distilled liquor and I'm guessing that alcohol breaks down into sugars and carbs - so am I answering my own question there? 

Any info on alcohol regarding Paleo would be greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

edit:
I'm beginning to understand! so the directory ~/.conkyrc which houses mutiple text is the config files, so they need to be consolidated into a single text file named .conkyrc - i will experiment and see what i can come up with </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is there a way I can add all the windows8 updates to my bootable win8 USB? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-16 07:28:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So my friends and I all took advantage of the upgrade price when win8 first launched and of course the keys we have only work for a win8 build, not win8.1, which is fine and all but when we have to format for whatever reason (like a new pc build) we'll have to install via the usb key we created from the microsoft website.

the issue is that we have to endure hours of updates until we're caught up enough to upgrade to 8.1. my question is:

"is there a way where I can download all of the necessary updates and inject them into the win8 usb so that I can just let the install run and install all the required updates and be on my way to updating to 8.1 on basically the initial boot?"

my google-fu doesn't seem to be doing me any favors at the moment, any info would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TITLE> My drone's not taking off right and veers into a wall when trying to hover </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-27 05:34:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My drone takes off but at an angle, one of the motors stutters as it takes off at a weird angle - one of the motors continue to stutter as it veers into a wall at which point the flight is obviously over, all of this in a matter of seconds.

I've checked my propellers, they "seem fine" (i'm guessing i'm just looking for eveness and imperfections); looked at the cogs and such, nothing astray there; reset the drone with a toothpick multiple times, and i've pressed the 'flat trim' a thousand times but nothing has worked!

There's definitely something a matter with one of the motors, i'm not sure which one but if i just hold the drone and take off, i can hear stutters - i'll try and shoot a video and post it for clarity but in the meantime i would appreciate absolutely any input!

Thanks!  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-03-04 07:04:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've got 2 [EVGA 2GB GTX 670](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130784)s with a [3rd gen i](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116504)5 on a[ sabertooth z77](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131821) with a [OCZ 750W ZT](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817341052); all clocks are stock and am using the bundled [flimsy SLI Bridge](http://img.techpowerup.org/110216/SLI_Front.jpg) that came with my MOBO. NVIDIA Control panel seems to say that the SLI is fine (as far as I can tell).  

I'm running benchmarks at 1440 via display port on a dell ips monitor. When I run heaven and valley w/o SLI enabled I can run the benchmark all the way through but when I enable SLI my monitor basically gets disconnected after 2 or 3 scenes during the benchmark sequences (it especially struggles when changing scenes), I can still hear the benchmark audio for about a minute until there's a sound glitch and the whole rig locks up forcing me to have to do a manual restart.

I've googled far and wide and have re-installed the drivers but haven't had any luck, I've also ordered the an [EVGA branded SLI bridge](http://amzn.com/B00F93S5DM) and it should be here at the end of week but in the meantime I was wondering if anyone has any insight on this issue that doesn't concern the bridge itself.

Thanks for anything ahead of time! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I design everything for FAZE, my goal is to try and normalize ecigs, i've been vaping since forever (first youtube video was like 4 years ago) - I try and influence as much of the decision  making as I can but it's hard to make cases when the higher-ups don't understand anything. I've been pushing for low-res clearos, variable voltage and even pitched a proposal to developing a mod!

There's just too many factors when working for a big company that still thinks ciga-likes are "in"; after convincing the execs to at least start with ego-style batteries I freshened up form-factor of the ego and threw a micro-usb-passthrough port on it instead of that outdated mini USB. The packaging used to be sleek and mature too until the execs changed it to that POS you see now http://i.imgur.com/jUsD2Yd.jpg 

I feel so ashamed when I read all the negative things about my product line because I've fought tooth and nail to get it right but at the end of the day I've got to follow what the owner of the company wants and so much compromise is made =[

This particular display was designed for a different company to add their juice above ours but we have no affiliation with vaporX, in fact, they are our direct competition - our juices are ok, they aren't bad but as a person who sells a ton of DiY to friends and family, the FAZE line of juices doesn't compare.

Awesome to see my work show up in the wild! =] 

TLDR: I design all facets of the FAZE brand and I influence as much as I can but execs shoot it all down and many compromises are made, I feel bad and do apologize. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I've got a question about DACs </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-29 22:48:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm currently on a S4 and with the stock t-mobile rom: my portable DAC/AMP FiiO e17 worked fine with an OTG cable (system-wide actually, not just media apps) but i recently upgraded to a kitkat rom (KOT49H to be exact) and suddenly my OTG functionality stopped working! 

I currently use PlayerPRO to listen to my audio which used to work fine with the e17 but now it doesn't recognize it as an audio output; my assumption was that it was broken system wide but then i downloaded a trial version of "USB Audio Player PRO" (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.extreamsd.usbaudioplayerpro) and this app recognizes my e17 fine! So this leads be to believe it's app dependent.  I downloaded the trial version of Poweamp (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxmpz.audioplayer) and this app doesn't recognize the e17 either!

USB Audio Player PRO seems to be the only app that works with the DAC but the UI is horrendous and the media browser is absolutely minimal (you can't even browse directories). 

TLDR: Anyone know of a good audio player that will let me set the audio output to USB that doesn't have a terrible UI?

Love the show! </TEXT>

<TEXT> they wired all the boards with reverse polarity and it was shorting out also, the power supply isn't powerful enough to run the board. the reversed polarities are completely inconsistent: sometimes it's this wire that's backwards then sometimes it's another. lastly, there's this strange interference the board is picking up that seems to only come through on certain speakers. 

we're short on manpower and weeding out all those wires on 200 different boards just isn't cost-effective. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I work for a small company in wheat ridge that is trying to make an interactive display for bluetooth speakers and headphones. We've already built the displays but the Chinese electronics are faulty and we're looking to replace the "guts" of the display. 

We've talked about building an arduino board that will house a single SD card and components that will allow us to switch between outputs but have hit a wall.

Does anyone know of a place locally that can produce 200 units fairly quickly? 

Any other solutions/suggestions would be great!

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Tryptophan, caffeine and other "active" additives to juices </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-06 20:15:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've got a bottle of 5ml bottle "Relaxation" from herbs2vape that I have yet to vape. Their ingredients list tryptophan, GABA, and melatonin; what do you guys think about these "functional" additives to juices? 

I'm guessing the dosage is minimal which means the effect must also be minimal. My guess is absorbing via lungs for these ingredients have to minuscule as our lungs don't really "metabolize" these type things as well as our digestive system. Maybe to have an effect there needs to be some sort of calculation of strength like what we do with our nicotine? 

How safe and effective can juices like this be?

On their site they're listing all kinds of "active juices" like 'Alert', 'Energy', 'Breathe', 'Flex', 'Intamcy', and 'Lean' - I feel like this type of evolution is the kind of thing that takes us closer to FDA coming down hard on us vapers. 

herbs2vape and nutricigs are the only two I know that making these type juices in the "mainstream" - I've also heard of some off-brand juice-makers doing the same thing.

Thoughts? comments?

<TEXT> Thanks for the input - after hours and hours of forum searching I've come up with an idea. I took the PCB off of the drive and some of the leads look burned, I'm guessing this is what's causing intermittent power. I've tried to clean the leads but with no avail.

I scoured the internet and found several sites that offer replacement PCBs for the drive and have made an order, found one for $20 after shipping - hopefully I can just replace the PCB and this will be the end of it; it'd be a great bonus if the PCB restored the drive functionality completely!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> My mom's hard drive needs help! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-05-13 00:02:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My mom's hard drive has thousands of family photos and I've been working for days to recover the photos. The data on the drive is fine but something's shorted with the interface; I have it mounted via Seagate external mount (SATA to USB3) and the drive mounts fine and stays mounted so long as I'm not pulling data, when I start to pull data it runs for about two minutes, sometimes a little longer but it always ends up losing power - it takes about a minute or so for the drive to come back and mount and the cycle starts all over again when I try and pull pictures.

I've got about 600GB of data that I'm trying to move into my local drive before I move it to a portable drive for her but it's annoying to say the least to have to sit there and watch for when the drive loses power in order to continue copying. 

It's strange, the drive has its moments where it'll run and read for 10minutes and when it loses power it wont read a single file unless I detach it from my Seagate interface for a while. I've tried all kinds of other ways to mount the bare drive but it seems that the issue is clearly with the drive itself. 

I figured it could be a temperature issue so now I've got the whole setup sitting on top of a ziplock container full of ice but it doesn't seem to make a difference. 

Any suggestions aside from bringing the drive to professionals? I looked into doing a platter transfer but it seems way too risky. I'd be extremely grateful for any input, thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, my first pen over $30 is the TWSBI 580 (which I ordered yesterday as soon as I heard they were available) and won't be investing in anymore pens for a very long while much less vintage flex pens or custom pens.

I've been fiddling with the Noodler's flex pens on and off for a couple of months and I cannot get them to write properly. I've tried carving out the channels for better flow, moved the nibs up and down, tried various speeds and pressures in my writing but I cannot replicate anything on youtube - as soon as I flex the nib it'll be ok for about 3-4 strokes and it railroads and won't write for quite a long time. 

I've done the "fill-with-water" and then draw the water out through a paper-towel and I *do* get bubbles, so the feed *seems* fine - so maybe my tines aren't set right? (I've never adjusted the nib tines, ever.) I have no idea why it's so inconsistant, even non-flex writing my two noodler's flex pens dont flow right regardless of how fast/slow I'm writing. 

Any pointers or suggestions? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have an extensive amount of tweezers at my disposal but none of them are strong enough to bend nibs back into place, anyone know where I can find a pair of tweezers that has the leverage/strength of pliers but are thin and small like needle-nose tweezers? What do you guys use to realign nibs? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I've recently been obsessed with fountain pens which (after hours of internet surfing) has lead me to calligraphy; today a few of the pens I ordered came in - including this badass pilot parallel. I've never calligraphed in my life before although I've spent a lot of my life tagging, so here's my very first ever attempt (I know I'm missing an 'L' sorry). http://i.imgur.com/ITfPsRh.jpg </TEXT>

<TEXT> thanks. yeah, i do have a couple rimless glasses but I guess i've just grown tired of the style - i ended up going with fatheadz, turns out what i'm really looking for are glasses that have a total eye-width of 60mm or more. the sales person i spoke with said she's run into many situations (especially men) where the patient needed/wanted wider frames but designers don't ever seem to accommodate for them, having a really heavy prescription doesn't help either =/ </TEXT>

<TITLE> DAE miss pre-rendered FMV cutscenes? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-01-10 21:44:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It feels like I'm the only person out there that really misses having a bunch of high-quality pre-rendered FMV cutscenes. Sure, with the current state hardware in-engine cutscenes look worlds better than what we used to have but pre-rendered has evolved as well! I recently beat Dark Souls hoping there'd be an epic ending similar to the intro FMV but was severely disappointed with a 30sec in-engine animation; yes I understand it's "more immersive" with my custom character but I want to be rewarded with "ooh's" and "ahh's" throughout the story. Am I crazy or am I just nostalgic for the days of FFVII where cutscenes were blowing my mind? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a GTX 670 and my PC is hooked up via HDMI to a Samsung D7000 series 3D TV. My google-fu isn't fairing well with how I'd enable 3D Vision, I've come across this: 

http://3dvision-blog.com/8394-how-to-get-the-best-stereo-3d-experience-in-borderlands-2/

and followed through to: 

http://helixmod.blogspot.com/2012/09/borderlands-2-3d-vision-patch.html

but I have no idea where to start to enable 3D Vision. I tried clicking on "Enable 3D Vision" in the Nvidia folder then run the game but it turns off after hitting "Play" at the splash screen; it's not supposed to be in the game settings is it? There doesn't seem to be any clear tutorials out there, hoping reddit could help. I currently have everything "maxed out" in video settings but nothing seems to be working.

I've never tried 3D PC gaming so all of this is relatively new to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> you could be having an allergic reaction to the PG (propylene glycol) - try vaping juices that are more or completely VG (vegetable glycerin).

I have a friend that does nothing but metal and they seem to always be hiring too, he works at http://www.cdmetalproducts.com/ it's a bit further north but the company seems to be thriving - also, I'm not 100% sure what they do but I know they work with metal lol

<TITLE> Yesterday marked my 5 year anniversary of involuntary single life and living alone (a TLDR open rant) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-08-20 21:52:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not looking for karma or anything, this post is purely therapeutic.

I'm one of those *cheesy/hopeless romantic/chivalry's not dead* types who has has now been single for 5 years, 5 years since I've even been on a date let alone kiss a girl or even held a girls hand. I'm 28 now and I've only had 4 girlfriends my entire life (3 of which were relationships) the last of which ended quite horribly. 

My most recent ex moved in with me before we even got together (I've been completely independent since I was 17), we were together for 4 years: obviously living together for a little while longer than that, bought a car together and one day I bought a town home for her  a few months after the purchase of an overpriced town home (we got it right before the market collapsed) she decided she can't handle not being able to go shopping every weekend and at the same time her parents had just opened up a business in PA, she tells me she needs to go help her parents in PA (we live in CO, her parents had moved to PA about two years into our relationship) and we agreed on trying the long distance relationship thing, in not even a week after her moving to help her parents with the business her and her family suddenly leave the country for a couple months, we promised to keep in contact while she vacationed overseas but I ended up hearing from her once during this time for a brief moment on yahoo chat, even the short e-mails I sent about every 10 days were never responded to. She finally comes stateside and I texted her "welcome back" and it takes her over a week to respond "thanks"; shortly after this I receive a myspace message from her, a message that barely constitutes as a paragraph breaking up with me  yes, she ended our 4-year-living-together-relationship in a tiny myspace message. There were no signs of serious turmoil or distress in the relationship before this and it was over just like that, no rhyme or reason.

A month passes and I get laid off, the company I was currently designing for filed bankruptcy and had laid off 70% of the workforce and later completely went out of business closing every retail store in the nation. I become unemployed for the next two years which adds to the depression and stress which finally ends up causing my current foreclosure on the town home. When it rains, it fucking pours. To be clear, I fought tooth and nail and exhausted every option I could to keep the town house.

I've been living alone the last 5 years and it's one of the most depressing things I've had to endure. Being single with a roommate or living with family is one thing but living completely alone is a whole different story, although I did manage to get a cat a couple years ago but I think that's irrelevant. Anyhow, just last week I moved into an old rundown apartment and settling in is as hard as ever not to mention the packing and moving! Quite a downgrade from the town home I had, everything is old and unfamiliar, unpacking and setting up is a chore, no air conditioning makes everything worse and the paper-thin walls make the it seem like my neighbors are in my home, oh and did I mention that there's a train that comes by every 2 hours? Sorry, I digress, I could *almost* tolerate being alone in a familiar place but now in unknown territory it's a blatant punch to the face constantly reminding me just how lonely my life is.

At this age it feels impossible to meet new people let alone meeting members of the opposite sex who don't have kids. My friends are no help because during the early stages of the single life I fell into a younger crowd (some of them are just now turning 19); these young friends of mine if aren't single, have girlfriends who are the type to say "I dont hang out with girls" so there's no help there; the single ones are bringing around even younger single girls: 16-18 which feels a bit too young for someone who'll be 29 in November not to mention that there's almost no common ground; my work as a designer has landed me in a position where I'm one of the youngest in the company, everyone around me is in their 40's (married, divorced, old, etc.); night clubs and bars are all full of women who are there strictly to dance or are there for their girlfriends celebrating some sort of occasion and are not at all open to being asked out (IMO these places are a terrible place to pick up women: screaming at a girl when you first meet her cannot be good). I've tried plenty free online dating sites none of which has landed taken me anywhere, what the heck else is there to do?

Heading into this fifth year has made me question everything! I seem to be too nice, trying to be an asshole just doesn't fit me, I can't just up and completely change my personality and adopt being an asshole. Was I some sort of rapist the past life and am now being punished for it? What have I done to be punished like this? Why is it that I've got all this pent-up love and no chance to share it? Growing up geek and nerdy makes it hard for me to dumb down to gossipy *jersey shore* types, would I be happier dumber? Ignorance is bliss isn't it? I was built to love, I never knew what *cooties* were as a child, I can even remember my first crush in the 2nd grade. I have always pursued being/becoming the best boyfriend any girl has ever known - I am meticulously observant of my past relationships and others as to avoid all mistakes, I am terrible at being single but I make an awesome significant other: I don't smoke, I'm an accomplished chef, I'm artistic, professional designer, musically inclined, smart, educated, sensitive, funny, passionate, dedicated, determined, independent, love kids - I don't mean to toot my own horn here but the list goes on and on. I'll always put her first but am extremely self conscious not to smother her, I don't think I'm overweight, I'm 5'10 and semi-athletic, I don't think I'm short, I'm super open minded and I basically have no one who thinks ill of me (well at least not to my knowledge). I don't think it's a confidence issue - physical appearance is the only thing I can't subjectively judge myself on besides body mass and in that category I don't think's an issue, I may not have washboard abs but I don't have no buddha belly.

These past 5 years have lead me to become this emotional wreck inside although it's covered with a flawless facade that I've been perfecting since day one I assure you I'm truly dying inside, for example at times of watching "How I met your mother" it will occasionally make me tear up like a little girl because I feel so much for some of the situations; I've been so jaded that seeing any couple (fictional or real-life) makes me feel like a they're mocking my very existence and jabbing at how much of failure my relationship status has been. Now I've gotten this irrationalization that I'm in the wrong locale, that I can't meet women because I'm in Colorado, that Silicon Valley, NYC, Toronto or Tokyo is where I was meant to be - it sends me into an even deeper into the spiral knowing that I'll never leave a stable job to pursue any of these places. My mind always feels like it's running a mile a minute thinking about how shitty this life is (and here I thought my depression was supposed to subside after the teenage life). 

Inside I'm curled up in the alone in the dark yearning contact outside of friendship, hoping to discard the mask and finally have some sort of direction in my life but after five years of this my legs are starting to buckle and as I near 30 I'm starting to just doubt all of life; what's the point of anything if you can't intimately share it with someone? I mean at this point I'd settle for being friendzoned, hell, just being able to hang out with people that share common passions would be nice - don't get me wrong I absolutely love my friends and wouldn't trade them for the world but none of them truly have any common ground with me. There isn't even anyone close to being a potential girlfriend, I'd feel slightly better if I even had a crush on someone, at least then I'd have some sort of direction to go in, some sort of goal I could try and achieve. I am extremely self-conscious and I know I'm overly fixated on the situation but after 5 long freaking years of this bullshit I can't help but to do so. It just feels hopeless, utterly, utterly hopeless  end rant.


I know no one will read this especially because it's especially TLDR but writing it and having it public outside of people who know me makes me feel a nano bit better.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> there was a little trick i used to use: if they sell it in your state, get a pint of EVERCLEAR liquor and add a few drops of it to your liquid, it's pure grain alcohol at 180 proof, i hear you can use unflavored triple distilled vodka but i've never tried that before. personally I don't like doing it too much because I find that it degradates the flavor but i do still use it to make menthol concentrate. try that out and add more drops as needed, start with a 5ml bottle and keep track of how my drops you put in per ml (eg 5drops in a 5ml bottle would be 1drop per ml and so forth) and remember your preference when you mix up another batch in a higher volume.

alternatively you can start weaning yourself to a lower mg so that your throat gets used to something like 12mg and then every 30ml go up a step e.g. 12mg to 16mg after 30ml then 16mg to 18mg and then 18mg to 24mg, once you hit 24mg start the cycle over - the period where you go back to 12mg will be painful but once you're used to it it'll be satisfying when you start climbing up again. hope that helps, happy vaping! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Help! Looking for a good flatbed plotter cutter </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-06-08 18:05:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So my company does a lot of package design mock-ups and cards so we're constantly having to make very intricate cuts on card-stock and we're having issues with our Graphtech FC2250-150, the blades we get are always breaking and the software doesn't work very well (pressure, speed and quality settings don't translate from the Illustrator plugin to the machine). 

The company is looking to replace the Graphtech and have asked me to find something more reliable. Reddit designers I need your help! I don't really know too much about industrial plotters and the only two names that ever come up in this category are Graphtech and Mimaki, anyone out there have opinion on the matter? We'd like to go with a company with good customer service, we have a Mimaki CJV30-130 which has excellent customer service but are unsure how much better their flatbed cutter would be compared to the Graphtech.

Is there only two big boys out there that make these machines? I'm also assuming that laser cutting paper is out of the question.

We mostly cut paper products for packaging with the occasional cardboard for making display stands but more importantly card-stock, for instance we'll have to cut 5000 cards with custom die-lines and hang holes, the Graphtech just can't handle that much work. 

Any input is appreciated, sorry for writing so much, so in summary I'm looking for an industrial flatbed plotter cutter that can handle cutting through card-stock with reputable customer service in Colorado, the budget is allowing me around $20,000. Thank you Reddit! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Replacement Film for Otterbox Defender? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-04-26 23:12:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A while back I dropped my iPad2 due to a faulty strap on my bag and it cracked my screen; now with my new iPad I decided to avoid the same fate I got myself the new Otterbox Defender case, there's a huge issue with this case, it comes with this built-in screen protector and the film otterbox uses absolutely ruins the iPad's retina display. The screen protector refracts light giving the illusion of enlarged pixels and basically makes the retina display look like the old iPad2 - I'm looking for a film I can buy to replace this garbage stock film, anyone know of any non-adhesive-capacitive-touch material I can buy? 

I want to avoid putting on a screen protector (with adhesive ie invisible shield) on the iPad itself and stick with having a seal between the otterbox's case frame and the iPad so that I can avoid building up gunk between the frame and the iPad. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Looking for a place to live (Trailers Vs Apartment) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-03-30 18:50:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've owned a place around Colorado and 104th for a while, bought the place before the market crashed and mortgage is outrageous, I wanted to refi a couple years in but the mortgage difference wasn't great enough (it would be if I refi'd now though but I'd have to be current), tried for a home modification loan and failed three times and ended up over 30K behind on mortgage so now I'm forced to short sell the house or face foreclosure - anyhow I've been searching CL, trulia and zillow for months and the only things I can find in my price range ($950/mo) are apartments or trailers. Anyone have experience with the double-wide-type trailers? I really don't want to have any upstairs/downstairs neighbors and a garage would be nice but it seems farfetched at the my rate. The most frustrating thing about this is I could buy a home and easily have all my desired amenities and still be in budget if there wasn't a 2yr waiting period to buy after a short sale. I freaking bought the townhome for 182K, the value now is 110K and I'm short selling it for around 105K, absolutely horrid right? I have a small well-behaved-indoor-only cat and a crap ton of stuff so a townhome or house would be ideal. Wow ok, sorry, I'm realize I'm rambling - the stress has been insane the last few months, I digress and will stop here. 

*TLDR Version* I'm looking for a place to live that is not an apartment where rent does not go above $950/mo preferably in the TWN area. I have a small indoor-only cat and no other pets - any information would be a tremendous help! thank you ahead of time all you lovely redditors! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Anyone have an easy explanation to oblivious clients on pricing of design? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-01-19 18:45:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know I ran into an infographic a while back that broke down the cost of designing various projects for clients but can't find it for the life of me. Anyhow, I'm an in-house graphic designer that picks up freelance gigs on the side and one of the most frustrating things to deal with is clients that just don't understand design pricing; for example I could say I charge $40/hr but to make a tri-fold brochure but offer a flat rate of $350 (depending on company size) for the entire design and the client will end up resenting the price because they don't believe it'll take almost 9hrs to complete, yes in reality it doesn't take that long but I don't know how to explain the hours that are added for things like overhead, education, talent, skill etc. I don't want to come off as some high-and-mighty douche but I can't come up with a way to explain that it's not necessarily an hourly rate - so many people are fixated on hourly labor rates without giving the education and talent cost a single thought, any suggestions on a simple way to explain 'why the project costs this much' even though it's not exactly the amount of hours put in? </TEXT>

<TITLE> [TOMT] This is a long shot but I've been trying to figure what the hell this was for years (TV SHOW) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-12-20 20:48:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm from Colorado, when I was younger (I'm 28 now) there was this weird TV show that came on late at night on the public access channel unfortunately I don't remember what channel but if it helps I never had cable, it was all over-the-air.

I stumbled upon it quite a lot (in the 720, 303 and 719 area), the show was in black and white, very grainy and had this guy in an apron wearing a skull-like mask with long dark hair standing behind a table butchering meat, I can't remember what he was talking about but it definitely was not about the meat he was chopping up nor his giant cleaver, I remember his voice was all distorted much like how jigsaw presents himself in the SAW series; i do remember his topics were completely random and always thinking to myself "WTF is this!? and how the hell has it been on all these years?". There were no cuts, the camera just stood still directly across from the table showing the entire table and everything of the host from the waist up.

Anyone have any clue as to what I'm talking about? Was it some sort of pirate show? I've been searching for years just to satisfy my curiosity, I can't be the only person to have come across this show and I'm absolutely sure I didn't imagine it, if anyone could figure it out it'd be the redditors - thanks ahead of time and if you're just baffled from this post: my apologies.

EDIT: when I say "pirate" I didn't mean "arrrggghhh mate-ee" pirate, I meant as in a pirate show like "pirate radio" something more along the lines of unapproved broadcast.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> i'm not looking for any sympathy or upvotes or any responses, i just wanted to post this as a therapeutic exercise.

so i decided to buy a new TV for my dad since he still has a giant CRT in his room and father's day was coming up, i went on craigslist and found a nice 32" and the guy i dealt with only communicated through e-mail (should have been my first clue) but we eventually met up and he was an older caucasian man, looked trust worthy. i inspected the tv, the screen looked fine but i didnt think to turn it on as we were in the middle of a parking lot and there wasn't an outlet available; i gave him $250 and we were both on on way. 

i came home and wouldn't you know it the LCD was broken, the screen was cracked behind the glass (not visible when turned off at all) and when turned on all you could see was a black blob atop of a white screen. i lost $250 on a shoestring budget from attempting a good gesture for my dad. 

lesson here is to always make sure you deal over the phone via text or calling. i live in colorado and this guy's e-mail is msalas4973@gmail.com last i saw him was in a forest green escalade, older guy, do not trust this man! 

the thing that irks me the most is that i always have a power inverter in the car albeit may not be strong enough to power the flat panel but i could have at least tried. god, hindsight has never been more of a bitch. </TEXT>
