<TEXT>  The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad! Mr. Trump wrote in an early morning post on Twitter.

 Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike, he added in another post shortly afterward. When things calm down, they will be thanking me!

 The tweets followed a similar one posted late Tuesday night specifically targeting Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate Democratic leader. Cryin Chuck Schumer stated recently, I do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer. Then acts so indignant. #drainthe swamp.

<TEXT>  The choice of DeVos sparked immediate backlash last week among many students and alumni of the Florida university, who signed a petition asking the school to rescind her invitation. The petition referenced an "unsettling" remark made in February by DeVos, who praised historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) as "pioneers" of the school choice movement, even though they were founded to provide educational opportunities to black students who were shut out of other institutions.

 "Secretary DeVos has no understanding of the importance, contributions, and significance of HBCUs," the petition said. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The decision to invite DeVos to speak at the school last Tuesday caused public outcry because of comments that she previously made calling historically black colleges and universities "real pioneers" of school choice.

 DeVos later backtracked, saying that the schools weren't established to give black students more choices, but because black students were forbidden from attending white schools because of racial segregation.

 "Multiple allegations have surfaced, including faculty intimidation demanding their silence or (risking) termination," Nweze said. "And (there were accusations of) threats to students by potentially withholding earned degrees and fines for freedom of expression."

 Several attorneys have already agreed to represent faculty and students who peacefully protested DeVos' speech and who might face retaliation from the university, Nweze said.

 "Our partners have reviewed the university student code of conduct, and it does not contain any prohibition on peaceful protests and freedom of expression," Nweze said. "The NAACP Volusia County Daytona Beach Branch and several attorneys will be on the ground monitoring this situation." </TEXT>

<TEXT>  A former political director to President George W. Bush said Wednesday she found the news of James Comey's firing "dumbfounding."

 "Even if you assume that their intentions were pure, and they fired him because of competence reasons, this just stinks to high heaven," Sara Fagen, a CNBC contributor, said on "Squawk Box."

 Also on the show, former CIA agent John Sipher said Comey's firing likely won't end the FBI's investigation into possible links between Russia and President Donald Trump's campaign.

 The Trump administration "tends to look at intelligence officers, law enforcement, judiciary and assume they're part of the partisan process and treat them as such," Sipher said. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  White House press secretary Sean Spicer wrapped up his brief interview with Fox Business from the White House grounds late Tuesday night and then disappeared into the shadows, huddling with his staff behind a tall hedge. To get back to his office, Spicer would have to pass a swarm of reporters wanting to know why President Trump suddenly decided to fire the FBI director.

 For more than three hours, Spicer and his staff had been scrambling to answer that question. Spicer had wanted to drop the bombshell news in an emailed statement but it was not transmitting quickly enough, so he ended up standing in the doorway of the press office around 5:40 p.m. and shouting a statement to reporters who happened to be nearby. He then vanished, with his staff locking the door leading to his office. The press staff said that Spicer might do a briefing, then announced that he definitely wouldn't say anything more that night. But as Democrats and Republicans began to criticize and question the firing with increasing levels of alarm, Spicer and two prominent spokeswomen were suddenly speed-walking up the White House drive to defend the president on CNN, Fox News and Fox Business. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Rumors have been swirling that the end to this reality show would come as early as Tuesday, when the White House had reportedly scheduled another meeting to examine its options. Ivanka Trump also was supposed to meet with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt earlier on Tuesday, but the White House did not confirm if that meeting ever took place. Discussions on the climate deal were canceled without much explanation, but when White House press secretary Sean Spicer was asked about the progress Tuesday, he replied that the president "wants to make sure he has an opportunity to meet with his team." Trump has now decided he won't decide on Paris until after G-7 meetings later this month in Italy, once more because he wants to "meet with his team." </TEXT>

 On Tuesday, Attorney General Sessions used the same incident, cited by his deputy attorney general, to fire Comey.

 Sessions was citing the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was appointed to his position two weeks earlier and on Tuesday criticized Comey in a three-page memo over his handling of the email investigation. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Comey's firing was part of a "deeply troubling pattern from the Trump administration," that appears to be linked to two other high-profile dismissals.

 "They fired Sally Yates. They fired Preet Bharara. And they fired James Comey, the very man leading he investigation. This does not seem to be a coincidence," Schumer said shortly after the announcement, calling for a special independent prosecutor into the Trump campaign's ties to the Kremlin.

 "Any person who he appoints to lead the Russian investigation will be concerned that he or she will meet the same fate as Director Comey," he said </TEXT>

Nixon ordered the Attorney General to abolish the office of special prosecutor. Refusing to do so and in protest, the Attorney General Elliot Richardson and the Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus resigned.  Nixon then turned to the U.S. Solicitor General Robert Bork, to carry out the firing of the special prosecutor. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  FCC spokesman Mark Wigfield said late Monday that the Federal Communications Commission has updated its systems to a cloud service that should be more resilient against attacks. He affirmed that there had been a cyberattack on the agency's site Sunday, and said that the agency also suffered an attack in 2014 after Oliver's previous segment.

 But the agency's statement has raised skepticism from consumer advocacy group Fight for the Future. The group said in a statement that it finds the timing of the attack too coincidental. The group raised questions about whether the FCC was diagnosing the slowdown correctly, or whether an outside attack could have been launched specifically to keep Oliver's viewers from commenting.

 The FCC should immediately release its logs to an independent security analyst or major news outlet to verify exactly what happened last night, said the group's campaign director, Evan Greer.

<TEXT>  A super PAC aligned with the House Republican leadership and Speaker Paul Ryan (Wisc.) released a new ad Tuesday attacking Democrat Jon Ossoff for raising most of his campaign cash from out-of-state donors in the runoff to fill an open U.S. House seat in Georgia.

 The CLF ad features an array of young liberals thanking Georgians for supporting Ossoff.

 Hi Georgia, Nancy Pelosi just wanted to say thank you, says one woman wearing an Ossoff-Pelosi t-shirt.

 We already have Nancy Pelosi as our congresswoman, now youre going to give us Jon Ossoff as our congressman, says a man with pigtail braids.

 Were proud that California is the leading funder of the Jon Ossoff campaign, says another. Were really excited that Jon Ossoff likes paying higher taxes.

 They go on to accuse Ossoff and Pelosi of seeking to weaken the military and failing to take ISIS seriously. 

 "ISIS?" says a woman wearing a floppy hat and a "Cut the military now!" button. "They're overrated."

 San Francisco loves them some Jon Ossoff, a man in the ad concludes. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified Monday that she told the White House that then-National Security Adviser Mike Flynn could be blackmailed by the Russians, because he misled the vice president about his problematic conduct.

 We were concerned that the American people had been misled about the underlying conduct and what General Flynn had done, Yates told a Senate Judiciary subcommittee.

 That reference to the underlying conduct is frustratingly vague, but of critical importance. Much of the focus in recent months has been on Mike Flynn lying about his communications with Russia, but Yates took this a step further: Flynns false claims were problematic, but so is the conduct he was lying about.

 We dont know what that conduct is  the information is classified  but it raises the seriousness of the controversy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  How do you sell a health care bill that cuts insurance for the poor, allows states to waive essential health benefits like maternity care, and allows insurers to charge impossible sums to people with pre-existing conditions, all to cut taxes for the richest 2 percent of Americans?

 You lie about it.

 Leaders have opted to talk up the virtues of a plan that looks nothing like the one they just voted for. The American Health Care Act cuts $880 billion from Medicaid over a 10-year period. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that as a result, 14 million fewer people would have Medicaid coverage by 2026.

 Price, unfazed, denied that the cuts even existed. Remember that there are no cuts to the Medicaid program. There are increases in spending, said the secretary. When an incredulous Tapper pressed againAre you actually saying that $880 billion in cuts  is actually not going to result in millions of Americans not getting Medicaid?Price went further, insisting that the Medicaid population will be cared for in a better way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Please watch the video before you comment because the headline was not the basis for the question.

 The interview started out friendly enough. Josh Scheinblum of the ABC affiliate KCRG pointed out to Blum that the people attending his recent town hall meeting needed to provide identification to prove that they were residents of the his district. After Blum replied that he only wanted people from his district to attend, Scheinblum pointed out that some would make the case that you represent all Iowans. The decisions that you make impact all Iowans. So shouldnt all Iowans have a voice at the table, or at least have the option to?

 Blum laughed and replied, I dont represent all Iowans. I represent only the first district of Iowa. That would be like saying, Shouldnt I be able to, even though I live in Dubuque, go vote in Iowa City during the election, because Id like to vote in that district instead?

 Would you still take donations from a Republican in Iowa City? Scheinblum then asked, causing lum to walk out after only two minutes.

 As Blum stood up and unclipped his microphone, Scheinblum seemed genuinely surprised that the interview was being cut off. Blum, on the other hand, denounced the line of questioning as ridiculous and accused Scheinblum of wanting to badger him with his questions.

<TEXT>  The bill as it stands would have the potential to alter insurance coverage in two major areas  by nixing coverage requirements for employees at larger companies, and by  theoretically  making it possible for employees at larger companies to have to pay an unlimited amount for so-called "essential" health care benefits out of pocket. 

 On the first point, employees would no longer be guaranteed health insurance because their companies would no longer be required to provide it. The ACHA rolls back a key Affordable Care Act provision that required businesses with 50 or more employees to provide health insurance to employees working 30 hours or more a week. 

 The slightly-more-complex implication of the House GOP bill on employer-based coverage means employees at large companies could theoretically pay an unlimited amount for health care on an annual or lifetime basis. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Texas senator Ted Cruz spent much of his time at the mic asking Clapper about emails without really making a clear point. Then he moved onto Yates, quoting the statute that basically said as President, Trump can decide to deny anyone entry to the country if he thinks they'd be "detrimental to the interest of the United States."

 Without pausing, Yates said she was familiar with that statute, and busted out her own, which said "no person shall receive preference or be discriminated against in issuance of a visa because of race, nationality or place of birth." Then, without waiting for Cruz to try another jab, she said she wasn't focused on either statute, so much as "whether or not the executive order here violated the Constitution specifically with the establishment clause and equal protection and due process." </TEXT>

 Yates told the panel that she had a meeting with White House Counsel Donald McGahn on January 26 to tell him that she had information that statements by Vice President Mike Pence, based on his conversations with Flynn, were false. She was joined in the meeting by a senior career official in the Justice Department.

 "We weren't the only ones that knew all of this, that the Russians also knew about what General Flynn had done and the Russians also knew that General Flynn had misled the vice president and others," Yates said, relating the contents of her conversation with McGahn. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Lately, the GOP has been attacking the idea of states setting up retirement plans for small business, most of which offer no retirement options. The Senate majority recently voted against a plan to provide state-sponsored small-business retirement programs. President Trump is expected to sign this giant leap backward of a bill.

 The U.S. is the only modern, industrialized country without a uniform national pension system. Although there are dozens of retirement vehicles -- IRAs, 401ks, 403bs, SEP-IRAs, etc. -- employers are not required by law to offer any of them, nor are they required to fund them. It's such a scattershot approach that it should be a national embarrassment.

 Wall Street and insurers have also been working hard to snuff a Department of Labor "fiduciary rule" that would force broker-advisers to work in the best interest of their clients when offering retirement advice.

 That would have prevented financial product peddlers from selling high-commission, junk products. It also would've protected millions of retirees who are facing rollovers from their 401(k)s into other products such as annuities and IRAs.

<TEXT>  Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates is testifying Monday before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

 The highly anticipated hearing  it is Yatess first appearance on Capitol Hill since her firing in January  is expected to fill in key details in the chain of events that led to the ouster of Michael Flynn, President Donald Trumps first national security adviser, in the early weeks of the administration.

 Yates is likely to testify Monday that she warned White House counsel Don McGahn on Jan. 26 that Flynns contacts  and the discrepancies between what the White House said happened on the calls and what actually occurred  had left him in a compromised position, according to a person familiar with her expected statements. The person was not authorized to discuss the testimony by name and requested anonymity. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has chosen to replace half of the members on one of its key scientific review boards, the first step in a broader effort by Republicans to change the way the agency evaluates the scientific basis for its regulations.

 The move could significantly change the makeup of the 18-member Board of Scientific Counselors, which advises EPAs key scientific arm on whether the research it does has sufficient rigor and integrity. All of the members being dismissed were at the end of serving at least one three-year term, although these terms are often renewed instead of terminated.

 Pruitt is planning a much broader overhaul of how the agency conducts its scientific analysis, said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The administration has been meeting with academics to talk about the matter and putting thought into which areas of investigation warrant attention from the agencys scientific advisers. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Lawmakers and congressional staff are unlikely to face higher premiums or fewer health-care benefits as a direct result of the House Republicans health-care plan for one big reason: they work in the District of Columbia.

 Members of Congress and their aides are unlikely to feel the impact of these changes, however, because they generally obtain health insurance through the small-group exchange operated by the Affordable Care Act-friendly District of Columbia. If the D.C. government continues to enforce the ACAs protections, which most experts believe it will, lawmakers and staff could end up with more robust and less expensive coverage than constituents in states that are not as friendly to Obamacare.

 Republicans in the House and Senate are trying to revise the ACA using the budget reconciliation process, which imposes special rules about what can and cannot be included in legislation while allowing bills to pass the Senate by a simple-majority vote. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Every group working to unseat Republicans in 2018 is seeing an explosive growth in fundraising, Ben Wikler, Washington director for MoveOn, said in a phone interview with The Daily Beast on Thursday. The electoral blowback has already begun.

 The AHCA, whose passage in the House was heralded as a victory by President Donald Trump, essentially limped to the finish line after a failure to get to a vote in March.

 Twenty Republicans voted against the bill, with many not knowing what exactly was in it or how much it would cost. The bill itself does not repeal Obamacare but rather gets rid of the mandate that requires people to carry insurance.

 Instead a new amendment to the legislation, offered by Rep. Tom MacArthur, would allow some states to charge higher premiums for people with pre-existing conditions (including but not limited to diabetes, pregnancy, and cancer) and the option to opt out of essential health benefit requirements from the Affordable Care Act. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Luke 10:25-37 New International Version (NIV)

**The Parable of the Good Samaritan**

25 On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. Teacher, he asked, what must I do to inherit eternal life?

26 What is written in the Law? he replied. How do you read it?

27 He answered, Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind[a]; and, Love your neighbor as yourself.[b]

28 You have answered correctly, Jesus replied. Do this and you will live.

29 But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, And who is my neighbor?

30 In reply Jesus said: A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. 31 A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. 32 So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. 33 But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. 34 He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. 35 The next day he took out two denarii[c] and gave them to the innkeeper. Look after him, he said, and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.

36 Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?

37 The expert in the law replied, The one who had mercy on him.

Jesus told him, Go and do likewise.

 I hope to see more in the future regarding other equally important notions of religious liberty, particularly ones that impact Christian business owners and allowing them to deny service on religious grounds. 

I don't think you are a Christian. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Trump's executive order, which he will sign on Thursday to coincide with the National Day of Prayer, calls for easing of Internal Revenue Service enforcement of the so-called "Johnson Amendment," which prohibits churches from getting directly involved in political campaigns.

 While only Congress can formally do away with the law, this will pave the way for churches and other religious leaders to speak about politics and endorse candidates without worrying about losing their tax-exempt status.

 The Executive Order on Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty also aims to make it easier for employers with religious objections not to include contraception coverage in workers' health care plans, although it would be up to federal agencies to determine how that would happen </TEXT>

This does not cover people with preexisting conditions. And to come on the floor and say it does, to try to fool people, well, you may get away with it in the short term, you may get a headline but I tell you people will figure out soon enough when they are denied health care coverage.

 McGovern also slammed the GOP for pushing a bill that would rip away health care from an estimated 24 millions of Americans while at the same time cutting taxes for some of Americas wealthiest people.

 You should be ashamed, he said. To have a health care bill that cuts Medicaid by $880 billion so you can give a tax cut to the wealthiest people in this country, you should be ashamed. </TEXT>

 The AHCA, however, is set to defund the Medicaid health program by 25 percent, or $880 billion over the next decade. The cuts will affect both traditional and expanded coverage. Under one of the less talked about provisions of the new healthcare bill, states will not have to consider whether schools are eligible for Medicaid reimbursement. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  An amendment in the GOP health-care-reform bill will allow states to deny coverage for preexisting conditions, including sexual assault.

 Pre-Obamacare rape survivors who sought treatment for their injuries could be denied health care later on. Under Obamacare, preexisting conditions were guaranteed to receive coverage  among them, sexual assault. The American Health Care Act is going to change that.

 The new MacArthur-Meadows Amendment will allow states to discriminate based on medical history, reportedly without mitigating the subsequent high cost of health care for millions of Americans.

 In addition to **rape**, **postpartum depression**, **Cesarean sections**, and **surviving domestic violence** are all considered preexisting conditions. **Companies can also deny coverage for gynecological services and mammograms**.

Edit: bold the important parts </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Called the American Health Care Act, the Republican bill would repeal most Obamacare taxes, including a penalty for not buying health insurance. It would slash funding for Medicaid, the program that provides insurance for the poor, and roll back much of Medicaid's expansion.

 The latest effort comes after earlier pushes by Trump for healthcare reform collapsed twice, underscoring the difficulty of uniting the various factions of the Republican party.

 "Republicans have made Trumpcare even more dangerous and destructive than the last time they brought it to the floor," Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi wrote to her caucus in a letter late Wednesday night. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my mind if Hilary won, would it even be possible to go after Trump? GOP would do whatever they could to keep her from doing anything. They would try again with emails and all that shit. They would not even let an investigation into Trump go as far as Pennsylvania Ave. Hell, there wouldn't be a SCOTUS now even I bet because the GOP Senate would not allow it like before.

Now that Trump "won", they can actually do an investigation into it fully without the GOP crying fowl. If the GOP tried to hinder the investigation they would be facing millions marching on Washington. The GOP can try and fuck over the American people but we have Dems fighting for us. We have more people getting into government than ever before. We have people united on many ideals: science, civil rights, obamacare, than ever before.

Yes, it sucks incredibly hard but if this gets rid of the roots choking our democracy, I am for it. Who knows, if everything is proved true there might be many more Republicans leaving office because of this. </TEXT>

The thing that gets me is Comey said in the last open hearing that he "used to be a registered Republican"

 "Although our politics are different  I gather you're a Republican  that correct?" Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) asked Comey in prefacing his remarks.

 Comey responded, "I have been a registered Republican for most of my adult life, not registered any longer."

<TEXT>  There was Donald Trump, in a message filmed several years before he was elected president of the United States, declaring that the skyscraper bearing his name near the Philippine capital would be something very, very special, like nobodys seen before. Then there was his daughter Ivanka Trump, now a senior White House adviser, lavishing praise on the project as a milestone in Philippine real estate history.

 Four months into President Trumps tenure, his business relationship with a developer who is one of the Philippines richest and most powerful men has emerged as a prime example of the collision between the private interests of a businessman in the White House and his public responsibility to shape U.S. foreign policy.

 The potential conflict first came into focus shortly before Trump was elected, when the Philippines iron-fisted president, Rodrigo Duterte, named the Trump Organizations partner on the Manila real estate venture his top trade envoy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The EPA removed most climate change information from its website Friday, saying in a press release that language on the website is being updated to "reflect the approach of new leadership."

 EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has expressed doubt about the reasons for climate change, saying in a CNBC interview in March that he was skeptical of the role carbon dioxide plays.

 "I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there's tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact," Pruitt said. "So, no, I would not agree that it's a primary contributor to the global warming that we see." </TEXT>

 And when they say we didnt vet, well Obama I guess didnt vet, because he was approved at the highest level of security by the Obama administration, Trump added.

 So when he came into our administration, for a short period of time he came in, he was already approved by the Obama administration and he had years left on that approval.
Trump added he respects Flynns past military service and has sympathy for the retired Army lieutenant general.

 I do feel badly for him, he said.  He served the country. He was a [lieutenant] general." </TEXT>

That leaves House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and the White House an incredibly narrow path for passage. The speaker can lose only 22 Republicans on a health-care vote because Democrats have fiercely opposed any attempt to repeal the ACA.

We need some more Republicans to stop falling in line and look out for the people. We need 8 more to step out of line. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes but there is something there, not to mention the Tax Reform benefits Trump greatly. Just because there is nothing showing yet does not mean to give up hope. That is what Trump wants. He wants people to give up and lay down and just succumb to his wishes....we need to resist and fight for the American people AND the country as a whole. 

Even if Trump supporters are not with us, we can see the writing on the wall with the disastrous EPA changes, Tax Reform (Tax break for the rich), and the constant breaking of the Emoluments Clause with his pay to play Mar-a-Lago retreat for him and his swamp.

Keep fighting, because when we give up we lose and we cannot risk a loss for ourselves or the future generations. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  President Obama increase the natioanl debt more than anyone else by far. We might as well try the opposite of whathe did since clearly thst didnt work.

So do you just ignore Donald's golfing every weekend? How about the tax payers paying for Melania  to be away from Trump 24/7? What about the the last "Health Care" repeal that the Republicans tried to pass which was just a tax break for the rich? This is not even throwing in Ivanka and Kushner with all the money they are fleecing while in power.


I doubt you noticed anything since you are a T_D poster and try to do mental gymnastics to justify everything your "God" does.


Don't forget that Donald would make MILLIONS on this Tax break for himself and his appointed swamp. Drain the Swamp...more like Drain America.

edit: Oh, well I knew it was some committee that he did nothing in. Oversight Committee is pretty damn important. It is interesting to note that:

 The chairman of the committee is the only committee chairman in the House with the authority to issue subpoenas without a committee vote.

Does that mean with no chairman that there has to be a vote to ever get a subpoena for information? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Lawyers representing Dow, whose CEO is a close adviser to President Donald Trump, and two other manufacturers of organophosphates sent letters last week to the heads of three of Trump's Cabinet agencies. The companies asked them "to set aside" the results of government studies the companies contend are fundamentally flawed.

I wonder why they think a letter will work when there is all the bad......

 Dow Chemical wrote a $1 million check to help underwrite Trump's inaugural festivities, and its chairman and CEO, Andrew Liveris, heads a White House manufacturing working group.

<TEXT>  In the latest example, the EPA Wednesday called the The Diesel Emission Reduction Program "one of the most cost-effective federal programs," noting $13 in health and economic benefits for every $1 in funding. Also winning recent public praise from the agency: the Energy Star program for appliances and funding to clean up abandoned gasoline storage tanks.

 Each of those programs is on the list of more than 200 the White House targeted for elimination or steep budget cuts, as it seeks to reduce EPAs budget by 31 percent. The budget proposal was turned over to Congress, where appropriators say they will be writing their own version, not approving wholesale the one offered by the president. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Jeff Sessions, had ordered the United States Marshals Service to extend a full protective detail to Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, for as much as $1 million a month

Ok, security for the Department of Education at about $12 million a year.

 Expanded security appears to be in the offing at the Environmental Protection Agency, as well, where administrators have traditionally received door-to-door security. In recent weeks, though, the agency has requested funds to add 10 full-time staff members to form a 24-hour security detail for its current administrator, Scott Pruitt, budget documents show.

Add in the EPA for another $12 mil (guessing), so that is $24 million plus any other security they want to throw at the administration for the dislike and disdain they have received. </TEXT>

<TEXT> New guidelines:

 Federal prosecutors are now required to pursue felony charges against immigrants who commit document fraud or identity theft. Assuming a false identity or aggravated identity fraud will carry a two-year mandatory minimum sentence. Sessions said prosecutors  should also prioritize fraudulent or green card marriages.

So we will be giving the private prisons more slave labor. Does Jeff Sessions have any investments in the prison system? Also, how the fuck can you prove a fraudulent marriage?

 Prosecutors are also required to pursue felony charges against anyone transporting or harboring three or more aliens, Sessions said. We are going to shut down and jail those who have been profiting off this lawlessness.

I guess you are filth if you even talk to or help illegal aliens, you will be jailed for association. Again, which of the Trumpster's have stock in for profit prisons?

 Sessions also said he had directed all U.S. Attorneys offices to prioritize prosecution of assaults on federal law enforcement. If someone dares to assault one of our folks in the line of duty, they will do federal time for it, Sessions said.

Fucking Christ, its not like we as a Nation even trust the police officers to be truthful. Now there will be either MORE recordings or less, depends on the implied threats that police use on people. Not like your word as a citizen stands up to a police officer in court. Their word is always taken as gold even if they are the ones at fault. </TEXT>

But those allegations have not been confirmed by the U.S. government.

<TEXT>  If the election was in two more weeks, Thompson might win, a Kansas Republican strategist told The Hill. Thank God the election is tomorrow.

Let's hope the people of Kansas show up today and prove that strategist wrong. 

Also:

 In a last-minute effort to boost Estess chances, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spent nearly $100,000 for Estes with TV and digital ads. In the TV ad, Republicans cast Thompson as too extreme for Kansas, claiming that he supports late-term abortions.

 Thompsons campaign pushed back, calling the spot outright false and asked a local radio station to pull it. Despite Thompsons protests, an NRCC official said it was completely accurate and still airing, according to the Wichita Eagle. 

GOP motto: Play dirty to win no matter what. </TEXT>

[Flynn, Manafort, Coen and many more?](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/feb/22/all-possible-ties-between-trump-and-russia/) I mean seriously, how delusional are you?

edit: r/randomusername You are an idiot that clearly is trying to shuffle the Russian links under the rug by the Susan Rice story where it was LEGAL for her to ask for name for better context of the stories she was reading.

They voted because they had a candidate that they thought would fight for their rights, the unheard.

In the end, I can only hope it will be like Ulysses S Grant said:

<TEXT> LOL Well maybe we do need the Mean Jesus to come back and show Christians how to be Christ like. 

You know, the Jesus that ransacked the sellers in the temple, the one that taught to love your neighbor as yourself, the one that said "don't look at the speck of dust in your neighbor's eye when you have a plank in your own". Christians today are led more by fear and preachers that teach the old testament instead of what Jesus taught. 

Ugh, sorry...ranting here but having to go to Christian school as a kid and having Bible classes I actually researched things myself instead of believing everything that was told to me. I could go on and on with this but I will leave it with this: Jesus and his teachings do not agree with what Christians are preaching and doing now-a-days.

<TEXT> I will preface this by saying I am a 6'5" bearded male.

Anyone familiar with rentals in Florida is that most of them have a screened in pool. Well, I was out there just chilling and enjoying the weather one night with my 4 other roommates and we noticed a dark spot under the glass patio table so we backed up and turned on the lights. Well that black spot was a Wolf Spider and the light scared it so it took off. 


Did you know the Wolf Spider is one of the fastest spiders in the world? We didn't and were surprised when it took off SUPER FUCKING FAST toward the open door. The roommate that turned on the light, slammed the door shut behind him and it turned skittered past us with blinding speed. All of us screamed like little girls while jumping up on chairs or running around the corner. The roommate that was inside locked the door to make sure we didn't let the spider in, so we had to run out the back in the darkness hoping that a spider did not latch onto our face, legs, and soul.


Needless to say, we did not go back out till the morning and we found the spider at the bottom of the pool. We left it in there all while day, while we went to work, to make sure it was dead before we scooped it out.


TDLR: Wolf spiders can move 2ft in a second; screamed like a girl. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But when you browse r/All and r/Popular(now) and go by rising there is a TD post every other one to 5 in a row and a different sub and then 5 more TD posts. This is even at night when most of the USA is asleep there are posts still pouring in. 

Just doesn't seem possible that 371,756 "Centipedes" can keep a 24/7 post vortex going without some sort of paid help or outside (US) help.

I know I can change it so I don't see their posts but it just seems odd that they can have more posts on rising then any other sub out there. </TEXT>

There was an old couple in front of me, about 65-70 years old I bet, and they lasted only a few minutes of the movie before they walked out in a huff and puff. Might've been the part where Borat is talking about his sister. I don't think they realized it wasn't a documentary.

Good times.

<TEXT> Pedro Alonso Lopez (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_L%C3%B3pez_(serial_killer))

When he was caught he led police to 53 bodies in Ecuador, all girls between nine and twelve years old. Later he was found guilty of murdering 110 girls in Ecuador alone and confessed to 240 more murders of girls in Peru and Colombia. He was released from prison in 1998 and hasn't been seen since.

I like to think he hasn't been seen because the families of the murdered girls killed him.

[Documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPFhpM1CBS4) if anyone wants to see.

Edit: I guess he was picked up for a fresh murder in 2002, I doubt it was just 1 during that time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can hit on the photography, I usually head off to the lakes for the photography. There are quite a few public beaches in Detroit Lakes that you can go to for Sunrise and Sunset pictures over the lake.

Also there is Buffalo State Park about 25min from town and Itasca State Park about 2.5 hours away if you want more "in nature" shots. I really like Buffalo State Park for the hiking and it is a short walk away from the Science Center there. 

Story: Last spring I got to witness the control burn of the prairie grass over at Buffalo State Park and the trail through that area after was very surreal and felt like a foreign world, I would suggest it if they do it again. (Sadly did not have my camera then for any pictures)

Story time: I use to work banquets and there was some event where we needed to cut a case (5lbs) of Habaneros. My coworker had to cut them all and them and once he finished he went to go to the bathroom. He forgot about it and we hear screaming from down a 150ft hall and through a bathroom door. He left for the day, he was mocked relentlessly until someone else did something stupid to replace that. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Under the Federal Law Enforcement Animal Protection Act, anyone convicted of purposely assaulting, maiming, or killing federal law enforcement animals such as police dogs and horses could be fined at least $1,000 and spend up to 10 years in prison.

$1000 fine and up to 10 years in prison if a citizen hurts/kills a police dog and if a police officer uses deadly force on your dog you are the one that is in trouble. How fucked up is that?

<TEXT> In North Dakota you have to factor in windchill also, being a plain and the wind blows constantly. So normal winter is about 0F to -30F (-17C to -34c) BEFORE windchill. Throw in windchill and you are talking about -30F to -60F (-34C to -51C) as a normal temp. You can die in that temp in 10min with just jeans and a t-shirt on...add water and you reduce it to minutes. Water is no joke in cold weather.

AKA: It gets fucking cold here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I seriously dont understand why cops think they can get away with this shit. Not only are you abusing power you are causing the person to lose faith in the system and un-needed financial cost.

To some people, $6,000 in legal fees to protect yourself from an asshole cop is worth violence over. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not Married but use to be a Wedding Photographer

* Make sure to DRINK water, I cant tell you how many times the Bride or Groom (or bridal party) have fainted from being dehydrated on a summer day and the just *BOOM* pass out during the wedding.

* Brides: this is your day AND your husband's, not your mother's, not his mother's, not your family's day, if you want something different put your foot down or else you will remember what you didn't get instead of what you wanted.

* Do not get excessively drunk, it might be something you have done or do but you don't need the family, relatives, and friends to remember you "punching Aunt Judy because she is a bitch"

* Most important: THIS IS JUST 1 DAY, you have THOUSANDS left with your Husband/Wife, remember this is the start to your Chapter  together as a single unit, for better or worse you BOTH will write the chapters of your lives TOGETHER from now on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not talking about that, I am talking about the cops that get caught doing something that is against the law and they get a slap on the wrist. If you are a cop that gets pulled over drinking and driving, most of the time you are just warned and let off. Or the cops that were caught with CP and they get a few months in house arrest (they lost their job so that is a plus). There a thousands of stories where the cop is getting less punishment because he/she is/was a police officer and the citizens that commit the same crimes get the full punishment. That is not true "law enforcement", the law should apply EQUALLY to EVERYONE, not just citizens. 

As soon as cops are punished the same way as the people they are suppose to be protecting, that is when there is true "law enforcement". </TEXT>
