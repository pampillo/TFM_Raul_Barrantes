<TEXT> Doc Rivers is an average coach who lucked into Danny Ainge trading for one of the best five power forwards ever and one of the greatest shooters ever. None of Rivers' teams won a first round series until Garnett showed up in Boston. And while his rosters in Orlando and Boston weren't great, he still had Tracy McGrady and Orlando never won a series with him. 

Is he a good leader? Absolutely and I think he did a nice job with the Sterling stuff last year. 

But he doesn't deserve to be mentioned among the best coaches in the league.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with this. It amazes me how reporters and the average basketball fan will nuke Calipari and Kentucky for ruining college basketball, while giving guys like K, Self, Roy and (back then) Ben Howland a free pass. 

And for what it's worth, I have absolutely no problem with coaches getting one and dones. It's a bad rule that can be exploited for wins. I'd do it. I just wish there was a consistent opinion about it on the guys who do it.  </TEXT>

I think it would have been cool to see those dueling personalities (Angel vs. Devil) last longer than just one episode. Perhaps it could have come after the Season 4 twist. 

I don't know....perhaps make Dexter "The Big Bad" for the finale season if you wanted to go in a completely different direction.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, I think it's unfair to call him a bad tournament coach simply because of the runs in 2008 and 2012, especially 2012. That team had no business getting to the national title game and it did. It won a lot of close games that year in the tournament and coaching wins in close games. I'd call him an average coach, but not a bad coach. 

I think what's hurt KU's teams under Self over the years are a mix of things: Lack of a consistent conference rival (Texas was great in 2008 and Mizzou's 2012 pushed KU), perhaps coming out too tight in a lot of games and luck. 

With luck, look at the VCU loss. VCU was 12-of-25 from three that day. KU was 2-of-21. You're not going to win too many games when your opponent is 30 points better than you from the three-point line. If KU finishes that game 6-of-21 from three, they win. VCU was playing some of the best basketball I've seen. Is that coaching? Maybe a little bit. 

Bradley and Wichita State were cases of really young KU teams going against experienced teams. Outside of size, Wichita State had almost every advantage coming into that game. KU was one of the youngest teams in the country. The Shockers' core had played in a Final Four, finished a regular season undefeated and went to war with a Kentucky team that nearly won the title. 

The Northern Iowa and Bucknell loses were inexcusable. KU was the best team in the country in 2010 and that tournament should have been their's.

I read something on the NBA reddit page about how Popovich takes the pressure off his team by telling them basketball doesn't mean everything. I'd be curious what Self's game-day preparation is like. I do think KU teams have a tendency to come out tight in the tournament. Usually that means the players have the wrong mindset entering the tournament. Maybe that's what Self can work on. 

But overall, I'd take Bill Self over 97 percent of coaches out there. I think KU needs a rival where the game matters more than the standings. Time to schedule Mizzou or Wichita State? I don't know. Maybe hope Texas hires a great coach or Hoiberg stays at Iowa State? </TEXT>

NOT SO RECENTLY: I thought the Spurs were done the year Memphis beat them as a #8 seed. Instead, they made three straight WCF, two conference finals and won a title. You can also argue last year's Spurs team was the best in the Popovich era, though the '07 squad has an argument.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the biggest problems with Alden and basketball coaches is that he's a micro-manager of everything. It scared off some of the better candidates during his last two hirings. 

I wasn't a big fan of Haith and I'm not sure he deserved an extension. 

But if you let Haith leave, you must do better than a Division 2 head coach who built his D2 program through transfers, JUCOs, ect. He's never proven to develop talent from the freshman level. He was Norm's lead assistant during some of the bad years in the mid-to-late 1990's. He absolutely did not deserve the job and the fact some Mizzou fans think he did a good job this year is a good example why Mizzou's never made a Final Four.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mike Alden deserves most of the blame for this. The original sin, of course, was hiring Quin Snyder over Bill Self and John Calpari. 

Then, there was his brilliant decision to hire Mike Anderson over Bob Huggins. Now, I love Mike Anderson and I hope he does really well at Arkansas. But it was no secret Huggins was putting together a great recruiting class behind the scenes. If Mizzou hires Huggy, things are better. 

After Mike Anderson goes home, he pulls Frank Haith out of nowhere, when Gregg Marshall and a few others wanted the job. This was before Marshall went to the Final Four, but it was clear he was building something at Wichita State. 

Finally, he hires Kim Anderson, a Division 2 coach who was NEVER even a candidate at a school like Missouri State, UMKC and other area small Division 1 schools in the Midwest. The only reason he was hired was because he was a Tiger alum. Fact. Alden hired Kim Anderson and threw a bone to the older fan base and donors who are bigger Norm Stewart fans than Mizzou fans. Ben Howland, Brad Underwood and Chris Mack would have taken that job, from what someone close to the Board of Trustees told me. Yet, they hired a True Son Division 2 head coach. 

I wish Mizzou would fire Alden before his retirement becomes official. He murdered the basketball program.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I loved Captain America: The Winter Soldier, I wish there would have been more to how Steve adapted to 2010-14. I think there could have been some nice realization that while some things changed for the worse in Steve's eyes (less patriotism, less connection between individuals), things also improved for the better - less racism, more accepting population to differences. 

I know it may have added more time to the movie, but I think it would have been great to show him struggling with the time change, rather than just putting it off as a funny line with the checklist early in the movie.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't buy that Tattoo gate was orchestrated, but I do think there was communication between the Meyer and Ohio State camps during that scandal. Between Meyer's wishy-washy ending in Florida when he retired twice and the timing of how it all went down, I wouldn't be surprised if there was a wink and a nod type of deal between the two. It's amazing how those heart problems and migraines went away. Also, in terms of Ohio State having an interim head coach the year between Tressel and Meyer, I could see Meyer wanting to take a year off to let the NCAA settle with Ohio State. 

And for what it's worth, I don't blame Ohio State at all if something like this happened. Urban Meyer is one of the two best coaches of the past 20 years and if you get a chance to land him, do it.  </TEXT>

Lithgow was outstanding in Season 4 and the ending was the most shocking TV moment I've seen, but there were some flaws to that season that are often overlooked because of how good of a villain Trinity was.  </TEXT>

The one "what if" scenario I think about is if Orlando kept Chris Webber instead of trading him for Penny. Not sure if they overtake MJ's Bulls, but Shaq+Webber would have been very interesting.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Where do I start? 

First, our coach is calling out his players because of the bad manners they are displaying. He's punishing kids for wearing hats while eating. He called out two players by name for showing bad "posture" during a post-game interview session and one of his priorities is how they enunciate words. 

Missouri basketball: First in manners, last in the SEC. 

Sadly, a lot of our fan base is eating this up because they are bigger fans of Norm Stewart than they are Missouri basketball. Some Mizzou fans would be perfectly fine running out five white kids from rural Missourah each night, as long as they "hustled" all the time. 

Missouri fans have accepted sucking for a long time. The deification of Norm Stewart/Kim Anderson are great examples. Norm would be the sixth best coach in the history of Kansas Jayhawks basketball. He'd be a footnote there.

<TEXT> How any prominent loss from an SEC team means it's overrated, never mind the fact the conference still brings in the most top recruits and produces the most NFL talent most years. The amount of times fans brought up Oklahoma beating Alabama and Indiana beating Mizzou was absurd. The Mizzou loss was terrible, but it was not a reflection of the conference's 13 other teams.

<TEXT> ELEPHANT #1: The prospect of the Raiders overspending and signing bad contracts with players. Having $50-60 million in cap-room is good if you know what to do with it. However, it's also an invitation to giving away money for guys who may not be in their prime any more. As much as Marshawn Lynch in a Raiders jersey appeals to me, the fact that's nearly 30 also scares me. A team like the Raiders has to pay a little bit more for a quality free agent due to how bad they have been lately. But hopefully they do not break the bank. 

ELEPHANT #2: The fact Jim Harbaugh and other quality head coaching candidates rejected the Raiders. If the rumored contract offer for Harbaugh is true. he left a ton of money on the table. The Raiders have not had a quality head coach since Jon Gruden.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nope. I still think it sucks. I'd understand the idea of passing the ball if you didn't have one timeout left. You run on second down and if you don't get in, call timeout. Pass on third down and on a potential fourth down, you have the Patriots playing the ultimate guessing game. 

It's no guarantee Seattle gets in from there - see the Packers/Seahawks game - but your best player needs to touch the ball at least once in that final stretch of plays. Add in the fact Lynch almost got in from the 6 and it's even bigger no-brainer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Brady is the best of this generation/era for sure. He will be unless Aaron Rodgers can get two or three more rings. 

All-time, I still prefer Joe Montana. This is no criticism of Brady, but Montana played in an era where defensive lineman could hit the quarterback as hard as they wanted. Montana played in an era where defensive backs could be physical with wide receivers. Rod Woodson once said Dan Marino would throw for 100,000 yards in this era with these rules. 

I don't like the idea of rings validating a player. In my eyes, Tom Brady's legacy would not have changed one bit if the Pats lost tonight. But for those who want to do rings, Montana was 4-0 in the Super Bowl and never threw an interception. Brady has now thrown four and it took him three attempts to win ring #4. Montana, while having great talent at the end of his tenure in San Francisco, won his first two Super Bowls without Jerry Rice. If you look back at his first Super Bowl team, it was not exactly stacked. 

Montana and Brady both benefited from great coaches, so that part of the debate is out the window in my opinion. 

I'll take Montana, but Brady definitely deserves to be at the table in this debate. It's down to those two, in my opinion, and you cannot go wrong with either. I just prefer the guy who played in a tougher era for quarterbacks. But I think those who say this debate is definitely over are incorrect. Both sides have great arguments and the answer lies in what you value more.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Both defenses stepped up for sure, especially Seattle's for keeping Green Bay out of the end-zone. I think Seattle beats Green Bay at least 7 out of 10 times if they play on a neutral field considering the Hawks played a terrible, terrible game on offense and still won.

But the narrative is rightfully placed on Green Bay's feet. I cannot recall a championship game where one team or coach missed so many opportunities. Green Bay kicks a field goal two times after a drive stalled inside the two. Most coaches go for it at least once. A Green Bay defender slides and gives up a potential "pick 6" or at least better field position. Aaron Rodgers throws two bad interceptions, including one to Richard Sherman in the end-zone. Bad decision. The onside kick. The screw-up on the two-point possession. The play-calling late in the game. Green Bay's defensive meltdown late in the 4th quarter and early overtime. 

I think Seattle is the better team and they're my pick two weeks from now, but Green Bay choked. Sorry. This is a game they had to win based on Wilson's 4 interceptions. But Mike McCarthy had his "Grady Little Game" on Sunday. If McCarthy did not win a ring already, he may have been fired today.  </TEXT>

Not taking away from Oregon's staff, but I think Meyer will coach a terrific game. My gut opinion is he'll commit to the run, control the line of scrimmage and grind it out. I think this ends up similar to the first UA/UO game and it's a lower scoring game than most think. 

Ohio State 28, Oregon 24.  </TEXT>

That said, Aaron Rodgers was phenomenal in the second half. It shouldn't take away from the game he had the Packers would have had 3 minutes left to respond.  </TEXT>

They were not making fun of rape or the woman who was raped. They were taunting Jameis Winston and made fun of one of the single dumbest chants in sports. I thought it was funny and clever. Sue me. 

Plus, a side bonus: It indirectly brought attention to the case and how the Tallahassee Police Department screwed up the investigation. That was not the reason they did it, but it brought the subject back up and it's worthy to discuss.

<TEXT> A wild thought I had....one I doubt would actually happen, but worth bringing up. 

How about the other Harbaugh? Lost in the whole Ray Rice scandal was apparently a rift developing between the Ravens front office and the Harbaugh in terms of how to handle the Rice situation. The Ravens and John Harbaugh denied, of course. 

But if the Raiders are willing to fork over $9 million to Jim Harbaugh, why not John Harbaugh? He's won a Super Bowl championship and outside of one year, he's made the playoffs every season he's coached. Even though they made the playoffs, that team is not as good as it was just a few years. No Ray Lewis. I think Flacco has proven to be unworthy of that contract. 

If he comes to Oakland, he'd have a ton of cap space to work with. Derek Carr is young and performed well in stretches during his rookie season. There's young talent and some veterans on that defense. 

I doubt it happens....but why not throw the kitchen sink at John? There'd be compensation for him in the form of picks, but as long as it's not the #1 pick, let's consider it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think for one year, it's very possible. When Bill Callahan took over the Raiders team, the Raiders improved and made it to the Super Bowl. I think this situation is very similar to the Gruden/Al Davis fallout. That fallout distracted the Raiders during the '01 season. I think the same thing happened this year to you guys. If you hire the right coach, I would not be surprised at all to see the 49ers get back to the postseason. 

However, my concern is the long-term ramifications of this move. Like Harbaugh, Gruden took over a bad situation and made it well with a combination of veterans and younger players. After that one great season under Callahan, the bottom fell out quickly and the Raiders haven't been back since. 

Now, Al was losing it in his final years, so that contributed to the downfall. But the 49ers better have a plan and bring in a credible coach. Josh McDaniels does not fit that bill.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They'll only jump recruiting wise. I think that's a given with Harbaugh's track record and what Michigan football is about. 

What I'm curious about is the potential domino effect this has on the quality of conferences. I've long believed the single biggest reason the SEC became what it was is coaching. This started with Steve Spurrier at Florida, then picked up when Nick Saban was hired at LSU, Urban Meyer going to Florida, Mark Richt at Georgia (I know he hasn't won it all, but still a great record), Les Miles to LSU, Saban to 'Bama, ect. The SEC is what it is because of coaching. I don't necessarily buy the "warm weather means everything" argument. I think Nick Saban would win if he coached college football in New York City, Iowa, Idaho, ect. Oregon, Ohio State, Wisconsin and Missouri have all had 12-win seasons the past decade and they're in the cold. It's about coaching and vision of a program. 

I think the Big 10 could be back if Michigan hires Harbaugh. Ohio State with Urban Meyer is very, very good. I like James Franklin to turn Penn State around down the road. Mark Dantonio has Michigan State playing great football. I actually think Mike Riley could be better than many think at Nebraska. Kill's doing some very nice things at Minnesota. I also think Harbaugh and Meyer will force programs to up their games and make big time hires. I could see Iowa making a run at Bielema, for example, in the next few years. Saban's presence in the SEC made the other schools ante to sign coaches and to keep them. 

If Harbaugh lands at Michigan, the Big 10 profile will benefit in a big way. It'll still take a while to overtake the SEC, but the gap would close considerably with Harbaugh at Michigan. 

That, and the Ohio State-Michigan-Michigan State triumvirate will make for some awesome rivalries and recruiting battles.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Find a way to get Amare Cooper. Draft analysts are saying he's the best wide receiver to come out since Megatron. 

2. Land Jim Harbaugh. It sounds like Harbaugh's going to Michigan, but I still have this little doubt in my head he's using Michigan as a way to get out of San Francisco without a trade. 

3. Land one more pass rusher. This helps Mack as well. 

4. Some luck. It's rare to go from three wins to 11 or 12. I think a proven coach, a good coaching staff and a wide out can get this team to 6-8 wins. By luck, perhaps Peyton Manning retires?  </TEXT>

But they really should have went the True Detective route when it comes to doing eight episodes. Eight would have been perfect. I would have liked to see more with Neil and what his journey was like. Use one episode on Charlie and flashbacks. I loved the idea of what they were doing in remembering Charlie. I also love the Northwestern flashback and how that worked out. I liked the episode itself - I just didn't like that it was the final episode of the show. It would have been a great next to last episode.

I'm with you though.

<TEXT> I actually think KU isn't that big of a long-shot compared to what some people think. I think he's like Larry Brown - he likes to take over dumpster fire situations, build them up and win. He's done it three times and he'd do it again. 

If I was betting man, I think he's either coaching the Raiders or KU next year.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We'll see. If Alabama wins tomorrow as they should, Bama will be a big favorite. 

It reminds me of the set-up of the 1996 Big 12 title game. Nebraska, currently in a dynasty, played a two-loss Texas team that year that won a ton of ugly games to win a weak division. Texas had no pressure on them in the game and played with house money. 

We know what happened. 

Now, I think Bama's clearly a better team. But Any Given Saturday.  </TEXT>

Derek Carr has had a good season considering the overall season the team has had. This year's draft class is looking solid and the Raiders should have money to spend next year. 

Let's use these final six games to play younger guys and get them reps for next year.

<TEXT> I live in Kansas City, so I've seen a lot of Chiefs games this season. 

The keys:

- Make Alex Smith beat you. Alex Smith is a good quarterback, but the Chiefs have been at their best when Jamaal Charles and Knile Davis have carried the team on offense. On top of that, the Chiefs don't have any deep threats. Contain Charles and the rushing attack and the Raiders have a puncher's chance. I think Alex Smith is capable of putting the Chiefs on his back (he did in the playoffs last year), but make him do it. 

- No turnovers. Last year, the Raiders turned the ball over seven times against the Chiefs. I think this Chiefs team is a lot better than last year's version. That's not gonna cut it against a playoff team. They've also had numerous, killer turnovers over the years against the Chiefs when they've played on the west coast. 

- Special teams. The Chiefs have been very solid on special teams returns this season. De'Anthony Thomas is due to break one. Let's hope it's not against the Raiders. To win, the Raiders need to win the field advantage battle. 

- Find ways to get to Smith. The two games Smith has really struggled in this year happened because the defense got to him big time. Whether it's winning the battles up front or calling creative blitz schemes, rattle him and knock the Chiefs' offense off rhythm. They don't have sexy stats, but the offense is efficient.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a Mizzou fan, I don't know where to start. 

Actually, yes I do. 

What if Mizzou hired Bill Self as head coach in 1999 instead of Quin Snyder? The three finalists for that job were Self, Snyder and some guy named John Calipari, who recently got fired from the NBA. Calipari pulled out of consideration at the last minute. 

So many interesting parts to this:

1. Does Mizzou become the top program in the Big 12? Self's track record against Roy Williams makes me think it was possible. Self recruited a lot of guys to Illinois and Mizzou is a pretty similar program in terms of geography. 

2. Who does Illinois hire in 2000? Does Illinois even sniff the Final Four without Self bringing in that talent? Do they somehow find a better coach who stays there for years and years? What if's go both ways. 

3. Who does KU hire in 2003? Help me out here KU fans, but wasn't Self the slam dunk top candidate? Do they find someone who continues to win like Roy did? Do they hire a Matt Doherty/Steve Lavin type that sends that program into the ground? 

4. Where is Self coaching today? While I'm a diehard Mizzou fan, I'm a realist and Mizzou certainly would not be Self's last coaching job. Does he take the Oklahoma State job when Sutton retires? Does he take over at Kentucky or Indiana at some point? Or, oddly enough, maybe North Carolina if Self took Mizzou to a Final Four before 2003? He said in his book that he wouldn't have left for KU if he was offered the job had he been Mizzou's coach. I could maybe see him pull a Pitino and take an NBA job and later be hired by KU if he failed in the NBA. But he certainly would not have replaced Roy. 

I honestly think this is the biggest "what if" of the past 15 years in college basketball consider Self's success at Illinois and KU.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kim Anderson

Strength 1: He has a history of winning. Is it in D1? Nope. But he's won a national title and he's won big games at his level. This suggests that he knows basketball and can coach well. That doesn't mean Mizzou will win a title or anything like that, but he has a pedigree of success. 

Strength 2: I think his teams will be a lot smarter than those Frank Haith had. So I think he'll bring some fundamentals back to this team. 

Weakness 1: No D1 experience. Bo Ryan demonstrated that you can go from one level to the next and do well. Still, it's a HUGE question mark and it's why I wasn't so excited about the hiring. 

Weakness 2: I won't say this is a weakness necessarily, but can he recruit enough talent to compete against Kentucky, Florida, Arkansas, ect.? Haith was a good recruiter. Can Anderson and his staff bring in some talent?

_____

Mike Anderson (I'll pick Arkansas as Mizzou's SEC rival in basketball)

Strength 1: Defense. When his team has the right talent, but they can create havoc on defense. 

Strength 2: He's good at stabilizing a program. I know most Mizzou fans don't like him now, but he took over a dumpster fire from Quin Snyder. Anderson did a nice job at making Mizzou respectable again and by all indications, he's a class act and he can recruit well. He's a good "Face of the Program" type and I think Arkansas will get good again. 

Weakness 1: He's stubborn as hell. I loved the guy, but if he's coaching against a team with better athletes, he gets rolled all the time and will not adjust from his system. See what Bill Self and KU did to him most years when Mike as Mizzou. He's not great at adjusting his defense.

Weakness 2: His half court offenses were average to below average most years at Mizzou and whenever I watch Arkansas play, they seem to struggle there too.  

That said, I still respect the job he did at Mizzou and thankful he coached there. Now Kim Anderson has to clean up a bit from the Haith Era . </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a sneaky suspicion Sanchez will do well. He helped take the Jets to two straight AFC Championship games. His quarterback rating in the playoffs is a very respectable 94.0. He outplayed Tom Brady in the Division Playoff Round. I also think Chip Kelly is someone who's very good at getting the best out of his offensive talent. He's familiar with Sanchez since both were in the Pac 10. 

If you were to compare situations, I'd take the Eagles over the Cowboys when it comes to back-up quarterbacks. Philly will be OK I think.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to give one Mizzou related one and one CFB related:

- For Mizzou, last year's game against South Carolina. Even with the loss in the SECG, they're probably going to a BCS bowl if they finished the regular season undefeated. That was a kick in the balls loss. Mizzou had a handful of chances to put that game away and it failed. Credit to Connor Shaw's gutsy performance. 

- General, I'll say K-State losing to Texas A M in the 1998 Big 12 championship game. K-State's a rival, but even I felt sick for them after that game. A M was down 15 late and somehow came back. If K-State wins that game, I think they handle Tennessee in the national title game and Bill Snyder goes from worst to first.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> RAIDERS RELATED: What if the alleged trade that brings John Elway to the Raiders in 1983 wasn't allegedly blocked by Pete Rozell? Are the Raiders still in LA? How about a backfield of Elway and Marcus Allen? Or later, Bo Jackson? Do the Raiders win two more titles in the 1980's or early 1990's? What happens to the Broncos? Elway was in my mind the greatest quarterback ever. Forget the Tuck Rule: That's a huge WHAT IF for the Raiders.

REST OF THE LEAGUE: What if Jimmy Johnson and Jerry Jones would have worked out their issues and stayed together with the Cowboys? I know Barry Switzer won the Super Bowl a few years later with that team, but I think that team wins five or six Super Bowls in the 1990's if Jimmy was still there. Along with being a better coach, I think Jimmy would have done a great job in drafting and trading for talent to keep that team going a few extra years.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Disappointed they didn't win, but I'm not in pain over the series loss. The Royals ran into literally the best pitcher in World Series history and settled on one of the best defensive plays in Game 7 history. 

It's not like the series was decided on a Bill Buckner play. The bullpen didn't blow a lead in Game 7. There was no choke job. There was no weird fluky stuff like Steve Bartman or Bucky Dent. 

The Giants were a pinch better than the Royals. If they played 10 times, I think they'd split them. Unfortunately, there are only seven games and the team with the best pitcher won. 

I can't lose too much sleep over this loss.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obviously no guarantee, but here's what I do:

1. Let Shields and Butler walk. I appreciate James Shields and what he did to help transform the culture. But the Royals are a small market team and I wouldn't give a 33-year-old pitcher a $100 million deal. I wish him well, but the Royals need to be thrifty with the $30 million they'll have to spend. Plus, I think a healthy Duffy and a more experienced Ventura would help fill the gap. Add in Vargas and Guthrie and you have most of the starting rotation from this year.

2. Make a run at a right fielder. They've mentioned Torii Hunter, but I'd prefer Michael Cuddyer. He's hit reasonably well at The K, averaging .280 with 13 homers in 58 games. Cuddyer wouldn't be a big, big bat. But he'd be a nice position upgrade. And I'd prefer him over Hunter due to age. 

3. Look for another starter somewhere. Maybe a Brandon McCarthy? Don't know. 

4. Look for a decent back-up catcher. Salvy Perez needs a reliable back-up after this year. 

I know there's buzz about trading one of the members of the HYDRA bullpen, but I'd wait for the trade deadline. If the Royals are struggling badly, then swing a deal. However, that bullpen is too good to break-up until it needs to be. It needs to be a Godfather like offer to move any of them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even as a Royals fan, I definitely understand your point. However, I believe both the Giants and the Royals were built for the postseason and deserved to be there in the end. 

Bumgardner is literally the best World Series pitcher ever and a short-game series allows the Giants to use him more. The Royals' bullpen this year was the most dominant baseball has seen in a long time. It almost was enough to win the World Series. 

The postseason allows teams to shorten their pitching staffs, meaning the fourth and fifth best pitchers of the staff don't start unless there are injuries. I imagine teams with a great regular season record had fun when teams threw out their fourth or fifth best starters. 

Plus, the Royals won 102 games in 1977 and failed to make the World Series. They won 97 games in 1980 and failed to win the World Series. Weird things happen in October and I'm not apologizing that the Royals made it in the series.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. I disagree with the decision to send Gordon. He's out by 20 feet if the third base coach sends him. I do think Gordon scores if he hustles, but it's hard to blame him too much.

2. Perez had bad swings all year. See the Wild Card game. Even his game winning hit was ugly. I don't think him getting hit was a factor in the final result.

3. Hard to know. You could make an argument either way about the Royals making a comeback. Either way, Bochy made the right and even if the Royals tied it, it was the right call.

My big what if of Game 7 is the double play. If the Royals took the lead, I think they win. My big what if of the series is if Duffy was fully healthy. The Giants were missing Cain, so it balanced. But Duffy was the best starter ERA wise this year and perhaps Game 4 or Game 7 goes differently. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before it started, the two World Series doppelgangers I thought this series could turn out like is the 2003 World Series or the 2007 World Series. 

The 2003 World Series, like this one, featured a previous world championship team (Yankees, Giants) and a "What the hell" team (Marlins, Royals) that ended with the younger and unexpected team winning the title. I know there wasn't a Bartman situation for the Royals, but that Marlins team had a lot of comeback wins, late-inning victories, timely hitting, great defense and a couple fluky breaks like this Royals team has. 

The 2007 World Series had a similar storyline, except this time the Cinderella was overwhelmed by the more experienced and better team. Admittedly, I had a flashback to the 2007 World Series after Game 1. 

There's still a long way to go. The way this postseason has gone, I wouldn't be surprised by any outcome at this point.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, let me say that behind the Kansas City Royals, Missouri basketball is my favorite team. I like them more than Mizzou's football team even with Pinkel's successful 15 years. 

I agree with you about the arena. I loathe that place. I don't get how Mizzou's record has been so great there the past five years. There's little energy in that building and I miss Hearnes. 

That said, here's mine: The "Norm Stewart was God" segment of the fan base. Norm is a genuinely nice man and I'm thankful for his time. But some fans think he was the greatest coach ever. Let the record show he never made the Final Four and he had his share of tournament flame outs. Norm would be the fifth best coach at KU with that record. 

While I'm warming up to the Kim Anderson hire, the fact he was #1 on so many fans' lists (at least here in Kansas City) was depressing, especially with Howland, Gregg Marshall, ect. out there. 

Remember Norm fondly. He had a good run at Mizzou. But he wasn't John Wooden or Bear Bryant. Let's not look back to the past when we're looking to the future. I wish Kim Anderson well, but if he wasn't a Norm Guy, he doesn't get that job.

<TEXT> The most underrated important play of the game was the wild pitch by Hunter Strickland. Salvy had two weak swings before the wild pitch, which moved the runners over to second and third. I think Perez was afraid of hitting into a double play and after the DP was taken out, he had a strong swing on the next play. 

That pitch also started the unraveling of Strickland and was huge.  </TEXT>

There were possible scenarios for him to defeat England and later the Soviet Union. If the Nazis don't shift the bombing efforts to London, they could have wiped the Royal Air Force. Had Hitler's race views prevented the Germans from arming and welcoming the Eastern Europeans who initially viewed the Germans as liberators from Stalin, perhaps they could have knocked out the Soviets. 

There was no possible way Nazi Germany could have defeated the United States, Great Britain AND the Soviet Union. America's economy was a war machine by 1945 and its production dwarfed anything Germany could have produced even at its peak.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Respectfully disagree. Joe Montana or John Elway were better. They played in an era where defenses were allowed to be physical with wide receivers, allowed to hit the QB at full speed and both played outside of a dome and when most stadiums had grass. 

Peyton's a great quarterback for sure, but he's played in the most friendly era when it comes to quarterbacks. I'd take Montana, Elway and even Dan Marino before him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who takes part in a lot of "Pick'Em" contests and occasionally makes small wagers on CFB games, I dislike Clemson and Virginia Tech because they are my betting kryptonite. No matter how hard I study trends or look at the match-ups in a toss-up game involving one of the two teams, I lose. It feels like my all-time picking record with them is 3-97. 

Just last year, I picked Georgia to beat Clemson, then picked Clemson to beat Florida State and then picked Ohio State to beat Clemson. 0 for fucking 3. I picked Clemson to beat Florida State this year and they meltdown and choke. Clemson upsetting LSU a few years ago in a bowl game hurt my chances at winning a Bowl Pick'Em I was in. 

The best way to become a millionaire is to ask me who I'm picking in a game involving those two teams and bet the opposite.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep. He's got a script and he sticks to it. That's both good and bad depending on what type of situation he has. His handling of pitchers during the season drove me nuts, particularly with bringing Aaron Crow in during in a crucial game against the Red Sox late in the season. Some of his substitution moves when it came to pinch hitters were mistakes too. All managers make bad moves, but Yost's come in the most important times. He's lucky the Royals came back in the Wild Card game.

The over reliance on bunting bothers me too, but to his credit, it's worked in the postseason. I thought Moose bunting in the 9th inning of Game 2 in the ALCS was a terrible mistake. It turned into two runs. The buttons he's pushed --- even the wrong ones --- have worked since the Wild Card debacle. 

That said, sometimes a manager looks smarter depending on the team he has. Joe Torre lost a ton of games with the Mets and the Cardinals, only to later win four World Series with the Yankees.  </TEXT>

Either way, you'll have a match-up of a team looking to snap a looooong World Series drought vs. a team that's won a couple the past decade. The Giants are also looking to become a dynasty and three titles in five years would qualify them for that. 

Also, if the Royals get the Giants, they'd have a chance to eliminate a third California team from the playoffs. I'm guessing that's never been done.   </TEXT>

Should they? I don't know. Gruden didn't do a good job with full control after winning the Super Bowl with Dungy's roster. I love the guy, but full control rarely works in the NFL. I think Andy Reid and the job he's done in Kansas City the past two years is proof that when a coach only coaches, that's good. I think that's what doomed him in Philly.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've went back and forth, but I'm leaning towards "work" for these reasons: 

1. Everyone benefited. Bret got the big contract from WCW and had the best entrance into WCW possible. He was the most famous athlete in the world. Shawn Michaels got heel heat you can't buy and the title. Vince McMahon got more attention to his company and Bret's exit opened the door for Steve Austin to rise and for "Mr. McMahon" to become a great heel. Heck, even the ref is famous because of it. It was the perfect end for Bret Hart's "Hitman" character. 

2. Vince had MANY opportunities to take the belt off Bret. Also, if I remember the timeline right, the contract negotiations were going on even before Bret won the belt that year. Why put the belt on him in the first place? Also, why not take the belt off of him before Survivor Series? Vince is too smart of a guy in my opinion to get himself into a jam like this, especially after the fiasco of the female wrestler who trashed his belt on Nitro. 

3. The fact Owen stayed. I know Bulldog left, but if someone legitimately did that to my brother, it would be tough for me to work for Vince. 

4. For years, Vince refused to let outside cameramen take photos around the ring. Somehow he decides to let a documentary film company go backstage, interview wrestlers, ect.? Come on. 

5. The fact multiple wrestlers, including Lawler, Kevin Nash and others, suggest it's a work is telling to me. Lawler was part of the greatest storyline ever with Andy Kauffman and they kept that secret for 20 years. 

I see both sides of the argument, but those are my five reasons why.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why is it that society gets more angry at words than actions?

For example: The Minnesota Vikings suspended its special teams coach for a dumb anti-gay remark. The coach was an ass and he needed to be condemned. However, Adrian Peterson was deactivated for one game for leaving permanent scarring on two young children.

Additionally, Richie Incognito received a worse punishment for his actions. Again, he was wrong and I do not feel bad about him not having a team. 

It reminds me of how Donald Sterling was only forced to give up his team after he told his girlfriend to not hang around with black guys, rather than giving up the team after he was proven to have descriminated against minorities.

Can we punish violence and actual actions more than words? </TEXT>

<TEXT> A chance? Of course. Manhattan is a sneaky tough place to play. K-State has beaten some great teams there, including a USC team that would win the Orange Bowl. You can't count out Bill Snyder. 

However, the reason I like Auburn is because I think they have the talent advantage and a great coach. I'm a big drinker of the Malzahn Kool Aid and Snyder doesn't have a big coaching advantage over him compared to Mack Brown or other guys in the nation. 

Plus, K-State has question marks on defense from what I saw in the Iowa State game. They had a pretty solid second half, so maybe they have momentum. 

I think it's a game through three quarters, but I like Auburn to win 42-27.  </TEXT>

1. I would have used Miguel's death as the beginning point to spark LaGuerta's belief about Dexter being a killer. Miguel and her were friends and knew each other. This makes Season 3, in my opinion one of the weakest seasons, more important. Plus, one of the biggest flaws of the show was connecting the seasons together IMO. No need to re-write Season 3, but at least mention the death in Season 7 or something. 

2. I would have kept one of these three people alive: Brian, Trinity or Doakes. Let's say one of them escapes. Then, bring him back for a final showdown of sorts in Season 8. Perhaps the final scene of Season 7 alludes to them being back? How about Trinity or Brian spying Dexter and Deb as they're walking away at the New Year's Party? Another big flaw of Dexter, particularly in Season 8, was introducing too many new characters. For the final season, bring one of the best villains back.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree on Miles, but I wouldn't rule out Harbaugh for a few reasons:

1. He doesn't get along with his general manager in San Francisco. There's also reports that some of his players don't like him. If San Francisco has a disappointing season, I could see him trying to bail. 

2. $$$$$$$$. If Michigan wants to resurrect its football program, they may throw a blank check at Harbaugh. 

3. I think his attitude and style is more appealing for a group of 18-22 year olds than professional players. Don't get me wrong ---- I think he's a GREAT coach and his record in the NFL shows that. However, I just think he's a better fit at the college level and if there's one college job that can get him to leave the NFL, it's Michigan. 

Do I think Harbaugh goes there? Probably not. But I wouldn't rule it out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the ship has sailed on Miles to Michigan. Similar to Saban and Texas, I think Miles is closer to retirement and I think it's too late for him to make a move to Michigan and rebuild that program. 

I don't think Harbaugh is as much of a long shot as many think. There's a lot of buzz that he doesn't get along with the ownership and general manager in San Francisco. A report came out today that he's lost the lockerroom. While I'm sure some of this is probably not true, I do think where there's smoke, there's fire. If Michigan loses three or four more games, I could see them throwing a blank check at Harbaugh. 

Plus, I think Harbaugh is more of a college coach than NFL coach even though he's been very successful so far in the NFL.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. NFC East: It's the only division in the NFL that I can see any of the teams winning this year. My gut feeling is Philadelphia takes it, but I would not be surprised at all if the Giants, Cowboys or Redskins win it. 

2. AFC North: I expect rebound seasons for the Steelers and Ravens. I still think Cincinnati is a threat to win the division again. I also think Cleveland will be improved and the Manziel drama will be interesting. 

3. NFC West: I would have had this my number two until Bradford got hurt. I still think it'll be the best division, but I think there's a wider gap between first and fourth.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My handful of changes to Dexter post-season 4:

- Merge the Lumen and Hannah characters into one. Not a biggy, but I think this series suffered from an overabundance of characters. Cut one of them out. Even if you have Lumen leave in Season 5, you can always bring her back. 

- Midway through Season 5, have Dexter commit a sloppy kill that leads to suspicion from Miami metro. Whether it's a blood-slide or any other piece of evidence that could link him, do it. As Season 5 moves on, LaGuerta and Deb slowly become suspicious, both remembering that Miguel Prado and Dexter were great friends. Make Miguel's murder comeback and haunt Dexter. 

- Deb catches Dexter/Lumen at the end of Season 5. That's the final scene of the season. 

- Merge Seasons 6 and 7 into one final sixth season. The plots of Season 6 and Season 8 really did not matter towards the end game. Season 7 was a strong season even with its flaws. In the first half of Season 6, have one final bad guy that's eliminated. Save the second half for a manhunt of Dexter that results in a final solution to the show.  </TEXT>

It's a shame many fans in the future will look back and say "how did they win the title?" since they didn't have a superstar. 

The '11 Mavericks and '04 Pistons were similar teams. Veterans all over, great coaching and multiple guys who were not afraid to take the big shots. 

Neither team deserves to be called a "weak champion." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I still watched this show for its entire run. I'm not someone who can "give up" a show when I'm three to four seasons in. 

But I think this show jumped the shark when it went from a vampire/human show to a monster show. I think four or even five seasons of solely vampire stuff could have worked. Sometimes you go overboard and try to create a lot of things. True Blood failed in later years because it put quantity over quality, in my opinion. 

In regards to the final, I thought they were setting up the Bill human conversion. There were two hints that it was happening and instead, they killed him off.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Season or just final episode?

- Season: Without writing too much about it, I would pick Season 8 right up where Season 7 left off. Investigation of LaGuerta's crime scene. Investigation continues and by the fourth or fifth episode, Miami metro figures out Dexter's secrets and a manhunt begins. The series ends with Deb killing Dexter. Not too detailed. I would not introduce one new character this season. No new bad guy. It's Miami metro/Deb vs. Dexter. I know they did that in Season 2, but that's the only way you could have ended it. 

- Just the final episode: I'd keep Deb alive. No Lumberjack madness. Dexter doesn't ditch his son with a woman who's a serial killer herself. One scene I add for sure is some type of montage of members of Miami metro finding out about Dexter being a killer. Even if the current final episode had at least confirmation Miami metro figured it out, it would have ended on a better note for me personally.  </TEXT>

That was Jon Gruden's last game as the Raiders head coach. It's hard to say what happens if the Raiders win that game. But since it's fake, let's say they win the Super Bowl.

<TEXT> How I did it:

- I started walking two miles a day, hell or high water. Walking three straight weeks gets you into an exercise habit. After walking for three months and losing 50 pounds, I started doing TaeBo. After a year with TaeBo, I started doing Insanity, where I lost 100 pounds in seven months. Bottom line: Start slow, especially if you weighed A LOT like I did. Gradually increase the stress of your workout. I did not go to the gym once.

- I gave up liquid calories and stuck to water, tea and unfortunately, Diet Mountain Dew. Liquid calories pile up quickly.

- Keep track of your calories. Moderation is important. You can cheat here or there....but you can't go overboard.

- Find a way to keep your accountable. I used Facebook and my 1,000 plus friends. I celebrated milestones. I noted when I failed. Compliments, encouragement and help from friends goes a long, long way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I liked Season 7. It wasn't great, but I liked the new characters introduced and the season finale was a pretty great episode filled with drama. 

My big beefs with Season 8 were the following:

- The LaGuerta murder never being addressed. This should have kick-started the final season. Instead, we get a bench.

- Too many new characters in the final season. To me a final season needs to develop core characters even more and bring them towards an ending. This....did not happen. I thought Matthews should have played the role the female doctor. Also, substitute Bautista and Quinn for Elway and the U.S. Marshall. Those two changes would have been a major improvement. 

- The finale to me wasn't as bad. It was the episodes leading up to it. Season 8 never felt like the final season. That's a problem! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not all. Most people I know think Cleveland should keep Wiggins. 

I've went back and forth on this, but I'd make the trade for Love. Wiggins is unproven. Love, while he has flaws, is a Top 10-12 player in the NBA. He's only 25, so it's not like they're trading for an aging star and mortgaging the future. 

Plus, with all the discussion about how the Big 3 were flawed and how tying up so much salary into three guys could hurt, the Heat DID win two titles and make four Finals. If Cleveland wins two titles in the next year, it's worth it. And while I hate being "that guy," the Paul George injury is a reminder that you need to win as soon as possible. Wiggins may take a few years to develop into a good star. I don't think Kyrie's quite there yet, though he's really solid. Love is there, however.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Theory on Jim Carrey's "The Majestic" --- Peter was Luke all along </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-26 03:00:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This movie has been popping up on HBO a lot lately. It stars Jim Carrey and takes place shortly after World War II. 

Having watched it a few times this summer, I've developed a theory that Peter Appleton and Luke Trimble are one in the same. 

Evidence:

1. Early in the film, it's mentioned that Appleton attended college via the GI Bill. The GI Bill was available for those who also served on the homefront, but it connects the fact that both characters were in the military. 

2. Both characters had a connection to the movie industry. In Appleton's case, he was a writer in Hollywood. With Trimble, his family ran a movie threatre. If the Appleton/Trimble character suffered an injury during the war that resulted in a temporary loss in his memory, perhaps going to Hollywood and working on movies happened because of his childhood, similar to how the Pirates of the Sahara movie poster reminded the character of his life in Hollywood. 

3. There's a conversation between the doctor and Luke's dad during the town gathering scene about how Luke had been missing for years and years and lived another life. I thought this was hinting towards an ending revealing that Peter was Luke all along. However, I'll just use this as a hint regarding my theory. 

4. Luke's body was never found. Again, while I'm sure there were plenty of soldiers who were never recovered, this is an important basic fact in the theory. 

5. The whole town was convinced. A few townspeople had suspicions, but the fact that everyone bought into it gives this some credibility. 

6. Soldiers suffered from Dissociative Amnesia in real life and was first diagnosed following World War I. So, again, there is real life evidence backing up this theory. 

**TL;DR: Peter was actually Luke the entire time ---- and Peter was the life he had all the years he was missing.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know, it's not the ending I had such an issue about. The final scene was a little strange, but whatever. 

The biggest issue I had was Season 8 as a whole. Too many new characters for a show in its final season. Bad writing. Bad script. Even worse continuity than the average TV show. You know, say like LaGuerta getting murdered and barely being mentioned?

The ending gets hated on quite a bit, but it was tolerable compared to the season's arc. We should have gotten Dexter vs. Deb in some type of manner. That's the only storyline that would have been somewhat fresh.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obviously fans of those teams who lost out on the LeBron, Carmelo and Bosh sweepstakes will be upset that their teams couldn't land them. 

But what about moves across the league that you wish would have happened just as a basketball fan?

To me, I wish Carmelo Anthony would have signed with Chicago. Melo has never been on a team that was considered a favorite to win the championship. Chicago with Melo-Noah-Rose, along with a nice supporting cast, was going to be the favorites in the East IMO. It would have been interesting to watch Melo respond to that pressure. He played on some nice Nuggets team, but Denver was never considered a strong favorite to win a title. Neither have any of the Knicks teams he played on. Kobe, LeBron, Wade, Bosh, Duncan (and his teammates) have all been on teams that were favored to win titles. Not Carmelo.

Plus, having LeBron, Carmelo and Paul George in the same division could have set up some great rivalries between Chicago, Cleveland and Indiana. I hope Carmelo does well with the Knicks because the league is more fun when the Knicks are good, but I wish he would have signed with the Bulls.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reading that Woj column makes me wonder if LeBron had a master plan from the beginning. He leaves Cleveland, knowing that they'll be pretty bad for four years and that they'll have four lottery picks. During this four year run, he wins championships with Miami while Cleveland builds a team with a lot of young talent and future draft picks. 

I don't buy the whole "Dan Gilbert and LeBron planned this" conspiracy, but if the Heatles first talked about playing together at the 2008 Olympics, LeBron seeing the writing on the wall for Cleveland rebuilding is not too crazy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep. Trading for a 25-year-old power forward who averaged 26 and 12 last year seems like a no-brainer for me. If Love was in his early 30's, I'd understand why you would be hesitant to trade Wiggins. But Love, assuming he remains healthy, has a good 10 years left and that championship window opens immediately, rather than in two years.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think Sheridan's source was with Nike. He increased his odds of LeBron signing with Cleveland immediately after the Nike meeting this week. I imagine that meeting consisted of a marketing plan for LeBron's return home. I bet the letter was presented in some form and the Nike source gave Sheridan enough proof. Listening to Sheridan's interview on Colin Cowherd and reading his tweets all week makes me think his source knew of the letter, but thought it would be published on LeBronJames.com. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If they get Gasol, I think the Spurs are the strong favorite entering the season. They can rest Timmy even more and I imagine Gasol's workload will be smaller than normal, too. It gives Pop even more flexibility in managing his roster's minutes. 

I think the Cavs are two years away from winning a title. Even the Big 3 didn't click right away in year one. 

The most dangerous team from the East would be the Bulls if they somehow land Melo.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Final "gun to head" predictions: 

- LeBron goes back to Cleveland
- Carmelo goes to the Lakers
- Chris Bosh to Houston
- Kevin Love is traded to Cleveland later this month. 

All four of those predictions could easily be wrong. Regardless, I wish everyone's fans luck in the next few days. One of the very few things I'm happy about as a small-market team is we're not part of this drama too often. 

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think David Aldridge made a great point - LeBron knows how Cleveland is handling this speculation. He's worked hard on repairing his image after the 2010 deal and I just don't see him flushing it down the toilet. Part of it is media speculation, but if he honestly wasn't interested in Cleveland, I think he would have said so early on in the process. 

I thought Melo would stay in New York, but the longer this drags out, the more I think it favors the Lakers. Plus, if they can keep Gasol, a Kobe-Carmelo-Gasol-Randle lineup could be fun, though lacking defense.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that the longer this goes, the better for the Heat. 

That said, I think the fact that he's meeting Riley face to face means his future is clearly up in the air. If LeBron has a decision to announce to Riley and if his decision is to stay, why do it face to face? Why not just call, text or whatever so Riley can continue building his team? I think LeBron learned a lesson about how to exit gracefully after the 2010 deal. 

But who knows. I've went back and forth on this and I'm honestly at 50/50. There are "tea leafs" to read from both sides.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Overrated: Kobe

Underrated: Shaq

Both are all-time greats, but whenever I see some Kobe fans argue he's better than LeBron because of having five rings, they conveniently leave out the fact Shaq was the best player for three of them. Substitute LeBron for Kobe on those Laker teams and LeBron has five rings too. 

I think Shaq has become underrated in recent years in part due to jumping teams. Shaq's the only player in my life time who made a 30-point, 20-rebound game feel boring since he did it a lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry to disagree, but from what I've observed over the years, most Cleveland fans I know were only mad because of being rejected on national TV. LeBron himself has acknowledged that The Decision was a bad idea. I think Dan Gilbert had a come to Jesus moment on the letter he sent. 

Time heals all wounds. So does money and the chance to win a title in your hometown. 

EDIT: Also for what it's worth, the fan base that doesn't deserve him is Miami's. Those fans booed him in Game 4 of the Finals even after he led them  to four straight conference titles and two title games.

<TEXT> I'll add this in there --- he really never had a disappointing series even when the Bulls lost in the playoffs. As great as the Bad Boy Pistons were, he even averaged in the high 20's and low 30's against them in the postseason. Even against Orlando in 1995, he averaged 31 points in those six games. 

He doesn't have a bad series like LeBron did in 2010 or 2011. Or Magic Johnson did in the 1984 Finals - and Magic is my favorite player.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've went back and forth between Cleveland and Miami all week, but I'm going with Cleveland. 

To me, it's such a perfect storm of events. Miami not only loses in the Finals, but gets dominated in a historic fashion. Afterwards, Pat Riley calls out the Big 3 in a press conference, even if all three took less money to sign there and Miami let Mike Miller go for ownership purposes. In the process, Wade looks bad and LeBron's supporting cast was horrible. 

Cleveland, on the other hand, unexpectedly wins the lottery and drafts Andrew Wiggins, one of the most hyped pro prospects in a long time. They have a nice core of young talent already and financial flexibility now and for the future. They may not win the title next year with LeBron, but they are set for the next five to seven years if James goes back there. Miami? Big question mark. 

Unless Riley pulls something out of his hat in the next 24-48 hours, I think LeBron goes home.  </TEXT>

That said, I don't think losing is the only reason this drama is happening. The Mike Miller situation and Heat ownership not wanting to pay the luxury tax - after all three took millions less to sign there - rubbed the team the wrong way. I also think the Pat Riley press conference backfired as well. 

Since we're all throwing conspiracy theories out there, I'm wondering if LeBron and Bosh are dragging this thing out as long as possible to hurt the Heat.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This may not be necessarily answering the question, but I wish Magic would have been able to finish out his career on his own terms. 

A lot of fans forget Magic retired at the age of 31, meaning he had at least five to six good seasons left in him. While he was older, he was still playing very well in 1991, averaging 19.4 and 12.5 assists. He also averaged 19, 12 and 8 against the Bulls in the '91 Finals without a completely healthy Worthy and Byron Scott. I still think the Bulls win the title that year, but it goes 6 or 7 with a healthy Lakers team. 

But if Magic plays five to six more seasons, I imagine Jerry West would have found a way to build a solid roster around him. Perhaps the Lakers trade for Barkley instead of the Suns? How about Magic, Shaq and Kobe on the 1996-97 team? 

A lot of what if's, but if Magic didn't get HIV, there may have been two more titles and three to four more Finals appearances in his column. If Magic retired with seven titles and 13 finals appearances, the debate between Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson becomes very interesting.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> WANTED: Digital salesperson, 50 percent commission on all sales, thousands of leads available </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-17 03:58:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Edge Media Technologies is looking for an experienced salesperson to increase business for our network of local news Websites in Wyandotte County and Johnson County.

Edge Media Technologies publishes four Websites: The Kansas City Kansan (KCKansan.com), The Gardner Edge (GardnerEdge.com), The De Soto Edge (DeSotoEdge.com) and The Olathe Edge (OlatheEdge.com).

The Kansan and Gardner Edge have been in existence for nearly four years. The De Soto Edge and The Olathe Edge were launched in January 2013. 

Together, the Websites average over 70,000 different readers each month.

The position is commission only to start out with. The commission rate is 50 percent on all sales and is uncapped. The potential salesperson would also have thousands of leads available, as one-third of all economic activity in the State of Kansas happens in either Johnson County or Wyandotte County. In our four communities alone, there are at least 19,000 businesses.

We sell display advertising, business directory ads (similiar to chamber of commerce memberships) and job postings. 

The ideal candidate would have these features:

- At least three years of sales experience, with media sales a plus. Training in digital sales is available.

- The commitment to conduct follow-up calls. Most sales deals are closed on the fourth or fifth try in digital marketing.

- A self-starter with a record of working independently and "grabbing the ball and running with it" when it comes to closing deals.

- A great understanding of today's technology, particularly computers, mobile phones and social media - i.e. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

While this is a commission-only position at this time, as our company continues to grow, a negotiated salary could be determined down the road.
Though there comes risk with a commission-only position, there is high reward. This is a position that has high-income possibilities, combining our aggressive commission rates and the high leads already available.

Those interested in this position should email a resume, cover letter and references to Director of Marketing/Sales Joel Johns at joel@olatheedge.com and Nick Sloan at nick@olatheedge.com. </TEXT>

In the first eight years of his coaching career, Doc Rivers failed to win a playoff series in Orlando and Boston. He was on the verge of getting fired in Boston before they landed KG and Ray Allen. 

Flash forward to 2014 and Rivers is regarded by many NBA fans as a Top 3-5 coach in the league. The Clips traded a draft pick to land his services. 

I'm not saying Jackson's going to win a title, but his first three years as a coach compared to many are not too bad.  </TEXT>

2. On the 99.9 percent likelihood they say no, interview and hire Ben Howland. It would be the first time ever that Mizzou's head coach would have a Final Four on his resume. He would bring credibility to the basketball program. He wouldn't get the same superstar talent he did at UCLA, but he could do a job comparable to the one he did at Pittsburgh.  It may not be a grand slam hire, but it would be a bases-clearing double and would put Mizzou Top 3/4 yearly in the SEC. </TEXT>

2. USC - With respect to the other great programs, I think the USC coaching job is the best college football job in America. Great tradition, great weather, great academics, great recruiting area, money and in a major market. I think the job has become underrated in recent years with all the SEC domination.

3. LSU - Great recruiting area, money, tradition and I think Baton Rouge is the best "gameday" environment in the country. It's underrated among SEC jobs.

- What if James Franklin was healthy all season long? Perhaps Mizzou beats South Carolina.....but perhaps that injury helped Mizzou for next year, too. Mauk gained valuable experience, so the injury worked both ways. 

- What if Georgia beats Auburn and the first Auburn miracle doesn't happen? Football is a game of match-ups and while I think Alabama was just as good as Auburn was, I think they may have been a better match-up for Mizzou in the SEC title game. Preparing for Auburn's offense in six days was a tough chore and they were the hottest team in the country at that point. Plus, looking back at how OU and Texas A M threw the ball on them, Mizzou's passing game could have been tricky for Alabama. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1, 2, 4, 7, 5, 3, 6, 8, though 8 is really the only season I didn't like. 

I give Season 1 the edge primarily because of how it ended. It was a bit slow at the beginning, but it picked up and just gathered steam towards a great ending. I thought Season 2's ending was a cop-out and it loses a few points with me there. Still a great season. 

Compared to most Dexter fans I know, I liked Season 5 more and I think it gets a bit of a bum wrap. I understand a few of the complaints about it (how Rita is rarely mentioned after S5E1), but I liked how it changed from a "big bad" to a group of people. It was a good change-up after focusing on one big bad guy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I fully admit that this is based on being a Mizzou fan....but the whole immediate "conference is overrated" argument you hear if the best conference teams aren't traditional powers. There was a lot of talk this year about the SEC being overrated because of Mizzou and Auburn playing for the SEC title. If Auburn was called LSU or Alabama and Mizzou's resume came from a team called Florida or Georgia, there would have been no talk about the SEC being overrated. 

And for what it's worth, let me defend the Big 12 here: Just because Baylor was the Big 12 champion doesn't mean the conference stunk. They were a really good team and Briles is one of the best coaches in the country. Again, if Oklahoma or Texas had done what Baylor did this year, there would have been more "BCS national title" contender buzz about them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree, but the one possible angle for a competitor like Saban is winning a national title at three different schools. That would be one of the most unbreakable records in sports. The only guy who'd have a realistic shot at it is Urban Meyer, but he's not leaving Ohio State unless the NFL calls. 

While Alabama is a great job and the best program in the country right now, Texas is one of the few jobs where a coach can compete right away. Saban would have that program competing for a national title by year two.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a list of 7-10 episodes I really like the best, but I'll just stick with two of them.

1. "Born Free," the Season 1 finale. While I had a feeling Rudy/Brian was the ITK, I did not see the brother twist coming (Didn't read the books). Lithgow's performance as Trinity was the best, but I enjoyed Brian's story better. The interactions between the two brothers as Deb laid on the table was great. Then, Dexter killing Brian and exhibiting emotion for the first time in the show was fantastic too. Everything about that episode was great. 

2. "Hello, Dexter Morgan." In my opinion, the ending to the episode is the greatest scene in the series. The cat and mouse game between the two killers was awesome and it was great to see Dexter finally outsmarted by someone. The final few episodes of the season were terrific, but this one was my favorite.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not bad, but I actually liked Season 5 and I would only change one big detail: Deb should have pulled the curtain in the season finale and discover who the vigilante killers were. I think that moment started the decline of Dexter, at least compared to the first four seasons. 

Deb finding out there would have solved a few of the remaining issues many have with Season 5. 

- It gives Lumen a perfectly legitimate reason to bail on Miami rather than "losing" her dark passenger. Deb, who sympathized with the rape victims throughout the season, let's her go for this reason and she disappears forever.

- It doesn't tie everything neatly into a bow. The cliffhanger could be Deb debating on what she does with Dexter.

If I could make one major change, it would have been this one. It also eliminates the Season 6 we got and this alternate Season 6 could have been the final season with perhaps a different ending.

<TEXT> I believe the Drug War should be brought to an end and all drugs should be legalized. The prohibition of drugs creates a lot of the violence we see in larger cities. The federal government has turned the drug trade into a big business. In addition, addicts are often forced to steal or rob homes/businesses to satisfy their habits, creating even more crime and more victims. It's a negative domino effect that's been created by government and law enforcement. 

I say legalize drugs, regulate them and use a good chunk of the money to fund drug counselors that can help drug addicts.  It's time to stop treating non-violent drug offenders as criminals and treat them as people who have a disease, similar to how we treat alcoholics now. 

You would have less violence on the streets, you would have significantly fewer prisons in America and you'd save billions of dollars on a federal program that does not work. And oddly enough, the addicts would be the greatest beneficiary as they could acquire their drugs in a safer manner and not jeopardize the lives of others. 

I'm not sure how unpopular this is, but each time I talk to one of my liberal or conservative friends about this issue, I get eye-rolls and strange stares in return.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> At his peak, I'll still take Dan Marino over any other quarterback I've ever seen. The cannon arm, the quick release and the lack of fear in his decision making. 

He put up 2010-13 numbers in 1984 and he crushed the production levels of other quarterbacks.

It's sad that this whole "you need a title to vindicate your career" garbage has been shoved down everyone's throats courtesy of ESPN and other sports outlets. Marino only had one 1,000-yard rusher during his Dolphins' career. During his 17 years, Miami only had four Top 10 defenses in that same stretch. 

On top of that, he played in an era where the quarterback position wasn't protected to the extent by officials that it is now, and cornerbacks were allowed to be physical with wide receivers.

Rod Woodson remarked that Dan Marino would have thrown for 100,000 career yards if he played in this era. I don't know if that's true, but the point is valid. 

He was a great quarterback and has become criminally underrated because of this championship obsession NFL media and fans have.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whether it's Democrats bashing Ralph Nader or Republicans bashing Robert Sarvis or Ross Perot, it's always pathetic when the two major parties blame a third-party candidate for a loss. The two parties have a monopoly on money and media coverage. They have no disadvantage against a third-party candidate. 

Plus, Ronald Reagan crushed Jimmy Carter in 1980 with a moderate Republican (John Anderson) running as an Independent candidate. Also, Harry Truman won in 1948 even with the Democratic Party splitting in three.

<TEXT> Following the history of third parties, there needs to be either a charismatic candidate (Teddy Roosevelt in 1912), big money (Ross Perot) or an issue that unites many Americans (the anti-slavery movement leading to the Republican Party's creation). Big money is invested in the two parties, so that's out. While I respect Gary Johnson and will vote for him in 2016 again, I don't see him being the type to capture America's imagination. 

I think Libertarians need to unite and push the issue of the debt. While many issues are important, the debt is something that does concern younger people (I'm 28). One of the dirtiest secrets of the GOP winning the House in 2010 was the fact social issues played little role in the win. The message of "liberty" is nice for those like us, but most Americans don't vote based on philosophy. They're middle of the road. I think Libertarians have to find a way to craft a message of fiscal responsibility that resonates with voters.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Magic Johnson's my favorite player of all-time, but this is good news. Magic's analysis was terrible and Doug Collins was my favorite analysis when he was doing work for NBC. Good upgrade.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I liked the plot twist and was stunned at the ending, part of me always wished Rita would have found out about Dexter.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ralph Fiennes should have won for his portrayal of Amon Goeth in Schindler's List. Fiennes was amazing in that movie.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He outplayed a quarterback who's arguably in the middle of the greatest stretch of quarterback play in NFL history. On another note, if Tom Brady or Peyton Manning were sacked in the manner Romo was on the play before, it's a horse-collar penalty. 

Tough break, but Romo played one of the best 10 games I've seen a quarterback play. That last pass doesn't eliminate that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The 2002 Elite Eight game against Oklahoma. Gilbert, my second favorite Tigers player ever, had his version the John Starks game. Mizzou also missed several free throws and still only lost the game by six points. 

If Mizzou wins, they play a very beatable Indiana team with a chance to play for the national title. Plus, it gets the Final Four monkey off of our program's back. 

While the '09 Elite Eight loss to UCONN stung, UCONN was a great team and Mizzou had a great run. Losing to a conference rival in an Elite Eight game stings far more.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's probably one of Pinkel's better road wins. Dominating a decent SEC team on the road is a nice way to open up the conference season and give the football program some good momentum. After a bad season last year, eight to nine wins is doable, which most around the SEC didn't expect. 

Murray against Mizzou's secondary terrifies me. Mizzou's offense is good enough to compete against UGA. Bet the over.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Matthews knew about Dexter from the beginning. I thought Season 8 would have revealed that for sure, especially the fact that Matthews consistently helped both Dexter and Deb throughout the series because of his relationship with Harry. I thought they were going down this path when he brought Vogel in on the season opener.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There were a handful of missed opportunities. I didn't like the cop-out ending in Season 2. Deb should have found out at the end of Season 5. I thought Brian as Dexter's ghost would have been interesting path for the last half of Season 6, but nothing. 

However, LaGuerta's death essentially having no impact on Season 8 was unforgivable for the story. Season 7 was a pretty good season IMO with an ending that naturally set-up a shit-storm for Dexter and Deb in Season 8. However, that did not happen. Season 8 should have picked up immediately where Season 7 ended. Instead, we had new characters and an underwhelming "Big Bad" for the final season. 

Despite the flaws of the first seven seasons, there was still a great opportunity to end the series on a high note. However, they dropped the ball on LaGuerta's death.  </TEXT>
