<TEXT> While it's true the blog post might be barbed in tone, it is still not wrong though. There really is no good evidence that cupping works. The author might have looked at the evidence against it but chosen not to post about it. The burden of proof is on the one making the claim but not otherwise. And, the quacks are the ones making such unsubstantiated claims. 

I understand the author's frustration. There are lots of people getting swindled for an otherwise ineffective procedure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have done first year chemistry and yes I have dealt with that. And I have used Bayes theorem to model evolutionary trees. 

You do not need to master science to see through the stupidity of the Bible and the mythical delusional nonsense therein. Anybody with a sensible state of mind will know that it is hugely improbable that Jesus walked on water or that he brought people back from the dead or that he created the universe. You can be an idiot and see through it. 

I don't need to understand science to know that it does indeed work in the same way that I don't need to understand how computers work to know that they actually do. 

What exactly is your point? I don't need to be a scientist to refute the crap that is the Bible and see how much of an ignorant fucktard Jesus was.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember, as a child, being told by a Saudi Islamic teacher, that Muslims should only sleep 4 hours so they can make sure they wake up in time for fajr prayer. He also said that sleeping 8 hours a day is not good and it's something the West made up so they make sure Muslims sleep in and don't make it for prayer. He said its their plan to bring Muslims down..He sleeps only 4 hours a day because of this, lol and says he never missed a fajr prayer

Sounds absolutely ludicrous but this is exactly what he said. Utterly stupid but this is yet again what religion will turn people into. I'm glad I left this country (Saudi Arabia) a long time ago.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> ask him if he seriously believes that an ignorant cave-dwelling carpeneter created the universe with all its stars and galaxies. Or, if he walked on water. Or if he turned into wafer. Or whatever nonsense that is in the bible. It is you who should be upset at your Dad's mindset gullibly believing ridiculous nonsense and taking in traditional claims at face value without questioning them. Religion corrupts people's thinking abilities and reasoning faculties. 

EDIT: Actually, don't do that if it will make problems escalate or if he will take it seriously. You can pretend you are religious for the time being and lie to him and tell him you do believe in this carpenter fuck named Jesus, while in fact you dont to avoid any serious consequences.   </TEXT>

I am not a fanboy so I could watch every single thing that has Cumberbatch in its cast. I am not saying he shoudl be forced to do the BBC shows - of course not. He has his choice to star in Hollywood movies. And, I have my choice not to watch them. But, it is just my opinion that he would suck as any other role than Sherlock.

<TEXT> Of course he can choose whatever he wants to do but I just don't like Hollywood. And, you know, to each his own. I will continue to watch his BBC dramas - just not those other movies he is choosing to do that are impacting Sherlock greatly (we have to wait till 2017 for the next series just because of this Dr Strange shit). After all, Sherlock is the show that shot him to international fame. The BBC is the reason why he is famous. So, I find his leaving aside the BBC and going to Hollywood a little bit disingenuous (again, just an opinion).  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Muslim shiekh: "This is what will happen to you in your grave. Repent and do good deeds before it is too late!" Acts it out in a video. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-28 20:57:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here is a video I found on a Muslim facebook page: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkxkfZ2twP4 I uploaded it to YouTube since I cannot post Facebook videos here. I do not know who the original owner of the video is but it was not even the facebook page itself. The video is being wildly circulated across Muslim pages. 

But, this is truly laughable and ridiculous. The guy starts off saying this is how you will be in your grave. Then he says you will plead with God so you can get back to life so you can do good deeds but then it will be too late and that will be it. He also says you will wish for just a single good deed that you have done in your life so you escape punishment. Afterwards, he advises all Muslims to do good deeds and work hard to reap the rewards when the time finally comes.

Then the most ridiculous part comes. He asks God to turn the graves of people who share this video into a heavenly place of eternal rewards and not to make it a "pit" of Hell (probably explains why the video has about 150,000 shares lol). He also asks God to prevail upon people who share this video to do good deeds so they do not face a grim ending when they die. Then he says, with God all things are possible and finally, asks Allah to send his blessings upon the "Prophet" Muhammad. 

I'm absolutely stunned by the immense absurdity. Seriously what the heck was that?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I came across this image from a Muslim Facebook page: http://i.imgur.com/ugfeyUU.jpg 

It shows a Muslim with a gun looking out for a Jew to kill him and a tree speaking to alert the Muslim that there is a Jew hiding behind it and should be killed.

This is absolutely ridiculous, but it is funny how many Muslims actually believe this (that trees will speak). According to Saudi cleric Muhammad Al-Arifi: 

"Studies conducted in Tel Aviv and in the Palestinian lands occupied by the Jews showed that they plant  trees around their homes, because the Prophet Muhammad said that when the Muslims fight the Jews, each and every stone and tree will say: Oh Muslim, oh servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. The only exception is the  gharqad tree, which is one of the trees of the Jews, and if they hide behind it, it will not reveal their presence. According to reports of people who went there and saw it with their own eyes, many Jews plant  gharqad trees around their homes, so that when the fighting begins, they can hide behind them. They are not man enough to stand and fight you. " 

Here is also a hadith: 

" Sahih Bukhari Hadith Volume 4, Book 52, Number 176: Narrated by 'Abdullah bin 'Umar: Allah's Apostle said, "You (i.e. Muslims) will fight with the Jews till some of them will hide behind stones. The stones will (betray them) saying, 'O 'Abdullah (i.e. slave of Allah)! There is a Jew hiding behind me; so kill him.'" Sahih Bukhari Hadith Volume 4, Book 52, Number 177: Narrated by Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, "The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. "O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him."

That's the so-called religion of peace, eh?  </TEXT>

He said: Do not stop unless you hear a sound or notice a smell.

<DATE> 2015-08-28 10:20:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, today. I was speaking with my Muslim friend. He went on with all this nonsense about how Islam has always prophesied scientific theories. One of the examples he came up with really made me laugh hysterically. He said that their Prophet discovered a cure ages ago. That cure is: if a fly falls into your drink, dip it in the drink because one of its wings can cure disease. Here is the hadith in full: http://i.imgur.com/bWMAplL.jpg. He kept going with this stupidity about how scientists today discovered that this is true. And, bla bla bla. After doing my own research today, I found that it was utter nonsense and dipping a fly in a drink would actually be injurious, given the number of diseases that can be transmitted. And, even, if you accept this as true ( for the sake of his stupid argument), then any so-called antibiotics in the fly and any associated benefits they may accord would be quite inconsequential compared to the multitude of pathogens that can replicate rapidly. 

But in our conversation I honestly just couldn't reply. Because I was laughing out loud at this lunacy. Honestly, made my day. 

This is the Islamic science that Muslims keep telling us all about?! How unhygienic! It is probably not a good idea to get sick in a Muslim country. What if they give you a fly in a cup of water as a treatment, lol?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I found this question on the IslamQA website: http://islamqa.info/en/6496

I find it very pernicious to tell children that if they die while still being children, they will definitely go to heaven. A Muslim friend of mine remembers being told this by his teacher when he was a kid. He said he kept hoping that he would die as a child so he can get into paradise. 

I feel that it is quite pernicious and terribly wrong to say something like that to a child. What if they kill themselves "to get into heaven"? That would be terrible. 

There is also some discussion on whether Non-muslim children will get into heaven if they die. The answer is quite ridiculous:  "they will either be in Paradise or in Hell, depending on whether they would have obeyed Allah if they had lived (something that only Allah would know)."

Also - I realized, why is it that with most of these Islamic questions, there is always this statement that "The scholars are divided and bla bla bla". They can't seem to make up their own minds about anything, it seems.  </TEXT>

Halfway through the passage in the link I attached, a sentence starts with "The scholars discussed...". LOL I can imagine scholars sitting on a table, discussing "the sin of drawing animate beings". Such a trivial matter causes this much concern lol?

<TEXT> No, you stupid idiot, Saudi Arabia's constitution is the Quran. Article 1 of Saudi Arabia's Basic Law of Governance states that the "constitution is Almighty God's book, the Holy Quran, and the Sunna (Traditions) of the Prophet". 

Again like a fucker, you are taking my words out of context. I said you cannot deny the fact that there are Muslims who want Islamic domination. And, they are actually good people too because they believe that what they are doing is righteous and that these acts are good because it says so in the Quran. The reason why I alluded to those statistics is to show what religion can do to good normal people and how it can make good people do bad things. That was the purpose of my quoting those stats. 

"No, you didn't. What you said is that Muslims don't respect other people's laws and alluded to the Islamic takeover of the Earth. Like a nutter butter." again more stupid bullshit you are spouting, you stupid rascal. I never said Muslims don't respect other people's laws I was talking about the minority again to show what religion does to people. My original  post was about Saudi Arabia and how they disrespect people's laws. For example, Egypt, which I have also been to, respects Non-Muslims and their right to worship. They have churches and synagogues, etc and it is a Muslim country. The essence of me quoting the minority of Muslims was about religion and not those people themselves. Again, I said they are good people who have been brainwashed by religion to do something bad and consider it as a good deed. 

Again, you are accusing me of making up this story when I am prepared to swear that this is exactly what happened to me in Saudi Arabia!! I don't care whether you believe it or not. As a matter of fact, you can go fuck yourself. 

And actually, what's your problem you pathetic loser? Ok..For the sake of your stupid and embarrassing argument, yes I actually did obey their laws you motherfucker. I did pray when they told me to. And, I did leave the mall when they asked me to. Now I'm here in Canada and I'm free to criticise them all I want. I have the right to criticise them in this great country of mine. I am protected by the country's freedom of speech laws. Now you are disrespecting Canada's laws by asking me to stop ranting and criticising what they do. And by doing so, you are also disrespecting my country. I am free to criticise their flogging of Non-Muslims and their unlawful imprisonment of innocent people, and rant about it all I want.  So, what is your problem you stupid idiot? Even my Saudi friends who live here in Canada would agree with what I say and with my criticizing their nonsense. What the fuck is your problem?!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What the fuck?! No. You basically said that a Non-muslim visitor to Saudi Arabia should obey their laws. Which means that -- for a non-muslim worshiping peacefully (and even privately) over there and getting arrested afterwards, it is actually their problem and they should respect that and accept whatever punishment that might ensue. Saudi Arabia's constitution is the Quran. That is their law and constitution. So, when you say "Obey they're laws", you are basically saying that non-Muslims visiting there should convert to Islam because Saudi Arabia's constitution says so. The Quran says that people should follow Islam. 

I did not say all Muslims are bad. Now you are the one who is putting words in my mouth. I said that the majority is always irrelevant. It is the minority which always commits the terrorist attacks. The "individual scope" is always the problem. It is the individuals who commit the attacks. What I am trying to say is that this should not be ignored. Your argument about peaceful Muslims l is irrelevant and has nothing to do with my original point. 

Yes I was talking about Muslims when I quoted this stats. But what I meant is they harbor these views because of the authoritarian structures within Islam. You have good people doing something bad and thinking that it's good because of the religion is ordering them to kill blasphemers and convert people to Islam. Muslims take the Quran literally unlike Christians; you stupid idiot. So, they believe everything the Quran has to say and follow it word for word. 

I am certainly not lying about this!! How infantile, disrespectful, and stupid of you to say so! Just go to Saudi Arabia and see for yourself. Scour the internet; you will find hundreds of similar stories. Double check everything I said in my story; you will find that others have experienced similar incidents. Go ahead; you don't have to believe me. Why would I care? And, why would I even lie about my location you stupid idiot? Yes I do live in Canada and I don't have to prove it to you. 

Since you made up stuff about me. I am going to speculate that  that you are a butt-hurt Saudi hiding behind a fake profile and incensed because I defamed your country. 

Good luck if you ever happen to visit Saudi Arabia. And Good luck if you are not a Muslim. Don't come back to us asking for help since we have to respect their laws. Put yourself in the position of hundreds innocent migrant workers in Saudi Arabia who broke no laws and obeyed them but are still in jail and are being tortured for no reason; they would be so offended by your terrible statements. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have no problems with Muslims having a place of worship, halal restaurants, etc...but why is it that you think that Non-Muslims should not be accorded the same rights in Muslim countries? Why do you think only Muslims should have this privilege and that Non-Muslims in Saudi Arabia being arrested for worshipping (even when in private) should go fuck themselves and that they should be respectful of Saudi Arabia's laws?! I don't think the hundreds of innocent prisoners being tortured in Saudi Arabia would agree with you that the West should turn a blind eye and respect Saudi's laws. Do you think that when William Sampson, an innocent Westerner, who was tortured for 2 years and was on death row would have agreed with you that Britain should not have intervened on his behalf because Saudi laws should be respected. This is someone who was completely innocent, did not break any laws, but yet was sentenced to death. Read his story here: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/14/saudiarabia-humanrights. He says his case is among thousands of others. How can anyone not speak out against this?! Why should we be such acquiescent fools because of Saudi Arabia's so-called "sacred laws"?! 

Did you even read my comment well? I said "1 in 5 US (or about 300,000) Muslims agrees that violence should be used to enforce Sharia law". Google it and see for yourself. They think blasphemy should be treated by violence as was the case with the Charlie Hebdo massacre. 

I live in Canada and Muslims are respected and they celebrate their festivals all they want and they do whatever they please (things which I have absolutely no problem with). However, look at what happens to Non-muslims when they go to countries like Saudi Arabia, they are lashed if they practise their faith; do you think they should respect this? Why do you think it is Ok for Muslims to worship their God but Non-Muslims should not and should obey Saudi laws?! Your reasoning is quite flawed. 

It is very dishonest of you to use a word like Islamophobia because Islam is not a race. You are confusing my criticism of Islamic authoritarianism with hatred of Muslims. People like you who keep calling others Islamophobic are themselves phobic of criticism of Islamic idealogy. So you have nothing better to do than hurl libelous statements at me. 

And by the way, I know very well what the Saudi National curriculum teaches because I have friends who used to live in Saudi Arabia and were raised there. The religion books teach young kids that Non-Muslims should be hated and that Islam will take over the world because that is the will of God. The sermons at the mosques are replete of derogatory terms towards Non-Muslims such as "pigs" and "monkeys". And, you cannot deny the fact that there are Muslims who want Islamic domination. This is not a generalization. You can google the stats and see for yourself. I don't care what the majority thinks or if the majority is "peaceful". The majority is always inapplicable. It certainly was inapplicable when the 9/11 attacks occurred. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, do you think we should be respectful of their laws when they sentence a blogger to 10 years in jail and 1000 lashes just because he setup a website calling for reform? Do you think we should be respectful of Muslim laws when many Muslims do not respect our own laws? They come here to our country and they want to enforce Sharia law. 1 in 5 US (or about 300,000) Muslims agrees that violence should be used to enforce Sharia law   51 percent agree that Muslims should be governed according to Sharia law. Also, 40 percent of UK Muslims have been polled as saying that they want Sharia law to be enforced in the UK. And, about 1/3 of UK Muslims believe apostasy should be punishable by death. Why should we be respectful of their laws when they hate ours? 

Edit: I have no idea what this Gizortnik guy wants. What he is basically saying is that Non-Muslims going to Saudi Arabia should obey their laws which means they should also convert to Islam since Saudi Arabia's constitution is the Quran. But for the sake of his embarrassing argument, I did obey their stupid laws. I prayed when they told me to and I left the mall when they asked me to. Now I'm here in Canada and I'm free to criticise them for their contemptible actions as much as I want. I am protected by my country's freedom of speech laws and he should respect my country's laws and not ask me to stop ranting. 

He accuses me of being an Islamophobic bigot because I mentioned some stats about Muslims who agree with using violence to enforce Sharia law. What I meant when I used these stats was to criticise authoritarian Islamic idealogy and provide an example of how religion can brainwash good people and make them do bad things thinking that they are actually good "because God said so". He is yet another example of standard dishonesty by people who keep throwing around the "Islamophobic" label flippantly when they feel incensed due to criticism of Islamic totalitarianism; so they just resort to labels like "Islamophobic" and "bigot". 

He then accuses me of making this whole story up, when I am prepared to swear that this is exactly what happened to me in Saudi Arabia, word for word!! So, not only did he accuse me of bigotry but also of lying, just because I am criticising Saudi Arabia's religious police and their heinous crimes. Why is he so infuriated by what I said about the Saudi religious police that he is prepared to make unsubstantiated accusations about me? Is he a Saudi or something hiding behind a fake profile and enraged because I am denouncing his country's laws?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Experience with Saudi Arabia's Contemptible Religious Police </TITLE>

<TEXT> Dear readers,

I am writing this post to bring awareness to a group of loathsome, vile and reprehensible people known as the Committee of Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, also known as Saudi Arabia's religious police.  I feel that their crimes have not been documented greatly or that there has been little coverage over what they do. It strikes me that such a group for people, with all of the deluded pseudo-scientific twaddle that they espouse in this narrow-minded mentality of theirs, are able to influence many aspects of daily life in this Godforsaken Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.


As a person who visited Saudi Arabia for a while, I have witnessed, greatly a deal, a lot of their contemptible acts that have so far infringed upon the personal freedoms of the people who live over there. A few years ago, I was once standing outside a store when suddenly it was prayer time. In Saudi Arabia, it is an absolute requirement that all shops and stores close immediately 10 minutes before prayer time and that everyone cease any activity that they are doing and head to the nearest mosque to pray. During that time, the religious police roam the streets in order to make sure everyone is praying. So I was just standing there when it was prayer time and suddenly, I find a car driving straight towards me with the religious police logo on it and suddenly, those fat-ass sheep-herding fuckers get out of the car, with their stupid kufiyah on their heads, and immediately question me as to who I am and request ID cards as if what I just did was a crime. They later force me inside their car and keep asking whether I am a Muslim or a Christian and why is it that I am not praying and a diatribe of stupid religious bullshit that they kept spouting. They call their "boss" or something of the sort and tell him exactly: "we have caught someone who just behaved mischievously and didn't head into the mosque when it was prayer time.  What do you suggest we do with him?" I never got to know what they were told. But, then soon, I find them requesting that they record my ID information and then they drive me to the nearest mosque and force me to pray. I acquiesced because I thought it was the safe option given that those are a bunch of brainwashed insane religious nutters who would do anything to make sure people pray. Afterwards, they drove me back to where I was and lectured me on the Day of Judgement and the importance of prayer, bla, bla, bla, and a bunch of other crap. Fortunately, for me, nothing else happened afterwards although I have no idea why they recorded my ID information. According to some of my friends who lived there, people who were caught not praying more than once were detained and held in custody for a while. They actually warned me that if they catch me doing this again, they might consider sending me to jail. But, I was able to leave the country afterwards with no incident and I vowed never to return to this terrible shithole of a country again.


It absolutely surprises me that such nonsense and stupidity is actually institutionalized by the Saudi government itself. The Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice is actually is a government agency that employs the religious police to enforce Sharia law. What kind of country is this? You would be amazed by the other things I witnessed over my very unfortunate stay in this backwards, uncivilized country. For example, all of the malls cater only for families. If you are on your own without any family member, you are not allowed to enter a mall at all. That is because they want to make sure gender segregation is enforced and that people of the opposite gender should not be at the same place unless accompanied by a family member. Now it doesn't matter even how old you are. A friend of mine who is 50 was not allowed inside the mall because he is on his own. How incredibly stupid and weird and infantile that is!! I have never seen somthing like this in my life. You can't even make this up. You just enter the malls and you find those wretched religious fuckers standing there with their fucking protruding beards and their fucking miswak up their ass (actually mouth but then again, what do you call a mouth that spouts bullshit?) and then they are like: " you can't be here on your own. Where is your family?". Well, you retarded fuckwits, I am here to go get some shopping done. But, they are just so narrow-minded and stupid, all they think about is the "risk of individuals of the opposite gender mixing". What the actual FUCK is this? I am enraged at their stupidity. I just lashed at them and told them I am here for grocery. They still kicked me out of the mall and threatened to arrest me if I continue to disobey. This is cringe-worthy. I just can't imagine how people with this stone-age mentality and behaviour still exist in the 21st century?! Even restaurants are segregated into a "Singles" section for males only and another section for families and married couples only. Single women are not allowed unless they are accompanied by male chaperons. And they are both completely separated with a security guard standing outside to make sure such rules are obeyed. Oh and by the way, I was told that even inside malls (which only allow families in), the line-ups are separated with a barrier to separate males and females and the barrier itself is opaque and not transparent so they can't see each other. How cringeworthy and weird that is!


Oh and the women over there are required to dress up in black garbage sacs (a black cloak actually but what better way to describe it, lol). The religious police roam the streets to make sure this requirement is met and if not, they insult the non-abiders and call them "infidel" and even arrest them if they do not obey this shitty dress code.

These people are even really weird. I was once told by another friend of mine who lived in Saudi Arabia, that he remembers as a kid, when once, his religion teacher who was also a member of the Commission of the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, told them of a story of a time when he was fighting Satan, in a bathroom, but because he did not say "Bismillah", an Islamic phrase thought to protect against evil, Satan was able to empower him and he slipped and fell off and broke his leg. That is the weirdest story I have ever heard? What the actual FUCK?! These people are so stupid; they think Satan is real. In fact, that same teacher told the young kids that Satan dwells in the toilets. The school received complaints by parents the next day that their kids do not want use the toilet because they are afraid that Satan might be inside. Another kid was told by this teacher that he will die soon because he doesn't pray. The kid kept crying for days until he was finally convinced by his parents that he will not die. Now that is child abuse right there.


Being a non-Muslim over there is basically a crime. In fact, any religious places of worship other than mosques are illegal. So, there are no synagogues, no churches, no temples; only mosques. Non-Muslims are not even allowed to practise their faith even in private. I am constantly reminded of this incident back in 2007 when a priest was arrested and deported for celebrating mass in a private residence: http://www.asianews.it/news-en/After-jail,-Christians-pray-for-Saudi-king-Abdallah-14684.html. A year later, a Saudi man, who was also a member of the religious police, burned his daughter to death for converting to Christianity: http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/saudi-man-kills-daughter-for-converting-to-christianity-1.124541. And these are just few incidents among hundreds of other hate crimes that are perpetually committed by the religious police every now and then.


Now, as I said before, their actions are instituionalized. Perhaps another example of their pseudo-scientific delusions that they are mired in, can be  demonstrated by this special unit that they set up to fight "magic". (link: http://modernnotion.com/saudi-arabia-anti-witchcraft-unit/). They have an anti-sorcery hotline too! In fact, Harry Potter movies are banned over there and it is a crime to possess them as they "promote sorcery". In Saudi Arabia, sorcery (something that doesn't even exist) is punishable by death. Death sentences in Saudi Arabia are carried out by public beheadings. What more can be said but the fact that this religious police are real terrorists funded by the Saudi government. Why is nobody speaking about this? Why do we continue to support such a repressive, backwards, delusional, fairy-tale believing, and morally repugnant regime as that of Saudi Arabia?!


You can scour the internet for lots of other weird stuff that they do. An incident I am constantly reminded of is the 2002 school fire in Mecca which you can read about here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Mecca_girls'_school_fire. It was a school fire that occurred in 2002 and killed 15 young girls. The religious police were responsible because they refused to let rescue personell inside because the girls were not wearing the required dress code (the garbage bags I talked about earlier). They even refused to let the schoolgirls leaving the burning building.


Now something which bugs is why the West continues to support such a morally repressive and abominable regime. Where is Amnesty International?! I call upon them to look into the CPVPV and bring awareness to the crimes that they commit! Something must be done. These people must pay for their actions?! They hate the West and the Western culture. Let's not forget the story of William Sampson, a dual Canadian-British national who was arrested by police officers and religious police members and tortured severely for two years in order to confess to a crime he never committed. He never received a fair trial and he was continually beaten and tortured from the get-go. He was sentenced to death but was released 2 and a half years later after British intervention. Why did the West wait so much to secure his release? Why wasn't he prevented from suing his captors when he returned home? You can read his very unfortunate story here: http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/sampson/interview1.html and here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn9AGsTrEwM and here: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/14/saudiarabia-humanrights


We should cut all diplomatic ties with this Godforsaken country. Why is it that the West is not doing anything about the human right abuse issues in Saudi Arabia where floggings and be-headings are a common routine? This regime needs to be toppled and replaced. Western countries should undermine the Saudi regime by imposing sanctions and boycotting oil. I hope that someday, this will happen. The Saudi royal family can then go fuck itself.  </TEXT>

The point stands that Saudi Arabia is an authoritarian, repressive, cringe-worthy regime with a fucked up legal system.

<TEXT> Again, doesn't make it OK for Saudi Arabia to cut people's heads off for no reason. In the US, you can speak out against it and hold protests to condemn this. In Saudi Arabia, you will be arrested and tortured if you speak out against what they do. Protests are a crime. It's an authoritarian regime where you have to abide by their morally repugnant laws without questioning them. Most recently, they sentenced a blogger to 10 years in jail and 1000 lashes just for setting up a blog, calling for a deep reform.  </TEXT>
