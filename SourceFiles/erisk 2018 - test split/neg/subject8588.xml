<TEXT> There hasnt been found yet a tribe or society built on the values of selfishness and cruelty. Of course, no such society will ever be found since the members of such a tribe or society would have over the centuries killed each other to extinction. Wasn't there love, compassion, patience and general goodness before Jesus? Thousands of people have been crucified throughout time. Think of the cross as a hangman's rope. https://m.facebook.com/Chicagofreethinker/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> It tasted good, a messy experience though..tomato sauce all up in my beard. Interestingly I came across this statement by Chuck Sudo on the Chicagoist about Ricobene's. "There are three to five places that make a better breaded steak than Ricobenes. I would recommend Gios Caf   Deli, home to the panini caprese on our best sandwiches list. Punkys Pizza   Pasta, with their motto if your last pizza was funky, call Punky, makes a great breaded steak. Freddies on 31st and Union makes a breaded steak sandwich that rivals Ricobenes in sheer gluttony. Check it out." </TEXT>

<TEXT> When it comes to the river, there are few simple answers. Yes, its a myth that the river is hopelessly polluted  the days of dumping raw sewage into the river are long gone. But, theres still a lot of bad stuff that makes it into the river without being treated. And ironically, that bad stuff comes directly out of our water treatment plants.

Disinfection of the water discharged from our water treatment plants is the next step in making the Chicago River even cleaner. Even healthier. And unless certain agencies follow through on that next step, the river and all of its related waterways will continue to run with a lot of untreated toilet water. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought it rare to even know of such a creature, even smiling at the surrealistic statement that "oars do come in pairs". 

Just found out that the oarfish is also called 'king of herrings'   though rarely seen in the wild, their numbers are thought to be abundant enough that they are currently not considered to be endangered.

<TEXT> Online Education in India:- Education is a process of teaching or learning or says it is acquiring knowledge from individual or from institutional bodies. The process of learning starts from the birth itself and it ends with the death. The means of education are changed time to time. In old days there were Gukuls or Ashrams. The scholars were supposed to stay there for their education, as the time keeps change the methods of education also changed. Gukuls or Ashrams altered to schools and colleges.

In this modern age of computer and internet the ways of education are again modified to online education. Online education is different from traditional education methods because to get on line education students need not to visit an actual classroom and listen to teacher or instructor face-to-face. Online education is also known as distance learning or e-learning. No class rooms, no Schools, colleges required or say online education is a classroom without walls.

In the past, working people werent able to attain the education to further their jobs or careers because of time restraints; they could do only one thing at one time : job else education including, but not limited to, working overtime, business travel, and caring for families. But this new approach of education, I mean online education, wonderfully takes away those time restraints by offering a completely virtual learning experience. More importantly by virtue of online education, by attending courses that primarily take place over the Internet, working adults can now further their education, get higher degrees, and they can earn more money.

Online Education in India: -

Online education is proved like anything to a learner or scholar; its about students convenience. Now they are not supposed to wait the college doors are open and shut, even they can sign in when their schedules permit, they can work on their assignments as per their priorities. To me Online Education means scholars no longer have to quit their jobs to attend lectures, they need not to take off from their work to earn a specific degree. The striking thing is freedom from traffic hours driving hazards or threats.

Different programs require different levels of computer and/or Internet knowledge. Therefore, it is vital students take the time to speak with potential instructors Computer application and Internet browsing are the two basic knowledge required for online education. One can start his course by just logging onto the Internet and can go through reading assignments, asking questions, and receiving instructor feedback. Some courses even required instructor, to explain the topics. Yes to me Online Education is effective. The Department of Education found that students taking online courses outperformed their peers in traditional classrooms.

So while traditional Methods Schools and Colleges will never fade away, but stillOnline Education in India institutions are growing in number and enrollments because they offer the working class a chance to advance in their careers, develop a higher level of personal confidence, and fulfill life-long dreams.

<TEXT> Its over. Everyone, it is OVER. We are done having the conversation about how we can prevent our daughters from getting raped. The new conversation we will now be having is how we can stop our boys from raping. I do realize that on rare occasions there are women rapists, but statistically, the facts are that more men commit rapes then women commit rapes. So we wont be having the discussion about how to keep our daughters from becoming rapists. I will be happy to have this discussion when groups of six women and girls brutally rape a man with a steel pipe. All we (and I mean we collectively) ever discuss is how we can keep our girls, ourselves, women, safe from rapists. I know I have discussed before how we need to teach our sons not to rape, but this new conversation is one we need to be having constantly. And I will say this until my mouth is sore and my fingers fall off: We need to teach our boys how not to rape.

I dont want to hear any more vaguely worded rape-shaming about how a girl could have minimized her chances of being raped. I do not care, and please, this is important, so please read carefully: I do not care how drunk a woman or girl was. She does not deserve to be raped. I do not care what a woman or girl was wearing. I do not care if Juicy Couture or Victorias Secret comes out with a new line of sweatpants with the words Rape Me emblazoned on the ass and a female person buys and wears these, she does not deserve to be raped. I do not care if a girl or woman has consensual sex with a man, changes her mind mid-coitus and says no, she does not deserve to be raped. I do not care how many dark alleys she walks down, how many bad parts of town she frequents, how sexually active she is, how much makeup she wears, the length of her hemline, she does not deserve to be raped. There is never an excuse, or reason, or justification for rape. Ever.

Responsible parents can speak to their daughters about how to minimize their chances of being raped. But the greater conversation we need to have is how to stop men and boys from raping. We have had years, and years, and years of rape prevention seminars for women, of safety tips and classes, of helpful hints so you dont end up beaten and left in an alley somewhere after being sexually assaulted. We need the same sort of seminars, and pamphlets, and websites dedicated to teaching boys how not to rape. We need male politicians, and celebrities and athletes to do PSAs about how not to rape. We need fathers to talk to their sons about not raping. Women? We do this. We talk about rape, we are vocal about rape, we write about rape and protest rape and donate money to anti-rape organizations and write letters to get stricter rape laws passed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Get high!! The weekend is upon us, and what better way is there to enjoy it than to cook or bake some of your favorite takeout treats? Think of how much money you will save by whipping up these lovely recipes instead of paying out all the big bucks to the fast-food chains. So, here it is: the top 10 secret recipes!

1. McDonalds Big Mac
Sauce
1/4 cup Miracle Whip
1/4 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons french salad dressing
1/2 tablespoon sweet relish
2 teaspooons dill pickle relish
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon dried, minced onion
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1 teaspoon ketchup
1/8 teaspoon salt

The Rest
1 regular sized sesame seed bun
1 regular sized plain bun
2 beef patties (2 ounces each flattened to bun size)
2 tablespoons Big Mac sauce
2 teaspoons reconstituted onions
1 slice real American cheese
2 hamburger pickle slices
1/4 cup shredded lettuce

To make the sauce, mix together all the ingredients about one hour before using.

To assemble:
Discard the crown half of the regular bun, retaining the heel. Toast both sides of the heel and the inner sides of the sesame bun. Cook the two-all-beef-patties just like regular burgers. After the bun parts are toasted, put 1 tablespoon of sauce on each of the heels (toasted side). Then add 1/8 cup shredded lettuce to each. On the true bottom bun, place one thin slice of American cheese on top of the lettuce. On the extra heel, the middle bun, place two pickle slices on top of the lettuce. When the meat patties are done, place them one at a time on both prepared buns. Stack the middle bun on top of the bottom bun, and put the crown on top.

2. KFC Coleslaw
8	 cups finely diced cabbage	 (about 1 head)
1/4	 cup diced carrots
2	 tablespoons minced onions
1/3	 cup granulated sugar
1/2	 teaspoon salt
1/8	 teaspoon pepper
1/4	 cup milk
1/2	 cup mayonnaise
1/4	 cup buttermilk
1 1/2	 tablespoons white vinegar
2 1/2	 tablespoons lemon juice

1. Cabbage and carrots must be finely diced.
2. Pour cabbage and carrot mixture into large bowl and stir in minced onions.
3. Using regular blade on food processor process remaining ingredients until smooth.
4. Pour over vegetable mixture and mix thoroughly.
5. Cover bowl and refrigerate several hours or overnight before serving.

3. KFC Chicken
4	 chicken leg quarters
3/4	 cup flour
1	 tablespoon salt
1	 tablespoon pepper
2	 teaspoons MSG
1 1/2	 teaspoons paprika

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Cut chicken into 8 pieces(4 legs and 4 thighs).
3. In a zip lock bag mix all dry ingredients.
4. Moisten chicken.
5. Put one or two pieces of chicken at a time into the bag and shake well.
6. Then put chicken pieces on an oiled pan. Use Canola or Peanut oil so your chicken will not stick.
7. Bake approximately 40-50 minutes until chicken is done. Half way through baking spoon oil from pan on chicken to brown properly.

So much for the secrets herbs and spices!

4. Coca-Cola
1. Mix 2,400 grams of sugar with just enough water to dissolve (high-fructose corn syrup may be substituted for half the sugar).
2. Add 37 grams of caramel, 3.1 grams of caffeine, and 11 grams of phosphoric acid.
3. Extract the cocaine from 1.1 grams of coca leaf (Truxillo growth of coca preferred) with toluol; dry the cocaine extract.
4. Soak the coca leaves and kola nuts (both finely powdered; 0.37 gram of kola nuts) in 22 grams of 20 percent alcohol.
5. California white wine fortified to 20 percent strength was used as the soaking solution circa 1909, but Coca-Cola may have switched to a simple water/alcohol mixture.
6. After soaking, discard the coca and kola and add the liquid to the syrup.
7. Add 30 grams of lime juice (a former ingredient, evidently, that Coca-Cola now denies) or a substitute such as a water solution of citric acid and sodium citrate at lime-juice strength.
8. Mix together 0.88 gram of lemon oil, 0.47 gram of orange oil, 0.20 gram of cassia (Chinese cinnamon) oil. 0.07 gram of nutmeg oil, and, if desired, traces of coriander, lavender, and neroli oils, and add to 4.9 grams of 95 percent alcohol.
9. Shake.
10. Add 2.7 grams of water to the alcohol/oil mixture and let stand for twenty-four hours at about 60 F (15.5 C). A cloudy layer will separate.
11. Take off the clear part of the liquid only and add the syrup.
12. Add 19 grams of glycerine (from vegetable source, not hog fat, so the drink can be sold to Jews and Muslims who observe their respective religions dietary restrictions) and 1.5 grams of vanilla extract.
13. Add water (treated with chlorine) to make 1 gallon of syrup.

<TEXT> My mom's best friend has been with the same man for about twelve years. About a year ago his daughter had to come live with them because her mother went to jail. She is avery troubled young girl, always causing problems and stuff.

Well, the other day my mom's best friend and her boyfriend were out. They were nearly home when his daughter called and asked, "Daddy, how long are y'all gonna be?"

He lied to his daughter and said they'd be a while because he wanted to find out why she was calling to ask that.

When they walked in the door the girl was sitting right there in their dining room, wearing only a t-shirt, her legs spread wide open, ************ to the **** as it was blasting from the computer speakers.

She jumped up and ran out of the room and left the **** going! She put on pants and came out and turned the **** off!

<TEXT> You should of left that CARP onshore and let it die!! The Asian carp, a filter fish known to consume one-third of its body weight in a day, has found its way to the doorstep of Lake Michigan, which environmentalists say spells disaster for the Great Lakes ecosystem and threatens to destroy the $7 billion in recreational fishing and tourism revenue generated each year.

"Stopping the Asian carp invasion is perhaps the biggest ecological challenge of our generation," says Jennifer Nalbone of Great Lakes United, a coalition of advocacy groups dedicated to protecting the Great Lakes.

In December, a single Asian carp was discovered about six miles from Lake Michigan's Chicago shoreline. Since then, Illinois has come under criticism from neighboring states, which say Illinois and federal lawmakers are not doing enough to stop the invasion.

Michigan, which is leading a lawsuit, wants Illinois to immediately close the O'Brien Lock and Dam in the Calumet-Sag Channel and the Chicago Controlling Works in the Illinois River. The idea is to prevent the fish from entering Lake Michigan.

In January, the US Supreme Court denied a petition to seal off the lake. On the same day, the US Army Corps of Engineers discovered DNA that showed Asian carp had already breached the locks and were in Lake Michigan waters.

Stopping further reproduction has become a hot-button issue, prompting Michigan and a coalition of five states to petition the high court to reconsider its position.

The White House got involved in February, issuing a framework plan for preventing the fish from infiltrating the Great Lakes and committing $475 million to back it up. The plan calls for building an additional electric barrier and restoring wetlands while continuing to research the problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a story that's been playing out on Facebook and Twitter with growing frequency among friends, family members, colleagues and acquaintances as an already contentious presidential campaign between Romney and President Barack Obama enters its final, frenzied weeks. Your close friends may share your political views, but that eccentric uncle, former co-worker or high school classmate may not.
Nearly one-fifth of people admit to blocking, unfriending or hiding someone on social media over political postings, according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center's Internet   American Life Project. The biggest gripes: The offending person posted too often about politics, disagreed with others' updates, or bothered mutual friends with partisan political postings. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is your life. Do what you love, and do it often. If you dont like something, change it. If you dont like your job, quit. If you dont have enough time, stop watching TV. If you are looking for the love of your life, stop. They will be waiting for you when you start doing things you love. Stop analyzing. All emotions are beautiful. When you eat, appreciate every last bite. Life is simple. Open your mind, arms, and heart to new things and people. We are united in our differences. Ask the next person you see what their passion is and share your inspiring dream with them. Travel often; getting lost will help you find yourself. Some opportunities only come once, seize them. Life is about the people you meet, and the things you create with them, so go out and start creating. Life is short. Live your dream and share your passion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ugadi marks the first day of the new year, it's the first day of Chaitra which is the first month of the Indian calendar (Panchanga). This day is marked by symbolic eating of a specific mixture of six tastes called Ugadi Pachhadi in Telugu and Bevu-Bella in Kannada which symbolizes the fact that life is a mixture of different experiences (sadness, happiness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise), which should be accepted together and with equanimity through the New Year. While the people of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh use the term Yugadi/Ugadi for their New Year's festival, the people of Maharashtra term the same festival, observed on the same day, Gudi Padwa (Marathi:  ). Marwari, people of Rajasthan celebrate the same day as their new year day Thapna. Sindhis, people from Sindh, celebrate the same day as their New Year day Cheti Chand. Manipuris also celebrate their New Year (Sajibu Cheiraoba) on the same day. It is observed as Baisakhi in Punjab and Puthandu in Tamil Nadu. It is also celebrated in Mauritius.

It's unreal but it can be found at every 7/11 store the company is called N-Joy. The starter kit with charger and everything u need will be $19. Refills are damn cheap. I living in Chicago paid $16 a day for 2 packs. I've only spent the $19 for the past 5 days. I never thought I could quit, the E-Cig proved me wrong!!! </TEXT>
