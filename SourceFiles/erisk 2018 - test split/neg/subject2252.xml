I've read like 40 papers in the last two month, some working papers, others published in magazines, every single one of them in justified text.

<TITLE> Why Nolan is a treasure of modern cinema but still underappreciated </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 09:44:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Christopher Nolan is the best director in cinema history. He isn't as popular as Spielberg/Scorsese because his films are intellectual and witty. Unfortunately people enjoy mindless action with weak stories more than Nolan's thought provoking work. Unless there is a revival of intellectualism in American cinema: weak, unthought provoking films will continue to be drooled over by you so called "movie reviewers". The Prestige and Memento alone are better than any film Spielberg has made, so don't get me started on The Dark Knight Rises and Interstellar. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Care to give examples for anime that managed to capture this demographic? Also aren't a lot of the SoL shows (K-On, Non Non Biyori, etc.) made with an older audience in mind? As for US cartoons, I feel like theyre often deliberately trying to look "adult", e.g. by being unnecessarily offensive and over the top (e.g. Family Guy, South Park). Anime is often less in your face about that stuff and does not try as hard to look "adult" even when its the target demographic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks, that's quite interesting. So is this a problem with streaming sites in general or do official ones, e.g. Funimation, offer a better quality? 

 Most shows do not air on TV in 1080p. They air in 720p or a slightly larger resolution. The BDs are in 1080p, but are not put on streaming sites.

So the only way to watch a show in the highest quality available is to either download it or to buy the BDs? That's stupid, especially considering how ridiculously expensive they are </TEXT>

<TEXT> I honestly can't stand most of the popular stuff. I'm talking about things like the Spiderman Franchise, Guardians of the Galaxy, the Nolan Batman films (Nolan in general really). I don't dislike them because of their inherent flaws, and they do have plenty of those, believe me, but because they are popular with the common man. And I think that's the point really, because the average man does not value great art, William Gaddis said so too in Agape Agape. That's why the popular taste and the taste of those of us who value art must fundamentally differ.

I'll make one exception though. I do love K-On, it's popular but still great, an anomaly, really.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The literary brilliance of "The Room" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-05 02:32:43 </DATE>

<TEXT> so you probably all know the scene where Johnny asks Mark "Anyway, how's your sex-life?" which seems weirdly out of place. The interesting thing about that is though that it's a direct quote from the J.D. Salinger novel "The Catcher in the Rye" taken from a bar-conversation Holden Cauflield has with an intellectual "friend" of his who can't really be bothered talking to him and Holden asks him "How's your sex-life?" exactly as Johnny does in this scene. 

So my interpretation of this scene is now that Johnny is secretly trying to tell Mark that he knows that he's a phony, that he knows about his affair with Lisa, simply by asking this little question. Johnny probably sees himself as Holden in this scene, a lone fighter for what is right who is surrounded by phonies like Mark who act nice to him but betray him when he is not around. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was reading TCITR the other day and then it hit me, the guys he calls phonies, those are people like most of the guys here. Posers, who only read a novel to be able to say they've read it, that's why lots of people here have lists of novels to read, that's why Infinite Jest is such a popular recommendation. Most people here don't care about the art, they want a sticker in their notebook, a cookie and a pat on the back that says "well done".

I don't think you can have too many opinions really. Nowadays everyone just repeats what they read on social media platforms so it's nice to be able to think and reason for yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Listen, all these highschool american novels, e.g. How to kill a mockingbird, Catcher in the rye, Lord of the flies, and all American novels that are loved by Americans in general suck.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I feel like girls just like to listen to what's currently popular. They don't actually care about the quality or the meaning of the songs. That's why guys with a highly evolved taste like myself have it so hard. Have you ever known a girl who was into Webern? Me neither. Only a few people like myself and Glenn Gould can really appreciate him. But it's the same with non-classical music as well, girls just can't appreciate good artists: Warren Zevon, Tom Waits, Nick Drake, Jeff Mangum, all infamous for being hated by girls all over the globe.

<TEXT> I'm not really that much into anime, but most of my friends are and whenever we hang out all they chat about are their waifus. So I thought I should get myself one so I can also contribute to the conversation, but I want a good one, so they can't say that I've picked a bad waifu, or that my waifu is trash. 

Is it okay to pick a waifu from a popular anime like Bulma from DBZ, or does the waifu have to be one of those smallish girls?
