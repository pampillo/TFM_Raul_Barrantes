<TEXT> Might have been the quickest I've ever read a book other than Of Mice and Men. I really liked it but I can't figure out why, and I can't find much discussion about it. For example, I think its really interesting that the second part of the book introduces a bunch of new characters out of nowhere, and then focuses mainly on them. And how "I Could Kill Somebody" never tells you who the narrator is, or how the situation ends.

Anyone wanna discuss it with me? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been meaning to ask this for a while now, so, thanks!

I do it for characters who I think we're perfectly casted (like Batman and Joker, Cyborg, Iron Man, Rocket Raccoon, etc). Other times, I have to make up my own (Dennis Quade is Hal Jordan, Donald Glover is Miles Morales, Jake Gyllenhall/Brad Pitt/stereotypical New Yorker/myself as the different personalities of Moon Knight, Bruce Campbell is any pulp or over the top character).

I'm having a hard time "casting" Hellboy (Ron Pearlman never did it for me), Dr. Doom (I always heard Christopher Lee, but Doom should have an Eastern European accent), Robotman (I'm thinking some Old Hollywood actor like James Dean, with his racing background), and Kitty.

Oddly enough, aside from MK, I hear myself when I read Negative Man and Reader. Not because I have a good voice for it, because I don't, but it just happens. </TEXT>

And I was gonna guess Subz would be in this one since Scorpion was in the first and that's just how they do things, but I second guessed myself because Freeze and Captain Cold are already in the game. Guess I was wrong. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think just honest.

Having to deal with fanboys all the time would suck, especially if it's fanboys for a series you're not even that proud of.

Whereas most famous people seem really fake about loving their fans, Harrison Ford just seems like he's tired of it, which is a nice change of pace from the "I'm so humble" approach that many take just to sell the product and look good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> New to Hellboy but I've been wanting to get into the series for a long time. I've read Seed of Destruction and a couple of one shots, but those were a long time ago.

Anyway now I'm hooked, and ready for more. I've been thinking about just getting the trades because, for the main series, that's like $100. But if I went for the hardcovers (which I love the look of, and I buy probably 1/3 of my comics in that format), it would be *way* more expensive. Are there any cool bonuses that come with the library editions, or do the just look good on a shelf? </TEXT>

I'll probably get trades for a few Image books I've been wanting to read (Head Lopper, Seven to Eternity, etc) because my LCS is having a 25% off everything sale.

A bit later in the day I'll hopefully be getting Steve Leiber to sign my copy of The Fix #1, and Joshua Williamson to sign The Flash #21 at a different TFAW location. </TEXT>

Then again he's one of my favorite writers so I might be a bit biased. </TEXT>

Regardless, this a really dumb argument because the movies wouldn't have been PG-13 anyway, unless, like a lot of movies, they were altered specifically to get that rating. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've never worked in or owned a comic shop, but there are two things I can suggest in regards to pull lists.

Like someone else said, a discount for pulling more books is awesome. I get so many more books than I normally would because it gets me a nice 20% discount.

Anorher thing that I haven't seen anyone say is offer a discount for charging people's cards when the comics are put in the box. So Tommy might only come in once every two weeks for his comics. That can hurt owners by having to wait to get paid. So instead, give people ~5% off as an incentive to let you take their card info, and charge the remotely on Wednesdays. It's a win win. My shop does that and it makes me feel good knowing I'm not hurting the shop just because I can only afford to make it in once every two weeks or so, usually. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Got a couple new games for my group, and we tried them out on Saturday. We're pretty new to board games (aside from the classic ones, we've pretty much only played Dead of Winter and Betrayal at House on the Hill), so it was interesting to play three wildly different games.

The Voting Game was kind of fun. It's not much of a game, though, as much as it was a catalyst to start discussion and storytelling. Or maybe we played it wrong.

The Oregon Trail was...interesting. it was $10 at Target so I figured I'd try it. By that point in the night there were only three of us playing, and we got about halfway before we were all dead. Seemed like there's not much skill or strategy involved, which is kind of a turn off. I'll have to try it again.

The last game of the night was Love Letter. It was a hard sell, but after I used the guard and guessed that my friend had the princess as the first turn of a round, we started having a blast. So much metagaming. At $10, probably the second best game I've played in terms of band for your buck. First is Betrayal because it was like $25 and I've already played that for like 10 hours. </TEXT>

Not Doctor Doom, but the one shot based on the game.

It's the most insane comic I've ever read, and I only got to read it because there was a digital scan that someone voiced over and put on YouTube.

I have no idea where I would even find it.

Edit: a physical copy, I mean. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They downvoted because people are dicks and this might oppose what they think.

The top comment says it would be him basically because his stuff makes the most money. How much merchandise do you think Luke sells compared to Darth Vader? Yoda? Chewie?

If you think about impact, legacy, importance in the universe, similarity to the most archetypical hero, etc, it's definitely Superman. The DC universe seems like, in a way, it kind of revolves around Superman. For example, look at Red Son. He lands in a different part of the world, and the entire world is completely different. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've never understood this relating o or identifying with characters thing.

I'm a straight white American guy, so there should be a ton of characters I can relate to, right? Seeing as there's a ton of characters like this, there's probably some who I've had similar experiences to.

But I don't identify with any of them.

That's not because they happen to have superpowers, or don't struggle with the same things I do, or have different values. Even if there was a guy who lived on Earth 616 who was just like me, I wouldn't identify with him. He would just be a character in a story.

I'm not criticising wanting to be represented in comics, and I like that more and more people are able to find characters they relate to. But I just don't get it. It's hard to articulate what I mean, but if anyone can explain how they relate to characters or what that even means (other than, "I know what that's like"), I would appreciate it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently got the Apocalypse Now steelbook and it is fucking great. Really good transfer, both versions of the movie, the Hearts of Darkness documentary, and 9+ hours of other special features.

I had no idea. I just got it because it's one of my favorite movies and I thought it was a cool case at a good price.

I've been looking at some other though, and I'd rather have special features than nice packaging (usually). So for example, Heat has a new release coming, but also a steelbook. Is there a way to know what SFs come on it? The distribution stuff is confusing to me. </TEXT>

The best part of sexy stuff for me (and I imagine a lot of other people) is getting my lady off. Plus, cuddling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't see any mention about a counterweight or how big the "tray" is.

On the back of the arm near where it's connected to the rest of the turntable, I'd there a little circular dial? That would be an adjustable counterweight, which prevents the arm from pressing down on the record too hard. If that happens it slowly degrades the quality of the sound, which you may or may not notice for a while, depending on your speakers, preamp, or if you're an audiophile. Also, if may have a decent counterweight without the adjustable dial, I just don't see those often in new players.

The size of the "tray" (put in quotes because I've never actually known the true name for it) where the record actually sits is also somewhat important. If the record hangs off more than about an inch and the counterweight isn't damn near perfect, that can warp the record.

I didn't see either of those specs listed on the page, and it may very well have them. If you're using other speakers and those specs are met, I don't see anything wrong with it. Affordable sound systems have really gone up in quality since I started in the hobby a few years ago, apparently.

If you're not super concerned with the condition of your records and don't need that "perfect sound", you should be fine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of things. Built in speaker? The sound is gonna vibrate the arm and that's gonna scratch the grooves, reducing the quality. Built in needle? It's gonna get dull and if you can't replace it, the bluntness is also gonna mess it up. There are a lot of factors, if you send me a link to what one you have, I can look at it and see if there's anything glaringly wrong. </TEXT>

And yeah, for the general person, life is gonna be a bit less mundane, but everyone in the Marvel universe is so used to superheroes, it doesn't really matter to them anymore. </TEXT>

Also somewhat unrelated, but that guy is what made me consider nihilism. Like on one hand he did some of the most disgusting, evil shit I've ever read about. But on the other, he was legitimately mentally ill and if I remember it correctly, he didn't know what he was doing was wrong. So was he a bad person? Or does morality even exist?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A few hours ago I was doing some MC work and we had sone several jobs, fairly smoothly. It was pretty fun as jobs aren't usually that good with randos.

At one point, me and one of the other guys were having a skirmish with two other players not in the crew, out in the open hills. All well and good, they were trying to get the cargo.

Then some guy started sniping all of us. No one could get him back since as soon as we would spawn, we'd be shot because he had the high ground, good aim, and a lot of ammo.

The mission ended. He continued to kill us for no reason. I can't imagine killing players who can't really fight back is fun. I had to quit because there was literally nothing else I could do.

There went my crew.

Anyway I guess that was sort of a rant, but I want to know the point. Are you people just cunts or is there something you get out of it? I might have missed something as I haven't played since my 360 days, until recently.

Edit: So this game's for idiots. Got it. </TEXT>

And while I'm asking questions, is there a way to view multiple series' issues at once? Like having the concurrent runs by Hickman open at the same time so I could go in publishing order? </TEXT>

<TEXT> In terms of solely the amount of good stuff, I'd agree.

Episode I had the posters, Darth Maul, and Dance of the Fates.

Episode II had Coruscant, the arena (fuck you I liked it), Natalie Portman in a cut off shirt, Republic Commando: the movie, and Christopher Lee as Dooku.

Episode III had a shitload of large scale battles, Previous, **WOOKIES**, Obi Wan's best story, "dewit", and the Palatine speech.

However, I'd say the amount of shitiness peaked in Episode II so it kind of depends on the metric you use to gauge the movie's worth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kind of both.

There really isn't much else like Lovecraft's work. It's a special kind of feeling you get when you read it, and I think the elements that make that so would lend themselves to board game mechanics well.

Then again, the aesthetic of the mythos is something I've always loved. The almost noir-ish atmosphere set against the backdrop of a vaguely Victorian Massachusetts is fascinating to me.

I guess I'd just expect solid storytelling (in as much as a board game can offer) with smooth, investigative and survival elements. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [WSIG] Looking for the best Lovecraftian board game. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-08 00:53:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Right now, I'm trying to decide between Mansions of Madness, Eldritch Horror, Arkham Horror, and Elder Sign. I'm really interested in trying one of these out, but they all seem kind of similar. They're also not very cheap so they makes it a bit more important to find the right one so I don't waste a lot of money.

Mansions of Madness - This one seems the most unique of the four. I like games with miniatures and it seems the most like a horror story, seeing as you're only exploring a house. Also seems the most true to Lovecraft's writing. The only things that make me hesitant about it are the amount of replayability (four base scenarios seems like four playthroughs? I know there are expansions but still. Option for player made scenarios) and the cost. I have a gut feeling I'll like this the most.

Elder Sign - This one is half the cost of the next cheapest.

Arkham Horror - Seems the most complicated, and its the second most expensive. Not sure about even putting this one on the list.

Eldritch Horror - Seems like a condensed version of AH.

This is a real predicament for me. I've done research but the information I've gotten isn't helping. I'm really looking for theme, immersion, and solid gameplay. It seems that all fit this at least a bit.

The recommended template on the wiki isn't really helpful in this case, but I can tell you that my favorite board game is Betrayal at House on the Hill.

Sorry for the long ass post. I want to give the most information I can but I really don't know what exactly I'm looking for in these games, if you know what I mean? Like because they're all similar and I'm pretty open to whatever. So, pros and cons of the one(s) you've played? </TEXT>

<TEXT> A collectible miniature type game (like HeroClix) but it would play like a board game. Essentially you can buy whatever "characters" you like, and then bring those to the game. It would be less like card gaming because it wouldn't just be a battle. Maybe something like Betrayal at House on the Hill, but with more character interaction.

Highly thematic, with preferably small "game world" (again like Betrayal, it's just a house, not a huge map) and a lot of replay value.

I've been thinking about this a lot lately and there's a lot more to it, and what I described actually sounds vague and lame, but in my head it's awesome. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was thinking about this in the theater. I don't think it'll work as well as the movies, considering one of the reasons the movie works so well is because the plot is simple and the action is so fast paced.

Comics, for the most part, don't capture movement as well as movies. Also, a comic that's action with a slim story isn't usually great.

I hope the Dynamite series is good because I love the movies, but I just don't see it working too well. </TEXT>

On the sci-fi side, Brian K Vaughan's Private Eye and We Stand on Guard might satisfy. </TEXT>

I like meats (pretty much the regular stuff minus fish), fruits, **bread**, raw vegetables, etc. Pretty much the regular stuff, excluding seafood. I can't really afford to be picky anyway haha.

<TEXT> Moved out a few months ago, and I've been living primarily on cereal, top ramen, Carnation Breakfast Essentials, and peanut butter sandwiches.

I can tell it's definitely starting to affect me.

I've never really shopped for groceries before, and I don't know a lot about nutrition.

My budget is fairly flexible but $50-100 is what I'm looking at realistically. There is a WinCo and Grocery Outlet near me so I can stretch that a bit. I have started working out again and I don't know if that changes what I'll be buying much but I figured it's probably good to know. Also I don't have much time for cooking anything very complex, not that I could if I did have the time.

I know this probably sounds like a tall order but I don't have a ton of options. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He could have at least acted like he cared about giving the movie a review rather than his opinion.

For example, I love Hot Rod. I know it isn't a "good movie", but I like it regardless. If I was going to review it, I wouldn't say its a great piece of cinema, I would acknowledge it for what it is. That's the point of a review. No one cares about some asshole on TV's opinion, they wanted to know what the movie is like. </TEXT>

The single shot battle rifles seem to be the best, as they seem to have higher DPSes and greater accuracy. Is that the case, or am I missing something?

Also, how do I craft decent guns? I have a bunch of blueprints but all the guns I can make are way worse than what I'm currently using. Is there a 'special ingredient" to increase the damage, accuracy, RoF, etc? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay the title is a bad joke, but I swear, this game is dominated by tanks. Admittedly, I just got the game last week, but I played a lot of BF3 and it wasn't like this. I feel like I win most mano a mano fights, but then a tank comes along and fucks my shit up. Even with the Engineer class, I'm powerless to the might of the Abrams.

I realize that its a tank vs man and the tank should usually come out on top, but there doesn't seem to be any alternative to death, pretty much ever.

Is there something I should be doing to increase my survivability, or is everyone doomed when they encounter an enemy tank? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not the guy you responded to, but did you think it was scary at all? I can kind of get that being the reason you like it, but that's about it.

Legitimate question for you since you know about the subject. It seemed like it was barely about witches, and more about paranoia and the [devil](#spoiler). The witches only did a few things, and [the goat](#spoiler) seemed to be the main antagonist. If I'm not wrong (which I could be, I'm not the one with extensive knowledge on witchcraft), why did the movie resonate with you so much? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm starting a long process of reading a lot of characters I haven't read much of over the years, and I'm also trying to read most of the events in order. I know there's the FAQ but, in order to keep the cost low(er) and save some time, I'm probably only gonna read one or two arcs for most characters, so I'm trying to get a feel for the best of the best. I need suggestions for:

- Spider-Man

- Beta Ray Bill

- Hulk

- Silver Surfer

- Nick Fury

- Vision and Scarlet Witch

- Rocket Raccoon

- Valkyrie

- Daredevil

- Avengers

- Black Panther

- Agents of Atlas

- Polaris

- D-Man

- She Hulk

- West Coast Avengers

- Thunderbolts

Aside from that, I'm also looking for:

- Best Claremont X-Men stories

- Best stories with or about Dr. Doom

- Good stories that feature Colossus and Nightcrawler being buds

- And Cyclop's story arc/evolution through the years

Already in my reading list:

- Pretty much all the large scale events (and a lot of their companion stories because I'm a masochist)

- Epic Collection Vol. 1 for FF, Iron Fist, and Power Man and Iron Fist

- Remender's Uncanny X-Force

- X-Men Legacy: Legion

- Frank Miller's Daredevil

- Superior Foes of Spider-Man

- Hickman's Fantastic Four

- Deadpool and Cable

- Marvel Zombies

-Planet Hulk and WWH

- Hawkeye by Matt Fraction

- Pretty much all Moon Knight

- Invincible Iron Man: My Monsters (it was a dollar)

- Tom King's Vision (got the second half left)

- Punisher: War Journal

- Old Man Logan

- Dr. Strange   Dr. Doom: Triumph   Torment

I plan on reading everything in the order that it was published with a few exceptions like  [this](http://i.imgur.com/N7OXfyI.jpg).

I know this probably seems kinda daunting but if you have any suggestions I would love to hear them. </TEXT>

Then you read it.

And then you decide you want more, so you look for more books in the series, but those are shit, so you look to other series. And then you discover more comics you like. And slowly but surely, you build a collection and hide it in your closet.

And if you're me, you spend a third of your rent money on books because it's black Friday and instocktrades has some bitchin deals and you have no self control. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Relatively new to movie collecting, and I've got some questions. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been buying DVDs forever, but I never considered it collecting until recently. Now I realize it's a bit more complicated than I expected. So, a few questions.

Is there a good way to know what movies have "special editions" of some sort? Most of my favorite recent movies have been by A24 like Green Room and Ex Machina, which I thought didn't have special editions but apparently Ex Machina has a steelbook. I would never have known if I hadn't accidentally stumbled upon it.

While on the topic of steelbooks, what's the point? I got the It Follows steelbook and it seemed like it was just a different case. I'm fine with that but I don't get why people like them so much, for the price, if they don't have any special extras or anything. I'm probably missing something there but the steelbook website didn't have much to say.

Is Criterion *always* the best edition?

Does anyone set up cooler movies so the cover is facing outward, to display the art? If so, can I get some pictures as a reference?

I've noticed a lot of newer movies have slipcovers that just look like the regular cover. What is the point?

Also it seems like most new movies have like barely any special features? The Nice Guys, Bone Tomahawk, and the Lobster are three off the top of my head. That's no fun, yo.

Other than Criterion and Steelbook, are there any other 'brands' I should be on the lookout for?

Thanks for your time, and sorry if these are dumb/common questions. </TEXT>

Personally, I like it because it has a lot of variety in characters, and the characters I like are done right. The art is really good, and I think the artist just changed, so you're in the clear there. Right now they're fighting the Hand and spoiler, I guess? The Hulk. Deadpool is pretty alright, it is Duggan writing, so mostly jokey character, but not the meme character he has become under other writers. </TEXT>

I never said anything about wanting to instantly understand everything in one viewing. There's just not much more to the movie than the plot (visuals and so on) so when its as difficult to "get" as MD, that's a pretty big piece.

Going back to Eraserhead, did I understand everything (or really anything) about that the first time I saw it? Hell no, but it was still really good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh man everything about Eraserhead is awesome. The visuals, style, "plot", etc.

I know a lot of things are similar with these movies, so it would seem like if I like Eraserhead so much, I should like MD. But everything was so more more well done in Eraserhead and it went with what it is, a surreal, almost abstract mind fuck of a movie. MD kind of had that going, but it seemed like it went out of its way to add bizarre stuff that isn't connect with the rest, and then there was too much plot for it to be THAT abstract, and a lot of the plot didn't even go anywhere.

To address the last point, about explanation is secondary, I guess it just seemed like Eraserhead didn't need to make sense to be awesome. I can watch that and be satisfied. But Mulholland Dr. just seems like it's reading the viewer with not making any sense, while seeming like it should. I dunno, it's hard to articulate when talking about this stuff. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not too lazy to read into the movie itself, understood a lot of the themes and symbolism, but that's not really saying much, considering how obvious they are.

I just don't think movies should have to rely entirely on abstract symbolism and etc, to be enjoyable. Might as well just read an essay at that point. </TEXT>

Top five movies are, in no particular order, Seven Samurai, Star Wars OT, Hot Rod, Apocalypse Now, and The Thing. Off the top of my head. There are probably some others that I'd put ahead of some of these but I don't have a top 5 ready all the time. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Scratched Mulholland Dr. off my list. Biggest waste of 2 and a half hours of my life? Maybe. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-05 08:49:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I loved Eraserhead and from what I've seen, Twin Peaks is good. So I went into Mulholland Dr. pretty excited.

Then I watched two and a half hours of some scenes that kind of formed a story, in a boring way. I haven't looked up "explanations" or anything for the movie, because a) I don't think you should have to do that, a movie should be somewhat  enjoyable without having to resort to having someone explaining all the convoluted minutia, and b) I really don't want to waste any more of my time on this movie (the irony of that isn't lost on me, I know I'm spending even more time writing this shitty rant).

Also, the apparently infamous diner scene was more disappointing than a cum filled twinkie. So many people have told me about how scary it is. All it was was a guy telling about a really vague dream, and it isn't like there was very much about that itself that was creepy. I love horror, so its not because it isn't some James Wan jump scare, there was just nothing creepy about it. And to top that off, the two characters in the scene had pretty much nothing to do with the rest of the plot.

You're going to call me an idiot, or say I don't understand film or whatever the hell, but I'm pretty sure its just a case of a seriously overrated movie that people read way too much into. Maybe someone could explain why they personally like it, and then I can stew on that and probably still hate the movie a lot but with a bit less gusto. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its not like the "introduction" movies really add to the plot. They introduce you to the characters. They're good if you like the characters, but you don't need to see them to understand the other movies.

Example: I never watched Ant Man. When he showed up in Civil War, I wasn't confused about who he was. Its not like his story is vital to the plot, its just additional info. </TEXT>

Also, were the sequels planned, or did they just make movie with a confusing ending and decide later to make sequels? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not saying I agree or disagree, but this was an odd comment to read, considering the usual sentiment here seems to be that three of the best action movies released in the past 15+ years are Dredd, Fury Road, and John Wick, which don't take a lot of time holding the audience's hand and establishing stuff. People like them because they pretty much just go right into the action with minimal set up.

I don't know which I agree with (if either), but it's just kinda weird to see. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was at a record store in in 2014 with a few friends, and I was just starting to really get into music. I asked one friend, who seems to know pretty much everything about music, for a cheap recommendation. He brought me a Kid A CD from the $2 shelf and I got it, having only ever heard Radiohead's most popular songs (Creep, Karma Police, etc).

A few days later, I was sitting at home and I decided to try this new album (I wasn't optimistic for some reason). I expected some alt. rock or grunge, but when Everything in its Right Place came on, that sweet, sweet synth melted my brain. I listened for a minute or so, then jumped off my bed, turned the light off, and just sat and listened to the album two or three times.

Kid A is still one of my favorite albums of all time, and if you're ever looking for something to listen to on a long night drive, I wholly recommend it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Way I see it is, for example, most Rebirth stuff is appreciated.  Most people like it, but there is a pretty large crowd who aren't fans. If this comes up (as it always seems to), people are usually understanding and these comments get a fair amount of respectful attention.

Whenever I see someone say anything about Tom King that isn't positive, people seem to get personally offended and those comments go straight to the bottom of the thread. </TEXT>

Brian, I just wanted to say it was awesome that you came up and introduced yourself to my friend and I, it was pretty unexpected and really cool of you.

My question is, at the show, Nikki was singing a song and everyone was supposed to shout at her to make her uncomfortable, I think? Do you get stage fright/are you shy, or was it just for the act?

Anyway, thanks for making such great music! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 19. Halloween as an older teenager kinda sucks. Too old to rick r treat, but too young to drink (legally). I'm looking for stuff for my friends and I to do leading up to and on Halloween.

We're gonna hit up EZ Orchards and Bauman's for sure, and probably some haunted houses (suggestions there?) when they start opening this next month. Other than that, I can't really think of much.

My mom was telling me about how they used to have Halloween themed dances around here in October (non school functions) that teens could go to but I don't think they still do that.

Do you know if there are gonna be any classic horror movies screened anywhere around? The Dallas Motor-Vu is playing Phantasm next weekend so there's that, but I haven't heard anything else. I know in the past, there was a zombie walk and CCT had a Halloween show, but I wouldn't know where to look for stuff like that. Also I think it would be fun to visit some "haunted" spots but I don't know if we're interesting enough to have any around here.

Any other ideas? And no need to suggest just going to a party Halloween night. I can drink whenever, but I want to do seasonal stuff. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am so goddamn pissed off right now. I'm playing story and I got to the part where you play as Supes and fight Aquaman. Up until now, I haven't died once in the story, and I can beat classic battles on hard. But now, I've been trying to beat this fucker for 2 hours and he is raping me so hard.

First, Superman isn't bad, but he isn't fast at all. On the other hand, Aquaman is crazy fast and has really good range. Aside from that, he keeps spamming that thing where he shanks you with the trident four thousand times and there's not a lot you can do about it.

I've tried literally everything I know how to do to beat him, but nothing is working. Spamming heat vision works on anyone else in the game (not that this is my main strategy or anything, I don't even play a lot of Superman, but every time I've tried it it works), but not him, apparently.

Did anyone else have this problem or am I just a colossal fucking idiot?

Edit: I'm just booted the game back up to start trying again. As soon as the match started he jumped over my punch and proceeded to do a 10 hit, 41% damage combo. Goddamn you to hell, Aquaman.

Edit 2: WHO FUCKED UR SHIT UP NOW U LIL BITCH Guys I just beat that son of a fish and it wasn't even that satisfying because that fishdick lovin bastard isn't even real goddamn it. So after about 2 and a half hours of fighting him I got to Doomsday and Superman and I beat both of them on the second try. Wtf Aquaman you weren't even preparing me for a bigger battle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mike Mignola was Mike Magnolia, then Mignolia, then Minolia, then Mignola with the G pronounced, and now its "Minola", which I think is correct?

I guess I just never really looked much at his name and just kinda assumed what it would be.

<TEXT> Normally, I'm the same way. However, Die Antwoord comes up in every goddamn discussion about modern music, and the whole thing is so full of shit. People talk about how artistic the group is, and if you don't like it you probably just "don't get it" which is just stupidly pretentious. Just because it doesn't follow the trends of other music doesn't mean its high art. If I covered a canvas with swastikas and the word 'fuck' and then threw up on it, people wouldn't say its a beautiful painting, so I don't see why Die Antwoord is given such high praise.

Not to mention how annoying the whole "fabricated weirdness for the sake of shock value" is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It doesn't have the spirit of the first one at all. The main character is just really annoying and never really does anything to redeem himself.

The secondary characters are mostly useless.

The turned John the Mod into a black metal head for some reason, and all of his lines are about "God's not real", which has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. They also turned the ladie's man guy (sorry, forgot his name) into a sleazeball and Bob is annoying as shit, as a ghost.

Most of the jokes are stale, there are several subplots that go no where, the music isn't up to snuff, and a lot of the story just didn't make much sense.

Plus there is a really cringey concert montage near the end of the movie that is pointless for the most part, is put together terribly, and seems like they were like "shit, out movie's only 50 minutes long, maybe we can elongate it with concert footage that doesn't matter?", And is clearly taken from multiple shows, rather than just one.

I could go on but I blocked a lot of that movie from my memory and my writing skills are pretty sub par right now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I assume the feeling around here is similar to that of /r/comicbooks where people generally dislike the whole event. However, for those of you reading, do any of you sympathize with CM? I feel like Civil War II is suffering from the same problem as the first, where one side is clearly in the right, this time being Tony's side.

Maybe its because of the books I'm reading, or maybe I just can't see it from the other side. But it does really seem like we're clearly supposed to be rooting for Tony. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Marvel: Dr. Doom, Cyclops, Spider-Man, Reader, and Moon Knight would be a horrible team. Doom and Cyclops would be fighting over the leadership role, with Spider-Man and maybe Reader trying to defuse the situation with humor. Moon Knight is off solving whatever the actual issue is.

DC: Green Arrow, the Joker, Batgirl, Martian Manhunter, and Constantine would be an even bigger mess. The Joker and Batgirl would be at each other's throats the whole time, probably only not fighting when someone is keeping them apart. I feel like Green Arrow and MM wouldn't get along too well if they were constantly working together, and Constantine would probably stir the shit.

I separate by universe because I can't choose just 5 and that makes it seem less silly. </TEXT>

Not that that makes it more understandable, but the double standard pisses me off. What does make it understandable, is the context of the **single time** he hit his wife. He was under a lot of pressure and crazy for a while, and she wouldn't leave him alone. And, immediately after he hit her, he apologized profusely and hugged her. And it never happened again.

Hell, Jim Shooter (I think) even said Pym's reputation as a wife beater was stupid. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A few years ago I noticed clicking whenever I moved my jaw. Didn't do anything about it.

Fast forward a couple months, and I'm at a friend's birthday party, paintball. We'd taken a break for lunch, and I opened wide, put a burger in my mouth...and couldn't bite. People were asking me why I was taking so long to take a bite, but I couldn't respond. I just held the burger partly inside my mouth and panicked. For a solid minute I couldn't do anything.

Finally my jaw relented and I got it to move. I took tiny biyes of everything for weeks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've really been wanting to watch this movie for a long time (I haven't seen it yet so please dont tell me anything about the movie itself) and normally if I want to see a movie I'll rent it but I know I'm gonna end up buying this one anyway. Thing is, even used copies on Amazon are pretty expensive, so I figured I might as well just buy the best version. I'm guessing it's the Criterion one? DVD only, please, no Blu-rays for me right now.

Also, can anyone tell me what Eraserhead 2000 is? I keep seeing copies of it online but I don't know what it is.

I struggled to enjoy the book myself after listening to that recording because I read it in that guy's voice and it just pissed me off. I finally got rid of that though, and now I love the book.

Also, I never read the Star Wars Legends book *Death Troopers* and I imagine I wouldn't enjoy it very much if I had read it. But the audiobook was actually really creepy, listening at night while really tired. </TEXT>

Most of the "complex" stuff people are citing are either

A) slightly nuanced things you should be able to figure out in a few matches, as with most games, or

B) meta-game bullshit than is complex in every game.

Fuck off, everyone. Sure, its a bit more complicated than Call of Duty 19 but don't act like we're playing Age of Empires 2 or Street  Fighter or something. </TEXT>

I'm going to try to keep this brief, but the thing that I hated most about that movie (other than existing and being what it is) was the thing the dumbass little kid says at the beginning. He says (and this is meant to be a serious fact) that there are more people alive now than there are dead people.

Who thought that would be good to put in the movie? Did someone just make that up and no one fact checked it? It only came out a few years ago, the internet was there for that very reason. </TEXT>

Also, I doubt they would bring the character into a series that kind of caters to families, but his voice and past would make him a really good fit for Slapstick in my mind. If Slapstick's too dark for a movie, put him in a Netflix show.

If neither of those work, he could be an Inhuman. Doesn't matter which, there's a fuckin million of them now anyway. </TEXT>

You guys seem to actually give a shit about the quality of the game (a patch made with player input just a few days after the game came out), own up to mistakes (I saw one of the devs apologizing to a guy who got a bit screwed over by the patch that broke his game), and are working on making the game playable before monetizing it, unlike just about every other beta/early access game on Steam. All this shows a lot of integrity, which I don't see a lot of in the industry lately.

I just wanted to say thanks, and I'm excited to see where the game goes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really wanted to like this movie when I watched it a few months ago. Not a fan of Spike Lee but it seemed like it would be good.


**Spoilers ahead**


But damn it, I can't. It was good until the climax. Everyone riots and destroys the pizzeria. Turturro's character was a shithead, yeah, but why was his family's business destroyed? It makes no sense.

My biggest problem with the movie though, is that, when asked whether the destruction of the restaurant was warranted or not, Lee said it doesn't matter either way, in the wake of Radio Rakeem's death. What? Yeah, it sucks, but does that mean another wrongdoing is now okay? Of course it doesn't. The message of the movie is really shitty and distracts from the enjoyable aspects of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes! Every time someone asks me why I didn't like CW all that much I point to the action sequences looking terrible, and they don't understand why that would be a big deal.

I mean there were other flaws in the movie, but that one bugged me the most. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a horror fan as well as a western fan. We have a ton of great and original western movies, even in the past few years, long after westerns have seemed to fall out of favor.

However, we don't get a lot of good horror movies, let alone original ones. This movie, though, other than being great, was so...unexpected? I really did not see the movie going the way it did. They way the action just started so abruptly, and then just got so insane so quickly, felt perfect for the movie. Not a lot of movies do it that way. Also, the characters who survived weren't the ones I expected to, and really just the way everything ended up didn't seem contrived at all.

So personally, I'm glad we had a great horror movie, rather than a great western, because great horror movies are more rare, especially nowadays. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I frequent both /r/music and /r/books. /r/music is definitely just a bunch of elitists who hate pop music unless it came out 25 years ago, jerking each other off about musical tastes. /r/books is actually really weird because it's probably the only subreddit I go to often where the users aren't constantly shitting on each other's likes and dislikes. I think its because a smaller crowd of people like reading books than watching movies and listening to music, so there's already some kind of elitism inherent in being there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh God I think it has to be a tie between the new Daniel Wan movie (surprise it's another Daniel Wan movie about a fucking haunting who could have guessed it, also he stole that opening "scare" from a short film) and Absolutely Fabulous: the Movie (Jesus Christ). I saw the trailer for that today and I've never said this about anything else, but I think that trailer gave me cancer.

Holy fuck, that was worse than the trailer for Hologram for the King. I almost walked out of Neon Demon because I couldn't stand that trailer anymore. No, I'm changing my answer to just that one. The James Wan one still looks terrible, but at least it just made me dislike him even more. But Absolutely Fabulous: The Trailer just made me hate some people I've never even heard of, and I don't know who to aim these emotions at because I don't know who deserves it and I am sure as hell not going to look it up.

Shit now I'm upset just thinking about it.

Edit: Okay I guess neither of these movies are really in production but they're not out yet so I'm leaving this comment here. </TEXT>

They start out insulting each other and its kind of vague whether they actually hate each other or if its just friendly insults but it seems more like the former. Then the bridge explodes and she catches his arm and saves him from falling to his death.

"I suppose you want me to say I've always loved you. But I don't. I really, **really** don't."

By the end of the game they're a little friendlier, but there's no indication of romance and they still insult each other. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I stopped reading anything current quite a while ago but now I'm back on board. I read two recent-ish issues, Civil War II #1 and Uncanny X-Men #1. Civil War says something about the mutants and inhumans having a beef (though maybe this is a longstanding thing, I've never been too into either), and in the X-Men issue, they talk about the terrigen mists killing most of the mutants?

Is there a series that follows/explains the beginning of this? I'm kind of lost and it seems really interesting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My prom is next week and I totally spaced on renting a tux. At this point, due to the rush fees I would have to pay to rent a tux, it won't be much more to just buy one. Anyone know where the best place to do this is? I'm looking for something relatively inexpensive but not shoddy.

And can anyone recommend a tailor? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's an iPod touch 3(I think). Headphones fit about halfway into the jack, and won't find all the way in. I've tried pushing really hard, and I've tried digging out lint with a safety pin. I've gotten tiny bits of fuzz out but nothing substantial. I can't see what's inside at all. I'm going to try compressed air tomorrow but I doubt that will work. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Discussion] Some issues aren't showing up on Midtown Comics and TFAW, anyone know why? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-01 04:51:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm trying to buy some comics on line for the first time (kind of) and I'm having difficulties. Some just won't show up. For example, I'm trying to get Paper Girls #4 and 5. However, when I search "paper girls" on TFAW, the only results are the TPB, #3, #5, and #6. If the other are just out of stock, I feel like it would say so.


Same goes for Midtown. TP, and 1,2,3, and 6. I know Midtown does still show out of stock issues, so I don't know why some aren't popping up at all.


Anyone know what this is? I guess I could be doing something wrong but I don't know what that could be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm setting up a pull list for the first time (normally I just go in and grab my books) and I'm looking at several new series. I did the math and holy shit, it's a lot more than I'm used to. So, what do you spend on average per month? Mostly I mean on your pull list but back stock and trades I guess, too.

Edit: Welp, I guess I'm not in too bad a shape after all. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is there a good explanation of Secret Wars for someone kind of new to Marvel? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-11 06:53:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I want to get into a few current Marvel series but I feel like I should know what happened with Secret Wars. Most of the stuff I've googled is either from before the event, during the event, or afterwards but with very little useful information. My current understanding is for some reason all of the universes got together and fought or something, and now they're all jumbled but it's also kinda like the New 52 reboot or something, but apparently that's incorrect.

I'm looking for a summary, the big changes, and the meta stuff like how it's going to affect my reading (if at all). Anyone know somewhere I can find all this stuff? Or, would anyone be kind enough to explain it here? Sorry, I know this must seem really lazy but I'm struggling a bit.

Edit: By extension, if there are any really good arcs I should read, I could use some pointers. I don't have a ton of excess cash right now so I can't read a lot, but I could probably get one or two series if they're necessary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love browsing through comic shops, but I've never really got the concept of getting the old back issues. Like what are the odds of finding something from a series you're collecting? Or is it not about that? I don't know, it just seems like the chances of finding something relevant to you is pretty low. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been playing for a couple of days now, and I'm *okay*. So I'm not greatest or anything, but I'm not the worst, either. However, the last probably 15 or so matches (more before that, but those weren't such huge streaks) I've played, my team got steamrolled. I'm not entirely devoid of blame because I'm not amazing at the game, but most of the time it's because either my teammates are incompetent to say the least, or the other team is Sofia Vergara-level stacked against us.

These aren't just regular losses, either. These are games where we might go the entire round without being able to leave the base. Even if it was just me being terrible, it wouldn't make sense that the entire fate of the game should rest on my skill. That might be cause for loss in a close game, but these aren't close games.

I'm not complaining right now, I'm just trying to show that I've thought this out and I'm not a whiny little turd. Is there some system I don't know about that puts players together of similar skill levels? It's not even ranked play. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How important do you think an author's "voice" is? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-16 05:47:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been writing a lot lately (mostly just as a hobby, I'm not planning on trying to publish anything) and it's got me thinking about the voices of different authors. It seems that most popular authors develop way of writing and stick to it. James Joyce used super complex language that makes it really difficult to read, whereas Hunter S. Thompson wrote news in a really personal way. Both of those contributed hugely to their voices.

So, as the title asks, how important is the author's voice? If it's nothing particularly interesting, how does that affect your enjoyment of the book? And how much would it affect your opinion of, let's say, your favorite author, if they changed their voice drastically from book to book (assuming it would stay at a consistent level of quality)? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I want to start reading current series but I'm not big on DC or Marvel, or really anything with a large shared universe. I started Papergirls recently, but that's about it.

Preferably nothing more than 2 or 3 months old because I hate buying multiple books of the same title at once. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Question] There is an "Absolute" edition of Preacher coming out next year. Is that going to contain all of Preacher? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-29 09:28:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [The book in question.](http://www.amazon.com/Absolute-Preacher-Vol-Garth-Ennis/dp/1401264417/ref=sr_1_3?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1448785117 sr=1-3 keywords=preacher+omnibus)

I thought Absolute editions was like DC's hardcover version of trades, but this thing is 736 pages long. I don't know if that would encompass the whole thing, because Preacher seems longer than that. Also, it says volume 1 but I'm holding out hope that it is the whole thing and even as I type this I realize I think I already know the answer Goddamn it.

I'm going to post this anyway and hope someone gives me an answer I like.

Sorry if this is obvious but I can't find much info on this online as it comes out in 8 months.

But, if it is the whole series, holy shit I'm excited. I've been holding off on buying my own copies (I loved the series when I borrowed it from a friend) because I figured they would re-release the trades for the show, but if I can buy the whole thing together, that's even better. </TEXT>

The background singers and parts of the guitar riff are making me think of the song and this is driving me crazy holy shit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lately I've had the hankering to do stuff. Normally when I'm with friends we just browse through record shops or go to Get Air or something. But I'm only going to be a kid for a little while longer (I'm 18 and just started my senior year) and I want some cool stories to tell when I'm older.

I remember there being a creepy old abandoned asylum or factory or something that my sister used to talk about sneaking into, but I don't remember what it was. That's the kind of stuff I'm looking for. Something maybe a little bit adventurous, or even slightly dangerous. The kind of things most adults don't do. Or maybe even something like really cheap concerts like those couple dollar admission house shows like I used to see in Portland. Something unique, I guess.

If it matters, we're not really into drugs. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Just watched the Horde, what the fuck was with the end? [spoilers] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-25 08:33:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, so up until the end, I was really liking the movie, mostly. I really didn't like Bola and Aurore, but I figured they would die pretty quickly so I wouldn't have to tolerate them too long. Then she pulled the gun on the one guy and killed him for defending himself(?). Then later on she says something rude about the main guy (sorry, the names are hard to remember), and the "antagonist" is like he just saved us, be grateful. She replies "I don't care." What the fuck? Why? It doesn't make any sense! He insulted her, what, once? And to top it off, she fucking executes the last guy because he did something bad BEFORE THE FUCKING APOCALYPSE. I'm all for revenge but he helped her multiple times, and he probably wasn't even the one who killed the guy anyway. Why! Why is she the lone survivor? She wasn't even a main character until the last half hour, and she didn't really do anything that would put her in the spotlight other than be a woman. Oh, sorry, I forgot, if there's one woman, she has to survive no matter how shitty of a character she is.

This leads to my bigger gripe which is horror movies being predictable, especially with who lives and dies (either pretty much no one in ghost movies or everyone except the innocent one in slasher movies), which effectively kills the scariness. It's not scary if you know what's going to happen, is it? Anyway, that's another post for another day. </TEXT>
