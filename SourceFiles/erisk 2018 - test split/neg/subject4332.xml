<TEXT> Each briquette is 25F so you would be applying 400F to the bottom of that oven. Typically I try to cook from the top down so yes I would think that would cause you issues.

However, of the oven on top is a smaller size then perhaps the coals outside of the 'directly underneath' the oven won't have the full impact.

Here is a link where someone stacks 3 and tells you how they do the coals:

<TEXT> A few tips to make things easier for people new to dutch ovens:

1. Using charcoal can make getting the temperature for a cook easier to obtain. Each coal represents approximately 25 degrees F. So when a recipe calls for a 350 degree bake you know you need 14 coals.

2. When placing coals, unless the recipe tells you otherwise it is best to put 2/3 of your coals on top of the oven and 1/3 under the oven. Placing too many coals under the oven will result in a burned meal.

I can add  more of this sort of stuff if anyone is interested in it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is a fun dessert - this is from: http://www.createdby-diane.com/2011/08/smore-cobbler.html

I've done this twice on camping trips - I just converted it for a dutch oven from her conventional oven recipe.

S'more Cobbler 

1 box chocolate cake mix

1 cup whole milk

1 5oz chocolate pudding (cook serve)

1/2 cup butter

6 whole graham crackers

1/2 cup mini chocolate chips

40 large marshmallows

Combine milk and pudding mix and place into greased dutch oven.

Place graham crackers (broken in half) on top of pudding mixture with space in between each one

Add 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips.

Spread DRY cake mix over top and place the butter by tablespoons on top of dry mixture.

Bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes (9 briquettes on top 5 under). 

Mix slightly so there isn't large areas of dry ingredients.

Add marshmallows and bake for 8-10 minutes and if needed 1-2 minutes with all coals on top to brown.  </TEXT>

Imagine if PA got into the legal pot sales business before NJ does. Instead of letting NJ get all the revenue from the casinos for decades before PA finally got with it - the reverse could happen... </TEXT>

<TEXT> EDIT - I looked through your reddit history and I see that you are into aquaponics - THAT could be part of your additional water usage if you are making large water changes, special filters ETC.

Still - see below...

I know this is old but I want to reply to it in case you are still dealing with this.  I've worked for several water companies in the past and poor customer service just pisses me off.

It is very easy to confirm if you have a leak in your home.  Locate your water meter and before you go to bed write down the reading on the odometer dial.  When you wake up in the morning take another reading.  If the reading is higher then you are using water somewhere in the house.

Many meters also have an indicator (a red triangle or similar shaped object) on the face of the meter.  It will spin even when a small amount of water is being used.  Even if it doesn't look like a toilet is leaking - it can be.  If you do see the triangle spinning or you are using water when you are sleeping then begin to turn off water to different devices in your home to eliminate the culprit.

Some things that can increase water consumption are:

RO filters - if you have one under your kitchen sink it will use additional water to filter what you get out of the tap.

Water softeners - one that is not working properly can cycle too often and use extra water it does not need to use.

Whole house humidifiers - if you have one it is possible that the needle valve that inserts water into your HVAC system is stuck open.

Many people have the drains for these devices routed to a sump pump.  Check your sump and see if any drains lead to it and if they have water flowing to them.

The average family of four people uses approximately 200-400 gallons of water a day.  Your usage is approximately 1,577 per day.

If they read your meter incorrectly initially then there will be a large correction to your bill the following cycle.

I'm assuming that WMWA is a water authority.  Unfortunately you don't have the amount of leverage you would have if your water company was regulated by the PA PUC.

One thing you can do is check and see what the prior consumption was for the prior owner.  If the meter on your property has an old style outside register (it will look like an odometer as well) the numbers on the outside should match the inside.  Sometimes they get off and when a house is sold the Authority will get an 'inside' reading.  This can cause for a large catch up bill as well.

Feel free to PM me if you need any further advice.  Hope you didn't get stuck with a big bill. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We took a peek at the new requirements and filled in the gaps to run the new Tiger program this year so no robbing from wolf and bear for us.

On my last go round with this pack as a DL I came to realize that the biggest thing Cubs can offer kids is access to the outdoors in a way that no other program does.  Gone are the days where kids would roam around their neighborhood with other kids after school.  A good 80%+ are now sitting in their houses connected to an Xbox or other electronic device.  They voice chat with their friends and never see their faces.

Gone is riding your bike, climbing a tree, all of the things we did as kids.    If we can give them an opportunity to get dirty, see nature up close and personal and get some healthy physical activity in - that's a win.

So our Pack and Den activities have a real outdoor bend to them.  On top of that we've seen the cubs that have the most total outdoor camping/cooking experience tend to have the easiest transition to the Troop. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my mind the Tiger program was just tacked onto the Cub Scout program and not really thought out in the same fashion as Wolf/Bear/Webelos was.  The only purpose it really serves is to get the boys in uniform a year earlier than they used to be.  It has always felt as if it was a reaction to the fact that kids were getting into soccer/tee ball/etc a year sooner so the BSA needed to ramp it up a notch to keep up.

The hard part is providing an engaging program that interests the boys.  I've had 3 boys in the Tiger program and it just doesn't have the heft that the other ranks do.  Maybe if I went through it just once it wouldn't be a big deal to me - I don't know.  Going through it three times and you start to see the weak points.

From what I've seen of the new Tiger program it appears to be much better.  Perhaps the same can be said of the Lion program.  I don't believe anyone in our district is running it yet.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe try to engage in rational constructive conversations with him instead of dismissing it as crazy when he brings up a topic? 

and

If he ever confronts you about it, tell him that you did what you thought was best at the time, he has every right to feel hurt and violated about it and you should definitely not dismiss it or try to belittle him if he brings that up . It could be devastating emotionally/psychologically and will only worsen your relationship. You don't seem to have thought this issue through at all considering what you've written.

We don't dismiss it.  We never dismiss anything he says as crazy.  We try to have a rational conversation to explain why we made the decision we did.  We see his concerns and questions as valid.  I get the hot button issue that circumcision is - we both do.  We lay out the reasons for why we made the decision.  The problem is in his response what he writes what he says etc.  It's totally over the top.  I see the pattern as to how his brain works now.  Take fluoride in our water, 9/11 was a setup by the US government.  Any of those things - as soon as he googles it and clicks on the first link - THAT is what he believes.  I guess I'm asking for help in how to give him the ability to not be sucked in immediately by the first thing he reads.

I really enjoyed it when I started reading philosophy so it might just interest him to do so, it also improved my grades in all other areas because I actually started to understand why I did things.

Thanks for this - I will look into introducing this to him.

Sorry for my English, it's not my native language.

No need to apologize, it is quite good.  Thanks for taking the time to respond to me.

<TEXT> This is probably going to be very long - I feel I need to give a lot of backstory in order to get the proper advice.  I'll put a TLDR at the end...

I'm a 45YO NT dad of a 14yo boy with Aspergers.  He was initially diagnosed as PDD-NOS when he was 3.  We've never hidden his diagnosis from him, have worked tirelessly to adapt our lives to him.  He has 4 NT siblings, 3 boys[16,13,7] 1 girl[4].  His mother (also NT), and I educated ourselves early on, realized that his autism is part of who he is and have never tried to 'cure' him in any way.  All of our efforts have been to help him learn his way through life so he can become a self sufficient functioning member of society - pretty much what anyone would want for any of their kids.  We both really love this kid and just want him to have the independent life he says he wants.

He has never been an easy going kid.  Very rigid, very black and white - the usual AS stuff.  He's gifted in mathematics, music and is also a very impressive writer.  Social skills he scores a big fat zero on.

Now that he has hit the teen years the tension level has climbed through the roof in our house.  I'll break it down into his homelife and school life:

Home life:

Relationships with siblings - If I had to guess, I would say that he has the emotional development of a 7-8 year old boy despite having the vocabulary and mental ability of someone in their early 20's (at least).  He is perfectly content to spend hours laying on the carpet playing make believe with Pokemon and his 4yo sisters dolls.  His 7yo brother and the 4yo sister love doing this with him.  Unfortunately he doesn't seem to be able to differentiate between what is appropriate to say to a 4yo/7yo and what is not.  This results in the 4yo getting distraught when her older brother starts to describe how the Pokemon are being gutted and killed etc.  I've spoken with him repeatedly about this, he assures me he understands that he can't talk like that around them - I have the exact same conversation with him the next day or so repeat repeat repeat....

He doesn't have much of a relationship with his siblings that are closer in age to him.  He won't invest the time necessary to learn or get into the stuff they are into.  I worry about what he is going to do when the younger 2 grow out of the toys he enjoys.

Relationships with parents - he does a lot of the typical teenage stuff - gets angry with us for controlling him etc.  However, now he gets stuck on topics that he stumbles upon/hears about and we can't rationalize with him like we can his brothers.  For example, and bear with me cause I know this can be a hot button issue - circumcision.  He was having issues with spontaneous erections which are normal for a 14yo boy.  He Googles it and learns about the anti-circ movement.  He becomes almost violently anti-circ.  He tells us we've raped him and taken away his precious foreskin.  I really thought a few times he was going to come across the table at me about it.  I'm fairly certain that if he was uncut he'd be demanding to be cut.  **It's almost like whatever he reads first on any controversial issue - THAT is what he becomes a proponent of.** He came downstairs one day and said to me 'Why do people hate the jews so much?' All I could think was if he read the right pages on the web I'd now be living with an anti-Israeli zealot.  He is a conspiracy theorists wet dream.

His mother in particular puts so much time, energy   love into trying to help him.  He really treats her like crap a lot of the time.  After a blow up he will come back and apologize but his whole mode of operation is really wearing her down.  She worries about what is going to happen to him when he turns 18, walks out the door and never looks back because frankly if something doesn't change for him - he is in big trouble.

I find him frustrating because he has a lot of potential but he gets so hung up with his way of thinking that he refuses to see the other side of the argument most of the time.


School:

He's had a classroom aide from the start and has fought tooth and nail since Jr. High to do eliminate the aide from his IEP.  He absolutely does not want his classmates to know that he is 'different'.  We've tried explaining that lots of people have aides, everyone is different, everyone has struggles.  He can't see that.

At the end of the last school year the teachers on his IEP team came to us and made a recommendation that he be moved to a different building.  He was in a school that had an emotional support program.  The other building has an autism support program.  They suggested this because he was being very negative to the members of his team and his grades were suffering significantly.  Based on their recommendation we agreed.

Unfortunately he hasn't taken to this level of support either.  All he wants is to be left without any aide or program.  The primary purpose of the aide is to help him focus and stay on task.  In classes where the aide is not present he forgets to turn in homework that is due, doesn't write down assignments, doesn't take good notes.  We spend hours and hours of extra time on him each week helping him study, looking over his work to see what he missed.  All we can think is he needs to learn to do this on his own

What caused me to write this today:

He's been writing us letters threatening us to make 'adult decisions' on his own if we don't move him back to the old school - we can't.  He writes horrible things to his mother and I in his room, absolutely hate filled screeds that no one that has given as much as we have of ourselves should have to see.  Then he will come downstairs and play with his younger siblings like nothing has happened.  Perhaps he is just blowing off steam but we don't believe we should just ignore these as that.

He demands to be left to handle his life/school/etc on his own.  His follow up to that sucks - it doesn't exist.  He wants to be able to just go on the internet and search for stuff on his own - anytime he does that we end up having another week or two of him ranting at us about some crazy half nuts website he found.

He's begun asking about searching for information about autism (what causes it, etc.) online.  I see this as a nightmare if we don't handle it right.  Seriously, god help me if he reads an anti-vaccination web page.  No, I don't believe it causes autism.

My questions:

Can anyone recommend some good websites/books/forums that would be a good jumping off point for him to look into?

Can anyone see anything that we are currently doing that if we changed how we handled it would perhaps help him have less of the teenage angst/rage we are seeing?

TLDR:

Love my son, having a lot of issues with him now that he is a teenager looking for advice and resources for both him and me that can help us out.  I'm sure I left some stuff out and will be happy to clarify.

<TEXT> One bit of advice I can give that worked on me when I was recruited and I have since used several times to recruit others is to do the following:

1. Identify your candidate - like others suggested ask your committee chair or other people in the pack for suggestions.

2. Meet with your candidate and the person that suggested them preferably outside of a normal cub scout setting. Two on one is ganging up but it works.

3.  Ask them to commit and layout exactly what you are expecting them to do.

4.  After you ask be quiet.  Wait to hear what they have to say.  A lot of times they will slowly talk themselves into it.

That's exactly how I became CM my first go round, how we found our last 3 CM before I took the job back over again.

With the den program laid out so well anymore it is easier to get people to commit.

With regards to your son's den, you have extra vested interest in that.  If your current DL can't schedule out maybe if you sit down with the other parents and plan you can run the den by committee - each parent takes one meeting a month in rotation.  Your current DL will do one meeting a month - you have approx. 18 meetings from September to May he will cover 9 so you need to cover 9.  How many other boys are in the den? Each parent can commit to running a meeting a month.  You will be there as the trained leader so you have that covered.  I wouldn't include you in running any of these meetings as you already have a position in the pack.

Good luck.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Den Leader, Fund Raising Chair   District Roundtable Commissioner?  Wow, your plate is full.

I've always tried very hard and not always successfully to limit myself to 1 or 2 roles max.  I have a pretty healthy distrust of the whole District/Council stuff so I won't bother commenting too much on that.

Anyway, when our pack struggled with volunteers in the past we tried the following with varying degrees of success:

Method One:

Set up the September pack meeting as a carnival, simple games that the kids love.  We are lucky in that the gym where we meet can be split in half.  We set up the games on one side hosted by Boy Scouts and 2 deep leadership.  On the parent side we set up a series of poster boards with the events of the year.  We then ask for people to sign up to help for 2 events.  This staffs your committees for events.  Then a registered leader takes charge of that event and has their manpower to get it done.

Method Two:

Assign the large events (camping, pinewood, blue and gold) by rank.  In our example we did the following:

Fall Campout (September) - Bear Den

Blue and Gold (February) - AoL Den

Pinewood Derby (March) - Wolf Den

Spring Campout - (May) - Webelos Den

Pack Picnic - (Early June) - Tigers

It takes a lot of the guesswork out, it removes the possibility of one person having to run the same event over and over and if you look at how it lays out it puts the Tigers in charge of an event that happens at the end of the year which gives them lots of time to get acclimated.

On a side note, hearing that the control freak is still your Treasurer is not surprising at all.  I've heard more stories of issues with that than just about any other.  At least in Cubs the parents tend to 'age out' like the kids do.  In Boy Scouts they can hang around for decades causing issues. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is your CM opposed to them?  I know that total control freaks exist, but for the most part when people are struggling and you offer help, they accept it.  Are you willing to schedule and run these committee/parents meetings?

How about a conversation like this:

Hey CM, it sucks about us not participating in that event, I'd like to help and make sure something like that doesn't happen again.  What days of the week would work best for you to schedule a monthly meeting to go over stuff like this and plan events?
--
Anytime a parent comes up to me to register a complaint about an activity - real or imagined, the very first thing I do is ask them to help out with the solution.  It can work in reverse as well.

If asking to assist doesn't pan out, then there must be bigger issues at play.

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I camped in the vicinity of Cherry Springs - at this campground [right outside of Coudersport](http://pottercountycamping.com/).  It was about 20 minutes to Cherry Springs by car.

The best bet is for you to call the park and talk to one of the rangers.  They offer a program during the year with a pretty hefty education program at night.

The park itself is split in half.  The main park has parking and a big field where astronomers can set up in a field.  When we went it was very cloudy so our views were poor.  Despite that there were 4-5 'pros' set up with rather large scopes in the field.  They were all very friendly and more than willing to talk to our kids about their gear.

On the other side of the park there is seating and an instructional area.  We did not go back for that part of the program as it rained on us.

There are tons of trails to hike.  There are a few rainy day things you can do as well.  The PA Grand Canyon is about 30 minutes from Cherry Springs.

They don't have a full blown visitors center. </TEXT>

I've stayed in State Parks that are remote and despite that I had rangers sneaking around watching us at night checking to make sure we had no alcohol - and we were quiet!

Many family camp grounds have large group sites that allow for people to cut loose...just call up and ask.  Good luck and have fun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is the [Webelos Cooking Academy](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B0Hso4Utz85pNmhXYWZxaTZsTUU usp=sharing) I mentioned in another thread.  It was written and designed by a very good friend of mine for a Wood Badge Ticket.

When we watched our oldest sons transition into Boy Scouts we were a bit stunned by how abrupt the change can be.  One of the biggest struggles we witnessed was camp cooking.  With the current program there wasn't a large focus on cooking.  Boys would cross over full of enthusiasm then do a nosedive on their first camp outs.  This program attempts to correct that issue.

Our pack has now crossed over 3 Dens into First Year Patrols using this program.  All three have had much higher retention rates than previous groups.  The SM and ASM all state that it is much easier to integrate these boys because they know their way around the camp kitchen.

If you happen to use the program please shoot me a message so I can let the author know about it.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Pack Meeting Idea: Sockwar </TITLE>

<TEXT> I'm getting ready for my second go round in Cub Scouts.  I held just about every position in the Pack last time so I'm starting off as Cub Master right off the bat this upcoming year.

When I was a Den Leader last each Den was responsible for the theme of a pack meeting.  Having a real been there done that feeling led me to find this idea:

[SOCK WAR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdfGddHDnso) - not my video, just a sample.

We had each family bring one package of white tube socks to the meeting.  We gathered a bunch of cardboard and a few rolls of duct tape.  While the parents rolled each of the pairs of socks into a ball the boys were split into 4 teams of diverse rank.  Then the Den Chiefs   other leaders worked with the boys to create forts using the cardboard and duct tape.  The socks were divided up into 4 bunches and distributed to the teams.  Then the war began.  We had 4 or 5 resets and had to calm a few boys down but for the most part it was a blast.  Afterwards we gathered all the socks and donated them to a local group that provides clothing to the needy.  You wouldn't believe how happy they were to get them! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The last time I did this was a few years ago.  Some things I was sure to do that I didn't see mentioned in the other responses:

1. Be sure to show everyone the first aid kit you have.  Review the procedure for cleaning and bandaging a cut.  I always joke with the boys that it's been a looong time since I performed first aid - so you probably don't want to be my first after such a long break.
2. Be very direct and strict.  Layout that if you see anyone not following directions they will be immediately removed from the training - this is your one and only warning.
3. Explain to the boys that even if you earn the chip - the parents still are the final decision as to whether or not you get or carry a knife.

Good luck!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah ok.  I know a lot of places will initially hire people and keep them in house.  Once they have proved themselves they begin to let them telecommute.  So you would need to tough it out initially, then slowly get the offsite position you want and need.  Even if that is something that your current employer can't do it is something to look for.  If you do decide to leave your current employer try to do it in the best fashion possible, that way they can be a reference for that job that does let you telecommute.

<TEXT> Just because we have the same circle of friends does not mean that we need to be friends.  I can more than see that you don't like me or my wife.  Yet, whenever we try to have a social event at our home you somehow manage to make us aware of your displeasure with not being invited because you can't stand to not be involved.

I've known you for 6 years now and from the very start your know-it-all attitude and total lack of discipline for your son has bothered me.  I felt bad for the kid and did my best as his Den Leader to try to help him learn to work in a group.  He was out of control, disrupted meetings, and ruined a lot of experiences for the other kids at times.  At the end of the Cub Scout program (5 years of that) I was exhausted.  Dealing with him was draining to say the least.

As hard as he was to deal with, it was you that really drove me nuts.  You act like you know everything.  You pay no attention to schedules or deadlines.  You never respond to emails.  your son was always unprepared.  You would miss submission dates for camping permit fees and then call me the day before and beg me to let him go.  Never mind that I had already bought food for the correct amount of people, gathered activity material for the expected number of people, never mind the inconvenience to me.  I would always cave because I didn't want him to miss an event.

My parents were involved with Cub Scouts and many of the friends they made during that time are people they are still friends with today in their 70s.  I understood this and wanted to make lasting friendships as well.  In our group were three or four families that I could see this happening with.  But not with you.

You managed to insert yourself into every outside of cubs activity.  You used the other families as Daycare for your son, dropping him off so you could run errands, go out to dinner etc.  The other families would complain about it - but they would put up with it.  Your son doesn't like my son, which is fine, different strokes for different folks and also fine because he never asked to come to our house - except when other kids were over.

My wife gathered a group of the Moms together to participate in a charity activity.  You were all in and committed.  Then the day before the event you text me and say 'Sorry I can't make it, forgot I was going to Disney tomorrow.'  Who the fuck forgets they are flying to another state to visit Disney?  No one does.  You are incredibly inconsiderate and nearly stuck us with the cost of your tickets.  If we hadn't hammered you for the money I'm sure you would have stiffed us for it.

At church our boys were completing the sacrament of penance.  The priest announced several times 'If an adult wants to go to confession, please wait until ALL of the children are finished.'  I stood with my son at the very end of a long line and watched you march right in, not waiting to spend 20 minutes in the confessional while children stood patiently and waited.  When you came out I thanked you for listening to the priest - you looked at me shocked and left.  It took me another 30 minutes of waiting for my son to complete the sacrament - thanks.

Now when we have family picnics and invite some people from that group of friends you try to insert yourself and your son into them.  It's our home, our get together, yet we feel pressured to invite you and your son.  We are generally nice people but we aren't going to be doormats - sorry.  We made the mistake last year of inviting you one time.  A normally great group of kids were suddenly wrestling and throwing things in my basement, yelling screaming.  I went downstairs three times to tell them to calm down.  It was your son causing the issue - this never happens otherwise.  Did you go downstairs? Nope.  You also managed to flat out ask me in front of 6 other people how much I paid for a home improvement.  I was so stunned I actually answered you - I can't believe you had the balls to ask that.  I should have countered by asking you how much you make a year.

The final straw happened this week.  Every year I plan a family camping trip.  I invite a large number of families from in and outside of the group you know.  In a prior year I invited your family and you never even bothered to respond to the invite.  This year I have 9 families attending.  Your son must have caught wind of the trip on the school bus and went home to hammer you about it.  Instead of explaining to him that you weren't invited and oh well you Facebook message me and ask 'Can we come too?'

I explained nicely that I have 9 families already booked and the site is at capacity.  I say 'I never imagined you sleeping in the woods!' as it is CLEARLY not your thing.

Your response is classic (and your typing and posting in emails and on Facebook is horrific, it drives me nuts):  

'I would of for my child not to be leg out. Plus I was there several times with g scouts.  Don't judge a book by its cover I would of surprised u. Thx.'

I would hope that your rude comment would be the end of our relationship - but it won't be, I know that.  As long as we have mutual friends you will continue to act this way.  I'm at the point now where I think I would rather cut off the friends I have made and make new ones than continue to deal with you.

The world does not revolve around you and your child.  I am not planning this trip in order to please you and your child.  I am doing this to have fun with my family and with people I enjoy being around.  I am not doing this to spend a weekend with a boy who will be incredibly disruptive and a woman who will only be there because she doesn't want her child left behind.  I want to be with people who WANT to be there.

Here is an idea:  you plan a trip, you select the camp, you select the site, you contact the camp to make sure they can handle a large group, you send out the email inviting everyone, you coordinate that, you collect the money for the deposit, you send out the list to every family with the gear you recommend they bring, you plan the menu, you do ALL of that.  Then your son won't be left out.

Don't bother to invite me though, I don't like you.  kthxbi </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's been at least 5 years since I've upgraded my current setup:

55G w/ 1 5yo adult velvet Oscar

Eheim canister filter - double loaded with bio media.
Gravel
2 rubber encased heaters
A few decorations that the Oscar hasn't been able to destroy.

I bought the Oscar on a whim with my son 5 years ago after keeping African cichlids for about 5 years before that.

I'm planning on moving my 55G and the Oscar to my office.

In its place I'm buying a used 90G.  I've had such great luck with the Eheim filter that I'm going to buy a new one that is sized correctly for the 90G.

My plan is to stock it as a community tank w/ Tetras and some (approx 5) angels and a pleco.

Since I haven't looked around a LFS in at least five years, what would you say is something that has really impressed you gear wise in the past year or two?  In particular I'm curious about:

Monitoring/automation technology - this was virtually non-existent or very expensive 5 years ago.  Has that changed?

Lighting - LED is available now, is there an overall best choice of manufacturers?  I see this: [LED light](http://www.thatpetplace.com/satellite-freshwater-led-strip-light-48in-60in)  anyone have good luck with that manufacturer?

Gravel/sand - I'm leaning towards sand instead of gravel this time around.

I'm debating doing live plants but had terrible luck with them the last time I tried them 8 years ago or so.  I have incredibly hard well water that I can soften but not RO so that may rule live plants out.  I'm not opposed to CO2 - but I'd need to read up a bit on that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really can't stand the way Gargano yells into the mic.  I would tolerate his show when Macnow was on but now that he is off that show, I listen to music at work now instead.  Gargano's whole gimmick, talking about his kids - the 'violations' the cuz stuff - fuck that noise.  WIP really seemed to go all in with him when they did the format change at 94 WYSP. He was the one that announced the changes, it appeared to me that they were grooming him to become the replacement for Angelo when and if that happens.

I think the main reason WIP is set up the way it is, is due to the fact that the general Philly sports fan cares a LOT about Philly sports but when the teams are out of the running, they don't care.  So what does WIP do?  They try to make you listen when the teams are out of season or out of the running.  The whole water cooler concept.

I listen to Missanelli from time to time - he's another one that yells into the mic too much and also does the whole violation thing.  I guess I'm too old for that stuff but it seems like 4th grade to me. 

The people I enjoy the most on WIP in no particular order:

Ray Didinger - always enjoy hearing him speak on football.
Jody MacDonald - always fair even though he's a New Yorker.
Glen Macnow - he does the best job of talking about non-sports issues when things are slow.
Rob Ellis - another one with a high level knowledge of the game. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Assigning Keystrokes in MAME </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-28 20:48:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a question that I'm hoping someone can answer for me.

I have a CP I purchased pre-made from North Coast Custom Arcades several years ago:

http://www.mameroom.com/Products_QuadController.asp

I mated it to a MKII cabinet and have MAME and Daphne running on an old PC I cobbled together.  I played with it for a while then lost interest in it.  Now two of my kids are keen on playing it and want to see all the old games.

I've managed to assign keystrokes for many of the games including Tempest and Centipede.  One game that is giving me issues is Asteroids.  I can't get MAME to recognize any of the key presses (rotate left, rotate right, thrust, fire, hyperspace).  The key I would like to use for hyperspace is the same key I've assigned to fire in Tempest so I know the key can be assigned and is working.  When I try to manually assign the key in Asteroids by hitting Tab then selecting input for this game it does nothing when I press any of the keys that are laid out specifically for Asteroids.  When I look at the keys assigned for Tempest the fire button is assigned to MOUSE BO.

Any idea on what I need to do to assign the keys for Asteroids? You can see the buttons I'm looking at in this image:

[Quad Controller](http://www.mameroom.com/images/QuadController.png)

They are the two buttons to the left and three to the right of the twister.

Thanks for your help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm very curious to see the responses here.  I have a 14yo son that is having a very difficult time finding things that interest him.  He is bright, has serious musical ability but no real 'desire' to expand it beyond what he has currently.  He does well in school but has serious issues with self motivating to do the work.  If we didn't stay on him he would never get anything done as he would get focused on his one true interest (Pokemon) and spend every waking moment, playing the games and watching youtube videos about them.

My wife and I really wonder what he's going to end up doing in 4 years when he graduates.  I don't think he will have an option for 'government support' and even if it allowed him to live with us - what is he going to do when we are gone? </TEXT>

I'm guessing you are inferring that because Trent was going to sleep at 8:00pm in order to get the amount of sleep he needs that he was somehow off schedule due to the game being late.  Maybe, but I think it had more to do with him being over matched. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a parent with a son who seems to be struggling with many of the things you are (hates being told the whole it's a difference) and just wants to be in his words 'normal'.  You certainly aren't alone in this - not at all.  I see him doing the same things you list, trying hard to fit in.  Not letting himself fall into a new obsession, etc.

How good that will end up doing either of you I have no idea.

I wish I had some great advice, it's a shitty situation you find yourself in.  I'm not on the spectrum myself but I had a really crappy adolescence and it did get better for me once people got past the immature pick on each other phase.

What really bothers me is when people we know mention or compare him to other 'examples' of people on the spectrum.  If I hear one more person compare him to Sheldon Cooper I think I may punch them.

Good luck, I wish you the best. </TEXT>

18 years married - 20 together, 5 children (14,12,11,5,2).  I think the most important attribute that my wife possesses is that she is strong in areas that I am lacking and vice versa.  She is the details person while I am the big picture.  Our childhood experiences were very different and because of that I think our children get a great 'balanced' approach from us.  Despite our differences we mesh well and I believe that is because we both know that the other person provides things that we can't or won't for ourselves.  I think the balance we provide to each other is the biggest reason our relationship is still a success. </TEXT>
