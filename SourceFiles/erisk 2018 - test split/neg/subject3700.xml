<TEXT> Of course not, we all believe in some sort of mixed market economy but we need a liveable wage.  Something Obama never campaigned on.  

Centrism/Third-Wayism is identity politicking paired with analytics to determine policy.  It is voodoo politics.  I am not talking about being an honest moderate.  I'm talking about not taking a position on something until the polls tell you to do so and sometimes wedging on both sides of the issue with no clear policies at all.  That isn't smart to me, that is cowardly.

<TEXT> The Democrat's political power only exists so long as the demonstrations, phone calls, and bad polling for Trump and his policies continue.  

Bush was doing shitty in polls and then he shot up after 9/11 and the first few years of the Afghan/Iraq wars.  Trump really, really, really wants to go to war and most conservatives, some centrists, and the rare progressive will rally around any president during times of war.  Mindless patriotism while America engages in a prolonged conflict with North Korea, Iran, Syria, Afghanistan, etc could see Trump get 8 years, just like Bush.  That is if we aren't dealing with LARPing Fallout on the West Coast.

For sports commentary I go to Twitter and Reddit, I don't want to watch an overpaid idiot in a suit yammer on for longer than the game is played.  

I would pay good money to never have to hear a sports announcer or reporter again.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also, color is conceptual not just a stimulus of photon + rod/cone = neurophysical/chemical/electrical result in brain.  We can use color in a controlled experiment with proto-sapient species like cephalopods, corvids etc and they can then independently associate that color with time, space, friends, food, etc.  Aesthetically color is something that we share with a great many other beings on the planet.  

An aside, some cephalopods can use color to communicate relatively complex concepts with eachother, does anyone know of any research on communicating with them?  I'd love to hear a humboldt squid's opinion of the color red.     </TEXT>

You seriously support fake news?  Also, Ann Coulter is a fucking performance artist who has been shouting about censorship for her monstrous bullshit for decades, it is her whole schtick.

If the Democrats reject progressivism and do not offer an alternative to the status quo, all the Republicans have to do to win in 2018 is lower taxes and do a gimmick like Bush's tax rebate.  At this point I'd rather have a conservative Democrat like Jimmy Carter than the status quo centrists like Pelosi and Feingold.  At least conservatives have an ethos.

<TEXT> https://ivn.us/2015/07/30/story-behind-pay-party-primaries/

The origin of government-administered primaries begins in the late 1800s and early 1900s, when state governments began to intervene to curb the influence of party bosses and tackle corruption. A series of reforms  including regulations, the adoption of the Australian ballot, and direct primaries  culminated in the formation of a hybrid system, whereby public funds are used to administer primary elections that in some states bar participation by unaffiliated voters. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's step back. 

If this theory is true than NATO must prepare for chemical weapon attacks in the European theatre again because Russia is in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  That would turn an arguably minor attack by a failing regime into something that just can't be substantiated without major, major implications.  

I just don't see this theory panning out.  If NATO thought that Russia was using chemical weapons there would be a shrill panic right now.  Russia isn't that stupid.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're fundamentally misunderstanding what's being put to question here. I haven't seen anybody question whether the chemical attacks were carried out or not, but why it was done. I haven't seen anybody question whether 50+ tomahawk missiles were in fact fired, but rather whether real damage was done to the base.

No, I am not misunderstanding anything, [look at #SyriaHoax.](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SyriaHoax src=tyah) There are real accounts across the political spectrum claiming the attack never even happened. 

[How the alt-right brought #SyriaHoax to America](https://medium.com/dfrlab/how-the-alt-right-brought-syriahoax-to-america-47745118d1c9)

 US President Donald Trumps decision to launch strikes against Syria in the wake of a major chemical weapons attack provoked outrage from the far-right groups who were his most aggressive supporters. As rumors of the impending strikes broke, they launched an online campaign claiming that the chemical attack had been a hoax. </TEXT>

We have international aid organizations in this besieged city confirming two chemical weapon attacks, we have a satellite image showing two craters matching the description of the attack, and US allies including France, Canada, and the UK have seen radar and IR data on the flight path of the planes that dropped these chemical weapons. 

Where is the conspiracy, are people seriously implying that Syria has crisis actors being flown in like Sandy Hook?   </TEXT>

That is what you centrists don't get though, you have to fail sometimes to win, being timid in politics capitulates the narrative to the other side, and there is always an *other* side.  The House GOP mindlessly voted against Obamacare, lost all of those votes, and now they just won re-election from lowbrow political theater.    

Sometimes you gotta fight to win -- even if it is a paper tiger, and that also means sometimes getting right on back up and talking the same shit to the motherfucker who just socked ya in your jaw.

We have to go out and physically build the health clinics and community college campuses, that is key to any community functioning, health and education.   These areas will never be able afford these programs on their own, so the rest of us Americans need to chip in, and then the rural folks can depend on us less in the future, as is their nature.  If we give the rural communities the tools to succeed, they will flourish again.        </TEXT>

The current age of automation is taking out retail, white collar, service, scientific, engineering, etc jobs.  This is a wholly different type of automation.

<TEXT> This is a wholly different animal.  

Trump can't escape this one, this one has multiple immediate implications.   One, Comey cannot continue as FBI director if what Trump says is true, but if Trump is lying what does that mean?  We haven't had the President question the motives of the FBI since Watergate.  Two, if what Trump says is true, there must be an immediate disclosure of the transcripts of his conversations to the House and Senate Intel committee. 

There are a litany of other implications and the Trump train has derailed.  Will the GOP get off the train and will they try to put this mess of a presidency on track again, or will they give up and execute plan Pence?

<TEXT> She tried to tear herself away from him. The effort broke against his arms that had not felt it. Her fists beat against his shoulders, against his face. He moved one hand, took her two wrists and pinned them behind her, under his arm, wrenching her shoulder blades.She fell back against the dressing table, she stood crouching, her hands clasping the edge behind her, her eyes wide, colorless, shapeless in terror. He was laughing. There was the movement of laughter on his face, but no sound.Then he approached. He lifted her without effort. She let her teeth sink into his hand and felt blood on the tip of her tongue. He pulled her head back and he forced her mouth open against his.

<TEXT> Intolerance leads to exclusion of others, tolerance leads to inclusion of others.  

In the most simple form the Paradox of Tolerance is that the intolerant will always exclude more people than tolerant people, even if the tolerant people exclude the intolerant.    

You have gone through a good amount of thinking about this, maybe you should try reading a bit about Rawlsian political pluralism next as it expands the meaning of the paradox of tolerance to incorporate [power sharing in a democratic society](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rawls/#ReaPluPubPolCul).

<TEXT> Every single one of my elected officials in my district is a semi-progressive Democrat like Ron Wyden.  I am working against the more centrist ones.  They are the ones causing us to lose, again and again.  

Some of us hit the brick wall of the centrist-led Democratic party 20 years ago.  We told them to swing left and they shit on us, while they lost 100's of elected seats per year.  Don't expect any substantive change from the DNC.  We screamed at them after Gore was anointed as the candidate in 2000, he had a unanimous vote at the DNC because the Democrats forbade anyone from within the party to run.  Expect maybe them trying the same thing with Biden or lord forbid Hillary Clinton in 2020.  

These people always think they are the smartest person in the room.  Their hubris knows no bounds.

<TEXT> The reason the factions of the right virulently hate Democrats/Liberals/the Left is because the Left are legislating substantive policies on the issues of the day that work.  Many of these progressive and common sense centrist/technocratic laws and policies go against every single narrative of how government and the economy works on the right.  They have no coherent ideology to offer on the issues of the day anymore -- FFS, Conservatives have been talking about Supply-Side/Trickle Down economics at CPAC today, like it was 1977 -- so they have become base reactionaries to everything the Left has done in the past 70-80 years. 

These are unhappy vicious ignorant people coming to destroy everything built by large liberal majorities over the decades.   They have no unifying cogent worldview, these people are like wild animals lost in a city for the first time.    </TEXT>

This guy was/is a senior Trump advisor that Trump has flown on his private jet half-a-dozen times and suddenly Trump says he does not know him?  BS.  What kind of person knows people who sell black market missiles?      

There is absolutely smoke, the question is how big the fire is.

Nixon expected America's *Silent Majority* to back him up, but they didn't.  They turned on him when he became weak.  Authoritarians don't follow weaklings.   </TEXT>

Another big battle for marijuana is in agriculture.  Soon corporations will be demanding to grow MJ in quantities high enough to export to other weed legal states.  That will require federal legalization.  Then we'll see marijuana effectively take over for tobacco as a cash crop, that will be insane.  It will change tobacco country overnight.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wish people would stop saying that the right wing in the UK is like America's modern democrats.  It sounds correct if you know nothing about UK politics, but when you look at the details of policies espoused and policies followed it is a patently absurd statement.  

The Tories are not just destroying decades of policies built upon by Labour governments like the NHS.  They are going after good sense bills that were put there to prevent climate catastrophe because it goes against their narrative that more industry is good.  The Flood   Water Management Act in the UK is criminally underfunded, there isn't even enough money allocated to it to do the studies that the law itself requires because those studies make farmers and industrialists look bad, and those two groups vote Tory.

The Tories are fucking their constituents, future floods will now happen because they stopped what should be to any reasonable person a common sense technocratic law to prevent economic damage and loss of life as a winkwink to their deluded/malevolent supporters.  That sounds a lot more like Republicans than Democrats to me.
