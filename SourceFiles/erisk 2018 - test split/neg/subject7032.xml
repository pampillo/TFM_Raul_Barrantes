<TEXT> **Josh**: Hey man, thanks for staying to help cleanup last night. Hope you had a good time. 

**Me**: Your party was a blast. Howd it go with Casey? 

**Josh**:  No go bro. She had to take her wasted friend home. 

I slid the phone back in my pocket. I was only asking to be polite. I couldnt care less about Josh or his parties. I wouldnt have gone at all if Kimberly, a girl from my physics class, hadnt mentioned she was going too. She only knew my serious, studious side, but theres nothing like a party to show how suave and charming I could be, right? 

Just my luck that she didnt show and I had to endure an evening of beer like piss, screaming idiots, and that damn UNCE UNCE UNCE music which I know is going to haunt me all day. That and this pounding hangover. 

**Josh**: My poor turtle had to put its head back in the shell. You know what I mean?

Why is he still texting me? How do I even reply to that? I hope he doesnt think were friends now. I didnt even know his frat house was hosting the stupid party. Maybe if I dont reply hell just  

**Josh**: The flight was ready for landing, but the runway was blocked by a fat cow. The dive was scheduled, but there were a bunch of needy sharks in the water. It was time for my pizza, but the meatloaf wasnt having any fun so I guess that means ALL the food had to get sent back.  

**Me**: That makes absolutely no sense, but I get it. 

Now will HE get it? Of course not. If he got it, he wouldnt still be texting me. 

**Josh**: BTW bro. Do you know who Kimberly is?

**Me**: Yeah. Was she there last night? 

No. Josh couldnt have. Please God, dont let that disgusting frat boy anywhere near  

**Josh**: Some dipshit wrote Kimberly is dead. Stop wasting time on her with a marker on my wall. Good thing for renters insurance, lol. 

---

The chair in front of me was empty in physics today. The long golden braid which usually fell about my desk was gone. I hadnt realized how long this class was when I had to stare at the whiteboard instead. To make matters worse, the stream of texts from Josh didnt stop. 

**Josh**: Dude I found another message. This one was written in my bathroom: Her head took the longest to remove. The vertebra kept snapping, and her neck must have stretched four feet before it finally popped free. WTF?

**Josh**: Heres one written on my closet: Her breasts looked much bigger when they were still attached. Such a fake girl, no-one will miss her.  

**Josh**: Theres another on the side of my fridge. Im saving some for later. 

I excused myself to leave. I still had biology after this, but I felt like I was going to be sick. This had to be a twisted prank. Maybe he thought I wanted to join his frat or something, and this is what they did to haze people. But then why wasnt Kimberly in class?

I couldnt let this get to my head. All I had to do was check her Facebook, right? Okay, no updates since the day before last. But I could send her a message.  

*Hello Kimberly? Weve never really talked, but I just wanted to make sure you havent been butchered. Hope we can go out sometime.*  


Yeah that isnt the suave first impression I was hoping to make. Think. Think! I was freaking out. Of course I didnt have to mention the butchery. If she replied at all, then she was okay, right? Do you think *you're* nervous texting a girl for the first time? Try it when all you can think about is her dismembered corpse scattered across some frat house. 

**Me**: Hey Kimberly. Did you go to Joshs party last night?

DELETED

I couldn't send that, because then I'd just be admitting to eavesdropping on her plans. How about

**Me**: Hey Kimberly. Saw you missed physics today, so I wanted to remind you about the quiz on Friday. 

I closed my eyes and hit send. I hope that doesn't make me sound like all I cared about was physics. Maybe I should add a follow up to ask -

BZZZ

A reply! She's okay! I mean of course she's okay, but she replied! And so quickly too. You don't reply that fast unless you really want to talk to someone -

**Josh**: [DUUUUDE LOOK WHAT'S IN MY FRIDGE](http://www.fadoflo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/p376080-Niagara_Falls-Dahmers_Fridge.jpg)

He sent me a couple more texts, but I didn't read them. I was running toward his place. Either something horrible has happened and I had to see for myself, or he was trolling me and was about to receive a beating of a lifetime. By the time I got over, I still hadn't received a reply from Kimberly. That could mean anything though. If she wasn't in class, it was because she was busy with something so of course she couldn't reply. So why did I feel like I was going to die? 

This place looked even worse in the daylight. The building had been trashed and stitched together so many times it might as well have been the Frankenstein's monster of frat houses. I pounded on the door so hard that my hand went numb.

"Josh! Get your ass out here!" 

The door opened and I almost hit him in the face. Then he started laughing, and I really *did* hit him. Right between the eyes. My fist stung like hell, but it felt so good I would have done it a hundred more times. It had all been a prank! Kimberly was okay. 

"Shit dude, cool it. Can't you take a joke?" 

"Who does that? How badly do you need attention that you would screw with me like that? Never talk to me again." 

I've seen enough. I turned around and stomped my way across the yard. 

"Common man, it's not like that. I just found the photo online somewhere, but the messages were real." 

"You're messed up, man. Leave me alone," I said. 

"Look! There's another one on the fence!" he shouted after me. 

"So what? You probably wrote it you twisted shit."

"I swear dude. I didn't write any of it. The picture is the only thing that wasn't real." 

I didn't want to look, but I couldn't help myself. I glanced at the fence. Written in black marker, it said: "She was my third." 

What is even worse than listening to him? Believing him. Because looking at those big blocky letters, I know Josh couldn't have written that. I know because it was unmistakably [my handwriting](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade). 

---

Update: Kimberly is dead. There was a short mention of it on my school website feed. No details were listed, but I'm doing my best to find out more. Shit, I'm doing my best just to stay sane, but if I can figure out what the hell is going on, I'll let you all know.

<TITLE> The Solution to Prison Overcrowding - Part 1/2 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-06 00:14:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> *The US prison system has grown 700% over the last generation. It's costing us up to 40k per inmate every year - 74 billion annually nationwide.* 

*This program is exploring a way to maximize efficiency by condensing 10 years worth of punishment into a single weekend. Welcome to camp Rawhide...*

---

There is no Devil, only man, and he does not buy souls. Not all at once anyway. Man is far more insidious than that, for he grinds down his brother's soul one layer at a time until the residual humanity begins to devour itself. It's hard to believe, but it's true. Begin to break a man, and he will finish the job on his own. That is because it is much easier to live as an animal than it is as half a man. 

I felt the first part of my humanity die when I was 12 years old. How do you explain a knotted garbage bag full drowned kittens to a child? I was young, but not too young to know that someone had done it on purpose, and that they had gotten away with it. Not too young to understand that evil wasn't just a thing in cartoons and movies; not too young to realize that I too was capable of evil if I ever got my hands on this monster.

Over the years I felt more of myself slip away. Sometimes it would break off in big chunks like when my mother died, but more often my soul simply eroded from the steady tide of petty grievances, jealous greed, thoughtless anger, and the thousand other frustrations that make up the life of any "civilized" man trying to find his place in the world. 

My defense attorney wanted me to talk about how I regretted killing Edward. That it was a defining moment in my life, and that my mind had been blown wide with righteous rebirth and revelation. There wasn't enough left of me to lie though. I don't think my pulse even rose the night I took my neighbors life. Edward used to beat his wife, and now he doesn't. That's all that changed, because there wasn't enough left of me to change. It almost makes me laugh now to think how far I still was from rock-bottom.

I got 15 years for that. Could have been worse, but the judge and jury were sympathetic after hearing the widow tearfully thank me for saving her. I can't even say I found jail any worse than the outside either. The only difference was my daily routine, and the blur of a different set of faces performing it with me.  

I gained a reputation as a loose cannon in jail. People said I'd go from deadpan silence to an incoherent rage in one second flat. I don't think of it that way though. I think of myself more like a brilliant pianist: seeming ordinary until sitting down to play. The musical ability didn't suddenly appear out of nowhere, it had been inside all along. It was the same with my anger: it was always there, but it was my choice whether to let it play. 

I was five years into my sentence before one of the guards took my moods personally, landing me in the hole. It was only supposed to be for a week, but everything I did seemed to extend the time. Unresponsive to the officer? Add a week. Didn't eat the food? Add a week and get my next meal replaced with "the loaf" (rotten cabbage and bread). Didn't eat the loaf? Another week, and no other food until I choked it down. Even after I vomited it back up, they wouldn't give me more food until I'd eaten my sick just to teach me a lesson. 

I don't know what that lesson was, but the only thing I learned was to hate the hole. Having nothing to do is boring, but knowing it will continue without cessation is despair. I was never a social person, but I found myself so starved for human contact that I even tried hugging the guard. It was like I needed someone to touch me just to prove I was still real, but nothing relieved the relentless pressure of the second by second attack on the soul which was isolation.

I knew I was really losing it when a fly found its way into my room. I named it Ribazzzio and talked to it just to hear something beside the droning of florescent lights and the distant shouts from other cell blocks. I told Ribazzzio about the girl I liked in high-school, and how beautiful the sly wrinkle at the edge of her smile was. I described to him what a sunrise looked like, and the taste of chocolate cake, and about the drawings I used to sketch, and a thousand other things which I hadn't appreciated at the time. I didn't tell the fly that I never expected to see them again; I didn't want to make him sad and leave. It didn't matter though, because the next time I woke he was gone anyway. I'm not ashamed that I cried to be alone again, in fact I was relieved. It meant there was still part of me which was human enough to feel. 

"Pssst. Hey buddy." 

I opened my eyes. I wasn't sleeping - I was just lying on my back, preferring my malleable imagination to the stagnant cell. The voice had come from behind me. 

"Can you hear me? What's your name?" the voice asked.  

Someone else must have heard me talking to the fly. I turned around and found a crack in the mortar behind my bed. It must have connected with another cell in the Housing Detention block. 

"Does it matter?" I asked. 

"Of course it does. It's the most important thing in the world. It's the thing they can't take from you. My name's Riley." 

"Hi Riley. I'm Travis," I replied. 

"Have you been recruited yet, Travis?" 

"I don't know what you're talking about," I said. I glanced back at the closed door of my cell. Even if someone heard me, they'd probably just think I was talking to myself again. It's not like they checked in on us very often. 

"Okay good," Riley said. "They're going to offer you a deal soon. You have to take it - trust me." 

"What deal? Why would I trust you? I don't even know you." 

"Sure you do buddy," he said. "I'm your only friend in the world." 

I heard metal scrape on metal. My door opened. I threw the pillow over the crack in the mortar and sat riggedly upright. 

I was reluctant to leave my new friend, but I don't think the guard noticed. My muscles were stiff from the cramped quarters, but I didn't even run around much. All I could think about was how great it would be to have someone to talk to now. And the deal? It couldn't have been that special if he was still in prison, but it was something to think about. Something to look forward to. Maybe they'd even given him books or a notepad. A laptop or TV would be almost as good as getting out. 

Riley never answered again though. For two days I tapped on the wall, but all I heard was ceaseless muttering. An old man swearing under his breath kind of muttering, like he was trying to talk but couldn't decide whether he was talking to himself or someone else. All hours of the day and night - non-stop muttering. I don't even remember him pausing to eat, let alone draw breath. 

Most of it was inaudible gibberish, but there were a few things I finally made out after they were repeated for the thousandth time.  

*"Didn't expect to see him again. No sir-ee no."* 

*"Just pretend to be human for me, will you? We can both pretend."* 

*"I'm Riley. You're Riley too, but I was Riley first."* 

I lost track of how long I was supposed to stay in here, but I'm sure I should have been out of solitary a long time ago. By the time they came to offer me the deal, I was completely convinced that accepting it was the only way to ever get out. 

"It's very simple, we have nothing to hide," the prison warden told me. He looked like the type of man who would force his children to only speak when spoken to, and even then only if they addressed him as 'sir'. 

"We could easily force you to accept," the warden continued, "after all, you are in my power. I choose when you sleep, when you eat - *if* you eat - but I am still making this a completely voluntary arrangement."

"What do you want from me?" I asked. 

"Prison overcrowding is a serious issue," the warden said. It felt like he was reading from a pre-prepared script. He was looking at me, but I wasn't really being *seen*. "The prison system is rapidly becoming unsustainable, and the government is actively exploring alternative programs which can satisfy the need to deter and rehabilitate criminals without the prohibitive expense and opportunity cost of prison. I'm offering you the chance to volunteer in one of these programs." 

"You're going to take me out of prison? Then how come Riley stayed in here?" 

The Warden's face screwed up like he'd just taken a bite from a lemon. "Riley is gone. He's been gone for awhile now." 

There was something about how he emphasized the name which made it seem like Riley hadn't changed locations. He'd changed from being Riley. The warden was already talking again though, and there wasn't any space to ask more questions. 
 
"I can't disclose all the details with you, but rest assured your sentence will be considerably abbreviated. Our programs are designed for maximal efficiency, and fifteen years of wasted time and money are going to be condensed into a weekend."  
  
I didn't care about the time. What did I have to look forward to on the outside? It might seem inconsequential to you, but the only reason I accepted his offer was that I missed having someone to talk to. And if this was a government project, then what was the worst they could do? Maybe I really could get a clean start. 

The warden gave me some papers to sign and then left. I was handcuffed by the guard and escorted out of my cell. He tried to keep my head low, but I caught a glimpse of the adjoining cell where Riley must have stayed. A man in a rubber suit was pressure washing blood out of the stone tiles. 

"What happened to that guy?" I asked the guard. "Is he hurt?" 

The guard shifted uneasily and looked around like he wasn't sure if he was supposed to say or not. Then he shrugged.

"What was he still doing in there?" I pressed. "I thought Riley made the same deal."

"Yeah he finished his deal," the guard said. "He was supposed to be released in a few more days after the official pardon was granted, but I donno. Guess he wanted a quicker way out." 

The man in a rubber suit picked up a fork on the floor. It was covered in congealed blood all the way up the handle. I tried to get a better look, but the guard shoved me onward. I was put into the back of an unmarked police car. Somehow I'd expected a whole bus load of people, but it was only me. In a few days I'd be a free man. It hardly seemed possible. How was I supposed to pick up the pieces and become something new? And it sounded like Riley really was going to be released, if he hadn't... well I wasn't as fragile as him. I could survive anything for a weekend. 

I wasn't paying much attention to where we were going, but we drove for a long while before the car stopped at a ranch deep in the desert. There weren't any pens for animals, just wide open spaces separated by low stone barriers which I could have easily stepped over. I guess they didn't worry much about escape when there was nowhere to escape to. 

"Welcome to camp Rawhide," I was greeted by a man wearing a leather vest and denim pants who stood outside the ranch house. The officer un-cuffed my hands, but I didn't move. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. 

"Ten years left on your sentence, all over in two days. Seems like a pretty good deal to me, eh? But don't you worry, you won't miss out on anything," the man continued. His voice was muffled from speaking around the cigar in his mouth. His eyes didn't leave my face - mine didn't leave his. "It's my job to make sure you still get 10 years worth of punishment this weekend." 

I heard the sound of tires roaring over dry earth. I hadn't even noticed the officer had gone, but it was too late now. I couldn't look away from the man in front of me. The man I killed. 

"What are you doing here?" 

Edward grinned. He took a step closer to me and took the cigar out of his mouth. 

"Same thing as you, darling. I'm just trying to find some justice in this shit-stain world. But between you and me, I don't know if there really is any justice out there. I reckon there's just people who got what they deserved, and people who got lucky."

Another step closer. I could feel the heat radiating from the end of his cigar as it brushed my hand. He was exactly the same as that insufferable creature I used to live next to. His words blew onto my face alongside his rancid breath. 

"And by the time I'm through with you, there won't be any doubt. You weren't one of [the lucky ones](http://tobiaswade.com/horror-blog)."

<TITLE> I have a new scar every morning </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-03 19:11:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> No not a cut. Not a bruise from sleepwalking or a bang where I drunkenly hurt myself without remembering. I'm talking jagged, gnarly, vicious scars which looked like they've healed years ago. 

The first one to appear was an inch long incision on my stomach, almost like a surgical wound. I live in college with a roommate (Robert), but he didn't remember anything happening. Then I called my parents and asked them if I'd ever had a surgery before, but the only procedure I'd undergone was having my wisdom teeth removed; a dead end, unless they thought the stomach was a shortcut to the mouth. 

I figured that I just hadn't noticed it before. Or perhaps something traumatic happened and I completely blocked out the memory, but I didn't worry about it. I played basketball in high-school and have had my fair share of being knocked around, so it must have been from something then. Those were the glory days man. I play on my collegiate intramural team now, but it's just not the same. I was a school *hero* back then... but life goes on, you know? All the victories and mistakes I made on and off the court, they're all ancient history. 

The next morning I woke with a long scar along my forearm. It must have been deep too, and the skin holding it together was stretched like I've grown since it closed. I ran my finger over it, but it didn't even hurt. The skin was slightly raised and hard, but otherwise I wouldn't have noticed if I wasn't looking right at it. I thought about going to the doctor, but it looked so old that he'd probably just say I forgot what caused it. 

I tried not to think about the scars for the rest of the day, although my buddy Chase noticed it during our practice that evening. I didn't want to sound like an idiot, so I made up a story about this time I fought off a mugger to protect my girlfriend and got a swipe from his switchblade.

"Yeah, I think I remember you mentioning something about that bro," he said. 

Bitch please. I doubt that since I just made the story up on the spot. It wasn't interfering with my game though, and I was so tired afterward that I just hit the showers and went straight to bed. I completely forgot about it until I was falling asleep, and then it was all I could think about. What if something was attacking me in the night? But no, that was ridiculous. But what if something was attacking a younger version of myself in the night? Even stupider. I eventually convinced myself that I was making a big deal out of nothing and fell asleep but...

It was still the first thing I thought about when I woke up. I immediately stripped naked and checked myself in the bathroom mirror. 

"Man are you trying to shit a log or a whole forest? I gotta take a piss." My roommate Robert was pounding on the door. I ran my fingers over my chest for the hundredth time. A giant cross shaped scar on my right peck. The undulating lines wandered haphazardly - grotesquely - like it hadn't been a clean heal. But it was healed alright. I opened the door and stared at him. 

"Have you seen this before?" I asked. 

"Dude are you drunk? I'm not looking at your -" He started back peddling. I grabbed a towel and wrapped it around my waist.  

"Not that, you idiot. This scar. What happened to me?" 

"Yeah, you got in a fight with a mugger when you were in high-school. You said he cut you up pretty bad but you chased him off." 

"I never told you that," I said. "That never happened!" 

"You're being crazy, man. Just let me use the bathroom, okay?" 

Robert pushed past me and closed the door. I went straight to my computer and logged onto Facebook. I've had that thing setup since my freshman year of high-school. There had to be some pictures which proved - man I looked like a little shit back then - okay here we go. Senior Ditch day we all went down to a river and hung out. I was in my swimsuit and - 

And the grotesque scar was on my chest. The ones on my stomach and forearm were there too. I flipped back a few more years and saw it disappear during my sophomore year. From the photos, it looked like whatever happened was in the first semester of my junior year. 

When I thought about that time in my life, there was only one memory which burned so brightly as to cast shadows on the rest. I narrowed down the range of dates, and there was no mistaking it. I found a photo of myself running shirtless with the team the week before - no scars. The week after I wasn't present at the game, then after that I was covered in bandages. But that hadn't happened! I remember we started off the season 4-0 and I played in every game. 

Somehow, there was something about that night which was changing my past. I hadn't meant to hurt her. There was a party to celebrate our homecoming victory game, and everyone was having a little too much to drink. I thought Jessica wanted it - she certainly seemed like she did. There's no way I could have known how she would react the next morning - or what she would do to herself the next month when she found out she was pregnant. It's not my fault Jessica is dead. 

Life goes on, you know? Ancient history. And if somehow these scars appearing on my body were related to that night and I had to carry them as penance the rest of my life, then I could accept that. If that had been all there was, I wouldn't have been so scared or angry.

But the scars this morning were more deliberate. Etched into the back of my hand are the words:

*5/3/17. 6 PM.      
The house where it happened.  
See you there.*  

---

I can't not go. Not with the power she has over me. But I also can't go for the same reason. I don't see any other way to resolve this though, so if you don't hear back from me well... 

I guess she's taken what she needed for her to [find peace](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade).

<TEXT> "I can take care of myself. I'm not crazy, you know. Why does everyone think I'm crazy?" 

"No one thinks you're crazy, Dad. Dementia is nothing to be ashamed of. It's a common medical condition with people your age."

"You wouldn't have locked me up in here if you didn't think I was crazy. When is Elise going to pick me up?"  

It's the same conversation every-time I visited dad in the Forest Glen retirement home. At first he just started forgetting what things were named. Pepsi became "bubble juice" and he'd call his dog a "woofer". We all thought it was hilarious until he started forgetting who we were too. 

He thought I looked familiar, but the helpless frustration on his face as he tried to remember how he knew me was excruciating. My childhood - all our time together - my whole life was just being erased.  

After his wife (my mom) Elise died, Dad completely fell apart. It was like she was his only reason to keep trying at all. He used to passionately assemble model planes and ships, but he smashed them all and wouldn't touch them again. He wouldn't even read or watch TV, preferring to just sit alone and stare at the wall. He stopped taking care of himself and became belligerent when someone tried to help him. 

"Just bury me already, if I'm such a burden," he'd say. 

My wife and I would laugh it off, but we all knew he wasn't joking. He *was* a burden. He needed help going to the bathroom, and showering, and getting dressed, and as much as I told myself that sending him to the home was for his own good, I was relieved when he was gone. 

That's why I was so worried when I got a call from the retirement home two weeks ago. They said Dad was missing. It wasn't the first time he tried to get out, but the nurses always stopped him before he made it past the door. He could barely lift his foot high enough to put a slipper on, but this time he somehow managed to climb straight out the window. 

If he was lost out there, he wouldn't know how to get back. He probably wouldn't even remember who he was. That would have been bad enough, but the note he left behind made me even more anxious. 

"I'm going to be with Elise, and I'm not coming back. Goodbye everyone." 

Dad was going to kill himself tonight. I knew it. I frantically drove up and down the streets around the home, shouting his name - wondering if he'd recognize it or even respond if he did. I checked every puddle he could have drowned in, every bridge he could have jumped from - everything I could think of. My wife was visiting her relatives out of town for the week, but she stayed on the phone with me the whole time to keep me calm. It didn't work.

"But didn't he forget Elise even died?" She asked. "He's probably not trying to kill himself. He just wants to find her." 

I checked back at the house - nothing. I might as well stop by the graveyard where Elise was buried too. It didn't make much sense if he still thought she was alive, but I was desperate. It was about 3 in the morning when I saw his shriveled form hunched over her headstone. 

"Dad? Are you okay?" I approached cautiously, terrified that I was too late. He didn't stir as I drew up behind him. Did he just realize that she was dead? Had he spent the last of his strength coming here to say goodbye?

He didn't turn from the grave when he finally spoke. I remember his words as clearly as the cold night air.  

*I met her in the Spring, she wakes me from my deathly slumber,    
wedding bells in joyous ring, summer toil could not encumber   
one shared soul as ours so blessed, and through Autumn's firey air,   
am I to love her any less, now Winter rips her branches bare?   
Or softly shall I sit and mourn, all the dark hours of the night   
Until once more is spring reborn, and her eyes refill with light?*    

Did he really believe she was coming back? Or was this his way of understanding? I sat down next to him and wrapped my coat around his frail shoulders. His eyes sparkled in the pale moonlight, but not from grief. I don't remember ever seeing him look so happy. 

"But it's already Spring," a voice said. *My mother's voice*. I was watching my Dad and didn't notice until she was standing directly before us. Or maybe she had just appeared there - I don't know - but she wasn't old anymore. She looked how I remember her when I was a child. She embraced my father, and before my eyes he shed his years as lightly as his tears. 

Dad was growing taller. My coat which draped around his shoulders swelled like a balloon as his muscles became firm. The bulging veins in his hands receded as he held my mother, and his skin pulled taut as the deep network of wrinkles which mapped out his life vanished. They both looked younger than I did now.  

Mother winked at me from over Dad's shoulder. She held a finger to her lips and said: 

"It'll be our little secret, okay? Let's all go home." 

---

My wife called a dozen times over the next week. I just told her everything was fine and we'd talk about it when she got back. It was better than fine though - I felt like I was living inside a dream. 

I woke every morning to my mom's scrambled eggs and french toast. I wanted to call in sick from work and spend every minute with them, but she insisted I still go and threatened to drive me there herself. Every night I'd return to watch Dad rebuilding his models, swearing good-naturedly when he couldn't find a piece. Then we'd all eat dinner as a family and watch a movie together - Dad making sarcastic comments throughout and Mom giggling like a school girl with a crush. 

I've never seen them so happy. I've never remembered *being* so happy. They had aged so slowly over the years and I had pulled away from them so gradually that I never really dwelt on how close we once were. It was just like being a kid again. After a disagreement at work, someone even shot back that I *smelled funny*. Who since the 3rd grade has ever used an argument like that? 

I couldn't wait for my wife to get home. I'd kept my parents a secret from everyone, and I was so pleased with myself for resisting the urge to tell her. Sure they couldn't live with me forever, but just seeing the look on my wife's face when she walked in would be priceless. 

When I picked her up from the airport, she seemed a little withdrawn. I tried to kiss her but she pulled away. 

"Have you been okay alone? You've been taking care of yourself, right?" 

I just laughed. She seemed worried about me. Maybe she was tired from traveling, maybe her relatives stressed her out, but as soon as I showed her what had happened she would forget all about it. 

"Welcome home dear!" My Mother said when I opened the door. "And isn't she darling!"

"How was the trip?" My Father asked. 

I just watched my wife's face, unable to contain my gigantic grin. She was shocked alright. Her mouth was just hanging open. Then she coughed and covered her nose.

"Well? What do you think?" I asked her. 

"I think I'm going to be sick," she said - and she was. Right there on the entry mat. The smell of her vomit was like some kind of trigger. Suddenly the whole house smelled absolutely rancid. 

"Do you smell that, Mom? What is it?" 

Mom - what was left of her decaying body - was propped up on the sofa. Dad, bloated from gas and covered with a yellow/green mold, was sitting in his armchair. I couldn't understand what happened. 

My wife ran out and called the police. They took away the bodies and took me in for a psych evaluation. The next few days were a blur, but eventually I was released with the diagnosis of "hallucinations stemming from PTSD". They said my Father had died the night he escaped after catching pneumonia in the night air. They said my mother had been dug up, and that the trunk of my car contained a dirty shovel. 

I don't believe them though. I didn't even own a shovel. I think they were just trying to cover up for something they couldn't explain. I don't get what the big deal was anyway. Even if they were gone, so what if I did want to keep them?

Should I love them any less in [the winter](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade)?

<TITLE> Welcome to Anger Management </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-30 00:13:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I hate Clive. His smug lopsided grin, his greasy comb-over, his horn-rimmed glasses - I don't think I'd brake if I saw him crossing the street. In fact, I fantasize about it every time I sit down in his office.  

"Third time this week, huh?" he asked me. 

"It's not my fault," I said. "I gave Robert every chance to back down. He's the one who should be in here, not me." 

"He's not the one who punched a dent in someone's car." 

Of all the things I hate about Clive, nothing compares to his title as Human Resources Director. I wonder if he ever had sex, or if inconveniencing my life was the only thing he needed to get off.  

"I apologized already, okay? Can I go back to work now?" 

"I can't just keep letting these incidents slide," Clive said, pressing his glasses into his face like he was trying to glue them on. "This is going in my quarterly report to management." 

My fantasy of hitting him with the car now included a section where I back up once or twice. I clenched my fists and took a deep breath, counting off a full ten seconds in my mind. 

Getting written up would jeopardize my shot at the branch manager position. I didn't waste four years of my life in this shit-hole just to stay in sales. As much as it hurt, I was going to have to suck up to this bean-bag masquerading as a human being.  

"You're right, you're absolutely right," I replied. "I was in the wrong there. Even though he was in my parking spot, I shouldn't have punched his car. I know I have a problem, and I've started taking an anger management class. It's going to help and this won't happen again, so please give me one more chance before you report it." 

"Good for you buddy." 

*Buddy*. Call me that again and I'll jab my pen in your neck, *buddy*. I smiled.  

"I'll tell you what," he added. "Give me the number of the place you're meeting at and I'll check in with them. If they think you're showing signs of improvement, I'll keep this out of your report." 

Shit. Now I'll actually have to go to a class. My mouth hurt from smiling so hard. "Sure thing, *buddy*," I said. "I don't have the number with me, but I'll bring it in tomorrow." 

---

I opened the door and immediately shut it again. This couldn't be the anger management class I found online. There was *incense* burning in there, and drums like some kind of freakin' hippy circle. The door opened, and an old Asian man blended into the doorway. 

I felt a certain tranquility just from looking at him. He wore immaculate ceremonial robes like some sort of priest, and his snow-white hair cascaded down his back in gentle waves. He bowed low to me, his body curving with a supple grace which utterly belied his apparent age. 

"Hi, is this where the United Way anger group meets?" 

"Welcome kind sir. My name is Ikari, and it is so good to see a man such as yourself so in command of his own destiny. Won't you please come in?" 

---

There weren't any corny brochures with perfect models saying anger gives you ulcers. No dolls for me to be nice to, no punching bags to vent on. I don't really know what I was expecting, but it definitely wasn't this. 

"The website said 6:30. Where is everyone?" I asked. 

There weren't even any chairs in the small room. Two cushions were placed on the ground between a pair of bonsai trees, and Ikari sat down on one to face me.

"No others, only you. I do not need groups, because those who seek my help must only ask once to be saved."

"I don't need saving, okay?" I was starting to feel uncomfortable. The website looked legit, but this guy seemed more like a cultist than a therapist. What if he didn't have the right accreditation or something? I could be wasting my time.  

"I handle my own issues just fine," I added. "All I need is for you to talk to the HR director at my work and tell him whatever - tell him I'm master of my destiny or something. I already paid online, so are we good?" 

"We are far from good, for we are each imperfect beings inflicted with the human condition. Do not worry though, you will soon be better." 

I checked my watch. Tight smile. Can someone sprain a muscle from forcing too many of those? It felt like it. I sat cross-legged on the available pillow and tried not to swear at the awkward position. 

"Fucking shit. Sorry. Don't you have a chair?" Oops. Oh well, he already knew I had an issue. 

Ikari just smiled, but his was nothing like my smile. His bubbled straight up from the warmth in his heart. It was patient and wise, almost as though he was reading straight from the Divine playbook of the Universe and knew everything was following the script.  

"Do you know why there is suffering?" Ikari asked. The measured tone made me pretty sure he wasn't talking about the lack of chairs. 

"Because we're all evil sinners who deserve it?" I asked. 

"No-one deserves to suffer," Ikari replied. "But we do, because we each carry a Demon in our hearts. Anger, jealousy, hatred, misery, these are ways we feed our Demon. And do you know what happens when we've fed it for too long?" 

I shook my head. My Demon must be pretty full by now. 

Ikari leaned in close to me and whispered: *"Gobble gobble gobble. It eats us right up."* The way he said it made me shudder. It was like he was satisfying a greedy pleasure just from speaking the words. I felt immense relief when he settled back into his own cushion before continuing. 

"Eventually, our Demon becomes stronger than we are and it gets to be the one on the outside. Who we are - who we were - that gets locked away. And unless someone tricks the Demon into eating kindness, gratitude, patience, and other virtues, we will never become strong enough to wrestle the Demon back down." 

"So how do we stop feeding the Demon?" I asked.

"You take away its food," Ikari produced a small wooden jewelry box, every inch of which was engraven with Japanese lettering, "and you put it in here. Have a bad feeling? Write it down on a piece of paper, slip the paper through this hole in the top. Angry at someone? Give it to the box. It won't be long before your Demon begins to starve. Every problem can be solved by simply putting it in the box."

"And that's it? I won't be angry?" I was trying really hard not to laugh at him. 

"And I shall tell Mr. HR that you are all better," Ikari smiled and handed me the box. "Only one more thing - you must not ever open the box, or *Gobble gobble gobble.* Your Demon will feed again." 

---

What a load, right? But that was easier than sitting through a bunch of dumb meetings. I would have just thrown the box out right then, but Ikari might check it later to see the notes I'd put in. 

When I got home, I figured I'd just get it all out of the way at once so I wouldn't have to think about it. I grabbed a notebook and tore out a couple dozen pieces of paper.

**The feeling when I'm stuck going 5 mph on the freeway.** Slip.  
**Clive's everything. I hate him so damn much.** Slip.   
**People who kick dogs. I wish they'd kick Clive instead.** Slip.   

The more I wrote, the more ideas began flooding into my head. Everything I could think of that pissed me off started cramming into the box.  

**People who steal parking spaces (fuck you Robert).**    
**The taste of orange juice after brushing your teeth.**  
**Every girl who has ever given me that "it's not you, it's me" shit.**  

The box didn't look that big, and I expected it to only take ten minutes to fill. Three hours later though, I had emptied an entire notebook and still couldn't feel the paper inside. But do you know what I did feel? 

Like a mother-fuckin' Buddha. It seemed absolutely ludicrous that any of those things have ever bothered me before. Poor Clive, just trying to do his job. Why did I have to give him such a hard time? And Robert *should* have my parking spot near the door. He was older than me, and I didn't mind the exercise. So how in the world did I get to the point of punching a dent in his car? 

I've never slept so well in my entire life. I'm usually tense and unable to find a comfortable position, but five minutes after I lay down I was sound asleep. I did have one troubling dream though: there was a soft light coming from inside the box on my night-table. In my dream I got up to reach for it, but then I heard something inside of it *scream* like a man who has been pushed past the edge of breaking. I opened the box to see what was making the noise, and then *Gobble gobble gobble*. I woke up to the freshest, most miraculous morning I could remember. 

---

The last two weeks were perfect for me. I worked tirelessly, unfettered by the daily aggravations which I used to spend half the day obsessing over. I started bringing the box to work just in case something came up in the day, and things always came up. No point in risking my promotion, right? The box went everywhere with me. 

**The sound of dry erase markers on a whiteboard.** Slip. 

Suddenly the morning meeting was bearable again. 

"Hey did anyone hear that?" Mr. Elsworth turned away from the whiteboard to address the assembly. "Something like a scream?" 
 
A collective shrug and sip of coffee. I thought I'd heard it too though. The moment I slipped the paper in, there had been a soft *flash* of light and an echoing *scream*.

---

**Clients who think they know how to do my job better than I do.** Slip.  
**Having to wear a tie all day. I could strangle someone with this tie.**   

There it was again. It started out as a low *moan*, but rose into a gurgling *scream* after I had slipped the second note in. I glanced up to see Clive standing outside my cubicle. 

"What? What are you doing? What do you want?" Just looking at him made me agitated. 

"I wanted to let you know that I called Mr. Ikari, and he said you showed a complete turnaround. As long as nothing happens before tomorrow, your report is going to be clean. Congratulations buddy."  

**When people I hate call me buddy"**    
**Clive again.**  

The box *screamed*. It was louder this time. Clive had already gone, but someone was going to hear it if I kept this up. This was the second note I'd had to use for Clive too. I guess some hatred is too deep to extract all at once. 

Worse still, the moaning continued even though I wasn't putting anything in now. It sounded like the lamentations of a dying man. I shut the box in my drawer, but I could still hear it *groaning* away. Then a soft *rattle*. I opened the drawer and saw the box trembling as a frightened animal. 

Well shit. I couldn't just throw it away. I had to get my anger out somehow or that promotion was gone. I couldn't keep it here either though, because someone was going to -

"What's that sound? Is that the pipes?" 

I didn't answer them. I didn't look at them. I walked fast through the building with the box in my pocket. The warehouse - it's always noisy down there. If I hide the box, then no-one will hear it and I can still get down to slip a note in if I need to. 

**The sound of forklifts backing up.**  
**The restaurant which always gets my lunch order wrong.**   

It was 4:30 now. Only half an hour to go and I was in the clear. I was walking down to the warehouse to slip my last note of the day into the box.

**Mr. Elsworth keeping people till 5 even when there's nothing to do.**  

I opened the crate of printer paper where I'd stored the box and reached around. Odd, I usually could hear the screaming when I was this close to it. Especially now, since the machinery was all quiet after the warehouse workers left for the day. 

It wasn't there. I practically dove into the crate, but my box wasn't anywhere. It was only half an hour though, right? I could make it half an - but no. Without the box, the anger would still be there. Even if I did get the promotion, I'm sure Elsworth would notice sooner or later and bump me back down. It wasn't fair. I'd put in the work - I was better than any of them. It wasn't right for me to keep getting passed over just because -

*Scream*. There it was. What started out as a horrible sound now filled me with relief. It was the next sound which I dreaded more. 

"What in God's name are you doing in there?" 

I pulled myself out of the crate to face Clive. He was holding *my* box in his hand. And it was open. 

"Give it back. Now," I snapped. "It's mine." 

But he was reading my notes. Those were personal! He had no right to - 

"Is this some kind of joke?" Clive asked. "Why is my name in here? And such rude language -" 

"You want language? Give me back my fucking box." 

My last note of the day was crumpled up in my hand. I was seeing red. I wanted to grab him by the throat and - but no. I needed that promotion. I couldn't lose it now. 

"I'm sorry, Clive. It was just an assignment from anger management class. It's supposed to be confidential, so give it back. This doesn't need to change anything with your report."

"My report?" Clive practically shrieked. "You're still worried about your promotion? You aren't going to have a job at all after this. If this is how you really think, then we have no place for you -" 

I punched him across the face. I didn't want to, but I couldn't stop myself. All the little frustrations and pent up anger from the past two weeks were flooding back. I hit him for every day this company has stolen from my life, for every promotion which passed me over, and for every lonely night I sat at home too tired from work to go out. I pummeled his face into a pulpy mess and still couldn't get enough. 

The box was *screaming* like a banshee, convulsing on the floor where Clive had dropped it. I couldn't tell how much of the blood on my knuckles was his and how much was mine, and I didn't care. As good as it felt to be at peace with myself, this felt *better*. At least for a little while, until Clive stopped moving. 

I dropped him back to the warehouse ground. The *screaming* - it was driving me crazy. I tried to stuff the scattered papers back into the empty box, but they wouldn't fit any more. They spilled out over the ground, covered in my bloody finger prints. 

How did I let this happen? What would Ikari have done? He said any problem could go away if I put it in the box. Well shit, Clive was a problem and now he was going in a box, but that only made things worse. I stuffed his body and the bloody papers into one of the warehouse crates, mopped up as much of the blood as I could, and ran. 

---

"Open up! Open up old man!" I was back at the anger management class. If this was anyone's fault, it was Ikari's. He must have known what the box did or he never would have given it to me. He must know how to make things right. He *had* to. 

The door was unlocked, so I went in. Ikari was sitting on his cushion across from a middle-aged woman. I didn't want to involve anyone else in this, so I waited in the corner for her to finish. She handed him a box which looked just like mine to Ikari and thanked him. She was so grateful. It changed her life. Well good-for-fucking her, because it ruined mine. 

"Please have a seat," Ikari said after the woman had gone. 

"It was opened," I blurted out. "Not by me - somebody else - and they're dead now. This isn't my fault, so you gotta help me fix this." 

"I understand," he replied gravely. Then he leaned in real close - so close I wanted to hit him, but I held myself back - and he whispered: "Gobble gobble gobble." 

I actually pushed him back into his seat. "Don't give me that shit. You must know what happens. Why do you do this to people?" 

A slow smile crept across his peaceful face. "Because I am so hungry. And all the hate they pour into their boxes returns to feed me. But you have already let your Demon out, so what am I to eat now?" 

The dead man in the warehouse was suddenly the least of my problems. Ikari was standing, although for some reason I never remembered watching him stand. Then he was behind me, not having touched the intervening space. I was absolutely speechless. I back-peddled until my back hit a wall -

No, not a wall. He was behind me again. His arm wrapped around my neck, his long nails digging into the side of my throat. 

"When I look at you, all I see is a Demon now," he said. "All I can see is your selfish *hunger*."

I didn't dare speak. Even swallowing was enough to push those nails deeper into my skin. I strained against his implacable grip with my hands, but with every motion the puncture became deeper. His arm constricted with the relentless predatory pressure of a boa, and I was utterly helpless in its grasp. 

"But your Demon has already fed on my meal, so here is what you must do. Find those like yourself with anger burning in their hearts, and collect it for me as I have done with you. Twice each month you will bring me a new box filled with hatred or..." 

He didn't need to finish the sentence. *Gobble gobble gobble*. The pressure slackened just enough for me to nod. 

Maybe someday I will learn how to trick my Demon. Someday I will learn how to be kind even with this hatred burning in my chest, and I will lock him away. Someday I will learn to control my anger and not the other way around, but until then ...

Would you like to stop feeding your Demon? You only need to ask once for me to [save you](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> *"Run away, or you will die tonight."*

That's what I heard from beside me at 2 AM. 

"What did you say?" I asked my husband. He didn't answer. Good, then it wasn't important. I had to use the bathroom anyway, but nestled under a down-comforter with our tabby cat Meeps snuggled between us made me seriously consider my options. Wet the bed? Too sticky. Excavate myself from the pile of blankets and face the cold hard bathroom tiles? Please no. Hold it in and develop a weak bladder? 

Eh, we were all going to get old and fall apart someday anyway. I had no intention of getting out of that bed for anything short of a nuclear strike. Just when I started flirting with the other side of consciousness though, I heard it again: 

*"Run away, or you will die tonight."*

"Wake up Jordan. You're having a bad dream." I sat up and shook my husband's shoulder. He grunted and half-halfheartedly pushed my hand away. That should do the trick. But as long as I was up... 

I uprooted Meeps and climbed out of bed. He gave me that "how dare you, peasant" expression that all cats have mastered without parallel. I was half-way to the bathroom and wondering if I could teach myself to piss while sleepwalking when - 

*"Run away, or -"* 

I stopped and rubbed my eyes. That wasn't my husbands voice. It wasn't coming from my bed at all. That was unmistakably from inside my closet. Don't get me wrong, I'm a strong independent woman. I kill my own spiders and everything, but there's no decent minded person anywhere who could hear that without screaming bloody murder. 

It wasn't really a scream - more of a "what the thunder-flicking-fuck was that?" - but it was loud enough to get Jordan on his feet in a second. It was so cute how protective he was of me. My father never approved of him because Jordan had cocaine trouble as a teenager, but to me he had always been the perfect man. 

"What's going on? Are you alright?" Jordan asked. 

"There's someone here," I replied with the same wide-eyed sincerity a four year old might muster. 

"Honey come back to bed. There isn't anyone-"

*"Run away, or you will die tonight."* 

"There!" I said. "It's coming from the closet." 

"I didn't hear anything."

"Check it for me? Please? Pleeeeease?" I gave him my best impersonation of a desperate puppy. He sighed and headed for the door.   

"Don't! I changed my mind!" I said. "There's a murderer inside!" 

"I wouldn't worry," he replied. "It's probably just my laptop randomly unpausing a video or something. Besides, if it was a murderer, he'd just kill us in our sleep." 

"Real reassuring. Thanks." 

Jordan opened the door, but his body was blocking my view. I hopped around on my toes to peer over his shoulder. 

My Doll - my Angel Doll, the one I'd had since I was a baby - was lying on the ground. I rushed to pick her up, reverently cradling her and completely forgetting about the monster for a moment. She wasn't really an Angel, just a Raggedy-Ann Doll with little cloth wings sewn onto her back. But she was mine, in the same way as my hair was brown or my skin was fair; she was part of me. 

"Well there's nothing in here, so I'm going back to bed," Jordan said, slumping off across the floor. 

"What do you think knocked her off the shelf though?" I asked. "And look! Her stomach is all ripped open." 

"I'll call a doctor in the morning. Goodnight." He was already consumed by the indistinguishable blanket blob. 

I sat there on the floor holding my Doll. We were inseparable when I was a kid. This doll had endured everything, including a part time gig as a bulldog's chew-toy and the lead investigator of a vacuum's inside. She had been ripped, stained, shredded, and impaled a dozen odd times, and Dad had always been able to fix her for me before. Of course, now that he was gone I would have to learn to fix it myself, but that was okay. When I have a kid of my own, they'll probably need me to fix it for them too. 

I gently poked the leaking fluff back into the Doll's chest cavity and - 

"Shit snacks". Something stung my finger prompting its quick passage to my mouth. Was something in there? I opened the Doll a little further, careful not to lose any of the stuffing, and pulled out a tightly folded sheet of paper. I recognized the handwriting immediately.

**Dear Amelie**

It was the same handwriting with the same loopy "D" I had seen every year on my birthday card. Every year except this one anyway. I sat cross-legged on the floor and Meeps wiggled her way into my lap while I read my father's secret letter. 

---

**Dear Amelie**

The telling of an adventure becomes an adventure in itself. Fantasies will unburden your spirit from the constraints of reality, and horror is as thrilling for the author as it is for the reader.  

But my story is not so easily told. Every time I try to bleed my memories free, I am frozen with helpless shame and guilt. The events of my youth have haunted me throughout my life, and I fear I will not go quietly into death until I have found peace in their recounting. 

I hope you will forgive me for inscribing my story in verse. It is the only way I know how to distance myself from the pain and turn the tragedy of my life into something beautiful. I hope before the end of your days you too will find a way to burn your darkness with such brilliant fire as to illuminate the way for others. 

Forever yours,  
-Dad

It should be said, right at the start,  
all happy families are the same.  
For joys are shared in equal parts,     
though misery is unique in blame.  
It comes in many varied forms,  
but you will know it when its seen.     
When the perfect mask is torn,   
and sundered at the seams.   

So it was when I was young,  
a son first and child after.  
Playing with father was endless fun;  
and every shared moment laughter.  
I learned how to view the world  
from astride my fathers knee.  
And when the night left me curled,   
his stories would bring sleep.  

But life is heavier for some than others,  
and it pressed hard upon this man.  
A war waged between him and my mother -  
he stopped trying and simply ran.  
I was left to wondering,  
where my father went at night.    
Then home late with blundering,    
too much drink had made him fight.     

One night the drink brought a rage  
that I had never seen before.  
The beatings could not be assuaged,    
so out I fled through kitchen door.  
I wandered the streets very late,  
hiding from that awful noise,  
not knowing it was my fate,  
to find salvation in a toy.  

Tossed upon garbage and refuse,  
the broken Doll of an Angel lay.   
It was worn-deep from over use,    
but I still took her home to play.   
When the violence was lit by booze,   
I held it to keep my fears at bay.   
Then finally when there came a truce,  
I would thank her when I prayed.  

The quiet never lasted, nor the peace,       
and I kept the doll close beside.   
Once I was too bruised to sleep,  
and waited instead to finally die.  
Instead the Doll began to speak,  
telling me that I was safe.  
That even when the world was bleak,   
I must trust the Doll with faith.  

The Doll offered more than reality,  
and proved my great escape.  
It would sing tales of fantasy:  
of villains, heroes and their capes.   
Beasts and monsters with their fangs,     
of highway men and roaming gangs,   
who were locked up tight with a clang,  
prevailing justice when she sang.  

Since then we never parted ways,  
where I went, the Doll followed after.     
She sat beside me when I played,    
or sheltered me in the attic rafters.  
The doll peaked from my bag at school,    
(the other children laughed, I know).  
But I didnt mind the jeering fools  
who didn't know how to take a blow.  

I wish my mother had a Doll    
to take away her pain -   
to free her back against the wall,  
and cease the falling of the cane.  
I offered the Angel Doll to her,  
but she insisted that I keep.   
Saying it was too late to deter,  
the wounds which cut too deep.   

One night her screaming wouldn't end,    
and I offered up a solemn plea:  
That even this hurt would mend,  
I begged the Angel answer me.  
No comfort now like in the past,  
the Doll offered this foresight:   
"Run away," she said at last.   
"Or you will die tonight."   

---

I stopped reading. I was so tired, I had completely forgotten about what made me get out of bed in the first place. I stared at the coarse face with its black sewn on buttons and flame of red hair. It was just a Doll - the same Doll it had always been. 

"Jordan?" My voice was timid. I shouldn't wake him up again. It was stupid to think -

"Yeah?" 

"Do you trust me?" 

"Of course, honey. What are you still doing up?" 

"I want to get out of the house. Now." 

The pile of blankets slouched aside and he sat up to stare at me. He looked at the letter in my hands, then nodded. He put on his robe and handed me mine, and we walked out the front door in silence. 

"Where are we going?" 

"Away," I said. "Can you drive?" 

It was like he could sense when something was important to me. He smiled and nodded. We didn't need words. I hopped into the passenger seat and flipped on the reading light to finish the letter while he drove. 

---

"Run away," she said at last.   
"Or you will die tonight."   

I grew angry and yelled louder,    
but no other sound came out her.    
I flung her from my window seat,   
out of the house, into the street.   
Telling her she was no good,  
if the Angel no longer could   
speak and tell me calming tales   
drowning out the fighting wails.  

Mother was in pain, a bestial yelp -  
through the thin walled home.  
I couldn't face my fear and help -  
I couldn't bear the sound alone.   
I ran until I was out of breath,  
far away from here.  
I didnt care if I met my death,   
I willed to disappear. 

Snow and bitter winds cut in  
probing through my jacket thin.  
I leaned against a tree to rest,   
yet dared not chance to sleep in less   
I would waken to find myself  
alone in the world with no one else,  
or waken not, stiff frozen skin  
a tribute to what might have been.   

I wish I hadn't thrown the Doll away   
when I needed her the most.  
It wasn't her fault she had to say  
that death was flying close.  
The morning found my mother dead,  
as the Doll that I once found.  
Forsaken and thrown on garbage bed;    
a trash heap burial mound.  

For many years, a lost Raggedy-Ann,  
my Doll must have searched the Earth.   
Until she found not a boy, but a man,  
and his lady who was giving birth.  
I had run so far from life,  
that I had found a life anew.  
The Doll gazed upon my beautiful wife,   
and the child who now grew.   
 
The Angel Doll lay down softly,  
knowing her part had been played.   
The boy was gone, and though missed awfully,    
times direction could not be swayed.  
I found her there, against hospital door,  
still and quiet as the dead.   
I scooped her up and to her swore   
to fix her tattered threads.  

By my word, she was cured  
of the ills this world had shown.   
My baby girl brought in the world   
was gifted with a Doll newly sewn.  
I will never make the mistakes   
that drove my mother to her grave.  
And the Doll will never lie awake  
to take away your pain.  
   
---

I was in tears by the time I finished. Dad would have been 58 on the first of May. Jordan kept giving me these nervous glances, but he was respectful and didn't pry. 

"How much further, you think?" is all he asked. "There's a motel up ahead. Want to spend the night there?" 

These weren't pretty tears. They were big, snotty, sloppy tears. I was too choked up to answer, but he pulled into the parking lot anyway. He understood me so well, it was like he was made for me. 

---

I held the Doll while I fell asleep in the motel. I knew I owed Jordan big for this. I felt so stupid for dragging us out here, but the letter and my cry had been cathartic and I was so tired that I felt oddly at peace. It was the best I'd felt since the funeral. And who knows, maybe some freak tornado will hit the house and I'll know some part of Dad really is still out there watching over -

*"Run away, or you will die tonight."*

It came from the Doll: a small voice like a child who was afraid of being caught. 

"I already did run away." I felt too guilty to wake Jordan up again after all this, so I whispered the reply.

*"Not far enough. He's still with you,"* she replied. I couldn't see the Doll's mouth moving or anything, but there was nothing else which could have been talking to me. I looked over at Jordan's harmless, sleeping body. Was I really going to trust a phantom voice over my husband who I've known and loved for years? 

But it wasn't just any voice. Somehow it was my father trying to reach me, and him I would trust till the ends of the Earth. I took the Doll and my phone and quietly slipped out the door. I wasn't going to leave him stranded, so I took an UBER back home. While we were driving, I wrote him a long text message thanking him for being so understanding and apologizing for my behavior. I told him how much he meant to me, and that all of this was just because I was having such a hard time with Dad's passing. He was so kind that he probably wouldn't have even needed it, but it felt good to tell him anyway. 

I hope Jordan got the chance to read it before he died. The next time I woke, it was to the hammering of police on my front door. They informed me that my husband was found dead in his hotel room with three bullet holes in his chest. Future investigations revealed the coke habit wasn't as ancient history as I thought. He owed a lot of money to the wrong people, and they followed our car to the motel. If it wasn't for the Doll, I'd be dead too. 

I still think Dad was wrong about Jordan though. I don't regret a minute of our time together. And Dad was wrong about another thing too - the Angel Doll was going to have to lie awake with me for a long time before she can [take away the pain](http://tobiaswade.com/horror-blog)

<TEXT> *"Run away, or you will die tonight."*

That's what I heard from beside me at 2 AM. 

"What did you say?" I asked my husband. He didn't answer. Good, then it wasn't important. I had to use the bathroom anyway, but nestled under a down-comforter with our tabby cat Meeps snuggled between us made me seriously consider my options. Wet the bed? Too sticky. Excavate myself from the pile of blankets and face the cold hard bathroom tiles? Please no. Hold it in and develop a weak bladder? 

Eh, we were all going to get old and fall apart someday anyway. I had no intention of getting out of that bed for anything short of a nuclear strike. Just when I started flirting with the other side of consciousness though, I heard it again: 

*"Run away, or you will die tonight."*

"Wake up Jordan. You're having a bad dream." I sat up and shook my husband's shoulder. He grunted and half-halfheartedly pushed my hand away. That should do the trick. But as long as I was up... 

I uprooted Meeps and climbed out of bed. He gave me that "how dare you, peasant" expression that all cats have mastered without parallel. I was half-way to the bathroom and wondering if I could teach myself to piss while sleepwalking when - 

*"Run away, or -"* 

I stopped and rubbed my eyes. That wasn't my husbands voice. It wasn't coming from my bed at all. That was unmistakably from inside my closet. Don't get me wrong, I'm a strong independent woman. I kill my own spiders and everything, but there's no decent minded person anywhere who could hear that without screaming bloody murder. 

It wasn't really a scream - more of a "what the thunder-flicking-fuck was that?" - but it was loud enough to get Jordan on his feet in a second. It was so cute how protective he was of me. My father never approved of him because Jordan had cocaine trouble as a teenager, but to me he had always been the perfect man. 

"What's going on? Are you alright?" Jordan asked. 

"There's someone here," I replied with the same wide-eyed sincerity a four year old might muster. 

"Honey come back to bed. There isn't anyone-"

*"Run away, or you will die tonight."* 

"There!" I said. "It's coming from the closet." 

"I didn't hear anything."

"Check it for me? Please? Pleeeeease?" I gave him my best impersonation of a desperate puppy. He sighed and headed for the door.   

"Don't! I changed my mind!" I said. "There's a murderer inside!" 

"I wouldn't worry," he replied. "It's probably just my laptop randomly unpausing a video or something. Besides, if it was a murderer, he'd just kill us in our sleep." 

"Real reassuring. Thanks." 

Jordan opened the door, but his body was blocking my view. I hopped around on my toes to peer over his shoulder. 

My Doll - my Angel Doll, the one I'd had since I was a baby - was lying on the ground. I rushed to pick her up, reverently cradling her and completely forgetting about the monster for a moment. She wasn't really an Angel, just a Raggedy-Ann Doll with little cloth wings sewn onto her back. But she was mine, in the same way as my hair was brown or my skin was fair; she was part of me. 

"Well there's nothing in here, so I'm going back to bed," Jordan said, slumping off across the floor. 

"What do you think knocked her off the shelf though?" I asked. "And look! Her stomach is all ripped open." 

"I'll call a doctor in the morning. Goodnight." He was already consumed by the indistinguishable blanket blob. 

I sat there on the floor holding my Doll. We were inseparable when I was a kid. This doll had endured everything, including a part time gig as a bulldog's chew-toy and the lead investigator of a vacuum's inside. She had been ripped, stained, shredded, and impaled a dozen odd times, and Dad had always been able to fix her for me before. Of course, now that he was gone I would have to learn to fix it myself, but that was okay. When I have a kid of my own, they'll probably need me to fix it for them too. 

I gently poked the leaking fluff back into the Doll's chest cavity and - 

"Shit snacks". Something stung my finger prompting its quick passage to my mouth. Was something in there? I opened the Doll a little further, careful not to lose any of the stuffing, and pulled out a tightly folded sheet of paper. I recognized the handwriting immediately.

**Dear Amelie**

It was the same handwriting with the same loopy "D" I had seen every year on my birthday card. Every year except this one anyway. I sat cross-legged on the floor and Meeps wiggled her way into my lap while I read my father's secret letter. 

---

**Dear Amelie**

The telling of an adventure becomes an adventure in itself. Fantasies will unburden your spirit from the constraints of reality, and horror is as thrilling for the author as it is for the reader.  

But my story is not so easily told. Every time I try to bleed my memories free, I am frozen with helpless shame and guilt. The events of my youth have haunted me throughout my life, and I fear I will not go quietly into death until I have found peace in their recounting. 

I hope you will forgive me for inscribing my story in verse. It is the only way I know how to distance myself from the pain and turn the tragedy of my life into something beautiful. I hope before the end of your days you too will find a way to burn your darkness with such brilliant fire as to illuminate the way for others. 

Forever yours,  
-Dad

It should be said, right at the start,  
all happy families are the same.  
For joys are shared in equal parts,     
though misery is unique in blame.  
It comes in many varied forms,  
but you will know it when its seen.     
When the perfect mask is torn,   
and sundered at the seams.   

So it was when I was young,  
a son first and child after.  
Playing with father was endless fun;  
and every shared moment laughter.  
I learned how to view the world  
from astride my fathers knee.  
And when the night left me curled,   
his stories would bring sleep.  

But life is heavier for some than others,  
and it pressed hard upon this man.  
A war waged between him and my mother -  
he stopped trying and simply ran.  
I was left to wondering,  
where my father went at night.    
Then home late with blundering,    
too much drink had made him fight.     

One night the drink brought a rage  
that I had never seen before.  
The beatings could not be assuaged,    
so out I fled through kitchen door.  
I wandered the streets very late,  
hiding from that awful noise,  
not knowing it was my fate,  
to find salvation in a toy.  

Tossed upon garbage and refuse,  
the broken Doll of an Angel lay.   
It was worn-deep from over use,    
but I still took her home to play.   
When the violence was lit by booze,   
I held it to keep my fears at bay.   
Then finally when there came a truce,  
I would thank her when I prayed.  

The quiet never lasted, nor the peace,       
and I kept the doll close beside.   
Once I was too bruised to sleep,  
and waited instead to finally die.  
Instead the Doll began to speak,  
telling me that I was safe.  
That even when the world was bleak,   
I must trust the Doll with faith.  

The Doll offered more than reality,  
and proved my great escape.  
It would sing tales of fantasy:  
of villains, heroes and their capes.   
Beasts and monsters with their fangs,     
of highway men and roaming gangs,   
who were locked up tight with a clang,  
prevailing justice when she sang.  

Since then we never parted ways,  
where I went, the Doll followed after.     
She sat beside me when I played,    
or sheltered me in the attic rafters.  
The doll peaked from my bag at school,    
(the other children laughed, I know).  
But I didnt mind the jeering fools  
who didn't know how to take a blow.  

I wish my mother had a Doll    
to take away her pain -   
to free her back against the wall,  
and cease the falling of the cane.  
I offered the Angel Doll to her,  
but she insisted that I keep.   
Saying it was too late to deter,  
the wounds which cut too deep.   

One night her screaming wouldn't end,    
and I offered up a solemn plea:  
That even this hurt would mend,  
I begged the Angel answer me.  
No comfort now like in the past,  
the Doll offered this foresight:   
"Run away," she said at last.   
"Or you will die tonight."

"Jordan?" My voice was timid. I shouldn't wake him up again. It was stupid to think -

"Yeah?" 

"Do you trust me?" 

"Of course, honey. What are you still doing up?" 

"I want to get out of the house. Now." 

The pile of blankets slouched aside and he sat up to stare at me. He looked at the letter in my hands, then nodded. He put on his robe and handed me mine, and we walked out the front door in silence.

<TEXT> I'm going to tell you a secret that I don't tell anyone. I'm a US veteran of the war in Afghanistan. I was stationed in the Uruzgan province when Taliban militants attacked our coalition base. I stood next to a man I knew since training when a RPG-17 rocket hit the three story building behind and buried us both alive, and I held the flag they sent home to his mother after I crawled out. I've tortured a man for information, threatened a child to coerce his parents to cooperate, and of the seven people I know I've killed, only five were fighting back.  

But that isn't the secret, because I was just following orders. The secret is that when I'm lying awake at night thinking about all the things done to me - all the things *I've done* - I'm not not traumatized by it all. The secret is I can't sleep because I miss it. 

Adrenaline, fear, excitement - it's all the same thing. I've been addicted to it for as long as I can remember. While other kids were riding skateboards around the neighborhood cul-de-sac, you'd find me grinding along the railings of a rooftop. They threw water balloons, I threw rocks. They learned to drive, I organized street races with my brother. By the time I graduated high-school, I already had a juvie record for fighting. The cop sat me down with an army recruitment officer, and they told me my life had only two possible outcomes left.   

"You're going to either keep playing at these stupid stunts until you get locked up for life, or you're going to man up and become somebody."

I told them I had changed, and the officer decided my past mistakes wouldn't disqualify me from enlisting. He was wrong for believing me - I just thought shooting guns sounded like a hell-of-a lot more fun than sitting behind bars. He was right that I would make a damn good soldier though. Sure it wasn't all excitement, but my life had a purpose and I could finally put my natural affinity to good use. For the first time in my life, I was courageous instead of stupid; a hero instead of a freak. 

I didn't come home in a body bag like I had expected, but the wheelchair I got was even worse. The bullet between the 2nd and 3rd lumbar bones is still lodged in my spine, and that was it for me. I didn't know if I would ever get out of that chair, but even if I could, my days of living on the edge were over. 

*And I hated it.* 

I hated the army for kicking me out (I would have crawled back into battle if they let me). I hated my brother for the pity he gave me, I hated the boring town I was stuck in, and more than anything, I hated myself for not having anything left to live for. I wheel out to the end of my driveway every month to get the disability check they mail me, but besides that I just sit at home and watch movies. 

War movies. *Horror movies*. Anything that could make me forget, even for a moment, that the most excitement I was ever going to get was checkup time when the nurse leaned over my chair to measure my stagnant pulse. My brother tried to get me to go out with him more, but I couldn't stand being dragged away from my movies. I wish I could be *inside them* and never come out. That's when he came up with an idea for a compromise: 

"How about you and me go down to the new Virtual Reality Arcade?" he asked. "They've even got some immersive horror ones that are so real you'll piss yourself." 

"Sounds like my everyday life," I replied. 

---

I ended up going just to shut him up, and the place was actually a lot cooler than I expected. The arcade was divided into personal pods that looked kinda like spaceships. The assistant was a geeky Japanese dude and spoke with a weird inflection which kept swinging back and forth. He probably spent his spare time making fan-made anime dubs or some nonsense. He helped me get setup with the headset and headphones, and made sure the wheelchair didn't get tangled up in any of the wires.

As you might have guessed from my introduction, not much impresses me. But holy shit, this technology has come a long way since the blurry 3D movies I saw as a kid. I found myself confronted with a menu hanging in the air which looked real enough to touch. I selected the horror genre, and then a few more options came up. 

**Select your difficulty. Are you a:**  
-    
**Grandmother with a heart condition.**      
**Kid with something to prove.**    
**SWAT team looking for practice.**     
**A lost soul seeking forgiveness from GOD.**  

That last one didn't really sound like a degree of fear to me, but they were organized in ascending difficulty so I selected that. Any hope of a thrill immediately disappeared as a fat cartoon Devil with a pitchfork ran across my field of vision. 

"I can see you!" he said, waving his pitchfork at me. "Can you see you?"

"No, because I'm not a stupid cartoon. You sure this game is for adults?" I spoke aloud. 

"Just wait and see," the Japanese guy said. It was weird hearing him talk when I couldn't see him. I think he was still speaking, but the words were drowned out by the game music which started playing. It sounded like the bad haunted houses they try and push off on kids: full of rubber spiders, cobwebs, and jars of "intestines" which are just spaghetti and meat-sauce. 

My viewpoint was walking along a dark road at night which led to a trapdoor in the ground like a cellar. The cartoon Devil popped up again, and I physically prepared myself for death-by-cringing. I get that my brother felt as helpless as I did, and I know he is just trying his best which is still more than can be said for me. I guess it wouldn't hurt to at least *pretend* to have fun. 

"Through me is the space between you and the Divine; infinite and eternal, inseparable and simultaneous," the Devil said, his voice completely different than his last utterance. The words popped with a confusing static noise. It was almost as though instead of hearing the words, I heard every imaginable sound *except* the words, and my brain filled in the missing space just like it does with white lettering on black paper.  

"Are you scared yet?" I faintly heard my brother's voice through the headset. I shrugged and gave a thumbs up. The trapdoor opened, and I *lurched* in my chair and something hurt in my back as the viewpoint suddenly dropped into the Earth. It felt impressively real, almost like I was on a roller-coaster which plunged into the darkness. I heard my brother laugh at my reaction. I figure that's enough satisfaction for him. No more looking startled, or I'll never hear the end of it. 

I could faintly see phosphorescent mushrooms and rocks lighting the deplorable descent. I was continuing to accelerate as I fell, and I even felt wind blowing in my face. They must have a fan or something to make it seem more real. The Devil was tagging along with me, but he kept glitching and lagging and getting left behind, only to suddenly reappear in front once more. Then I felt a blast of hot air on my face, and I closed my eyes. Whelp, guess this was it folks. I must be in Hell. 

I opened my eyes and squinted against the brilliant light. I always imagined Hell being darker. Was this Hell-fire? My eyes started to adjust, and I could see the sun reflecting sharply off the wide sandy slopes of... of where? Afghanistan? 

Someone was talking behind me in Dari, the most common language used there. I couldn't understand it, but I could tell the person was afraid. I turned my chair to shift the viewpoint until I saw an old man kneeling in the dirt before two US soldiers who had their backs to me. One of them was holding a picture of an teenage Afghani boy. 

"Do you know who this is? Have you seen him?" the first soldier asked. 

"Is this your idea of a joke, bro?" I spoke aloud. 

"Your brother went to use the bathroom," the Japanese guy said faintly. 

"What kind of game is this?" I asked, but his reply was drowned out by the VR soldiers. 

The old man kept pressing his face against the dirt and shaking his head. One of the soldiers dragged him to his feet and shoved the photo in his face. 

"You know who this is, don't you? Why are you trying to protect him? Do you know what he's done?" 

This wasn't funny to me. I started to take off the headset, but the cartoon Devil appeared in the corner. 

"I can see you!" he said in the silly voice. "Can you see you?" Everything was playing so smoothly it could have been real, except for the Devil which kept lagging and glitching. He was little more than a jumping mass of mis-colored pixels. 

One of the soldiers kicked the man on the ground. As he pivoted his body, I caught a glimpse of my own face under the helmet. Suddenly I remembered who the old man was. Abdul-Baser was a Qalandar or mystic who was suspected of sheltering Taliban operatives in his house. I didn't need to watch to know what happened next. 

I took my headset off and handed it to the Japanese guy. "Did my brother put you up to this?" I asked him. 

"I can see you," the assistant replied. He handed the headset back to me, but I pushed it away.  

"No duh, Sherlock. How did you get this footage?" 

"Can you see you?" he asked. His face froze for a second while he spoke, twisted half-way between words. There were a couple of empty pixels obscuring his mouth, but I could tell he was smiling when he handed me back the headset. I touched his hand - warm and real. Well, I don't know what was going on, but this certainly captured my attention better than any movie. I slowly took the headset from him, and the assistant nodded and smiled while I put it back over my eyes. 

"Hahahaha," the cartoon Devil laughed in a good-natured way. "I played a trick on you: once for what you've done." 

*Flash* I was beating Abdul-Baser inside a holding cell.  
*Flash* I was back in the desert next to the cartoon Devil. I saw it for less than a second, like a single frame inserted into a movie. 

"Yeah, you tricked me alright," I answered. "But you didn't scare me. You think I don't remember everything I saw? I wasn't scared then, and I'm not scared now." 

The scene suddenly dissolved and I was falling through the Earth again. I seemed to be going deeper this time, because the tunnel was lit by flowing veins of lava now instead of mushrooms. I sat calmly in my chair, actually looking forward to what came next. I don't know if I was drugged, or having a stroke, or if the Devil really was trying to teach me a lesson, but I was excited to see just how far the rabbit-hole went. 

This time it was pitch black when I stopped. *Crashed* would be a better word though, because I *felt* it. It was like my whole body had slammed into a wall. This trick could make me feel things? Could something here beat me? Or *torture* me? For a second I actually did start to get scared, but then I reached out with my hands and felt carpet beneath my fingers. That's right, I was still in the VR arcade. I had just fallen out of my chair somehow. Still wearing the headset and seeing nothing but the blackness I landed in, I pulled myself hand-over-hand and crawled back into my wheelchair. 

"I can see you," the static-y absence of words said. "Can you see you?" The Devil rose in front of me, but his appearance had changed as much from that cartoon Devil as his voice had. The shape was dark, but it wasn't just like the lights were off. Ordinary dark is the absence of light, but the presence before me was the *impossibility* of it. In that moment before him, I couldn't even remember what it was like to see, but I could still *sense* his form through the emotional weight it carried. 

*His horns were as sharp as being stabbed by the love of your life after you sacrificed everything to bring her joy.*   


*His face was the burden of holding your dying father in your arms while both of you knew you could have saved him if only you'd tried harder.*    


*His body was the shape of a long life spent in quiet desperation after all living matter had wasted away and you alone remained to dwell upon your regret.*   

"Twice for who you are," the presence said. 

He reached out to touch me, but I couldn't let him. Somehow I felt I would become like him, an unreal embodiment of misery and pain, if the presence of his being were to overlap with my own. It wasn't fear that made me rip off the headset - fear is something consciously recognized in the brain. My terror was something much deeper and primitive, the sort of thing which stirred my ancient ancestors into action to prolong their own purposeless existences in the face of some greater dread of the unknown. 

I tore off my headset and headphones and threw them into the assistant's face. My brother wasn't there, but I wasn't going to wait for him. I sprinted out of the building, bursting out into the bright clear light of my familiar hometown. Boring? How could anything be boring about this place which brought me into this world and formed me into who I am. I ran as fast and hard as I could, taking in deep lungfuls of clean air which filled my body with hope and jubilation. I had my whole life ahead of me, and nothing I had done or been could ever change that. I couldn't remember the last time I felt this good. Hell, I couldn't even remember the last time I walked outside -

And it hit me. I couldn't remember the last time I walked, because I couldn't walk. I slowed down and looked at my legs pumping the concrete beneath me. I could *feel* the blood roaring in my veins and the pressure of my feet on the ground. But I could also see that one leg lagged slightly behind the other even when I stood still, and that it was filled with dead blurry pixels. I walked the rest of the way home, just enjoying how good it felt to move and trying not to look at my glitching legs. 

"Three times for what you will do," said the voice which wasn't a voice. My brother was waiting for me in my home, although every instinct within me *screamed* with the common recognition that it wasn't my real brother. 

"Oh but I can't trick you, can I?" his mouth moved, but it was the silly cartoon Devil's voice which came out. "You're not scared of anything." 

I reached up to my face, but the headset wasn't on anymore. I turned around and started walking upstairs as quickly as I could. My heart was pounding in my chest like a caged animal trying to escape. My brother-who-wasn't-my-brother followed me up to my room.  

"You think you're so strong, don't you? That you don't need anybody. But you know what? But there's no-one else here, so you can tell me the truth." 

The singsong cartoon voice was grating on my nerves. Wherever I was, I wasn't in control. There was no point in trying to outrun something in my own mind. I turned around to face him. 

"I'm not afraid of you or your tricks. What do I have to do to get out of here?" I asked. My voice didn't even shake. I balled my hands into fists, and they were firm and ready.

"Are you sure you want out?" he asked, but it was back in my brothers voice. "Your legs work in here, but they won't out there." 

"I don't care, I want out," I said. 

"Why? Unless you really are afraid." He smiled, and it froze in a glitch. The face was so warped I could barely recognize him. I couldn't stand to look - I wanted to wipe that smile off. If he wasn't going to be reasoned with, then I would have to do things my own way. 

"I'm not afraid!" I shouted. I grabbed him by the front of his shirt and punched him straight across the face. "You're the one who is trapped in here with me!" 

"Then what do you feel?" he asked.

The face felt solid and I could feel the bones of his jaw moving from the impact. The instant I hit him however, his face was replaced with Abdul-Baser. The old man started to pull a handgun from behind his back, but I punched him again, almost breaking my hand against his cheekbone. The face changed again, and this time I was looking into my own eyes. That was it - that was the way out. He was reeling from my blows, and I snatched the handgun from his limp grasp. 

"That's not going to do anything to me -"

"You're right, it won't," I interrupted, my mind racing with the possibilities, "because you're just pretending to be me. It *will* however, work on me." 

I put the gun in my mouth and pulled the trigger. He jumped at me faster - faster than humanly possible - and knocked my hand aside. The gun went off with a deafening ring, and he fell to the ground in a heap. 

"My turn," I said. I put the gun in my mouth, pleased to find that my hand still wasn't shaking, and pulled the trigger. 

---

*"I can see you. Can you see you?"* 

I opened my eyes in the hospital. A doctor was leaning over me, shining a light in my mouth. My head hurt like Hell. I tried to nod, but a searing pain engulfed my awareness and I froze up - almost like a glitch. 

My father was sitting beside my bed. He wouldn't say a word until after the doctor left, but eventually he told me what happened. I had entered some kind of fit at the VR arcade and fell out of my chair, probably caused by the bullet shifting in my spine. My brother took me home and stayed with me to make sure I was okay, but I pulled a gun and tried to kill myself. He managed to stop me, but the gun went off and hit him. I shot myself after that, but the bullet went straight through my jaw and missed my brain. 

I want to go back to my old life - Hell I want to go all the way back to day one and do it all again, but I'd settle for just a day. 

I used to think I had nothing left to hope for. I used to think I wasn't afraid of anything. Now I know I was wrong about both, and that they're both the same thing: 

The static sneer, half-contempt, half-agony, glitching on my [father's face](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade).

---

Update edit: Everything seems real, but I keep seeing glitches. I can't tell whether this is real and the visual anomalies are a result of my fit, or whether I'm still trapped in the virtual world. 

If it IS real though, then I've killed my brother. If it isn't, then I might be trapped here forever. I don't even know which I'm more afraid of.

<TEXT> College is the time for experimentation. And no, I don't mean titrating sodium hydroxide with hydrochloric acid in chemistry. I mean forcing yourself to try new things - things that excite you - things that *scare* you - for how else are we supposed to discover who we are and what we're capable of without constantly pushing the boundaries of our reality? 

At least, that's the excuse my boyfriend Mike came up with when he suggested a threesome. 

"Sure," I replied. 

"Really? Wow, okay. You're the coolest girlfriend ever -" 

"What's the other guy's name?" 

I knew what he meant, but I still enjoyed watching him choke on the soda he was drinking. Mike had been talking a lot about Amy since she joined our lab group in anatomy. I was jealous at first, but after checking out the competition, I had to concede his point. It was hard *not* watching the supple curves of her body everyday as she stripped her sweater over her head to put her lab coat on. I guess I was just relieved Mike was talking to me about it instead of doing something with her behind my back. 

He wanted me to broach the subject with her because "it sounded less creepy coming from a girl", so I invited her to join Mike and I for drinks after class. 

"Have you ever done anything with a girl before?" I asked Amy after our third beer. Mike spluttered in his drink and excused himself to go to the bathroom, and I almost threw the rest of my glass after him. This was his idea. It wasn't fair making me do all the work. Luckily, there wasn't much work that needed doing. 

"Not yet," she replied, a smile playing around the corner of her lips. 

Two hours later, all of us were in my room trying to figure out how one person fits in a dorm-room bed, let alone three. It was exciting for me, and I can only imagine how many flashing lights and alarms were blaring inside Mike's head, so I guess it was understandable that he spent most of the time focused on Amy. Besides, Mike and I were already comfortable with each other, so it was really just her that he felt the need to impress. Afterward he said it wasn't the case, but I still remember spending way too long hanging out and watching them go at it. I even left to use the bathroom at one point without either of them noticing I was gone. 

I didn't want to get mad. I had agreed to this after-all, and I hated the idea of being one of those infamous girlfriends who said one thing and did another. I just wanted to get *even*. It didn't help that he started acting cocky afterward, as though that experience made him a *big man* or something. He even started pointing out particularly geeky looking freshman and saying things like "I bet he's never even been with one, let alone *two*". 

Although asking for another guy started out as a joke, I started pushing for it more seriously. I wanted him to feel what it was like to be jealous. I wanted him to appreciate what I had done for him and realize I was the only one of us who had the power to make it happen again. And yeah, if I'm being honest, maybe I even wanted to humiliate him a little so he'd go back to regular old Mike and drop this macho facade.  

We started having fights about it, and the more he said no, the more one-sided our relationship seemed. I told Amy I thought I was going to have to dump him (she and I still hung out sometimes, although I never invited Mike when we did). I told her it wasn't her fault, but she still felt guilty about getting between us (literally). That's why she came up with a solution: 

"I know a place where they do it in a group. You'll get your kinks out, he'll have someone of his own to have fun with, and everyone is wearing a mask so nobody gets hurt."  

---

*Big rubber animal masks*. Didn't it get hot in there? I felt more than a little exposed wearing my stupid Mardi Gras mask I picked up at the dollar store on the way here. Everyone else's mask was hyper-realistic and covered their entire head, but they told me not to worry about it and just relax. Mike and I were just "initiates" on a trial run anyway. If we decided this was our thing and we respected all of their rules and members, then they'd give us a full mask next time. 

At first I stuck pretty close to Mike, and we just fooled around with each other and watched. There was about a dozen people in total, and the teeming mass of bodies was pretty damn intimidating to approach. Several of them had covered their bodies in some kind of paint or oil, and they churned and writhed against each other with an almost animalistic intensity. Everywhere I looked, breasts were heaving, indiscriminate hands clutched and pulled on skin, and bodies lunged hungrily at one another as though nourished by their carnal lust.  

I was about to call it quits and leave when a man in a panther-mask pulled away from the others to approach me. His body was chiseled and slick with paint. Mike and I exchanged glances. Isn't this what I wanted? I pointed him in the direction of a leopard-mask with fiery red hair spilling out beneath it. He hesitated, so I gave him a little shove. If nothing else, this would be a shared experience we could laugh and bond over, and maybe we'd both be stronger for it. 
 
I still shuddered a bit when the panther-man put his hand on my shoulders from behind, but his probing fingers expertly massaged down my back and I felt myself melt into his touch. 

---

Mike left shortly after that. We'd only been there about a half-hour, and I was really (*really*) starting to enjoy myself when I saw him staring at me and the panther-man. Good, let him see! But then he just turned around and walked away, and my satisfaction quickly drained. I followed him, and we had another fight in the hallway while we were both still naked. He said he couldn't even look at me again after seeing me like that. Somehow the fact that he was more hurt and sensitive than me *proved* that he cared more about me than I did him, so it was over. He got dressed and left, and I just stood there overflowing with frustration.

I felt massaging hands caressing my shoulders again, and I immediately felt the tension flowing out through them. If I was looking for a rebound to get past Mike, then I couldn't think of a more immersive, therapeutic one than this. I allowed the panther-man to lead me back into the room. The lights had dimmed since I was gone, but a lot of the paint people wore was glowing in the dark. More hands grabbed me, and I allowed myself to be swallowed up in the psychedelic dance of skin on skin, swirling colors, and the growing moan which encompassed me. 

As the night went on, the lights continued to slowly dim. The colors grew brighter, and the intensity of the sound and insistence of the sensation mounted into a crescendo of pleasure. I spent most of my time with the panther-man, although I allowed myself to be passed from one person to the next without complaint. There was no embarrassment, no judgement, no jealousy, only the acceptance and triumph of our shared celebration of life.  

I was back with the panther-man now, body flooded with gentle warmth and satisfaction. His hands were so powerful yet gentle, and his low moans resonated with my own as though we were a single being harmonized with itself. The thought of leaving here and never knowing who was - perhaps never even meeting him again - was more agonizing than I could have imagined. I felt an overpowering desire to look at the man pressed against me - just for a second - just long enough to recognize him if we met again. I slid my hands up his neck and tenderly slipped the mask further up his face... 

But it wouldn't come off. I pulled harder, and felt the strain of living fur beneath my fingers. He grunted in pain - or was that a snarl? - and I pushed him off me. Suddenly every sound came to its height and the mounting carnal cacophony enveloping me became tainted with other sounds.  

Were those moans? Or was someone starting to howl? And then a yelping joined in. I thought it was a joke at first, but one by one the people began to bray, bark, hiss, or whatever other sound was appropriate to the mask they wore. The panther-man knelt upon the ground and I saw his muscles coil as though preparing to spring. It was so dark that I could only see the parts of him covered in paint, and from a few steps away he looked more like an abstract painting than a man. 

I ran toward the door, but tripped over a dark form along the way. A multitude of hands clung onto me in the shadows, and then a paw with razor sharp claws tore the skin on my outer thigh. I screamed and pushed onward, but the grips readily released me as though shocked I wasn't appreciating their touch. I made it to the wall, but I couldn't find the door. The panther-man crawled toward me on all fours. Some of the glowing paint was on his skin, but more of it was matted in patches of thick black hair on his body. 

I leaped along the wall looking for the door, ramming against another body and falling to the ground. The half-panther was almost on top of me now, but I couldn't bear to look at him. I closed my eyes and *screamed* for all I was worth. 

"Are you okay? What are you doing?" 

I opened my eyes. The lights were on. Everyone was staring at me. The panther-man with his chiseled *human* body was standing over me. He pulled on his furry ear, and I almost screamed again before seeing the rubber mask slide easily off. He was a handsome man, about thirty, with strong cheek bones and deep concerned eyes. 

I ran out the door and dressed in the hallway. The panther-man started to follow me.

"Stop her! She's seen too much!" he shouted, his voice a harsh guttural snarl completely unlike the one he used a moment before. 

A woman in a sheep's mask held him back. "Let her go. She'll come back when she's ready." The voice sounded familiar. Was that Amy? I didn't stay long enough to find out. As soon as my clothes were even halfway on, I ran. 

---

I'm not going back. I can't go back. But maybe I'll have to, because I still need answers. I missed my period the next month, but I tried not to think back to that night. I was on the pill and they all had protection. Just to be safe, I got a pregnancy test, but it came up negative. 

I kept testing every month after that. Still nothing. But all the symptoms were beginning to show: I'm swelling up, I'm tired all the time, I'm nauseous in the mornings. I got an ultrasound, but the doctor said he didn't see anything. It's just like a great, empty pit is growing inside of me. I got a few other scans, but nothing came up and the doctor just thinks its a hysterical-pregnancy which will pass on its own. 

I didn't know how to tell him I thought it was something else, just like I didn't know how to explain the claw scars on my outer thigh. 

I want to forget it ever happened, but it's hard when I keep feeling something *scratching* me [from the inside](http://tobiaswade.com/horror-blog).

<TEXT> I'm going to tell you a few things about me. When I was a kid, I lost in the finals of a state tennis championship because I told the truth about a line call when I didn't have to. I once climbed a tree to get somebody's cat down, then stayed up there the rest of the night just because it was so peaceful. My favorite food is strawberries and cream, only I don't tell the other guys because they'd give me shit for it. 

I also joined the 18th Street Gang when I was in the sixth grade. It's important what order I tell you these things, because the moment someone notices my blue and black bandanna, they think they already know everything about me. 

I'm a sophomore in high-school now, and last night was my first break-in. "Spike", an old-school Mexican Mafia type, was there to show me the ropes. He taught me how to map out the regular patrol routes of officers, and how to hide in a concrete drain pipe to avoid being seen. 

I'd never stolen anything bigger than a candy bar before. I was scared as Hell, but I knew Spike was tight with everybody and would tell them how I did. This was my first real chance to let everyone decide what I was made of, and I wasn't going to screw it up. 

"Let's not do this one, it has an alarm system." Middle-class suburban home with a white-picket fence - nothing that screamed a good target to me. 

"Doesn't matter when they let you in," Spike said. He grinned. Just because I'm in a gang doesn't mean I understand gold teeth. They're disgusting.  

"But someone's here. There's a light on up there!" I protested. "Let's keep looking." Maybe if we didn't find a good target tonight, we could just go back and play pool and try again another night. I'd be ready another night. 

"How are they gonna open the door if they ain't home? Fuck's sake," he said. Spike walked around the house and turned the garden hose on full blast. He found two more taps along the back of the house and turned those on too. 

He waited a few minutes for a lake to start forming in the yard before ringing the door bell. I wanted to stop him, but I was frozen. My heart beat faster with each light that turned on as the resident approached his front door. 

"Who is it?" someone yelled from inside. 

"Excuse me sir," Spike shouted. "I noticed one of your pipes burst. Just thought you should know." 

The door opened. An old man - at least 80 - stood there in his bathrobe. I never want to get that old where my eyes shrink down to little pin-pricks and my skin hangs in loose folds like that. Spike gave me a grotesque wink. 

"It did? Oh God," the old man said. 

"Yeah, look at all that water," Spike said. "I was just walking on the sidewalk with my kid," he wrapped his arm around my shoulder and fought the urge to pull away from his sticky-sweet odor of dried sweat. 

"Yo," I said.

"We found which one it was, here come take a look," Spike didn't even wait for a reply. I wonder how many times he's done this before. The old man pulled his bathrobe tighter and followed Spike around the side of the house. 

I wanted to warn him. To tell him to run - to hide and lock the door. I couldn't turn my back on my own though. If this was going to happen anyway, I might as well be the one to return with some glory. The moment the old man passed me by, I picked up a rock from his yard and **SMASHED** it straight into his temple. He crumpled to the ground like a bag of dirt.

Gold teeth flashed. "Nice one kid. Now let's drag him inside so we can take our time with the place." 

I propped him up against the wall in the living room. He was still breathing, but there was a lot of blood coming from his head. I thought about bandaging him up, but I didn't know if that would seem like a sign of weakness. I just wanted to get in and get out as fast as I could.

*Snarl. Woof woof woof woof*.

"Shit, there's a dog," Spike grunted. 

The sound was coming from behind a closed door down a few concrete steps - probably leading to the basement. 

"It can't get at us," I said. "Let's ignore it." 

"Nah, too much noise. Quick, go deal with it," he said.

"Deal with it?" I didn't want to hear him explain. He didn't say a word, but that flash of gold and the knife he handed me - that was even worse. 

"Make it quick. You're gonna be a man after tonight." 

I gripped the knife in my hand so hard my knuckles turned white. I turned away from Spike so he wouldn't see me shaking. 

"I'm gonna go check upstairs for a safe or somethin," Spike said. "Or cash under the mattress - these old shits think that's safer than a bank sometimes. That thing better be quiet by the time I get up there." 

I wasn't worried about it being a big dog. An old guy like this probably had a poodle or something, but hurting any animal has always been off-limits for me. Being loyal to my colors over my own instinct - there wasn't any going back from this. I hated myself for opening the door.

I was tense and ready for it to spring at me. I even slashed the air with the knife a couple of times until I found the light switch. I didn't see anything but a set of stairs though, so I walked down to find the miserable creature. 

*Snarl. Woof woof woof woof.*

"Why is it still barking?" I heard from upstairs. 

"I don't know," I shouted back. 

I was staring face to face with a grown man, probably around fifty years old, stripped down to his underwear and shackled to the wall with iron clasps around his wrists and ankles. His facial hair was thick and greasy, and it was matted in with the long unkempt black hair spilling from his head. 

*Snarl. Woof woof.* 

The man barked at me like an animal. He pulled against the metal restraints as he tried to dive at me, snapping his jaw and frothing into his beard. Then there was a flash of recognition in his eye and he pressed himself back against the wall. His mouth contorted awkwardly, almost as though he was trying to say something. 

"Don't make me come down there and do it for you," Spike said. His voice was closer now, like he was coming back downstairs.  

I dropped the knife and ran. I don't know what the Hell was going on, I didn't care what was going to happen to me, I could not be in that room. Spike was waiting for me outside the basement. 

"What's going on? Did you do it?" 

I just kept running. Straight out the door. I ran the whole 3 miles back to my house without even stopping. Spike followed me out - I don't think he ever saw the thing. He must have told the other guys, because I got a 18 second beating for what happened. I took it like a man. I didn't even make a sound. 

I didn't tell anyone what I saw, or what I heard the thing say as I was leaving. 

*"Kill... me..."*

---

Spike was waiting for me when I got off the school-bus today. He wrapped his arm around my shoulders and led me away from the other kids. I flinched when he touched me. 

"Last night..." he said.

"I'm sorry. I messed up. It's my fault," I replied. I'd already taken the beating. What more could happen?

"I get it, first time is scary. But facing that fear, that's what makes a man out of you," he said. "I checked up on the house, and there wasn't any police report or anything. The old guy was dead, but nobody's found him yet." 

"Did you look in the basement?" I asked. 

"Nah, I didn't stay, but the two of us are going back tonight. We're gonna finish the job." 

How could I tell him? It would just sound like a lame-ass excuse. He'd just think I was scared, and I'd get beaten again. I just nodded. There wasn't any way out of this for me. I've already killed a man, so what's so much worse about [killing an animal](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade).

The book was *breathing*. That was the first thing I noticed when I entered the back room of the National Library of Sweden. 

I hadn't expected Dr. Beckel to call me until the morning, but my restless slumber was disturbed in the dead of night by a phone call. 

"Hello? Hello? Everything okay?" I asked. What respectable person would call after midnight except in an emergency? 

"Yes indeed. Come join me, will you?" 

"Who is this? What time is it?" I asked. 

"It's Dr. Beckel, and it's imperative you come at once." 

The line went dead. I squinted against the harsh light from my screen. **1 AM**. A text message flashed the library's address. Then another containing a mapped route. I set my phone down, but it kept beeping and flashing. 

*Pass-codes to enter the building.* 

*Floor directory inside the building.* 

*Combination of the backroom vault where the book was.* 

I tried calling him again, but it just went to voicemail. He had evidently planned this out quite extensively. A looming dread hung about me while I stumbled about the room getting dressed. What emergency could possibly arise from a book? Unless of course the legends were true... 

By the time I arrived at the library, I had fully convinced myself against the absurd idea. I didn't see any security on the way in, so I figured Dr. Beckel had dismissed them for the evening and invited me now so I wouldn't be seen. Perhaps it was against their regulations to allow an outsider into the vault, and he was simply extending a courtesy to me for discovering the artifact. 

Of course, we had enigmatically parted with him saying "to greet him with me", but even that could be an awkward translation for 'seeing the book'. Dr. Beckel was kind enough to speak in English for my benefit, so I couldn't hold an odd turn-of-phrase against him. 

I knew the book was inside even as I approached the door. The air was somehow tangible as though resisting my advance, and a compulsion set about me to run without cause. I typed the vault combination into the keypad and opened the door, and I was shocked to find my fingers stiff as though frostbitten by cold.  

Dr. Beckel was standing over a steel table with the massive tome opened before him. I didn't get a true sense of the thing's scale from a page, but weighing in at 165 pounds, measuring almost 3x2 feet across, and stitched with the skin from over 150 different donkeys, the Codex Gigas was truly the most magnificent book I have ever encountered. 

Oh, and it was *breathing*. The pages fluttered softly up and down in the dead air, and I could feel my own breath and heart automatically resonate and match the even pulses. The sensation of a nameless terror was even stronger up close, almost as though I just remembered I was being chased while not being able to recall who or what was pursuing me. 

"It's beautiful - isn't it?" Dr. Beckel asked, not taking his eyes off the book. His words came in short, halting bursts as they too matched the pulsing rhythm. "It thanks - you for the - missing page." 

"What is - going on?" I tried to force myself to take a deep breath, but it caught in my throat and expelled involuntarily in time with the rhythm. 

Dr. Beckel closed the Codex and the intensity of its presence immediately lessened. He turned towards me with a maniacal gleam in his eye almost as terrifying as the book. 

"Do you know what is so fascinating about Herman the Recluse?" His words slurred over one another in their haste, and I didn't have the chance to respond. "Not the desperate plight he found himself in - not that he wrote this - not even that his soul is still bound within its pages. What is *truly* remarkable about Herman, is that when he called out in the blackest night of his need, he found a voice who answered." 

"But how do you know about his soul? What has it - has *he* told you?" 

"He told me he wants out - that he is ready to make a deal again," Dr. Beckel said, tenderly running his hands down the book's spine. "Only he has nothing left to offer the Devil, so he has made a deal with me instead."

"I don't understand what any of this has to do with me," I replied. If he was just trying to show off, then I've seen enough. 

"But it has everything to do with you!" Dr. Beckel practically shrieked. "I need Herman to tell me how he struck a deal with Lucifer, and Herman needs a body to bind his soul and escape the book. Naturally I couldn't offer my own, but you, my dear dear fellow, have a perfect vessel for his use." 

Beckel opened the book again now, and my heart ached as it strained to race in conflict with the encompassing rhythm. The words *burned* upon the page as though written in fire, and though I urged my body to retreat toward the door, I found my feet jolting inexorably forward with each gasping breath. 

I struggled helplessly as Dr. Beckel whipped a butterfly knife from his pocket. I tried to lurch out of his reach, but only fell sprawling on my back as my feet continued relentlessly plodding toward the book. I needn't have worried though, because Dr. Beckel hadn't intended to use the knife on me. 

I watched from the ground as he drew the blade across his own palm, spilling his blood freely over my reclaimed page. The thick drops *sizzled* on the paper like water does on a hot pan, and a cloud of bloody must pervaded the air.  

"The deal is struck," Dr. Beckel grunted through the pain. "Take your prize, and then deliver mine."  

The odor from the red mist stung my eyes and blurred my mind. The sound of his voice was like an avalanche, and the intolerable *pulse* from the heaving book dominated my thoughts until my entire world existed in each beat; each pause between was a vacuous nightmare of suspense and anticipation. 

I didn't exactly *see* what happened after that, but I could sense it as though imagining a scene from a book. I felt my body - what used to be my body anyway - standing up from the floor to stagger across the room. I felt Dr. Beckel embrace him and help him stand.

"Take your time, Herman," Dr. Beckel said. "It's been 900 years since you last walked, you might have forgotten a thing or two." 

"Is that long?" I heard my own voice reply. "That is no greater span than an hour in Hell, just as infinite suffering cannot be halved. Eternity then has come and gone, and my pact with Lucifer is at last resolved." 

Dr. Beckel opened the door. I tried to shout - to move - but I had no body left to fight against my prison. 

"Eternity is nothing to me if it means I can wield the Devil's hand. You will show me the rite you called him by?" 

"If I have learned anything from my ordeal," Herman said from my body, "it is the power of one's word. I shall give unto you what is promised, but we must first gather some ingredients for the ritual." 

I have never felt such abject anguish as watching my body leave me. I could not *feel* pain as I did when I was alive, no receptors or frayed nerves registered my dire situation, but I was overcome with a spiritual torment which crushed my every perception. In that moment, every good memory of my life was tainted: every smile was twisted, every affection insincere, and every triumph or pride I ever possessed was altered to feature my shame and self-loathing. I felt as though I must have lived the most despicable life in the history of man, but even knowing it was over brought me no relief because I knew I must spend eternity now recalling and obsessing over my misery. I felt I must be destined to wait until unknown eons brought the human race crumbling into death around me, and still I would be bound to sit alone and dwell upon my grief. 

I don't know how much time passed in such a miserable state, but I blessed the disruption of the opening door as though it were an Angel come to rescue me. The bespectacled man from the book fair, now carrying a large backpack, crept into the room to regard me. He walked effortlessly up to the steel table as though unaffected by the book's preternatural presence to close my cover. Instantly I felt some degree of sanity and stability return, and I held onto my conscious spark for all I was worth. 

**Can you hear me?** I screamed in my mind. **Herman has stolen my body! I'm trapped in here!**

"Henry. Henry Iggins," he replied. Presumably his name, Henry withdrew an identical Codex Gigas from his backpack and laid it upon the table. He then picked me up and secured me in the pack. 

**What?**

 "Yes yes, I can hear you. Now where did they go?" 

**To gather ingredients for a rite to summon Lucifer, but I don't know what-**

"Not to worry, I'll handle it from here. Come now, we're going to get your body back.** 

**Why are you helping me?**

"Because Dr. Beckel stole something from me," his narrowed eyes flashed dangerously behind his spectacles, "and that was a very foolish thing to do." 

---

Henry Iggins moved with the vitality of a much younger man. I could sense my surroundings around the backpack and felt him carry me to one obscure shop after another. I couldn't quite make out where these places were, but none of them had any signs or banners to distinguish their unusual wares: the hand of a nun, skeletal fragments from dead kings, and a cat which had been skinned and turned inside out, to name just a few. 

Henry conversed rapidly with each shop owner in an unfamiliar tongue before moving onto the next. After three or four such shops, he seemed to receive an answer which satisfied him, prompting us to take a cab out of town. 

**What are you going to do when you find him?** 

"That depends how quick we are. If he has already finished the ritual, then it will be up to him to decide what will happen next."

**Do you have any idea why he wants to make a pact with Lucifer?** 

"Not precisely, but I am familiar with his type. No doubt some short-sighted, selfish goal that will not bring him half the satisfaction he is anticipating." 

**But you weren't going to use the book for the same thing, were you?** 

"Do I look like a fool? Perhaps I do, but that is a fault of my years and not my sensibilities. No, I simply want to make him pay. *No-one* steals from me." 

---

My ordinary senses might be clouded, but I could feel the the ritual in progress like a black-lighthouse drawing me through the woods. Henry trusted my directions as I navigated through the dense pine trees which huddled so close together as to block out the sky. As I drew near, I could feel the rhythm of my own *pulse* harmonize with the presence. My conscious thoughts were devoured by the beat, and I must have lost consciousness for a moment because suddenly I was in a clearing of trees inside a large circle of salt upon the ground. 

"Who are you? What are you doing here?" Dr. Beckel asked. He was standing with Herman who knelt with a bloody butcher's knife. Rolls of yellowed parchment lay as bedding for a headless goat which stained the paper deep scarlet. 

"I hope I didn't interrupt anything," Henry Iggins said. 

"That man from the book fair -" Dr. Beckel choked in disbelief. "And what have you got there?"

"It does not matter," Herman said. "The ritual is complete. Lucifer arrives." 

I strained to feel if anything had changed. The presence which drew me here had lifted. The pulsing was all but gone. Dr. Beckel glanced anxiously around him, while Herman remained kneeling with his head bowed in silent reverence.

"You tricked me," Dr. Beckel snarled. "Where is he? Why don't I see him?" 

"*He is already here,* Herman replied. 

Henry Iggins shrugged and put down the backpack. "Satan sum et nihil humanum a me alienum puto. Game is up, boys. But you didn't need all that mumbo jumbo to bring me here. If you want my attention, all you have to do is steal from me."

He didn't feel any different, but there was something about the tone of Henry's voice which left no doubt in my mind. The words carried a certain *weight* as though gravity itself would stop to listen to what he said. I had spent the afternoon with the Devil without even realizing it. 
 
"Herman and I had a deal," Henry continued, and I know the same presence must be weighing on the others for they let him speak without interruption. "His soul was mine from the moment I bound it within the Codex Gigas, and by setting him free you have stolen him from me. I DO NOT LIKE. BEING STOLEN FROM." The last words bellowed from all directions like the forest itself was screaming. 

Dr. Beckel fell to his knees from the impact of that voice, but he immediately reclaimed his footing.

"Take him back, I don't care," Beckel said. "You and I have a deal though, don't we? I called and you answered. You shall serve me if you want my soul too." 

"First things first," Henry said. He snapped his fingers and I coughed blood. Both events happened simultaneously. One instant I was inside the book, the next I was kneeling in the circle beside Dr. Beckel. *Back in my own body.* 

"Enough!" Dr. Beckel screamed. "Now for my wish, Lucifer. I want you to let all the sinners out of Hell and bring them here to Earth. I want your army of the damned to obey my orders and serve me until my dying breath. Until the day you return to claim my soul, I do not want to see you again." 

Henry laughed - long peels of sardonic laughter which reverberated down into my bones. A cold wind whistled through the trees, making the whole forest seem to be laughing alongside him. Dr. Beckel gripped the knife tighter in his hand, looking as though he were about to *lunge* at Henry. "The rite is complete. We have a deal, Lucifer!" 

"Don't worry, the damned will be here soon enough," Henry said. "They will rise with the coming of **The Beast**. But Herman never made a deal with Lucifer - there is no Lucifer. When he called out in the night, it was *I* who answered, and I do not serve man."

"What are you?" Dr. Beckel dropped once more to his knees. "How are you even in this world if it was not from my summons?" 

"*The Second Demon Seed* has grown ripe within me," Henry said, "and so I have returned. Five more to go before **The Beast** arrives." 

Dr. Beckel growled in exasperation and leaped at Henry. The bespectacled man waved his hand and a searing flame engulfed the librarian. I watched transfixed as Beckel's skin melted off like running water, revealing bones splitting from the heat and clouds of evaporating blood and marrow which filled the air. Henry turned his gaze toward me where I still knelt in the circle. He grinned sheepishly like a school-boy who was caught misbehaving. 

"Thank you for your help. I have already replaced the Codex with a fake, so you may keep the real one for your trouble."

"You aren't going to hurt me?" I asked. I had so many more questions, but that was all I could force out of my dry mouth. 

"Of course not. I still need you," he said. "I need you to spread the fear of what is fated until mankind screams with one voice, so that together we may welcome his rise."

---

I still have the Codex Gigas, although I can't imagine how I will smuggle it out of the country when I'm returning to the States next week. After knowing what it is like, I feel terrible for Herman now trapped inside once more. I considered burning the cursed tome, but somehow the weight of its presence and its connection with that Demon makes me believe it still has a role to play. Perhaps I will simply hide it until the the time of **The Beast** [has begun](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/674eel/breaking_and_entering_hell/).

<TEXT> 1) It's common for children to inherit their family's possessions and pawn them off without either party knowing their value. 
2) My guess is that he mistook it for a cheap poster or reproduction, although the unnatural presence of the thing probably accounted for both his interest and quick decision to get rid of it. 
3) The page is about 3x2 feet, the largest medieval manuscript ever made. Combined with its vellum material and my familiarity with the style from research, it wasn't a difficult identification. 
4) Pages of such iconic books often run for that price. Compare with the [guttenberg bible](http://www.greatsite.com/ancient-rare-bible-leaves/gutenberg-1455-leaf.html) which often reaches 100k per page, and there are multiple copies of that unlike the Codex Gigas. 
Hope that helped your confusion. Cheers </TEXT>

<TEXT> Allow me to take you on a journey with me to Stockholm Sweden, where the 2017 International Antiquarian Book Fair is currently in progress. Cases of illuminated manuscripts, first editions of classical masterpieces, original drafts and letters in the genius's own hand, and of course the omnipresent odor of old leather and paper. 

Yes there are similar book fairs held all over the world, but this one is singular because of the invaluable artifact I am carrying in my possession: a lost page from the [The Codex Gigas](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Devil_codex_Gigas.jpg/500px-Devil_codex_Gigas.jpg). 

The Codex has long held fascination for me since I discovered the legends surrounding its mysterious origin. The bible was created in a 12th century Benedictine monastery in Bohemia, now part of the Czech Republic. It was written by the monk known as Herman the Recluse who reportedly broke his monastic vows and was sentenced to be walled alive inside the monastery as punishment. 

In a desperate attempt to avoid his fate, Herman offered to write a book containing all human knowledge in a single night in exchange for leniency. Herman attempted this impossible task, but his prayers for divine assistance were ignored. As a last resort, the monk offered a prayer to Lucifer who agreed to finish the book in exchange for his soul. The monk added [this picture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Codex-Gigas-Devil-enhanced.jpg/340px-Codex-Gigas-Devil-enhanced.jpg) of the Devil in gratitude for his aid. 

Since its creation, the book has traveled thousands of miles as it has been lost, traded, stolen, and handed down through the generations. The book was damaged when it was plundered in Sweden's 30 year war before reaching its final destination in the National Library of Sweden. Although some of the lost pages have been recovered, many more were destroyed or secretly coveted within private collections around the world. 

So you can imagine my excitement when I stumbled upon one of the pages being offered in a pawn shop adjacent to a used microwave and a doll house. The owner didn't have the faintest idea what it was, but he said he was happy to get rid of it because of the oppressive atmosphere which seemed to surround it.  

"Makes the whole place feel like a graveyard somehow," he told me. "Beautiful on the surface, but you can't enjoy it proper on account of what's underneath." 

The moment I touched the page, I understood what he meant. It was as though the lights in the shop dimmed, although I could still see with perfect clarity. It is difficult to describe, but imagine shutting off the lights the same instant you developed the ability to see in the dark. I attributed this to a fanciful imagination born from those old legends however, and I didn't let it disturb my alacrity at such a valuable discovery. 

The Latin text was indecipherable to me, but I figured it was just more psalms and could be translated at the ongoing book fair. I brought my prize inside and quickly found a vendor willing to exhibit the page for 125,000$ in exchange for a commission. The page wasn't on display for more than five minutes before a small crowd had already begun to form. 

"I'll take it for 100,000," an elderly man said. He wasn't so much wearing spectacles as they were wearing him, and I could barely see his face through the massive lenses. 

"110,000," from an woman wearing so many furs that I shouldn't be surprised if she started howling. 

"Don't sell it yet - wait for the representative from the National Library," from a third, rushing off through the fair to find him.  

I readily obliged, my mind already tracing a hundred ways for me to spend my new-found fortune. I expected a fussy old librarian to come and try to convince me to donate my find, so I mentally prepared myself to negotiate against the growing number of bids. It took a moment before I recognized the tall man in a suit who returned to be the librarian. His keen blue eyes, long blonde pony-tail, and hard uncompromising jaw did not fit the stereotypical profile.

"200,000 as a final sale," were the first words out of his mouth. The bubbling requests around us immediately died down into a hushed murmur. The librarian ran his fingers expertly over the vellum page as though caressing a loved one. 

"250,000, and you do not consider other bids," the bespectacled man chirped. I couldn't very well ask if anyone could beat it with that stipulation, so I simply raised an eyebrow and waited to see if someone would interject on their own. 

The librarian pulled out his phone and started texting. The phone slid into his pocket, and he put his arm around my shoulders in camaraderie - or at least that's how he no-doubt intended it. The gesture felt more like a car salesman trying to change your mind from a minivan to a sportscar. 

"200 is more than fair, and it would be a national travesty not to have this be reattached to the book it was stolen from." 

He was trying to subtly steer me away from the other bidders, but I held my ground. "I'm sorry, but if that other gentleman is the leading bid -" 

"What other gentleman?" he interrupted. I turned to scan the crowd, but there was no sign of the bespectacled man. 

"Where did he go? He offered 250,000 for -" 

"Oh that old trickster," the librarian said, his grip tightening slightly around my shoulders. "He's been making false bids all night just to get a reaction out of people. Come now, you won't find a better deal than 200 grand." 

I literally paid 80 dollars for the page this morning. I didn't want to get greedy and push my luck, so I agreed. All the proper paperwork was filled out and the exchange was made. The librarian (Dr. Beckel), congratulated me and wrapped his arm around my shoulder once more as we parted.

"Did you feel it? When you touched the page?" Dr Beckel asked in a half-whisper. 

I didn't need to ask for clarification. I just nodded, not wanting to sound foolish by indulging my fantasy. 

"It's nothing compared to the presence of the book. And did you know that it gets stronger with every page that is added?" 

The warm buzz of the book fair faded away around me and I felt a clammy chill dash across my skin. 

"What is causing it?" I asked him. 

"You know," Dr. Beckel grinned. "Would you like to touch the book after your page has been restored and re-inserted?"

"What on Earth for?"  

His smile widened, and he pulled me a little closer against him in his conspiratorial fashion. "To greet him with me, of course."

<TEXT> I'm not quite sure why I was called, but as long as I'm here..

If you're trying to build a fanbase, then I think it's important to keep an archive on a social media site. I've been experimenting with a few different angles, but here's what's working best:

1) [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade) - Share a link every time you post a story, and put a link at the end of each story going back to your fb. The fb fans will help upvote your story and make it more visible, which in turn will bring new people to your page, and so on in a continual feedback loop. Then you can use fb notes or an album for a comprehensive archive. 

That's all you'll really need if you're doing this as a hobby. 

2) [Website](http://tobiaswade.com/horror-blog) - If you want to consider making a career out of writing, I think a website is a must. Once you have a decent fb fanbase, you can start linking your website at the end of stories and directing your fb fans there. Just search youtube for how to make your own wordpress website, and there are some pretty simple tutorials which will guide you step by step. 

Websites are great because they look a bit more professional and will allow you to start monetizing your writing if you want to go that route. A combination of social sharing and naturally generated search engine traffic will help increase your exposure too. You can make use of your traffic with google adsense, affiliate sales, or selling your own published works when you're ready. 

3) [Mailing list](http://eepurl.com/cy-S15) Mailchimp is a great way to create a free mailing list. Used in conjuncture with your website, it can send out automatic RSS updates whenever you post a new story. This has been my best way of gaining long term readers and creating a captive audience to market published works. 

The easier you make it for people to find your work, the more readers you'll get. Good luck! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a two year old son named Alexander. No that's not the horror story, although any new parents out there might beg to differ. He is the most perfect thing I could ever or will ever create, and I love him with all my heart.  

When I look at Alex, I see myself. An entire lifetime of academic achievements, romantic pursuits, dreams and ambitions, and of course the glorious pride of shooting the game winning goal... the infinite potential of his un-lived life is a miraculous blessing that I am privileged to be a part of. 

My wife Stacey thinks I'm going to run myself into the ground trying to be the world's best dad. She thinks I'm overcompensating because my own dad left when I was two. And so what if I am? Dad leaving *destroyed* my mother. It was because of him that I grew up practically impoverished, withdrawn, and angry at the world. What's so wrong with wanting something better for my own son?

I'll admit that I did tend to obsess over the idea though. Everything was a competition - I wanted a better job than my father, to drive a better car; I even started interrogating my mother about all dad's bad habits so I could avoid them, although she replied with something which shocked me. 

"Why don't you ask him yourself? I know where he lives." 

I couldn't even remember the man. Learning he lived just on the other side of town made me furious. I had to know what his excuse was for never being there, and even more than that, I wanted to tell him straight to his face that I wouldn't be the same terrible father he was. 

I was expecting some kind of burnt out crack-den or whore-house, not the luxury high rise apartments that matched the address. Sure my mother lived comfortably now, but somehow I didn't think he *deserved* the same kind of lifestyle now. My fist landed on his door with a quick burst of powerful thumps. 

"Who are -" the man in the loose bathrobe asked, but he didn't even have to finish the sentence. The resemblance was *uncanny*. The long nose, the angular cheeks, the wisps at the end of his eyebrows - he looked *exactly* like an older version of myself. 

"Yeah," I said. All my carefully prepared arguments from the drive over here evaded my mind. All I could think about was how unsettling it felt to look at that face which could have almost been a mirror.  

"Well alright, come on in." He turned around and sat down on his sofa. "Your mother send you?" 

"Do you and her still talk?" I asked. 

He shrugged. "Sometimes. She told me about your kid. Congratulations on -" 

"Why'd you leave?" It wasn't supposed to go like this. I was supposed to be gloating over a successful life he played no part in. He was supposed to be pleading my forgiveness. So why did my voice crack like I was the one begging? 

"The same reason you'll ditch your kid," he said. "They're better off without us." 

---

I left shortly after that, feeling less satisfied than ever. How dare he presume I would make the same terrible decisions he did? Maybe he was right that I was better off without him, but my son needed me and I needed him. 

I gripped my steering wheel so hard my knuckles turned white. How could I possibly be bad for my son? I was so focused that I didn't even notice the car cutting me off. 

"Hey asshole! Get off the road!" I shouted. I never do that sort of thing, but I was so pissed at my dad that everybody better stay out of my way. 

Maybe that's what dad was talking about? If I brought home this kind of anger, then my son would start to internalize it as he grew up. Maybe it was best for me to just stop at the bar before heading home and take some time to cool off... 

---

I couldn't sleep that night. Stacey was mad at me for coming home late. She smelled the alcohol on me, but I didn't want to tell her about my dad because I just wanted to forget about him. *They're better off without us.* Hah! Better off without you. 

But what if there was something more to it? Maybe my father really knew something I didn't - some inherited health problem, or predisposition to an addiction, or Hell I don't know. He didn't seem accusing or angry or anything when he said it. Maybe he was actually trying to warn me. If that was the case, then wasn't I being selfish in putting my own comfort over the security of my family? 

It was 2 in the morning when I knocked on his door again. He opened it wearing the same disgusting bathrobe. 

"Why are they better off without us?" I blurted out. I wanted to cut straight to the point and not give small-talk a chance to sap my anger. 

"Come on in, have a seat."

"I don't want to come in. I want an answer," I said. 

"You smell like booze," he said. "So did I when I went home. Your mother couldn't stand it." 

---

That was it? He was an alcoholic? Well I wasn't. Sure I drank from time to time, but I wouldn't let it ruin my relationship with Stacey like it did with him and my mother. I couldn't stand the sight of him, so I just took off right after he gave me that explanation. 

But Stacey had been upset when she smelled it, so maybe I could still learn from him. I decided to spend the rest of the night at a friend's house so she wouldn't have to see me like this. 

I sent her a text to let her know what I was doing and went over to my buddy Tom. He and I stayed up chatting for awhile, I had a couple more drinks to help me sleep, and then I crashed on his couch. Between the alcohol and knowing I resolved the issue, I slept like a baby through the rest of the night. 

---

I wish I hadn't though, because she was was absolutely *livid*. She wouldn't even let me explain myself. I tried to tell her about my father, but she just thought it was *awfully convenient* considering I hadn't mentioned him yesterday. 

The alcohol - the night out - she was utterly convinced I was cheating. I even tried getting her to talk to Tom, but she wouldn't stop yelling long enough for me to get him on the phone. 

I shouldn't have hit her. I know it was wrong. But I couldn't get her attention, and I was getting so mad at her being mad... shit, I don't know. It wasn't even hard - I just pushed her away from me and she fell over. I was so embarrassed that I just rushed straight out the door. 

Where was I supposed to go though? I didn't want to bring my mother in on this. She had to believe I was the perfect son - the perfect husband that my dad never was. The only person who seemed to understand what I was going through, the only one I wanted to talk to, was my dad. 

**Tap tap tap**. My knock lacked all of the certainty and power it had the first time around. And yeah, maybe he was just going to say something that pissed me off worse, but maybe he'd also remind me about how much worse of a father he was. Compared to him and everything he's done, I'd be able to look at myself and know I wasn't so bad. 

"Tell me everything," I said. 

"Well come on in."

"I don't want to come in. I want to know what made you such a shitty father." 

We stood facing each other through the doorway. He looked worn out, but I must have too after last night. For a second I thought he was going to just close the door in my face, but then he sighed and said: 

"I hit your mother. Are you happy now?" 

"Yeah what else? I want to know everything." My breath was coming in shallow gasps. There had to be more. There had to be something that made this man worse than me. 

"Just leave it alone, will you? It's ancient history," he said. "Either come in or leave, because I don't want to just stand here like a couple of -" 

"I want you to tell me what else you did to us!" I shouted. 

"Yeah, well know what I want?" He said. "I hope when your son comes knocking on your door in twenty some years, you do something I couldn't and break the cycle. I hope you don't answer him." 

He started to close the door. I tried to push my way in, and the door *slammed* on my foot. 

"I'm not you! I'll never be you!" 

He tried to push me back so he could close the door, but I barreled into him and knocked him to the floor. He tried to crawl away, but I straddled him and pinned him to the ground. 

"Get the Hell off me -"

"Not until you tell me what else made you leave."

"It's none of your business -" He tried to sit up, but I forced his head down. *Too hard*. It slammed into the tile floor with a sickening crack, and a pool of blood began to spread out from the wound. He wasn't fighting back anymore. His body felt limp. 

"What did you do? What did you do?" I kept shaking him as though that would wake him up, but all I did was smear the blood around. But there! One of his eyes flickered open for a moment. 

"I swear to God," I said, "if you don't tell me I'll -"

"I killed a man," he grunted. "After that, I couldn't look you or my wife in the eye, so I left." 

"Who?" I asked, but somehow I already knew the answer. 

"He had it coming. For leaving my mother. For leaving me." My grip went slack, but it didn't matter. He couldn't stand anymore. I let him slip to the ground and stared at my bloody hands. 

What son would want a father like this? Maybe he was right. Maybe they are better [off without us](https://redd.it/66r2hk).

<TITLE> Welcome to the Organ Harvesting Club </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-18 21:19:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Growing up, I was one of those kids who could be washed with a fire hose and still have dirt between my toes. Mud was the best toy in the world. I used it like Play-Doh to build entire forts, and my twin sister said she could always tell when I was coming before she saw me because of the *squelching* sound.  

Bugs? Bring it on. I'd eat one for a dollar. Painting? My whole body was both brush and canvas. Maybe you'd find me baking a cake with my sister. We looked almost identical, but you could easily tell us apart because she would be wearing disposable gloves up to her elbow while my whole face was buried in the bowl to lick the batter. 

That's what makes it so unfair that she got sick and I didn't. It started with her feet and ankles swelling up. I thought she was just starting to gain weight, and I forced her to jog with me in the morning before school. She kept trying to push through, but she couldn't keep up with me like she used to. I shouldn't have made her feel bad for it, but I was only 17 then. I thought she just wasn't trying. I didn't understand that she was trying twice as hard as me, or that trying sometimes wasn't enough. 

A month later, she could barely walk without throwing up. She was exhausted and dizzy all the time, and I felt so helpless watching her drift away from me. She was diagnosed with a polycystic kidney disease which was causing both of her kidneys to fail. She tried dialysis for awhile, but it quickly became clear that she was going to need a transplant. 

I didn't even have to think about it. She was my other half. If her body was sick, my body was sick, and if there was something I could do to make her better, then I that was the end of the discussion. It was just bad luck for her to express the inherited condition while I didn't, and it could have just as easily been me. It was going to be a routine enough operation though, and once she had one of my kidneys there was no reason for the cysts to form anymore. We were both going to be okay. Yeah we'd have to be on medications for the rest of our life, but as long as she'd be taking it with me, it would be fair. Besides, what twin doesn't want to have matching scars?   

We were prepared for the surgery together in the same room. We made a game out of drinking the nauseating laxatives which were necessary before the operation: first one to get through it gets to choose which kidney to have. It wasn't even close to fair because she started out nauseous and I had always been the one who could stomach anything, so I made a big show of spitting it up and let her win. Her gloating about beating me was the happiest I had seen her in a long time. 

It was so embarrassing because she wouldn't stop giggling while the male nurse shaved the little hairs on our abdomen. I started laughing too, and the nurse looked so uncomfortable that he had to excuse himself from the room to 'check something'. 

"Come back!" she yelled after him. "We can do you next. It'll be fun!" 

Her smile was glowing despite everything she had to go through. I want to always remember her like that. 

The surgery was terminated half-way through. There had been a complication, and her body had gone into shock the moment her first kidney was removed. They said she woke up for a moment and held my hand right before she went, but they might have just been saying that to try and make me feel better. It didn't work. 

The doctor said I could see the body if I wanted, but what was the point? All I had to do was look in the mirror. All the pain and loss on my face - hers must have looked the same way. Then the doctor leaned in real close - like he didn't want anyone else to hear - and he whispered something to me. 

"Since you're all prepared for the surgery anyway, do you want to still go through with it?" 

"She's gone. What's the point?" 

"There's someone else who is also a match. You could be saving their life instead." 

What did he think this was, a charity? I wasn't just giving organs away. I was only doing this because she was my sister and I would have given anything for her. I wasn't about to risk my life for -

"The recipient is willing to compensate you with 250,000 dollars." 

I choked on my reply. It's amazing how quickly you're able to justify something for that kind of money. I had already been prepared to give it up. Was there really anything wrong with selling it? I would be able to help my family with all the medical costs my sister had wracked up from her illness. Besides that, I would be able to help so many more people...

I nodded. The anesthesia mask went back over my face and I slipped back into oblivion.

---

I didn't tell anyone about the money which was discreetly wired into my bank account. There was an unwholesomeness about it somehow, but maybe that was just because the whole incident was so close to my sister's death. 

I paid off all of my parents bills and told them they were covered by an anonymous donor, which I guess was true. Over the next three years, I funneled the rest into a non-profit organization which helped people get their medical procedures. 

*Three years*. It went fast. I'd expected that kind of money to be able to help people for a lifetime, but people came from everywhere to make use of the fund. 

Co-pay for cancer medications, necessary operations which were denied by insurance, health screenings for those without insurance - three years and the entire 250k was spent. But I received so many letters and gift baskets and people hugging me *sobbing* about how I saved their life. It was a rough estimation, but I figure in that time I saved the lives of at least 30 people. 

*30 people for a kidney!* I was  a 20 year old college girl. There was nothing special about me at all. But knowing that such a small sacrifice had made such a huge impact - I couldn't just stop now. 

I went back to the doctor who performed the operation, and he confided that there was a constant market for other organs. I asked about harvesting from cadavers or something, but he said only live donations or incredibly fresh harvests would bring that kind of money. 

Getting volunteers though? Next to impossible. And it was illegal to advertise buying that sort of thing. Even if I managed to raise awareness about it around campus without getting arrested, then people would probably keep the money for themselves instead of helping others. If I wanted my foundation to continue, I was going to need to get the organs myself. 

It made me angry to even think about how greedy people were. The potential for good each body contained was astronomical. It was selfish - almost criminal to think that they valued their own life over the lives of dozens of others. I had several meetings with the doctor trying to brainstorm ideas to collect, and that's when he told me a secret which he had sworn to keep for life. 

The man who had my kidney killed my sister. He'd paid the nurse 100,000 to do it so he could get my kidney instead. The doctor had found out too late to stop him - his own life was even at risk if he didn't extend the offer to me. 

I finally found the first person to join my Organ Harvesting Club. 

---

I tracked him down with the doctor's help and waited for him to come home. Getting in was easy - I just rang the doorbell and he opened it. 

My plan was just to get information on him and his house on my first visit, but I couldn't hold myself back. His blood was flowing through *my* kidney. My sister's blood was on his hands. I punched him square in the face and tackled him straight to the ground.

He was twice my size, but he was fat and old and I was an animal. If I had prepared better, I wouldn't have gouged my fingers into his eyes (worth 750$ each). I wouldn't have broken his teeth with my elbow (about 1,000$) or spilled so much blood when I slit his throat with my switchblade (337$ a pint). 

I didn't even get his body to the doctor in time to get top dollar on the rest of the organs, but I'll be more careful next time. I expect to get close to 600k for the nurse who killed her.

Can you think of any other club which can potentially save hundreds of lives with each new member that's added? I hope my sister is watching somewhere, and that she knows how much good has come from her death. She can stay pure and clean and perfect, but I was never afraid to [get my hands dirty](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade).

<TEXT> [Part one](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64zq21/everyone_lives_but_not_everyone_dies/) will tell you how I met the mysterious Mr. Jacobs. 

I don't know what that beetle I swallowed was, but it's doing something to me.  

The squirming sensation had abated for awhile, and I figured it would be digested. I wasn't feeling as nauseous anymore, so it probably wasn't poisonous. I told myself he was just some crazy hermit who got his wrinkled old rocks off by playing tricks on people. It wasn't that my Grandmother was afraid of him - she must have just known he was a fraud.  

I was almost home before the sharp pain in my stomach doubled me over the steering wheel. It was like an ice-cold knife trying to force its way out from the inside. I had to pull off into a gas station to wait for it to pass. 

The pain quickly faded into a gentle numbness, the sensation replaced by a gentle tickling working its way up my chest cavity. I lifted my shirt and fought the urge to be sick again. 

*There was a lump under my skin. And it was moving.*

I poked at it gingerly and could feel the hard carapace of the beetle underneath. It must have bitten free from my stomach and begun to crawl around. I briefly considered trying to smash it, but what if I didn't kill it? What if I just made it mad and it went on a rampage *inside of me*?

The lump wasn't moving fast, but it was persistently crawling toward my heart. I took a deep breath and felt it holding onto my rib-cage as it expanded and contracted. 

The hospital. Now. I slowly pulled out of the gas station, trying not to turn the wheel too fast for fear of agitating the beetle. It reacted to even small movements, biting and scratching in protest. I don't care if they made me drink a whole bottle of bleach, I was getting this thing out of me. 

I pulled right up to the emergency room doors and left my car there. I practically had to crawl up to the desk to keep the beetle still. For every foot I made, it was wriggling a few centimeters closer to my heart. What would happen when it got there? 

"Somebody help me!" I shouted, lying down on the ground to keep it still. I stared at my reflection in the polished floor tiles, now damp with the cold sweat flowing down my face. Was I delirious? The face looking up at me couldn't be my own. I was so... old. My hair was grey and patchy, my eyes sunken and hollow, and a network of lines mapped the journeys of an un-lived life. I tried to touch my skin, but the jerking movement caused the beetle to bite down *hard* on one of my lungs. 

I was coughing blood when the nurses lifted me into a stretcher. I slipped in and out of consciousness after that. The nurses later told me that I kept mumbling "I dont want to die. I want to live forever". 

---

Any allergies? 

No.

Medications?

No. 

Please think hard. Its rare for someone your age not to be on *any* medications.*

I glared at the doctor who perched on the end of my hospital bed. I dont know how long Ive been here, but it was afternoon when I went to visit Mr. Jacobs and the morning sun was filling my room. I squinted against it, then back at my doctor. He looked bored and annoyed and fuzzy. I squinted again. 

Im 19 years old, I said. The events of the other day immediately came back to me, and I clutched at my chest. Ancient withered hands held loosely together by a mesh of bulbous veins gripped my hospital gown and pulled it open. I couldnt feel any lump, but was this really me? My skin sloughed into sagging pouches around my skeletal frame. I was more than old. I was what old could only dream about becoming when it grew up. 

Do you remember what year it is? the doctor asked. Dont worry if you cant. Its common with cases of delirium 

Its April 13th, 2017. Im not delirious. Im 19 years old, and was perfectly healthy yesterday. Theres something inside of me which is causing this 

Causing what, exactly?

He was writing something down in his notepad, but he wasnt really listening. He must deal with a dozen old people every day, each more blithering and nonsensical than the last. But if they could find the beetle and reverse this 

I want a full body scan  

Youve already been checked. It was probably nothing but heat exhaustion which caused you to feel dizzy. Id like to keep you here through the afternoon and get you re-hydrated, and then youll be as good as ever. Is there anyone you'd like us to notify?"

"My grandmother." 

He raised a skeptical eyebrow. 

"Just give me the damn phone." 

---

Grandmother Elis and I stared at each other. She recognized me the moment she walked in the door. She didn't say a word - just pursed her lips and sat down. She opened her handbag and began fiddling with something inside. 

"I'm sorry..." I said. This was all my fault. I should have asked her before visiting Mr. Jacobs. I should never have gone through her stuff in the attic without permission, or pretend I was supposed to accept Mr. Jacob's offer on her behalf. 

She took out a hand-mirror from her purse and held it up to me. I screwed my eyes shut tight. 

"Look at what you've become."

I forced myself to look. If I - the old me - had seen someone who looked like I did now, I would have made some cruel joke about old people 'outliving their usefulness'. Now I felt like I wanted to cry, if these puffy old eyes could even do that anymore. 

"My Grandfather doesn't know how to extend life," Elis said. "He shifts it from one person to another. The only reason he has lasted this long is because he passes his years into a victim who must bear his burden in his stead."

"So the reason you never accepted his offer..."

"Because I couldn't do that to someone else. One lifetime is more than enough if used properly, and a thousand lives aren't nearly enough when used as has done." 

"But I only want one life, I swear," I said. "And I can get it back, right? All I have to do -" 

"No. You do not have the right to give your years to anyone." 

"But I could give them back to Mr. Jacobs."

She shook her head. "You will not win. He has been doing this for over a hundred years. If you go back to him, he will only add to your years until you've been turned to dust." 

"He told me not to return without you. If you accept his deal -" 

Grandmother Elis put her mirror away. I hated how much her hands were shaking. 

"I'm sorry. I can't do it." 

"Please don't leave me like this..." I said. 

"There's hardly anything left of you to leave," and she was gone. 

I wanted to say more, but my words caught on a dry itching in my throat. I felt like I was suffocating, and if that had been the end, I would have accepted it. I'd rather die than live like this. But the itching turned into squirming, and the squirming into thrashing. I clutched at my throat, but I was helpless as the beetle crawled up my trachea and out of my mouth. It plopped down into my lap, and I held it in my hands. 

But these weren't my years - this wasn't my fault. If I could just pass them off to someone else, then...

*I'd rather die than live like this,*

*but I'd rather [live forever](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade) than either.*

<TITLE> The 32 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-12 19:55:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A lot of you probably know about the Chilean mining accident of 2010. It was also called the "Los 33" because of the 33 miners trapped underground. It's amazing that all 33 survived the entire 69 days it took until they were rescued.

There was a whole media circus about it with an estimated billion people watching the rescue on TV or the internet. There was so much news that one fact was completely drowned out - and to me, it's the most important of them all.

I became interested in the topic because of a school paper I was writing. I mentioned the project to my grandfather (which was a terrible mistake because he is ZEALOUS about school). He was trying to get my mother to enroll me in an international baccalaureate college prep school at FIRST GRADE. Education is my future - he wishes he had those opportunities when he was a kid - I'm an ungrateful brat for taking my fortune for blessing - you know the drill.

Anyway, he wouldn't let me use wikipedia or any easy source for the essay. Instead, he called up his old friend who actually worked on the rescue crew in Chile. So what should have been an hour long paper turned into an hour phone interview, three hours of driving, and a whole BOOK about rescue operations. Who since the internet was invented ever needed to read a book about anything?

Meeting the rescue worker guy was pretty interesting though. He had tan leather skin like you'd expect to find on a car seat instead of a person. His accent was a little thick, and sometimes he couldn't find the right word so he had to switch to Spanish. I know next to zero Spanish, but my grandfather would make me write down everything he said verbatim so I could translate it at home. Granddad literally said "If you try to take the easy road in life, life is going to take the easy road with you. Right up your ass". I don't know what that means, but asking him to clarify didn't seem necessary. 

About half-way through the interview with the rescue guy, My grandfather got up to go to the bathroom. I was asking questions about how many people were down there, and he kept saying "treinta-y-dos", or 32. The movie is even called "The 33" - everything online says "The 33", but he was adamant. Then he gave me this weird look - like he was shell-shocked or something. The kind of blank look you expect to see holocaust survivors wearing. He leaned in real close and started rattling off some stuff in English and some in Spanish, and I did my best to keep up.

It wasn't until the car ride home when I was able to translate what he said. I checked it half a dozen times - I even ran the transcript by my Grandfather (who is fluent, but still made me do my own translating first). Here is what we put together:

*"All the media - the news - the story spinners - they all say 33 miners were trapped. And why wouldn't they? 33 people came out of that mine. The miners were trapped 700 meters in the ground - there was no way in or out. But the miners who come out - right when I first pull them out - they all say the same thing.*

*There were only 32 miners trapped. They count and they count - every day - every few hours so everybody taken care of - and then one day they count again and there is 33.*

*They were a band of brothers - you can't go through an ordeal like that and not become family - and they stuck by each other. They never said one of them didn't belong.*

*But I heard stories. They say one miner didn't sleep like the others. He just sat against the wall and hummed some tune nobody recognized.*

*They say one miner didn't eat like the others, but they didn't complain because they had to save their provisions.*

*They say one miner - they know who but they no telling - one miner didn't talk about his family or friends or wanting to get out.*

*All this one miner talked about was how comforting the darkness felt. How they - the trapped miners - were the lucky ones.*

*That the earth only swallowed them to keep them safe.*

*While all the rest would drown in a sea of fire of their own kindling."*

This isn't about the paper anymore. Next week I'm going to drive back to see my grandfather's friend. I'm going to try and track down the unexplained miner and see what happened to him. 

---

Finding one of the miners was lot harder than I expected. Don't get me wrong, I didn't think it would be easy. I figured that most of them would still be living in Chile, and that's still a hell-of-a road trip from Texas. 

I didn't think it would be this hard to just find a phone number or ANYTHING though. After the media storm died down in 2010, it seems like nothing changed for the miners. Most of them were laid off because of that mine's closure, and those that DID find a new mining company suffered through the same intolerable working conditions.  

Even the Hollywood movie didn't help them because their story rights were considered public domain after the massive publicity. All those men got was a pathetic 7,000$ compensation for their time spent in Hell. The more I searched, the grimmer the story became. 

Over the last seven years, they have been dying one by one. A few from other mine accidents, others from health complications undoubtedly exasperated by their ordeal, but more than anything: suicides. I get it - they've had a hard life - but it was the *manner* they killed themselves that was the most unsettling. 

Self-immolation. There were a few bullets, one poison, two jumpers - but mostly I found account after account of miners dousing themselves in gasoline and burning themselves alive. It was difficult not to connect the incidents with those haunting words from the 33rd miner:

*And all the rest would drown in a sea of fire of their own kindling.*

---

It was my grandfather's friend (Vicente) who found a lead. Two of the miners who were invited to the film premiere in Los Angeles had decided to stay in America. Vicente found a recent article which followed up with the pair about the incident, although both had declined an interview. 

It was still about an 18 hour road trip, but after I shared my research with Vicente, he volunteered to make the drive with me. I convinced my grandfather that I wanted to use this research for my future graduation thesis, and he convinced my mother to let me go. 

"What are you going to ask them?" Vicente asked on the drive. One of the conditions for the trip was that I help him practice his English, and he talked non-stop the whole way.

"I'm going to ask them to help me find the 33rd miner. The one who wasn't human." 

"El Diablo," Vicente said. "And if he's one of the two you meet? What do you say to him then?" 

"I guess I'll tell him to go to Hell." I meant it as a joke, but neither of us laughed. "Or find out why he's here."

"And if you don't like what he says? You will stop him?" 

I didn't have an answer then, but I had plenty of time to think about it on the drive to LA.

---

We found one of the miner's address's by contacting the newspaper which tried to interview him. Vicente told the reporter that he and the miner were old friends - an account made credible by his first person details of the rescue operation. 

Vicente told the reporter that he could persuade the miner into accepting the interview if we only knew where he lived - and voila. I guess private information is less important than a shot at a successful article. 

Vicente and I were soon walking up the dilapidated staircase of the apartment - although even calling this dump an apartment seemed insulting to all the other residences which share a name.

The walls were covered with grime thick enough to sink a finger into. Trash, dirty diapers, and decaying leftovers littered the hallways, and on every floor we heard either couples fighting, women screaming at their kids, or loud drunken sex. I'm glad Vicente was with me when I knocked on the door. 

"Come in." 

Vicente and I exchanged a quizzical expression. If I was living in this kind of neighborhood, I wouldn't invite strangers in. Vicente shrugged and opened the door. 

It was almost surreal walking inside. Fresh white paint on the walls, spotlessly shined kitchen counter, a sterile chemical smell like a hospital - it was like stepping through the door into a different world. 
 
A middle aged man blinked his black, sunken eyes at us. His dark skin and hair looked a lot like Vicente - he could easily have been Chilean. 

He was sitting on a sofa which faced a blank white wall. There weren't any books, or TV, or anything. I can't imagine what he was doing before we came in. 

"Have a seat." The man patted the cushion beside him. 

There weren't any chairs, and sitting next to him on the sofa seemed uncomfortably familiar. I shifted my weight from leg to leg and looked to Vicente for help. 

"Sorry to just show up," Vicente said, obviously uncomfortable as well. "I hope we didn't interrupt nothing." 

The man looked back at his blank white wall. He shrugged. 

"Are you a survivor from the mine?" I blurted out. Vicente put a hand out to caution me, but I kept going. "I was writing a school paper on - well I wanted to know about - who was the 33rd miner? The one who didn't belong." 

"Didn't belong?" he asked, still addressing the white wall. "He was the only one who *did* belong down there." 

"Can you tell me about him?" He pulled a notebook out of his pocket and began writing something down. I looked at Vicente, and he smiled encouragingly. All those hours in the car and this was all I could think about. I was finally going to get some answers.

The man offered me the notebook, and I moved close to take it from him. 

*Agustin: 3006 W Burbank Blvd. Los Angeles.*

"Ask him yourself," the miner said. 

"Will you go with us?" I asked. 

The miner shook his head, still not looking at me. 

"If there's something bad going to happen, you have to tell us," Vicente added. 
 
"It's too late," the miner replied. A shudder passed over his body as though he were shivering from a cold wind blowing from the inside out. "He's the last one left, and it has already begun." 

Why was he looking still looking at the wall? I started to move around in front of the sofa to force him to look at me when -   

"Look out!" A hand landed on the back of my shirt and yanked me hard. I spun to the ground, still clutching the notebook. I tried to push Vicente off, but his old hands were like iron. It wasn't until he had dragged me almost out the door when I noticed the man on the sofa was holding a handgun. 

*BLAM*. Vicente let go of my shirt and stared with me. The miner had opened his mouth and put a bullet through his own brain. The once perfect white wall behind him looked like an open wound. Vicente grabbed me by the shirt again and dragged me from the room. 

---

I'm outside of the 33rd miner's house, but this time I'm alone.
 
After that grizzly spectacle, Vicente refused to let me keep searching. He was ready to drive straight through the night, all the way back to Texas right then and there. 

He didn't want to call the police. The reporter knew we were going, but he didn't know who we were. Vicente figured that if we just left the state now, we'd never get tangled up in this any more than we already were. 

I saw it differently though. If the last miner really was the only one of the 33 still alive, then Vicente and I might be the only two people who knew something was going on. We had a responsibility to find out more. 

It was all I could do just to convince Vicente to get a motel for the night before driving back. I used the extra time to beg and plead with him, but it was impossible to get through. "Let him burn himself alive for all I care. We never should have come here." I might as well have been begging the sun not to set in the evening. 

I waited until Vicente fell asleep before slipping down to the street to order an UBER. A dark sedan swept me down the unfamiliar streets, but I was so wrapped up in my own thoughts that I didn't even speak a word to the driver. I wish I had though - I wish I'd asked him to wait and make sure I was okay, but he's gone now. It's going to just be me and the Devil. 

This isn't a house or an apartment building though. I was standing outside a crematorium. What if the miner simply worked here now? By the time they were opened again, Vicente would be awake and we'd be driving back to Texas. I circled round the building, looking for some clues or staff directories or anything. Maybe this was an unhealthy obsession for me. Maybe I should just let it go and stay out of trouble like Vicente. 

But trouble is there whether you're looking for it or not, and it's best to know what's coming before it hits you. There was a light on in the back of the building. It took about ten minutes pacing outside in the darkness before my heart slowed to a familiar rhythm and I was ready to approach. 

I knocked on the door. No answer. I peered through the lit window - looked like an office room. I knocked on the glass. No answer. My heart was starting to race again. I was stupid for even being here. Someone had just forgotten to turn out the light when they went home. 

I went back to the door and tried the handle. It was unlocked. The grating sound of the door swinging open seemed so loud in the still night that people must have heard it a block away. 

"Hello? Anyone here?" I called out, immediately regretting it. I don't know which was worse, taking the Devil by surprise or letting him know I was coming. I still switched on every light I could find, just in case something jumped out at me. 

"Agustin?" I shouted. No answer. I found another door with light seeping under the crack and opened it.

Agustin was inside. I could tell because of the name-tag on his overalls. He was on his hands and knees, the charred remains of his head placed firmly inside one of the cremation ovens. I don't know whether he died the moment his head went inside, but I'd imagine he had to hold it there for awhile. What could he possibly have seen or known that was worse than this?

---

I called an UBER to take me back to the motel. I guess that was it. All 33 were dead. I hope whatever evil spirit crawled up from the earth with those men had spent its wrath doing whatever it did to them and was sleeping peacefully now. 

The same dark sedan stopped and I got it. 

"Hi there," I said. "Thanks for getting me again. 

The driver - or the miner, I guess they were the same - turned around and smiled. It was hard not to smile with the bottom half of your jaw hanging loose. I could clearly see the pathway where the bullet entered his mouth and tore up through his brain. It was mesmerizing to watch that mass of loose flesh contort to form the shapes necessary for speech.  

"I see you've found the man you're looking for," what's left of his face replied. 

"A man wouldn't be alive right now. What are you?" 

The loose flesh pulled tighter and a trickle of blood dribbled out onto the driver's console. He didn't kill the other miners. They killed themselves - as far as I could tell. As long as I kept my wits about me, I could make it through this. I looked down at my lap so I could pretend I was just having an ordinary conversation. Not as easy as it sounds with the blood dripping down the console around my feet. 

"I will answer one question for your persistence. Don't waste it on such trivial semantics." 

I took a deep breath. It smelled like food which has just begun to spoil. 

"How can I stop the sea of fire you mentioned when you climbed out of that mine?" 

"Only fools play with matches." 

I had to look up at that. Even if it meant staring into that grotesque face - there's no way my single question was going to be wasted with that shitty answer.

"What is that supposed to mean? Why are you even here? Are you trying to warn us not to blow ourselves up, because we know that without whatever the fuck game you're playing." 

The miner slumped forward into his seat. The blood on the back of his head was congealed - he had died quite awhile ago. I wanted to scream - to break the window - to punch HIM in his disgusting bloody face, but I was next to a dead man for the third time this night. More than anything, I wanted to get home. I just got out of the car and started walking the whole way back toward the motel.  

---

The notebook! If that miner was the real Devil - and that's the only explanation that makes sense to me - then he had given me his notebook. I stopped walking and used the light from my phone to desperately flip through the pages looking for some other clue. There on the first page were more words, written in a fluid hand.    

---

*While they sat down in the dark, waiting for tomorrow's spark, telling tales of broken hearts, I joined them in their cell.*

*Don't be afraid, I sang to each, don't hate the world beyond your reach, I hear your prayers as you beseech, me save you with my spell.*

*Only fools play with matches, or bury treasure with no latches, or sign a deal when the catch is, the soul you have to sell.* 

*But the fool has born you, raised you, sold you. The fool has torn you, dazed you, told you. He won't mourn you, praise you, hold you, when finally you yell.*
 
*Only fools play with matches, and suffer all those needless scratches, you will find your soul detaches, free at last in Hell.*

How much must one man suffer before Hell becomes an escape? I hope I [never find out](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade)

<TEXT> *Everybody dies*. That's common knowledge. I learned it when I was five when my hamster met a hawk for the first (and last) time. It was my fault for taking him outside, but that only made the discovery harder. 

*Everything dies*. Everything in the history of the world, up to about a hundred years ago, has died. We take that as proof that we're going to die too, although we don't know for certain until we're actually gone - and by then it's too late to know anything *for certain*. As long as we're still alive, it *feels* like there is a chance - no matter how improbable - that we are the exception. That somehow everyone else in the world will die while we will live forever. 

I hope some of you just thought about [Louis CK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYVnraY8ZDs)'s bit about everybody dying. That's what was playing on TV when Grandmother Elis entered the room. 

"Don't listen to that man," she said. "Not everybody dies." 

Of all the objectionable things Louis CK jokes about, I can't believe this is the topic she chose to argue. 

"Of course not, Granny. You're not going anywhere." There is no point in arguing with old people about absolutely anything. Even when they're wrong, they've grown accustomed to being wrong too long for the facts to keep up. 

"Oh I'm going to die," she said, laboriously sitting down next to me. "When you get to 84, you can't even put a roast in the oven without wondering if you'll be around to take it out. But not everybody dies. My grandfather is 143 years old."

"That's not possible." Was it? I've heard some people lived to be ancient, but I'm pretty sure no-one makes it to 143 without the Devil's private medical insurance.  

"He was born in Belgium in 1874, but he lives nearby now."

"How do you know?"

"He still sends me a birthday card every year. I have them up in the attic somewhere." 

"But how do you know he's the one sending the cards?" I pressed. "When was the last time you visited him?"

"I never visit. I have nothing to say to him." 

That's all she would say about the subject, but my curiosity wasn't nearly satisfied. 

---

I found the birthday card in a shoebox along with 83 other cards. [It looked like this.](http://thegraphicsfairy.com/wp-content/uploads/blogger/_CarNcodpCMA/SkV3UDrG5aI/AAAAAAAADvg/AEz-XyI1khY/s1600/1aswallowgfairy004.jpg). I think they were all hand-drawn and colored, but the older ones were warped and yellowed by time and water damage.  

Within each card was inscribed an address alongside this verse:

*One less year for you to wait,*
*before your sweet release.*
*Won't you shed your mortal fate,*
*and live with me in peace?*

It sounds to me like he was offering grandmother an escape from death. I can't imagine that he really had a cure, but I wouldn't turn down that offer if it was handed to me. 

---

Visiting old people is a chore. Visiting *ancient* people is an adventure. I plugged the most recent address into google maps, and it led me to a Victorian era estate house on the edge of town. It looked like nobody has lived here for years. Even if the old guy was a myth, it would be fun to just poke around and have a look. 

I climbed up the rotting porch and knocked on the door, leaving an imprint in the dust the shape of my fist. I hope he doesn't break a hip on his way to let me in. He probably has some live-in medical staff if he's lasted this long though. 

When the door swung open, a tall thin man with rigid posture and a pristine suit stood before me. He was wearing an old fashion plague mask and black leather gloves, so I couldn't see his skin. By the way he was standing though, I figured he couldn't be *that* old.

"Um, hi. Does Mr. Jacobs still live here?" 

He didn't move. One arm was held behind his back at a perfect right angle. A corpse couldn't have held more stolid composure. 

"He sent my grandmother this card. And like, 80 other cards - one every year." I produced the birthday card, and the man snatched it like a striking snake. The card disappeared into his pocket without a glance. He turned wordlessly and entered the house, leaving the door open behind him. 

---

"Sit." The figure gestured at an elaborately embroidered arm chair which the Queen of England wouldn't have looked out of place in. The whole house was absolutely magnificent - while the outside was dilapidated enough to be seen on a "we buy ugly houses" poster, the interior was immaculately preserved. Dark mahogany wood panels, crystal chandelier, intricate golden light fixtures, and shelves and alcoves stuffed to bursting with all manner of exotic dolls, carvings, and trinkets. 

"Why did Elis send you?" he asked. The voice had a peculiar hollow ring as it reverberated inside the mask. The words were slightly clipped, but his English was flawless. He continued to tower over me as stiff as a flag pole. My hands ran self-consciously over one another in my lap. 

I was tempted to admit I came on my own, but the cards seemed specifically for my grandmother and I didn't want to be turned away. Idle curiosity doesn't open nearly as many doors as blatant lies. 

"My grandmother - Elis - she wanted me to meet Mr. Jacobs for her." 

"I am Mr. Jacobs."  

"Then, um, she wanted to let me decide whether to accept your offer." I didn't know what it meant, but it was just vague enough to work. 

He bent over me, the long nose of the mask practically scratching my skin. The slow intake of breath - was he sniffing me? I fought the urge to be sick when a wave of the thick incense within the mask washed over my face. 

Apparently satisfied, the man moved to sit across from me on the other side of the marble coffee-table. He poured a glass of red wine from a silver decanter for me before pouring another for himself. His long body leaned back, crossing his lithe legs with the dexterity of a dancer. Polished leather shoes flashing softly in the dull light. There is no way this guy is a 143 years old. 

"Drink," he said, the thick perfume billowing out of the mask. 

"I'm not old enough to -" 

"How old are you, boy?" 

"19. How old are you?" 

"Are you old enough to fear death?" 

I nodded. 

"Then you are old enough to drink." 

I was getting really uncomfortable at this point. My hands wouldn't sit still. Maybe I was in over my head. I was just curious, that's all. I didn't really believe he was 143 years old. If he really *did* have a cure for death, why wouldn't my Grandmother accept it? 

"I think there's been a mistake. I think I should be going now." I started to stand, but he was faster. He stepped directly over the coffee table and blocked me from getting out of the over-stuffed chair.  The perfume was intoxicating. I couldn't think straight. Whatever I tried to focus on just blurred out in my mind. All I could see was the piercing red wine taunting me from the table. The only sounds were my beating heart and his melodic voice echoing from the mask.

"Is this a game to you, boy? Are you trying to play me?" 

"No sir, I -" 

"Do you seek to fool me? To rob me? To take my secrets and sell them for your own gain?" 

"I swear I only came because -" My head was spinning. The crystal chandelier flashed as bright as a lighthouse. The scent was overwhelming. It was all I could do just to avoid throwing up. Even if he wasn't blocking me in, I don't know if I could stand to leave. 

"Because what? Why are you here? Why have you disturbed my home?" He was shouting now - at least I think he was. My senses were so saturated with noise and light and smell. 

I shut my eyes tight. I pressed my hands over my ears so tightly I could feel them pop somewhere deep within my head. 

"I don't want to die!" I shouted. I could have said anything else, but that's the only thought my mind could hold onto. 

"Then drink." My eyes were still closed, but I could feel the glass of wine being shoved into my face - spilling over my chest. I grabbed it with both hands and gulped it down like I had been lost in the desert for years.

Mr. Jacob's presence immediately lifted. He must have moved away to the other side of the coffee table again. That all-consuming perfume began to clear from the air, but I kept drinking. I didn't want to die. I don't care what happened to me in that moment. I never wanted to die. 

*Crunch*. Something hard slipped into my mouth from the bottom of the wineglass. I opened my eyes. The bottom of the glass was crawling with beetles. I tried to cough, but the one already in my mouth slipped down my throat. I could feel its legs struggling against my esophagus all the way down. 

"Do not worry, child." Mr. Jacob's voice was soft as a purring cat. "You never will. Now go home, and do not return without your Grandmother." 

I got up and ran. Once outside, I fell to my hands and knees and *heaved* on the ground. I forced my fingers down my throat, but I didn't need much help to induce the vomiting. The red wine poured out in waves, splattering all over my hands and knees. 

Still gasping for breath, I ran my hands through my own vomit - searching. It was all liquid. I squeezed the wet dirt between my fingers. The beetle hadn't come out. 

I took off my shirt and pants (which were soaked in vomit) and put them in the back of my car. I drove home, trying my best to pretend nothing happened. 

But it was hard not to think about it when I could feel the beetle crawling around [inside me](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade).

<TITLE> The 32 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-11 05:58:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A lot of you probably know about the Chilean mining accident of 2010. It was also called the "Los 33" because of the 33 miners trapped underground. It's amazing that all 33 survived the entire 69 days it took until they were rescued.

There was a whole media circus about it with an estimated billion people watching the rescue on TV or the internet. There was so much news that one fact was completely drowned out - and to me, it's the most important of them all.

I became interested in the topic because of a school paper I was writing. I mentioned the project to my grandfather (which was a terrible mistake because he is ZEALOUS about school). He was trying to get my mother to enroll me in an international baccalaureate college prep school at FIRST GRADE. Education is my future - he wishes he had those opportunities when he was a kid - I'm an ungrateful brat for taking my fortune for blessing - you know the drill.

Anyway, he wouldn't let me use wikipedia or any easy source for the essay. Instead, he called up his old friend who actually worked on the rescue crew in Chile. So what should have been an hour long paper turned into an hour phone interview, three hours of driving, and a whole BOOK about rescue operations. Who since the internet was invented ever needed to read a book about anything?

Meeting the rescue worker guy was pretty interesting though. He had tan leather skin like you'd expect to find on a car seat instead of a person. His accent was a little thick, and sometimes he couldn't find the right word so he had to switch to Spanish. I know next to zero Spanish, but my grandfather would make me write down everything he said verbatim so I could translate it at home. Granddad literally said "If you try to take the easy road in life, life is going to take the easy road with you. Right up your ass". I don't know what that means, but asking him to clarify didn't seem necessary. 

About half-way through the interview with the rescue guy, My grandfather got up to go to the bathroom. I was asking questions about how many people were down there, and he kept saying "treinta-y-dos", or 32. The movie is even called "The 33" - everything online says "The 33", but he was adamant. Then he gave me this weird look - like he was shell-shocked or something. The kind of blank look you expect to see holocaust survivors wearing. He leaned in real close and started rattling off some stuff in English and some in Spanish, and I did my best to keep up.

It wasn't until the car ride home when I was able to translate what he said. I checked it half a dozen times - I even ran the transcript by my Grandfather (who is fluent, but still made me do my own translating first). Here is what we put together:

*"All the media - the news - the story spinners - they all say 33 miners were trapped. And why wouldn't they? 33 people came out of that mine. The miners were trapped 700 meters in the ground - there was no way in or out. But the miners who come out - right when I first pull them out - they all say the same thing.*

*There were only 32 miners trapped. They count and they count - every day - every few hours so everybody taken care of - and then one day they count again and there is 33.*

*They were a band of brothers - you can't go through an ordeal like that and not become family - and they stuck by each other. They never said one of them didn't belong.*

*But I heard stories. They say one miner didn't sleep like the others. He just sat against the wall and hummed some tune nobody recognized.*

*They say one miner didn't eat like the others, but they didn't complain because they had to save their provisions.*

*They say one miner - they know who but they no telling - one miner didn't talk about his family or friends or wanting to get out.*

*All this one miner talked about was how comforting the darkness felt. How they - the trapped miners - were the lucky ones.*

*That the earth only swallowed them to keep them safe.*

*While all the rest would drown in a sea of fire of their own kindling."*

This isn't about the paper anymore. Next week I'm going to drive back to see my grandfather's friend. I'm going to try and track down the unexplained miner and see what happened to him. 

---

Finding one of the miners was lot harder than I expected. Don't get me wrong, I didn't think it would be easy. I figured that most of them would still be living in Chile, and that's still a hell-of-a road trip from Texas. 

I didn't think it would be this hard to just find a phone number or ANYTHING though. After the media storm died down in 2010, it seems like nothing changed for the miners. Most of them were laid off because of that mine's closure, and those that DID find a new mining company suffered through the same intolerable working conditions.  

Even the Hollywood movie didn't help them because their story rights were considered public domain after the massive publicity. All those men got was a pathetic 7,000$ compensation for their time spent in Hell. The more I searched, the grimmer the story became. 

Over the last seven years, they have been dying one by one. A few from other mine accidents, others from health complications undoubtedly exasperated by their ordeal, but more than anything: suicides. I get it - they've had a hard life - but it was the *manner* they killed themselves that was the most unsettling. 

Self-immolation. There were a few bullets, one poison, two jumpers - but mostly I found account after account of miners dousing themselves in gasoline and burning themselves alive. It was difficult not to connect the incidents with those haunting words from the 33rd miner:

*And all the rest would drown in a sea of fire of their own kindling.*

---

It was my grandfather's friend (Vicente) who found a lead. Two of the miners who were invited to the film premiere in Los Angeles had decided to stay in America. Vicente found a recent article which followed up with the pair about the incident, although both had declined an interview. 

It was still about an 18 hour road trip, but after I shared my research with Vicente, he volunteered to make the drive with me. I convinced my grandfather that I wanted to use this research for my future graduation thesis, and he convinced my mother to let me go. 

"What are you going to ask them?" Vicente asked on the drive. One of the conditions for the trip was that I help him practice his English, and he talked non-stop the whole way.

"I'm going to ask them to help me find the 33rd miner. The one who wasn't human." 

"El Diablo," Vicente said. "And if he's one of the two you meet? What do you say to him then?" 

"I guess I'll tell him to go to Hell." I meant it as a joke, but neither of us laughed. "Or find out why he's here."

"And if you don't like what he says? You will stop him?" 

I didn't have an answer then, but I had plenty of time to think about it on the drive to LA.

---

We found one of the miner's address's by contacting the newspaper which tried to interview him. Vicente told the reporter that he and the miner were old friends - an account made credible by his first person details of the rescue operation. 

Vicente told the reporter that he could persuade the miner into accepting the interview if we only knew where he lived - and voila. I guess private information is less important than a shot at a successful article. 

Vicente and I were soon walking up the dilapidated staircase of the apartment - although even calling this dump an apartment seemed insulting to all the other residences which share a name.

The walls were covered with grime thick enough to sink a finger into. Trash, dirty diapers, and decaying leftovers littered the hallways, and on every floor we heard either couples fighting, women screaming at their kids, or loud drunken sex. I'm glad Vicente was with me when I knocked on the door. 

"Come in." 

Vicente and I exchanged a quizzical expression. If I was living in this kind of neighborhood, I wouldn't invite strangers in. Vicente shrugged and opened the door. 

It was almost surreal walking inside. Fresh white paint on the walls, spotlessly shined kitchen counter, a sterile chemical smell like a hospital - it was like stepping through the door into a different world. 
 
A middle aged man blinked his black, sunken eyes at us. His dark skin and hair looked a lot like Vicente - he could easily have been Chilean. 

He was sitting on a sofa which faced a blank white wall. There weren't any books, or TV, or anything. I can't imagine what he was doing before we came in. 

"Have a seat." The man patted the cushion beside him. 

There weren't any chairs, and sitting next to him on the sofa seemed uncomfortably familiar. I shifted my weight from leg to leg and looked to Vicente for help. 

"Sorry to just show up," Vicente said, obviously uncomfortable as well. "I hope we didn't interrupt nothing." 

The man looked back at his blank white wall. He shrugged. 

"Are you a survivor from the mine?" I blurted out. Vicente put a hand out to caution me, but I kept going. "I was writing a school paper on - well I wanted to know about - who was the 33rd miner? The one who didn't belong." 

"Didn't belong?" he asked, still addressing the white wall. "He was the only one who *did* belong down there." 

"Can you tell me about him?" He pulled a notebook out of his pocket and began writing something down. I looked at Vicente, and he smiled encouragingly. All those hours in the car and this was all I could think about. I was finally going to get some answers.

The man offered me the notebook, and I moved close to take it from him. 

*Agustin: 3006 W Burbank Blvd. Los Angeles.*

"Ask him yourself," the miner said. 

"Will you go with us?" I asked. 

The miner shook his head, still not looking at me. 

"If there's something bad going to happen, you have to tell us," Vicente added. 
 
"It's too late," the miner replied. A shudder passed over his body as though he were shivering from a cold wind blowing from the inside out. "He's the last one left, and it has already begun." 

Why was he looking still looking at the wall? I started to move around in front of the sofa to force him to look at me when -   

"Look out!" A hand landed on the back of my shirt and yanked me hard. I spun to the ground, still clutching the notebook. I tried to push Vicente off, but his old hands were like iron. It wasn't until he had dragged me almost out the door when I noticed the man on the sofa was holding a handgun. 

*BLAM*. Vicente let go of my shirt and stared with me. The miner had opened his mouth and put a bullet through his own brain. The once perfect white wall behind him looked like an open wound. Vicente grabbed me by the shirt again and dragged me from the room. 

---

I'm outside of the 33rd miner's house, but this time I'm alone.
 
After that grizzly spectacle, Vicente refused to let me keep searching. He was ready to drive straight through the night, all the way back to Texas right then and there. 

He didn't want to call the police. The reporter knew we were going, but he didn't know who we were. Vicente figured that if we just left the state now, we'd never get tangled up in this any more than we already were. 

I saw it differently though. If the last miner really was the only one of the 33 still alive, then Vicente and I might be the only two people who knew something was going on. We had a responsibility to find out more. 

It was all I could do just to convince Vicente to get a motel for the night before driving back. I used the extra time to beg and plead with him, but it was impossible to get through. "Let him burn himself alive for all I care. We never should have come here." I might as well have been begging the sun not to set in the evening. 

I waited until Vicente fell asleep before slipping down to the street to order an UBER. A dark sedan swept me down the unfamiliar streets, but I was so wrapped up in my own thoughts that I didn't even speak a word to the driver. I wish I had though - I wish I'd asked him to wait and make sure I was okay, but he's gone now. It's going to just be me and the Devil. 

This isn't a house or an apartment building though. I was standing outside a crematorium. What if the miner simply worked here now? By the time they were opened again, Vicente would be awake and we'd be driving back to Texas. I circled round the building, looking for some clues or staff directories or anything. Maybe this was an unhealthy obsession for me. Maybe I should just let it go and stay out of trouble like Vicente. 

But trouble is there whether you're looking for it or not, and it's best to know what's coming before it hits you. There was a light on in the back of the building. It took about ten minutes pacing outside in the darkness before my heart slowed to a familiar rhythm and I was ready to approach. 

I knocked on the door. No answer. I peered through the lit window - looked like an office room. I knocked on the glass. No answer. My heart was starting to race again. I was stupid for even being here. Someone had just forgotten to turn out the light when they went home. 

I went back to the door and tried the handle. It was unlocked. The grating sound of the door swinging open seemed so loud in the still night that people must have heard it a block away. 

"Hello? Anyone here?" I called out, immediately regretting it. I don't know which was worse, taking the Devil by surprise or letting him know I was coming. I still switched on every light I could find, just in case something jumped out at me. 

"Agustin?" I shouted. No answer. I found another door with light seeping under the crack and opened it.

Agustin was inside. I could tell because of the name-tag on his overalls. He was on his hands and knees, the charred remains of his head placed firmly inside one of the cremation ovens. I don't know whether he died the moment his head went inside, but I'd imagine he had to hold it there for awhile. What could he possibly have seen or known that was worse than this?

---

I called an UBER to take me back to the motel. I guess that was it. All 33 were dead. I hope whatever evil spirit crawled up from the earth with those men had spent its wrath doing whatever it did to them and was sleeping peacefully now. 

The same dark sedan stopped and I got it. 

"Hi there," I said. "Thanks for getting me again. 

The driver - or the miner, I guess they were the same - turned around and smiled. It was hard not to smile with the bottom half of your jaw hanging loose. I could clearly see the pathway where the bullet entered his mouth and tore up through his brain. It was mesmerizing to watch that mass of loose flesh contort to form the shapes necessary for speech.  

"I see you've found the man you're looking for," what's left of his face replied. 

"A man wouldn't be alive right now. What are you?" 

The loose flesh pulled tighter and a trickle of blood dribbled out onto the driver's console. He didn't kill the other miners. They killed themselves - as far as I could tell. As long as I kept my wits about me, I could make it through this. I looked down at my lap so I could pretend I was just having an ordinary conversation. Not as easy as it sounds with the blood dripping down the console around my feet. 

"I will answer one question for your persistence. Don't waste it on such trivial semantics." 

I took a deep breath. It smelled like food which has just begun to spoil. 

"How can I stop the sea of fire you mentioned when you climbed out of that mine?" 

"Only fools play with matches." 

I had to look up at that. Even if it meant staring into that grotesque face - there's no way my single question was going to be wasted with that shitty answer.

"What is that supposed to mean? Why are you even here? Are you trying to warn us not to blow ourselves up, because we know that without whatever the fuck game you're playing." 

The miner slumped forward into his seat. The blood on the back of his head was congealed - he had died quite awhile ago. I wanted to scream - to break the window - to punch HIM in his disgusting bloody face, but I was next to a dead man for the third time this night. More than anything, I wanted to get home. I just got out of the car and started walking the whole way back toward the motel.  

---

The notebook! If that miner was the real Devil - and that's the only explanation that makes sense to me - then he had given me his notebook. I stopped walking and used the light from my phone to desperately flip through the pages looking for some other clue. There on the first page were more words, written in a fluid hand.    

---

*While they sat down in the dark, waiting for tomorrow's spark, telling tales of broken hearts, I joined them in their cell.*

*Don't be afraid, I sang to each, don't hate the world beyond your reach, I hear your prayers as you beseech, me save you with my spell.*

*Only fools play with matches, or bury treasure with no latches, or sign a deal when the catch is, the soul you have to sell.* 

*But the fool has born you, raised you, sold you. The fool has torn you, dazed you, told you. He won't mourn you, praise you, hold you, when finally you yell.*
 
*Only fools play with matches, and suffer all those needless scratches, you will find your soul detaches, free at last in Hell.*

<TITLE> In defense of FEAR </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-10 19:18:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey all. I used to be a young adult novelist, but I've recently transitioned to writing horror. A lot of people in my life seemed disturbed by this fact (especially my parents who are convinced I'm secretly depressed because of it). Here's the response I gave them, and hopefully it will help some of you explaining your passion as well. 

IN DEFENSE OF FEAR
-

Why horror? Isn't there already enough fear in the world?

Yes, there is, and that's exactly why horror entertainment is so important. 

Some people will try focus on "positive emotions" such as love and joy while repressing their fear, anger, jealousy, and other "negative" emotions.

I think this is an extremely dangerous thing to do, because pretending they don't exist doesn't make the other emotions go away. It only inhibits our ability to understand and control them - and when we aren't controlling them, they're controlling us. 

Without control, we are easy victims for any politician to use our fears to manipulate our vote.
We are helpless to the holy man who uses our fear of the afterlife to control our values. 
We are even inept to confess to the girl we love, or follow our dreams, or anything where fear stands as a boundary between us and our goal. 

There are no such thing as a "positive" or "negative" emotion. Everything we feel contributes to making us human, and all emotions have an equal capacity to improve or destroy our lives and the lives of those around us. 

How many times has love been our justification for obsession and greed?
Hasn't the pursuit of joy caused some of us to waste our lives with selfish hedonism?
Even empathy for your neighbor has been used as grounds to start wars or ostracize entire races and cultures who seem different from you.  

So do not judge fear as evil just because it can be used for evil means. It is silly to blame a knife for a murder that its wielder committed.  

By appreciating the beauty of fear - fear as an art-form - by accepting it is part of the human experience instead of trying to run from it, we're able to better equip ourselves to handle the fear in our daily lives. 

That's why I've decided to write horror. My goal is to dig down to all the nameless terrors rooted in your subconscious and rock you to the bottom of your psychology. I'm going to let all the monsters out from under your bed until you finally get a good look at them and realize that fear can't hold you back anymore.

It can even be fun.

<TITLE> The making of a psychopath </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-07 22:44:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> *There's a psychopath in my house.*

No he didn't break in. He sleeps in the same room as me. It's not my brother's fault; this is just who he is. 

If it's anyone's fault, it's my parents. My mom left when I was six and my little brother was four. She never wanted us, or at least that's what my dad said because I don't remember her very well. 

Dad said she used to be a perfect student with big dreams, then she got knocked up and had to drop out of college to take care of us. He reminds us all the time that it was our fault she left, and how happy he was before we were born.

That's the nice version of what he said anyway. Lots of stuff about her being an ungrateful slut who will burn in Hell, but I don't think of her that way. If I was married to someone like my dad, I would have run away too. 

My dad needed "medicine" to cope with her leaving. Every time he took it, he would be gone for a few days. It would be just me and my little brother in the house, and I took care of him the best I could. My dad wouldn't usually leave us with any money, but I got pretty good at hiding things under my dress at the grocery store. 

I thought things would change when I was 12 and found a paper bag with about 1,000 dollars in our backyard. I thought mom had sent it - that she'd heard about how hard things were and mailed us some money. 

I could usually find food when I needed it badly enough, so I didn't want to waste it on things like that. It was my brother's 10th birthday coming up and that seemed like a big deal. I hired a van and brought him and seven kids from his class to spend the whole day at Sea World. 

It was so much fun I thought about never going back. My brother didn't want to run away though, and I couldn't leave him. Besides, the van driver was keeping an eye on us and said he had to bring us home or he might get fired. 

We should have run away though. The money hadn't come from my mom - she'd forgotten about us. That's when I found out my dad's "medicine" was meth, and that he'd been selling some to his friends when he dropped the money by mistake. I tried to tell him that it was my fault, but since it got spent on my brother's birthday, he got the worst of it. 

My brother didn't walk again for two years after that. He needed even more help now that he was in a wheelchair. There were more bills that weren't being paid - the electricity, the gas, even the rent sometimes. I had to be out a lot trying to find money, sometimes for days at a time when I was staking out a house to steal from. 

I couldn't leave my brother alone too long though. My dad would just ignore him, and if I didn't check in at least twice a day then I'd find my brother sitting in his own piss and shit. I think he could have made it to the toilet by himself if he really tried, but he just gave up caring about everything.

There is one thing my brother started doing to pass the time though, although this I wish he hadn't. I noticed his growing collection of small animal skulls for awhile, but I assumed they were just plastic until I saw how he was catching them.

I watched him put bird seed in a 2L soda bottle with the opening cut wider. Once a squirrel crawled in, he would pull a string which slid the bottle down to cover the opening with a piece of cardboard. It would struggle frantically to get out, but when it was near the opening its own weight would hold the bottle into place against the board. 

I would have congratulated him on his contraption except for what happened next. He picked up the bottle - cardboard still covering the opening - and slipped a couple razor blades into the opening. Then he *SHOOK* the whole thing until it looked like the inside of a blender, the squirrel *SCREAMING* the whole time. 

I took it away from him, but he just kept building little things like that. It wasn't just squirrels either - mice, small birds, even a raccoon once. After he'd killed them, he'd *BITE* the head straight off and then spit it into a bowl of water to clean the organic matter off the skull.

*"Please stop. God didn't make those animals just so you could torture them,"* I said to him. 

*"Then why did he make it so much fun?"*

---

It's not just animals anymore. I found a big cardboard box out on the sidewalk near the bus-stop. Inside was a bag of M Ms, a couple comic books, and his old Gameboy Color. There was a rope tied to little hooks inside the box which led toward my house.

If someone were to pull that rope, the box would close and the whole thing would be dragged down the sidewalk. I don't think he'd be strong enough to pull anyone bigger than a six year old, but the school bus stopped here. 

I ripped the box into pieces and ran to confront him. I found him sitting on his bed - he was out of the wheelchair now - waiting with a knife in his hands. 

*What the hell are you trying to do?"*

*"Set a trap.*"

*"It's not going to work,"* I said. 

*"Don't worry. It'll work.*"

*"I destroyed it. Why are you trying to trap some kid?"*

*"I'm not. I'm trying to trap you."*

That's when I noticed that the TV was suspended with ropes above me. He cut the cord, and it landed right on top of my head. 

He must have counted on that knocking me out because he was already coming at me with the knife. I was dizzy, but I managed to scramble out of the way and slam the door in his face. 

---

After that, I was too scared to go back inside the house. I called Child Protective Services and reported the meth deals my dad was doing in the home. I didn't mention what my brother has been doing because I thought once he was out of here he'd have a chance at a fresh start. I didn't want his life to be over before it had even begun.

We were both put into separate foster homes, and it's been two years since I've heard anything from him. That was until last night.

---

My adoptive parents - wonderful Asian couple who couldn't have kids of their own - sat down with me at the kitchen table. They told me they had some good news: they were going to adopt my brother as well. 

I guess the family that took him in suffered an unfortunate accident. They didn't tell me what happened, but by the look they gave each other, it was something gruesome. 

I hope he's changed. Telling people what he did will stop him from being adopted and ruin his life forever. I can't say anything until I've seen him again. If he hasn't though...

Well that's why I'm writing this. If he hasn't changed, then at least someone will know what happened and have a shot at stopping it from [happening again](http://tobiaswade.com/horror-blog). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've done it. Three years of being single, and I've finally gotten a girlfriend. 

*Yes she's human. No she's not blind. No she's not a body pillow.*

These are the kinds of questions my best friend Mike kept asking me. I was so excited that it didn't even bother me. Besides, I knew he was just jealous because he'd never even been with a girl before. He's always been the bigger nerd between the two of us - like like learning Elvish from Tolkien's books and chanting spells in our DnD games - hardcore nerd stuff. 

Neither of us are the type of guy that girls tend to hang around though. Mike and I live together; we're both video game streamers (Hearthstone and Dota2), and we make a living off advertising and tournament winnings. 

I met Natasha through a Twitch chat room and she happened to live close by. Since the first day we met, we've practically been joined at the hip. We eat every meal together, shower together, even stream together. 

I don't remember ever being this happy - the only problem is, Mike has decided to make this all about him. He started gaining *even more* weight, he never goes outside, and all he does is bitch about how I never hang out with him anymore. 

Natasha decided the solution was for the three of us to go camping together in Yellowstone National Park. Mike would get some exercise, I'd get to hang out with him, and most importantly, Natasha and I wouldn't have to spend any time apart. 

---

I regret *everything*. Why does everything in nature have to be so damn itchy?

It turns out Natasha has a severe misunderstanding about how trails work. She must be a skyrim player, because she thinks there is only one right way up a mountain, and that's straight up the rock cliffs. 

If we weren't still at that phase of dating where everything becomes an opportunity to impress her, I would have given up and gone home. I have no idea how Mike made it, but we all decided the day was over by about 4 PM in the afternoon. 

The view was incredible - no I'm not just talking about Natasha in her short-shorts. She found a practically inaccessible rock ledge overlooking most of the park and single-handedly hauled all our camping gear up there while Mike and I lay panting on the ground. 

Campfire - s'mores - a full blanket of stars - it was a great night. Natasha and Mike bonded over Magic the Gathering cards (which I can't believe he packed instead of a lantern), and he finally agreed to start working out and taking better care of himself so he could find a girl too. 

As the campfire burned down into embers, we started telling ghost stories. I told one about a man-eating wendigo, Natasha knew a twisted story about a priest who crucified people, and Mike...

I don't know where Mike stole his story from, but he claimed to have made it up on the spot. I think he was trying to impress Natasha too, but I didn't get jealous. He said it in a sing-song rhyming voice which was super creepy, and I made him write it down afterward. It went like this: 

---

*I had a dream one fateful night
when day had made its run.
When waking world had fled from sight
and silent moon eclipses sun.*

*Into fitful slumber slipped,
losing command of my thoughts.
Nightmares around me gripped,
The familiar had come to naught.*

*I forgot what I've been taught
about what cannot cause me harm.
My fears abound, in safety sought,
I scream to waken in alarm.*

*Only to find I've fallen deeper,
down this darkened pit of shade.
No sound escapes from silent sleeper,
nor outward sign of my dismay.*

*I saw a monster rear its head,
somewhere inside of mine.
On my dear memories it fed,
the beast who devours time.*

*Scything talons raking down,
gaping jaws of a giant spider.
I was marked as I was found
As the one outsider.*

*Until all I could recall of life,
was that I had once loved.
Until that too was torn in strife,
an arm severed from the glove.*

*There upon the edge of breaking,
inside of me a guide would lead.
She was the love I'd be forsaking,
when I opened my eyes from sleep.*

*She took my hand and together ran
from the monster in my mind.
We got so far that soon began
What I never thought to find.*

*We lived a day, a season, then year,
an entire lifetime in my head.
Happy as he who has forgotten fear
of the monster I had dread.*

*Until finally it rose from quiet,
when we thought ourselves alone.
We had lived lives in spite it,
but our life together was on loan.*

*The monster had us caught!
Trapped and helpless in a corner.
With no escape I stood and fought,
rather die than be a mourner.*

*Rather lose oneself completely,
than forget what I had sworn.
Death before me, but I would beat he
who would dare to touch her form.*

*I ripped the air with my two hands,
but as the creature was not real,
no blows upon the beast did land,
though its talons I could feel.*

*Blooded broken and abused,
I awaited morning's light to heal,
and save me from this awful ruse,
that my fortune had me sealed.*

*She knelt above me, my lovely queen,
and besought me waken from this dream.
But what fate would befall her here?
would with the morning she disappear?*

*She bore the monster and its fury
begging only that I woke.
Bidding me go, though not to hurry
lest this the last time that we spoke.*

*Sweat soaked, body shakes -
I cant remember why I was sad.
Throat chocked, fully awake - 
Memories flood of the dream I had.*

*Blood trickled down my length,
and I thanked each crimson bead.
They gave hope and lent me strength.
That perhaps she too was freed.*

*And there my bride lay beside me
from my dream she was released.
Wearied from dreaming was she
who in the waking world found peace.*

---

I woke up to a high-pitched scream in the middle of the night. What the shit? 

Did a bear get into our camp? I thought we'd be safe from any of the larger wildlife because of the rock ledge. Or a maybe it was a mountain lion... 

I was on my feet - Natasha was already unzipping our tent. 

"Wait - it could be dangerous!" 

"Then we've got to help Mike." 

I couldn't fault her reasoning. I just wish she had been a little more selfish. I grabbed my cellphone to use as a flashlight and followed her outside. 

"I'm okay! I'm okay. Sorry I screamed." Mike was in his boxers, standing outside his tent. 

"You scream like a girl. What happened?" I asked. 

He pointed inside his tent and drew the flap back. Natasha and I peered inside with him. 

There was a girl - or maybe a Goddess - mid-twenties, long auburn hair, flawless skin - butt naked, lying beside Mike's empty sleeping bag. I turned away for a moment, but looked again as soon as I noticed Natasha wasn't averting her eyes. 

"Who the hell are you?" Natasha asked.

The girl smiled, making no effort to cover herself. She sat upright and began smoothing out her hair. 

"I had the dream - the same dream from that story I found." 

"Aha! I knew you didn't make that shit up," I said. 

"Yeah whatever," Mike replied. "But I was dreaming about her. And the beast was there... and..."

"What's your name? Where did you come from?" Natasha asked. 

The girl stretched luxuriously, still smiling. She stood up and wrapped her arms around Mike, peering at us from over his shoulder. 

"Where did you find that story?" I asked Mike. He was frozen stiff with a mix of terror and rapture. 

"Some book. Doesn't matter." 

"It *does* matter if it's real," I said.  

"I don't like it," Natasha said. "Either tell us who you are or get out of here." 

"No!" Mike stepped protectively in front of her. "She's lost without any food or clothes or anything. We can't just leave her in the wilderness." 

"You're just saying that because you think you're going to get some." I don't know why I was fighting it. I shouldn't be jealous. I had Natasha. But this... this just wasn't fair. 

"I don't care," Mike said. "I'm going to take her back with us and bring her to a hospital in the morning. Maybe she had a concussion or something." 

"And until the morning?" Natasha asked, crossing her arms. 

The girl pulled away from Mike and settled into his sleeping bag. Mike smiled sheepishly. 

"Well she seems comfortable here so..." 

"You're an idiot." Natasha rolled her eyes and walked out. Over her shoulder, she added "But if the girl is real, then I wouldn't be surprised if the beast was too." 

Mike gave me a thumbs up. I laughed, closing the tent behind me.  

---

That was the last time I saw Mike alive. When we checked on him in the morning, his rib-cage was flayed open. His heart was missing, but there was still some scraps of sinew and part of his aorta lying in a pool of blood beside the bag. The girl was gone.

I threw up in the bushes. Natasha just stared at the grizzly scene. 

"We're going home." She said, turning sharply away. 

"I'll start packing -"

"No," she said. "Let's just go."

"We can't leave Mike like this."

"It's his own damn fault. Now the girl could be anywhere, so let's go *now*!" 

Natasha was already half-way down the rocky wall, but I wasn't going to run through the forest naked. I opened my tent to grab some pants but - 

The girl was sitting in my tent. Her naked body was covered in blood, and when she smiled, more blood squirted out from between her teeth. 

"Hurry up!" Natasha yelled from outside. "I swear to God I'll leave without you." 

I was bout to turn and run when the bloody girl finally spoke. 

"Help me." 

"Help you? After what you did to -"

"It wasn't me!" Her smile was gone now, and she looked on the verge of tears. "It was the beast. He's free too." 

If she was telling the truth, then I couldn't just leave her here. If she wasn't... 

There was another SCREAM outside. Natasha! I leaped from the tent and ran to the place she was climbing down. Her crumbled body was lying on the ground. She must have slipped while climbing -

*No.* There was a dark shape on top of her - like a wolf with impossibly long limbs and an elongated mouth. 

"Natasha!" 

But I was helpless to get to her in time. One bite was enough to snap the rib-cage open. I couldn't watch what was going to happen next. 

I turned around, and the girl was gone. I ran - farther and faster than I ever have in my life. There were a few times when I heard something bounding through the underbrush to my side, but I didn't look. I kept running, even when my lungs felt like they were about to explode and the stitch in my side threatened to tear me in half. 

--- 

I don't know whether the girl and the beast were the same, simply two-halves of the same nightmare. I don't know if it's still out there, or whether it only comes when that story is read aloud.  

I'm going to try and find the book where Mike found the story and destroy it. Although I have to admit, I'm a little curious what else is [written in those pages..](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade)  </TEXT>

<TITLE> How to start your own cult </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-05 20:31:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Let me preface this by stating I am a firm atheist. There is no life after death, although I will go to great lengths extolling its beauty to my subjects. We do not grow older because the Reaper is always siphoning our life energy. I was not born from a dying star, and I am no prophet of the Divine Cosmic Order. 

I am a nihilist - I do not believe in anything. And as much as I do not believe in the supernatural, I believe even less in mankind and their ability to govern their own lives. 

Do you really need proof of that? Fanatic mobs begging for their religious oppression to be protected by the government, junkies in the street surrendering their will to anything they can boil into their veins, a narcissistic idiot elected president of the United States - you get the idea.  

The church-states, the cartels, the two-faced cooperations - none of them will hesitate to manipulate the population for their own selfish purposes. The vast majority of people will always be susceptible to being manipulated, because it is so much safer and easier to be told what to think than to think for yourself. 

My reasoning dictates:

1) **People will always be susceptible to manipulation.** If you aren't manipulating them, then someone else will. 

2) **The manipulator will always profit at the expense of the people.** That is the purpose for their influence. 

3) **The only way to protect people from a selfish manipulator is to become a benevolent manipulator yourself.** 

For these reasons, in my senior year of college, I decided to start my own cult. 

---

Step One: Identify your targets. 
-
People will not run to you unless they are already running away from something else. Now, where could I find the most fearful students?

I formed three support clubs and put up fliers around campus. One for the socially anxious, one for those needing financial assistance, and a third for victims of sexual assault.

Step Two: Amplify their fear
-
Ever wonder why priests scream about Hell while politicians rant about terrorists and economic collapse? There is nothing like fear to get someone's attention and follow you for relief. 

To the socially anxious, I forced them to give speeches. I asked them embarrassing questions, put them in awkward situations, and generally ridiculed them, all in the guise of helping them gain confidence. 

To the financially stressed I gave lectures about how student loans haunt people for the rest of their life. I told them how the job market is over-saturated with college degrees and how  slim their chance of employment was. I told horror stories about homeless drug addicts who graduated college but couldn't make anything of their lives. 

The sexual assault group was the most fun for me. No I didn't rape them - I needed them all to trust me. I did however convince them that I was the only one looking out for them - that there was a rapist in every party and down every dark alley. 

Step Three: Offer a Solution 
-
Three months into the semester, I had finished establishing sufficient trust. That's when I let them in on a little secret - *the reason why I'm not afraid*. 

Wouldn't it be great if there was safe place to go where no one would make you feel bad about being socially inept? A band of brothers who helped each other find jobs, share rooms, and reach financial success? Sisters who would hold your hand and keep you safe from all the predatory monsters in the world?

I had enough people now that I was able to register my flock as a co-ed professional fraternity. I did some fundraising with the groups and managed to raise enough money to renovate an abandoned motel into my headquarters. Now that I had them all together, the fun could really begin.

Step Four: Make yourself special. 
-
It's not enough for your people to need your insight. They need to *need* you. Now it was time to explain what made me unique. 

Don't force it down their throats. People don't want to be part of an organization that needs them. They want to be part of something exclusive, something that recognizes how special they know they are inside.

I began by offering private counseling sessions to everyone having difficulty. To each of them, I confessed the *truth* about why I was helping them. 

You see, I wasn't human at all. I was an alien who was born in the Andromeda galaxy. My people are empaths, allowing us to sense the suffering of other sentient beings. I felt how troubled Earth was, and I came here to save humanity from themselves. 

They were all skeptical at first, but here's what really convinced them. I told each person in confidence that the rest of the fraternity was already indoctrinated. No-one wants to be the only one left out, especially when they finally found a home which unequivocally accepts and shelters them. 

Step Five: Make them special
-
Each new member makes it that much easier to add the next because it adds credibility and makes people more afraid of being left out. Adding the first few is the hardest part, so here is what I did. 

The first person I convinced was a scared freshman girl who was raped during a house party. She was ready to give anything just to feel safe. I gave her the chance to witness the ceremony and didn't force her to commit to anything. 

I laid rows of candles in the basement and lined the walls with mannequins. I concealed the mannequins with thick robes, so it would appear as though most of the fraternity was already present. I used a surround sound system and a layered chanting soundtrack to make it seem like everyone was participating. 

By the time I was through with the ceremony, she was so afraid of being left out that she swore the oath of loyalty right on the spot. 

Step Six: Make it impossible to leave
- 
This is the final - and I would argue most important - step. There is nothing as toxic to an organization as having a previous member leave and talk about it. 

Once I had ten members who had undergone the ceremony, I organized them into two groups of five. I gave them innocent tasks to prove their loyalty. Each one would be slightly more difficult than the last, which is important for keeping them invested. 

The final task to allow them full membership and protection was very simple. Four of them must team up and kill the fifth member of the group. For each group, I chose the least loyal, most suspicious member to be killed. I told the rest that the fifth member was a traitor - that he raped one of the other members. That he was going to single handedly destroy all we had worked to build together. 

They would never do it alone, but when the rest of their group was going along with it, they lost the power to think for themselves. Both groups did as they were told. 

It was a ritualistic sacrifice - the extra man would be tied down to a stone table. I had already drugged him, minimizing his resistance. I used his slurred speech as proof that he was possessed by an evil Cosmic Spirit which sought to destroy us all.

I made sure each of the four loyal group members thrust the knife into his body at least once. After that, their conscience would bind them to me forever. 

If they stayed, their minds told them they were a hero. If they left, they were a murderer. Which do you think they would rather be?

---

One full semester later, I have indoctrinated 54 members so far. There have been 10 deaths, soon to be an 11th. 

I'm not writing this as a confession - I don't expect you'll be able to find me. I'm writing this as an offer.

My cult is growing, and there are different chapters springing up all around the country. We have been helpless pawns for too long, but we are learning how to play the game by their rules. When you are ready to take power into your own hands, I hope you will join me and [change the world](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade). </TEXT>

<TITLE> Dead Man Floating (Part 2) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-03 23:42:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Read part 1](https://redd.it/62njyr) to see how I found the dead bodies floating to the surface. 

---

After reading all of your warnings, I'll admit I was pretty hesitant about making my second dive. Just to be safe, I decided not to go on this one alone. 

Two nights ago I reconnected with Entoine, one of the boys who found some of the original floaters with me. He still remembered trying to lick the body to get his 5$ back and we laughed about it - I guess that sort of thing only happens once in your life. 

I showed him the audio recordings I pulled from the black box and talked him into joining me. He didn't have dive equipment, but I knew I'd feel better with him in the boat. 

"Notice feeling anything strange since you licked it?" I asked him while we were rowing out to the middle of the lake. 

"What kind of strange? You mean besides puking my guts out?" 

"Warts. New birth mark in the shape of a pentagram. Sudden urge to kill people. You know - something like that." 

"Not that I can think of," he admitted. "Except for my ability to talk to animals."

"What? Seriously?" 

"Yeah. He smirked. "They just don't talk back. Keep pulling your weight or the boat is going to start turning in circles." 

--- 

Reading too many horror stories online must have made me paranoid. I don't know what I was so afraid of in the first place. The visibility was good underwater, and I didn't even see any fish besides a host of little black water slugs scootering around. 

Instead of weights, this time I just used a crowbar to sink me down to the plane. The doors were so rusted they were starting to unfasten on their own, so it was no problem breaking the lock off. 

I was tense, but I remembered to force myself to keep breathing evenly through the regulator. Holding my breath under water could easily result in an arterial gas embolism. Then I'd be the next floater they found washed up on the beach.  

Even without the lock, the room was still pressure sealed with an air pocket inside. I tried leveraging the crowbar, but I still couldn't pry the door open against the weight of all that water. I managed to hammer on the door with the metal bar until a leak appeared. The wider I forced the hole, the more water flowed through to equalize the pressure. Once it was full, it should swing open without a problem.

I finally worked the crowbar all the way through the door, but this time it got stuck. That's weird, because the water was flowing freely around it so there should be plenty of space to pull it back. It was almost as if something were holding it from the other side...

That was a thought I could have done without. I freaked and dropped the crowbar, but without its weight I began to immediately float back towards the surface. I held onto the door-frame to keep myself from slipping upwards, but it was almost impossible to swim further down against my buoyancy. 

Luckily I didnt have to. The cell finished flooding and the door began opening on its own. Suddenly I was face to face with a dead body. Its skin had long since begun to rot away, especially around its eyes and mouth where there were just gaping holes remaining. 

My crowbar had stuck straight into its side where it had gotten stuck. I was about to pull myself down toward it along the door frame when I noticed the crowbar was sliding back out. 

*No. Not sliding. The body's hands were wrapped around the bar. They were pulling the crowbar out of its side.*

Had I jolted upward too quickly when I let go of the bar? Maybe I already suffered a stroke from the gas embolism without noticing? 

The body lurched toward me. *Slow, even breaths. Don't stop breathing.* Easier said than done with a dead body clambering up toward you. It was fast too - driven with a purpose. Legs and arms with openly rotten sinews moved effortlessly through the water like a practiced swimmer. 

I pushed my way out of the plane, but the body was right behind me. It dropped the crowbar and began ascending smoothly through the water toward me. It was just as fast - at least as fast - as me even though I had fins. 

*Shit.* I kicked hard, and without any weight I was raising way too swiftly. I couldn't stop myself. I felt the air expanding in my lungs so rapidly it felt like they would burst. I was practically screaming underwater, trying to get as much air out as I could. 

Once I hit the surface, the scream finally became audible, although it was little more than a wheezing gasp at that point. The boat? Where was the boat?

"Entoine get your ass over here!" He was leaning over the boat and peering down into the water - about fifty yards away. Fuck. I looked down and saw the shadow of the body swiftly ascending toward me. 

I swam hard toward the boat. Entoine wasn't reacting. There's no way he didn't hear me. Why the hell didn't he start rowing? He was just staring into the depth, his face about an inch from the water. 

"Entoine I swear to God -" but my lungs felt like they were on fire. I couldn't take a full breath yet. All the air I had was going into keeping my legs kicking. 

The shadow was right underneath me now. Ten feet from the boat - I ducked my head underwater and paddled as hard as I could. Too slow - the body was intercepting me. It was going to block my route. About five feet away from the boat, it surfaced directly between me and the boat. 

But it wasn't an explosive surface like something swimming upward. It just floated there, face down in the water, looking as dead as I felt. I had to push the body out of the way to get to the boat. I kept expecting a hand to grab my ankle and pull me back down, but there was nothing. 

I climbed into the boat and fell on my back panting. My mask was cloudy, so I ripped it off. As soon as I could kneel again, I practically shoved Entoine straight into the water. 

"What the hell is wrong with you?" The push pressed him against the side of the boat. He tensed and relaxed, but didn't turn away from the water. It was like trying to wake someone from a deep sleep. He was just vacantly staring at the floating body now. 

The body was moving again though - its ear was anyway. Not a natural movement anymore - not like the body was moving on its own. It was like there was something trying to crawl out of it. 

As I watched, one of the black slugs pushed its way out of the ear. It got stuck part way and had to gnaw its way through the rest of the cartilage with razor sharp teeth like a leech. As it struggled out, the whole corpse shook like it was having a seizure. 

"It looks like you had it wrong," Entoine said in a sleepy voice. Did he just wake up? There's no way he could have slept through that. His face was still down next to the water though, and I couldn't get a clear look at him.

"What do you mean?"

"The floaters we found weren't the test subjects," he replied, finally pulling away from the water. His body was shivering slightly - somewhere between freezing to death and full body ecstasy. The tail end of a black slug had just finished slipping into his ear.  

"Of course they were. Why else would they be in the cells?" I asked. By the time the words were out of my mouth, I had already realized it. 

The bodies weren't the test subjects. The bodies were *hosts* to the test subjects. 

And they had already been free in the water since all those years ago when the [first floater broke free](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade).

<TEXT> "Well of course you're depressed. You never leave the house." 

"Your life isn't over just because hers is. I'm sorry but it's true." 

"Don't give up hope. You're going to meet someone else and be just as happy as you ever were."   

*Just as happy*. 

I'm tired of hearing it. What I'm going through - what I'm feeling - it's nobody's business but my own. I don't even know how to begin opening up to anyone who isn't Natalie. Ten years of feeling her warmth pressed against me when I wake. Ten years of whispering to each other in the dark. Ten years of making plans which will never be fulfilled. 

Nine months of drinking until I pass out on the couch with the TV on. I haven't been able to sleep in the bed we shared since breast cancer stole my wife from me. Hell, I've barely been able to sleep at all, and by the way people talk to me, I know they can tell.  

They're right of course, but that only makes it harder. *Knowing* they're right and still being unable to do anything about it is such a frustrating feeling - like realizing the right answer after you've already turned in your test. But I'm working through the grief in my own way. It has been a confusing time for me, but I've started keeping this journal to help me process my thoughts. While I will never forget her, in time I will learn to move on.

I'm meeting someone for dinner tonight. I won't call it a date - it probably is, but I don't want to put my mind in that place yet. Sarah, the daughter of an older client, is in town and I've promised to entertain her for the evening. I guess she has some self-esteem issues and I'm supposed to make her feel better about herself. We've chatted a few times and she's laughed at some of the things I said (even though I know they weren't funny). I would have even called her beautiful at a time when I still looked at girls that way. Well, here goes nothing...

---

Why the fuck didn't I listen to myself. I knew it was too soon. I felt tense the moment I sat down with her. I should have just left then. Everything was going fine though - more than fine she was fantastic - but then she started humming that damn 'my heart will go on' song. The one song stuck in her head just had to be the first song Natalie and I danced to at our wedding. What are the chances? 

I feel like an idiot for jumping up and racing to the bathroom. I don't know how long I stayed in there, but I was half-hoping she would be gone when I came out. To her credit, Sarah just laughed it off and acted like nothing happened. 

She did ask one strange thing though: she asked what Natalie would have thought about her... what an awkward silence that was. All I could manage was "My wife would have been happy to see me having a good time." That was a lie, of course. I couldn't exactly tell her that Natalie was the jealous type - if she knew I was out on a "date" now, then six feet of dirt wouldn't be enough to stop her. Sarah is so sweet to still worry about that even with Natalie gone...  

---

We're getting drinks again. She was even the one to invite me. I can't believe it. Natalie is the only one to ever chase me before. I've heard girls sometimes find men who are suffering to be the most attractive. Our indifference gives them a challenge - our damage gives them something to fix. I'm honestly excited about it. Even if nothing else happens, this will be good for me. 

She actually reminds me of Natalie a lot. The way she cups my hand in hers when she leans in to talk - and then there's the way she bites her lip when she's holding back a smile. She even wears the same kind of long dress with the high belt my wife used to wear, although she has the type of body which would do well in something more revealing...

Now that I think about it, Sarah and Natalie really have a lot in common. You don't think that... no it's impossible. Natalie is gone. I wanted to move on, right? And that's never going to happen by entertaining such ridiculous thoughts.   

--- 

Okay this is getting weird. Sarah won't stop mentioning Natalie. She spent the whole evening asking about how we met, and what I liked about her, and how we spent our time together. It was hard enough talking about my dead wife on a date, but then Sarah would stare at me as though she was analyzing my every answer.  

How am I supposed to forget Natalie like this? *No! Not forget! I didn't mean forget*... I'll never forget... but I think I *want* to. Is that so wrong? If thinking about her brings me nothing but sadness, is it so wrong to want to be happy? 

Natalie would have thought so. I promised I would never love anyone like I loved her. I promised she could never be replaced. Could she really still be holding me to that promise? What if Sarah was only a test - what if Natalie is still watching me, waiting for me to fail? I need to go for a walk. 

---

Natalie is coming over to my place tonight. I mean Sarah - I mean Natalie - I mean - 

The girl won't stop calling me. I'm getting text messages every ten minutes. Whatever I turn the conversation to, she always redirects it back to my dead wife. Natalie is still with me, I know it. She doesn't want me to move on. 

When she comes over tonight, I'm going to ask her straight out. If she says she's Sarah - if she says she isn't my wife - I'll leave it at that. 

But if she admits her spirit is still here... I don't know. I'll do whatever I can to help her find peace. 

---

Natalie has traveled to the other side. I'm finally free. For the first time since her death, her presence is finally gone. 

I didn't have the courage to ask the girl right away. I could tell she was reserved too, so we both had a couple of drinks. And I knew I needed to ask, but it still felt so awkward and wrong, so I just kept drinking. Finally I was able to push the words out: 

"Are you really Sarah, or are you Natalie's spirit?" 

"I'm everything she was," she said, and she kissed me. I closed my eyes, and I could taste Natalie's lips. I ran my fingers through Natalie's hair, and felt my wife's hands on my chest. 

It was so good to hold her again, even if this was the last time. It was so good to feel her skin beneath my hands. It was so good to choke the life out of her, sending her spirit back to rest.   

I hope she stays gone. This is the third time I've had to send Natalie back to the other side. I'm working through my grief in my own way though, and once Natalie has finally let go of me, I think I'll be able to let go of her too. As long as I have a body beside me, I think I can finally sleep in my bed again tonight.

<TITLE> Dead Man Floating </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-31 21:40:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I found the first floater when I was seven years old. It had washed up on the shore about a hundred yards from my family's summer house. It still looked mostly human - a bit swollen and decomposed, but whole enough for me to immediately recognize what it as. 

Even as a kid, I was never very squeamish. I used to watch my father skin the deer he caught on his hunting trips, and I would clean my own fish whenever I reeled one in from the salty lake. Finding a human body was the best thing that could have happened to me that summer. 

I thought about telling my parents, but there's no way they would let me play with it. Heck, they might even ban me from going down to the water at all, a thought which my seven-year-old brain equated to nuclear holocaust, an asteroid destroying the earth, or other disasters of similar magnitude. 

So I did what any clear thinking seven year old would do. I gathered up all the other kids I knew and charged them 5$ each to poke it with a stick. The salt water preserved it well enough for us to stomach the smell, but poking it would release some of the bloated gas still trapped in the carcass. I told them they could have their money back if they could lick it without throwing up. 

No-one got their money back. I made 60$ before one of the little snitches told his mother and she called the police. 

---

Next summer when I came back, the first thing I did was race back to the same spot. Sure enough, there had been two more bodies to wash up over the winter. These must have been sitting out in the sun for awhile though, because I couldn't even get close to them. 

My father had followed me that time, and I wasn't allowed to have any fun. The police said these bodies must be new, since they would have been completely rotten if they had been down there for a year. 

--- 

Over the next 10 years, there had been another three bodies found beside the lake. Each was slightly more decomposed than the last, but the police still insisted they had to be separate incidents because they were all still too fresh.  

None of them could be identified, and as they didn't fit any missing persons within the entire state, the police had no leads to discover who was dumping the bodies. They had given up, but I was never able to put the mystery out of my mind. 

I had my own theory. I decided those people didn't just die in the lake - they lived in it too. I thought that when they die, they float to the surface just like when humans die, they're buried in the ground. In retrospect the idea didn't really make sense, but it had started forming when I was so young that I refused to let go until the mystery had been resolved. 

---

When I was in college I became SCUBA certified for the sole purpose of finding where those bodies were coming from. I rented my own equipment and went back to that lake the summer of my freshman year. 

The water was incredibly buoyant from all the salt, and it took almost 20 pounds of weights before I would finally sink to the floor. It was slow progress working my way through the lake - six separate dives before I found what I didn't even know I was looking for. 

[*A sunken plane*](http://i.imgur.com/AP2to7K.jpg). I don't know how long it had been down here, but it looked rusted as shit. One of the doors had completed rusted off, and I was able to enter and look around. 

There were two more bodies inside, no-more than skeletons now. The inside of the plane was compartmentalized almost like it was broken into sealed jail cells. 

The locks on some of the cells had long since rusted open, and I'm guessing these are where the floaters came from. If they were in their own pressurized air chambers, then that explains how they were preserved for so long. As the plane deteriorated, they must have broken free and floated to the surface one by one. 

My most important discovery was the black box - although it was painted bright orange so it's a pretty stupid name. I brought it back with me and swam to the surface to research my findings. 

---

The plane was a [Douglass C-47](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_C-47_Skytrain), which was used for military transport during World War 2. They were still being used for decades afterward though. Some remained operational even up to 2012, so I still don't know how long it's been there. 

The flight data recorder had completely deteriorated, but the cockpit voice recorder still had some salvageable tape. Most of it was fuzzy or jumpy, but here is what I have. 

*"164, Roger*" (Something I couldn't make out)

*"Unable to make out your last message. Please repeat."*

*"It's out. Repeat - one of them has gotten out.*" 

*"Has the cockpit been comprised?"*

*"Negative. Cell block is*" (couldn't hear).
 
*"Please repeat, Captain.*" 

*"Repeat - cell block is compromised. It's letting the others out. Fucking Christ*" 

*"Remain calm, Captain. Can you neutralize the test subject?"* 

*"Not without compromising cockpit - how far am I from the landing field?"*

(Something unintelligible)

*"What the fuck is that supposed to mean?"*

(something unintelligible) *"... not granted permission land."*

*"Well then what the fuck am I supposed to do?*"

(something something) *"Mission terminated. Thank you for your service, Captain.*"

*"My service ain't over until I bring this bird down.*"

*"You're ordered to force collision. Test subjects must not escape.*" 

*"Like hell I am. I'm bringing her down into some water now. Request rescue operations.*" 

*"Mission terminated. Rescue operation denied.*" 

---

After that, all I could hear was engine sounds. It went on for about five minutes, and I was about to stop listening when I heard something like a snarling tiger. 

I guess I haven't changed that much since I was a kid, because I still don't want to bring this into the police. I've got another dive planned next week, and I'm going to try to break open the remaining cell blocks to [get a look inside.](http://facebook.com/sirtobiaswade).

<TEXT> *Don't stick your dick in crazy*. 

Words to live by. It's amazing how our mind can rationalize anything when we want something (or someone) badly enough though. 

When we first started dating, I didn't think Emma was *crazy*. Well that's not entirely true, but somehow I thought crazy was a good thing. Riding shopping carts down hills, holding a conversation with a dozen different voices, singing in public without a care in the world. 

She was innocent and free and wild, and I loved her for it. Every fun spontaneous thing that came into her mind, we did together. She forced me to open up as an individual and tore down walls and inhibitions I didn't even know I had. 

There were warning signs for the "other kind" of crazy too, but I just thought it was all an act. I didn't think she was really hearing voices, and even if she was, what was the harm in it? She never acted out bizarre commands or anything. It was just part of what made her unique. 

When she gave birth to our daughter Anastasia, I began to take her mental health a little more seriously. Emma was having visual as well as auditory hallucinations now, and she would get angry at me if I ever dismissed them as "not being real". 

We talked through it and did some research, and it sounded to me like she had schizophrenia. She always thought her voices were from a guardian angel, and I knew she wasn't going to be happy hearing otherwise. 

I had to get her to recognize they weren't real though, otherwise she would just encourage our daughter to believe in that stuff. Anastasia would already be genetically predisposed to her own hallucinations, and I didn't want that mentality to be reinforced. 

That was the worst fight Emma and I ever had. I didn't realize exactly how real it all was to her until I pushed her to get help. She wouldn't talk to me afterward for days, and even when she started to again, she would reference her guardian angel constantly. 

*"Ezekiel [her angel] reminded me to pick up milk at the store."*
 
or

*"Let's go see the star wars movie. Ezekiel said it was good."* 

It only got worse as the years went on. By the time Anastasia was nine years old, her mother and I couldn't even be in the same room together. Then one night my daughter was having nightmares, and instead of comforting her, I caught Emma telling Anastasia that she *should* be afraid. That she should *run* from it for God's sake. 

That was too much for me. We had a big fight right there in our daughter's room - screaming, cursing, throwing pillows - the whole bit. 

I wasn't going to let my daughter turn out to be like her, so there was no choice but to file for a divorce. I had recordings of her being crazy, and I would get custody of the kid. It wasn't going to be pretty, but that's how it had to be. 

I tried to talk to Anastasia about it, but she was so upset from watching our fight she couldn't deal with it. That night, I found a note in my daughters room while putting her to sleep. 

*I saw pictures of mommy and daddy when they first met.*
*They went on adventures. They smiled a lot.*
*Then there are pictures of them after I was born.*
*They aren't smiling anymore.*
*I'm sorry I did that to you. I hope you'll feel better when I'm gone. I love you mommy. I love you daddy. Goodbye.*

That was it. I asked Anastasia what it was and she shrugged. I got angry - I shouldn't have, but I was scared - and I yelled at her. She promised she didn't write the letter, and I calmed down. Yelling will only make things worse. I promised nothing that was happening was her fault and that she should never do anything bad to herself. 

She still insisted she hadn't written it though. That's when it clicked. The manipulative bitch. Emma wrote a fake suicide note just so I would feel bad and we would stay together. This was the last straw. That demon was not spending another night in my house. 
 
I ran to our bedroom and pounded on the door. Emma was in there, reading a book with a mask of innocence on her face. How I hated that innocence - she wore it like an excuse for nothing being her fault. I screamed at her and shoved the letter in her face. 

She screamed back. It was about five minutes before either of us could understand what the other was saying. Finally a string of clear words punctured through the violent words.

*I didn't write it. I swear on Ezekiel I didn't.*

We both stared at each other in silence as the awful realization dawned on us. If she hadn't written it then...

We both raced to our daughter's room, shoving each other out of the way as we went. The door was locked. 

*"Anastasia! Are you in there?*"

Silence. I rammed my shoulder against the door. 

"It's alright sweetie," Emma cooed. "Everything is alright. We love you and we love each other.*

I glared at Emma, but she shrugged. She was right though. This wasn't about us. This was about our daughter. 

*"Your mother and I love each other," I added. "I'm sorry we were fighting. Please open the door. Please baby."*

*"You will both be happy again when she's gone."* That wasn't my daughter's voice. It was deep and old - like a soldier who stared death in the face so many times it stopped phasing him in the least. There was a man in my daughter's bedroom!

Emma and I stared at each other. Her eyes were two quivering saucers. She turned back to the door. 

*"Don't do it Ezekiel. You're my angel. You're supposed to protect us."*

*"No," the deep voice. *'m supposed to protect you. And that's what I'm doing."*

Anastasia screamed. It couldn't have been anyone else. I hit the door so hard I could feel my shoulder dislocate. I didn't care. I hit again, and the door blew open. 

Anastasia was lying on her bed, a kitchen knife in her hands. The red circle of blood soaking into the bed was expanding with every second. There was no-one else in the room.

---

I still don't know what happened that night. Maybe it was Emma playing a trick on me - maybe it was real. After our daughter died, Emma and I couldn't even look at each other anymore. She left that night, and I haven't seen or spoken to her since. 

I never heard the voice again either, but sometimes in the deep of night I'll ask it a single question: *[Is Emma happy now?](https://www.facebook.com/A-Haunted-Mind-1256444524403181/)*

<TEXT> Hospital food is the worst. Youd think being sick would be miserable enough without them trying to push boiled kale and broccoli. My guess is they try to make you even sicker from the food just so youll stay and they can keep billing you. I joked about it with my son, but I didnt expect him to laugh.


They say coma patients can still hear your voice at some level. They say a familiar sound gives their subconscious something to hold onto, and believing he is still in there is what gives me something to hold onto. Without that belief, I would just be hollow.


So everyday after work I sit with him and talk. Ill tell him about my day, or the latest news, or just sit and read to him from a book. I tell him that I miss him, and his mother misses him too. I know she doesnt come to visit, but thats just because its too hard for her to be here. When he wakes up, I know hell understand.


Ive been waiting for the last two months. Even the nurse started rolling her eyes when she sees me. I can tell they gave up on him, but I havent. And its not just blind hope and Im not just lying to myself because the alternative is unthinkable; its because I know something they dont.


I read my sons journal after he fell into the coma. I was looking for some reference to drugs or something he might have taken which could have caused this. In the last entry  written right before the night he didnt wake up from  I found something completely different than I expected.

---

December 20th: 2016
-
My dream last night spoke to me. It said:
-

*We share a birthday.*


*And a mother.*


*And a name.*


*But you arent my twin, or my brother, or any other type of relative.*


*Because we also share the same body. Its been that way for as long as I can remember, but I dont think you even know I exist.*


*When you open your eyes, I feel myself slipping into a dream which descends upon me so softly I barely notice it isnt real. I dream of going about your life and watching the world through your eyes, but you are the one in control. I watch my body eat, but I do not taste your food. I hear my body laugh, but do not feel your joy.*


*Only when youre sleeping do I find myself in control again. I can take your mind wherever I like, and I know you dream of my life in the same way I dream of yours because Ive dreamt of you writing in your journal about my adventures.*


*Were not the same person though, and in truth I am jealous that you own the body during the day. Dont pretend you havent dreamt of me begging you for a turn  just to smell the air and feel the sun upon my face. I know you remember me weeping through the long hours of the night until the morning steals your mind from me.*


*Even the nightmares didnt work. Ravaging your mind only made you afraid to fall asleep. It only robbed me of the precious little control I already had. Ive tried everything within my power to get your attention, but Im done playing games. You are a selfish boy, and you will be punished.*


*You can fight me for as long as you want, but I will teach you what it is like to be the one on the inside. I dont care how long it takes; the next time you open your eyes, I will be the one rising from your bed. Everyone who has ever cared for you will pay for loving the impostor who has stolen my body for so long.*


---

After that, he didnt wake up. As much as I hate myself for saying this  theres even a part of me that doesnt want him to. I want to look him in the eye and tell him everything is alright, but I dont want to have to wonder who will be looking back.


Its an absurd fear of course, but a mind can play funny tricks on you after such long hours of lonely vigil. Day in and out watching him sleep  its easy to imagine the black eyes of some evil spirit flashing open.


Reading about these horrendous nightmares in his journal only deepend my fear. Its all I had left of him though, so i kept reading them over and over again until I had each memorized by heart.


My poor boy has been visiting hell in his mind every night for months leading up to his coma. He wrote extensive passages on each trial, even drawing pictures of some of the beasts which tormented him. The worst one to me was a recurring nightmare about hands trying to rip out of his body from the inside out. They would climb up his throat and out his mouth to strangle him, or grab his spine from the inside, or break straight through the stomach and crawl out of his body.


Sometimes I stayed with him through the night  just in case his condition varied then. I would usually fall asleep in the chair beside him before morning, and invariably my mind would trace back to those nightmare worlds. Worse still were the nights my dreams played tricks on me and I imagined him waking up, only to actually wake up and see him unmoved.


That is until last week when it wasnt a trick. I didnt really expect anything to happen, but I stayed with him just because it was getting more difficult to go home to his mother. She has given up and closed off from the world, and nothing I could do or say brought her the slightest glimmer of relief. But last night was different, because he finally did wake up.


I know I wasnt dreaming because I couldnt sleep with the commotion in the next room over. Mrs. Juniper was having another grand mal seizure and it took both the night nurses just to hold her down and keep her from hurting herself.


Somehow above all that noise a small rustle caught my attention. I looked up from his journal and saw my sons left foot slowly moving back and forth beneath the thin sheet. I called for a nurse, but they were still busy with Mrs. Juniper. I kept telling myself it was excitement that made my heart race, but part of me could not shake the fear his journal had instilled upon me.


I stroked his face and he responded to my touch, mumbling something inaudible. I couldnt even breathe for the anticipation.


Nurse! Nurse hes waking up!


Well be with you in a moment!


Well screw them. They werent the ones to wait by his bed every day. They were the ones who had given up a long time ago.


Can you hear me? Do you know who I am? I asked. My eagerness sent my fingers digging into his shoulders. I needed him to feel me  to know I was there. A doubt in the back of my mind let slip the thought that I was also holding him down  just in case it wasnt him who woke.


I knew the truth the second his eyes opened. It wasnt my son. I dont know how, but a father knows. When he started to laugh, my blood ran cold. He gripped my hands hard with a strength which should be impossible for an emaciated boy who hasnt moved in months. It was all I could do just to break free.


Who are you? I asked, but I already knew. All those pages detailing his nightmares  all those descriptions of the other thing inside him  they all came flooding back. How cruel it was  how many times it had threatened him  tortured him  killed him a hundred times over in his dreams. 

Dad he whispered, smiling at me with his cold eyes.


No. You arent my son.


Its me dad. Whats going on? Where am I? He tried to sit up, but I forced him back down into the bed.


No! I dont care if I was screaming. I dont care if I was hurting him. I waited this long for my son  I wanted my son. What have you done with him?


What are you talking about? he looked like he was on the verge of tears, but I wasnt going to let him fool me. A flash of recognition, and then: Youve read my journal. You mean the other boy.


What have you done with my son?


There isnt anyone else anymore, he said, and he was laughing again.


He killed him. He killed my son. He tortured and killed my boy, and now he was laughing. He wont fool me, but he would fool my wife. She would be so happy to see him that she wouldnt even look twice. I couldnt let this murderer get away with it. I wouldnt let any more pain come to my family.


He fought like a wild animal, but I was still active everyday and I was stronger. I held the pillow on his face, and the soft fabric pressed in upon his nose and mouth. I wish he had never woken up  that he had just died in his sleep. I cant imagine how much my son suffered before this monster killed him, but he was going to pay.


Everything alright in there? the nurse opened the door.


I fluffed the pillow and put it back under the boys head.


Everything is fine. I was just having a bad dream.


You sure? she asked. I thought I heard shouting. She glanced at the boy. He lay so peacefully he didnt even draw breath.


Nope, just my active imagination.


Thats what happens when you sit up every night, the nurse said. Go home and get some sleep. Ill let you if his status changes.


I picked up my coat and my book and followed her out. I think youre right, I said. Im going home, see you tomorrow.


But I wouldnt come back tomorrow. There was no-one to come back to. I got a call later that night telling me my son had suffocated. They say that happens sometimes with coma patients  the automatic functions of their parasympathetic nervous system just turn off just like the conscious ones did.
I thanked her and hung up, but I didnt tell her she was wrong. My son had died two months ago.

My wife doesnt know what happened, but she still hasnt spoken once in the last week. There have been no shortage of other people wishing their condolences though  estranged relatives, neighbors, coworkers.


His English teacher even stopped by my house to offer her sympathy. She went on and on about what a wonderful student he was. His essays were always the most imaginative she had ever seen, always going above and beyond what was required.


For example, one of her assignments was to keep a dream journal, but he asked instead to write a fictitious story which he was going to publish alongside pictures from the yearbook. It was going to be all about this made up nightmare world where there were two minds living in the same body. She asked if I still had his work so it could at least still be published, but I told her I didnt.


Which is true. I destroyed the journal the same night I killed my son.
