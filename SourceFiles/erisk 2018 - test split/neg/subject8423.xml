<TEXT> Raditz was toying with Goku in his base form because he's his brother and he had kidnapped his nephew.  Normal sayin MO is to go Ozaru asap, which gives an immediate x10 power boost.  Raditz' powerlevel is 1,500, but would be 15,000 in Ozaru form.  For perspective, Nappa was 4,000, Goku against Vageta was just a little over 9,000, and Vageta was 18,000.  Vageta was a planet buster at 18,000 and Ozaru Raditz is pretty close to that in power.

Raditz 10/10 except round 3 where it's 9/10 since Yusake knows he has to blow up the moon or cut off Ozaru Raditz' tail but o doubt he could take base form Raditz especially after taking a trashing from Ozaru Raditz. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If it's a serious relationship, and since this is your first Mother's Day together, you need to get her something very nice and thoughtful.  Probably something nicer than what you got for your mother.  Hopefully you have an idea of what she wants/needs.  For instance, my wife loves the movies and has been complaining all her shoes are old.  I got her a couple new pairs of sandals and flats and a gift card for the movie theater.

You should also plan to spend the day with your SO (provided it's a serious relationship) and maybe have dinner/lunch with your mother with your SO and her children.  You might feel like your in the matrix dodging bullets on this one, good luck buddy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The civil war.  While slavery was definitely a huge part of the civil war, tariffs, trade policies, and a slew of domestic policies were enacted that hurt the south.  When Lincoln, a very pro-northern politician, won the presidency in a split that looked an awful like the Mason-Dixon Line, and then proceeded to trick the south into giving up a lot of states rights to keep Slavery legal and then abolish slavery, you understand that the North and South had been at odds for a while and the North won.  Even as far back as the founding of this country, Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas were always more at odds with the other colonies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the most part, the social construct of gender is mainly decided by biological sex.  Other behaviors asp contribute to our gendered social norms.  Sometimes people can enjoy or feel more comfortable in a gender role that is opposite of their biological sex, which isn't too odd.  However, when someone feels they have the wrong biological sex is when you COULD call it body dysmorphia. 

Problems arise because psychology is a soft science, meaning empirical data is hard or impossible to come by.  For instance, I remember a study done of two twins, separated at birth, who both developed OCD that centered around cleaning their houses.  They developed this independently without ever meeting but it gets interesting when one claimed they developed it from growing up in a hoarder house and the other said their adoptive parents passed on their strict cleanliness to him.  This situation is like a psychologists wet dream, but even this example is not empirically sound as there are still variables that you can't control.

So how do we decide when someone identifies with a gender that is opposite from their expected sex or when someone mentally feels they are the wrong sex?  We have no idea what to look for physically and we can't rely on people to self-diagnose.  There answer is who the fuck knows.  If you come up with one you could make a lot of money. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It means your the most skilled magician and have the best mind for the job.  It also comes with an ill-defined power boost that's less clear than how the Flash works.  For instance, a fight between Dr. Doom and Strange would likely end in a stale-mate but Strange has a much altruistic and stable mind than Doom.  

Of course we all know DOOM simply lost the fight as part of his intricate mechanizations because DOOM would never lose to Strange if being sorcerer supreme were the goal of DOOM. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Childbirth and childcare.  Italy, as an EU country, doesn't have to factor in childcare, birth, etc for women alone as healthcare, parenting styles, and other progressive social and economical factors take gender out of the equation for the most part.  The US and Korea plug their ears when they hear paternity leave and the US starts screaming "LA LA LA" when you bring up universal healthcare.  From a business standpoint, you want someone who will not take time off to be pregnant and give birth, which you have to, by law, provide maternity leave.  And then there's the very real statistic of women not rejoining the workforce after having children so now all the training you gave that person is gone too.  

Want to get the wage gap down to EU levels?  Give men more paternal rights and cultural freedom.  Simple as that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I agree being sweaty, hairy, and stinky is not quite as bad as hemorrhage Week, you're missing the best parts.  It's not that we are hairy, or that we are sweat, or that we are stinky.  The trifecta of being hairy, sweaty, AND stinky is the perfect mix for the perfect sauce.  First the hair gets growing, insulating our most moist areas for some godawful reason.  This same hair will grow in thick and course enough to cause rashes between the leg and sack and underarms unless groomed.  But then the sweat starts coming in.  Know the feeling of pulling your bra off at the end of the day?  The feeling of cool air against bare skin that has been insulated and contained all day?  We don't get that, our pits, balls, and ass (hairy man ass is a male secret, keep it on the DL) stay stuffed into our course, home-made sweaters no matter where or when.  Once that sweat sits in that hair all day, really rubbing the skin raw, the smell sets end.  There's nothing like the smell of swamp ass and sweaty balls pooling in the taint hair and basting for several hours to get the strew brewing.  Gonna hike a leg up, crane an arm over and adjust yourself?  The smell coming from your armpit is enough to make YOURSELF gag. 

So now your hobbling around, insides of your groin chaffed pink making it hurt to walk, and arms moving like a T-Rex so no one drone strikes you for suspected chemical attacks.  Even when you cool off, the smell doesn't go awake, only gets worse.  What smells worse than fresh taint juice?  Stale taint juice.

Emotionally, it was something beautiful, physically it was disgusting and no one should think different.  The advice I gave to my friend who was nervous about his wife having their first child was, "if you've field dressed a deer it's less gross than that so don't worry about feinting.  Your wife will likely poop herself too but don't tell her if she does." </TEXT>

<TEXT> This has gone back and forth but most agree it's a tie between getting hit in the nuts and giving birth for many reasons explained in the link below.  Not surprising when you consider its the same parts of the body hurting.  The key difference is one lasts for 8ish hours, barring complications, and the other can happen my surprise and repeatedly.  Personally, I wouldn't want to get kicked in the nuts every few minutes for 8 hours and I imagine most women wouldn't want to suddenly and unexpectedly give birth several times throughout the week.

<TEXT> The Star Wars Universe has something ours doesn't: the force.  We, in our galaxy, lose our balance or stumble for many reasons.  For Star Wars, everyone, everything, and every action flows through and is influenced by the force (and the force influenced by it.). It has been this way since the dawn of time, primitive Thok is an asshole, steals food, hurts people, and is generally a dick.  Thok gets into an accident be he was unbalancing the force and the force rebounded strong enough to cause our poor primitive's death.  This has been the rule of the galaxy since before wheels were invented.  It's not a stretch to assume that this universal karma is noticed and influences society.  If you stand behind railings, put shielding over exposed power sources, or grate exhaust vents then it looks like you're preparing for the universe(the force) to rebound at you.  You're saying you do bad things.  And that assumption wouldn't be wrong in the Star Wars universe because the force does seek balance.  Do you think it was a coincidence that the Death Star was blown up shortly after destroying a planet?  Maybe if it were destroyed once, but it was destroyed twice, by powerful force users both times, no less. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be fair, I do have a job and children.  It's easy to go on Reddit and up vote a few posts I agree with while taking a twosie but it's another thing entirely to devote a good portion of my attention to /r/place since just hopping on and placing one pixel is pointless and the only way to make anything meaningful is to watch the timer all day.  I don't frequent /r/t_d at all, just upvote or comment whenever it's relevant to me, but I'll probably get downvoted because no one will read this far; which is the point, because /r/t_d has made enemies of everyone so everyone will be against them in /r/place.  They're finally the Nazis they always wanted to be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Allegedly they only do that to up and comers, people rising in the ranks.  Say someone did a good job on Trumps campaign trail, does a lot of speaking and fundraising, then wins a state senate seat in 2018.  They go out with their fellow GOP members to celebrate, celebrate too hard, then one of their "friends" has the sit down chat the next morning with the pictures because he was tapped years ago.  Then you do business as usual but then you take $1,000 to vote for something a certain way.  If you don't, you get exposed.  Now you filibuster this or speak out against this person.  Maybe in a year you help another rising star celebrate and take pictures.

You toe the line between too afraid to speak out and benefitting too much from the arrangement.  As you do more fucked up stuff, your threshold for being too afraid and the amount you benefit go up.  Then you're secretary of interior. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The eye of Sauron is able to look over vast differences and the rings of power the 9 ringwraiths wear connect them with Sauron spiritually and mentally.  So Frodo puts on the ring and Sauron tells the wraiths "he's on your 7," and it goes from there.

As for how them knowing where to look, you can chalk that up to good old detective work.  Sauron had more than the ringwraiths in and around the shire looking for the ring.  It wouldn't take long to get pointed toward Bilbo who is famous for being rich and going on magical adventures.  Crows would spot them walking through the fields and report back to dark men who report back to the ringwraiths.  The whole of the shire turned into a noose that Sauron was slowly tightening for Frodo, not even Aragorn would take the roads. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright there's a lot of questions here.  As far as hard numbers go, we only know the speed of sound and the speed of light.  As far as physics are concerned in the DCverse, there is also a speed you can go to break the time barrier and the dimension barrier, which we do not have numbers for as we humans are unable to conceptualize outside of our 3 dimensional existence. (Brief note, dimensions as planes of reality and dimensions as alternate realities are two distinct things with the same name.). As far as who can go what speed, we also don't have hard numbers for this either.  The best we can do for speed is to make tiers.    Wonder Woman is fast, she is blessed by the messenger God, but she is not as fast as superman.  Superman is fast, he can go fast enough to move through time.  Superman is not as fast as the flash.  The flash is where the buck stops.  The flash is the avatar of the Speed Force which is a parallel dimension full of nothing but momentum.  Flash is able to splice himself into our dimension and this parallel dimension and exist in both at the same time to give himself his unmatched speed.  This is a balancing act and a damn good way to explain his inconsistent speed.  The more Flash goes into the speed force and the less in our dimension, the faster he is able to go.  If Flash goes too far into the speed force, he can't leave.  So Flash can push himself to outrun death one month, when his mind his clear and his body healthy, and then barely match Supes after finding his wife in bed with Reverse Flash and coming off of a bout of food poisoning.  Flash's greatest fear is losing himself in the speed force. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Arthur Dent just can't catch a break.

Round 1: Arthur stumbles and mumbles protests but the children are left at his door.  Arthur, for all intents and purposes, is a perfectly normal man, if a bit dull and boring.  

Round 2: Getting the orphans from Dent is like taking candy from a baby.  The only wrench I can see for Olaf is if Arthur calls in his best friend Ford Prefect to help which is, admittedly, fairly likely.  Dent would take a background role to Ford and Olaf antics.  If it comes down to it, Ford is a space hobo with absurd technology and the twins are his ticket to having enough money to get off earth, I just don't see Olaf outsmarting the clever Ford Prefect and would eventually get turned into a toaster or something.

Round 3: as the events of The Guide play out, the children would escape the fate of earth and end up on the Vogon ship.  Provided they survive to make it on the Heart Of Gold, Trillion would adopt the orphans (since Ford and Arthur really have no interest in raising children) thus negating the last two books of the series.  The children, as clever as they are, fair well in the Hitchiker's Guide world with Trillian as their mother. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maiar don't die in the sense that you're thinking of.  They can have their physical bodies destroyed in a myriad of ways but, for a Maiar and Ainur, the physical body is something they make to interact with physically-based life.  Maiar are not physical being.  As far as "respawning" after dying, most Maiar are able to make their own bodies but can be given bodies by their patron Ainur, as was the case for the Istari, the five wizards.  But for making their own body, or making anything of significance, this permanently drains a Maiar and Ainur from a sort of spiritual well.  Once the well runs dry the Maiar because wholly incorporeal, as was the case for Sauron after the war of the ring.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Diet and exercise for me?  No.  I've always been able to balance my diet and count my calories in my head.  I'm solidly in the "overweight" category but several years of children will do that.  My wife doesn't.  And she started off very heavy and has gained weight and breast size from the pregnancies, which is totally understandable but it tipped her over the 300 mark and I just don't know what to do.  No conversations about seeing our grandkids graduate or wanting to take back up hiking when the children are older have worked (I hiked, she did not.). She's bought elliptical bikes and treadmills which we really couldn't afford for them to sit and collect dust.  The weight issue is tables until our children are older as any sort of serious life changes like that are nearly impossible with a 1 and 3 year old.  I hope she will agree to change something before a heart attack or a stroke happens.

And I admit I make excuses for her and myself.  It looks like I pig out because she'll see me eat a lot for dinner but I know I've had less than 1000 calories that day.  I'm not setting a good example.  And I assert myself as much as I should.  She's insisting on doing the shopping when I know she will buy sweets and frozen foods.  Convenience food.  During Christmas time she came home with three whole cakes because they were for sale.  I made her give one away as a gift but she wouldn't budge with the others.  She got them because I bought one before and she really likes it.  

Sorry for unloading on you like this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's two sides for all stories.  For instance, my wife is a G cup and wants reduction and I out my foot down on us not spending the money for it because insurance won't cover it.  Insurance won't cover it because she is very obese and, just like the insurance company, I think getting breast reduction is both dangerous and unnecessary when she could instead choose to lose weight with diet an light exercising.  I've even told her we will pay for the reduction if they're still uncomfortably large when she's down to a healthy weight (though insurance would probably pay for it at that point).  It's been a sore point for two years and no diets have changed.  

I wouldn't get a divorce of she went ahead and did it.  Probably.  We're married and have children.  But if she were just a long-term girlfriend and she went ahead with it (and we shared expenses or something) then I could see that ending the relationship fast.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh hi OP, was just talking about you.  From what I've gathered from the, admiringly very limited, slice of your life, you seem to either:

A, lack confidence to assert yourself in your relationship until very recently.  This deviation from the norm and sudden shift after YEARS of letting your GF act like one of those NEET neckbeards (legbeards?) from 4chan, she feels attacked and abused.

B, have let yourself be manipulated and abused by a narcissist until you've let her coast through life on your dollar.  You're stopping her gravy train and she slashing out as a result.  She could seriously have convinced herself that you're abusing her or she's finding out the signs so she can lie about them. 

C, just like A but in this your an absolute dick, make her feel self conscious about working, and belittle her for not having a job or cleaning often.  This one is not likely.

In the first two scenarios you lack confidence to assert yourself (your goals, your wants, your needs, your expectations from your partner[you can have those], your ideal home environment, etc) but you seem to be doing better!  Unfortunately either you or your SO are not handling your sudden change in the relationship but I'd guess your SO is just floundering because her free ride is over. 


Or you're just a dick, who knows, we only have your side of the story and no one is the villain of their own story.  The facts you've presented don't make you a Disney villain unless you lock her in a tower or something, but we still only know half of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is my take: he's a tall guy, usually the tallest guy in the room and probably has been most of his life.  His family is likely tall, his friends know him as the tall friend, you get the picture.  I'm guessing being tall is one of the things he uses to define himself.  Being tall is, of course, a masculine trait which is also why he chooses to identify himself.  So when you make yourself taller, almost as tall as him, you are, in his mind, making yourself for masculine and therefore emasculating him. 

To draw a comparison, imagine your boyfriend had a beautiful flowing beard, his whole family has beautiful flowing beards, and people comment and compliment his beard all the time.  And then you grow a neat, trim beard every now and then.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well fuck.  My great grandparents on my father's side were part of an old rich German family.  They were not just Nazis but SS Nazis so my karma is screwed.  On the flip side, I could see my grandfather, who was exiled for marrying a gypsy woman, and my grandma, said gypsy woman, being able to teach me a lot of magic from their respective backgrounds.  I could see my grandma knowing divination and maybe some minor luck magic, she taught me how to read tarot cards in real life anyway.  My grandfather would be a bit of a wildcard, as old families tend to have specialization.  For fun, let's say he specialized in elemental magic to make them battle-magic themed.  Having bad karma would suck though.

My familiar, I would choose something logical and grounded.  I connect a lot with my German ancestry as I have it on both sides of my family, so I would look for something from Germanic religions though that might require a trip to a potentially hostile area of my Nazi family is still around, which they probably would be.  They probably wouldn't kill me on sight as I have my grandfather's blond hair and blue eyes but my goal would be to usurp those Nazi pieces of shit and use their knowledge and power for good.  I think it was Assault who said "who doesn't like fighting Nazis?"  My implement would be an eye carved from a holly tree that I carved myself, I'm good enough at wood working to make it.  The eye to pay homage to Woten and his own sacrifice for knowledge, a holly bush to draw parallels between myself and Baldr who's foolhardiness got him killed by a arrow made of holly, and the wood is natural and would help me get in the good graces of Frigg, who rules over nature.  I want to win the Germanic gods back over after my family perverted them.  

Edit: upon looking into it, I would summon forth and partner with my family's Fulgja/Dis, a Germanic Shapshifting/Valkyrie type creature that attaches to one family's fate. </TEXT>

The symbol of sexy SS Elsa stays in your head and the symbols around her, the swastika, SS logo, etc, become normalized in the mind.  Once the symbols become normalized to someone but other people still treat them like they represent the deaths of millions of people or something, it creates a disconnect from the reality of the symbols.  This is when radicalization can take root.

The Nazi's swastika is distinct enough, or as distinct as a simple symbol like the swastika can be, to differ from its use in Hindu culture and religion.  Remember that the Nazis took the swastika, inverted it, and tipped it on its side specifically to make it distinct.  If the Alt-right turned Pepe orange for all its memes or white supremacist universally portrayed Elsa with a  buzz cut and bright red make up, I'd say those were hate symbols as well.

<TEXT> The problem with this is that LotR has a power leak, power is literally leaking out of the world and things grow weaker over time.  If the opposite were true, Gandalf and the Balrog, who are both from the first age, would have their powers set in the first age.  If a power creep happened over the course of the first age all the way to the third age, then the Balrog would be killed by the dwarves of Moria, Sauron would be stronger than Morgoth with the ring, but Aragorn would be even stronger.  Aragorn would end up fighting Tulkas, the god of fighting, in order to get a good fight.  

Reversing the power scale in LotR just wouldn't work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tolkien often lamented how the English didn't really have expansive, deep rooted myths and legends like the French and Germans.  The English had King Arthur but even that was a French translation (the original text is title Morte De Arturo).  This can be traced back to the Norman's conquest, where they tried and succeeded to destroy the almost all of the Anglo-Saxon's history and culture.

This sadnesses at the lack of myths and texts is often attributed to be the initial inspiration for Tolkien to write the Lord of the Rings and all its accompanying texts.  I don't think it's a leap at all to think Tolkien would be happy to have his world expanded on.  Fittingly, when most people I know think of British myths and legends, Lord of the Rings is one of the first things they think of.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For round one, there are several.  I would say Doctor Facilier would be the weakest to beat Batman in a random encounter.  He's very clever and uses several layers of trickery, I could see him getting one over on Bats in a random first encounter.  He'd get his ass handed to him in every meeting after, though.

For round two, this is harder.  I can only think of one Villain who could survive a day of prep batman and that's Chernobog, a major Demon.  And I would only give this a 6/10 for the archdemon because the thing that defeats him might just be acquired in a day.  I'm not trying to circle-jerk Prepman, but all Disney villains who aren't human are defeated by Mcguffins.  Batman can find the shit out of a Mcguffin.  Chernobog is the only one we don't see defeated by a plot device, only banished by some divine spirit.  However, demons, throughout all of fiction, are defeated by humans and mcguffins.  You could replace Batman with Rational Man with a Shotgun and you'd run into the same problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So there are a few different periods of time where Gohan can go SSJ2 and this wildly changes the outcome.

Cell Saga Gohan going SSJ2 would but up a good fight, but just doesn't have the raw states to take on Superman.  Saiyan Man Gohan is much closer, as Gohan got a significant power boost between the Cell and Buu sagas but he isn't that stronger than when we compare him too... Mystic Gohan.  This is where I can honestly say Superman loses.  Gohan goes from being below SSJ2 Vegeta to above SSJ3 Goku.  This Gohan is the strongest we've ever seen Gohan, though Super is still ongoing.  Up until Mystic Gohan, superman has kept the raw states advantage but I would say Gohan, always the stronger ki user thanks to his training with Piccolo, overtakes Superman in strength and speed handily.  Add a truly ridicules mastery of martial arts, Mystic SSJ2 Gohan is the only Gohan who could beat Superman. </TEXT>

Despite joining Morgoth, Sauron retained his powers of making.  So Sauron is a much better inventor and builder than any person or nation that has existed.  Those drawings found in DaVinci's notebooks?  Sauron could easily build better.  Those amazing feats of engineering by Alexander the Great and the Romans?  Mud huts next to what Sauron could build.  It is impossible for men to design, craft, or build (with few very specific exceptions) than Sauron.  Those 50 thousand men might as well be small children with sticks trying to beat up a tank. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To understand why the unforgivable curses are illegal you have to understand what these curses inherently are.  To even be able to cast an unforgivable curse, you have to want to cast it.  You have to want someone to have no free will, you have to want someone to suffer, you have to want someone to die.  Not only do you need this want, you have to be convinced that you're just the strapping young wizard to get it done.  To put it in more muggle legal terms, just being able to cast the curse proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, ability and intent on the caster as casting the spell is impossible otherwise. </TEXT>

There are many different second bests who are not far behind Yoda, but a Jedi who devotes their whole life to studying one aspect of the Jedi way is still second best to Yoda in any category.  This is why Sidious retreats.  Sidious is an opportunist, as his name implies.  He was being beaten down in saber combat so used is gile and words.  Sidious will come at you sideways even when he could best you in your strength, it's not worth the risk to him.  Yoda has no weaknesses, there is no way to come at Yoda that he isn't the best at.  So while Sidious is stronger than Yoda in the end, it's much more risk to fight the squirrelly bastard than it's worth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Odin is extremely powerful and above just about t any threats the Earth ever encounters.  Odin is able to slap Thanos around like a child and able to repel a hungry Galactus.  On top of physical, Odin is one of the strongest magic users in the universe.  Some feats:

Teleports every human on Earth at once

Creates a pocket dimension and imprisons a god in it

Blows up an entire galaxy in an instant

There was also the time he stalemates Galactus in a telepathic battle, got fed up with Galactus's face not being crushed inward, so he flew up and head butted Galactus and knocked them both out cold.  He also physically overpowered a being (Surter) who has the physical strength to destroy the universe.  Thor is a god, he's strong.  But Odin is a God with a capital 'G', there aren't many things as strong as he is. </TEXT>

I then moved to the south where we had heatstroke advisories--if you are outside doing mild physical(like walking) activity you risk heat stroke.  Also blizzards and tornados.

<TEXT> I think it's a bit different for Mormons and the rest of Christianity.  From what I've encountered, Lutherans, Catholics, baptists, etc, view other people as doing Christianity wrong or interpreting God's will wrong.  But Mormonism has books besides the new and Old Testament, have much different views, and are mostly isolated to the US.  Don't get me wrong, they still all dislike each other just the same, but Mormonism is definitely a league in its own as far as other Christian sects go.  My source is being in a large Bible Belt state during Romney's bid for presidency, so it could easily be skewed. </TEXT>

Sandman is a concept given physical form, as widely held concepts are want to do (the concept of conquest is someone you do NOT want to meet.). Sandman is sleepiness personified.  But a concept is about rigidity, strictness, and order.  A concept can't deviate from its progenitor concept because that's all it is.  In all the supernatural realm, you'd be hard pressed to find a more opposed pair.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It looks like glaistig uaine/Valkyrie going by silhouette alone--which isn't much to go by.  I think having a protagonist that starts head-and-shoulders above everyone else would be a good exorcise for Wileyhog as it deviates from his norm.  I think having Valkyrie as the protagonist would lend itself to Abbadin being the antagonist of Warm 2: Eletrical whalaroo, but now I'm building vague theories on vague theories when in reality it's much more likely the protagonist of Warm 2 is someone entirely new. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im going to use Arthur and Merlin from Le Morte D'Arthur for this.

This is a spite thread.

Round one.  Aragorn isn't a fighter, he's a ranger so this isn't an immediate stomp.  What's more, Arthur is fairly strong out of armor as he regularly runs around in full plate.  However, Aragorn is above peak human in reflexes and at peak human for strength and speed.  Arthur is just a really talented and practiced knight.  I give this 7/10 for Aragorn.  It would be closer to 50-50 but Aragorn fights dirty and Arthur doesn't.

Round two:  Right off the bat, Arthur comes out ahead.  Arthur has two magical swords, one of them Excalibur, a magic spear that always hits, and a horse that never tires.  Aragorn has Anduril, a sheath that keeps Anduril clean, sharp, and untarnished, a cloak that hides him from his enemies, and Mithril Mail.  This is a close one, as Arthur's gear is honestly better than Aragorn's but Aragorn is the superior fighter.  In a battle in a ring, I give this 6/10 for Arthur, but if the environment can be used in anyway, Aragorn gets this 8/10

Now for the spite.  Round three: Gandalf would win 10/10 against Aragorn, Arthur, and Merlin.  While he is limited in using his power during the war of the ring, I'm assuming he is unbound here.  Remember that Gandalf defeated the Balrog, unbound Gandalf is stronger than the Balrog and Gandalf isn't even a combat-based Maiar.  Gandalf is a minor deity.  Unbound Gandalf can speak words that are true because he wills it to be true, unbound Gandalf crushes spirits until the mortal who dared to stand against him is left catatonic.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whenever I have trouble coming up with names, I open my copy of the Silmarillion and go to the name index.  If you have ever read the Silmarillion, you will note that the creators of WoW did the same thing. For human men, a few quick ones I notice:

Anarion, brother of Isildur, distant uncle of Aragorn

Beren, cut a jewel from Mothoth's crown to merry a half-angle, half-elf woman, this lead to the creation of Aragorn's royal line.

Curufin, fifth son of Faenor, father of celebrimbor, called "Curufin the Crafty"

Dairuin, one of the twelve companions of Barahir on Dorthonion.

Ered, roughly translates to "The Mountain" from high Sindarin.

Firimar, roughly translates to "the Mortal" from high Sindarin.

Galdor, "Galdor the Tall", son of Hador, lord of Dor-Lomin, father of hurin and Huor, slaim by Eithel

You get the picture.  You can get the Silmarillion in most book stores or even rent it from most libraries. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Going out of character, raid bosses are always taken down by the players, but in lore it's always "So-and-so with a group of adventurers."  Arthas?  Tirion and a group of adventurers.  Death wing?  Thrall, the aspects, and a group of adventurers.  So in the story you have for example, Varian Wrynn fighting Onyxia with adventurers helping him.  Arthas, Onyxia, and death wing all have a reason to attack Tirion (the Ashbringer), Varian (complete her plan to rule Stormwind), and Thrall (destroy the Demon Soul).  They don't have time to turn and attack a weak Mage pelting them with frostbolts that simply sting.  In Lore, these characters are the tanks and their respective raid bosses rank them as target #1. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Something else entirely.  We find intelligent life, but the likely hood of one or both parties from being something completely repulsive about the other is astronomically high.  Say, for instance, we meet an intelligent race who eats vast quantities of their own children.  Children not unlike our own 3-7 year olds in mental and emotional maturity.  This species didn't have predators or hostile environments nor abundant resources like we did, so a conscious effort had to be made to curtail their population.  In this case, these aliens product a dozen offspring, nurture them until they develop the ability to communicate and move independently, then cull them by eating the weaker ones.  This, in their society, is seen as a honorable and good thing.  Never have they even considered not eating babies.  A direct translation from their language from ours for the phrase "to do good" is the same as "to eat babies."  Do you think we could get along with this species?

What if we're the disgusting ones.  What if we meet a species who are able to remotely feel empathy as if it were literally happening to them.  This species would turn toward our planet(s) and be appalled at the suffering and rigor of our lives.  "Why do we feel humans killing each other, why do we feel human life ending through lack of life sustaining material, why do we feel humans suffering a deep cut, why do we feel humans depressed, why do we feel humans disappointed, why do we feel humans frustrated with rigor?"  These aliens would not understand why people starve to death or why people get college educations.  Both make negative emotions.  They wouldn't get why we wouldn't change ourselves to never feel bad feelings again, like they have.  They would be horrified by how much bad and painful things humans feel on a daily basis.

I hope we never meet aliens. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fair enough.  Keep in mind that many of these values are true for some sects and not for others.  Turn the other cheek, love the neighbor, and help the needy to name a few idioms.  Creationism has been thrown out by most baptists, according to my preacher uncle.  Many churches think tax breaks for the rich are unchristian, though that has more economic impact than social.  Most churches and church goers view addiction as the mental illness it is and help addicts accordingly.  Socialism (usually within the church), people will collect money or tithe an extra few dollars to help someone who has suffered a catastrophe or someone in economic hardship, and most churches are the town's soup kitchen, shelter, and foodpantry.  It's really weird seeing Christians be socially liberal in odd ways.  Even my liberal friends have problems with addiction being a mental illness or donating time and money to the needy, yet it's so much the norm in our local churches that you get odd looks if you're against it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am currently in the Bible Belt.  You sound terribly misinformed about politics here.  A majority of politicians from here are social conservatives, but not in favor of institutionalized religion.  Some Christian values line up with socially conservative values, but just as many don't.  Furthermore, the different sects of Christianity (baptist, evangelical, Pentecostal, etc) have different interpretations of the bible and have A mottled view of what parts of society are wrong and what isn't; and all of these, even the most bible-literal sects, pale in comparison to Sharia Law.  What's more, old-school republicans are in favor of smaller government above all else (do not intervene if the situation is able to order itself.). This key value runs in complete contrast of institutionalized religion.  No place on Earth, save North Korea, is anything like the hellholes where Sharia Law is state law. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the thing. You said A primordial God is an elder God.

Is it in the same godly realm?  Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a chaos magician who studies gods, I am telling you, specifically, in magic, no one calls primordial gods elder gods. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying "antediluvian gods " you're referring to the godly grouping of Pre-history Goss, which includes things from forgotten gods to nature gods to   Primal gods.

So your reasoning for calling a primordial God Ann elder God is because random people "call the older ones Elder?" Let's get fairies and demons in there too.

Also, calling someone a magician or a wizard? It's not one or the other, that's not how magic works. They're both. A primordial God is a primordial God and a member of the beings who existed before the universe. But that's not what you said. You said a primordial God is an elder God, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the higher echelons of gods Elder Gods, which means you'd call primal gods and nature gods, and other God Elder God too. Which you said you don't.

It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's put forth two scenarios.

Scenario 1: an aware Jedi is getting shot at by a blaster bolt

Scenario 2: an aware Jedi is getting a punch thrown at his face.

First you have to look at the danger in both scenarios.  Scenario 1 has a lot more danger for the Jedi than scenario 2.  This danger will make a bigger and brighter impact on the the force.

Next let's look at the opponent.  A lot of people can be on the opposite end of scenario one; a droid, a soldier, or a slave could all pick up a blaster and make an attempt at the Jedi.  But for scenario 2, the only people you'd find throwing a punch is another force user or extremely well trained fighter.  For the other force user, he has his own physical augmentations and training to counter the precog (and actual counter-pre-cog for some) and while the highly trained person doesn't have the force, the Jedi is still a person who has to react.  If Tyson can throw 20 punched in a few seconds, some of them are going to hit.  And only Tyson-tier Melee fighters are going to go toe-to-toe with a Jedi.

Last, let's look at the outcome should the Jedi do nothing.  In scenario 2, the Jedi will get some broken teeth, a broken nose, and maybe end up on his back.  This would suck.  But for scenario 1, the Jedi's life could end.  These two different outcomes would look extremely different, with scenario 2 looking like a road sign and scenario 1 looking like a brightly light neon sign with flashlights neon letters and arrows around the sign, also flashing neon, pointing at it.

The force isn't true precognition, it's harder to read the more trivial the subject.

<TEXT> No, it's just an ugly language and its speakers have a bloody history.  The magic you saw was all Gandalf.  Gandalf is a Maiar of Manwe.  Manwe has power over the sky, air, winged creatures, speech, and will.  Gandalf, being an extension of Manwe, has the power of speech and will (and some minor stuff from other Ainur, Gandalf was a bit of a Mary-Sue as far as Maiar go).  To give an example, if I were to run out into my front yard and started screaming at the top of my lungs that I'm going to nuke Russia, I'd get weird looks and maybe the police called on me.  This is because I have little to no power.  Certainly not enough to nuke Russia.  Now imagine President Trump does the same.  He's in the middle of the White House lawn screaming about how he will nuke the Russians.  This has much more implication because Trump does have power, more than enough for his words to have an impact, whatever they are.

It's actually really cool when you view Gandalf's magic as his voice bending reality.  When he releases Theodin from thralldom, he just says "you are released" and it happens.  When facing down the Balrog, Gandalf was overpowered forcing the Balrog to not pass, so he told to bridge to not let him pass and the bridge listened and collapsed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> MO's initiative has, sadly, been a giant flop.  Broad sweeping rules were instated for nuanced problems.  My wife is a teacher, so these are second-hand examples: bake sales are off-limits during lunch, students have to raise money elsewhere; school lunch quality is at an all-time low and the number of students getting a school lunch has dropped to a fraction it was before Obama, the only students who get school lunch are the ones who get it free or reduced, and not all reduced kids get it it's so bad; serving size is down, it's not uncommon for a reduced or free school lunch kid to get theirs and give it to someone else to have double lunches, or a normal portion size for a poor kid who doesn't get to eat often outside of school; waste is at an all time high, many kids won't eat thrice frozen green beans and purple mush that was once probably blueberries and just throw them in the trash.  

The fat kids just bring their own lunches that are double the size of an entire school lunch.  It's done wonders to show the class divide in my wife's school as the wealthy kids eat deli style sandwiches and quart sized containers of soups while the poor kids eat peanut butter sandwiches from home or the salty-red-sauce covered cardboard from school. </TEXT>

It's cheaper to ship something across the ocean to America than to make it in America.  This hurts the American economy as a whole, despite being good for the corporation.  This is exactly what our government is supposed to do, protect its people.  Does America have a duty to protect human rights around the world?  No, I like that we do protect human rights but we by no means have to.  The SEA family can still find work without destroying American jobs and leaving me underemployed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> True, but Legolas is already a bullet timer in reaction time, and Geralt gets no prep in his fight against Legolas, and I doubt Legolas is going to let him cast any sort of spell or drink a potion in the middle of their fight.  Legolas and Gimli are the two members of the fellowship who don't aim to wound whatever they attack.  Any sort of bonus prep would afford Geralt would be useless when you add Aragorn, because Aragorn isn't a man, he's a Dunedane, part elven, and has his own slew of magical items that outclass Geralt's own.  I expect whatever sword Geralt is using to be bent or broken after clashing with Aragorn's own (Aragorn is above peak human in many attributes and abilities).  And while Geralt is faster than Aragorn, he's the same speed as Legolas with his potion, and Legolas is still very formidable in melee.  The two members of the fellowship beating down on Geralt would be too much.  He might wound one, maybe even fatally, but he won't win.  Also Aragorn can bring magical properties out of mundane plants thanks to the blessing of Yvanna, he would be able to heal any damage that isn't immediately fatal after Geralt dies.  And again, once you add Gimli, someone more skilled and wearing dwarf forged armor (dwarves make their items inherently magic as well). Geralt's chances become slim-to-none.  With Boromir, a "man" who was able to cleave through most of a mountain troll's arm in a single swing (middle earth men =\= men) it just becomes a slaughter. </TEXT>

First we have to establish that man =\= The Race of Men

The only round that isn't 9 or 10 out of 10 for Geralt losing is round one, and you put him against the strongest fighter in the fellowship.  Some of Legolas's feats include running on fresh snow without leaving a footprint;hitting a warg between its shoulder bone and thick neck fat, a space less than an inch across, from several hundred yards away; and the whole Elephant scene in Rotk.  I haven't watched the Hobbit to get more feats from there.  Then you have to realize that almost everything Legolas uses is magical.  The elven process of crafting imparts a part of their soul into everything they make, making all his gear supernaturally better than it would be if made by a man.  But then you have his quiver that allows him to grab any specific arrow naturally, his bow which is an old bow of royalty, and his cloak that hides him from all enemies.  I'd give this match up a 3/10 for Geralt.  But every round after this is a 0/10.  Aragorn isn't a fighter, he's a ranger, and is the worst off in a straight fight out of everyone save a Hobbit.  But Aragorn and Legolas fought multiple battles together and can work in a team flawlessly.  Once you add Gimli the fight is over in seconds.   </TEXT>

I want Gohan to admit that a deep desire to NOT be like Goku is what made him stop training.  Then I want Goku to say it plane as day: he isn't human.  He doesn't feel the connection everyone talks about, he doesn't dwell on anything that isn't food or fighting because he physically can't do anything but dwell on the next time he fights or eats food.

I can't think of any feats before that that would put him past Cell, but he wasn't even THAT far behind the saiyans during the Cell Games.  He put up a good fight against Cell, Cell Jr, and even Broly (best moment of the movie is when Goku and Piccolo are double teaming Broly and there's just slapping noises as Broly moves his body around).

In the Android Saga, Yamcha was as strong as base Goku at the end of the Frieza saga.  Krillin is above Yamcha, but not by enough to matter for this logic train.  This puts Krillin stronger than third form Frieza and base Goku at the end of the saga, putting Krillin's power level above 3,000,000.

 In contrast, Vegeta During the Saiyan saga has a base power level of 18,000 and 180,000 in great ape form.  Krillin would destroy Vegeta.  Krillin would still destroy Vegeta at the end of the Namek saga who only was still weaker than Goku. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yu Gi Oh is heavily based off an ancient game played by sorcerers and other magic users who were able to bend reality and able to pit real monsters against each other.  On top of summoning real monsters, the Wizards would use their own magic to further influence the battle (magic cards), use curses to set traps for what their opponent and their monsters would do(trap cards) and employ further magical tricks that were evolving often to stay on top of the game.  The loser, having expanded all their power and life energy, would be dragged to void realm by the very monsters and powers they employed in their Faustian dealings.  

Of course we all know this is simple mythology and we have no idea how the rule of Pharaoh Yami ended or where he is buried.  The modern day card game is just a silly game like Monopoly is to real-estate and checkers is to battlefield tactics.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes he could have.  Maiar (and Ainur and elves) must put a piece of themselves into anything they create, from rings, to children, to boats.  Theoretically, Sauron could spread the power distribution out over several rings of power that, when all worn at once, do the same thing as the ring does.  But he didn't do that.  And while we don't k ow exactly why he didn't do that, we could guess that it would require more of himself if spaced over 8 rings rather than one, leaving him weaker than if he simply made one, or perhaps he didn't want to risk losing one of the 8 rings of power set he made (as he did with the dwarf rings and some of the men rings.).  Sauron was a Maiar of Aule, The Crafter.  What ever reason Sauron had for pooling his power into one ring rather than many are most likely very practical and logical, not born from hubris. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, mostly.  In D D most places have laws against the things the orcs/goblins/kobolds do and, as a result, these groups are considered outlaws, meaning the laws of society don't apply to them.  So you can enslave goblin women for your perverted needs, butcher entire Orc families, and even make kobold tail hubcaps for your wagon.  This doesn't make you any less of a dick, though.  In fact, this is where then infamous alignment system shows it's worth.  You can rape and pillage lawfully, but that still makes you, at least, not good.  So if a neutral good sorcerer decided he wants kobold slaves, I wouldn't make him chaotic good, I'd make him true neutral as he isn't break any laws, just morals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is this real?  Goku pulls punches so the shockwave doesn't destroy entire star system.  His fight with Beerus almost destroyed the universe.  Goku is the pinnacle of physical strength in fiction, only reality warpers or OnePunchMen can hope to beat him and they still have to contend with a Goku can casually hops dimensions and moves faster than light. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're clearly made this vs with a bias for one over the other.  In the the recent DBZ super episode, Goku literally beat a dimension-hopping, time-stopping assassin.  Goku would move faster than DIO could think to stop time.  If drawn into another universe, Goku can just IT out.  It's well established that only supreme, universe-level hax can beat Goku and DIO just isn't packing that kind of power. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is my long-winded explanation for Myers-Briggs tests: It's not scientific fact, more akin to lines drawn in the sand that then got washed over in the high-tide.  It's fun but so is masturbating and I wouldn't put much professional or personal stock in either of those things.  It can tell you more about yourself if you're extremely unaware about yourself but the problem is you're answering your own questions so yeah you're more likely to get a bias.  I've taken it several times over the years and always got ENTJ.  I'm extroverted, that's obvious; I'm fairly intuitive in my work and home, constantly coming up with small inefficiencies to correct entirely on my own;  I'm good at coming up with my own plans and schedules that are very good coupled with my N; and I'm a judgments bitch.  Girl you don't even know, mmhmm.

The fight scene is beautiful itself but it has so much: Roshi blowing up the moon, Goku first us my the Kamehameha, and Roshi beating Goku, the clearly stronger fighter, by using his brains over brawn, which Goku still falls for to this day.

<TEXT> I was on welfare for six months.  When my newborn son was 3 months old I was lucky enough to get laid off, leaving us with only my wife's income (brand new school teachers don't make much above minimum wage!). So we applied and were accepted, we got hundreds of dollars worth of food stamps and over a hundred dollars in baby supplies (formula and diapers all paid for) and any job I took would have ended up costing us money because our benefits came out to almost 600 a month.  But I didn't want to live like that, got a new job (new career, actually) and haven't been on welfare in over 2 years.  But it was hard and I can see where some people would just kick back, suckle the government tit and not get a job because: I really enjoyed the time I got to spend with my son when he was developing a personality and becoming a person.  But I couldn't live with myself taking and not giving.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not hard to do without realizing when you have HAES blinders on.  Say you drink a soda with all three meals a day instead of water, that's an extra 375from liquids.  Add two more as snacks and that 625 from liquids.  Now you up your desserts to twice a day, daily, which adds 250 calories a day.  Now you cut out exorcise, 175 calories a day.  Let's add a bran muffin to our breakfast, 350.  We're up to 1300 calories and haven't even touched the HAES habit of grazing yet.  ~11 lays potatoe chips give you 120 calories, and I doubt most people would eat just eleven when they have delicious soda to wash it down.  Let's say she eats 33, that's 360 more calories.  At dinner, she gets rid of asparagus and makes mashed potatoes because their a vegetable too, right?  Serving size is a cup, she eats two, that's an extra 420 calories (210 per serving).  I forgot second snack between lunch and dinner.  We're up to 2080 extra calories, but we prefer something sweeter as the day goes on.  She eats a pop tart.  There is the 400 calories were looking for.  10 more calories from the grapes she ate to be healthy.  2500 calories. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would keep all of them at the price they currently are.  The point of these gold sinks, especially the talent respeccing cost, is to, essentially, tax the hardcore players who are wiping in raids and respeccing throughout the week.  By reducing the large sums of gold these players would normally have, and by making them farm to get gold, you are keeping gold reserves down and keeping mats in the AH priced lower as supply keeps up or out-paces demand.  This lets the casual player, who doesn't have alts with maxed professions, able to afford things from the AH and continue their casual existence.

Retail has players with max gold because they removed all the gold-sinks hardcore players have to endure to be hardcore players, muscling out casual players and leading to rapid inflation in the AH.  Fresh players, starting wow for the first time, will be greeted with 10g+ level 7 greens in the AH, and the price only goes up from there (and Light help you if it transmogs into something cool). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Elves ages, but they age differently than humans, dwarves, and hobbits.  Elves, like Maiar and Ainur, put a piece of themselves into everything they create.  Children, boats, priceless jewels, all of these take a part of the elf who created them.  Regardless of how much of himself an elf has spent, he does not physically look older.  However, if an elf puts too much of themselves into their creations, their body will go to sleep and die, letting their spirit pass into the halls of waiting.  We see this happen with Faenor's mother after giving birth to him. </TEXT>

His sword is magic after Elrond reforged it as most elven creations have a bit of magic imbued in them through the crafting process.  So Aragorn would roll over the human settlements but hit mirkwood and suddenly his ghosts are getting mowed down because they are used to just charging and that goes terrible against a wall of arrows </TEXT>

<TEXT> The ring gives power. It enhances power and gives the user the power to dominate wills.  On Gandalf this would be most disastrous as he already has the power of voice and spirit from his patron Ainur Manwe.  The ring also, as you sad, commands the ringwraiths (Tolkien wrote in a letter that the reason Sauron didn't send the nazgul to Mt. Doom is because, being so close to the source, Frodo would be able to command them to stop.). It doesn't make you invisible so much as fade you into the shadowland, having you exist in two realms at once.  Frodo turned invisible because he was spiritually weak.  Aragorn or Gandalf would have remained visible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> MINING

Copper ore farming is best in Elwynn Forest if you follow along the ridge below the East-West road, circling around the log camp and following the mountains all the way past stormwind and around Westbrook Garrison.  Durotar is good as well, just make a big circle around the edge.

Tin ore easy pickings in Alterac Vally (the zone).  Just circle around the outside of the mountains.  A good alternative is the northern part of STV, focusing on mountainous ridges.

Iron Ore is best farmed in Feralas, again making a big circle around the edge of the zone, focusing on the mountain ridges.  A decent alternative is Tenaris, though you wont find much out in the sand.

Mithril can only really be farmed in the burning steppes.  Sorry hordies.   Make a big circle around the edges, do not go into the pits as you will aggro constantly.  Much easier to circle around the outside.  If hordies don't want to walk, Felwood is an okay alternative, though not nearly as good.

Thorium is in Silithus and Winterspring, around the outsides.  Do not go into the bug hives or caves, they are packed with mobs and not worth it.

Happy farming!  Remember that everything respawns after server resets! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fair enough on the ring's cursed nature.  However, it's implied Arqgorn could master the ring, as he was able to master the Palantir and Sauron feared he had mastered the ring.  Even Frodo, with his untrained mind, had partially mastered the ring as Tolkien himself wrote in his letters, as to why the ringwraiths weren't sent to mount doom, is that they would have froze up, Sauron and Frodo's commands canceling each other out (though Frodo only held such power with the ring due to possessing it and being so close to its source.  If Sauron were closer and able to fully focus the ringwraiths would have obeyed him.). I think Dumbledore has more than enough power to master the ring more than it would master him.  However, the ring would still corrupt him, as it does all things.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was thinking about him the other day, it's weird when an NPC in a video game has such a profound influence on you that you find yourself thinking about him, his situation, his thoughts.  He's crazy, you can tell that the first time you meet him and he never proves that assumption wrong.  But how crazy is he?  He treats the headcrabs as his flock, he can leave at any time and chooses not to.  But one of his random lines struck me: when he says "I remember your true face" when killing one of the infected.  The line is delivered with his usual proselytizing tone but there's a definite undertone of sadness in his voice.  He knows these people are gone, he knows he can't help them by how freely he kills them.  Why does he stay?  Did he have family he can't leave behind despite them being infected?  Does he know how the world is doing outside Ravenholm?  I hope he one day finds peace, and that's a weird feeling to have for someone who doesn't exist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure.  The guy who kills an end-bringer in a straight fight is someone named Scion, he's very important but I won't get into that.  He has powers above and beyond every other hero in the series.  Imagine if DC only had street level heroes, this guy is superman to them, just completely out of their league in every way.  While Scion is hands down the most powerful thing on earth, he's incredibly aloof; while a hurricane  hits Cuba, he's evacuating a school fire in Australia, while an endbringer attacks Seoul, he's saving a cat from a tree in California.  Scion doesn't eat, sleep, or stop being a hero ever.  He also doesn't really talk or communicate with anyone, most people thing he's extremely autistic or something.  At a point in the series, Scion gets it in his head to kill an endbringer instead of driving it off.  Scion grabs the endbringer, completely immune to its attacks, and bathes it in a hard light beam repeatedly until it disintegrated to nothing.  The protagonist gets to see it in person as scion slowly cooks through the Endbringer's layers until it's ash.  Later on in the series, SPOILER Scion is also seen to casually destroy Europe, for funsies (no really, he does it for funsies).  And shows himself capable of casually going through any other heroe's defenses with his hard light attack.  So while we don't know how durable and endbringer is exactly (besides the vague statement by the author that their core is as dense as a whole galaxy) we do know that the power that killed one is at least continent busting.  And it took a continent-busting-energy bath to kill one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People aren't quite getting Endbringer's durability right.  An endbringer has layers like an onion (or ogre).  Endbringers also exist in an infinite amount of alternative dimensions.  As you move down layers, more of the damage inflicted upon the endbringer is shunted off into more and more alternate dimension endbringers until you reach the core.  At the core, damage is shunted off into an infinite number of dimensions, making any damage done effectively zero.  The damage is an asymptote, as a hero is able to dish out enough damage to eventually kill one, but we're talking several minutes of constant at-least Earth-busting power.  The guy who kills the end bringer is a casual continent buster who only tries once in the entire series, when he kills the endbringer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hera was seen as the goddess of children, women, and childbirth.  But like the other god's children, I think her children would take on more nuanced powers from her.  Some powers I think would manifest: 

Curse with bad luck, the person is extremely unlucky until the curse is lifted, which only Hera and her children can do ( Hera's curses were notoriously unable to be removed but by her)

Curse as ware-animal, self explanatory, same as above, curse someone to turn into an animal during the full moon.

Attract/repel the opposite sex, self explanatory, could be used in self or others.

Godly command, Hera was the queen of gods, after all.  And Hera is the feminine version of the Greek word Heron, or Master.  This would let someone given simple commands that people follow, could be resisted by will power.

If the series was more gritty you could get into truly horrid curses like induce hysterical pregnancy or cause birthing pain, but that's a little much. </TEXT>

Majin-boo, Bibidi, and Piccolo are the three strongest magic users you'll find in DBZ.  Going further into Piccolo, he was actually a member of the Dragon Clan of Namekians who had a long history of being very powerful magic users.  King Piccolo, and by extension current Piccolo, were the most powerful magic users in the Dragon Clan, able to make dragon balls and shoot clothes beams.  Cell is 1/3 Piccolo and likely inherited enough of the Dragon Clan's inherent magic abilities to make the Cell tournament arena.

Fafnir appears in the normal endbringer cycle in place of a normal trigger.  Instead of triggering like normal, the person is slowly consumed by the shard(s) controlling Fafnir and transform into a monster vaguely resembling a dragon with Lung's power set but with a much faster escalation.  As legend said in the fanfic "This endbringer has taken more than any other--our trust in each other.

<TEXT> Not quite true.  Endbringers are like onions (and ogres) in that they have layers.  The surface layer is extremely durable flesh.  The layer below that is the same flesh but any damage done to that later is split between the same flesh that exists in 10 other dimensions, so attacks are 90% less effective on the second layer.  The third layer adds a magnitude more dimensional displacement.  The fourth layer adds another magnitude of dimensional displacement.  So in and so forth until the encore of the endbringers is displacing damage out to an infinite number of dimensions, reducing all damage to effectively zero.

<TEXT> Round one, yellow is mostly the US.  SA and Africa have a lot of people but lacks a modern, powerful military to compete against the US.  That said, the US is capable of stale mating the whole world by itself and only benefit from having any allies, regardless of their force projection.  

The US will own the oceans, hands down.  Not only do we have a larger navy than everyone else combined, we can spit out more faster. 

Some of the major militaries the US will be up against are:

Australia: Almost all of Australia's population is on the coast.  With that in mind, Australia will be very quickly decimated as the US's navy bombards every large populated city and sizable military base in Australia.  Every plane will be downed, every boat will be sunk, every hope of mobilizing anything beyond gorilla fishing boats will be destroyed.  People will evacuate to the bush but will be too focused on surviving to do anything.  Sorry, Aussies.  You chose the wrong side.

Japan will go much the same way as Australia thanks to their similar layout.  It will go much faster due to Japan's lack of military, though their paramilitary police will be difficult.  Still, with the US's navy circling the islands uncontested, Japan is, like Australia, crippled to the point of being harmless outside of its islands.  China will be trouble and likely try to attack while we deal with Japan.  China has a massive Army but their navy and air force are both smaller and less advanced than the US's.  The US will keep the Chinese penned inland.

the UK is another replay of Japan, with the EU countries playing the role of China just same, penned in and everything.

Mainland Eurasia is where the US forces stop steam rolling the rest of the world and their air/sea superiority becomes less of an "I Win" card.  Unfortunately for mainland Eurasia, most of their major cities are by oceans and seas.  Some areas of interest:

Southern Europe will be ran over so fast they'll call it The Blitz 2: electric bungaloo.  The US forces are already across the Mediterranean, once the US navy come knocking it won't look pretty.  There will be intense air battles all over Souther Europe, due to almost all EU members having decently sized and very modern air forces.  Unfortunately the US most likely made them and have the modern version of whatever the EU is fielding.  As well, countries like Germany and Switzerland, who could slow down the US Air Force, are in perfect position to be attacked from the north and south, splitting their already small airforces in two.  As for the land-segment of the war, the US has two very large sources of expendable soldiers, SA and Africa.  Without these two, the US forces would have no hope of taking any mainland Eurasia more than a few miles inland.

China will be a lot of flat land with a lot of troops.  Air superiority here will be easier to get and more effective thanks to the flat planes.  But the sheer size of the Chinese military is going to be a hurdle that will be hard to jump.  More so than anywhere else, overcoming China will be the hardest and most likely area to bring down the US forces.

Russia has been waiting for this moment since 1992.  Unfortunately, Russia just isn't prepared for it.  Unlike all of those who failed to invade Russia, the US and Canadian forces are very prepared for Russian winters.  Since most of Russia is in the Western side, the US will most likely attack through Scandinavia (which is a whole other thing but still horrible one-sides.). The Canadians are a force to be reckoned with and are used to the cold, as are most of the US forces thanks to a few large training bases being in the north (looking at you, Grand Rapids.  My friend from southern Texas sure enjoyed your -30f wind chill). Russia should take solace in the fact that they will tie up the most US forces since their military is very good and SA and African troops just wouldn't handle the cold as well.


The Middle East is pretty boring once Turkey is defeated.  And they will be defeated.  I honestly think, with the US at war with Geneva, they will use chemical weapons right back once they're used on the US forces.  And they will be.  Fighting here will be the most horrific with so many powers able to deploy chemical weapons and dirty bombs literally tomorrow.

I give it US forces 6.5/10.  The worst that can happen is a stalemate with the US forces unable to penetrate into Eurasia.  But the US will not lose.

For round two, things look a lot better for the US forces.  The yellow side has a clear power hierarchy in that the US will be calling the shots.  This will give the US time to train and arm the SA and African allies thoroughly in the five years leading up to the war.  The other side has too many powers.  The EU will want to boss China will want to boss Russia, will want to boss the EU, etc.  and the Middle East hates everyone.  Even with five years, the US will have a lead on arming up their side before everyone else makes a deal.  IF they make a deal.  US forces 8/10 </TEXT>

It's just a small, tiny chance you'll die that day.  My grandfather and uncle have if.  My uncle is still alive and in his late 50s. </TEXT>

That said, a lot of the magic will manifest in ways that attack superman mentally and physically, very few attack chakra or use magic hax.  While Naruto and Sasuke can do some of the magic hax, theyre both too straightforward to try that before superman decimates them after no-selling both of their strongest attacks.

<TEXT> To understand how Gandalf and the Balrog fought, you have to understand Maiar's inherent nature.  Maiar are aspects of their patron, sort of like quasi-lesser deities overseeing aspects of their patron deities.  Gandalf was a Maiar of Manwe, who oversaw the powers (gross simplification) of voice, will, air, and Avians.  Gandalf seemed to mostly am body the spirit and voice aspects.  The Balrog was a Maiar of Morgoth, and he embodied shadow and fire.   Now understand that both of these entities are naturally bodiless and take physical form simply to interact with elves, men, orcs, etc.  

Most of the fight between Gandalf and the Balrog was non-physical.  For instance, when Gandalf said "you shall not pass."  It was his voice commanding the Balrog and the whole of reality to keep the Balrog from passing the bridge.  This is why the Balrog looks angry and seems to have trouble advancing on the bridge.  And when he does advance, the bridge obeys Gandalf and keeps the Balrog from passing.  The Balrog is attacking Gandalf with shadow and attacking him physically with his whip of fire.  In many depictions of Gandalf and the Balrog before the  the movie, you see Gandalf surrounded by shadow and standing against it.  We never saw the full battle between Gandalf and the Balrog, but it most likely looked very much like the confrontation on the bridge: mostly non-physical and the battle taking place through the fabric of reality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Doylist:

When translating verses and epic poems, the translator will try to translate the original meaning as best they can and the original cadence and phonetic tools as best they can.  Take Beowulf.  If you were to pick up most translations, you would find alliteration, rhyming, couplets, etc, that would not be there if it was a direct translation (which I've read and it flows so horribly it's like reading it upside down).  But most translations, including Tolkien's own translation of Beowulf, found a balance between direct word meaning and sentence flow.  Keeping that in mind, when Tolkien was translating the Red Book of Westmarch, he most likely did what any translator would do and tried to preserve the syntax as well as the original meaning. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Episode 1: Smoaky and the bandit.
 Kite-Man (played by Danny DeVito) is a new thief in town.  Tensions run high between Felicity and Oliver as Kite-Man steals more than her engagement ring--but also Felicity's heart.

Episode 2: Where There's Smoak There's Fire
Felicity leads both Oliver and Kite-man on as she can't choose between the two, but after jealousy leads to blows between the two suitors (Oliver loses) they end up having a threesome.

Episode 3: Up in Smoak
Kite-man has an aneurism post coitus (after a gruelingly long opening sex scene) and goes into a coma.  Felicity goes to the gynecologist and finds out she's pregnant, and has cancer with slim odds of survival.

Episode 4: Smoak It Up
Felicity gets medical marijuana and hallucinates about being a super hero.  After her bad trip she can walk again thanks to medical marijuana curing her paralyzed legs.

Episode 5: Smoak on the Water 
I drowned myself after watching the first four episodes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as tinkers go, Syndrome is fairly high up there.  If I had to give him a number and a specialization, I would say he is a Tinker 7 with a speciality in hero mimicking, putting him at a Trump 4 as well.  Every piece of technology he has on his person is a knock off of another hero: flight, bombs, freeze ray, etc.  In the worm-verse, with more hero and villain powers to duplicate, Syndrome would be a powerful force to be reckoned with, more than earning his Tinker 7, Trump 4 rating.  Syndrome would most likely run a mid sized city or, more likely due to his ego, run a dominant gang in a large city.  He would run the large city due to his tactical knowledge but his ego would cause him to seek out the protectorate for a fight.  I could even see him being Eidolon's nemesis in Houston, with Syndrome going up against him with a slew of copied powers every other week and Eidolon having to switch his own powers on the fly to counter.  Being the rival of the strongest cape in the world might even be good for Syndrome and his massive inferiority complex to the point of his and Eidolon's relationship cooling over to the point of resembling Doom and Reed's relationship but without the history (so less trust).

So to answer your question, he would make a good Rival for Eidolon, and would toe the line between A-class and S-class, only staying in the former due to him focusing on picking fights with the protectorate rather than mass murdering civilians.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bisexuality is an extension of the binary sexualities of homosexuality and heterosexuality.  Pan sexuality is a broader term with subsections like gynosexuality(attraction to feminine body types, women, traps, cross dressers, lithe men, etc) and androsexuality (attraction to masculine body types, men, bull dykes, cross dressers, body-building women, etc) as well as the usual homo and heterosexualities thrown in there.  Most people have more than one sexual preference when you get into what they like.  The woman up higher who is heterosexual and gynosexual, likes penis and women's bodies but not vagina; the guy up higher who likes traps and women, and laments not finding one who wants to use a strap on, also hetero and gynosexual.  Liking dick in your ass doesn't change your sexual preference  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of two things could be happening when Anakin runs into Palpatine's chambers.  1: The scene looks just like the movie but on the ground lies a dead/dying Obi Wan.  2: on the ground lies several dead masters and a dead Palpatine, with a victorious Obi Wan and Windu over the corpse.  In both scenarios, Anakin would not attack the Jedi, but in the first scenario, while he and Windu easily defeat the emperor, Anakin goes far too deep into the dark side when killing the man that killed Obi Wan.  He will blame the Jedi for his dead for some reason and keep digging into the teachings of the Sith.  Without an Obi Wan to temper him he will, without a doubt, fall.  Interestingly enough, he will most likely join the council and attain the title master after the fact in both scenarios thanks to killing a powerful Sith Lord and all the seats that just opened up. </TEXT>

Similarly, when it's cold, have fire benders heat the water until it's steaming hot. Plumbing would be simple as well, let the brown water drain out.  Now I can see water benders doing one of two things: pushing the poop water waaaay out into the ocean, or evaporate all the water, leaving behind foul sand-like waste to be buried by the earth benders (can they bend it now?  It's mostly minerals with all the liquid gone.)  with LoK's large pro-environment world, I imagine something like the second one would be more likely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your first mistake was assuming DOCTOR DOOM was a bad guy at all.  Has he done morally reprehensible things in the eyes of many?  Yes.  But has he ever done harm for harms sake?  Has he ever acted out of malice and hatred?  While I admit he has enacted revenge in the past, revenge was simply a satisfying byproduct in the grand scheme of DOOM.  DOCTOR DOOM is a hero and never forget it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This, sadly, boils down to semantics.  It is said that Faenor is "the mightiest of all elves" but it is also said  that Fingolfin is "unmatched in physical combat."  I would give the match to Fingolfin for two reasons.  The first, the only feat that Faenor has on Fongolfin is him vs the Balrogs.  At this time, the Balrogs were standing between Faenor and his silmarils, making him Silmaril-lusted.  Fingolfin, on the other hand, is consistently in combat and comes out unscathed.  When Fingolfin fights Morgoth, it isn't a outlier feat like with Faenor and the Balrogs.

Second, the Morgoth feat puts Fongolfin's fighting ability as the fourth strongest being on middle earth ever.  It goes Tulkas, Morgoth, and fingolfin ties Manwe, as it is said Morgoth is stronger than him even when trapped in his human form.  This makes Fingolfin stronger than Orome in physical combat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Brock is a much better trainer than Ash in all aspects but one (will touch on that).  Brock would train Charmander at a pace he and Charmander were comfortable with.  He would also show Charmander an unconditional love and not use him nearly as much as Ash did.  This would cause Charmander to evolve slower than he did in the OT.  But, given time, Charmander would still evolve into his final form of Charizard though most likely not until after the Indigo league.  Charizard also wouldn't have learned to push himself as hard as he did with as and would not likely become powerful enough to go toe-to-toe with legendaries.  I think the other Pokemon would pick up the slack with no Charizard but what your left with is a very powerful Pokemon that Brock never uses because he's too sporting to utterly dominate any Pokemon battle.  But you'll know shit got real when he does send Charizard out.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unlike current demon hunters, Illidan's transformation took place in stages.  The first stage of his transformation was back during the War of the Ancients.  Illidan's was trying to play double agent and did something to Sargeras's benefit.  For his service, and sensing great magic and potential, Sargeras himself granted Illidan his magic sight and adorned his body with the fel tattoos, marking him as Sargeras's agent (many believe Sargeras also sensed his treachery and marked him for that as well). With his new power and abilities he fought and killed a pit lord named Azinoth and took his twin blades for himself.  Marked as a servant of Sargeras everyone mistrusted him.  Luckily his brother and best friend were the duel leaders of the night elf people following the sundering so, even after recreating the Nightwell, he was only imprisoned instead of killed.  

At the time of his imprisonment, it's arguable he was already a demonhunter.  He has the tattoos, the magic sight, the magic and martial ability, and he has the title Betrayer.  But it isn't until he absorbs the skull of Gul'dan that he takes on his current appearance and gains his immense power.  Thanks to Sargeras's fel infusion from before, the mass amount of fel energy turned him into a half-demon-thing and tied his soul to the twisting nether.  It's at this point we get Illidan who begins to train the Illidari after the events of WCIII. He's so demonic that Tyrande, his childhood friend, and his own brother hardly recognize him.  He is exiled.  After his exile is when Illidan forms the Illidari (a.k.a Azerothian Super Friend).  </TEXT>

Surely you don't believe that, every few hundred years, one being, who's race and gender change depending on the story teller, comes into great physical and magical power as well as leads one or more guilds, and then vanishes from memory?  If the story of how Emperor Martin fought and banished a Deadra Lord with the help of a ever-changing partner who is a male Nord in Bruma and a female Argonian in Leyawiin is of no concern than worrying about where the South gate lets out relative to Bravil isn't much worry.  Focus on the moral of the legends. </TEXT>

Tolkien was a brilliant man with many interests.  He was also deeply saddened at the loss of culture of the Anglo-Saxons.  He even lamented the story of King Arthur being so romanticized to the point of the original name being in French ( La Muerte De Arturo) I think it's very fitting that Tolkien manages to revive so much Anglo-Saxon-esque mythology and make it so prevalent today. </TEXT>

We went together and got home super late.  And I decided to stay the night on her couch.  Nothing happened that night.  The next day was also spent with her but things were much more flirty.  I spent the night again but not on the couch.

We're married now, have two kids.  We just tell people we met while she was teaching at my school but we met the year after I graduated.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yoda foresaw this battle decades in advance during  his meditations.  Yoda will drag out the battle, challenging Deathstroke's morals as the two fight into a stalemate.  Eventually, when Deathstroke begins to question his way of life and his focus wanes, Yoda lowers his guard and takes a fatal hit, killing him instantly.  But the encounter has left an imprint on the bounty hunter.  He meditates on the encounter and is visited by none other than Yoda's force ghost.  Through mental, physical, and spiritual training, Slade Wilson becomes a grey Jedi master.

But really though, Yoda's feats are second to only Palps and not by much.  He nearly won their encounter.  Deathstroke physically outclasses Yoda but would lose the mental game fast between Yoda bettering himself (precog, force enhancement) and hindering Wade(mental clouding, frying his electronics).  If Wade doesn't get Yoda down fast, the geriatric will fight a fight of attrition and quickly gain the upper hand. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Partly true, but the magic Gandalf could do would have been an extension of his Patron ainur, Manwe, would be able to do.  Manwe was the lord of the skies and air, and the master of authority.  You see this in the battle with the Balrog where Gandalf commands him to not pass.  The world bends around his will to make his command so, the Balrog dos not pass.  Saruman, on the other hand, serves Aule, the crafter.  With his magic, he is able to create a new, stronger breed of Orc.  

During their fight, they were simply throwing raw, weak magic at the other.  It's on their specialties that a Maiar really shines. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The current alignment system has evolved to include inherently good and evil things, but the 1/2e systems were closer to height and skin color as far as characterization goes.  With that in mind, I am saying the whole alignment system as a strict set of morals able to characterize entire people on are inherently flawed.  The batman chart is a good example. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem with this is the alignment system was originally thought up as a fluid system that most characters self identify as.  For instance, both Captain America and Punisher would call themselves lawful good.  For every argument that crops up for defining each sector of the the 9x9 char, another refutes it.  Captain America can't me LG because he gives too much mercy, mercy is the opposite of lawful.  Darth Sidious isn't evil because he was unifying the galaxy for the greater good--like ripping off a bandaid, it was necessary.  The alignment system has no defining character because people change, and the lines between assignment change, or at least aren't straight and possibly take up 4 dimensions.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes they did go over a bump, and this did cause poor Marvin to get shot in the face.  The reason why this happened is because, when they went over the bump, Vincent had his hand holding the gun while resting it on the back of his seat.  When his balance was suddenly shifted, he tensed and tried to brace against the seat, his finger (which should NOT have been resting on the trigger) squeezed to grip the backseat and pulled the trigger instead of grabbing the seat.

<TEXT> To understand what the good doctor meant, you have to understand Loki's relationship with the other gods.  Loki's role was to humiliate the other gods in order to remind them of humility.  This job could be anything from cutting off all of Sif's hair to birthing the wolf Fenrir and then getting it to bite off Tyr's hand.  This job was important to the gods as humility was easy to lose when you are worshipped and deified.  Now, from a Christian outlook of black and white, Loki would look evil.  I mean, he did a lot of dickish things and would bring about ragnorok.  So it is easy to see that, when you go around looking at other religions with the notion of good vs evil (a bad idea in Nordic myths as everyone is a dick) the guy who is going to end the world is the one who you call evil. </TEXT>

So you're in this for the long haul.  People aren't normally asexual.  Find out if your wife is not attracted to you or not attracted to anyone.  If your physically the problem then /r/fit .  If she finds no one attractive then that sounds like a hormone imbalance or a mental block.  Have her get her hormones tested after she's done breastfeeding and is a year post-birth. ( that's when things go back to normal, I don't envy women of that).  If her hormones are normal then couples therapy time.  If she won't go to therapy, flesh lights are cheap on Amazon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Best answer is... Maybe?  On one hand, her hormones are just screaming "fuck you" with everything they have at her, swinging her emotions around like a rag doll and make her physically miserable.  Expect her hormones to normalize around a year after she gives birth.

On the other hand, modern medicine has no idea why my bedroom has stayed dead for almost three years after my wife gave birth.  I got an eye roll when I suggest a handjob on Father's Day.

Jokes on her, I find resting bitch face attractive (or maybe that's the only response I get to my advances and my brain is subconsciously as starved for physical affection as my conscious.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as power, Frostmourn is ahead of any other weapon in Azeroth.  It turned Arthas into a death knight, made him considerably stronger, and corrupted him absolutely.  Frostmourn grants casts amount of power.  

The Ashbringer, on the other hand, enhances power.  It works with the power out into it.  Sure, it turned thousands of undead into ash in one swing, but that was with the power of the hundreds of dead Paladins under Light's Hope and a very strong paladin wielding it.  The Ashbringer is not as strong as Frostmourn.

However, it did break it.  Imagine Frostmourne is superman.  You can chuck hundreds of thousands of different kinds of rocks at him and it wouldn't faze him.  Imagine the Ashbringer is kryptonite and you pelt superman in the face with it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm in a similar situation as you but with the genders flipped.  We can't have sex unless I'm freshly showered, freshly shaved, my hair doesn't look bad, I just brushed my teeth and haven't eaten anything since, and if I don't give oral she acts disappointed in a shameful sort of way.  God forbid if I try to touch her breasts too.  But hey, I'm lucky to be getting sex, right?

Honestly, I think your partner just views sex as a way for him to feel pleasure with no regard for yours.  It would take a lot of counseling and a big change in ideology to even start changing that point of view.  You could cut off the sex entirely but then no one wins.  Does his selfish behavior happen outside the bedroom?  It's subtle in my relationship but it bleeds over there to.

Break if you feel like you've run out of options, but make sure you detail out to him what caused the break.  Write a letter to get it all down that way you want it.

Good luck.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> While things like Super Sayan and the Genkai boost are inherent for his species, Goku ( and Vageta) is a prodigy.  Goku constantly unlocked techniques and pushed himself beyond the limits of any Sayan or being in his Galaxy.  He also accented to godhood with the SSG transformation.

The closest comparison I can think of is Thor.  Asgardians are naturally powerful, but Thor is absurdly strong even among Asgardians before you add in his divine power.  Then he gets the Odenforce (SSG) and is universe-tier.  

Of course, unlike Thor, Goku is going full Saitama where he doesn't seem to have a ceiling.  So we will see where it ends.  </TEXT>

And he was only initially controlling the orcs to go after the Draenei, whom landed on the Orc homeworld fleeing from KJ and his counterpart Archinonde( who is more of a so-it-yourselfer than KJ) who started out as Draenei (then called Erador, Draenei means exiled in draenish[which should be eradish]) and have a hard on for genociding their own race.  KJ left Draenor, the Orc planet named after the race not from there for some reason, alone after the Draenei left Draenor (wtf Draenei, how many planets will you leave as lambs to the slaughter because you won't face your former people) and Gul'dan went full crazy.  So in game lore, Gul'dan is acting on his own for most of the first game.  Sargeras is possessing Medivh but I don't think Gul'dan knows that.

Edit: also old gods.  Corrupting Sargeras is a theory, canon has him get dishearted over seeing chaos pop up all the time and begin to think chaos is the natural state of things and creates the burning legion.  Also he is stronger than old gods, he's a casual planet buster and the compendium has the pantheon beat the old gods and the burning legion beat the pantheon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I lived in Appalachia for a long time, in a place called Bear Creek, not far from an old strip mine.  Very remote.  It's nice though it depends heavily on the folks around you.  You might have white trash in a dilapidated trailer with trash all over their yard ( no city code, no mayor.  You live in something called a township that has one or two people governing it every dozen or so square miles.). Or you could live by a farmer who's lived in the valley all his life, like his grandfather had and his grandfather had.

Everyone waves.  People hand out extra harvest like you wouldn't believe.  The gossip is horrible.  The roads will get snowed in and stay that way for days.  A few people died every year on bear creek to the roads.  You'll most likely live in a valley, so you'll get less sun in the winter, making it like an ice box but the summers will be nice.

Also watch out for goatmen and the devil, my grandpa told me both walk around in the hills.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're probably feeling a lot of new stresses and strains that you're not used to.  Make sure to give your eyes a break every now and then, five minutes, at least, every hour.  Go to the bathroom or get a snack or something.  Moving to give your eyes a break will also let you move around, which you should also do every hour.  Stretch a bit, pop some bones, etc.  when you're sitting, fiddle with your chair until it is perfect for your posture.  Good posture is important and, just like going from a sit down to a physics job will leave you tired for a few weeks, practicing good posture is going to be hard for a few weeks but it will help a lot in the long run.  Get a thermos and fill it with something, add ice, take a sip of you feel yourself dozing off.  Listening to music during your 5 minute breaks if you want, I do.  Listen to music when you work if you want/can, I do.  Seek people out to be social during your five minute breaks: network, offer help, learn.  This will help you appear more helpful, useful, and promotable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trump is a corporate man, but I don't see him a pro corporate so much as pro America.  All of us, even corporations.  The gutting trade deals and crack down on use of illegal/foreign work force will hurt corporations but help the work class immensely.  On the flip side, he supports a flat tax, which has historically benefiting the rich and powerful people/corporations.   I think Trump is just disgusted with the system he's forced to play in to be a competitive business and truly wants to change it to his vision of how it should be.  While he is undoubtably more qualified then myself for the making of this vision, that doesn't mean it all sits well for me.

As for Hillary, she will be the worst president since Andrew Johnson. </TEXT>

Bonesaw could cure Banner mid fight, undo SW's mutation genes, or just end the world by turning all water into bacteria sludge.  But Jack.  Assuming his powers work on powered individuals like they do in Worm (as they should, to make it a fair fight) Jack could prey on some of the more unhinged in Marvel and get allies.

<TEXT> Speed force but let me explain how.  Unlike superman or GL, the speed force allows Flash to ignore things like sonic booms and air displacement.  When the flash runs, he is existing in the normal world and the speed force at once.  The faster he goes, the less of him is in our world and the more of him is in the speed force.  This dimensional/existential fuckery allows flash to do things that bend physics over and make them his bitch.  When he breaks the speed of sound, to our perception, he is just shifting more into the speed force so it makes no sonic boom.  When he goes 1000 mph in between cars down a busy street, people might catch a glimpse of him if they were paying attention, but he's effectively without mass relative to the air and would be like someone flashing their brights.  You would flinch but that's about it.  

Now if he hits you at these speeds, you'll feel it.  If he wanted to, he could go fast enough to spaghettify you with a hit.  But thanks to the speed force, flash can run around the earth at the speed of light with no ill affects (instead of causing a solid line of nuclear explosions in his wake as he turns the atoms he's hitting into pure energy) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Harriet Tubman was a conductor on the Underground Railroad that moved runaway slaves from the south to the free states in the north.  She is famous because she was a woman conductor, never got caught, and did countless runs.  She has also become a figure of the early civil rights movement.  

There are legitimate reasons to chose someone over her for the twenty.  Many people feel she was selected for being a woman or for being black, which is positive racism and sexism.  I personally would have chosen Martin Luthor King Jr. Due to him being the face of the civil rights movement in general but that isn't my call to make.  People will see these legitimate claims, words like sexism and racism being thrown around, and go full KKK in expression their racist/sexist views, it's just the nature of sensitive topics in general to attract ignorant people.   

Edit: as many have pointed out, and I apologize for not explicitly stating this, this was not an actual railroad ( though the railroad was used, I'm sure). It was a route north that constantly changed due to people trying to catch them.  It was mostly through the woods and along rivers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like the responses so far, but no one is mentioning the most powerful pereon alive on Azeroth, Malfurion.  Malfurion, the first Druid, went toe-to-toe with the dread lord Kathra'natir, a feat only repeated by the first guardian, Alodi.  Malfurion has been gaining strength for 10,000 years since that feat, able to fight Ancients and even push back Ragneros (with some help) back into the elemental plane of fire.  We haven't sent Malfurion go against something where he loses.  We don't know how powerful he really is.

I'll admit full powered Medivh would win against Malfurion, but without the spirit of Sargeras, and especially without the Guardian's blessing, Malfurion wins all rounds.  He can bear through the Warriors, out-cast the casters, and has too many tricks with too much power behind them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lets give this another shot.

Elves and dwarves have changed appearance and attitude throughout history.  The two mythologies where you'll find elves are the closely related Nordic and Celtic mythologies.  /u/itsallfolklore already talked about the Prose Edda and their "elves."  However, the dark elves seem closer to dwarves, as they live underground and were able to craft new hair for Sif after Loki cut it off, both of these are main themes in for Tolkien's dwarves.

But for elves and dwarves in celtic literature.  In celtic myths, elves are seen as more mischievous if not out-right malevolent.  Old medicine books like Balt's Leechbook and Wio Faerstice list elves as the cause for such maladies as elfshot, a pain caused my elves shooting you with arrows.  Later we can see the myth of elves have stayed mostly the same in Romeo and Juliet, during Marcutio's speech about Queen Mab, how she may give women pleasure nightly pleasure or warts.  Here we see fairies and elves used interchangeably.  Even as late as 1884, when Princess Nobody was published and The Shoemaker was translated, elves were both described as, and drawn as little fairy people.

Scandinavian elves are much more similar to celtic elves than Tolkien's elves, though they would fall between the two.  While some elves were small like celtic elves, as in The Elf of the Rose, but they could also be the size of a human when luring men into their elven dances.

Dwarves are much less interesting.  Tolkien's dwarves are closer to the myths of gnomes, which Paracelsus used interchangably with pygmys, called them earth elementals who live underground and are only about a foot tall.  Later, closer to Tolkien's life, gnomes were described as small people who live underground and protect riches in Among the Gnomes: An Occult Tale of Adventure in the Untersberg.

Tolkien elves, dwarves, and humans are a christian allegory.  The Silmarillion is a bible of sorts.  Dwarves as a sort of Ishmael - an interference with God's (Illuvatar's) providence brought about by impatience, who would throughout history be at variance with the Elves.  Abraham and his sons compare with Fanwe.  Faenor is not Joseph, but instead is cast from Eden.  Earendil has something in common with Enoch and Elijah, in that he, as mortal, achieved passage to the blessed realm.  The devil was imprisoned for 1000 years and allowed free again, exactly the same as Melkor.  There are several differences that I wont go into, but the parallels are many.  

Tolkien grabbed bits and pieces of several myths, kept some characteristics, and added heavy christian framing.  While he didn't invent them entirely, he did put a new spin on elves and dwarves that has lasted into current pop culture.

I did not forget about orcs, I just have no idea where they came from. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Short answer: Yes

Slightly less short answer: the general description of elves and dwarves were not made up, they both shared similarities with exist legends, in broad strokes.  Aconnection with the forests, aloofness, indifference to men for elves; a life lived underground, greed, selfishness, distrust of men, dwarves are more a composite of dwarfs and the friendlier parts of gnomes (goblins got the unfriendly parts). Where Tolkien's vision for these fantasy races starts is in the more fine details that do exist as current fantasy tropes.  Even the names, elves and dwarves, was sent back by his editor with elves changed to elfs and dwarves to dwarfs because that was the current day plural of the almost entirely different mythical creature.

Long answer: Go get a bachelors in philology with a minor in history.  Possibly a masters as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All we really have to go on is the name; the three blasphemies.  This makes me think it is a reverse of the holy trinity, the father, the son, and the Holy Spirit.  This ties in well with them returning if one is alive, they are most likely one being inhabiting three bodies like their namesake implies.  (High master rating). But three bodies to a mind does not a religious mockery make.  This would lead me to believe that the three bodies are not the same and do not share the same powers. We would have a Christ-like figure, most likely resembling what this thing once was, a disembodied spirit (high stranger/mover), and some form that allows fire and brimstone to rain down (high blaster).

If I had to guess, I would say three shard connecting to one person and absolutely ripped his mind apart, much like the rank 15 parahumans crazyribbon gave us examples of.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, the only one who can resist the ring out of this bunch is current Goku due to his God status. The ring is magical.  Cap, superman, and pre-God Goku all have desires.  The only way to resist the ring is to have dreams that the ring can not twist (like Sam seeing himself as a Garden dictator forcing everyone to turn the world into a well kept garden while he rode around on a horse, muscles and shirtless) or the power offered by the ring is a trifle ( hi-dol, merry-ole). 

Cap fails hard.  His will will work against him as it drives him to better himself.  Similarly, while supes is powerful, the ring offers him magic power, and he is a very tragic character who has lost a lot and doesn't want to lose more.

Goku is the embodiment of increasing power but he has shown a very high resistance to magic since going supercyan that he just didn't have before.  This will let SSG Goku resist the ring.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> An idea.  Combining this thought process with the fact that men are more likely to have genetic abnormalities.  My psychology professor said something that has stuck with me.  For every disorder like depression, and GAD, it is theorized there is a disorder that works in the opposite; making someone perpetually happy and ambitious or contented and out going.  These would go almost entirely unreported as there would be no reason for someone to seek out a professional.  

With this in mind, what if men are more likely to be successful because we're more likely to get good and bad genetic diseases? </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of people are saying how the pipe weed is just tobacco, etc.  but you have to realize that Gandalf wouldn't smoke pipe weed if it was marijuana.  Marijuana is a depressant.  Gandalf is in the body of a frail old man, his mind is his weapon and he keeps it sharp.  Gandalf would hate pipe weed if it slowed his mind and sapped his will.  However, a stimulant like tobacco is exactly the kind of thing someone like Gandalf would smoke often for its affects ( and for the social aspect).  We also see him drink very little and never get drunk throughout the books.

As for his physical body, he did have one at the time of the War of the Ring, but it was sickly and frail.  Sauron himself tortured Gollum.  As far as turning invisible, the ring pulls the wearer into the shadow realm if the user can not resist the pull.  If they can, they exist in both realms like the ring wraiths.  This is why anyone who wore the ring traveled west; they were no longer wholly of this realm as a piece of them had forever faded. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The blessing of Manwe and Yavanna can be taken from Aragorn seeming to be supernaturally commanding, even to strangers who don't know who he is.  Aragorn is also able to use magical properties in plants only kings can, which directly tied into Yavanna.  These feats are in the book trilogy.  

Aragorn's lineage is detailed at length in the silmarillion.  Melion is the great grandmother of Elrond and Elros.  Elrond chose to be elf and Elros chose to be human and became king of the numenoreans of which Aragorn is the rightful heir.  

Tolkien wrote later in his notes the times Eru interviewed in the world, one of which was tripping Gollum. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To add to this, the ring also enhanced his already significant ability to influence and command people.  As for the right amount of power to put in the ring, Sauron was originally a maiar of Aule, the craftsmen, and a power maiar at that.  Despite having no direct hand in making the elven rings, the elven craftsmen still used Sauron's methods and this is what gave Sauron power over the elven rings.

And as for Sauron's ignorance of Aragorn and mistake thinking no one could he destroy the ring, he was completely justified.  Aragorn is the rightful king (which garners a blessing from Manwe and Yavanna) of the line of Elros the half elven, mix of man and elf with the boon of both and hardly a drawback of neither, descendent from the maiar Melion, one of the strongest Maiar we see.  No one but Eru himself knew how powerful a wildcard like Aragorn truly was.  And Sauron was right about no one being able to destroy it, it took direct intervention from Eru to trip Gollum. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jack would steer around S-class threats but not fighting them head on.  His shard is The Communicator rather than receiver, he's the closest thing to a telepath in worm as his shard can "talk" to other shard and figure out what they're doing.  For contessa, her shard would tell her and, inadvertently, Jack the path for beating Jack.  Jack would know the path and avoid it.  So Contessa's power would say 102 steps to kill Jack... Recalculating, 135 steps to kill Jack... Recalculating, 177 steps to kill Jack... And so on.  As for taking on eidolon or Alexandria, the communicator shard implies going both ways.  We're moving into speculation here, but it's implied that jack's shard will talk to other shard and say "this human and I are a fountain of knowledge unparalleled, you should not kill me as it detracts from our goal" and the other shard agrees, directing the cape to go nonlethal or even purposefully lose.  When a shard goes against its host, bad things happen (see Leet)

This can cause problems as newborn's diets should consist of incredibly fatty colostrum and the mother's body not following the usually schedule can result in  digestion problems from drinking milk immediately post partem or simply having nothing to eat as the woman is not expressing." </TEXT>

<TITLE> A way out there theory on Parian's powers. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-12 06:40:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been thinking over Parian's power and how WoG states it will be useful against Behemoth.  I'll state and support two points for my theory.

Parian is a bud off of Behemoth.

Parian's power is Nitrokenises, or the control of nitrogen while in gaseous form.

First, what nitrogen is and can do.  Nitrogen is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere, roughly 70%.  As far as weight goes, it is a fairly light gas but can exert a lot of force when put under pressure.  Pressurized nitrogen gas is used in powerful air powered guns and fire extinguishers.  Lightening can not form without nitrogen.  ATP energy making cells in the body need nitrogen (personal theory on how Behemoth cooks people from the inside out, uses all their ATP at once.)

As for Parian's current use of her power and how it could really be the manipulation of gaseous nitrogen, this is easy to explain as well.  Filling her dolls with her telekinesis as she does is actually her pushed no more and more nitrogen into the container until she is able to manipulate the whole of the container filled with the gas.  The leaking she feels whenever the doll is punctured is nitrogen literally leaking back into the atmosphere.  The fine manipulation Parian manages of small needles, threads, etc, is her extremely fine control of the nitrogen gas blowing the light object where she will it.  This explains the breakdown of control for heavier objects, she has to use more force to push with the nitrogen in the air and the result is unstable.  Parian is also extremely limited by the Manton Effect or else she could just stop your brain from getting any energy and kill you with a though.  Or Behemoth you from the inside out.

So since WoG states Parian got her powers during a behemoth attack, and behemoth is very predictable, it's safe to assume he was using his control of all energy forms during the fight.  While we don't know if endbringers can bud or not, the potential to counter while being similar to behemoth with nitrokinesis is high enough to assume, in my opinion.

<TEXT> Well, a few reasons, none of them very good on their own but add up to outweigh the other option imo.  Business owners have money to make any legal battles long and costly, since they have everything to lose they'll fight tooth and nail.  As much as I hate to spout "Job creator" arresting and closing the businesses you want to instead hire legal employees seems like throwing the baby out with the bath water.  And closing all of the places where illegals do illegal work won't get rid of the illegals immigrants, just drive them to do illegal work.  Essentially you would be treating a symptoms and ignoring the underlying issue.

It's not that people don't want to do the work illegal immigrants do, it's that illegal immigrants drive the wage of the jobs down to McDonalds levels.  Adjusted for inflation for the pay in the 80s, a farm hand and a meat packer, the two jobs heaviest in use of illegal labor, should make around 15 and 21 dollars an hour, respectively.  There isn't much unskilled labor that pays near that, especially ones high school kids can do, farm hand. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a breakdown of what my horribly understaffed cap team two does.  We usually have 5 people a day counting supervisors.

Set up truck.  This involves pulling my the freight away from the doors and toward the back of our tiny 3 bay back room.  Usually half of the steel can't be pulled because of old freight just there.  Also apparel has their dozen or so full roll bars back there as well.  

So the truck is set up and I get to throw for the fourth time this week because my coworkers who showed up are all inexperienced, morbidly obese, 65 year old women, or have one leg.  So I can't supervise now.  The line moves so slowly I have time to fill it, jump out of the truck and stack on a few skids at the front and separate the fright on either side of the line before jumping back in and throwing some more.  As the day goes on it becomes apparent that we have no room.  We backload into yesterday's trailer which takes time.  We finish with hopefully no meal violations.

After lunch management keeps us from pulling until 9.  They put two people on it and one usually leaves at 10.  I had to cut 7 hours last week.  I came in and worked for one hour.  Anyway, the freight takes way too long.  Management has us checking off every single thing over 50$ on the truck since we had over 2% shrink this inventory.  So I usually sweep and close the truck around 1am.  Every associate but two leaves at 11 every night so I might leave by 12 to if one of them is there.

This turned a lot more rant-y than I wanted it too. Sorry </TEXT>

<TEXT> A big theme in Tolkien's work is power passing through noble and royal bloodlines.  You see this a lot as every hero, from Pippin to Bard, they are all noble or even royal.  Gimli is of the line of Durin, though not the royal line.  His father was Gloin, his father was Groin, his father was Farin, his father was Boran, and his father was king Nain.  Despite not being the Royal bloodline, he is still the dwarf equivalent of noble.

Legolas, son of elven King Thranduil, is naturally a prince.  I don't think his age or if he was the crown prince was ever stated.  But being a prince gives him a lot of power.

Aragorn has a lot of power in his line.  On top of having elves and even Maiar in his ancestry, he is the last of the line of kings of numenor.  This includes being rightful king of Gondor. 

Even with their inherent power, each had a few magic items a piece.

Aragorn had a Lothlorian cloak, the sword of kings, a scabbard that sharpened and cleaned his sword, and the pendent given by Arwen to protect him.

Legolas had a Lothlorian cloak and bow, as well as a quiver that always let him pull the exact arrow he wanted.  His shoes may have been magic as let him run on fresh powder without leaving a foot print, but tolkien later wrote in a letter than elves are as light as a feather.

Gimli had a Lothlorian cloak and we know his arms and armor came from the stores of the lonely mountain, so they likely had magic in them like all mithril seems to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aragorn is a numenorean, specifically the royal heir and therefore has the strongest blood.  The lives thrice as long as men, stand slightly taller, and have a affinity for the magic of the land (making magic from herbs and nature).  The closest fantasy trope would be a half elf.  A big theme in Tolkien's writings were power being passed through blood, so while all numenoreans had elven blood, Aragorn's elven lineage was very strong.  As was his Distant Maiar lineage.  Fun fact, Elrond is Aragorn's great^16ish uncle.  Elrond's brother was the progenitor of the numenorean royal line. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That doesn't make much since regarding the final battle at the black gate.  The whole strategy hinged on Sauron believing Aragorn had taken and became master of the ring (just like he did with the palantir).  Granted, Aragorn is no man, but he is only distantly related to elves and VERY distantly related to a maiar.  Could someone like Boromir or Samwise control the ring?  No, not at all.  But Aragorn, Elrond, galadrial, and probably even legolas could over power Sauron's will for control of the ring (Sauron is in a very weakened state during Tlotr) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well DBZ abridged actually added a fourth metric of power levels.  In DBZ there's ki, martial power, and magic; abridged introduces toon force.  Everyone is pretty similar their counterpart with the exception of some genre saviness besides Goku, Krillan, and Nappa.  The thing about toon force is that it grows strong stronger off of the other person's seriousness.  For Nappa, abridged Nappa would dominate in a hilarious way because it would be funny.  Abridged Goku would take it 6/10 for the same reason as Nappa.  Abridged Killan would actually lose pretty handily because funny and he seems generally less capable and confident.  

Honorable mention for abridged Yamcha,  he loses all fights always.

Fingolfin already proved he is a force of nature in a fight, but Faenor would somehow get ahold of something to boost his power or outright decimate Fingolfin with a bit of time to prepare.  The fight would have a lot of implication though, fingolfin hates faenor but not enough to kill him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is true and I considered this in my post.  At full power, Eru calls Melkor the mightiest of the Valar after they sing the song of creation so this statement includes all Valar, the ones who went to Arda and the ones that didn't.  Tulkas is the only one who could hope to beat Melkor in combat at full strength but Melkor is most likely too clever/capable to fight Tulkas on even footing.  At his peak, it took all of the Ainur to defeat Melkor and his minions (which are an extension of his power.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Probably.  But you chose poor representatives for their respect race.  Boromir is one of the mightiest humans Arda.  In the hobbit Gandalf says that he chooses a thief, bilbo, because a hero is not available to slay smaug.  In the trilogy he calls boromir a hero of his kingdom.  What little feats he has are ridiculous.  Strength wise he was able to keep up with Aragorn, someone above peak human, at shoveling snow banks taller than them with their bare hands.  In Moria he cleaves straight through a mountain troll's (the giant ones) arm in one stroke of his sword.  He uses a one handed sword.  

Legolas is an elf and he's no push over, being a prince (Tolkien was a big fan of power running naturally in royals/nobles) but he's just a strong elf.  Sure he can carry a hobbit and throw a goblin, but he's speed to Boromir's strength.  

Tl;dr.  Elves are, on average, stronger than humans physically.  But Boromir is likely the physically strongest humanoid on middle earth. </TEXT>

Also Sargeras cut a planet in half, so there's that. I would put him near Odin in power.

<TEXT> Yes, we've even seen some.  But remember that not all Maia are suited for battle.  Sauron, for instance, is a Maia of Aule the Craftsman.  He has a direct hand in making the rings of power and was capable of crafting feats none but most likely Aule himself could replicate.  But he was simple as strong as a strong elf in combat.  I mean, some of the old elves like Fingolfin held their own against Melkor in single combat, a feat some Ainur couldn't do.  Then you have Gandalf, a powerful Maia of Manwe who could inspire the hearts and minds of man and elf, but was only able to match an average Maia of Melkor in single combat.  Maiar are sort of pigeon-holed into the supernatural abilities they have.  If their specific task involves combat, like oerome or the Balrog General, then their forms are truly terrifying to face on the battlefield.  But if their domain is protecting the forest, like Melion and her barrier capable of keeping all enemies out or seeking out all forms of knowledge like saruman, then their magic would be less effective.  I mean,  Saruman was stabbed to death by wormtongue... </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of questions, I'll try to answer then all.  The first one, the West Gate, requires a history lesson.  During the second age the Nolder, the elves who refused Manwe's request to travel to the undying lands to live and opted to stay in middle earth, lived close to the dwarves and became close allies.  These elves helped the dwarves to build the West gate that the fellowship enter.  As for having the password on the door, you have to understand how secret the elven languages were.  Gandalf knew elven, of course, Aragorn did as well, and Frodo knee a little.  Before you can learn a word of elven you have to be declared Elf-friend which is no small feat.  It's not mentioned in the movies, but Frodo walked often with the elves in the forests around the shire and it took him over a decade to become an Elf-friend.  So the chances of anyone being able to read the language who wouldn't be welcome are extremely slim.  Like, a few people in middle earth slim.  

As for how Gollum got in, I don't think it's ever stated, more implies he's able to scuttle through and air shaft or run-off hole.

The orcs did know about the mithril.  However, since the dwarves had hundreds of thousands of mithril arms and armor, and the remaining mithril was very very deep down in Moria, they were probably contented to work with what they had.  Keep in mind the city had much more steel arms and armor than mithril, enough to field multiple armies.  All superior to orcish iron. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well there's a few problems with your idea.  As others have already mentioned, the ring has more of an aura of corruption than grows stronger the closer you are to it.  Also, though it's never touched on in the movies, the ring can change sizes at will, able to fit the hand of Sauron and Frodo/Bilbo.  In fact, when making the journey up the side of mount doom the ring kept changing sizes hoping to be dropped to buy itself time for the ringwraiths to arrive.   So there's a good chance it would just grow to unplug itself or to bust out of any container. </TEXT>

In fact, the maiar Melian is his great grand mother and whose most memorable feat includes protecting her entire kingdom with a magical barrier known as The Girdle of Melion, so you could say protecting his kingdom with magic is in his blood, not to mention he had a ring of power increasing his already substantial magic.  

Also his grandfather is a human, Beren, and his brother, Elros, is Aragorn's great(to the 16th) grandfather.  Aragorn married his cousin.  It's complicated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The forgotten realms elven language has never been codified to the best of my knowledge.  However, since FR elves are based off Tolkien's elves in many, many ways, I can assume that they share a language. 

The elvish word for love is Mela when used alone and -mael- when combined with another word as in A'maelamin which means 'my beloved'

So to answer your question about language similarities, elvish is more of a Germanic language in how it handles syntax and the combining of words.  It sounds a lot softer, though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My paladin is a combat medic that focuses on multiple ways of healing.  His first go-to option is the light, obviously.  This is easy enough to manifest because the light is all around and inside of us.  Whenever he is mending someone injured the light visibly emanates from himself and the other person as we are the conduit always, he is just drawing more light from you than normal.  

As for the more inherently evil beings  he has to heal, he has learned very very basic nature magic (enough to stop the bleeding and stabilize only) and is learned in the art of rune crafting (inscription).  This was thought up back when herbalism have you a HoT and I just kept it in anyway.  With his arcane ruins he can increase the body's natural regeneration after stabilizing the evil being who he is trying to save.  The nature magic came from the earth, vines literally sprouting from the ground and burrowing into the dying person and sacrificing their own health.  The ruins pull magic from the near-by lay-lines like any other arcane spell.  It just sort of pops into existence.

Worst case scenario, he has even temporarily turned someone to stone and brought them to Archerus to be healed by their fellow death Knights.  This was done via a potion that reacted with a human body alchemically (despite being dead).

The point I make is that there are many ways to manifest magic depending on the source, many of them cannon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes to everything.  Sting isn't one of those radar things from Alien, it's just a magical elven dagger.  The glow depends on: number of goblins/orcs, and nearness of goblins/orcs.  Interesting enough, Gabdalf's sword, Glamdring(known to the goblins as beater) and Thorin's sword, Foehammer (known to the goblins as biter and also not a hammer) glowed just like sting did in the books, and they also made goblins run at the sight of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fingolfin is arguably the strongest being who was not an ainur on middle earth as far as combat went.  He was easily the strongest elf, the strongest son of Finwe ( one of the first elves, father of Faenor creator of the silmarils.)  so it really wasn't just a rank and file elf challenging Morgoth to a duel, it was Fingolfin, High King of the Noldier challenging Morgoth.  And Morgoth was also weakened at the time, ungolioth's bite having forced him to stay in his physical form (ainur and maiar are not inherently physical beings). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, I was/am in a similar situation as you, except in the husband.  Deadbedroom since the birth of our son.  I acted, physically, how your husband acts to my wife after the deadbedroom got to be too much.  It may be different for him, but I acted out this way for a few reasons.  The big one is the pent up sex drive, when sex dreams about your wife surpass actual sex with your wife in frequency, hypersexualizing my wife is how I coped.  But it is unfair to treat someone as a sex symbol day in and day out and expect them to reciprocate, let alone enjoy it.  I've winced changed my habits, showing my affection by putting my hand on her hip or giving her lower back a rub--something physical but much less sexualizing.  The butt slaps and boob grabs still happen but a lot less frequently.  And instead of undressing randomly, I step to help before her shower or when changing outfits.  So far only one zipper incident...

The insults... I'm not proud of this but I did manage to keep the feelings internal, mostly.  Again, now sure how he feels, but I saw my wife's rejection of my middleschool like attempts at affection as just that, rejection.  It got to the point that looking at my wife's body in a sexual way (which, remember, I did constantly) would make me angry.  I was angry that someone I married, someone who used to have sex with my several times a week, seemed so against the idea of physical intimacy with me.  Was age making me unattractive?  Did she just pretend to like sex to make me happy?  Was she just using me for kids, income, and a father figure?  Again, not proud.  We had a long, long sit down talk.  We needed it.  If you feel like he isn't able then put a counselor between to the of you to mediate.  I've realized that my wife's attraction is mental more than physical.  I really had no idea before that.  I've stopped internalizing and villainizing her in this and come to terms with how we both need to work on our bedroom.

Good luck to the both of you.  After making all these changes in my life, nothing about my wife's sex drive has changed.  But she has agreed to see a doctor about her hormonal levels after she gives birth and finishes breastfeeding ( sex the first time in 3 months and she gets pregnant.  No sex for 2 months after.  Boy did I feel used at the time.). So don't give up hope! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dr. Doom is ruthless, but not evil.  Everything he does is for the good of someone.  Do his ends always justify his means?  Maybe not.  Maybe you're just on the wrong side at the wrong time.  Then you have to realize that Doom is really prideful and unfortunately second best.  Second best scientist next to Richards, second best engineer to stark, second best peak human next to cap, second best magician next to Strange.  The list goes on and, as you can imagine, the guy is a one man wrecking crew.  

When he was passed over for the title Sorcerer Supreme of Earth, he received a boon as compensation for coming in second.  He used this boon, instead of for any sort of revenge, to travel with Strange to hell and save his mothers soul.  The only way to do this was to have his mother forever think of him as a monster but she would have these thoughts in a higher plane.

Outside of Greek mythology, the Pegasus has been a symbol of wisdom and bravery all the way through the European medieval period where it was seen as the wisest and most noble creature, to the renaissance where it represented art and beauty, all the way up to WWII where it was the UK's paratrooper's logo.

Honestly, the dragon kind of stole the Pegasus's shtick in modern times. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh wow, okay.  Where to start...

I think your both hurt.  Going from the OP and this comment, I think he has a lot of anxiety and frustration about himself that is bleeding into his desire to have sex with you and that, coupled with point one and two, is most likely his main issue.

As for comments like you saying you thought of his best friend, never is that okay.  You're not only hurting him when you say that but you're also confirming his delusions of inferiority.  

You may not like porn or "fucking" but he does.  There is another post on here that read something to the affect of: we don't do things our SO does because we suddenly enjoy them, we do things they enjoy because their joy brings us joy.  And this invites them to do something for we choose and share in our joy.  You say you don't want to end this relationship despite friends, family, and experts telling you to do so.  Well it's going to take sacrifice, experimentation, patience, and a truly monumental effort on both of your parts because it sounds like you two are in a really bad spot.  

So he's ducking you, emulating the porn stars.  Duck him back, still follow my advice despite you not wanting to act like a porn star.  This will build his confidence back up because if the testosterone isn't helping then it isn't physical, his problem is mental.

Yes you will work harder than him.
Yes you will put more of yourself out there
You will leave your comfort zone

Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are three major things going on here, that I see.

First, I think he has a porn addiction.  It might not seem like an addiction if it's only every other day, but he most likely still is LL and that is just his sex drive; he is quelling his sex drive the moment it builds up.

Another thing which may have caused the first is that porn is a fantasy.  If you explore the niche corners of porn, you'll find things that are very extremely, things that should impossible, and things that are so out there that they can only be portrayed through drawings.  Your husband most likely showed you the tamest porn he likes so as not to weird you out.  You can show him weird things you're into and he could do the same when he knows you won't run away screaming, but my wife hasn't looked at me the same since I showed her /r/hucow so be aware of what you're getting into there

Lastly, sex and masturbation are not the same thing.  Sex is a loving, intimate union between two people.  Masturbation is more like me and my penis going on an amusement park fun ride that is over before you know it.  Yeah, he a sex drive for both but that's where it ends.  It's no substitute for sex and more like a band aid for a missing limb.  This is a HL with a LL saying this, so trust me.

Now for what you can do to; incorporate the porn.  Join in on his masturbation, offer to give him a blow job or a hand job instead of him using his hand.( possible rejection point 1) Forewarning, most men have a mastery of their genitalia so it may take a bit to make him cum like he can with himself.  Try this a few times and after each time tell him you're going to go finish yourself off.  After a few times  tell him it's his turn. (Possible rejection point 2).  This could be foreplay if he's ready to go after your turn.

If you're rejected at point 1 then he needs counseling for his addiction.  If you're rejected at point two then he needs counseling for being a selfish prick.  If he refused counseling then... I'm sorry. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because everyone keeps getting knocked back to the Stone Age.

Nmenreans were in the renaissance when sauron convinced them to attack the undying lands (it didn't go well for them) forcing them to become the nomadic wanderers we see it the books.

Rohan was nomadic at odds with Gonder until very recently.

Gonder has been subjugated, suffered revolts, and devastated by a plague whenever it gets close to any sort of technology.

The Easterlings get subjugated, suffer revolts, devastated by plagues, and conquered by sauron whenever they come close to technology.

The dwarves' greed always gets the best of them.  Wether it's attracting dragons, tunneling into orcish kingdoms, awakening literal demons from below the earth, or declaring war on an elven kingdom ruled and protected by a maiar, the dwarves can be short sighted and have their kingdoms sacked and riches stolen.

Lastly there's the elves.  Why would you create anything to pass down to your children when you can pick up and go to paradise?  The last elven house to get all uppity and innovative made a few magic jewels and promptly died trying to get them back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Boromir 10/10 every round.

This can be broken down into high fantasy versus low fantasy.  Some feats of Boromir include cleaving a cave troll's arm (the big ones) clean off in a single swing.  He single handedly faught a company of Uruk-hai shock troopers and killed 20 of them before succumbing to his wounds.  

As far as gear goes, his cloak keeps him hidden from his enemies and his belt was some other sort of unexplained magic.

This fight isn't between two men, it's between a man and Man, chosen race of Eru Ilvatar. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So this small subreddit blew up when Jon and Nicole posted and we know Arin has been on here.  Just now there is a post on the front page involving Arin's father and he responds in 9 hours.  Furthermore, all his recent posts are in /r/deadgrumps and /r/conspiracygrumps and they tend to [deny any possible wrong-doing by Arin](http://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyGrumps/comments/2ipdc3/will_arin_remove_the_jonera_grumpisodes/) or [give no ground](http://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyGrumps/comments/2ipdc3/will_arin_remove_the_jonera_grumpisodes/cmpcrn1) [about what happened](http://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyGrumps/comments/2ipdc3/will_arin_remove_the_jonera_grumpisodes/cmne0t7)

Now it could be he knows nothing and liked defending his son against accusers, which is very possible, but this is conpiracy grumps.  We know Grumps watch the subreddit but could a PR team be watching it as well? 

If this is the case, wont people alleged to have given information like RicePirate and Ross be immediately cracked down on, stopping any leaks before we can find anything out?  Delving further into conspiracy, we know downvoting bots and upvoting bots are on reddit and what's stopping this PR team from leading us down wrong path after wrong path, keeping the truth buried where they want it?

Just a ranting conspiracy theorist. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've heard the main reason being money tossed around here a lot and it got me thinking about a few instances here and there.

In the new game grumps episode Amazing world, not only is Arin okay with 100 dollars being dropped for a joke(showing they have a good amount of funds coming in now even split between 5 people.) But Ross has to ask, almost beg Arin to let him use the grump account.  Furthermore, this means the funds are tied up in an account that Arin controls.  

Second instance of evidence happens in the cricket episode.  Did you see the grump space?  A large building like that with wall to wall games, a kitchenette, and it looked new.  Possibly an addition on Arin's house?  If it's an addition, new building, or even just old space, the dozen or so arcade games would cost a very pretty penny.

So maybe the disagreement was over the direction of game grumps?  It sure as hell became a lot more profitable after two more people came on the payroll. </TEXT>

However.  Aragorn isn't a soldier, he's a ranger.  He tracked gollum 200 miles through marshes and mountains, he can feed four fat Hobbits from shit in the woods alone.  Don't get me wrong l, he is beyond peak human in many aspects, he's just a ranger first and a soldier second.  I still give it to cap.  Now if this were in the woods cap would find a trap around his shield arm or an arrow in his back before he knew what hit him.

<TEXT> It has to do mainly with two things, RAM and ROM.  When ever you start your computer ( or phone, or router, or new car) it takes everything that it is, which is stored on the ROM and loads it into the RAM.  This is done because computers can read RAM faster and you get to keep a backup of your computer on your ROM.  Anyway, when something goes wrong, something stops working right or your computer freezes, 90% something in the RAM messed up, many things can mess in the RAM.  So when we turn it off, the RAM wipes clean, then when we turn it back on it reloads the RAM from the ROM, most likely fixing the problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not as much as I used to in the retail side of things.  On average, I might get 2 or three in a week.

When I do get those calls, I deal with costumers in the most polite way possible and try to explain why something is the way it is.  No I can't refund this $250 purchase to a card not on the account when you can't answer my security questions.  If all else fails, you have one harassment warning before I can terminate the call, so that's nice.

A lot of people make small-talk, we actually are trained to lure you into small-talk.  Most small talk involved features and recommendations but a lot of elderly callers (which constitute a large majority of mayday users) love to make small talk about what plenty of things.  These conversations are actually one of the better parts of the job because it makes everyone's day better.

Weirdest call I ever got was on Mayday.  Someone called with a picture of a sausage full screened on the web browser, they only needed help with one question.  "Would you like the beef?"  I declined.  I admired their dedication to the prank simply because all of their personal information was beef related in some way, all of it.  They gave me a negative review, though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. It doesn't, but they honestly don't really care what you have on your screen as long as it isn't illegal or harassing.  

2. And of the background which is regulated to orange and white, or a nice beige. 

3. Joke's on you, you can not change the HDX's wallpaper at this time anyway.

4. Yes they do, as does what ever you have on your silk browser.

5. It actually spits out a generic "Disabled during mayday" message and promptly closes.

I mean, if you need help sending your junk to someone, they can help you do that as long as you're polite and respectful about it.  My friend helped someone get a porn video playing the other day.  The guy was okay until he started asking my friend their preferred porn; flags were raised and permanently affixed to accounts at that point.

<TEXT> Weirdest call would probably be from a girl who maydayed in when an app wasn't working properly.  It had to be updated, easy call.  But after the problem was fixed, she proceeded to talk to me about said app, which featured customizable 3d avatars she showed off to me, and asked what kind of music I listened too.  It was very surreal and sad because I think she was a lonely tween girl based on her voice and choice of avatar style.

Second weirdest was someone maydayed in with a picture of a sausage full screened and asked if I wanted the beef before ending the call. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Be happy you take no negatives in your ability modifiers because there is no such thing as a dump stat in d20 modern (unless you min/max)

Strong heroes are fun, they're the only class to start with full BaB and have a decent defense.  The strong hero talents are a joke compared to other classes, though.  Unless you're going to play the combat guy, I would go into another class.

So there are two types of strong heroes: melee dominators, think monk  and everyone with a gun is a wizard waiting to be shutdown; and ranged soldiers who use their full BaB and good defenses to take bullets while dishing them out.  You could make a sneak character as a strong hero, but they would always be outmatched by a fast hero, so go fast if you want to sneak.

With your stats, I would go ranged strong hero (if you must go strong).  Put your 16 into dex, 14 into con, and spread the rest out however you want.  You wouldn't be able to go battle mind as ranged (or shouldn't) but for a solid melee character you need good dex, strength, and con to not get hit, do damage, and not die respectively.

If you're set on a strong battle mind, I would take a hit to your dex and have 16 str and 14 con.  You will get bit much more, but massive damage has brought the end to many of my characters and melee builds are too feat-starved to take imp. Massive dmg threshold.

So for your strong battle mind:  start with the wild talent feat and pick an occupation that allows you to start with combat martial arts.  For your lvl 2 feat, choose either brawl or power attack.  For your talents, go melee smash tree.  Keep jump maxed until you get I to battle Mind then keep the psi-skill maxed.  I would recommend dipping into fast for a level sometime; the added AC and extra square under the fast movement tree comes in handy for melee characters.

If you have any more questions just PM me.  Sorry for errors, sent from phone. </TEXT>

Minos is actually Cretian for King, so a simple/complex  crown would work just fine.

Minos the king of Knossos had the best navy in ancient (Homer's) Greece, so a ship would make sense

Moving away from Greek things, a simple labyrinth design would work well for our flag, since we are a labyrinth; a short google search of the word brings up many examples.

<TEXT> Another update for the war effort!
I made a [watchtower](http://imgur.com/a/DaV5f) from nothing but wood to be used as cannon fodder for Argoth's cannons!  It's easily destroyable with two hits while still useful for us for seeing over the wall! </TEXT>

<TEXT> A small update with a [cannon](http://imgur.com/a/lEs8Y) design I stole and messed with.  It shoots really far, but doesn't get a lot of arc unless shot at a short range.  I built a model in industrial.

Edit: I updated the cannon to a [Big Cannon](http://imgur.com/a/P11po) which is vastly improved thanks to more explosives.  Not only does it shoot two TNT that fly close to eachother, it shoots over a much greater distance with a much greater lift. </TEXT>

I'm willing to change little details, like the bear, but I think the Brom Bears sounds nice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How modern is Brom going to be?  I ask because I would like to build a space needle, which was built in 62, in new Brom downtown.  It'll be about y75 and 34x34.  

Those measurements aren't final and neither is the project, but it wont change every much.

Some explanation; the base is not under the tower, but the two circle plates are the same for the final product.

<TEXT> Here's my take on the wall, feel free to make corrections.

There were two types of Berlin Wall, one for populated areas, one for less populated areas; eventually the wall became just huge and concrete everywhere, but that would be boring to stare at, so here are two types.

This first one is wooden, cheaper, and meant to be placed everywhere but downtown.
[Wooden fence](http://imgur.com/6NbLS)

This second one is meant for downtown, and looks awfully imposing in my opinion.

So, what do you all think?

<TEXT> I had always let my players roll their own skill checks without much thought into how that can break the immersion into the game.  However, I recently came across a post that got me thinking [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/u9cgj/scumbag_dd_player/c4tixvb) and I was thinking what you all do as far a skill checks; do you let them roll their own or roll for them?
