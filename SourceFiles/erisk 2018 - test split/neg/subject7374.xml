<TITLE> What movies would be an interesting (though not necessarily improved) experience with the black and white treatment seen with Mad Max: Fury Road and soon Logan? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 14:28:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I honestly believe that Ridley Scott's earlier work in Alien and Blade Runner would work well with the black and white treatment, harkening back to the critically-acclaimed early days of monster and crime movies.

Had Alejandro Jodorowsky's Dune come to fruition, from what's been shown in documentary format, I reckon I'd be inclined to include it.

Additionally, I think Scarface might be an intriguing one, having it presented in the same monochromatic format as the original (yep, the 80's Scarface is a remake if you didn't already know).

But I'd like to know your thoughts and ideas. What coloured films would be interesting to you in black and white? </TEXT>

<TEXT> ...did the pre-release footage and screenshots seem to promise a more exciting experience than the product we finally got?

Don't get me wrong; I love FFXV as it is now. Heck, most of us here had been waiting 10 and a half years for it. But look at all the stuff we were shown in those years!

There was that mech footage, the Behemoth in the parking garage, the Prompto gameplay shooting that bird, the party at the top of the building, the Dragoon (Aranea) introduction from the skies, the original Noctis VS Magitek troop assault outside the palace doors, the "tenfold/hundredfold" exchange between Ignis and Noctis, the Altissian hallway battle...you get the idea because you've more than likely seen all the stuff I have.

What do you think? If all the stuff shown in the pre-release footage and images had been included in the final product, would it have enhanced the experience in your opinion, or added too much to game?

I just think XV was shown to be a more excitingly-varied game than we got.

Stay classy, friends and fans. </TEXT>

So, the pilot flies down to the hangar but he doesn't land. He flies in one side of the hangar, comes out the other, turns around and does it again.


The squadron leader calls again and says "I told you to get that plane back in the hangar!"

<TEXT> Here's my two cents.

I honestly believe that re-releasing Journey on the PS4 was a mistake. One of the greatest things about Journey on the PS3 was the lack of social connectivity with the console, like the inability to take screenshots or broadcast footage live. This meant each experience was unique and your own.

Porting it to the PS4 made the unique Journey experiences too accessible to others. With live broadcasting and uploading video clips at the touch of a button, people could experience your journey through Journey...but they wouldn't feel how you feel. Where one sees a romp across high dunes, another sees wasted time.

Journey was great when you had your experiences to yourself. </TEXT>

["Blowing Dirt"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzLBfBtknxk) where a car gets undestroyed.

["Green"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcxnKYsseAw) where the band members freshen up...side down.

["Place To Be"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIQDk0vpKGk) where odd things happen. Well, odd for the early 2000's in a New Zealand apartment complex.

["Sophie"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePo9G-Rzr9k) where sneak increases to 9001.

["Monotone"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEPpkxj_hRw) where...look, it's beekeepers playing badminton, it's shot in reverse like "Blowing Dirt" and only one point is scored. That's basically it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It wasn't a bullet I dodged. It was a discus.

Basically, it was Sports Day at high school and I, not being the most athletic person in the world, volunteered to help with the events, like measuring long jumps and adjusting the bar at the high jump...and measuring discus throws.

So, I'm standing quite a way to the side of the big marked area on the field for legal discus throws, waiting for the next person to throw so I could measure the distance. Anyway, the next person throws and I'm watching the discus soar high into the sky and come back down...straight at my face.

At this point, any normal person would duck or dive out of the way without hesitation. But not me. I'm watching it come towards me for a good few seconds before my mind clicks and I think "Huh, that's coming towards me." Cool as a cucumber (for some fucking reason), I take a single step to the right...and not a moment too soon. As soon as my left foot makes contact with the ground again, the discus hurtles past my left ear so closely that I can hear the bacteria on the discus laughing at me and thuds into the ground behind me.

It wasn't until halfway through bringing the discus back to the throwing cage that rational thought caught up with me, making me break down out of breath at what could have just happened.

And that's the story about how I nearly got killed by a discus.

Don't do sports, kids; it's fucking dangerous out there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In 'House Of Cards', Frank Underwood says "Proximity to power deludes some into thinking they wield it."

Therefore, it wouldn't be a stretch to say that those in proximity to the most powerful person, who in this context knows everything and would thus be the worst person, would believe that they, too, know everything.

So, you're right. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A discrepancy between the books and the movies is the Golden Snitch.

In the book version of The Deathly Hallows, we're told that Snitches have flesh memories, meaning that they will respond to the first person who touches them with bare skin and flesh; this is how Dumbledore managed to keep the Resurrection Stone hidden for Harry.

However, in the movie version of The Philosopher's Stone, Harry is not the one to first touch the Snitch with bare skin and flesh; that distinction goes to none other than Oliver Wood, who showed off the Snitch to Harry prior to Seeker training.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> DID YOU KNOW?

Excluding Legendary Pokmon, Pokmon that are part of an evolutionary line (including Mega Evolution) and Pokmon with other forms, there are only three singular Pokmon (as of pre-release Generation VII) that have unique type combinations. Those Pokmon are:

 
* Skarmory, with the unique typing of Steel/Flying, which it has retained since Generation II.

* Stunfisk, with the unique typing of Ground/Electric, which it has retained since Generation V.

* Hawlucha, with the unique typing of Fighting/Flying, which it has retained since Generation VI.


It is possible that more Pokmon may be added to this list upon the release of Generation VII. Likewise, it is also possible that any of the above three may be excluded from this list due to the same circumstances.

<TEXT>  Following since inception?

I've followed FFXV's progress avidly up to 2014. I've been somewhat abstaining from most of the news about the features and content of FFXV so that I can be pleasantly surprised upon release and so that my expectations aren't shattered when I play it; I'm not expecting this game to not be amazing, but it's still a possibility.


 Keeping interest?

As I mentioned earlier, I haven't been following the progress all that much for the last 2 years. As such, I know there's plenty of content that's old news to some, but will be new to me.


 Coping?

I've been keeping busy with trying to get a job and completing an online Diploma in the interim, not to mention all of the other great games that have been and will be released between now and the 29th of November. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would argue that the entirety of Pink Floyd's "The Dark Side Of The Moon" would be relevant regardless of time. 

From the Wikipedia article: "Each side of the album is a continuous piece of music. The five tracks on each side reflect various stages of human life, beginning and ending with a heartbeat, exploring the nature of the human experience, and (according to Waters) "empathy".

* "Speak to Me" and "Breathe" together stress the mundane and futile elements of life that accompany the ever-present threat of madness, and the importance of living one's own life  "Don't be afraid to care".

* By shifting the scene to an airport, the synthesizer-driven instrumental "On the Run" evokes the stress and anxiety of modern travel, in particular Wright's fear of flying.

* "Time" examines the manner in which its passage can control one's life and offers a stark warning to those who remain focused on mundane aspects; it is followed by a retreat into solitude and withdrawal in "Breathe (Reprise)". 

* The first side of the album ends with Wright and vocalist Clare Torry's soulful metaphor for death, "The Great Gig in the Sky".

* Opening with the sound of cash registers and loose change, the first track on side two, "Money", mocks greed and consumerism using tongue-in-cheek lyrics and cash-related sound effects (ironically, "Money" has been the most commercially successful track from the album, with several cover versions produced by other bands).

* "Us and Them" addresses the isolation of the depressed with the symbolism of conflict and the use of simple dichotomies to describe personal relationships.

* "Any Colour You Like" concerns the lack of choice one has in a human society.

* "Brain Damage" looks at a mental illness resulting from the elevation of fame and success above the needs of the self; in particular, the line "and if the band you're in starts playing different tunes" reflects the mental breakdown of former bandmate Syd Barrett.

* The album ends with "Eclipse", which espouses the concepts of alterity and unity, while forcing the listener to recognise the common traits shared by humanity." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone has a journey they wish to travel, a goal to complete. For me, in NMS anyway, my goal is to find an 8 or 9 planet system which I can call my own and settle down in. Now, Ive yet to come across such a system; the maximum Ive seen so far is 6 planets, but I am assured of systems with more thanks to /u/jive495 and [their comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/4yiyiz/how_many_planets_can_a_system_have/d6odrfx?context=3) on an earlier question I had.


You may be wondering why Im searching for such a system. The answer is simple: Im looking for a system which I can name in parallel to our own system. Not the names verbatim, you understand, but the counterpart names of the Greek and Roman mythological deities which our system and planets are named after. Ive always thought this would be a cool thing to do, and now NMS appears to cater to this. The names that the system and planets are to take are:


* The **Iliosar** System, from the Greek word **Ilios**, meaning star, just like **Solar** comes from **Sol**, the Latin word for star.


* The closest planet to the star of the system will be **Hermes**, the Greek counterpart to the Roman **Mercury**, God of Commerce.


* After Hermes comes **Aphrodite**, the Greek counterpart of the Roman **Venus**, Goddess of Love.


* Then we have **Gaierra**, which is a unique case as **Earth** is the only planet not named after a deity, so the best choice is to name this planet with a fusion of both respective relevant deities, those being the Greek **Gaia** and the Roman **Terra**, both Goddesses of the Earth.


* Next up, we have **Ares**, the Greek counterpart to the Roman **Mars**, God of War.


* Following Ares, we have **Zeus**, the Greek counterpart to the Roman **Jupiter**, King of the Gods.


* Then we have **Cronus**, the Greek counterpart to the Roman **Saturn**, Titan of Capitol.


* After Cronus comes **Caelus**, the Roman (yes, ROMAN) counterpart to the Greek **Uranus**, God of the Sky.


* Up next is the predictable Greek **Poseidon**, taking the place of its Roman counterpart **Neptune**, God of the Sea.


* Finally (and optionally), we have **Dis Pater**, the Roman counterpart of the Greek deity **Pluto**, Ruler of the Underworld. Yes, **Pluto** is Greek, not Roman, as is widely believed. **Pluto** is the Latinized form of the Greek **Plouton**, from which it is believed that **Dis Pater** is translated from. Look it up.


If and when I achieve this goal, I will let you all know, so that you may attempt to find it if you so wish.

And one more thing: should you find any of my previous discoveries from my meandering through the galaxy, you'll know they're mine if you scan them and it says "Discovered by **ByteBasher**", as **ByteBasher** is my PS4 username. Feel free to add me if you want.


See you among the stars, travellers. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last night, I went crashed-ship hunting on a barren Korvax planet to find a new ship that looked better than my current Gek ship but with the same health (8).

I find a few, hop in each of them to find out the health, then I hop out and do what I need to do (transfer resources or fly to the next ship).

Soon, I find a Korvax ship with the same health, so I get in to see the health, hop out again, the game saves...and the game crashes. I reload the game (PS4, btw) and find that my Gek ship with all 40 of my full resource stacks has disappeared.

So, now I'm currently stuck on a dead planet with a crappy-looking ship that has broken Launch Thrusters and Pulse Engine and I'm excited beyond words.

THIS is the experience I was waiting for; stranded on a barren planet with a broken ship, minimal resources, no sign of life for miles, extreme weather (must be glitched, because it's hot and cold at the same time), minimal protection and a nothing but the infinite cosmos above me. The challenge excites me. This is what the legendary stories are made of.

Ladies, gentlemen, Korvax, Gek and Vy'keen alike, I shall see you at the center.

Or maybe not. </TEXT>

For those interested, the page states "As an example, a Mister Handy torso and thruster assembly including a Tesla field and three buzzsaw-equipped appendages, combined with sentry bot arms wielding Gatling lasers and decked out in voltaic armor plating, results in an automatron that can single-handedly massacre entire hostile strongholds at range without needing ammunition, will devastate almost anything foolish enough to enter melee range, can move at impressive speed, can carry more than most organic companions, and is small enough to accompany its master everywhere." </TEXT>

But the important thing to note is that I'm not pushing this as fact. At best, I'm trying to explain the chills I feel as best as I can when I watch this scene.

I appreciate the input with the facts, but I say "wishful thinking" in the first sentence. I know it'll never be the way I've outlined it here, but a man can dream, can't he?

Who knows? If multiverse theory is indeed correct, that means there's got to be a few universes out there where this actually happened. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Headcanon] Day Of The Doctor - Curator Scene </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-05 04:18:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know its only wishful thinking, but thats why its headcanon, right? Anyway, heres my headcanon about the curator scene at the end of Day Of The Doctor.


Its the first take of filming the curator scene.


While Matt is talking to himself, saying I could retire and be the curator of this place., hes waiting for the next line off-screen said by someone else. Hes expecting someone who looks suspiciously like the Doctor. As Paul McGann was attached to do Night Of The Doctor, the writers probably brought him in to do the table reads for that scene and telling Matt that hell have prosthetics or something to make him appear older on screen, and that Matt will have to look shocked when he hears his voice. So, Matts waiting for Paul to speak.


But he doesnt.


You know, I really think you might.


Matt freezes up. His expression goes from smiling to absolute, genuine shock. He knows that voice. Any Doctor Who fan worth their salt knows that voice. He turns to look at whos speaking and cant believe his eyes. He gets up and walks over to meet them face-to-face. Matt is in genuine awe at the fact that hes acting opposite Tom Baker himself. For a moment, hes a little kid again, visions of blue boxes and long scarves dancing in his dreams.


Then the real world hits him. Hes an actor, so he has to act. He has to say the words hes rehearsed a hundred times over. But does he say them as the Doctor or as Matt Smith?


I never forget a face.


The scene proceeds as written, Matt barely restraining himself from outright gushing and fangirling over his predecessor. And at the end, after Tom walks off-screen, Matt looks at the camera, crosses his arms and smiles. As the Doctor, this says that he's happy his journey isn't over. But as Matt, he's saying "Take that.", trying to look smug.


And it's because of this headcanon that I'll never not have chills when I watch that scene again and again. </TEXT>

If every planet in No Man's Sky was sequentially named using the letters of the alphabet (A, AB, BA, ABC, ACB, BCA, BAC, CAB, CBA, etc.), you would need every combination of A through to T plus roughly 31.343798694713145830399% of all combinations of A through to U to name all of the planets with a unique combination without repetition of sequence or double letters.

Additionally, the average human genome (the genetic material of an organism), when visually sequenced, is roughly 3.2 billion letters long. If every planet in NMS was assigned one of the four specific letters that are used in genome sequencing (A, G, C, T), there would be enough letters to sequence the genomes of over 5.75 billion people, or roughly the population of Earth in 1996. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-07-12 03:46:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Lets look at the facts.


His grandfather, Anakin Skywalker, was considered one of the greatest pilots around. He was the only human podracer due to being Force-sensitive, blew up a Trade Federation battleship at a young age and displayed his talent for flying through a war zone to save Chancellor Palpatine only to safely crash-land a half-destroyed dreadnought onto Coruscant. As Kylo is a Vader fanatic, theres a chance that, in order to be greater than Vader, he would continuously hone his flying skills.


His uncle, Luke Skywalker, also became somewhat of a prestigious pilot after he helped destroy the first Death Star. He avoided cannon fire, TIE Fighters and even his own father to, without guidance equipment but by way of the Force, launch the photon torpedoes at exactly the right time into the vent that caused the chain reaction to blow it up. Sure, he got shot down during the Battle of Hoth, but he displayed aptitude on a speeder bike during the Battle of Endor. Luke probably told him the story about the first Death Star which may or may not have given him the drive to try and do something just as prestigious as his mentor.


Then you have his father, the legendary smuggler and celebrated pilot Han Solo, Corellian captain of the Millennium Falcon. Corellians are known for being reckless and daring alongside being considered fantastic pilots, and theres a saying that Corellians have rocket fuel for blood. No doubt Han would have trained Kylo back when he was still Ben Solo to assist in flying the Falcon at a young age.


**Kylo Ren is a half-Corellian, Force-sensitive human with great pilots in his lineage, was most likely taught by Han Solo to fly, possesses a drive to be better than his grandfather and his mentor AND there seems to be a hint of both respect and mocking when he interrogates Poe Dameron and says I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board as though hes really saying Youre a good pilot, but not as good as me.**


*Please, God; give us a dogfight between Poe and Kylo in the upcoming episodes.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with this statement, albeit it in a small capacity.

Yes, I can understand that the high volume of these types of par-for-the-course jokes can be a bit much for the relevant audience, but it is up to said audience to speak up as to whether or not they believe that the trio should cut back on these jokes.

Such feedback might be achieved through their Twitter accounts, here on the Hat Films and Yogscast Reddits, in the comments of the offending videos and meeting them face-to-face at conventions.

The fact is that, until a noticeable amount of people complain about the jokes the trio make, there's a good chance that they'll keep going with those jokes.

And that's all I have to say on the matter. Good day, one and all.

~~Also, I may or may not be excited to see the end of Hat Films culminate into one big dick joke as they've said in the past.~~ </TEXT>

These days, if you see an Arceus in online battles come out of a PokeBall that's not a Cherish Ball, there's a high chance it's hacked, but legitimate different PokeBall Arceus do exist, but it's hard to know which ones are the genuine articles. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Do you think THIS person will show up in Fantastic Beasts? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-01 09:00:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Let's look at the facts.

Where is Fantastic Beasts set? **New York.**

When is Fantastic Beasts set? **1926.**

New York, 1926. When you think of famous people in that area at that time, most especially when you think about people being called and considered wizards and doing things that the general public think are extraordinary or downright impossible, who do you think of?

The biggest name that comes to mind is none other than **NIKOLA TESLA.** A man considered a wizard with the incredible energy of electricity who was living in New York in 1926, Tesla would be a prime candidate for showing up in Fantastic Beasts. We could see him included in any conceivable way, from a simple nameplate on a door in the MACUSA to seeing the elderly Tesla (he turned 70 in July, 1926) battling it out with one of the escaped creatures from Newt's case.

Now, I could have also said Thomas Edison here as well; aside from the obvious title of "The Wizard Of Menlo Park", there is a chance he would have been in New York in 1926, but a full appearance might not be likely as he was known to frequent Florida in the mid-1920's. To that extent, there could also be a door with a nameplate that says "Thomas A. Edison" on it; there could even be a small scene showing a door with both Edison and Tesla's names on it, ironically subverting the famous War of Currents between them.

**What do you think? Could there be a nod to Tesla or Edison in Fantastic Beasts? Might they show up in the sequels? Who else famous was known to be in New York in 1926? Leave your thoughts below.** </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There's over 730 Pokemon in the Pokemon world, so it's inevitable that a number of Pokemon are going to take a seat on the bench...and maybe never get off of it.

I'm talking about Pokemon you've probably forgotten exist. I'm talking about the Pokemon that, when you hear their name, you're like "Oh, right! Completely forgot that was totally a thing!"


So which Pokemon do you always forget about for one reason or another? For me, it has to be **Maractus** because there's barely any exposure on it. Seriously; when's the last time you saw a Maractus in the Pokemon world that wasn't the one you caught and stored in your PC for collection and completion purposes?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I moved house earlier this month and came across this watch while going through an old chest of drawers. It was a present from my Dad to my Mum on her 21st Birthday back in 1979.

Here is a front and back view of the watch:  http://imgur.com/m5GnYVw 

The writing on the face says "OMEGA - DE VILLE - QUARTZ - SWISS MADE" (sorry about the quality) and the inscription on the back reads "To Rita, Happy 21st, Love Todd 8.10.79"

So it's a late 70's Omega De Ville and that's about all I know. I don't know much about watches and my searching efforts on the internet turned up nothing conclusive.

Any information regarding the specifics about this watch would be much appreciated. Cheers in advance. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What Pokemon do you always lead with? What's its story? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-28 05:59:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm just curious to know the stories and love behind your most used Pokemon. In case you're a bit confused, here's my story.

I've been a fan of Pokemon since the early 2000's. My friend loaned me his Game Boy Color and Pokemon Silver and the rest is history.

Anyway, I didn't actually own a Pokemon game of my own until Pokemon Pearl was released in 2007. I started the game and got my starter and went out into the new world.

The first Pokemon I come across? A simple Starly. I catch it and name him 'Soarateryx' (From 'soar' as it's a bird Pokemon, a corruption of the word 'sora' which translates to 'sky' and 'archeopteryx' as it was MY first bird Pokemon ). It quickly became a staple of my team, and I trained it...maybe not as best as I could, but I trained it in a way that felt right (I'm an exhibitionist, not a competitor).

Fast forward to now. Every chance I've had to transfer Soarateryx over, I've done so. In the 9 years since that first encounter, he's seen 6 regions across 15 games (counting different versions) and has ALWAYS been the Pokemon I lead with. Pokemon Amie was a godsend, as it allowed me to bond with him at an unprecedented level. I will never not have him in my party as we've been through so, so much together and he will be my companion until the day I die...or until my game gets corrupted.

Anyway, that's my story in a nutshell. **What's yours?** </TEXT>

In the case of the Baychimo, makes sense that you might not have heard of it. It was more of a thing in the late 30's and faded into obscurity after that. It still pops up on lists of ghost ships on the Internet from time to time, though. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Where is the SS Baychimo? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-06 07:04:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> All right, heres the short version.


The SS Baychimo was a cargo steamer that disappeared off the northern coasts of Alaska in 1931 and was sighted and boarded multiple times between 1931 and 1969, though some sightings are debatable. Since its disappearance, it has been dubbed The Ghost Ship of the Arctic. (For more information, read Anthony Daltons Baychimo: Arctic Ghost Ship.)


In 2006, the Alaskan Government commissioned a project to search for the Baychimo, but their efforts turned up no results. To this day, it hasnt been found. It has been 10 years since the search for a ship that is now over 100 years old.


So, the big question: where is the SS Baychimo? Technology and oceanography has come quite a way in ten years, so how difficult would it be to find it? Lets be realistic: as well built as the Baychimo was, theres a snowballs chance in hell that its still afloat to this day, meaning that its sitting on the ocean floor somewhere. Im sure that theres a number of environmental and legal factors to consider, considering the amount of ice in the waters where it disappeared from and the jurisdiction of those waters, but persistence and perseverance have proved fruitful in the past; just look at the search for the HMS Erebus over history.


Isnt anyone else curious about this odd ships fate? Have people lost interest? Or are people just saying let it be regarding one of, if not the last of the legitimate ghost ships on the planet? </TEXT>

<TEXT> One: they're not actually mine. I saw them on DeviantArt and posted their links here for the Pokemon Reddit community to see.

Two: I don't think they had a choice. The Pokemon were already there across several eyecatches, so they just composited them onto one another. They cite the [Bulbapedia Location Previews](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Location_preview) as their source material.

Three: If you have a DA account, show them the love over on the pictures instead of here. We don't know if the artist frequents Reddit, so give praise at the source. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All right, here's the deal. When I started up Far Harbor on PS4, I didn't do quests immediately; I walked around the island, found locations and explored them as much as possible.

So, I come across the Vim! Pop Factory. More specifically, the KYE facility underneath the factory in the basement. I thought I had raided it of all its plunder and left to explore the island and complete quests.

I complete the main storyline and jump onto the Fallout and Fallout 4 reddit pages to see if there's anything I missed and, lo and behold, I missed the legendary weapon in the facility, so I went back to grab it...only to find the door was locked with no way to open it.

So, I search the internet for help and found that a combination of two methods would let me get it: the Power Armor clip glitch and the waste basket levitation glitch.

I've met a bitchy kid called Small Bertha.

A long time ago, near the start of my second playthrough, I found a legendary Explosive Combat Shotgun which I named Kleine Bertha, where 'Kleine' is German for 'Small'. And now the two have met.

<TEXT> Ginyu is a pun on gyny, the Japanese word for dairy milk.

Guldo's Japanese name is Gurudo, which is derived from yguruto, the Japanese word for yogurt.

Recoome's Japaense name is Rikmu, a rearranging of the word krimu, the Japanese word for cream.

Burter is indeed from butter. Top marks.

Jeice comes from Jisu, which in turn is a derivative of chizu, which is cheese.

So, the Ginyu Force is Dairy Milk, Yogurt, Cream, Butter and Cheese. </TEXT>

The three primary colours are Red, Blue and Yellow. The three secondary colours are Green, Orange and Purple.


Ginyu is purple. Recoome has orange hair. Guldo is green. Jeice is red. Burter is blue. No-one yellow is included.


Theory: there used to be a sixth yellow member of the Ginyu Force. I think he would have been bigger than Burter, have a nickname like Yellow Earthquake (to compliment Blue Hurricane and Red Magma) and be called something like Jarto (derived from "gerato", Japanese for "gelato").

<TITLE> Nuka-Cola Variant Ideas </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-26 04:15:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My friend and I are avid Fallout fans, and we like all the different variants of Nuka-Cola that have cropped up throughout the games (yep, even THAT one), so we decided to come up with a few ourselves. Why not treat yourself to a cold...


**NUKA-COLA SUNSET**

Sunset Sarsaparilla and Nuka-Cola have held an amiable truce with each other since the earliest days of our company. Therefore, both companies have considered now to be the appropriate time to collaborate on a new variant: Nuka-Cola SUNSET!*

This yellow-labelled mixture combines the classic taste of Nuka-Cola with the vanilla-liquorice-tinted fizziness of Sunset Sarsaparilla to create a taste and feel that one can only describe as unifying!

Nuka-Cola Sunset: United We Brew, Divided We Drink!**

(*Nuka-Cola Sunset is labelled in the Western States as Sunset Cola.)

(**Limited Edition.)



**NUKA-COLA DYNAMITE**

That massive caffeine hit just not doing it for you? Straight from Mexico, it's Nuka-Cola DYNAMITE! The great taste you know and love with a new addition: extreme chili! That's right; one swig of this luminescent red brew will give you enough energy to build a house, paint the fence, fix the car, mow the lawn and go for a 20 mile run...all in one day! 

Nuka-Cola Dynamite: When Too Much Is Never Enough!*

(*Excessive consumption of this product may cause rashes, swelling, itching, temporary psychosis and heart palpitations. Consult a doctor before use.)



**NUKA-COLA PATRIOT**

Its not a proper party until theres Nuka-Cola! But, even then, Nuka-Cola can only provide so much fun, which is why we are proud to announce the new Nuka-Cola PATRIOT to our range of variants!

The new Patriot is an adult-only alcoholic Nuka-Cola that comes in a variety of different mixes, including, but not limited to Scotch, Vodka, Whiskey, Tequila and Moonshine just to name a few!

Nuka-Cola Patriot: A Soft Drink For A Hard Party!*

(*Excessive consumption will lead to alcohol poisoning. Nuka-Cola does not condone the excessive consumption alcohol and has released this product in the hopes that it will be enjoyed responsibly.)



**NUKA-COLA FREEDOM**

Our soldiers are out there, citizens; it's a harsh fight, and our American troops in Power Armor need all the help they can get. Support the war effort directly today with Nuka Cola FREEDOM! No need to convince anyone you're rooting for the War effort; show your bottle of Nuka Cola Freedom and everyone will see you for the patriot you are. Fight the Reds from your very home!

Nuka-Cola Freedom: For The Liberator In You!*

(*Nuka-Cola would like to remind consumers that, while supporting the Army is a worthy cause, it does not condone or encourage the public to resort to violence to do so, hence the creation of this promotion.)



**NUKA-COLA CUPID**

We at Nuka-Cola encourage companionship in times of crisis. So, in time for Valentines Day, we have decided to bring out Nuka-Cola CUPID!

Give one of these glowing pink brews (with custom naming, no less) to your significant other or lifelong crush to show them that youre thinking of them. What could be more romantic than sharing a bottle of Nuka-Cola with the love of your life while watching the sun go down?

Nuka-Cola Cupid: Loneliness Is Not Forever!*

(*Limited Edition. Nuka-Cola would also like to iterate that Nuka-Cola Cupid is not to be considered a love potion, nor is Nuka-Cola responsible for restraining orders and marital problems that may arise through the sale and distribution of Nuka-Cola Cupid.)



**NUKA-COLA PLASMA**

Need a little pizazz in your soft drink? Love the trademark taste of an ice cold Nuka Cola, but want a little more zing?

Have a blast with Nuka-Cola PLASMA! With the announcement RobCo's new joint project in Plasma Weaponry, we at Nuka-Cola wanted to bring you all the Zip, Pop and Whoosh of these extraordinary tools in your favourite drink! To achieve this, weve added a small, safely-consumable amount of the newly-patented Plasma liquid ammunition to our classic Nuka-Cola and shaken it up a bit! For those of us that just need some extra get up and go, get critical with Nuka-Cola Plasma!

Nuka-Cola Plasma: Straight From The Future!*

(*Limited edition. Nuka-Cola holds no responsibility for liquefied oesophaguses or stomachs, or total disintegration brought on by excessive consumption. Consult a doctor before use.)



**NUKA-COLA TROPICAL**

Tired of your office cubicle? House life got you feeling like you're in jail? Do you need a quick and easy escape? Enjoy your life...by not being there at all!

Our southern offices have been working around the clock so that YOU can try the NEW Nuka-Cola TROPICALl! One green sip of our patented Melon Burst recipe and you'll be whisked away to a golden beach in Hawaii or a cruise ship in the Caribbean!

Let your mind float away from your body as you envision yourself far, far away from where you'd rather not be, with a smile on your face and the refreshing exotic taste of melon on your lips!

Nuka-Cola Tropical: Paradise Is Just A Drink Away!*

(*Excessive consumption may result in a temporary fugue state, accompanied by incoherent mumbling and moderate drooling.) 



**NUKA-COLA BAYCHIMO**

It's a story that's delighted hunters for over 130 years, and now we're taking a leaf out of its history. A special promotion to YOU, from us at Nuka-Cola, we have come up with Nuka-Cola BAYCHIMO!

As a parallel to the sparse, rare sightings of the Ghost Ship of the Arctic, Nuka-Cola is releasing 5 (count them) bottles of Nuka-Cola Baychimo* among our seemingly-infinite supplies of Nuka-Cola in order to give 5 lucky consumers an executive VIP tour of the Nuka-Cola factory, culminating in a brainstorm session to determine what flavour and theme Nuka-Cola will be releasing next!

Nuka-Cola Baychimo: Every Story Has An End!**

(*Limited Edition. Bottles of Nuka-Cola Baychimo appear as a standard bottle of Nuka-Cola, but with the subtitle 'Baychimo' underneath written in smaller text under the title.)

(**Promotion ends August 31, 2077. Executive tour to take place October 23, 2077. This promotion will not be repeated.)



**NUKA-COLA PHANTASM**

Heads up, Nuka-Cola drinkers! Halloween is just around the corner and have we got the beverage for you!

Excited to gaily roam the streets on October 31 but don't have a costume prepared? With the new and extremely limited Nuka-Cola PHANTASM, you don't need a costume to fright and delight!
Our scientists have slaved over a hot Petri dish to synthesize a consumption-safe variant of the GFP gene found in jellyfish to put in America's favourite cola drink!

"What does all that mean?" I hear you ask! Simple! Upon consuming the bright yellow Phantasm concoction, your skin will glow varying shades of white, yellow and green for up to four whole hours! Plenty of time to get your trick-or-treating in!

With your skin glowing, all you need is a ghoul-like moan and voila! From no costume to a ghost version of yourself in no time! Happy Halloween!

Nuka-Cola Phantasm: Unleash The Freak!*

(*Limited edition. Excessive consumption may cause irreparable genome damage, including permanently glowing skin, and renal failure. Limit of one per customer per purchase.)

<TEXT> Upon the announcement of Pokemon Sun and Moon, I found myself thinking about which types and what genders the Gyms, Elite Four and Champion might have. So, I compiled a table of the most commonly used types, what each specialist was and the genders of those specialists. Then, I went through and compiled a wishlist of the most under-represented of each type, specialist and gender, which you shall see below, along with my reasoning. So, in some semblance of order:

**GYM LEADERS**

1) Poison-type Male (part of a 4-way tie of the second-most under-represented types and there have been more female than male Poison specialists)

2) Ground-type Female (part of a 4-way tie of the second-most under-represented types and there have been more male than female Ground specialists)

3) Dragon-type Male (while part of a 3-way tie in second-most represented type and equal amounts of gender use, there have been half the amount of Dragon Gym Leaders than there have been Elite Four and Champions combined. Plus, I thought Drayden was awesome.)

4) Ghost-type Male (less Gym Leaders than Elite Four members and a 3:1 ratio of females to males #TeamMorty)

5) Dark-type Female (this type hasn't had a Gym yet and there have been more male Dark specialists than female)

6) Steel-type Female (part of a 5-way tie of the third-most under-represented types with an equal position split but with 3 male Steel specialists to 1 female specialist)

7) Flying-type Male (part of a 4-way tie of the second-most under-represented type, I know that all Flying specialists have been Gym Leaders but I wanted to give certain types a chance in the Elite Four, and there has only been 1 male specialist while the other 2 have been female)

8) Fire-type Female (a pretty average represented type with more Gyms than Elite Four, but with 3 male specialists compared to 2 female specialists)

**ELITE FOUR**

1) Rock-type Female (part of a 5-way tie of the third-most under-represented types where all specialists have been Gym Leaders and a ratio of 3 male to 1 female)

2) Electric-type Female (a pretty average represented type where all specialists have been Gym Leaders and a ratio of 4 male to 1 female)

3) Grass-type Male (part of a 5-way tie of the third-most under-represented types where all specialists have been Gym Leaders with an equal gender split)

4) Normal-type Male (Often seen as the worst type due to it not being super-effective against anything I thought I'd give it a chance in the EF as part of a 4-way tie of the second-most under-represented type with 4 Gym Leaders and an equal gender split)

**CHAMPION**

1) Fairy-type Male (Sexuality arguments aside, the Fairy type has had one Gym Leader which has been Female and needs a little more love in the specialist line-up) </TEXT>

<TEXT> How odd. It's not removed on my end. In any case, I'll repeat it here.

"I've been crunching a few numbers about this game to find a condensed way to wrap my head around how massive NMS is.

Here's what I've got (text wall incoming):

**ONE**

Grab your average 30cm ruler. Now, in your minds eye, picture a cube that's 29cm X 29cm X 29cm. Pretty easy, right?

But, wait; there's more. In your mind, segment the cube into 1cm blocks, so it looks like those big wooden blocks you used in school for counting.

Now imagine each one of those individual blocks is Planet Earth. That's right; imagine a cube of over 24,000 Planet Earths.

The population of Earth at the moment clocks in at about 7.4 billion. A lot of people, right? That's not the end, though; the average number of hairs on the human head is around 100,000. So, imagine all the people on all the Earths in your cube had 100,000 hairs on all of their heads.

Now for the math.

100,000 hairs X 7.4 billion people = 740 trillion (740 followed by 12 zeroes) hairs on one Planet. 740 trillion hairs X 24,389 Planet Earths (the number of planets in your cube) = 18,047,860,000,000,000,000 (18 quintillion, 47 quadrillion, 860 trillion) hairs on the heads of the combined people in your cube of Earths.

And that's STILL not enough to equal the amount of planets in NMS!

**TWO**

The estimated age of Planet Earth is 4.543 billion years old.

If Day One of Earth was Day One of No Man's Sky, and one planet was discovered every second in NMS, right now roughly 0.77% of the planets in NMS would have been discovered.

**THREE**

There's roughly 18.5 quintillion planets in No Man's Sky.

Hello Games believe that, over the course of the game, 99.9% of these planets will go undiscovered, which equals to about 18.5 quadrillion planets feasibly being discovered during the game's life-span.

**FOUR**

Remember those wood or plastic 1 centimetre cubes you used in primary school for maths?

Well, if one of those cubes was one planet in NMS, and you wanted a cubic representation of how many planets there are in NMS using them, the finished product would be a cube with sides almost 26.5 kilometres long.

**FIVE**

One spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel 2016 has 17,179,869,184 total cells. If you were to use Microsoft Excel 2016 to compile a database of the names of every planet in No Man's Sky with one name per cell, you would need exactly 1,073,741,824 complete spreadsheets to list them all." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally, I think Ross has excellent taste is music. Take his love of Arthur Brown, for example; how many times has he tweeted about Arthur Brown (and more specifically the iconic song "Fire")?

It's great that even the young ones (I know he's not really 'young', per se) keep on respecting the classics of yesteryear. But here's my opinion; the work of Arthur Brown feels a lot like the work of Hat Films.

Example: [THIS](http://www.soundstation.dk/images/products/large/33/135133-b.jpg) is the album cover for "Galactic Zoo Dossier" by Arthur Brown's Kingdom Come from 1970. Read closely; doesn't it seem like one of the kinds of covers that the boys would put out? Also, [THIS] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o6hQKsX7R4) is the song "Gypsy Escape" from the album and (to me) sounds like the crazy, erratic stuff that we love hearing from the Sirs; imagine if you will, Smith doing the guitar/s, Trott on the keyboard and Ross on the drums (but done on a keyboard, too).

Seriously though, Ross: good taste in music you've got. </TEXT>

Imagine, if you will, the Sirs compiling a list of phrases of their own choosing in different languages, then proceeding to say those phrases in accents that sound wrong for the language.

Example: Smith saying "Guten Morgan meine Freunde" (German: Good morning, my friends.) in an over-the-top Australian accent. The mental image of that gets me chucking every time.

Here's my two cents; Crazy Pills! They're a consumable item that induce a sort of berserk state at the cost of other faculties, like a temporary Attack boost for a certain number of turns but enemy attacks do more damage for the same time.

<TITLE> [OPINION] I've figured it out </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-29 13:21:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Guys and girls, I think I've finally figured out just what Alsmiffy's Minecraft avatar is.

Now, stay with me as this might not be the conclusion you're expecting, but I think it's...

...A HUMANOID CLUMP OF SENTIENT SEAWEED.

Weird, eh? But it fits, I assure you. Let's look at the facts:

Smith is salty. I mean REALLY salty; if you combined all of the salt in all the salt mines of Russia, you'd maybe have an arm of Smith.

Now, the avatar of Alsmiffy is green; it's not all the same shade, however, as you can see there a few different shades of green used as a gradient.

Thirdly, the avatar has no discernible mouth, meaning that it can't speak or feed itself with the standard food you and I eat.

Let's look at the similarities here:

1. Have you ever tasted seaweed? Depending on the variety and application, it can have a lot of different flavours. But if you were to take it straight from the ocean and tasted it (you weirdo), it would be incredibly salty as you just picked it out of the saltwater ocean.

2. Like the flavour, the colour of seaweed can come in different varieties: for the purpose of this, I'm focusing on mainly the green-coloured variations of seaweed, within which are several shades of green not dissimilar from the greens on the avatar.

3. Seaweed can't speak. No duh, right? But what about food? That's simple: seaweed is a plant and derives its food and energy from the sun via photosynthesis and plants don't need a mouth for that.

Still with me?

"But what about his eyes?", you may ask, to which I'd respond "You have me over a barrel there." But I ask you "What evidence is there that the eyes are functional?" I mean, for all we know, those are just a couple of squid eyes picked up from a dead specimen on a beach somewhere and shoved into what constitutes the head to give the appearance of a normal-ish humanoid being.

"And the suit? Why the suit?" Well, that's easy. A big clump of tendrils is just a clump unless molded into a semi-permanent shape and THAT'S why the suit: to give the clump the shape we know and fear.

"And the predilection with fire as shown in many a well-drawn fan art?" ...that's just Smith in general. If you want to go ahead and imagine the personality of Smith resides in the seaweed, go ahead: I, for one, can't comment on what ANY plant is thinking, so the interpretation is up to you.

"And just how did the seaweed become sentient in the first place?" HOW SHOULD I KNOW? It's fantasy, people: make something up!

"And the backstory of how it-" Enough, all right? If you like my theory, make up your own freaking story.

So, let's recap: salty, green and doesn't eat with a mouth (and MAYBE doesn't know what it's doing half the time...maybe MOST of the time, but that's Smith for you). There aren't many things that have those same key points and seaweed is at the top of my list (above the super-strain of watermelon watered with saline solution).

What do you think? Like the title says, this is purely an opinion: whether you agree or disagree is none of my business. I just want to get this out of my head because I forgot it.


From the middle of nowhere in the arse end of the world, I'm subject7374. Good day. </TEXT>
