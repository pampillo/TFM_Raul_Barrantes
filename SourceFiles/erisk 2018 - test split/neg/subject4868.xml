<TEXT> This is going to boil your blood. Just hours ago, the Democrats won their lawsuit to extend voter registration in Georgia before our election, she wrote in the email. This lawsuit should be seen for exactly what it is: A partisan attempt to change the rules in the middle of an election for a nakedly partisan outcome.

Handel knows she's outnumbered and her ideas are outnumbered. Her only hope is that less people vote. And that's not democracy, that's partisan politics. </TEXT>

And that there's no way the Russia links could actually be true, considering that most of Trumps financing during the last decade has actually come from Russian interests which themselves are thinly veiled Russian state actors. But Occam's Razor states the simplest explanation must be true. If Trump doesn't know the truth about his own Russian ties, it's because he's truly that naive. </TEXT>

Responsible corporations would have to recall the entirety of their lot of contaminated product and eat the costs, despite their expenses.

<TEXT> That's true. But when you add the repeated stress of being fully responsible for another human, some people will. And that's why this guy shouldn't have had a kid either foster or adopted. And it's clear you have no kids. Because if you did, you'd understand the ever-present vigilance that parents have for the welfare and safety of our children. I'm saying, this guy didn't have that. If the child was his biologically, and he helped raise him from birth, there's a good chance he wouldn't have done this. It's because that process changes people.

There's a question on most personality tests which asks, "Aren't babies incredibly special?"  If you answer anything other than yes, you don't have your own kids. It's simple and precise and those who don't have kids understand it. And that's the core of this issue. This guy shouldn't have been allowed to adopt. He wasn't mentally prepared to be a father. If he had raised his own kids, or even raised this one from a baby, he probably would have been better equipped to handle the situation. My kid has acted out at school. I didn't do any of those terrible things. I took away his laptop. It's a lifetime of learning for a parent. What this guy did is indefensible. And I'm not defending him. I'm saying adoption agencies need to do a better job of vetting potential parents. Because they let this one slip through, a child is dead. And this guy is entirely at fault for his actions which resulted in the child's death. But the adoption agency also bears some responsibility for placing a child in a home with an unstable individual. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's because people tend not to read multi-line comments. They try to get the gist from the first line and run with it. Yes this guy was very messed up and never should have tried to become a father. And I'm also saying as a reply to the parent question, being a father is a process. One which this guy didn't go through. Biology is pretty weird when it comes to fathers and babies. Our instincts are the only thing that allowed us to survive as a species to get to the point where love took over. Today, instincts still play a role. But there is a certain subset of men for which their instincts are broken, never take place, or something else is damaged within them. So they never imprint with a child. Mothers usually imprint within a few weeks but they have a head start. And for some postpartum depression blocks that. So when asking why would someone do this? There's the answers. I'm not defending a monster. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Being a father is a process. A lot of us guys don't tend to have a lot of patience to begin with. Caring for a newborn and then a toddler changes you. I grew new patience like I'd never dreamed of. Instincts kick in.  For a guy who probably had little patience to begin, he just wasn't prepared to be a father. The severity of his actions prove he should never have tried to adopt a child. He belongs in jail. And I'm a guy who was primary caregiver for my two kids from 4 months onto seven years of age. I have way more patience than I used to, but I have the instinct to protect my children at all costs, something this guy lacks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, you really misunderstand. This subsidy wasn't for customers to pay premiums. It was more like a kickback to the insurance companies to charge less money for premiums. In the same way that farmers are paid a subsidy to grow corn. You, the customer, don't get money from the government to buy corn. so, when those subsidies (kickbacks) didn't come through, the price of premiums went up. Do you understand now?

And unless you're willing to pay for the babies, stop demanding that women can't choose what they want to do with their own bodies. I am not wrong. You are just confused by religious beliefs. And unless you are out there rescuing all life from harm and death, you are a cherry picking hypocrite. Next time a spider falls into your bathtub while you are showering and you decide not to rescue it, think deeply about why you feel that only humans are deserving of your protection. And unless a fetus is inside of your body, stop making decisions which impact other humans. You don't get to decide what other people do. Free will doesn't require your consent. And finally, an infant is not sentient. Go back to school and learn science. Don't use buzzwords for which you don't understand the actual concepts. </TEXT>

This is a fallacy. Yes, if heroic measures are taken and extremely expensive procedures are made, a 22-24 week preemie could potentially survive. An infant has already passed through the birth canal. That "magic" is called medical science. And you are so far below it in your rhetoric, it's damn near criminal. Life is defined at separation.

<TEXT> They feel the line has always been, corporate taxes are too high. And you should remove them to 'stimulate business'. And you're right, that money ends up as profits hidden in offshore accounts. It doesn't trickle down. Trickle down was always complete nonsense. And there's never been any proof that any of it works. Corporations usually spend other peoples' money. I say the tax rate is too low. When GE can outsource profits and domesticate losses and still get a billion dollar tax refund, the system is definitely broken, but not in the way they'd have you believe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But they also see people like Bezos and Zuckerberg. It's the phenomenon of Shark Tank syndrome. Everyone believes if they start a business, they will become rich. But still the wealthy benefit from startups that succeed and fail. The wealthy always win because the people believe it's possible. But it's not possible without the wealthy. If you all remember the "you didn't build it" nonsense in 2012, it's that. Every step along the way, I can point out how someone didn't build it alone. You always need someone else's money. Trump would have you believe that he built an empire from the ground up. He "worked" hard, had a dream. And 40 million of his father's money.

Even Zuckerberg would still be sitting in a dorm room somewhere if he didn't have investors, which he screwed over.

The American dream was snatched away by corporations. Their purpose is only to make profit. And some of the people along the way decide that profit is the only motivator. American workers cost too much, let's hire cheaper workers over seas. Product safety costs too much, let's skip the safe materials. Benefits cost too much, let's lay off our workforce and contract it out. All of these poor people are taking too much benefit from the state, let's take away their benefits. All these regulations are costing us profits, let's do away with them.

American corporations took away jobs. Then they took away benefits. Then they took away our representation. Now they want to take away our protections. And next is the restrictions preventing them from open free range fascism.

There are few who can be convinced on the ideas. For the rest, there's personal attacks on political opponents. There's always going to be those few that share the ideology.

If corporations openly operated the way our polictics does, could you imagine the TV commercials Coke would run against Pepsi?

Conservatives have been lied to for so long, they are fearful and hostile and have no civility left. And liberals have had enough. They've decided to lose some of their civility as well. And our governance is open conflict. The wealthy get more wealthy. The middle class keeps shrinking. You can't support a family on a single middle class income as you could through the 1990's. And while President Obama did the best he could at trying to regain the economy lost, Wallstreet rebounded. Mainstreet, not so much. But it was because mainstreet took the hit that wallstreet could rebound.  Taxes make our government work. And because corporations have caused such distress in our population, they should bear the brunt of repairing it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For too many people, that's not a feasible option. First, a person must have the ability to change jobs. If you're living by the paycheck, this is a non-starter. Then You'd have to pay first last and deposit on a new place. Then you'd need to have enough to physically make the move and pay for it. So, we're talking $6k just to move somewhere that makes sense. And all the while, not earning income during the process. For people who have large amounts of savings, this can be done. For those with no savings, it's not possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Later Thursday, the freshman lawmaker walked across the Capitol plaza and apologized in person. Lesko accepted it, and said she asked him, in the future, to debate her on the merits of legislation.

Well, we try to debate the merits of legislation, but republicans don't hear reason, only money. The legislation is without merit. It takes money away from public schools to give to the 0.1% of parents who would use a voucher to enroll their kids in a privately run, for-profit school. The solution to bad schools is certainly not to defund them. The same as for-profit education only breeds worse schools popping up all over the place in search of free easy money from the government. </TEXT>

There's a cultural disconnect in these communities which has them thinking they'll just be a rapper or basketball star. Their home life is so unstructured that when they grow up, they expect more for less. It's a lack of fathers and positive role models in the communities.

I would definitely not call conservative ideology drawn from wisdom. It's the opposite of wisdom. It's drawn from a narrow life perspective closed off from outside perspectives and influences. 

Liberalism, is drawn from a multi-generational, multi-perspective place. And takes into account human nature. And even attempts to regulate for human nature. And it's that attempt which annoys and infuriates conservatives. We try to protect them from themselves and they resent it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> a few points come to mind.

First, the article mentions Denmark, which was just voted as the happiest country on Earth. They don't have to despair if they miss a single paycheck or get sick or lose their job.

Second, I'm always reminded of the Tea Party rallies of years past where we could see gun-toting conservatives carrying signs saying, "Keep your government hands off my medicare". 

Third, a basic income is being piloted around the world in various countries. Results are pending.

Fourth, Alaska has a State fund which is supported by oil revenues and pays a divident to every qualifying citizen of the state, regardless of their employment status. It's value varies year by year.

Programs which are completely socialist in nature are the following: Public schools, medicare, medicaid, social security, SNAP, Section 8 housing, Earned Income Credit, and others.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_programs_in_the_United_States

I always heard my parents talk about how they paid into social security and medicare, and now they were getting it back. But that's not an accurate assessment. And the majority of baby boomers didn't understand this. They didn't realize they were paying into a program that was immediately paying out to eligible citizens. Baby boomers also didn't realize the costs for their collection of benefits far exceeded what they paid into programs.

Socialism is an ugly word to many people. Democratic socialism has a meaning to me that If you're making money hand over fist at the expense of someone, or many people, the government can make you pay more in taxes to cover programs which are going to have to cover services for those people.  In other words, if your company lays off 1,000 people, those people will now have to collect either severance pay or more likely unemployment benefits. If those workers are above a certain age, they won't readily find work. Companies already pay into unemployment as part of their taxes. But, what if those workers start losing their houses or getting sick and no longer have the means to pay for services as they did when they were employed? This inevitably happens. Then they might qualify for medicaid or other services. Well medicaid has to be funded. And It needs to provide more services to more people as a direct result of your company laying off workers, and supposedly outsourcing jobs to India where labor is cheaper. I believe that your company should have to pay a tax for outsourcing work to cheaper markets to make up for the burden you've placed on the government by choosing to collect more profits by hiring cheaper labor. There's a finite amount of money in the system. It can't all go to you. If it does, it's at someone else's expense. And not just your fired workers. It reverberates throughout the entire economy as lost revenues to companies who see fewer sales of goods and services because your 1,000 workers suddenly have little to no purchasing power. When you combine this on a larger scale within the entire economy with regards to shifting labor forces overseas to promote your own profit, you can see the effect it has on the entire economy. Third world countries are building a middle class. And our middle class diminishes. That has far reaching effects on the future of business in America. And over time, with diminished purchasing power, Americans get poorer and poorer, and you get more wealthy. Now you have far more than you would have had. And your laid off 1,000 workers, many of whom have fallen into poverty, or gotten sick and died from lack of care, or fell to addiction, won't ever recover to a living standard they once had. But yours has gone up. And since you're so wealthy, you want to keep more of your "hard earned" money. And you start to think, why should I pay for poor people? They should have made better choices. So our society makes better choices concerning the welfare of the people. We say, you should pay more in taxes to cover the services which are required as a direct result of your actions to seek more profit. And you say, it's mine. I don't want to help poor people. They're someone else's problem. So, when that financial crisis hit in 2008, America got downsized. Corporations lost pension plans, and investments, and suddenly corporate purchasing power went down. Banks weren't lending to anyone. And if banks aren't lending, banks can't earn money. And if you can't get business credit, you can't expand, or in some cases, do business. And now your business needs to downsize greatly just to survive. You must scale back to keep your standard of living. But if you do scale back, the market demands won't be met and a competitor could swoop in and steal your share. So the government steps in and provides economic stimulus. This is corporate welfare. Tax dollars going directly to corporate America to keep the gears turning. But as American citizens, we say, we don't want to help poor corporations. They should have made better choices. </TEXT>

Enough is enough. We're taking our country back from the robber barons and trust fund babies and captains of industry. The "free market" is nothing more than a wealth redistribution scheme.

<TEXT> The article cites Jeffrey Carr and "other cyberwarfare experts"

Yet as Jeffrey Carr and other cyberwarfare experts have pointed out, this methodology is fatally flawed. Its important to know that the process of attributing an attack by a cybersecurity company has nothing to do with the scientific method, writes Carr:

The "Other cyberwarfare experts" article states this:

CrowdStrike, the firm that detected the DNC hack, calls APT 28 Fancy Bear. Until recently, the company's founder, Dmitri Alperovitch, said he had "medium level confidence" that the group was run by the GRU, Russia's military intelligence service. Now, he says the confidence level has changed to high. The increase comes from the finding by CrowdStrike that a Ukrainian-developed Android application, used to simplify targeting data for the D-30 howitzer, was contaminated with a version of APT 28 malware.

https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-12-22/why-i-still-don-t-buy-the-russian-hacking-story

And this article cites this:

Cybersecurity firm finds evidence that Russian military unit was behind DNC hack.
While CrowdStrike, which was hired by the DNC to investigate the intrusions and whose findings are described in a new report, had always suspected that one of the two hacker groups that struck the DNC was the GRU, Russias military intelligence agency, it had only medium confidence. Now, said CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch, we have high confidence it was a unit of the GRU. CrowdStrike had dubbed that unit Fancy Bear.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cybersecurity-firm-finds-a-link-between-dnc-hack-and-ukrainian-artillery/2016/12/21/47bf1f5a-c7e3-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html?utm_term=.a8b12135ba5c

So, this entire article is based on unchecked sources and random headlines. Total nonsense. Is this what passes for journalism these days? You can't cite an article which disproves your thesis and act like you're actually doing work.  </TEXT>

prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.

or 

the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.

I simply don't believe your stance is particularly popular. And the argument can be made that most of the people who share your viewpoint, do so in conflict with their own interests. But the budget is clearly not in keeping with American values. Trumps choices to cut relatively inexpensive programs that help real Americans to pay for his repeated trips to Mara Lago shows a lack of morality. His choice to cut funding to the NYPD, by $190 million, shows a lack of morality. He fully understands the NYPD protects his own family and property. Deciding to cut their funding, thereby reducing the city's ability to provide protection for his family is amoral. Make any argument you want against this. It simply won't follow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> two things to remember:
Bernie is independent.
Bernie is winning hearts and minds in the heartland through his townhall meetings with Chris Hayes on MSNBC. He's visiting deeply red states and talking with people about issues. He's winning them on issues. These are deeply conservative people who are starting to recognize that they aren't so conservative after all, because it's not in their own interest to be conservative. This has always been the conundrum of the conservative base. So many of them vote against their own interests. They tend to only listen to vitriol coming from alt-right conservative media outlets because they are being told bad things about the "evil liberals". It's only when they recognize the party shifted it's values that they understand they don't share those values. The republican party now only advocates for the ultra wealthy. They put in place policies that only benefit the wealthy. And when people start to understand this they understand the reality of their situation. And they start to think more deeply about what they really want. And they start to recognize their party doesn't want what they want. And now those voters are starting to understand that Trump directly lied to them to gain power. And this is the core difference between the parties. Democrats believe the government should follow the will of the people. Republicans believe government should only do what the constitution says and stay out of everything else, especially a "free" market. We have had decades of evidence that proves that a "free" market always gravitates towards monopolies and rule by Robber Barons, which inevitably leads to fascism, where the corporations become the government. And it's not a far leap to see that corporate interests have unduly influenced government for decades. And now that Trump is in power, he is filling the administration with corporate interests. The swamp is filling, and it's the more rain is coming. </TEXT>

India only has a middle class because American companies sent American wealth en masse to reap benefits from cheap labor. It's upwardly mobilized almost an entire Indian generation. But in doing this good thing for India, it has had a negative effect on an entire American generation. I'd imagine this is how your red state sees you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Morality is subjective to those who have loose morals.

American morals have been pretty solid for at least a hundred years.

There are a few morals shared by a majority of the nation. Don't kill, help those less fortunate, heal the sick, protect the weak.  Those are core values shared by most of the world. This budget goes against most of those. The logical takeaway is that Donald Trump doesn't believe in the morality of those values. It's not his priority to protect the weak or heal the sick or help those less fortunate. It's pretty clear that those who have never done without have far less empathy for those without. And this is where morality comes into play. One can argue that Bill Gates and Warren Buffet have better morals than Donald Trump and his ilk. It's been very clear, considering Trumps record, that he does not believe in American values the way the majority of the nation does. Trump has a proven record of lying, cheating, misogyny, faking charitable donations, and racism. It's not a logical leap to make the argument that his budget is not in keeping with the morality of Administrations past. I argue that Donald Trump isn't immoral, but amoral. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The alt-right believe that some degree of separation between peoples is necessary for a culture to be preserved. 

By "culture" he, of course, means racism. The only people that appear to be complaining about this live in rural areas. The 21st century is spreading and they don't like it.

The alt-right are, by all means, the American Taliban. They are opposed to progress and change in any form that doesn't see themselves on top.

I wrote about this just after the election:

I think the core of our ideological differences resides in how we perceive time. I plan for the future which adapts to change to fix today's problems. Conservatives plan for a future which regresses because they think today's problems are caused by change. But that's the nature of time. Why we call it an arrow. You can't go back. Only forward.
So let's look forward. And in every decision you make, think of how you can adapt to the inevitable change of the universe. Evolve. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a cognitive disconnect. It's taken me most of my life to realize exactly what the parties stand for.

Democrat: the government should do what the people want and what's best for the people.

Republican: I can do whatever I believe the constitution says, and stop adding to it to say I can't. 

It doesn't take a PhD in political science to understand we need more political parties in this country. The republican party was co-opted in the late 1960's by those who saw an opportunity to walk back all of the progress made. The party of Lincoln was educated and moderate. The current state of the party is in shambles. It's members, who once stood for conservative values are now being led by the most right-wing people possible. And it is ignorance alone that is to blame.

Meanwhile, the democratic party which once stood for truth, justice, and the American way has been co-opted by social justice warriors who try to force equality by forcing affirmative action of every sort. They used to change hearts and minds. Now they leave them behind and fight for their causes like the most right-wing zealots.

It leaves people like me with a distaste for them both. I am a bit like Bernie in my want for social services. But I'm a full supporter of the 2nd amendment. The people have a contract with government. But it's now being run by people who despise government. People who believe we shouldn't have a contract. People who believe it's every man for himself. Despite the core of the republican party whose ideas are dying in the killing fields of politics, they fall for the rhetoric. We don't need a conservative or liberal president. We need a moderate president. And moderates in the congress. We need to center the country again. The current vision for our nation is a bleak and dark picture. It's what the loudest minority believe they want. Even though it goes against their own interests. Ignorance. When America stopped teaching civics, we lost something. How many of you can, right now without google, tell me what kind of legislature we have? Or tell me how many votes is required to pass vetoed legislation? Or tell me what the line of succession is to the fifth person? How many can tell me how old you have to be to run for president, or senate? How many justices are in the SCOTUS? For what reason the secret service was started? If you vote, you should know the answer to all of these questions. If you don't know, what are you voting for? Who are you voting for? Why are you voting for that person? Does that person have a record of doing those things you want?

"You don't need to pass an IQ test to be in the Senate" --Senator Mark Pryor

This is what makes this question invalid. We say, "we're affecting the rate of climate change." And deniers say, "well how much are we?" The scientific answer is complicated. The layman's answer is by a lot. Because the rate is the measurement, not the percentage. Deniers don't possess the mental faculties to understand the answer, because it's not a percentage. It's a complicated answer that doesn't boil down to layman digestible  format. And because the answer is so complicated, people say it's bullshit.

<TEXT> There is actual evidence. That ukranian is currently being investigated by the FBI. We have the Trump aide confessing that Trump ordered the Russia policy softened. We also have photographic and phone records which prove that Trump met with Sergey Kislyak. We have phone records which prove that Manafort met with the Ukranian. We have photographic evidence which proves that Trump met with Russian Oligarch, "the fertilizer king". This is evidence, not speculation. Continue to ignore evidence you don't like. And this kind of tactic is childish at best. It's the same kind of tactic I see Tucker Carlson using to disqualify answers he doesn't like. Unless you provide me with exactly the specific qualifier I'm asking, everything you're saying is false. It's a tactic used by dummies to continue to support their beliefs when they don't hold up under scrutiny. It's not my opinion.

at the RNC, Paul Manafort met with a Russian national he worked with in Ukraine. There, he informed trump they wanted the Republican platform changed.

<TEXT> reporting indicates that, prior to June 2016, the Obama Justice Department and FBI considered a criminal investigation of Trump associates, and perhaps Trump himself, based on concerns about connections to Russian financial institutions.

What reporting? Where are these reports? Who reported them?

In June, the Obama Justice Department submitted an application that apparently named Trump in addition to some of his associates.

I'm sorry, you, this reporter, and anyone who knows, won't have access to a FISA warrant application.

Not taking no for an answer, the Obama Justice Department evidently returned to the FISA court in October 2016, the critical final weeks of the presidential campaign. 

Where is the proof of this? Again, those who, know won't say. Those who say, don't know. FISA courts are top secret. Reporters won't get access to these proceedings or their processes.

And if you continue to read the article, it asks the questions of whether this took place or not.  Read the whole article before you run around citing sources which aren't facts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> in the past three weeks, in four separate incidents, I've had people try to crash into me on the Turnpike or I-95 because they're driving like idiots and I have to honk my horn. Three of them have cut me off, I honk and they look in their rear view mirror and slam on their brakes. The fourth, someone tried to change lanes into me and I honk. He looks at me and then tries to ram into me.

I'm sane and have avoided the accidents.  The last one, my son was in the car with me. When my family is present, I don't take chances, and I don't play. And I hope none of these people ever try to stop me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was BCP, not TSA.

And honestly, I don't think this is entirely a bad idea. I have worked with "engineers" who couldn't engineer their way out of a wet paper bag, but they worked cheaper than Americans. If cheap foreign labor can't enter the country, it means companies will be forced to pay for Americans. While that is a capitalism nightmare, it's perfectly in line with Trumps agenda. Not that I am specifically for Trump's agenda, but I am for cracking down on H-1B Visa abuse. H-1B Visas have unfairly tipped the scales against highly-skilled American workers.

Before the H-1B visa, I could easily get $85 an hour for highly-skilled field work. Now companies like work market bid out skilled field service to the lowest bidder. They want you to go onsite at your expense and perform what may account to several hours of work for a low flat fee in some cases $20. It has put a severe hamper on my business and my growth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the great disconnect between the neo-conservative movement and the rest of the country. You see, wealthy people give no thought for how things will get paid. They think in terms of, "I'm wealthy, I don't need to look at the price tag." They assume the money will materialize because they are wealthy. The rest of us question how.

This is not Lincoln's party. It hasn't been in over 60 years. 

The rest of us know that money has to come from somewhere. Trump said we should bring back all the dollars from the rest of the world. Yeah, that's a real sound strategy for finding a trillion dollars. Look in the couch cushions of the rest of the world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ajit Pai has stated that strict regulation reduces network investment.

This is patently false. Reduced competition eliminates the need for network investment. Strict regulation balances the gap left by reduced competition. 

Ajit Pai is a bad apple from the core. The beginning of his career was spent providing regulatory relief from the Telecom Act of 1996. All he heard was how that act "hurt business". It has tainted his mind ever since. If you disregard the DSL competition boom of the late 1990's thanks entirely to the Telecom act of 1996, you might be persuaded it was harmful to business. In fact, it was a boon to business and harmful only to Ma Bell who had to endure competition for the first time.

His views are vehemently anti-consumer. He shows extreme disregard for consumer choice, price gouging, and industry monopolization. This man belongs nowhere near the FCC. He is a danger to the Internet. He is a danger to the economy. He is a danger to the first amendment of the Constitution of the United States. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, extreme ties to Russia. He was majority shareholder in a Cypriot bank whose chairman was "reassigned" from Deutsche Bank after the Russian money laundering scandal. Secondary shareholder was a Russian oligarch who laundered money and friend of Putin. Former chairman was a friend of Putin. And Ross brokered a saving grace for Trump in the form of a $100 million house sale ($60 million profit) to said Russian Oligarch trying to hide money from his wife. At a time when Trump was struggling to pay off a loan to Deutsche bank. Everything worked out great, didn't it? </TEXT>

It was a "town hall" meeting with around 20 people they cold called based on people who had contacted Rubio via his website in the past. There were 3 questions asked by "constituents" that were screened by staff prior to being allowed. Only suitable softball questions were allowed. The whole thing lasted about 40 minutes. Then Rubio was in the wind. Very stand-offish. Very us vs them mentality. Rubio hates his constituents. He is only in the Senate to advance someone else's agenda. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's talk about Comcast. In my market, it is a monopoly. Municipal contracts force local governments to lock into a single cable provider. In 1996, there was a DSL explosion which saw a rapid rise of several DSL providers in each market. This happened because the government forced ma bell to open her precious lines to competition.
Then deregulation happened. Now all of the DSL companies have dried up. The technology has stalled. And I can only get comcast for fast Internet. It's little different than when Google tried to roll out fiber service in Nashville and the local carriers fought every step of the way to prevent competition.

<TEXT> Wife and two kids are my world. I have a son 9 and a daughter 5. Since wife is a teacher, everyone's on winter break. Kids get to stay up late and have fun. Son wants to sleep at grandma's house, ok. Daughter sleeps home. She decides she wants to watch sofia at 10PM. OK. We're all up late. Wife goes to sleep. Daughter watches sofia in bed. Midnight rolls around, daughter still watching sofia. I have to use my phone to change the roku because remotes don't last long in our house. I quickly switch from sofia to her nightly youtube kids music for sleeping. Daughter smiles at me and says, "I watched eight sofias." Everyone goes to sleep. 

Wife and I wake up around 9 AM. Son comes home. 10:50AM. Lovely daughter calls out to mommy and daddy. Yes dear? "I can't open my eye."  Wife is in the shower. I go to my daughter and she's covering her eye. I get some wipes. Go to clean daughter's eye. She's scared.  After convincing her they're just wipes and nothing wrong, she relents. I clean her eye, no crust. She says, "I still can't see."  Wife asks, "do we need to take her to the doctor, is it an eye infection?"  Nope. I tell lovely daughter, "I'll get you a warm compress, it will make your eyes feel better." Get wash cloth, run it under "warm" water. Take it to daughter. I put it on her eyes.  She ragefully yells at me, "TOO HOT." It's not sweetie. I go to the bathroom. Wife is still in shower.  Wife asks what's wrong. I explain lovely daughter has grown up eyes from not getting enough sleep. Light is piercing her skull as we all experience as parents. Daughter hears whole conversation. Daughter wants me to take wash cloth away. I tell her to just throw it on the floor and I'll get it when I'm done in the bathroom. Lovely five year old daughter doesn't like to wait and wants me to get it now. She starts screaming. "OOOOO You're making me angry." Wife and I start chuckling. I explain to daughter her eyes hurt because she didn't get enough sleep. She starts raging more. Wife and I start laughing harder. Lovely five year old daughter screams out to me, "You're a moron!"

TL;DR Daughter, 5, got angry called me a moron

<TEXT> Considering the length of such a free fly, I think it's safe to assume we could have 2.6 inbound imminently. The best tactic could be to give people just a taste of what's coming and then put it on display for sale. I believe something will happen on October 31st. During the recent events we saw what was coming in 2.6. And we saw 3.0 on display. We saw a good roadmap for releases through 4.0 iirc. Considering that CIG is now a well oiled machine, we should expect 3-4 months between point releases. I think Star Marine is going to be finished very soon and we should see those stability improvements we all expect. Buttery smooth motion from the engine. The key evidence is the two specials post-citizen con and the lack of talk about 2.6 during citizen con. It's my hunch, but I've got a good feeling about it. Talk among yourselves. </TEXT>

Since it was the blue 0.7 version, I decided to tear it apart to see what kind of cart it used. Apparently the barrel unscrews and the cart is simply a dropper fill which snaps in place. And since the pens use water-based ink to begin with... You won't have to ditch the pen until the roller ball wears out.

I was having a quick meeting next to his cube where he was training me on trouble shooting skills. I'm paying attention to him and I kept looking back behind me while he was talking to me. I had no idea what amblyopia was, nor had I ever seen it before. So Milton is going on and I keep looking back. Finally he stops and asks me what I'm looking at. I replied, I don't know, whatever you're looking at. Amblyopia is also called lazy eye. Milton was not amused.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been playing a lot of 2.5 and I played 2.5PTU before it was pushed to PU. I saw one bug in the PTU, which was the freelancer side door not closing. In PU, I'm getting glitches all over the place. From lag warping, to getting stuck on a pad, to a ship not handling like it should, to warping through when trying to mount ships, to other citizens vanishing. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Quick, easy CCP night sights </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-31 21:09:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I decided to quickly make night sights for my CCP.  The results are pretty good.

Step one, [get some white acrylic hobby paint in matte white and then get some glow in the dark powder.](http://imgur.com/E7UQ0vF) It's important to use acrylic paint, if you use oil based or enamel, it will eat the plastic in your sights. You could also theoretically use white school glue.

Step two, mix a fair amount of powder into the paint until it's a pasty consistency.  I used a toothpick to mix mine.

Step three, smush some of the paste into the sight holes. Make sure it gets into the holes.  Then wipe away the excess with your finger, clean up the rest with a paper towel.

Here are the sights in the [day](http://imgur.com/3MBo9XQ) and in the [dark](http://imgur.com/7dfqUEm).

I've found this combination to last several years. I made some years ago to paint my ceiling fan pulls so I don't get my hand chopped off trying to turn on the lights. Also works great on light switches. </TEXT>

<TITLE> 2016 Tucson and Android Auto, only for Limited? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-29 01:51:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a 2016 Tucson ECO.  I do not have the 8" navigation system which only came on the Limited.  I've got the 5" xm with backup camera system. I'm piecing together information from press releases and the Hyundai website which leads me to believe that only the Limited will receive the Android Auto update.



*From a recent [Verge article](http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/26/11785996/hyundai-android-auto-carplay-diy-update): "and Tucson are eligible, depending on what infotainment package they've got installed"



*From [this Hyundai page](https://www.hyundaiusa.com/myhyundai/manuals-and-how-tos/getfaq?faqid=8 category=vehicle_releases): FAQ's
Are Android Auto and/or CarPlay available on the 2016 Tucson?

Android Auto and CarPlay will be available on the new Tucson but both systems currently have a delayed availability.



*From [this Hyundai page](http://www.carolinahyundai.com/blog/when-will-the-2016-hyundai-tucson-have-android-auto/): The 2016 Hyundai Tucson will have Android Auto and Apple CarPlay
And its finally here! According to a May 2016 press release, current Tucson owners can download Apple CarPlay and Android Auto for their vehicles with a USB memory stick or SD card when they log into MyHyundai.com. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKZ5m4fXEeY) also details how to get the smartphone integration software on your Tucson (finally) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hit or miss performance in matches. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-05 22:20:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> so, apologies for this slight rant. I'll try not to devolve into a shitpost. When I started playing this on PC, it was day one and I really enjoyed it. Then I couldn't find any matches for months due to a bug with the jakku expansion.  Then after I fixed that, everything worked great.

I've been in full servers where I normally finish top 3. My k/d has never been great, but I'm beginning to wonder why my shots aren't doing as much damage as is being done to me.

Now a few things I've noticed. And here is where it gets a bit ranty.  I've been in full servers where I normally finish top 3. My k/d has never been great, but I'm beginning to wonder why my shots aren't doing as much damage as is being done to me. I feel as if I've been nerfed as a player. I feel like my shots don't do as much damage as other players shots do on me. It wasn't always like this, just in the past week or so.  I notice when I find a match, there's always one or two players with a really high k/d ratio. And the rest of us are normal. Last night, I was playing walker assault and I was using the ca-87 shock blaster.  From approximately 30ft away, I shot a player 3 times with this blaster and he shot me once and I died while he had over 80% of his health.  And this was the span of three shots of the ca-87. 

And just today I was playing blast.  I shot a player with three hits of the se-14c, at least 2 hit, and then melee'd him in the head. He hit me once and killed me while retaining 25% health.

I wish these were isolated incidents.  These are the norm this past week. Does anyone else have issues like this?  Where no matter how many times you shoot an opponent, they kill you with a single hit? I'm not one to rage.  And I'm not one to question other people's skill, especially since there was a time at least 15 years ago, when I played CS at that level. When I was in my early 20's and did nothing else for 8 hours a day but play CS. 

Am I alone?  I have to question at this point whether I just suck. But given my performance history, I'm not so sure I just started sucking a week ago.  And let's skip the "you just suck" posts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you have trouble finding games to join, try this experiment for me.

Log into origin, add the ["free" battle for jakku expansion](https://www.origin.com/en-us/store/buy/star-wars-battlefront/pc-download/addon/star-wars-battlefront-battle-of-jakku) to your cart and checkout.

Then tell me if you can find games.

I couldn't find any games to play and once I did this, it instantly found games like it did on launch.

**UPDATE** there is confusion about this post.  I had Battle for Jakku installed and running since the day it was released.  I installed it from origin under my game tab.  However once I installed it, I couldn't find or play any games with the battle for Jakku expansion selected in the multiplayer tab.  However if I selected main game only, it would rarely find a game to play. By completing this transaction in the origin store, I was instantly able to play all games including battle for Jakku content. It is my belief that this origin store bug might be why the game seems like a ghost town. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So you got a fountain pen? Great. Welcome to the club. Now you too can enjoy the illustrious world of fancy pens and colorful inks. But now that you have pens that require more maintenance than shaking, here's a few helpful tips to get you started and potentially save you the time, money and embarrassment of destroying your new pen.

**Things to do with your new pen**

* before inking, flush your pen with cold water

Some pens contain manufacturing oils. A quick flush with plain cold water will help. If you notice your pen feels or looks like it has oil, a tiny drop of dish soap in the cup can help remove the oil.

* make sure you have installed the converter properly before inking

Ink is very saturated and by its nature, it stains most things it touches. It helps if your converter is installed properly. It also helps if you place your ink bottle on top of a paper towel and a foam disposable plate or bowl. That way if you fumble around with doll hands, you have a second to pick up your bottle before it goes everywhere.

* cartridges are easily installed if they're the right size

They come in several sizes. Short International is the most common. There's also Long International and various proprietary sizes as well. Lamy carts are proprietary.

* once you fill your pen,  clean the section with a paper towel and replace the barrel and cap AND REPLACE THE CAP ON THE INK BOTTLE.

Open ink bottles are a disaster waiting to happen. Renters don't take the chance, recap your bottles.

* write write write and then recap your pen

Fountain pen ink is mostly water. It dries. Replace the caps on your pens if you're not writing for more than a couple minutes. This will save you trouble with clogged up feeds.

* clean your pens after a few fills

Some inks are worse than others. After two fills, I like to clean my pens. Some can be disassembled for easy cleaning, others cannot. The easiest way to clean is the flush with plain cold water. If you can pull the nib and feed, a soft toothbrush with a drop of dish soap and cold water works best. And don't forget to clean your caps. Wet q-tips work best.


**what *NOT* to do with your new pen**

* Do not drop it

Fountain pens are delicate precision instruments. They won't work properly if they're dropped. The nib will get destroyed if dropped.  But worse is some pens will also break the feed if dropped, especially with plastic feeds. If someone asks to try your pen, and you agree, give it to them with the cap secured firmly. Then ask that they replace the cap when they're done. 

* Do not clean it with hot water

Fountain pens are mostly made of plastic or metal these days. Some vintage pens are made of other materials like celluloid which will warp or expand in surprisingly low temperatures. If it's too hot for little kid hands it's too hot for your pen. Temperature changes in pens tends to cause expansion or retraction of the air inside the converter. Pressure times Volume is proportional to Temperature. These are very small volumes which is why we see ink in our caps sometimes.

* Do not clean with chemicals

Some vendors make a pen flush. Those are specially formulated for fountain pens. Those are OK as long as they are specifically designed for fountain pens. Goulet pens makes a flush which is safe to use. Don't use anything by Koh-I-Noor. Those products aren't made for fountain pens. They are made for india ink and stylo drafting pens. *Never* use alcohol to clean a pen. It will destroy the plastic parts on any pen.

This post will be updated periodically. Enjoy your new pens and Write^write^write </TEXT>
