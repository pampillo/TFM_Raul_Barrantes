<TITLE> Eating For Free on My Birthday </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 18:08:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yesterday was my birthday. Before going to the restaurant to eat for free, I went to tutoring. We completed a chapter from the accounting class before the lecture in my class. The tutor won't be available on Wednesday because he will be going to an internship.

The restaurant have five locations: two in Manhattan, one in Queens, one in Brooklyn, and one in New Jersey. I went to the one at East Village by bus because it's just two train stops to the restaurant. The place wasn't still in renovation, so I took the bus to Chinatown.

The buses that go to Chinatown is frequented by seniors, as younger people prefer the subway. I would go to Chinatown from my college via subway as it is 4 stops away and 2 or 3 dozen bus stops away.

When I entered, the restaurant wasn't that buzy. I got a seat right away and showed my ID for my free meal. I ordered their curry soup base hot pot with mountain yam, fried tofu, special pork, lamb, fish fillet, Fuzhou fish balls, fried dough, rice, fish roe balls, fried tofu skin, and crab sticks. The crab sticks are served with plastic wrap. I removed the wrap after putting the crab sticks into the pot.

When I went to the sauce counter, I mix sesame sauce, peanut sauce, peanut oil, welsh onion, cilantro, soy sauce, hoisin sauce and wasabi. Some of the labels are misplaced. When I came back the second time, I found chili oil, so I took the bowl of sauce and added the chili sauce. I mix the sauce up and end up with a red, pungent, and savory concoction.

I couldn't finish the rice and went got tong sui for dessert. I chose to have grass jelly with coconut milk to neutralize the acidity from the hot pot. I left $2 as tips. </TEXT>

However, on Monday, he forgot to pick up the birthday cake because he was busy and when he tried to pick it up the bakery closed.

Today, he told me that he will pick it up when he goes to work and put it in the fridge and I have to remind him to get it from the fridge at 10pm. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-05-08 02:06:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There are various kinds of ramen soup bases you may not have heard of or never tasted before.

The simplest and oldest type of soup base is salt. It is just chicken stock flavored with salt. The Hakodate ramen uses this kind of soup base.

The second type of soup base is soy sauce. It is chicken stock flavored with soy sauce. The Tokyo ramen uses this soup base.

The third type of soup base is tonkotsu. Tontoksu is pork bone stock. Kyushu uses this kind of soup base. The Ajisen and Ichiran chains are based in Kyushu and have three stores and one store in NYC respectively.

The fourth type of soup base is miso. Miso is fermented soy bean paste. This is a newcomer and is originated in Hokkaido.

<TITLE> Hotpot Restaurants vs. Asian Barbecue Restaurants </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-07 04:16:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There are various versions of hotpot: Japanese hotpot, i.e. shabu shabu and sukiyaki, Chinese hot pot, i.e. doulao and huowuo, and Korean hotpot, i.e. jjigae and sinseollo.

There are Chinese and Taiwanese hotpot restaurants where you ask the waiter items you want to eat or get it yourself at the counters and dump it in your pot of broth before taking it our before eating. Restaurants usually use electric burners to heat your pot.

There are some restaurants that use gas burners. I don't like using gas burners because the fire is inconsistent, can leak carcinogenic poisons, and needs to be replaced from time to time. Electric burners are consistent and is easy to control.

In these restaurants, you have to make your sauce at the sauce counter. I like mixing sesame oil, peanut sauce, sesame sauce, shacha BBQ sauce, wasabi, chili oil, soy sauce, ponzu or lemon, oyster sauce, welsh onions, and cilantro. I whisk up my sauce and end up with a red concoction that is spicy and acidic. Some restaurant charge extra for drinks but there is only one that includes drinks in NYC. I drink a bottle of Yakult to coat my stomach.

I like to order pork, beef, lamb, offal, fish, squid, clams, potato, yams, taro, fish balls, tofu, and noodles. For thick items like seafood and vegetables, I just let them sit in the broth and fetch them up later. I swish the thinly slices of meat at they cook easily. Letting them sit on the broth will make them hard to eat.

I always end the hotpot meal with dessert. I eat ice cream as it's a dairy. Some do include tong sui water dessert.

There is only one restaurant that lets you eat for free on your birthday and there is one that gives a discount for showing your student ID.

The Japanese shabu-shabu is a hot pot dish where you swish the meats in the water before dipping in sauce. You only have ponzu and sesame sauce. From time to time, you would have to remove floating scum to keep the broth consistent. There is only one restaurant that serves buffet shabu-shabu in NYC and in New Jersey with a sauce counter.

The Koreans don't have Chinese or Japanese-like hotpot restaurants but have the sinseollo and the jjigae. Jjigae are stews cooked in ceramic pots. One well-known jjigae is budae-jjigae that was developed during the Korean war that uses instant ramen and American ingredients. The sinseollo used to be eaten by the royalty. It consists of 22 ingredients and is considered nutritious.

There are three types of barbecue restaurants: Korean barbecue, Japanese yakiniku, and Chinese chuan skewers and shaomi Cantonese BBQ.

In Korean barbecue, the waiter cooks the food for you. The portion sizes is suitable to be shared with friends. At the end of the meal, any uneaten pieces of kimchi and meats will be used to make fried rice to end the meal. You are also served complementary banchan and samchu to wrap your meats on. Waiters usually bring the food to your table to be cooked. However, there is a restaurant where you go to the counter to pick up. Usually, the grills are flat or slanted for the fat to be collected with an flame hood hanging from the ceiling. Smokeless grills are not that common as it's not authentic to Korean style.

The last time I ate Korean BBQ was in Summer 2014. The restaurant serves it buffet style. I ordered too much. In top of meats, they have cooked food of fried chicken, pajeon, and japchae.

In Japanese yakiniku, the portions are usually bite-sized unless stated, which is ideal for one person. Restaurants usually have waiters bring the food to you, but there are few that require you to pick up from the counter. In Japan, there are restaurants that uses shichirin bucket grills filled with charcoal with a flame hood hanging from the ceiling. However, in NYC, there are no charcoal yakiniku, but uses smokeless grills that uses electric or ceramic charcoal possibly due to regulations. You cook the food yourself unless stated. In addition to yakiniku, there are yakitori skewers. Some yakiniku restaurants do also have yakitori as part of the buffet, but are not that common. In Hokkaido, there is the jingisukan, a dish consists of grilled lamb on a pan, instead of a net in yakiniku.

In NYC, there are the chains Yakiniku Gen, Yakiniku Futago, Gyukaku, and Yakiniku West, and the independent restaurant Takeshi. One time, I invited my friend to eat at Gen and ordered all of their assorted items and paid $130. At Futago, I ordered two orders of offals, samgeopsal, appetizers, cold noodles, and kakigori shaved ice and paid $93. At Takashi, I ordered to orders of beef and paid $30. Gyukaku have the cheapest prices as they have happy hour, lunch special, and group sets. They have buffet but is only limited-time.

The Chinese don't eat barbecue similar to the Korean or Japanese style. However, there are chuan skewers and siu mei Cantonese barbecue. In NYC, there are these street venders that sell skewers by item and grill the food before you. I don't eat that often. There are restaurant in NYC that sell skewers where you cook on your own, but charge by item, instead of buffet. The siu mei Cantonese barbecue is cooked in rotisserie. I am not a fan of chicken, but like to eat duck, char siu, and roast pork. The Mongolian barbecue is not Mongolian but is a modern barbecue originated from Taiwan. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Passing of AHCA </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hi David. After AHCA 3.0 was passed in the House, I don't see it passing in the Senate, but rather have it revised. If it passed to the White House, I would see blue state implementing their form of healthcare, or what California is doing right now is attempting to pass their own universal health care. I think it will pass due to the it being popular by Bernie Sanders. Other states will follow suit. </TEXT>

<TITLE> YouTube Adpocalypse Will Only Cause YouTube to Fail </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-06 18:27:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For more than a month since the start of YouTube Adpocalyse, many content creators are being affected. Every alternative news networks I subscribe to saw a decrease on revenue. However, they are making up the lost revenue by asking for donations from viewers and selling merchandise.

Some YouTubers have accounts on Twitch and Musical.ly for an alternative way to make money or have side jobs to earn alternative revenue. Lately, GradeAUnderA hasn't been uploading on YouTube for more than 4 weeks. Maybe he is buzy with Twitch or delay uploading the next video.

If the YouTube adpocalyse doesn't go away, content creators will leave and look for YouTube 2.0 as their new home. I myself would have a Twitch account and start an independent entertainment studio and create pay-per-view animation on iTunes or Netflix and have an account on YouTube until YouTube 2.0 is released. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why the AHCA Will Be Unpopular With Blue States </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-06 00:48:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Now the House passed the AHCA, we will see what the Senate will do. I asked a psychic about it and she said that the Senate will revise it and be pushed back to the House.

The new healthcare will affect the red states more than the blue states. The red states are poor while the blue states are richer. The blue states can reject the AHCA and raise their own taxes and implant their own healthcare. California is proposing a universal health care. It is likely that it will pass as it's popular due to Sanders. When that happens, other states will follow suit.

Red states, on the other hand, will have to drop healthcare for some people. This will cause poorer people and people with pre-existing conditions to go bankrupt and die from preventable diseases. That will cause an exodus into the blue states. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Being a Left-Wing Conspiracy Theorist </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-03 16:46:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have lived in NYC for the past 17 years. I myself can be considered a left-wing conspiracy theorist as NYC is a predominately liberal city.

My first post on Reddit is about Gravity Falls being a metaphor of the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections. The show was created by a liberal producer Alex Hirsch. I found a lot of parallels between the show and the respective presidential elections. However, season 2 only reflects the result if Hillary becomes president. The show is likely influenced by the Illuminati due to the fact that Bill Cipher is a triangle-shaped creature.

The Children's Anime Shin-chan is what I considered is a metaphor for globalism. Shin-chan's attires fits the colors of the Chinese flag. Kazama's attires fits the colors of the NYC flag. He also speaks English.

Anpanman is a metaphor for a salad bowl. In the show, you will see various cultures in the late creator's world. If I were to create an adult spin-off of it, I would include politically incorrect and vulgar content. I think that the late creator Takashi Yanase was influenced by the Illuminati due to the fact that one of his characters Niyandar Kamen is an anthropomorphic cat superhero. Cats have pointed ears that can resemble a triangle, the symbol of the Illuminati.

Any animator who have created any animation that contains cats or foxes are influenced by the Illuminati. These animals have pointy ears resembling triangles, the symbol of the Illuminati. Popular examples include, but not related to, the late Doraemon creator Fujiko F. Fujio, The Amazing World of Gumball creator Ben Bocquelet, failed pilot Kitty Bobo creators Kevin Kaliher and Meaghan Dunn, and the Cyborg Kuro-chan creator Naoki Yokouchi.

Prime Minister Winston Churchill was a racist, self-centered leader during the WWII. If he was a full-blown clone of Hitler, he would have enhance and glorify colonialism.

NYC is a predominately liberal city. Conservatives usually get marginalized here. Staten Island is a predominately conservative borough except for the northern neighborhoods. Due to Brexit, Staten Island may have its own Stanexit and become its own independent entity. If that happens, it will be stopped by the city.

Bakumatsu marks the end of the samurai era in Japan. During those final years, the East is pitted against the West. The East represents liberalism while the West represents conservation, with the emperor backing the West. After the last shogun abdicated, conservatism takes over Japan, even to this day.

The GOP is currently attempting to achieve political supremacy. However, it won't stick like the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan. After Trump leaves and another hard-line conservative is elected, we will see the demise of the GOP to the point of rebranding or dissolution.

The remilitarization of Japan can be viewed as a reignition of a Sino-Japanese cold war. I see that as a lose-lose situation. It can go nuclear.

The only way for Japan to turn politically left is by having a Bernie Sanders-like politican and have him as the prime minister. If Bernie Sanders himself was elected president, we would be better off than Trump.

Some police use stop-and-frisk tactics. This is a way to suppress minorities. NYC chose to discontinue the practice.

Using condoms is an effective way to prevent rape and child abuse. It forms a barrier between a penis and a vagina.

C-section-based abortions, or hysterotomy abortion, are acceptable. This is an alternative to ripping a fetus apart with a speculum. It is often done by Japanese soldiers during WWII. If I were to show a pregnant minor getting an abortion on Collegehumor, the surgeon will perform it by chaining the minor up. He then uses a dagger to cut open her womb and cut the umbilical cord with a regular scissors before stitching up the womb. This is all done without anesthesia.

Tanukis are raccoon-dogs that are viewed as good luck in Japanese culture. The reason why it is so is that the kanji for taunki refers a medium-sized animals resembling cats. As stated above, cats are part of the Illuminati.

I think the 8th Tokugawa shogunate Yoshimune from Kii, or modern-day Wakayama, is Japan's first Bernie Sanders before the 21st century. He is known as the unruly shogun, or ararenbo shogun. He mingles with the commoners and set up a box for commoners to make requests, thus making him a populist.

Every person gets killed by police in the US is one step closer to becoming a police state to racial suppression.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Trump-Kim Rivalry=Lose-Lose Situation </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We are see growing tensions betweens the US and North Korea to the point of nuclear war. I sense that both sides will face defeat should they fight.

Nuclear war will destroy humanity and is expensive to finance. This will not fix any existing problems. The nuclear war will turn into a world war. That is when full humanity will be annihilated.

Both Trump and Kim are narcissists and have a cult of personality. They are both equally dangerously incompetent. People in North Korea is living in misery. Only the ones in Pyongyang like in prosperity. Trump will fund military but will make people poor from social cuts.

However, there is a chance of North Korea unify with South Korea and Trump's approval rating will tank to 25% or lower.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Types of Grades Schools Give to Students </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-01 16:16:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There are various types of grading systems schools use to grade a student's performance.

During my elementary school years, the grades are based on a number system, with 1 for below target, 2 for approaching target, 3 for meeting target, and 4 for exceeding target. I got a lot of 2's as I didn't care about my classes then.

During my intermediate and high school years, the grades are based on number grades, with 55 as fail and increasing in 5-point increments, where from 90 points increase in 1-point increments. I never got a 55 in any classes but did got 65's and 75's. However, in high school, I had to change classes due to the fact that I was put into a class that I already took and on the report card it was N/A meaning that I was recently placed with limited class assignments completed.

In college, the grades are letter-based, the letters are based on the range of your performance in the classes a student take. Some classes are quite hard but there is tutoring. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On May 7, there will be an election to see who will be France's next president. Similar to the November 4 election, we see a runoff between an establishment left candidate and an anti-establishment right candidate. It was a lose-lose situation that if either one was elected, it doesn't help the US. Now that we have seen Trump's first 100 days, it was full of unconstitutional executive orders.

The same will follow in the French runoff. We may see the same situation. However, earlier this year, Wilders lost to Rutte in the Netherlands. If Wilders had won, Le Pen could have won easily. However, France might expect from the same old-same old campaigns.

If Le Pen won, the marginalized, the poor, and the minority will support Melenchon, similar to what Sanders is currently doing. If Melenchon was the top two in the first round, he could have won easily.  </TEXT>

45 isn't that popular due to his unconstitutional policies. These policies only made people miserable. He reached 50% unpopular rating in just 8 days.

All he did in the first 100 days was promoting his own brand. All of his world leaders visited him at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. He is already made US the laughingstock and turned it upside-down, similar to Berlusconi's tenure in Italy.

I don't see him getting a second term as by then his approval rating will be 25% or lower. </TEXT>

At the supermarket, there are dried salted fish that are sold. She would use salt brine to fermentate supermarket-brought fish. Today, when she opened the jar, the stench was unbearable. By the time I had lunch, it wasn't that salty and is served with minced meat.  </TEXT>

Sanders is quite popular. People who voted for Trump are turning to him because he is a socialist democrat, who believes that there should be a balance between socialism and capitalism. Currently, the US has a capitalistic government, that causes recessions from time to time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ever since 2015, I have been watching more independent news than corporate news. Independent news covers topics corporate news tend to avoid.

The first news network I watched was Infowars. I do not watch him anymore as this source is conspiracy theory-based. The reporter Alex Jones just makes up likes that cannot be confirmed. Recently, he apologized for the Pizzagate conspiracy he made up.

Currently, I get my news from The Young Turks, Ring of Fire, Jimmy Dore Show, The Davis Packman Show, The Humanist Report, and Secular Talk. These news networks have channels on YouTube. They report what mainstream news doesn't cover.

However, many large companies pulled their advertisements from the website due to a fake news report from the WSJ about videos showing up on right-wing channels. These reporters are making up their lost revenue with donations.

Recently, The Young Turks, Secular Talk and Sanders supporters teamed up together and created the Justice Democrats PAC to pick progressives to replace corporate and establishment Democrats. Donations rose quickly the few days after launching. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are three types of questions you will encounter in tests.

The first type of question you will encounter is multiple-choice questions. These questions require you to find the correct answers from the answers you are given. I would cross out the answers that are incorrect. College admission exams uses these to give students their grades right away.

The second type of questions you will encounter are short-answer responses. These questions require you to write a word or sentence. These require some time to grade as these questions can have more than one correct answer. When I took Japanese, every test I have taken consists of short-answer responses. Your answer is correct if it follows grammatical and syntax rules.

The third type of question you will encounter are essay questions. These questions tests your knowledge of a certain subject. These take the most time to grade as everyone have their own rubies. Each essay is different in wording and the way it is written. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why Algorithms Are Important When Doing Homework in College </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-20 04:18:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In college, we have homework that have to be completed online. We would input an answer and the program gives us instant feedback. This is a way to save time when computing final scores.

The programs check your answer using algorithms. Algorithms are a set of sequential instructions a program follow. They are used in calculators, especially graphing calculators. These calculators require an input and out comes the solution.

When I took calculus in college, some questions can be solved by inserting a complex answer. The software then uses algorithms to do its own calculations and determine if your answer is correct or not. For example, if a question asks for the derivative of abc, I would insert a'bc+ab'c+abc', the software then simplify the answer, and consider it correct. In a quiz, I inserted a correct complex answer and the professor reminded me to simplify it.

In accounting, the care if your numbers are correct and your accounts are correct. Sometimes, the software doesn't care about the ordering of accounts.

In logic philosophy, some questions can have more than one correct answer. The questions where you have use proofs only care when you get to the desired solution, similar to how it's done in geometry. </TEXT>

I took the ACT to ensure CUNY english proficiency, but found out they accept SAT, Regents, and the diagnostic exams.

The SUNY acceptance letter arrived first. I got accepted by one of the colleges I applied. I was given a packet to fill out. I still wanted to wait for the other colleges. I didn't fill out the forms and ignored their emails.

The private colleges arrived next. Only one responded back. I didn't want to go because it's expensive. I later declined their offer.

The CUNY colleges arrived the last. Two colleges accepted me. I replied only one of them. The offer came a few days before my birthday.

The college I currently attend is a very selective one. Getting accepted is a privilege for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I applied for high school, I applied several good schools, specialized high schools, and the zoned school. The specialized high schools are applied separately.

I listed the first eleven high schools with schools that my parents view highly of and included the zoned school at the end. I told the counselor that I wanted to take the specialized high school. She told us that our teachers will do it for them, possibly to save time.

When I took the specialized high school exam, I have more than enough time to complete each question, but got a 437 with no offer.

When I waited for the ordinary schools, I got selected by Long Island High School, which requires me to take the subway there or take two buses to get there. I went to the consular to apply for an appeal. I placed the Chinese school in Chinatown and my zoned school. I later got put into my zoned school.

After the first week of class, I went to yumcha at our nearest restaurant. The owner's daughter said she got accepted to one of the specialized high school. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the 2016 election, we have seen Bernie Sanders coming out as a candidate. People liked him because of his populist social rhetoric. However, the DNC rigged the election, causing Trump to win.

Now that Sanders is going to these public forums to understand Trump voters' concerns, people are defecting from Trump to Sanders due to the fact that Trump cares about his cronies and himself and no-one else. Sanders is quite popular based on polling.

I have looking up psychics to see what the future holds. By 2028, there will be two females running for president. By 2029, we expect a New Deal-like plan that helps the people. The GOP is on its deathbed by then after we see how much they screwed the country up.

People know that if we stay with the current capitalist system, it will not make the US better off after the GOP loses it grip. By then, they would follow a socialist system based on Sander's rhetoric. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why There's No Charcoal Yakiniku in the New York Metropolitan Area </TITLE>

<TEXT> Whenever, I think of yakiniku, I think of small pieces of marinated meats on top of an open grill. However, there aren't any restaurants of such that uses charcoal or a shichirin bucket grill.

Around the New York Metropolitan Area, we have Gyukaku, Yakiniku Gen, Yakiniku West, Yakiniku Futago, and Takashi. Gyukaku and Gen uses ceramic charcoal on smokeless grills. West and Futago uses electricity on smokeless grill. Takashi uses electricity on a grill that requires an air duct.

Charcoal is more expensive that electricity and gas. The restaurants in New York may have regulations on using charcoal. Burning charcoal can be hazardous, except when you use binchotan white charcoal. In Japan, it is common to see restaurants using shichirin filled with burning binchotan, with an air duct hanging from the ceiling.

Ceramic charcoal isn't real charcoal. It uses ceramic to produce a good taste when grilling meats. It's quite expensive. These restaurants uses smokeless grills to reduce operating costs. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why the American Dream is Dead </TITLE>

<TEXT> After the 2008 financial crisis, America has turned to the worst. We see rising numbers of the homeless, the shrinking of the middle class, coorporates pocketing from the poor, and the 1/10 of the top 1% having more wealth than the lower 50%.

Before that happened, former President Ronald Reagan caused this mess. His policies ruined the middle class and enriched the top 1%.

Now that Trump became president, there will be crony capitalism that will rip-off the working and middle class. If people chose Sanders, he will definitely revive the American Dream by transforming the government into a socialist democracy.

Currently, the American Dream is the Canadian Dream. We see that in Canada there is universal healthcare similar to Europe and cheap colleges. Mobility there is better than the US. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why I Value Quantity Over Quality </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-14 07:18:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am a person who value quantity over quality. Quantity is cheaper but its grade is lower.

Whenever I choose restaurants, I would rather go to buffets than to go to fine dining restaurants. At buffets, I can eat a lot, but small restaurants have 10 items, while large restaurants have up to 100 items. At fine dining restaurants, I choose what I want to eat and pay for it.

Some fine dining restaurants, however, have lunch specials. These specials allow you to choose several items for one price. This is also a way to save costs.

When using public transportation, I would use transportations that are flat rate rather than using transportations that charge by zoning or by distance. Flat rates are like buffets, which charging by zones or distance is like eating at a fine dining restaurant or a buffet charging by weight. However, flat rate-based transportations can be slower than zone or distance-based transportation.

If I take a railway line that charges by distance and found out that the express trains are cheaper, I will take an express train to the closest station before the destination and the transfer for a local train. I found out that from New York to White Plains, I can take the subway and transfer for Metro North, take the subway and transfer for Greyhound, or take the subway and transfer for the Bee-Line Bus. I found out that the first choice costs me $15 at peak times or $12 at off-peak times; the second choice costs me $6.75 or $7.75; the third choice costs me $2.75 due to the free transfer. The first choice gets me there in 1hr 2min. The second choice get me there in 1hr 35min. The third choice gets me there 2hr 30min. </TEXT>

After the success, I wrote about Cartoon Network and Disney theme songs. These also gained high views. However, these anti-establishment ideas caused butthurt to trolls, saying that I am an insult to the music industry.

I have shown my ideas to my professors. They are just speechless. Some of the faculty members asked my about the singer Kiyoshi Hikawa, which I have known.

<TITLE> Why Tipping in Bad </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Whenever we go to a restaurant in the US, we have to tip after a meal. However, there were a few restaurants that discontinued this practice.

Tipping wasn't necessary until the Great Depression. It short changes  waiters, and doesn't make them work better. The tip varies per party. They lower than the minimum wage this way.

In other countries, tipping is not accepted. You just pay for the meal and services are better. Sometimes, the food costs more and/or the restaurant charges a service charge. If you want to tip a person, you have to mask it and call it something other name than tips. Back in 2011, whenever we take the taxi from the bus terminal to our house, we pay the taxi driver 10 yuan instead of the base 7 yuan, giving him a 42% tip, for helping us with the luggage and having to spend more for gas.

The restaurant Ootoya stopped accepting tips since March 28, 2016. The just raised their prices to compensate the waiter's salaries. The Chinese restaurant Big Noodle Bowl included a service charge on your bill. You don't have to leave tips. The ramen restaurant Ichiran opened a store in Brooklyn. The receipt saids "we are a non-tipping establishment." The bowl of ramen is twice than that in Japan, due to higher market prices in NYC than in Japan. In College Point, NY, there is a buffet restaurant call The Buffet, the online menu shows that there are more than 100+ items. it also says that a 15% service on the price to cover the operating and administrative costs. </TEXT>

In Intermediate Japanese II, the professor always make references about politics. He has shown a video about a sinkhole in Fukuoka, which was fixed overnight. On the day after Trump was elected, he started make references of right-wing groups being open with their ideologies in Japan. When introducing a movie or show, we sometimes shift off a tangent and have a conversation about politics in Japan.

Some teachers avoid talking about politics as they want to stay neutral. However, some do talk about it. Last semester, there is a business law professor that tells the students the truth about our screw-up situations in governments, i.e. money in politics. </TEXT>

Multiple units are several powered trains grouping together to form one train set. This is common on most commuter rail, most regional, all subway, and most high-speed railway services. Such trains have better traction, shorter shunting times, and better acceleration.

Locomotives are power trains that are used to pull unpowered carriages. This is common in heritage railways, some commuter railways, some high-speed railways, freight and some regional railways. They have the ease of replacing the locomotive, safety, and maximum usage of power cars. They are usually work trains used for repair or maintenance work. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In the suburb of Musashi-Ono() between Tokyo and Chiba, there is an half owl-half human 18-year-old named Muneo Yoshikawa(). He recently graduated from high school, but became a freelancer after dropping out of college. He works as a singer-songwriter, game designer, animator, and gamer. One day, he met a monk at a Buddhist temple and receives the power to become a superhero. Thus, Hooman() has been born.

Hooman, however, is an antihero. He believes that evildoers and perpetuators of injustice should be punished with death. He prefers to use a katana to do the dirty job. At times, he is called in to assist executions and get paid to kill people he is ordered to. Every time he kills a person, he uses his victim's blood to create his insignia as a sign that he was there. Due to this ruthless tactic, people call him Hooman the Killer().

During his gaming career, he became friends with a 16-year-old raccoon named Tsunehito Azuma(), who resides in Kawachi-Ota(), a 17-year-old pig named Jin Akai(), who resides in Harima-Tonda() a 19-year-old monkey named Takuya Mutsu(), who resides in Mikawa-Omachi(), and a 20-year-old sparrow named Daisuke Omi(), who resides in Chikuzen-Yamada(). They later became informers to Hooman.

To avoid suspicion, he sends and receives encrypted messages through an app. He receives cash payments in person or use an app to receive money anonymously.

Muneo dislikes corruption, black markets, fraud, and scams. He likes child fornication with condoms, prostitution, gambling, porn, especially shotacons and lolicons, erotic arts, and apologetic murders. He always supports progressive socialist democratic politics. In one scenario, he killed a yakuza boss with cyanide. He is a fan of the 36-year-old populist Socialist democratic dog politician Tsuyoshi Imai(), who was mayor of his suburb. In a bid to be prime minister, the hard-line conservative ideologogue polar bear rival Jiro Kurokawa() won second place.

Hooman became Imai's part-time bodyguard. Whenever Hooman is with Tsuyoshi, he is always seen carrying his katana, wakizashi, and a thick, 100 centimeter-long, detachable kiseru smoking pipe that can turn into a mini machine gun.

Muneo created Min'natube to counteract Everytube's restrictions. The website's terms of service is much more lax and instead of using algorithms, he uses a group of admins to review videos before getting automatically monitarized. Ad revenue started pouring in after corporates appreciate the policies.

Muneo believes that to obtain complete control of the government, the prime minister should bug every dissident. The prime minister, however, is a libertarian. He approves of rising taxes to benefit the people.

After Imai won, Kurokawa arrives at Muneo's house and attempt to kill him in retaliation, but got killed and Muneo painted Hooman's insignia with Kurokawa's blood, and presented Imai Kurokawa's head in order to become his minion. This has caused the rise of identify politics and polarization.

Hooman believes that effective population control can only happen by committing mass murders. This is why the superhero enjoys spree killings with any weapon he uses.

The prime minister used some funding to build the Museum of Heads to document each person Hooman kills. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whenever I eat food, I use condiments sparsely, except for fried food and sushi. I believe that condiments mask the food's original taste when it is cooked.

Whenever I order food in restaurants, the food itself is already cooked in sauce. Adding sauce will masks it's original taste. In some buffets, you have to grab a plate and put what you want to eat on one plate. This is typical to see sauces getting mixed up, except for sushi buffets and yakiniku restaurants. In these restaurants, each item is served in individual plates. In Gyukaku, a chain yakiniku restaurant, all lunch items are served on one plate. You have sauces at your table to dip with. I omit them as the food itself is already flavored. Whenever I order al la carte, I always order the cuts of meat with sauce.

When I eat hotpot, these restaurants will always have a hot pot bar to mix my sauce. I always mix shacha BBQ sauce, peanut sauce, soy sauce, chili oil, sesame oil, sesame sauce, oyster sauce, lemon or ponzu if eating shabu shabu, wasabi if available, cilantro, and welsh onions. I always mix the concoction up and end up with a bowl of red sauce with a combination of everything. I use it to cool down the items I put into the pot.

When I eat sushi, you have wasabi, soy sauce, and ginger, on the table. I only use them on tempura and any sushi pieces, except on gunkan-maki, eel, and some aburi sushi. These pieces are already have sauce on them, so I don't have to dip in soy sauce, but I will use wasabi.

I have eaten zaru soba, which is buckwheat noodles washed in running water before soaking on ice water. This dish is always served with noodle sauce, which is soy sauce boiled with dash bonito stock, sake, and mirin. The noodles itself is tasteless, which is dipped in the sauce before being slurped. The sauce can be drinker by pouring soba water into it.

Fried food, like fries and tortilias chips, are tasteless. These have condiments on the side. For these, I will apply condiments on them. Plantains itself have taste on them, so there's no condiment.

Whenever I go out to enjoy my grandma's birthday or Chinese New Year, there will be appetizers of pickles and salted peanuts. These are  already flavored. There will always be a cup of chili and mustard for people who likes to eat spicy food. While I was in China for vacation in 2011 at a restaurant in my hometown, there was be a cup of soy sauce that is spiced with wasabi. </TEXT>

<TEXT> During the Summer of 2011, I went back to China for vacation. On the final hours on the flight to Hong Kong, I had a stomachache that cause me to lose my appetite.

When we arrived the airport, we ordered congee and was able to defecate. On the toilet, I made a mess, which made the janitor rant about the mess.

When I arrived to my hometown, at times, after enjoying a meal, I ended up having to take a dump. Turns out that we are not accustomed of the local food.

The worst mess I made was after snaking on spiced sunflower seeds, I had to rush to my uncle's home to use his toilet. The toilet was small, making it hard to squat on. My feces ended up smearing on the wall. My uncle cleaned up the mess I made, saying that it is due to my digestion.

At the nearest restaurant near my home where we take the buses to get to the Hong Kong International Airport, we reserved a private room. Every time we come here, we spend 600 yuan every time we eat there. In the room, I defecated on the sides of the squat toilet. I told my dad, but didn't inform the workers. </TEXT>

<TITLE> NYC Subway vs. Tokyo Metro/Toei </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-04 02:25:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There are differences between NYC subway vs. Tokyo Metro/Toei. I will covering several significant points I found.

When riding the trains during rush hour, trains are usually crowded. Passengers would always have to squeeze into the train until there's no space. The doors will not fully close as there will more passengers squeezing through closed doors. In Tokyo, passengers would have to be pushed into the train until there's no space. Trains have to come in close proximity to each other.

The fare is a flat rate with a free transfer within 2 hours. In Tokyo, the fare is distance-based with a transfer fee for the two systems.

The rolling stock receives electricity via third rail. The older trains (RXX) require announcements from the conductor. The newer trains (RXXX) have automatic announcements and a strip map or the FIND systems that displays the stations the train will stop. In Tokyo, the older trains (XX series) use a strip map but the 01 and 02 series use third rail while the newer train (XXXX and XXXXX series) have LED screens that displays the stations the train will stop and use overhead lines. Each train have a designated colored strip to indicate which line the train runs on.

The subway system does not offer direct service to other commuter rail. In Tokyo, there are direct service into commuter rail lines without having to transfer. The pro of this service is that it's convenient and leads to less crowding. The con of this service is that it can be confusing. One would have to look at the train announcements in the stations to see their destinations and notes regarding it's service.

We use the metrocard to enter the subway, which will be replace with smart cards that is implemented in PATH. In Tokyo, one will have to get a ticket or use a smart card to enter.

Each station have a train countdown clocks, which is new. There are travel stations that announces planned service changes or delays. In Tokyo, there are train announcements that displays the arrival times of the next trains.

Trains can run express in one borough but become local in another. In Tokyo, the Tozai, Fukutoshin, Asakusa, and Shinjuku lines have their own express services, which local and express have their own different direct service destinations into commuter railway lines.

The subway operates 24/7 with limited services during late night. There are maintenance work during midday and weekend, until the fastrack program was implanted, where maintenance work is done during late night. In Tokyo, the subway doesn't operate between 12am and 5am for maintenance services. By then, people would have to drive or to use buses.

The map doesn't code each station for tourists. There are posters of planned service changes in English, Spanish, Korean, Chinese, Hindi, Russian, and Creole. In Tokyo, each station are coded for tourists. Train announcements are made in Japanese and English. The ticket machines have English, Chinese and Korean versions. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Riding the Newark Light Rail </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Came here to ride on the light rail after having the lunch rodizilo at Brasilia Grill. The fare is cheaper than the NYC subway, the PATH, and the Hudson-Bergen light rail.

When the tram arrived, the Broad St-bound car left first. The tram car opened the door to pick up more passengers. The Grove St route is fast and doesn't share any of its segments on public roads, compared to the Broad St line. In Japan, this kind of tram line wouldn't be consider a tram line, rather a railway line.

At Grove St, there aren't a lot of passengers as the terminal is outside Newark. At Penn Station, the trains terminate at the side platform where we exit. It's like a balloon loop for trams, especially during the weekends. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Today, I had a Financial Accounting Midterm. Before taking the midterm, I went to tutoring at the SACC. We asked questions and use logical reasoning to solve them.

The last time I took the midterm, I did poorly and have to drop the class. The subway was delayed due to a thief getting side-swiped by a train operating on the opposite direction of the thief. This almost got me late to the exam. There were a set of questions that require me bubble in more than one answer.

This time, when I came to take the midterm, the professor lets us omit the last three questions, one of them being an extra credit question. I was able to understand most of the questions. There were 97 question to be answered in 140 minutes, giving us about 86.5 seconds to answer each question.

I was able to finish the exam 30 minutes before time is up. Upon leaving the lecture hall, the professor shook my hand.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> During my time at the intermediate school near my house, I used BrainPop in some of my classes. BrainPop is a educational website that is hosted by Tim and Moby.

The teachers in the school uses this to introduce a new subject. The videos range from 3 to 5 minutes. There is a 10-question quiz after each video, which is useful when my 8th grade science teacher uses the quiz grades for extra credit.

Later, BrainPop included ESL hosted by Ben, Jr. hosted by Annie, Education for teachers and parents, and Gameup for educational games. A subscription is required to gain full access, which the intermediate school lapsed during 7th grade. The social studies teachers signed up a free trial offer before the school renewed it.

Now that I am an adult, I have though of parodying it in a future short on Cyanide and Happiness or featuring Tim and Moby in a skit on Robot Chicken, where Moby gives a golden shower to Tim. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why America Capitalism is Flawed </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> America, compared to Canada and any EU county, is capitalistic. We see social class divide between the poor and the rich, and the decline of the middle class. We are seeing college graduates being underemployed or unemployed.

We know that in a capitalistic society, there will be competition and and a social class hierarchy. We see people living in college debt. In a socialist society, everyone have a fair chance of succeed. There is universal health care and college.

Ever since the 2008 recession, America have turned to the worst. Umployment rose, incomes stagnate, corporations became rich, and the social gap has widened.

2016 was a pivotal point in US history. We see that people appreciate Sanders ideologies. However, the DNC rigged to election that caused Trump to become the next president after Obama. The US became polarized and California wanted to secede from the union. Currently the twitter handle bluexit became a trend and the 20 blue states will want to. These 20 blues will likely follow Sander's ideologies.

If Sanders was to become the next president instead of Trump, we would see a radical change with socialist reforms and the US would be much better off than with Trump. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A Spin-off or Derivative of Niyandar Kamen </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-19 18:20:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have thought of a possible spin-off or derivative of Niyandar Kamen. This one is an alternative world of the original show. I originally thought of calling it Nyago's Adventure Time(), but due to possible copyright issues, I changed it to The Wanderer of the Skeleton Capital(). Now, the spin-off is called Shin'nosuke the Adventurer().

In this spin-off, there was a nuclear war. The effect of the war killed off every cat in the process. The main character, originally Nyago, will be called Shin'nosuke Yanagawa(). His parents gave him up to an anthropomorphic morphing pteranodon's family for safety reasons.

15 years after the event, we see Shin'nosuke at the age of 20 with his adoptive pteranodon brother Hideto Tomita(). Shinosuke seen possessed a katana and wakizashi daisho pair on his belt on pants. He also has a black backpack. Hideto have a job which Shin'nosuke is a freelancer.

The setting resembles a samurai town with Edo-period building and a castle. The skeleton king is now a figurehead and all ruling power goes to a shogun or generalissimo, who rules like a prime minister. Each district in the skeleton capital ruled by a mayor who gets elected by the people themselves (Japanese government systems reference). In addition, there are fragments of Cat Town.

Hideto will have a girlfriend who resembles a Chinese deity who can speak Cantonese. He also have a tanuki cousin Hayato Saiki(), who told Shin'nosuke that his parents were unlikely while there is a diaspora of other cats he have known.

The episodes would usually be about Shin'nosuke and Hideto's adventures. These sometimes have to deal with aggressive yakuza gangs, with Shin'nosuke hanging out at their gambling dens, as gambling is forbidden (Japanese gambling law and chanbara references).

The show will make references to jidaigeki samurai dramas and lampoons non-Japanese fighting styles. In one scene, Shin'nosuke fights with his katana one his right hand with the sheath on the left hand (Chinese wuxia reference). In another scene, Shin'nosuke fight with a wakizashi with a cooking pot lid as a shield (Okinawan timbe-rochin reference). In a third scene, Shin'nosuke is working as a bodyguard for a yakuza faction dressed up in a suit. In the final fight with a bodyguard of a rival yakuza faction in yojimbo attire, Shin'nosuke throws his katana at the bodyguard, which the bodyguard deflects, and draws his wakizashi (Makoto Fujita's Kenkaku Shobai reference).

After the first shogun retires, another shogun was elected and this one is unruly. He created rules by mingling with the commoners to understand their situations. He also has two bodyguards who also work as informants (Abarenbo Shogun The Unruly Shogun reference). His name will be Muneyuki Awaya().

There is a group of assassins-for-hire. The oldest assassin passed away, so the group needed a new assassin. That's when Shin'nosuke join. There are already four assassins: a red fox police officer by the name of Shigeru Hinoki(), a raccoon restaurant owner and chef by the name of Atsushi Aoi(), a blue jay freelance graphics designer by the name of Tadashi Sugi(), and a female European rabbit police officer who is an informer for the assassins who is also a freelance geisha by the name of Tomoe Hara(). The deceased assassin was a retired eagle officer by the name of Naomori Fuji().

The victims get reminded by Mitsuko to go to a secret hideout and leave 10,000 yen. The group of five split up the payment and prepare themselves for the assassin. Shigeru uses a katana, Atsushi uses a whip with a snake head at the end, and Tadashi uses a needle that can reach to the heart.

It seems that Shin'nosuke is the only last cat in the Skeleton Capital. However, his grandfather went into hiding during the war and later become a godfather. When an another godfather encroached into his territory, Shin'nosuke fought off the underlings. The godfather's name is Takashi Ono(); before the war, it was Saburo Yanagawa(). After Shin'nosuke found out Takashi was his grandfather, Shin'nosuke vows to protect him.

One notable recurring character that will be featured is a governor who is an adult Anpanman resembling Oda Nobunaga by the name of Naganobu Osawa(). Shinnosuke is in town, hears a commoner's concern's, then informs Naganobu of a situation. They then seek new updates of the situation. After the perpetrators of the injustice are identified, Shinnosuke dispatches the henchman, while Naganobu dispaches the perpetrators.

Ever since Shin'nosuke was adopted, he never forgot his long lost sister. When Shin'nosuke and Naganobu stop a bank heist, Tomoe and a female coworker came to arrest the robbers. The coworker happened to be his sister by the name of Azami Fujiwara(), 18 years old. She and Tomoe are coworkers, and currently a detective. Her preferred weapon is an shikomigasa which consists a hidden sword inside the stick, a spearhead at the tip of the umbrella inside the spike, and the ferrules act like a sawblade when spun.

While confronting the suspect in a murder case, she had a shootout when she got shot, ending up in a coma. Shin'nosuke and Tomoe blame themselves for arriving late.

After a few years of meeting her, Tomoe invited Azami, Shin'nosuke and their grandfather to her wedding. In the wedding, Tomoe's ex crashed the wedding, threatening to kill the groom. Shin'nosuke confronts the ex and ends up slaying the ex in the fight.

The team of assassins once slain the commissioner for child molestation without a condom, who was dating Azami. After realizing that he was the molester, she received death threats. The commissioner was acquitted for his crimes. After realizing the mayor was also violated, she pays the assassins. 

Come to think of this spin-off, I have thoughts of this being a rip off as some of the contents are similar to Adventure Time.

I want to air the spin-off on YouTube if TV Nippon rejects the spin-off. If the spin-off can get aired on YouTube, a season would be from May 8 to March 1. If it gets accepted by TV Nippon, then a season lasts all year long. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lately, there was an election in the Netherlands. Wilders lost the election to Rutte.

According to one news article, people voted for Rutte as they realize the effect of Trump being president and Brexit. This shows that people realize what would happen if Wilders was to be elected. The election is also a turning point of identity politics.

There will be a election in France to determine if Le Pen will become the next president. If Wilders won, Le Pen would have ultimately won.

With the remaining EU states choosing hope over hate, Trump will be rendered useless. He will become a laughingstock for what EU experienced during Berlusconi's regime. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why Blue States Will Be Generous </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Lately, we heard news of Trump's deplorable budget cuts. These cuts will hurt the red states more. However, some GOP members are skeptical of the budget because the budget underfunds popular social programs and is unfair.

Putting more money into the military and national security is meaningless. We will be engaging in unnecessary and disastrous fighting that will cost the military and civilians lives. Mass deportations and incarceration will hurt local economies.

However, blue states will counteract the budget cuts. They will raise their own taxes to fund programs people wanted, i.e. universal healthcare and free college. People will be happy and will see that the congress is out-of-touch and don't care about their proposals.

People in red states will suffer. They will vote their senators and representatives out and replace them with ones that will give them social programs they wanted. Otherwise, there will be an exodus of the poor, marginalized, and the minority into blue states, giving them more tax revenue.

Update: In New York, the state government passed a budget that offers working and middle-class families free public colleges, starting Fall 2017. </TEXT>

When a costumer enters a restaurant, they order some food and receive a password to the wifi printed on the receipt or written on the take-out menus. This is useful for a person who needs to get work done.

When a person needs to use a phone to look up some information, they don't have to use their network internet. Using the free wifi can save precious cellular data one can use per month. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Trump Plans to Blames Democrats for Republicare if it Fails </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-10 02:05:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The congress is planning to replace the ACA with Republicare, which costs more that covers less. We already saw how ACA is flawed as we see high premiums.

The ACA was implemented in 2010. The insurance plan was derived from Ronmeycare which backlashed in Massachusetts. We saw the number of people employed in the plan reaching 11 million. In a leaked email in Wikileaks, if Clinton was president, she would dismantle Obamacare and replace it with a universal health care system, similar to what is offered in Europe.

With the Republicare replacing ACA, 10 million will lose insurance and it will basically backfire. Trump said that if the plan fails, which is likely, he will blame Democrats. It's not logical, as Democrats wouldn't support it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lately, we heard news of republicans ignoring their constituents. This is a good thing as the constituents realize what deplorable and regressive proposals they are making. People will do anything to stop them. Even Sanders like what the constituents are doing. Rep. Peter King of New York said that he's refusing to do town halls because "angry protesters 'diminish democracy'." That's not true, as he constituents are practicing their freedom of speech.

However, some republicans did not skip out on their town halls. They have to balls to clarify their intentions and/or tell them what they want. The constituents are sharing with the republicans what President Obama did for them, especially what ACA has to offer to them. Others would try to silence the constituents with arrest. These people are unlikely to be stoppable.

If the republicans goes forward with their deplorable and regressive proposals, the constituents will vote them out next year. </TEXT>

Turns out the neighborhoods neighboring New Jersey are liberal while the other neighborhoods are conservative. The bus is very crowded as one of it's terminal is the St. George terminal. The ride took 56 minutes as the express buses are available during the PM rush and the buses do not stop at the restaurant.

During the bus ride, the driver turned on red at the corner of Liberty and Forrest. While on Forrest Ave, I saw a cone at an intersection. I saw a diversity of business on the road. There are several strip malls on the road; the restaurant I want to go to is in one of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We saw the rise of the alt-right in late 2015 after Trump announced his presidential run. They originated from the Silicon Valley. They have far-right ideologies.

One prominent person who represent the alt-right is Milo Yiannopoulus, who used to work at Breitbart. He is known for his trolling activities on Twitter. A few days ago, he was fired for his pedophilia comments.

After Trump won the 2016 election, there is an article from Wired called "The Alt-Right Will Fail. Even under President Trump." Trump even said he will have an America First policy. However, we see how America First became Trump First. We saw his conflicts of interest and his special interests. I see he might end up quitting or not able to get a second term

With the Trump presidency falling apart and the dismissal of Milo Yiannopoulous, we will see a silver lining. Maybe people are owing up to themselves. </TEXT>

My dad, aunt, and uncle started paying the joint TV service. Eventually, my aunt and uncle quit the plan. Leaving my did having to pay the plan. He started downgrade his subscription from premium, where I used to watch from Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, to basic. Until 2009, we see the number of available channels for our basic service dropping.

After dropping Spike TV and seeing our crappy service, we decided to cancel our subscription. That's when we later got TV service via a digital antenna.

The phone service consists of us connecting our phone to a land line. We see our bill raising. We eventually have to cancel add-ons to our phone service. When we realize adding a line to our T-Mobile Service is cheaper that having the phone service, a crew member helped us cancel our Verizon membership and transfer our home phone to T-Mobile. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lately, Michael Flynn got fired for leaking secrets to Russia. This offense violates the espionage acts. If found guilty, he is liable to life imprisonment.

Trump started his presidency with a low approval rating. It took him 8 days to surpass the 50% mark. This shows that he is very unfavorable. His travel ban was unconstitutional and had to be rescinded. He didn't make America great but made SNL great. SNL had portrayed the administration as "incompetent buffoons."

With Trump's imploding approval rations due to the event, the GOP can able to try to impeach Trump, but likely fail, which will hurt them in 2018. By 2018, we may possible see the Democrats taking over the congress. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lately, I heve heard of news that the insiders in the White House said that Trump apparently hates his job. There are several good reason for this.

As Cenk Uygar said in a video Why Trump Won't Win 2020, he represents the four horsemen: personal corruption, systemic corruption, incompetence, and hubris. When his approval rating reaches 25% or lower, we will be in danger zone, where Trump does not accept his mistakes and scapegoats others.

Trump is a egoistical narcissist, who is full of himself. He doesn't care about the people who voted for him, but cares about himself. He doesn't divest his businesses, leading to the conflict of interests. His cabinet members are top donors who are billionaires.

Trump signed an executive order to ban Muslims from entering. However, it backfired as it was rescinded by the court. I am seeing that Trump's policies will backfire and Trump would have to blame his opponents.

The local governments feel that the Congress is out-of-touch, so they will have to do their job. Recently, another The Young Turks video surfaced that San Francisco is offering free community colleges to its residents. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Dragon Tales Skits in Robot Chicken </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-09 18:22:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Dragon Tales is a kid show that was aired between 1999 and 2005 on PBS Kids. The show is about Max, Emmy and Enrique's adventures in Dragonland, where they meet up with Ord, Cassie, Zac and Whezzie. 

Robot Chicken is a adult-themed show that is airing since 2005 on Adult Swim. The show consists of skits of other shows, but would need licensing.

One Dragon Tales skits I want to see on Robot Chicken is where the kids arrive at Dragonland. When they arrived, they see Ord anal-tailing Cassie, where Ord inserts his tail into Cassie's anus, while Cassie is using painkillers to enjoy the experience painlessly. The kids were in shock.

Another skit I want to see is where Dr. Booboogone have a side job as a madam. Quetzel goes to the underground brothel and have sexual services from a hooker.

A third skit I want to see is where Cassie's siblings in a gang bang. In the gang bang, they are seen using lube, condoms and dildos. However, all they are doing is just pelvic thrusting without anal contract. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Birds On My Backyard Decking </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> From time to time, I see birds on the backyard decking. The decking also have a roof deck, which is ideal for birds to avoid the rain.

My parents sometimes hear birds cooing inside the bedroom. They usually wait for the neighbors to bring food for the birds. Sometimes, the birds even cry to call the neighbor.

Birds like doves, sparrows and ravens use the decking as a place to rest. My dad saw bird poop near my window. Whenever it rains, they will rest at my windowsill. I like to see them grooming.

The only type of birds that do not use the decking are pigeons, robins, and cardinals. Pigeons are large and prefer buildings. Robins and cardinals are seasonal birds that come during the warmer seasons. During Spring, these birds prefer public parks to claim territory. By Summer, they will fight over a mate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I become interested in Japanese culture when I immigrated to the US. Recently, my fanarts are anti-establishment as I included crossovers of non-anime characters.

Enka is a Japanese song genre that resembles ballads. I am not a fan of pop songs. Some anime theme songs do fit the genre of J-pop. I'm more of a fan of contemporary tastes. There are some anime theme songs that fit the genre of enka, but are rare. I myself wrote numerous enka-themed anime songs. The songs can be politically incorrect and contains katakana, which is not common in enka.

I have typed up ideas for taking a short-lived children's anime and turn it to a liberal rip-off of South Park. Children's anime are traditionally moralistic, teaching children how to behave as good and considerate people and helping them to stay on the right path in life. However, the anime Crayon Shin-chan is considered vulgar that has been criticized for having non-age appropriate content. The revival would be considered an adult anime even though the characters are mostly minors. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Recent Kitchen Nightmare Closures </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Speaking of Kitchen Nightmares, the show ended in 2014 when Chef Garden Ramsey called it quits. Currently, 72% of his restaurant closed.

The first resent restaurant to close down was Mojito in Brooklyn, New York. It closed last March. The Facebook post said that they are opening the new chapter and thanking their staff and patrons after 13 years in service. Looks like they don't want to continue the restaurant.

The second resent restaurant to close down was The Secret Garden in Moorpark, California. It also closed last March. It is possible that the restaurant closed due to declining customers and that he reverted back to the old menu after Ramsey left. Currently, he is suspected in working at Custom Pie in Moorpark.

The third recent restaurant that closed down was Nino's in Long Beach, California. This restaurant was a 54 years old restaurant when it was first introduced. The owner Nino just goes around tells every "My name is Nino!" It closed in August. The owners closed it in August due to the longing to retire than to pass it down.

The fourth recent restaurant that closed down was Barefoot Bob's in Hull, Massachusetts. The restaurant is busy during the Summer months while empty during the Winter months. Right after Ramsey left, the owners reverted back to the old styles. They closed in December possibly to poor reviews, piling debts, or wanting to close this chapter. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Bernie Sanders vs. Saburo Kitajima </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-01 02:25:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Senator Bernie Sanders and singer-songwriter Saburo Kitajima are veteran characters of their respective careers. I appreciate these two for what they have contributed to society.

Bernie Sanders was from Brooklyn, New York born in 1941. I recently saw his hardships where he was part of the MLK civil rights march, which is unheard of. He represented the Liberty Union Party before becoming an independent, making him an underrated politician.

Saburo Kitjima was from Hokkaido, Japan born in 1936 before moving to Tokyo to start his singing career. He started his career at Nippon Columbia in 1962 before moving to Nippon Crown in 1963. In 1973 he started his music agency with 5 disciples, one of them being his son-in-law. Before his son and an Indian singer were disciples.

Sanders could have won if the DNC didn't cheat. If he won, we would expect his social programs implanted right away. He doesn't rule out running for 2020.

Kitajima retired from the New Year NHK Kohaku Gassen in 2013. In late August of last year, he fell down in the bathroom due to cervical spondylosis myelopathy. In November, he had a surgery. During his time in rehabilitation, he released two songs that he composed by himself and one being sang by himself and the other sang by one of his disciples. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every year, we go out to have a fancy dinner every Chinese New Year Eve. We went to a restaurant in Flushing, Queens. By 6pm, getting there is slow due to heavy traffic.

My grandma makes the reservation. The reservation had to be done one month in advance. Originally we were a group of 11 but became a group of 6. When we entered, there were many waiting to be seated as they didn't have a reservation. 

We waited for a waiter to take our order. We wrote down a list items to be ordered beforehand. The first five order came right away, while the last three took a while to come out. When people who didn't have a reservation sat down. They waited a while for their food to come.

We also have a bad Chinese New Year Eve Dinner. Last year, we went to a restaurant in Elmhurst, Queens. The food took a while. We ended up having to cancel some of our orders. The waiters weren't serious in working. It turns out the owner whom my dad know had a stroke.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am unhappy with the Democrats. Some Senate Democrats have voted in favor of Trump's cabinet picks. This is why I can't trust them.

The Democrats are corporate Democrats, people who are backed by big donors. They believe what these companies believe in, not the people themselves. During the presidential run, I supported Hillary before supporting Sanders. Sanders gained support from the voters themselves.

In response of that, several alternative news networks like The Young Turks and Secular Talk created an anti-establish, populist third party called Justice Democrats, which is backed by Sanders supporters. In these three days, it became a real success. They have 90,000 supporters and have 90,000 candidates to be their party leaders. In my social media accounts, I added "Hail Sanders" and "Sanders Banzai()" in protest to the Trump presidency.

I nominated two candidates, one who is from Queens, NY and a progressive from Bethany, CN. </TEXT>

<TEXT> During Bush's tenure, we have seen 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, The Great Recession, the decay of civil rights, and the erosion of civil liberty.

We all felt that Bush was the worst president of all time due to his incompetence, corruption, and hubris. In the 2000 election, Bush won the electoral college, while losing the popular vote.. In the 2004 election, Kerry felt that Bush rigged the election.

In 2016, we saw Trump winning in a landslide. His rhetoric is more aggressive than Bush. His cabinet will be worst than Bush. We will see Trump's corruption, incompetence, and hubris. His policies will get dangerous worst than Bush.

If Trump wins 2020, the stock market bubble will burst and will blame others for the crash. He will implode and do more damage that previously thought. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't turn on the tv for the day. I chose to synthesize with the representatives who will not attend the inauguration.

I am unhappy with what will be our new future in the next 4 years. I am seeing from a psychic that Trump may not get a second term, but the next president after him will be a hard-line conservative. By then, our states will ignore the Capitol and act autonomically when the cuts gets passed. Looks like Trump is more of a libertarian, more to the right than the GOP.

I am unhappy with Sanders attending the inauguration, but his jacket was appropriate for the occasion. I favor him over Clinton after Trump winning the election. I see that he is still popular among his supporters. He could have won if Hillary and the DNC didn't rig the primaries.

I have heard that if Trump get impeached or resign, Pence will replace him, which the GOP favors more. If he get assassinated, Pence will replace him and there will be a civil war.

Trump reminds Italians of Berlusconi. Berlusconi, like Trump, was a populist. They have conflicts of interest, scandals, and are unfavorable. We will likely see the same things all over again. I have seen YouTube videos of Berlusconi as a laughingstock. He has antagonizes others, i.e. calling Obama "suntanned", so have Trump during the presidential campaign.

Now that the mayoral election is this November, if Hillary runs, I will vote for her. She can deal with Trump better than de Blasio. If she wins, Trump will be walking on eggshells. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As we all know, Trump's inauguration will be tomorrow. His approval rating is significantly lower than previous presidents.

During the presidential campaign, we see that Trump is running as a populist. He won the election, as Hillary was incompetent and Trump was like Sanders. However, now that he is adding alligators into the swamp, his approval rating dropped.

We will likely see our social and environment programs in the crossroads. This is when people will be outraged and local governments will divert tax money to create their own social programs. The states will run autonomically, not giving tax money to the federal government.

Trump is like the four horseman, where he have personal corruption (i.e. taking campaign money to put his sons into private schools), systemic corruption (i.e. having alligators in the swamp), incompetence (i.e. his father bailing him out), and hubris (i.e. claiming that shooting someone on 5th street will not losing supporters).

With this in mind, Trump's approval rating will plummet to 25% or less eventually. The Democrats and some moderate Republicans can use this to fight fire with fire. </TEXT>

Trump isn't a popular president due to his conflicts of interest and his cabinet picks. This will threaten the supporters and national security. If a major attack happens due to Trump's neglect of security briefing, freedom can be compromised, but affect the red states, as the blue states are practicing autonomy from the union.

<TITLE> My Ideas of an Adult-themed Anpanman </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-18 04:23:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> You may know who Anpanman is. If you didn't know, Anpanman is a bread-headed superhero who help others by giving a part of his head to them. However, this journal entry will be about this adult spin-off of this kid show.

Anpanman will be an anti-hero, who will have side jobs where he will spill blood that includes, but not limited to the executioner, hitman, assassin, and killer.


This spin-off will be called Anpanman and Friends(). Each episode doesn't have to center on the titular character Anpanman. In the possible Adult Swim dub, each episode will only have one word, even if the word is general.

The episodes are usually parodies of existing series or left-sided views of controversial topics, like abortion and political incorrectness. The show has various settings and possibly using the settings as a world battleground.

The first episode will be called "Honor." The first episode has contents of an honor killing. Mija's parents arranged her to stay with a boyfriend they found for her. After Mija found out, she then secretly has a lesbian relationship with a friend. Later Mija rejects the boyfriend. Her parents threaten her that if she rejects the next boyfriend she will die. Mija runs to her lesbian girlfriend. For the next few days, she stays at the lesbian girlfriend's place. Sensing something was suspicious, her parents hire Anpanman to spy on her. After knowing that Mija has a lesbian girlfriend, Anpanman informs Mija's parents about it. They ordered Anpanman to kill her. Later, she receives a message telling her to arrive at an alley. When Mija arrives at the alley, Shokupan and Currypanman grabs her arms. Anpanman kills her with a chainsaw.

The spin-off would include violence. In one episode, there is a setting in the show where two potential candidates to be president are selected. In this elections, whoever is able to kill 100 people first wins (WWII reference). The winner, who felt that the contest wasn't enough, goes on a killing spree, killing those who just committed a crime.

Sometimes, some episodes would use characters from other shows as guests. In one episode, Phineas will become a yakuza boss and ends up dying to the hands of Pyon-kichi, an anthropomorphic rabbit. Kabao, an anthropomorphic hippo, shoots Phineas during the turf war.

The shows will parody pop culture. In one episode, Anpanman is with Niyandar Kamen and Yanase Bunny, where they spoof Mito-komon(). Yanase Bunny takes the name of Otsu Kunimitsu() or Tosa-komon(), Anpanman takes the name of Oshima Saburobei(), and Niyandar Kamen takes the name of Ohama Saburoemon(). They suspect a highway magistrate operating an illegal whorehouse where kidnapped girls used as sex slaves. Saburobei pays for the tayu as to understand the working conditions of the whorehouse. In the end, the trio confronts the magistrate with a censor.

In another episode, Melonpanna gets neglected by her sister Rollpanna. She later seduces Ferb to seek love, which eventually cause Ferb to get a boner. Melonpanna pulls down her pants and starts rubbing her buttcracks on Ferb's boner. Rollpanna then caught Melonpanna in the act. Later that night, the Panna sisters lay on top of each other in a 69 style, licking each other's butt cracks (Rocko's Modern Life reference).

Margaret Smith comes to town to create the first news network. However, in one scene, Anpanman is peeping at Margaret in a shower with Creampanda scrubbing her boobs with a sponge (Ren and Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon reference).

The Pines twins arrive via a portal. During their time in the town, many misadventures happen. They include, but not limited to Horrorman fondling with Mabel, Cheese licking Dipper's ass in the night, Creampanda constantly screaming after seeing Anpanman and Mabel licking each other's asses in a 69 position (Family Guy reference), the dolphin Beso spewing cum on Dipper's ass, and Burger Kid's horse acting horny when he approaches Mabel on the beach.

Anpanman and his gang go to the Land of Ooo for vacation. In one scene, Fionna is see licking Mimi-sensei on her neck, with Mimi-sensei's students watching Fionna sexually stimulating Mimi-sensei. 

There will be an episode called "Elwood," where Anpanman and his gang goes to Arthur's hometown. One misadventure that will happen is when Baikinman imitating fellatio with Kate with a dildo and Arthur giving self-head.

Anpanman will have a homosexual relation with Niyandar Kamen. In one episode, Anpanman and Niyandar Kamen splash soapy water onto Baikinman, causing Baikinman to shrink, and insert him into Niyandar Kamen's anus. Inside the anus, Baikinman see's various items inside it.

The spin-off will include blasphemy. In one episode, Baikinman says "bismillah." Later that night, Allah appears and beats the shit out of him. Other characters start to have the same situation. In another episode, Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction, manifests in Godzilla form, destroying anything in its path. After every attempt to destroy the Godzilla Shiva fails, Anpanman asks God to sent out a death ray to destroy the Godzilla Shiva.

Whenever Anpanman is ordered to execute, he is paid by the cruelty of the methods he uses. In on instance, he uses a chainsaw to execute. An another instance, he throws an inmate into a helicopter's choppers. In a third instance, he uses a new sword to test on an inmate. In one case, he executes an innocent inmate. Later than night, he had a nightmare where he is escorted by the demonic Momotaro and Kintaro to Enma, the God of Death. He was forbidden to eat meat for seven days as punishment. After this, there is a priest at every execution to purify the inmate's souls.

The spin-off would have to air on YouTube or Hulu depending on the terms of use as the spin-off would's be suitable for TV. A typical season is from October 4 to August 1. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Ideas of an Adult-themed Niyandar Kamen </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Mighty Cat Masked Niyandarn() is a kid show that aired on February 6, 2000, to September 30, 2001. The original creator is the late Anpanman creator Takashi Yanase. The show is about the anthropomorphic cat superhero Niyandar Kamen in Cat Town.

In this revival, three characters will get killed by the superhero: Jabu-jabu, the cleaner, Sarakichi, the kappa, and Demonga, the flying squirrel ninja.

Jabu-jabu gets a nightmare where the superhero beats the crap out of him with an oar (Ren and Stimpy reference) for sleeping with his sister Miko. After the nightmare, Jabu-jabu goes on a psychotic fit and goes on a killing spree. When he is about to kill Miko, Niyandar Kamen arrives duels him. For the last blow, Niyandar Kamen leaps into the sky and slices the cleaner in half from head to toe and splits in half.

Demonga steals Niyandar's magical sword and goes around the town killing random pedestrians, preferably schoolgirls (Abarenbo Shogun The Unruly Shogun reference). Niyandar's immortal mentor warned him that if he does not retrieve the sword within a week, he will stop to exist. Niyandar then seeks help from Anpanman. After catching up with the ninja, Niyandar slits his throat and inserts a C4 before Anpanman detonating the bomb, where Demonga's body blown up in half from the explosion, with blood splashing everywhere, even on Anpanman and Niyandar Kamen's bodies. Anpanman receives the sword. The mentor appears and congratulates Niyandar.

Sarakichi goes to town and molests girls in the night. When the kappa seen by Miko splashing cum on to her, she summons the superhero, where the superhero beats the crap out of the kappa with his hard katana sheath before beheading the kappa. Niyandar takes the head and drops it at Ginko's head.

Three characters I would add to replace the three Niyandar Kamen killed would be an adopted child who has down syndrome whose biological mother gave birth to her after she got raped by her brother, a BBW, and the mayor.

The mayor is authoritative social liberal, who have Sander-like policies and conducts Stalin-line executions. The laws enacted in the town are lax, where he legalizes incest, bestiality, necrophilia, drug use, prostitution, and murder. He believes that sex crime are legal is a condom is used. Murder needs to have a eyewitness to be justifiable. In the mayor's office, there is an execution room, where conservatives are to be executed. After Niyandar Kamen helps the mayor behead 100 dissidents with his katana, he became the mayor's minion.

The mentor in one episode gives Niyandar the ability to detach his head from his shoulder at will. I have seen images of Anpanman without his head.

In a movie, several of his rivals wants to be the next mayor. He uses Niyandar Kamen as a hitman. When these deaths were noticeable, two constables were asked to find a killer. After confronting the mayor, Niyandar Kamen arrives in time to justify his motives. They later found out that the rivals create a nationalistic party and Niyandar Kamen needs to dissolve the party to prevent fascism.

The superhero Niyandar Kamen will be seen having a homosexual relationship with Anpanman. There will be a running gag where when Niyandar Kamen is with Anpanman, they act gay. In the first episode, Anpanman arrives in town. After he meets Niyandar Kamen after he summoned, they went to Niyandar Kamen's house. In the house, they were engaging in homosexual acts, i.e. kissing each other.

Nyago, Niyandar Kamen's alter ego, will become a sword tester, testing the sharpness of other people's sword by using them on unwanted children. In one episode, a police comptroller received a new sword and used it to kill a peddler, nicking it in the process (another Abarenbo Shogun The Unruly Shogun reference). The comptroller hired a polisher to polish the sword, who later saw the nick. Nyago got instructed by the comptroller to chop an unwanted baby in half to test the sword, which broke in the process. The comptroller kills the polisher. Niyandar helped the polisher's child to seek vengeance by having the child kill the comptroller with the broken sword.

Nyago is a student at the town's elementary school. His teacher will get a boob job, which will cause Nyago to get wet dreams from looking them. The teacher later uses her breasts to behead three robbers with her breast milk.

The first wet dream Nyago will have is where he is a peeping tom, peeping at his teacher zipping her dress, where her boobs slip out. The second wet dream Nyago will have is after seeing her teacher's boob bounce, he gets bounded on a bed and her teacher slaps his face with her boobs. The third wet dream Nyago will have is where he is a toddler in Gumball's clothing weeping. After his teacher appears, the teacher holds him and breastfeeds him.

In the original version, Nyago's mom is an off-screen character which his father is absent. In the revival, his mom is a hermaphrodite and his dad is a womanizer. His mom was born with a penis and two scrotums. After they became useless, Nyago cuts them off with a garden shear. Dad is a principal of Nyago's school. He once had a sexual relationship with Nyago's teacher.

Nyago has three friends, Nyako, Kyacchin, and Nyanta. Kyacchin is a child prodigy who can make sake in his house and can give abortions with a bayonet attached to a rifle (WWII reference).

After Sarakichi gets killed and Ginko, his friend, receives his severed head, she becomes a streetwalker. In one episode, she gets whored by Mordecai the blue jay. After CJ caught Mordecai whoring Ginko, she damages Nyago's house in a fit of rage.

Niyandar Kamen will own swords, which will be seen in Nyago's bedroom. The reason the superhero process a katana and wakizashi set is that I want to pay homage to jidaigeki samurai dramas.

In one episode, Rick and Morty end up here. Morty ends up being a pervert and eventually inserts his detached eye into Miko's anus to record her digestive system. The eye comes out the Miko's mouth the morning Rick and Morty are about to leave.

Dipper and Pines arrive here via a portal and various misadventures happen. In one episode, Miko gets kidnapped by the skeleton king so he can insert his pelvis bone into Mabel's anus. In another episode, Nyago caught Dipper pelvic thrusting on top of Miko.

In a special episode, Nyaon, a blue mountain cat, will be a caricature of Jirocho of Shimizu(), a famous yakuza boss, which Niyandar will be a caricature of Katsuzo of Kurokoma(), a rival of Jirocho. In the special, Nyaon will go by the name of Magopachi of Odawara(), which Niyandar will go by the name of Denji of Machida(). In the episode, Jiropachi ends up killing Denji in the turf war.

In another episode, Gumball hacks into Nyago's computer and recorded him masturbating in his nap. After the video got uploaded, Niyandar Kamen asks Kyacchin to find the uploader of the video. Later, Niyandar arrives at Elmore through a portal. When he caught Gumball hacking into Miko's computer and recording her undressing, Niyandar Kamen knocks Gumball unconscious with his hard katana sheath.

In a possible episode, the Berenstein Bears comes to town for vacations. However, during the vacations, Sister Bear goes into labor and have a baby with facial appearances similar to Brother Bear, which is later viewed that Brother Bear inseminated Sister Bear artificially. Brother Bear treats the newborn as an another sister and eventually kills Honey Bear by inserting Niyandar Kamen's katana up Honey Bear's anus.

In a possible movie, the events take place in New Cat City(parody of New York City).

Nyago was in a vacation when a family friend's spouse is suffering from tuberculosis. The doctor told the friend that to heal her fully, he has to do favors. Nyago later saw dead people on the streets and people committing suicide from taking loanshark-rate loans, which he suspects to be the family friend. Knowing that such actions are unforgivable, he transforms into Niyandar and slay the family friend and the doctor and healed the spouse. The immortal berated him for spilling blood.

<TEXT> When I immigrate to the US in 2000, the first summer vacation I have taken was in 2003 when I went back to China. I stayed for a month. Every morning, I was with my grandpa eating cheong fun rolled noodle rolls. That's when I go swimming daily.

In 2005, we went to Canada for a 3-day trip. I met my father's friend's family. While in Toronto, I saw the Toronto light rail passing by. That's when I want to ride the Hudson-Burgen Light Rail in New Jersey.

In 2006, we went to Boston. We stopped at Yale University and the No Name restaurant at the harbor.

In 2007, we went to Washington, DC. We stopped at important places that were the foundation of US, the White House, and the Sedonnah Caves.

In 2011 late Spring before I start the 5-day suspension in High School, I went to the Longwood gardens in Pennsylvania with my mom. We saw beautiful flowers around the gardens. In the summer, I went back to China the second time. Everything has changed. We rode on the high-speed railway, saw plants growing on the highway, and went to Beijing.

I haven't gone to summer vacations much. I don't seem to be interested in going. </TEXT>

The company has been criticized by PETA for animal abuse. I saw videos of abuse behind the scenes. Elephants were beaten with whips. They are seen being chained and kept in compartments with very little moving space. Monkeys are seen tortured during rehearsals.

<TEXT> In the Spring Semester, I applied for five class. I wasn't doing well in Accounting and Microeconomics. The professors weren't that good. I ended up having to drop the classes to save my GPA. If I have went to tutoring and not go to the Japan Club all the time, I would not have dropped.

During the Summer, my father's friends's company closed down and moved to Chicago. I was applying to several jobs. I was able to get a job at Greenpeace, but did not get accepted because I couldn't get three people to sign up.

In August 10, I dislocated my shoulder from diving. It took me 2 weeks to heal. I couldn't swim.

In the Fall semester, I took physics. I never taken physics in high school, so I struggled in the class. However, the professors are laid-back. Ended up getting a D+ in lab and a D in physics. If I went to tutoring, I would have did better.

I regretted of not registering to vote. If I have vote, I could have voted for Jill Stein if I knew Hillary was like Trump. The electoral college voted for Trump. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Now that Trump and GOP clams the White House and the congress, we will likely see states becoming self-sufficient, using tax money for local programs.

The rich states send money to poorer states to help them. Trump and the GOP will gut social and environmental programs, which will hurt the poorer states. The three biggest states are New York, California, and Texas. California and Texas have succession movements. California will have a referendum for succession by the next election.

There will be less taxes going to the federal government. What will likely happen is that with the states becoming self-sufficient, Trump and the GOP will be useless, other than enriching themselves. The poorer states would have to become self-sufficient. They will suffer.

By 2020, if the Democrats or moderate Republicans win the White House, states will share taxes and stop the continental congress policy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The bald eagle is the national animal of America, which is a symbol of courage, strength, and freedom. 2016 turns out to be the one of the worst years in US history. Lately, the bald eagle is unhappy of the future of America.

Two days of the election, two bald eagles are caught fighting in mid-air, eventually falling into the storm drain hole. The male is protecting the female from falling, but gives up and the female ends up falling into the drain. A few days after, the female dies. Many Hillary supporters made this metaphor of the election.

When an another bald eagle named Uncle Sam visits Trump, it attracts Trump. When Trump tries to approach the bald eagle, it attacks back. This is a metaphor that America hates Trump and want him to fail.  </TEXT>

The show, however, barely makes 1 million views per episode. The show was renewed for a second season. GradeAUnderA is a possible rival of Adam Conover, how also criticizes about anything he wants.

Here are some future thing I hope Adam ruins: porn, presidency, governments, such as monarchy, autocracy, socialism, communism, feudalism or democracy, public schools, colleges, wars, railways, air travel, ninjas, samurais, water travel, public transportation, credit cards, TVs, debt, superstitions, news, racism, bulling, banking, cellphone, and corruption. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What Will Likely Happen in the Next 4 Years </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-06 20:34:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Now that Trump becomes president in Jan. 20, here are the likely situations that will likely happen in the next four years.

America will be incompetent and ungovernable. It has become very polarized, where both political parties are at opposite extremes. The Capitol will be full of infighting, disagreements, and no good solutions coming out. Trump is unpredictable. He flip-flops often, causing policies to flip back and off often. The GOP can't get things done. If they do, people will feel unhappy and blame them for the incompetence, where they will scapegoat Democrats and their supporters.

Due to the incompetence, state and local governments will do the congress' job. They will help the people while the congress will be full of infighting. People like Sanders and Ellison are reaching out to people about what the GOP is doing and what they can do to help America. Lately, governor Andrew Cuomo proposed to give free college to the middle and the working class. This will help them climb the social ladder.

Rich people will feel that the congress and the White House will help them, not the poor. After seeing the middle and the working class feeling the effects of incompetence, they will help the state and local governments to help the needy, thus fulfilling Sander's policies of socialism.

With the state and local government helping the locals, 2018 can help Democrats control the congress. With this in mind, Trump and the GOP would be scared that the Democrats will expose them for their incompetence and corruption. Trump will see his approval rating drop and would lose 2020. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before I started college, a school year is usually between early September to late June. During the school year, I would expect short breaks during holidays, with two months of summer break.

The Fall semester is usually between early September to late January. The Spring semester is usually between early February to late June. We have pre-planned curriculum, half-days, and parent-teacher conferences.

During my elementary school years, we have recess and lunch. The classes are much more slow and I often go to after-school. Each day, the classes are different. There are field trips often.

During my intermediate school years, we stopped having recess. The classes are much faster. The field trips are not as much. Each day, we do have different classes each day. In the 8th grade, I have math class that consists of two separate periods, instead of consecutive periods. I got suspended once for sexual harassment.

During my high school year, the classes are much faster. I only have one field trip. In science class, it happen to include lab class. I got suspended once for racism. After this situation, I became more liberal. </TEXT>

We seen many breakdowns on Facebook and Twitter. Eventually, the restaurant closed last year.

Amy herself divorced in 2003 before committing identify theft. She later married Samy before opening the restaurant in 2007.

This fiasco has manifested into the 2016 election. We will see how Trump's presidency will likely parallel Amy's Baking Company.

Trump has divorced several times and caught up in several lawsuits, I.e. Trump University.

His policies are likely to be final and are likely to be inelastic. </TEXT>

I heard about same day registration for election day. I still didn't think about registering for election day. I told my parents to vote for Hillary, while my grandpa didn't went to vote. My aunt supported for Trump, but I know that move is a regrettable choice.

If I have known about Hillary isn't that trustable like Trump, I would have vote for a third party. If I have known about Johnson and Stein, I would make a protest vote to Stein because she is also liberal and the Green Party supported conservation, which is important. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even though Democrats lost 2016, there is some light in this darkness. By March, the Democratic Party is electing the next DNC chairman.

Sanders endorsed Ellison. I started to believe in Sanders after the special forum 2 weeks ago in Kenosha. I started to appreciate Sanders. Elison is a representative from Minnesota. He is Muslim and a progressive.

I appreciate progressives. They are the kind of people who can give everyone liberties. We seen good things that Obama has done in the last 8 years. Now that Trump and the GOP takes control of the government, they are trying to make things worst.

With Ellison as the DNC chairman, they are able to win back 2018. By then, the GOP are the majority and they will rant about the Democrats all the time. Trump will likely to be exposed and the people who voted him will they they were tricked by voting him.

The Young Turks say they Bernie Sanders, Tulsi Gabbard, and Nina Turner as good potential candidates as DNC chairman or chairwoman. They are populists and progressives. However, I checked mainstream media saying that Alan Dershowitz would resign if Keith Ellison runs or he will help republicans. The mainstream media are trying to discredit him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I immigrated to the US, my grandpa and I walk on the streets regularly. Whenever I walk on the streets, we look at the cars on the roads. I became a car person.

As I became older, my grandpa started to decline. We started to walk less. I become less interested in cars. I didn't want to get a driver's license. A few days ago, I get my first non-driver ID.

As I became interested in Japanese culture, that's when I became interested in railways. Railway traveling is very heavy in urban and suburban areas while sparse in rural and regional areas. A few days ago, I realize that JR Hokkaido plans to transfer several sections to 3rd sectors or to close them down and replace with bus systems. Honshu has the highest railway passengers.

I find railways very eco-friendly and efficient. Having cars on the streets pollutes the environment. Railways help connect from one city to another.

As the Shinkansen has expanded into Hokuriku and Hokkaido, sleeper cars are phasing out. Before, sleepers cars were common, now the last blue train Cassiopeia was also phased out. In current terms, to travel from one city to another, people can use airplanes or with the Shinkansen. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Line Closures In Japan </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In 2011, the Towada Railway Company Line closed. In 2014, the Iwaizumi Line of JR East closed due to prohibitively expensive costs of repair and low demand. In 2015, the Kikonai-Esashi section of the Esashi Line of JR Hokkaido closed due to low passenger numbers. Earlier this month, the Rumoi-Mashike section of the JR Hokkaido closed also to low passenger numbers. Several stations on the Sekisho and the Nemuro Lines have closed and some became signal grounds. JR Hokkaido have plans to consolidate its network.

JR East, Central, West, and Kyushu reported profits, while Hokkaido and Shikoku reported losses. The railways in the Honshu island have the best railway lines and the shinkansen. The is the island where most of the big cities are in. Kyushu have the shinkansen that goes to Kagoshima, with a future route to Nagasaki.

In Hokkaido, the biggest city is Sapporo. Other important cities include, but not limited to Asahikawa, Obihiro, and Hakodate. Between Hakodate and Otaru, the Hakodate Line is mostly single-tracked and unelectrified. Currently, there is a shinkansen line that goes to Hakodate.

In Shikoku, the only way to get there is via the Honshi-Bisan Line that runs on the Seto Bridge. The biggest city is Matsuyama. Other important cities include Kochi, Takamatsu, and Tokushima. The Iyo Railway in Matsuyama reports profits, while the Asa Kaigan Railway and the Tosa Electric Railway report losses. The Asa Kaigan Railway line consists of three stops. The Tosa Electric Railway merged with other companies in Kochi and is currently able to report profits from the tram operation but report losses from bus operation.

This situation is similar to the Beeching cuts in the UK. The policy causes a large number of railway lines to close down due to low ridership and competition with motor vehicles.

Will a lower railway coverage, these services will be replaced with regional buses. However, buses cannot replace what trains can offer.

Update: The Sanko Line of JR West will close next year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lately, I am seeing articles about Trump voters having regrets. The regret is that Trump would fix the problems Obama caused. However, there are news articles that the GOP threatens to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and social security. Trump wanted to get rid of Obama are and replace it it with something that works. However, he will give Trumpcare that forces people to get private health care, causing premiums to raise.

Sanders was right. If it was him vs. Trump, he would have won, and America could have diverted from the regretful mistake. The next four years will be full of misery. There aren't enough senators to stop a filibuster, which is a good thing as Democrats will use it to voice the regrets.

I didn't regret not voting. Hillary and Trump were awful candidates. If Sanders was the Democratic nominee, I would have voted. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why I Won't Vote For Hillary in 2020 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-22 16:26:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After Hillary lost 2016, I'm not going to vote for her anymore. She isn't the female president America wanted.

She was corrupt, just like Trump. She had systemic corruption, hubris, and incompetent just like Trump. By the time when people realize that Trump can't keep promises, like Berlusconi when he resigned, people will want him to give up and let Democrats deal with him.

Sanders is better, but Hillary and her team made propaganda that socialism is bad, thus rigging the election. In a recent special forum of Sanders in Kenosha, his message was right that Trump and Clinton weren't that favorable, but he would be better.

If Sanders win 2020, he will make America great and undo the damage that Trump and the GOP inflicted.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Flowerpot Fiasco </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Today at 10:30 am, my flowerpot in the bedroom cracked, leaking water into my laptop. The screen starts to flash. I then shut down the laptop by holding the power button.

I wiped the laptop dry. When my dad came home from grocery shopping, he used a hairdryer to dry the laptop from the outside. The laptop couldn't turn on when it's dry.

I called the Apple Care Center and set up an appointment for repair at the Apple Store. I had to choose Wednesday because I have finals tomorrow and Tuesday. My dad have to work on Tuesday.

Speaking of the flowerpot, it is made of glass. My room is colder than my parent's. Last night, I refilled the flowerpot with lukewarm water. Possibility the water froze last night and thawed this morning, causing the flowerpot to crack.

Update: Found out all of the hardware have to be replaced and costs 755 to fix and takes a week to replace. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why I Don't Have a Driver's License </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am currently 20. I do not have a driver's license. Here are some of my reason I don't have one.

I am not a fan of owning a car. Before I often walk with my grandpa on the streets to go running errands. I look at the cars on the streets. I sometimes sit in my father's lap in the driver's seat. Nowadays, I am a fan of trains. Trains are more efficient and more eco-friendly that cars. If I happen to start my songwriting career in Japan, I would rather use railways that owning a car.

I don't go out much anymore. I used to run errands with my grandpa. Nowadays, I have a computer at home, I don't need to go outside much, except it I have to, i.e. visiting the dentist, visiting the doctor, going to college. For these, I can rely on my father or use public education.

I am not much of a traveler. Before I started high school, we would sometimes go to vacations in the Summers. The trips are usually 2 or 3-day long trips. The last time I went on vacation was in the Summer of 2011 when I returned to my hometown. Ever since then, I don't go to vacations much.

I don't like to drink alcohol. Alcohol is bad for the brain. Last month, I attended my cousin's wedding. By the end of the wedding, my cousin drank shots of tequila and got drunk. It took him 15 minutes to vomit.

Update: I got my non-driver ID fill out. I did 8 years because I don't want to drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> After hearing Sander's MSNBC special forum, it made me love Sanders more than Trump and Clinton. In the special forum, he made several points, i.e. working class paying for health care, election not based on racism but rather job opportunities, Obama was a good president.

During the presidential campaign, I gave my full support for Hillary. I realize that GradeAUnderA can't trust Hillary or Trump but rather Sanders. Both of them are corrupt, unreliable, and horrible. Right now, Trump is draining the swamp into the White House. Having billionaires in the Cabinet will likely to have crony capitalism, which will cause havoc to the ordinary people.

People on the forum say that the election was "too 'personally driven.'" Both Clinton and Trump are based off what they wanted.

Sanders is quite popular for 2020. I want him for president by then. He will likely undo Trump's damages and make America great. However, by then, he would be 79. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why's There's No Walmart in NYC </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-13 22:23:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I live in Queens. The nearest Walmart is in Valley Stream in Nassau County. You may be wondering, "Why isn't there a Walmart in NYC?" I'll tell you why.

Walmart is a hypermarket, a store consists of both a supermarket and a department store. These stores sell groceries and consumer goods. These stores are discounted stores. If there is one in NYC, it will kill off competition.

Walmart is like a monopoly. Any mom-and-pop stores will close down and people will have to depend on Walmart. We have seen the Family Guy episode "Hell Comes to Quahog" and the South Park episode "Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes." In these episodes the big-box stores parody Walmart. It causes a monopoly to occur in the town. The only way to stop them is by destroying it.

Walmart pays its workers minimum wage. It keeps them in poverty, making them dependent on social programs. Crimes in these stores are rampant.

<TITLE> Rules to be a Favorable President </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-13 16:21:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Speaking of the last three presidents America had, Presidents Obama and Clinton were favorable while Presidents Bush was unfavorable. Here are my tips to be a favorable president.

Rule 1: Aggressive behavior, scaremongering and fear mongering doesn't work.
Aggressive behavior makes an impression of being erratic and a madman. Scaremongering and fear mongering will cause opponents get attacked.

Rule 2: Have a strong slogan.
Obama made a strong slogan of hope and change with the slogan "Yes we can." Trump's slogan was "Make America great again."

Rule 3: Corruption is bad.
Both Hillary and Trump aren't good candidates for 2016, but people have no choice other than Sanders. Hillary accepted bribes from people who supported her and gave them special interests. Trump will likely take money that is supposed to help the poor and give them to his cronies.

Rule 4: The Cabinet must be filled with people of merit, not wealth.
With people of merit, everyone will prosper. With people of wealth, only the selected will prosper.

Rule 5: Criticisms are good, but don't make it too obvious.
Everyone makes criticisms about anything. Presidents are allowed to do so but shouldn't make it obvious. They should keep it to themselves if prevent butthurt. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After The Simpsons predicted a Trump victory before a Clinton presidency in 2000 and reading news articles about Clinton vs. Trump 2.0 in 2020, it's likely possible.

In the episode, we see Homer inside Trump's head and see what the future looks like, i.e. deplorable. Currently, Trump drained the swamp into the White House, causing inequality to rise. I am seeing that 2018 might not favor senate Democrats.

In 2020, there will be the Olympics in Tokyo, and Japan is opening itself to the outside world, while in 2016, the Rio Olympics was deplorable, i.e. Lochtegate, poor construction work, zika, and polluted waters. We will see 2020 better than 2016, where Japan is a peaceful and beautiful country. By the time the 2020 Olympics starts, the affected railways in Tohoku will be reopened.

By the time 2020 approaches, Trump plans will likely backfire and people are protesting to voice their anger against Trump. Hillary and the Democrats will have already learned their mistakes in 2016 and people want Democrats back. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why The Next Four Years Will Be Full of BS, Butthurt, Betryal, and Surprises </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-07 21:30:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Now that Trump won 2016, there are legitimate reasons the next four years will be full of BS, Butthurt, Betryal, and Surprises.

Trump want to repeal Obamacare. Obamacare itself doesn't work well. Republicans want to appeal it without an alternative. This will cause the poorer Trump supporters to feel butthurt that there might not be an affordable and effective health care program.

House speaker Ryan Paul wants to repeal Medicare. Medicare is important and popular as it gives the elderly health insurance that they would otherwise couldn't afford. Replacing it with the voucher systems doesn't work as seniors would have to pay for some of the costs.

Eliminating the Common Core and implanting the voucher system doesn't work. The common core is useful in public schools. Not all students will get the high-quality education they want. Charter schools don't always accept every student who want to go there.

Banning immigration and building the wall doesn't work. Banning immigration will cause terrorism to rise. Building the wall is expensive and will take time for it to be completed. Bridges are better than walls but would require high-level security.

Since there aren't enough republicans to prevent a filibuster, some of Trump's policies might not go through. Democrats can be able to stop some of Trump's policies.

Update: Trump just elected an opponent of the EPA. Farmers be very! </TEXT>

The food here are cheap compared to other yakiniku restaurants in New York. I have 9 items to choose for lunch special. I get discounts for al la carte items during happy hour.

Since last year, I met a host who transferred to Baruch from BMCC. He knew me because I used my student email to make reservations. I usually have two appetizers, two al la carte items, and the 3-item lunch special. 

I like coming here because the prices are affordable and the choices are wide. If you come alone, it's better to come for lunch as they have lunch special.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Between 2010 and 2014, I attended a zoned high school that was a mile from my home. During my time there, I found out the mascot from the school is an owl. I didn't mind about the mascot but I made friends from the school.

Currently, I am a sophomore at Baruch college. Thinking about the owl mascot, more than a year ago, I started to subscribe to VanossGaming after looking up gaming videos. Vanoss started his gaming career in 2011, and since 2014 he started using the signature owl mask. Last year, he replaces his logo with an owl logo; a few months ago, he swapped his owl mask with another one with more feathers and his Converse-like shoes with Nike-like shoes with his owl logo.

I realized that this has to be a coincidence. </TEXT>

After waking up from the dream, I thought to myself, "This might happen." Recently, chef Gordon Ramsay hosts a show called "Hotel Hell" where he visits failing hotel. One of the hotels he visits is Cambridge Hotel in Cambridge, New York. The hotel was owned by ex-serviceman and lawyer John Imhof between 2007 and 2012. After the hotel closed, it was transformed into a senior living facility. I realized that the dream became true. </TEXT>

Robot Chicken is an animated show aired on Adult Swim. This show contains skits of characters from pop culture. If Robot Chicken features the Berenstein bears, this is what I wanted to expect. But before telling you it, there might be some vulgarity.

In this skit, Brother and Sister Bear are in school. The Sister Bear suddenly is in labor. She later gave birth to a baby boy who looks like gramps. It turns out Brother Bear made a bet with gramps to impregnate Sister Bear. Brother Bear loves the new baby more than Honey Bear, who late becomes jealous. He then kills Honey Bear to show his full love to the new baby. </TEXT>

<TITLE> If I Was a President </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-27 01:39:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here are my policies if I was a president (Caution: May cause butthurt)

Immigration:
It's not that immigration should be closed for people from certain countries. We need better regulations and better border control. We need more border police officers to control illegal immigration. Building a wall will hurt relations, but rather build a bridge with strong security.

Taxes:
The rich should pay more taxes. We need higher taxes to fund programs to fund the needy and to reduce the debt. Lower classes should pay 5%, middle classes should pay 15%, and upper classes should pay 35%.

Education:
If a student wants a good education, schools should provide after school programs and extracurricular programs. The student should be encouraged to do a minimum number of hours of community service before graduation. Public schools should do more to give a good education.

College tuition is free if a student's performance is above the minimun required GPA. Tuition should be $50 for a 3 or 4-credit class in community colleges, $100 for every class in senior colleges, and $150 for every graduate studies and above. Stipends a avilable for studnets to get textbooks and for personal uses. Schools are allowed to give students interns that if they complete them, they can have the full tuition paid in full and have some stipend for personal use.

All students of public school should recite the pledge of allegiance. It's part of the cultural identity.

Sex education should be part of the education curriculum. This class is important if they ever have sex.

Abortion:
Abortions should be legal. If a state doesn't want to legalize abortion, the federal government shouldn't force them to. All abortion clinics are allowed to use weapons, i.e. bayonets, daggers, swords, spears, to give abortions. If a minor is pregnant due to incestual rape, she is allowed to have an abortion if her parents wants it.

Guns:
There should be stronger checks for gun ownership. Gun cause more violence than not having guns.

Health Care:
We need taxpayers to fund the health care system. Middle-class cannot get free insurance and cannot pay for themselves. There should be a universal healthcare system, or Unicare.

Medicare is important. Seniors cannot afford to purchase insurance for themselves.

Internet/FCC:
The internet should be open. We need some form of surveillance. This form of surveillance should only look for suspicious activities.

TV shows are allowed to be mature-themed. If a kid show wants to have vulgarity, i.e. South Park, it should be noted in the rating system. Independent TV shows can be released on Netflix, YouTube, or Hulu, but should have lax regulations that on TV networks.

Showing nudity is highly forbidden. If one wants to show nudity online, it must be self-censored. Using profanity doesn't have to be always censored; kid shows are allowed to have vulgar language, but should be noted in the rating system.

Trade:
Free trade doesn't always work. We need some tariffs for trade. It should be capped at 10%.

Welfare:
Eliminating welfare programs don't work. If a person gets laid off, he can get unemployment benefits. If a person gets a new job, he doesn't have to receive unemployment benefits. If he received all of this unemployment benefits, he can attend employment seminars and should be able to be employed again.

Banking:
Banks should give people insurance in case the bank fails. The money from the bank accounts can be transferred to a new bank of the owner's choice.

Voting Right:
Everyone should have a right to vote. When a person is eligible to vote, he or she should be registered automatically. He or she shouldn't be harassed for voting.

Civil Rights:
Everyone have the same rights. It is okay to speak up if a person's rights were violated.

Environment:
We need to invest in renewable energy. If we use unrenewable energy, the Earth will likely be unsustainable.

Supreme court:
The supreme court judges should support both sides of the political spectrum. This way, both sides are considered.

Porn: 
Porn shall be legal with the exception of unanimated child porn. It helps with the economy. Sexually suggestive content is not pornographic but is considered obscene.

Prostitution: 
Prostitution should be legal. It prevents illegal prostitution and is good for the economy.

Drug Use: 
All drug paraphernalia are illegal with the exception of medical marijuana and up to 10oz of some controlled substance. Studies show that medical marijuana does wonders.

Gambling: 
Gambling should be legal and regulated. It is beneficial to the economy. However, if a person loses all of their money, they should be kicked out right away.

Death Penalty: 
Death penalty should be abolished as it is not a deterrent to crimes. Live imprisonment with or without parole is much more cost-effective.

Nuclear Weapons: 
We need to negotiate other countries. With nuclear weapons, humanity will disappear.

NATO: 
The NATO is important if Europeans countries are attacked by enemy states. The US should use drones to attack enemy strong points.

Terrorism/ISIS: 
We need better intelligence operations. We need to use drones to attack strongpoints.

Murder: 
All murders are punishable to life imprisonment with the exceptions of murdering one's children, especially mentally impaired ones, relatives, anyone who insulted you, and testing a new sword on a person within 1 hour of acquiring it. Such murders need an eyewitness to be justifiable.

Sex crimes: 
All rape are punishable by up to 15 years of imprisonment with the exception of the use of condoms for fornication of corpses, animals, and relatives, and executed people without a condom within one hour of being executed.

Glass-Steagall: 
This policy is important. We need regulations that will prevent another recession or lessen the impact of a recession.

Population Control: 
If the population growth continues with our current trends, the Earth will be unstable. In order to control the population, people should have less offspring or kill others indiscriminately.

Waterboarding: 
Waterboarding is ineffective as it causes harm and is considered torture. To interrogate effectively, we need lie-detection technology and manipulation.

Religion/Freedom of speech: 
Everyone has a right to believe in their own religion. People are allowed to join another religion if they want.

People are allowed to use online forums to have discussions of various sources. 

Email use/Social media use: 
I will use an encrypted secondary email account if the FBI allows and/or use Facebook and Twitter to let people voice their concerns. These emails will be responded by my cabinet members to see what laws and regulations need to be changed or implanted.

Video games: 
To allow violent video games, we need a video game rating systems, not to ban them. This rule applies to tv shows and movies.

Corruption:
Corruption is a crime as people take other people's money for their greed. Anyone committing it shall be imprisoned for 5-10 years and have their property confiscated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the Senior year of High School, I skipped the trip and prom. They weren't that important to me.

The trip was from January 31, 2014, to February 2, 2014. I chose to skip the trip because the trip started on the same time of the first day of the Chinese New Year, so I chose to stay with my family. In addition, I found out the trip was at a ski lodge in Upstate New York and costs $300. I have never skied before, so I chose to skip it.

The prom was in May 2014. Since I went to the one during my intermediate school year and started regretting going, I didn't want to go. The day before the prom, several of my Law of Government/Economy class students wanted me to go, but I told them I wasn't going as I didn't pay for the prom. Found out the teacher of the class also skipped the prom. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Skipping the 6th Grade Camping Trip Offer </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> During the 6th grade, my social studies teacher invited me to a camping trip because I was an outstanding student in the class. I have never gone to any camping trip, so I rejected the offer.

Later that day, a classmate of mine, who was also a close neighbor, gave my dad the form to go to the camping trip. Realising he has the form, we filled it out, knowing that he would expect me to go.

After the weekend, I brought the form with me as I was expected to give it to the social studies teacher. The first-period class I had on the day was P.E. Before the class starts, I wet the form in the water fountain and then ripped it up. Later that day, I told other students and teachers that I didn't want to go on the camping trip and am have other things to do. The classmate heard me.

One day, when coming home from the after-school program, the classmate followed me and told my grandpa that I ripped up the form and not going to the trip. I lied to my grandpa that I was going.

On another day, when my dad picked me, my grandpa and the classmate from the after-school program in Woodside, the classmate told my dad that I ripped up the form and am not going. My father tried to punish me but the classmate said that there is school.

The next day, the social studies student gave the classmates who are going to the camping trip a list of what to bring to the trip. Knowing that I was not going to the trip, I kept quiet.

<TITLE> Skipping the PSAT </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In the Sophomore year of High School, I was given a ticket in October 2011 telling me to go to the designated room to take the PSAT. However, I wasn't that interested in taking the practice test, so I said I want to wait for next year. I told other teachers that I want to take it next year.

In the Junior year, I received a ticket In October 2012. When I saw the card, I ripped it up right away because I was uninterested in taking the practice test.

On the days that I scheduled to take the test, I originally had to arrive by 7:30 am. However, since I chose to skip the tests, I came at 10:30 am. When I entered the school, I saw the answer sheets of the people who took the test.

My father asked me about my PSAT score, so I lied to him that it was 110. By the senior year, I told him that I didn't take it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> No Turkey This Thanksgiving </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This Thanksgiving, we didn't have turkey. There are several reasons why we didn't have turkey.

The first reason is that my dad had to work. Originally, we wanted to cook some lobster noodles, but since he has to work, we didn't cook.

The second reason is that my aunt is in China for vacation. The turkey is large. In previous Thanksgivings, we cut off the skin and put them in Peking duck buns. However, since my cousins aren't coming, we decided not to purchase one.

The third reason why there's no turkey is that we think that turkey isn't that delicious. We prefer roast pork and chicken, which is much tastier. I myself isn't much of a fan to turkey, but a fan of pork. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why a Trump Presidency Will Only Benefit the Rich </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-24 05:15:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After hearing policies of privatizing health care, implanting a school choice system, lowering taxes to the rich, increasing infrastructure, and tax breaks to business owners, I suspect Trump is widening the gap of income inequality.

Privatizing the health care system only works for the rich. Poor people will likely lose health insurance as they are unable to afford it. They can have low-cost insurance plans from other states but have poor coverage. Middle-class families who can't afford to have health insurance should have a plan where they can pay what they can afford and get want they need.

A school choice system gives the rich better college choices. Public schools will likely to be underfunded. Charters schools can reject students from poorer communities. Only rich people would support such a system. This system will lead to school segregation. Common core is important for public schools, as they give an incentive to students from public schools.

Lowering taxes for the rich will very likely widen the gap of the income equality. Such a situation will increase the public debt dramatically, leading to the eventual US bankruptcy.

Increasing infrastructure does not increase jobs. The construction company will likely get richer and leads to alarming rates of gentrification.

Tax breaks to the business owners will make them rich. The money is likely not to be used to create jobs but will lead to greed. </TEXT>

When I started class at 10:45am. The class was to 40% attendance rate. We went through the usual class lecture.

In Japanese class, it's a full class. We also went through what we have to learn.

In physics lecture and lab, it's the same full class. We did what we have to do.

When I entered the train station at 8:20pm, the station was barely crowded. The train was also barely crowded. When I arrived at the Grand Central station to transfer for the 7 train, the train was somewhat full. When I arrived at Roosevelt Ave station to take the bus home, I saw several crowded Q70's. The Q47 that I took was barely full. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lately, Trump announced that he "will not prosecute Hillary" and "disavow and condemn" the alt-right. This has caused his supporters, Breitbart, and the alt-right feeling butthurt.

To understand why he doesn't want to prosecute Hillary, read the post "The Real Reason Trump Won't Prosecute Hillary." During the RNC convention and the nomination speeches, he announced that he will "lock Hillary up." He flip-flopped the prosecution due to the hardships Hillary faced in the race.

Recently, we see a video of a neo-Nazi group making a Hitler salute. On Monday, his team made a statement of disavowment and today, he made such a statement with his own words. I see that his rhetoric sparked a rise in alt-right but with this statement, many will split away from him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the past three Mondays, I started to go to this Japanese buffet restaurant called Ichiumi at 32st in Koreatown.

The first time I went to Ichiumi was in mid-September, the restaurant only had cooked food. The place is large and have lots of food to choose from. It was $18.95, which I though was cheap as they have more than 50 items to choose from compared to only 10 item for $9.99 around Baruch.

On the first Monday of this month, I went there for lunch. Shabu-shabu is included in the lunch buffet. While I was getting food, my uncle approached me. My aunt, my uncle and aunt-in-law also came. They asked me if I come here every day, to which I said no.

The shabu-shabu includes seafood, noodles, vegetables, pork, and beef. It was fun to have this type of winter dish as part of the buffet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the past year, I have been visiting websites from psychics. I believe that psychics can be accurate of what the future have in store.

Since Trump announced his run last year, I relied on psychics to see if he can win. Many of their fingers were pointing to Hillary.

One of the most reliable psychics was by the name of Jeanne Mayell. I like her website as she explained her predictions and her monthly readings. 

Recently, I am seeing a new update where we see what republicans are doing in 2017, i.e. scandal with Russia; a scene still grey snow, looking out the window, a phone call, talk with Russia at the White house; the White House talking, making deals with Russia in Feb. 2017, a donkey walking away lonely and defeated (democratic party) in Mar. 2017, Republicans trying to amend the Constitution, take away rights in Apr. 2017, hard times, fear, depression in May 2017, an important international, probably U.N. council takes place in Jun. 2017, vacations are down  people are too poor in Jul. 2017, tax issues  Trump making tax policy to lower taxes on the ultra rich, formalized in Aug. 2017, kids going back to school with the weight of the world on their shoulders in Sep. 2017, the prison system expanding and the latino illegal immigrants being pursued in Oct. 2017, new tax law created, not passed in Nov. 2017, and Capitol building glowing red hot with conflict, rage, asserting itself in Dec. 2017.

<TEXT> Yesterday, I left college at 6:20pm and went to the train station to get home. While I was in there, I waited for 10+ minutes for a 6 train.

The first train skipped the station. When the next train arrived, I was so crowded that I had to take a seat to avoid the crowding. When I went to the 42nd St-Grand Central station, it took a while to get off the train.

Speaking of such situation, last Monday, I took the M train to Lexington Ave-52nd St station and transferred to the 6 train. The next train dispatcher said that the next train will arrive in 10 minutes. When the train arrived, it was crowded.

Sometimes, the 6 trains skip all the way to 14th St-Union Square. </TEXT>

On the day of the reopening, Billy walked out of the restaurant before coming back to finish the day.

In the revisit, we see that the restaurant is doing well. Shortly after the restaurant closed and became Skybox Restaurant and Sports Bar, which closed in 2011, before becoming Benchwarmers Tavern and Grill.

<TEXT> Since I immigrated to the US in 2000, my family have been supporting the Democrat Party. I myself consider myself center-left to left wing.

When I came, President Bush was in office. I felt that he is not as radical as Trump. He did a shit job during his tenure.

From 2008, I became more interested in politics as America is having the first black president. In the 7th grade in intermediate school that I attended that was a few blocks from where I live, we were given a mock ballot. I myself voted for Obama. When the results were announced, the vice-principal announced that 95% voted for Obama, while 5% voted for McCain.

In school, we watched Obama's inauguration. I felt that the inauguration shows that the government is on the right track.

My parents voted for Sanders in the primary elections. I myself supported for Hillary.

Now that Trump will become the next president, I have been signing petition after petition to overturn Trump's policies. Tomorrow, I will call Senator Schumer directly to voice my concerns directly.

I hope the senate Democrats and senate Republicans can work to oppose Trump. I will always vote for Democrats no matter what is going on.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Dislocated Shoulder </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I started swimming at 11:30am on Aug 10. When I started diving, I felt a twisting sensation and then pain in my right arm.

My dad and a guard pulled me up. I was laying on my belly for 20 minutes. My dad wanted to call an ambulance but I was reluctant to let him. When I was walking to the bench, I was screaming in agony from the pain. At 12:25pm, I got transferred to the ambulance by the medical team via a wheelchair. Getting on the ambulance was a hard thing az I felt the pain from my arm.
 
The ride was rocky. The arm hurts when the ambulance goes through an uneven section. We eventually arrived at the Presbyterian Hospital at 1pm.

While I was there, I got transferred to a hospital bed in the ER. I was given a shot of saline solution and then a shot of morphine. The morphine didn't make me drowsy and didn't cut the pain. 
 
At 3pm, I got transferred to the X-ray room. They took two scans. Later a doctor determined that it was a dislocated shoulder. Four doctors and nurses moved me to the right place so that another nurse can move the shoulder to the right place.

After relocating the shoulder, I got transferred to the X-ray room the second time. They took three scans before sending me back.

I received an evaluation. The nurse who fixed my shoulder told me that she prescribed me some painkillers. She also asked me if I have a job or school. I told her that I start classes by the end of the month. I was also instructed to call a number to schedule a follow-up. She gave me a cloth slung to replace the paper slung. When I change my clothes, I heard a popping noise from my shoulders, meaning that the shoulder fell back into place.

Ever since the shoulder injury, I started to drink notoginseng broth, which help with blood circulation. The first few days since the injury, lifting my arm hurts. One week since the injury, I can lift my arm halfway. Towards the weekend, the arm didn't hurt much when raising it, but the muscles close to the shoulder was stiff. Now, I can fully raise my arm. </TEXT>

<TEXT> After seeing Hillary losing 2016, I have been wondering to myself, "Will America ever have a female president?" The answer is yes and no.

In the post "Why Hillary Lost," I have listed the reasons why she lost. It's not that America doesn't want a female president, but rather based on  policies and the past. In this case, Hillary doesn't have good policies and she is corrupt, i.e. Clinton kill count, where people who worked for Clinton die untimely attempting to expose the Clintons, collecting money for speeches, and bribes that go to the Clinton Foundation.

In another post "Who are the Likely 2020 Election Candidates," Elizabeth Warren is on the list. She is better than Hillary and currently in the senate to work with Sanders and Schumer likely to work with Trump. 

In the world, there are female leaders, i.e. Merkel, Indira, and Park. America is behind by not following this trend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are several reasons why Hillary lost.

One reason is the Emailgate. James Comey had affected Hillary significantly. The end was too late.

Another reason is her lies. She lies during her campaigns. Trump, however, speaks the truth, which nobody wants.

The third reason is the social dystopia. The Democratic Party caused all this recent dystopia, I.e. Black Lives Matter, Syrian War, ISIS, and South China Sea conflicts. During Benghazi, Hillary causes the deaths of four soldiers and the ambassador. The ambassador made several calls to her, which she ignores, to the point that he dies. 

The fourth reason is that she is not a strong political candidate. She dropped in 2008. She failed the bar exam. She was rejected from NASA.

The fifth reason is that she is corrupt. She received payments for making speeches. Various corporations have funded the Clinton Foundation. I made some small donations to her campaign. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We left home at 6:30pm. When we were 600-700 from the restaurant, the traffic was so heavy that it went at a crawling speed. This is the result of heavy development in Flushing. My grandma's phone is ringing constantly.

When we went inside, we were told to sit at our designated tables. Then the wedding was about to start, I found out that the ratio of Asians to non-Asians was 7 to 1, with only one black guest. These people are the bride and groom's college classmates, coworkers, friends, and in-laws. During the wedding, I thought that if Hillary was here, she would think that this is unity and say, "Our society should be like this," while Trump would feel butthurt and would throw some racist rant.

Before the beginning of the wedding, we were served dim sum appetizers. They have char siu pastry, spring roll, hargow, and shumai. There was also alcohol.

The wedding consists of a 9-course meal, wedding games, dances, and an introduction video. The meal is similar to what we had this afternoon. By the sixth course, everyone started to feel full. 

By 10pm, everyone started to leave. By 10:30pm, it's only us and my cousin's college students and coworkers. My cousin is seen taking a high number of tequila shots. 15 minutes late, he became drunk. It took 30 minutes to wake him up. By 11:30pm, we all left.

When we were on the way home, it was fast until we got to 101th St due to road construction and a biker gang parking on the street. </TEXT>

The aunt-in-law was making vegetables for the feast. My dad and I was given a receipt for some food we have to pick up. We then went to the restaurant in Elmhurst, NY to pick up the food. After picking up the food, we went to the nearby supermarket and bought some tangerines. When I peeked inside the supermarket, I can tell that it is in renovation status.

When we went back to the home, we started to prepare the feast and waited for the bride and groom to enter. When they entered, they went to the room, as part of the Chinese traditions. My relatives were given cups of tea to drink before eating. The staples were the usual. There were some seafood yi mein noodles, chow main, and vegetable noodles.

After eating, we cleared the tables. Then, the cameraman take pictures of my cousins' relatives and friends. When they are about to go to the park, my cousin went with them. Currently, I am at home. At 6pm, we will head to the ballroom.

Part II tonight. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Possible 2020 Olympics Boycotts </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-04 02:56:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Now that the 2016 Olympics has ended, I will be talking about the possible 2020 Olympics boycotts.

Tokyo had hosted the Olympics in 1964. This event became a turning point for Japan since the events of WWII.

There are three reasons some would consider boycotting the Olympics: anti-Japanese sentiments, radiation from the Fukushima fallout, and whaling.

Japan became modernized after the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1868. In 1896, there was the first Sino-Japanese War. In 1910, Japan colonized Korea. In 1934, there was the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Rape of Nanjing. After the wars and atrocities, Japan did not owe up to the crimes.

The China-Japan relations are volatile to this day. The volatility increased from the Senkaku Disputes. Some view nationalism on the rise.

On March 11, 2011, the Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami happened. This has led to the Fukushima nuclear plant fallout. A radius of 50 kilometers is still affected.

Several railway lines in Tohoku got affected. The Iwaizumi Line became defunct due to the high costs to repair it and low demand for the line. Parts of the Ofunato and Kesennuma lines got converted to BRT lines. The Joban Line is partly closed and will be fully opened before 2020. The southern part of the Yamada Line will get transferred to the Sanriku Railway Rias South Line upon reopening. 

Japan is notorious for whaling. It is often documented or reported in political news magazines. Currently, there is a petition to boycott the Olympics until whaling becomes history.

However, some think that the Olympics is a chance for reconciliation. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Felling Butthurt </TITLE>

<TEXT> An hour ago, my aunt came over for dinner. We had a conversation about the 2016 elections. After hearing what she said, I felt butthurt.

She said that Hillary is much more dangerous than previously through. She even said that if she becomes president, America would be worst than before. It's because she was a lesbian.

Trump, on the other hand, would make the US better. He would make the economy and the political system better. I myself would not support him due to his insults at minorities and the disabled.

During the dinner, I told her that Hillary is a liberal-leaning-right candidate while Trump is a conservative-leaning-left candidate. She said that doesn't care, only the person who can be a good leader can be the president.

I have been supporting Hillary since the election campaign, and will never become a political traitor. Ever since the emailgate 2.0, I started making donations to the Hillary Fund and to the liberal non-for-profit organizations.

Now that it's just a few days before Election Day, I see that conservatives will revolt if Hillary wins. A few weeks ago, I saw a conspiracy theory video about a possible civil war. From the video, I heard that younger generations support the left while the older generations support the right. Not only political divisions exist regionally, but rather generationally. Even the military has made theories  on how the war would happen.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Land of Ooo is Parallel to Mr. Peabody and Sherman's New York City </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After seeing fanarts of Mr. Peabody and Sherman cosplaying Finn and Jake in the Land of Ooo, I speculate that these two universes are parallel to each other.

Finn and Sherman were orphans and were adopted by Jake and Mr. Peabody respectively. As we see from these two settings, they travel from place to place. They become inseparable.

Sherman and Penny where initial rivals, but later became friends, similar to Finn and Princess Bubblegum. Finn and Sherman have archrivals, i.e. Ice King and Ms. Grunion respectively.

Jake is a shape-changing dog, who can manipulate his body structure to suit any situation, while Mr. Peabody is a highly intelligent. They have living relatives.

Finn uses various swords throughout his adventures while Sherman uses different articles of clothing through their adventures. Finn wears a munsell blue t-shirt, denim shorts, a two-colored lime green circular backpack, rolled-down white socks, a pair of black shoes, and a hat that resembles a bear, while Sherman wears a white t-shirt, black shorts, white shoes that resembles Converse high-tops, white socks, and round glasses. </TEXT>

<TITLE> 8 Years Since the Closing of Black Pearl </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-24 23:26:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Black Pearl was a seafood shack in Alphabet City before moving to Nomad. The restaurant was a few blocks from Baruch College that was owned by David, Brian and Greg.

During the episode, we see that David's ego gets in the way of a good atmosphere. Through the episode, we see how his ego cause the restaurant to fail.

4 days after the episode aired, the restaurant closed due to their sales getting halved. David made a rant about Gordon. One thing that surprised me in the rant was that he wrote "While I hope Gordo meets an untimely death so that I can dance on his grave, it is time to move on."

After the restaurant closed, he went back to his previous career in the music industry, releasing the record "The Quickening" in 2010.

Currently, Hog Pit USA replaced Black Pearl. </TEXT>

<TITLE> One Year Since the Closing of Amy's Baking Company </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-24 23:15:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A year ago, Amy's Baking Company's closed due to the conflicts between the owners and the new landlords of the mall, who built new plumbing, causing the kitchen to have problems. A month later, the new owners opened a new restaurant called B R Wine-Food.

After the restaurant closed, Amy's Baking Company became a wholesale franchise, selling cakes to other companies, and an online school. Since the restaurant has closed, the nightmare has also ended.

Currently, the online storm has died down. We don't see much attacks between Amy's Baking Company and Yelp and Reddit. When I search B R Wine-Food on Yelp, one Yelper said that "The ghost of Amy's Baking Company has finally been exorcised..." Another Yelper said "They don't even have Amy's deserts anymore.  But she didn't make them any way." A third Yelper said "You need to give them a try.  They are fighting the bad wrap from Amy's Bakery..."

Update: Since posting this information, turns out Amy and Samy are living in Westwood, CA in a "posh, five-unit condominium building that features primarily 2-bedroom, 2.75-bath homes for rent, ranging from about 2,100 to 2,300 square feet", while owning a home in Arizona, according to azcentral. She is still baking, updating her Instagram account from time to time and still selling T-shirts from the episode.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Zootopia Coexists With Soul Society </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After seeing fanarts of Nick and Judy cosplaying Ichiruki and vice versa and people saying how their stories are related, I speculate that they coexist with each other.

Ichigo and Nick were shunned by others, while Rukia and Judy are viewed as amateurs. They meet each other while confronting a wanted creature, where they then work with each other until the peers find out.

They then cover more clues and evidence, eventually confronting the perpetrator. Nick and Ichigo became accepted by their established institutions.

Comparing Zootopia with Soul Society. The districts of Zootopia are similar to the districts of Rukongai, which each district are distinct from each other. The Soul Society is similar to the government of the Zootopia, where each company is similar to the departments of Zootopia or any big city, i.e. Tokyo or New York. Genryusai is similar to the mayor. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Gravity Falls: A Metaphor of the 2016 Presidential Election </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-22 05:17:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I speculate that the show Gravity Falls is a metaphor of the 2016 election.

From what I know, Li'l Gideon represents Trump, where he had white hair and seen in a suit. He is a fraud, a metaphor of Trump who uses lies to manipulate people, especially whites to support him.

The Pines represents the Democratic party. Mabel herself represents Clinton. At the beginning of the series, we see Mabel and Li'l Gideon dating, eventually breaking up. The dating part is a metaphor of Trump saying that Clinton is good and inviting her to his 2005 wedding. The break-up is a metaphor to Trump and Clinton announcing their presidential run.

Dipper represents Tim Kaine, Grunkle Pines represents Sanders, and Ford Pines represents Former Mayor Mike Bloomberg. Bill Cipher himself represents Mike Paine early in the series and later Wikileaks founder Jullian Assange.

Assange is attacking both Trump and Hillary. Wikileaks represents the Weirdmaggedon. With the Pines defeating Bill, everything becomes routine, which is a metaphor that Wikileaks will stop bothering them anymore. Bill trapping Mabel is a metaphor of the email dump. When Dipper and Mabel pat each other's back, everything gets destroyed, a metaphor that Clinton and Sanders are working together to get rid of the indictment or keep the party united. Dippy Fresh represents the FBI. In the court, we see his true form, which is a metaphor for the FBI going against Hillary.

The Weirdmageddon represents the time from the conventions to the election day. The first and second part describe the meetings and the third part describes election day. In episode 20, Li'l Gideon faces defeat and inceration, which is a metaphor that Trump is already losing and is bolstering his ego as trying to win.

Mabel, however, has friends who support him. Her friends are women, a metaphor that women like Hillary. One of her friends is Korean, a metaphor that minorities, especially Asians, blacks, and Muslims support Hillary. Soos and Wendy working for the Pines is a metaphor that Hispanics (important) and young adults, importantly women, also support Hillary.

In the last episode of the show, Li'l Gideon has to help the Pines and become reformed, a metaphor that the Republican party will lose and Trump becomes what he was before the presidential run.

Preston Northwest in the last few episodes pledges allegiance to Bill Cipher, who would make lots of money if Bill becomes ruler, a metaphor of a British Scientologist making $100,000 if Trump wins.

Update: The Oct 21 DDos is part of the Weirdmageddon metaphor. I might be wrong about Grunkle Stan, he represents Bill Clinton. Bill and Hillary not receiving donations is a metaphor of Grunkle retiring. Ford represents Bernie Sanders. Bill Cipher becoming a statue is a symbol that Trump will haunt Hillary. Dippy Fresh's true from has been reviewed in real life.

Update: Dippy Fresh's true form has been revealed in real life.

Update: Emailgate 2.0 got dropped. Bill Cipher is destroyed. </TEXT>
