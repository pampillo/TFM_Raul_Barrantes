<TEXT> At a press briefing, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Jared Kushner has no involvement in the project. An attorney for Jared Kushner said he had sold his stake to a trust benefiting other members of the Kushner family, and would recuse himself from related policy matters while serving as an adviser to Trump.

Though the foreign investor immigration program has become a source for cheap real estate financing for projects like the Kushner family's, questions about its fairness and national security implications have made it a political briar patch for years.

<TEXT> Five things to watch at the Sally Yates hearing.

It's not just Sally Yates testifying
Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper is also set to testify. Look for questions about why his earlier assessment of Russian interference in the election contradicted the well-established version now, which is that not only was Russian interference omnipresent, but it was also designed specifically to help Trump.
Republican lawmakers have periodically brought this up over the last few months. Now will be their chance to hear directly from Clapper about whether his previous belief still stands. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Five things to watch at the Sally Yates hearing.

Will there be anything left for House investigators?
The House intelligence committee was supposed to get the first crack at Yates in public, on March 28. But that hearing got swept up in the fiasco surrounding Nunes' clandestine White House trip and later led to him stepping aside from leading his panel's investigation.
It took a month for House investigators to even settle on inviting Yates back for a new hearing, but by that point Graham had already booked her for his investigation with the Senate Judiciary subcommittee. As of last Friday, House investigators still had not settled on a date for her new hearing or if there will be one at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Five things to watch at the Sally Yates hearing.

Did Yates' warning make it all the way to Trump?
We know now that Yates alerted White House counsel Don McGahn to Flynn's phone calls with Kislyak. Flynn's misleading comments, Yates said, made him potentially vulnerable to being compromised by Russia, according to sources familiar with her version of events. She expressed "serious concerns" to McGahn, making it clear -- without making a recommendation -- that Flynn could be fired.
What happened next isn't clear. After that meeting, the White House took three weeks to fire Flynn, which happened in February. But did McGahn ever tell Trump about Yates' warning? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Five things to watch at the Sally Yates hearing.

2. How limited will Yates be?
Democrats have pinned a lot of hopes on Yates, privately promising blockbuster testimony from the former Obama administration official. But a key question is how much she will be limited in public, either through questions regarding classified material, promises of attorney-client privilege or claims of executive privilege from either Trump or former President Barack Obama.
Yates' first public hearing was scheduled for six weeks ago, but it was canceled at the last minute by Trump ally and House intelligence committee Chairman Devin Nunes. Reports later emerged that the White House blocked her testimony, which press secretary Spicer vehemently denied.
Monday's hearing comes a week after FBI Director James Comey spoke to the full Judiciary Committee as well as House investigators. Comey, too, was limited in what he could say, citing an active investigation. As senators tried to pry any bit of information out of him, Comey beat back questions about the continuing federal probe into Russian interference in the US elections, and he likewise revealed few new details to the House intelligence committee. </TEXT>

1. What was the extent of Yates' warning?
Yates told White House staff and other top officials that Flynn could be a security risk after he discussed Russia sanctions with Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak, CNN reported last week. That testimony is expected to contradict the White House's description of her warning, framed by press secretary Sean Spicer as "a 'heads-up' to us on some comments that may have seemed in conflict with what he (Flynn) had sent the vice president."
Trump on Twitter Monday blamed the Obama administration for giving Flynn, who briefly led the Defense Intelligence Agency during the 44th president's tenure, "the highest security clearance." </TEXT>

Speaking in television interviews on Sunday she sought to portray her party as the stable option capable of delivering a good Brexit deal, but noted that EU leaders' attitudes showed there would be difficult talks ahead.

EU leaders endorsed stiff divorce terms for Britain on Saturday and warned Britons to have "no illusions" about swiftly securing a new relationship to keep their access to EU markets.

<TEXT> A ban on exporting coal through Canadas west coast ports would put a crimp in Trumps promises to revive US coal mining employment (promises that are likely unrealistic anyway), further endear Trudeaus government to Trumps domestic political opponents, and likely do the environment some good. Its also simply a reminder that Trump isnt the only person in global politics who can play the game of threat and bluff, and that most of his opponents in said game probably have a much stronger grasp of the underlying issues.

<TEXT> The order would essentially seek to reverse former President Barack Obamas actions to restrict offshore drilling.

Obama took drilling in the Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific oceans off the table until 2022, and blocked drilling indefinitely in select Arctic and Atlantic areas. He also implemented aggressive safety regulations on the industry.
The order would come on Trumps 99th Day in office amid a big push to close out the first 100 days of his presidency.

The Friday order would be aimed primarily at expanding drilling by directing the Interior Department to review the current schedule for offshore drilling allowances </TEXT>

<TEXT> CSRs make a genuine difference in the lives of real people. When you suffer from heart disease or cancer, you depend on regular access to your doctor for prevention and to keep your treatment on track. For someone who makes less than $18,000 a year, or a family of four living on less than $39,000 a year, even $10 or $20 is a significant cost. This program lowers out-of-pocket costs like deductibles and co-pays, making coverage more affordable. 
For example, on a typical CSR plan, a person making $18,000 a year could have their deductible lowered from $3,500 to $250 and their urgent care co-pay lowered from $75 to $25.  Without this program, millions of Americans simply could not afford their healthcare.

<TEXT> "South Korea and the United States have been working to secure an early operational capability of the THAAD system in response to North Korea's advancing nuclear and missile threat," the ministry said in a statement.

The battery was expected to be operational by the end of the year, it said.

The United States and South Korea agreed last year to deploy the THAAD to counter the threat of missile launches by North Korea. They say it is solely aimed at defending against North Korea.

But China says the system's advanced radar can penetrate deep into its territory and undermine its security, while it will do little to deter the North, and is adamant in its opposition.

"China strongly urges the United States and South Korea to stop actions that worsen regional tensions and harm China's strategic security interests and cancel the deployment of the THAAD system and withdraw the equipment," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a briefing. </TEXT>

The order  titled "Executive Order Enforcing Statutory Prohibitions on Federal Control of Education"  is in line with both Trump's campaign promises on education and what DeVos advocated for before entering the federal government.

Here is a statement from a WH official:

"This Executive Order is intended to return authority to where Congress intended -- state and local entities. Current law recognizes that, although the Federal Government has a Department of Education, state and local entities retain control over their schools. This Executive Order directs the Secretary of Education to conduct a study and determine where the Federal Government has unlawfully overstepped state and local control." </TEXT>

Trump, who has positioned herself as an advocate for women's issues in the White House, called her father's calls for paid maternity leave and better access to childcare "central" to that work.

These policies are central to the economic empowerment of women and they will ensure economic growth and job creation across the country, Trump said.

In her email to Breitbart, Trump says that supporting policies that keep women from leaving the workforce "is vital as well as breaking down the barriers for female small business owners so they can become job creators. </TEXT>

Just more than one in three respondents (37%) said they prefer that Republicans repeal and replace the ACA. By contrast, 61% would rather see Congress keep the law and work to improve it.
Democrats, as you might expect, are nearly unanimous (88%) in favor of keeping and improving Obamacare. Far more surprising to me is that one in five self-identified Republicans (21%) prefer keeping and improving the law as opposed to repealing and replacing it. Independents clearly favor the keep/improve option; two thirds say they prefer that to repealing and replacing it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Trump administration has denied a request from the House Oversight Committee for more information on payments that former national security adviser Michael Flynn received from foreign governments, including from the Kremlin-backed television station RT and other Russian firms.

Legislative affairs director Marc Short argued that the committee was requesting both documents that are not in possession of the White House because they involved Flynn's activity prior to President Trumps January 20 inauguration and others that involved sensitive information.

"It is unclear how such documents would be relevant to the stated purpose of the committee's review, which according to your letter is to examine Lt. Gen. Flynn's disclosure of payments related to activities that occurred in 2015 and 2016, prior to his service in the White House," Short wrote in a letter dated April 19, sent to committee leaders.

In March, the committee sent a letter to the White House and the Defense Department demanding a range of records related to the payments Flynn, who also worked on Trumps campaign and presidential transition, received.
On Tuesday morning, the committee reviewed a batch of documents responsive to the request from the Pentagon, behind closed doors.

Flynn did not list the payments from Russian companies in his original financial disclosure forms submitted in February. He filed an amended disclosure last month reporting payments for speeches from three Russian-linked companies, including RT, but the move has remained under scrutiny amidst the FBIs ongoing investigation into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia during the election.

Flynn was forced to resign in February after it came to light that he had misled Vice President Pence and the public about the content of a phone call with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyac.

The former intelligence official has offered to testify before the Senate and House Intelligence committees  which are both investigating Russian interference in the election  in exchange for immunity, but neither committee has accepted the offer.

Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) had recently suggested that Flynn could potentially be on the hook for tens of thousands of dollars in remittance to the U.S. government </TEXT>

They wrote: "By articulating a legal basis for military action, as well as laying out a strategic vision for such action, a president provides a justification for the use of the momentous power to commit American lives to a cause, but also an understanding of the limits of those powers."

Trump ordered the strike without Congressional permission on April 6 in direct response to the chemical attack in Syria by Assad's regime. </TEXT>

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called Trump's remarks "offensive and wrong" and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a staunch ally of Trump, called the comments "inexcusable" and "one of the worst mistakes Trump has made."

<TEXT> While it's unclear what direction the Trump administration is going to take in handling marijuana legalization in US states, Department of Homeland Security secretary John Kelly was rather clear about where he stands on the issue.

And like Attorney General Jeff Sessions did earlier today, Kelly sounded the alarm against trans-national crime organizations.

"And let me be clear about marijuana. It is a potentially dangerous gateway drug that frequently leads to the use of harder drugs," Kelly said in a speech he's giving now at George Washington University. "CBP will continue to search for marijuana at sea, air and land ports of entry and when found take similar appropriate action.

DHS personnel will continue to investigate marijuanas illegal pathways along the network into the U.S., its distribution within the homeland, and will arrest those involved in the drug trade according to federal law.
So far, seven states  including Washington, California, Colorado and Massachusetts  have legalized recreational use of marijuana. And a total of 27 states in the US have legalized medical marijuana. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jon Ossoff, a 30-year-old political novice, is leading a field of 18 candidates for a U.S. House of Representatives seat that was vacated when Trump named Tom Price as his health secretary.

An Ossoff win would not tip the balance of power in Washington but could weaken the already shaky hold Trump has on his fellow Republicans by encouraging lawmakers to distance themselves from him.

Georgia's 6th District has elected Republicans to the House since the late 1970s, but Trump only carried it by 1 percentage point in the November presidential election.

Ossoff hopes to win an outright majority in Tuesday's vote, a "jungle primary" with all 18 candidates from both parties on the same ballot. If no one reaches 50 percent, the top two vote-getters square off on June 20. </TEXT>

<TEXT> President Donald Trump is claiming he cannot be sued now that he has won the White House -- a defense in a lawsuit that alleges Trump incited rally-goers to violence when they allegedly assaulted protesters during the 2016 campaign.

In a court filing Friday, Trump's lawyers argue twice that the President has blanket immunity against lawsuits.
"Mr. Trump is immune from suit because he is President of the United States," the attorneys wrote, adding, "Mr. Trump is immune from proceedings pursuant to Clinton v. Jones."
In the case, three protesters, Kashiya Nwanguma, Molly Shah and Henry Brousseau, accuse two men, Alvin Bamberger and Matthew Heimbach, of assaulting them at a Kentucky rally in March 2016. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NASA has new evidence that the most likely places to find life beyond Earth are Jupiter's moon Europa or Saturn's moon Enceladus. In terms of potential habitability, Enceladus particularly has almost all of the key ingredients for life as we know it, researchers said.

New observations of these active ocean worlds in our solar system have been captured by two NASA missions and were presented in two separate studies in an announcement at NASA HQ in Washington today.
Using a mass spectrometer, the Cassini spacecraft detected an abundance of hydrogen molecules in water plumes rising from the "tiger stripe" fractures in Enceladus' icy surface. Saturn's sixth-largest moon is an ice-encased world with an ocean beneath. The researchers believe that the hydrogen originated from a hydrothermal reaction between the moon's ocean and its rocky core. If that is the case, the crucial chemical methane could be forming in the ocean as well.
"Now, Enceladus is high on the list in the solar system for showing habitable conditions," said Hunter Waite, leader of the Cassini Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer team at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio and lead author of the Enceladus study. </TEXT>

Cruz, who made a Monday trip to Wichita, told the radio host that he stumped for GOP candidate Ron Estes because "the numbers were looking close" -- and that his party should view the narrow margin as a red flag.
"I think the election was certainly a warning sign," Cruz said.
RELATED: Republicans keep Kansas House seat in special election
There are dangers in reading too much into the Kansas race. Special elections, political operatives say, are like snowflakes -- each taking place in unique circumstances. In Kansas, Republican Gov. Sam Brownback is hugely unpopular. And national Democrats' refusal to spend money helping Thompson meant the race flew under the radar -- which some Democrats argued could have left Republican voters feeling no sense of urgency to turn out to vote.
The Georgia contest will be a much more accurate barometer of the national mood.
For weeks, money has flooded into the northern Atlanta suburbs. Democrat Jon Ossoff has raised $8.3 million -- and the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC have spent millions attacking him -- ahead of the 18-person "jungle primary." With a fractured, 11-candidate Republican field, Democrats hope Ossoff can cross the 50% threshold and avoid a June one-on-one runoff with the leading GOP candidate.
The race is also squarely focused on national issues and Trump in particular -- unlike Kansas, where Brownback was also a central factor.
In Kansas, Cruz campaigned alongside Estes, the state treasurer, on Monday, introducing him at a rally and calling on citizens to turn out to vote.
"The danger was that many good conservative Kansans wouldn't pay much attention to the election and wouldn't show up," Cruz said. "I wanted to do everything I could to help turnout."

To avoid future losses, Republicans must follow through on pledges made to constituents, Cruz said.
"The way to do it is deliver on our promises," Cruz said. "That is what I am urging every day." </TEXT>

<TEXT> The FBI and Justice Department obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant to monitor the communications of Page, who has called himself a junior member of Trump's foreign policy advisory team, as part of their investigation into possible ties between Trump's campaign and Russia, the newspaper says, citing unnamed law enforcement and other US officials.
The FBI and Justice Department obtained the warrant after convincing a FISA judge there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign government (Russia), the report says. The warrant presents the strongest information to date that the FBI had reason to believe a Trump adviser was in touch with Moscow and met with foreign operatives during Trump's presidential campaign. </TEXT>

"Two adults are deceased in a classroom," the chief said in a Twitter post, adding, "There are two wounded, possible students," who were taken to hospitals. He said their conditions were not immediately known.

"We believe the suspect is down, and there's no further threat," Burguan said.

<TEXT> It's too early to say whether the new reward scheme will see crowds of would-be spy-busters prowling Beijing and stopping foreigners to make sure their bow ties aren't hiding cameras.
What it will do, though, is keep the sense of threat high in people's minds.
Under President Xi Jinping, China has grown increasingly suspicious of foreign influence and ideas. Foreign organisations, foreign academics and foreign companies are facing greater scrutiny and surveillance.
National security laws have also been beefed up, ostensibly to counter the actions of other governments but also, critics argue, in ways that allow the authorities to crack down further on dissent at home.
No-one doubts that China, like all major world powers, is a target for espionage. But however real that threat, raising the spectre of hostile foreign forces to rally domestic support can be a useful tool and it wouldn't be the first time that the Chinese authorities have reached for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Residents of the Chinese capital can earn up to 500,000 yuan (58,000; $72,000) by submitting tip-offs.
City officials said the public should help "to slowly construct an iron Great Wall in combating evil and guarding against spies".
Authorities launched an awareness campaign last year, including warnings against being seduced by foreign spies.
The new regulation was announced by the security branch of the Beijing municipal government. It said that residents could file tip-offs through the hotline launched last year in person or by post.
The cash rewards range from 10,000 to 500,000 yuan, depending on how useful the tip-offs are in "preventing or stopping espionage behaviour, or cracking espionage cases", according to several state media outlets including Beijing Daily. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Clinton said Trump needs to come up with a strategy in Syria after the airstrikes. She also took the moment to address the change in Trump's tone when it came to Syria  and refugees.

Here's her full quote:

I am going to get to the meat of the matter but I wanted to say just a few words about Syria. Look, Syria has been a wicked problem for a very long time and the images of innocent people, of parents and especially of children suffering in the aftermath of that most recent deadly gas attack were more appalling than I certainly can put into words. As I said yesterday afternoon, I said it is essential that the world does more to deter Assad from committing future murderous atrocities. But the action taken last night needs to be followed by a broader strategy to end Syrias civil war.

And to eliminate ISIS strongholds on both side of the border, so I hope this administration will move forward in a way that is both strategic and consistent with our values and I also hope that they will recognize that we cannot in one breath speak of protecting Syrian babies and in the next close American doors to them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bannon's removal from the NSC, which includes senior members of Trump's foreign policy team, was seen as a boost to national security adviser H.R. McMaster, who officials said has struggled to work together with Bannon.

A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bannon's presence on the NSC was no longer needed after the departure of Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn.

Flynn was forced to resign in February over his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kisylak, prior to Trump's taking office on Jan. 20. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oil prices lowest since November on higher US inventories

Oil prices are at near four-month lows after the latest figures showed US crude inventories rose faster than expected, exacerbating fears of over supply.

Brent crude is down 1.6% at $50.15 a barrel, and fell as low $50.05 earlier, the lowest since 30 November when OPEC countries agreed to cut output to ease oversupply fears.

Figures from the American Petroleum Institute showed US inventories climbed by 4.5 million barrels to 533.6 million barrels last week, higher than analysts forecasts of 2.8 million. </TEXT>

She congratulated the President after his election win in a statement that also contained a defense of Western values -- amid concern in Germany that his stances on issues like immigration run counter to the principles that have sustained the Western alliance.
Germany, the most powerful political force in the European Union, has also been deeply concerned by Trump criticisms of NATO and deep skepticism inside the White House about the EU itself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> German and Turkish tensions are coming to a head over Turkey's continuation of state sponsored rallies within Germany. The gatherings are a means of encouraging Germany's Turkish population to back a vote supportive of a referendum that will boost President Tayyip Erdogan's powers. Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern called for an EU-wide ban on campaign appearances by Turkish politicians to prevent individual countries such as Germany from being undermined by Ankara. Additionally, Kern proposed that the EU end discussions with Turkey about EU membership and either completely cancel or restrict 4.5 billion euros in aid planned for Turkey through 2020. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu criticized the restrictions on such rallies as undemocratic. Meanwhile, Kern stated in an interview that, "Turkey has moved further and further away from Europe in the past few years. Human rights and democratic values are being trampled. Press freedom is a foreign word." </TEXT>
