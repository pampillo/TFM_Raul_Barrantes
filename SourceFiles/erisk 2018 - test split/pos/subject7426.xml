<TEXT> This looks great! Unfortunately, I think it would we are looking for a map or banner that uses the new textures and icons. As much as many of us loved the old style, they are no longer an accurate reflection of Inkarnate and the banner should reflect the most current and accurate state of the program. If you have a submission in the new style, we would love to see that too! </TEXT>

I had to delete my old gallery post in order to post this one because it used the same link. Fullest apologies to anyone who had saved/bookmarked/etc the old post.

As always, I am looking for further color suggestions and submissions to broaden the scope and depth of the gallery. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about goal funnels </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-22 17:26:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am trying to set up goal tracking for rfq forms embedded in my client's product pages. They would like tracking for form completions from each page but they all direct to the same thank-you page url. I have tried setting up conversion funnels for each goal with the product page as a required starting point for the funnel, but I ran into an issue. When an rfq was submitted on one product, other products would also appear to fire for the goal completion.

My question is this - Let's say a user clicks into a product page, triggering the first step in the funnel for that page's rfq goal. The user then clicks into another product page, triggering the rfq for that product, completes the form and lands on the thank-you page. When the second funnel is triggered, does the first one remain triggered? If so, this would explain why my goals were double-counting. I would love confirmation on this aspect of goal funnels.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll drop some unpopular advice for FFXIII for the series as a whole. Take some time out of playing the game and read the datalogs as they are given to you/updated. Seriously, do this. While I disagree with this as a world building and story forming technique, the story being told is really freaking amazing and it's a shame it was hidden behind large walls of text. It also helped me to really like Hope (which I know is another unpopular opinion). I know XIII-2 and Lightning Returns get a lot of flack (in addition to all of the normal flack) for how heavily involved Hope was in all of it. Aside from his name being a VERY clumsy metaphor, he is one of the best developed FF characters IMHO. At the start of XIII he is a young boy that throughout the series is forced to grow up and mature rapidly in response to overwhelming tragedy, loss, and "destiny" forced upon him. Sure, the other characters have to deal with this too, but they are much older and to an extent (looking at you Snow) more mature. Hope and Light's relationship is one of my favorite FF pairings due to how much they force each other to grow. This relationship is at its best in XIII and I feel is a necessary component to making the most out of their interactions in Lightning Returns.

So I digress. TL:DR Read the datalogs. And I really love Hope.

Edit to add: Anyone that tells you the story was hard to follow clearly didn't pay attention. Once you figure out the four or five pieces of jargon (L'Cie, Fal'Cie, Cocoon, Pulse, Cieth, etc) the story isn't really hard to follow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the original intention for these textures was to be used in a map like [this](http://forum.profantasy.com/extensions/InlineImages/image.php?AttachmentID=2010). You would then use other colored textures to draw out lines and add in icons, etc to fill it out. As things stand right now, I think the colors are more useful being used like the other textures because line drawing is a pain and the features make creating a parchment style map a real labor of love. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the biggest thing I've come to learn is to not worry so much about the big picture when whittling away at the coast. You likely won't lose the general shape of your map during this process and you are now creating little micro moments in your map with each section of the coast you work on. Just remember that you don't jump from a size 64 brush to a size 5 brush. Work your way down in increments to create the shapes you want and use the smallest brush sizes to define and shape the coasts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> With the blessings of /u/Spadie and /u/igagen, I have started compiling both core and user-made background textures for Inkarnate into one location. My hope is that, as more users create backgrounds, they would allow me to add it to the gallery where anyone can browse and select textures for their map. If you have textures you want added to the gallery, pm me or comment on this thread with a link to the textures.

Edit: I'm updating the image descriptions in the gallery with my thoughts and experiences working with each texture. Feel free to offer up your feedback and creative ways you've used each texture - I will add these to the gallery so that other users can benefit from our collective experience! (you may have to click through to see the updated descriptions)

Edit edit: Thanks for Reddit gold! Expect a large update in the near future in a new post. I'm hoping to have upwards of fifty textures in the gallery by then. Stay tuned! </TEXT>

I might be the only one that does this, but I like picking a color palette to use before making a map. Since we are limited in the number of color options we can upload to use, I thought it might be nice to get a "master list" of nice textures including the default as well as user-made ones that match in style.

<TEXT> Here's a regional map I did using the updated Inkarnate program. Overall, I am very happy about how it turned out, though there are some things I noticed once I got my hands dirty. Here's my list of suggestions/feedback generated from working on this map. I apologize for any redundancies that may have already been shared in the sub.

* Item scale is an issue. While most of us agree things are just too large and can't be scaled down, many of the isometric objects don't follow any logical scaling within the set. The watchtower and and windmill are massive in comparison with the cities and other towers. The cities themselves do not scale very well (setting everything at the same zoom level). The towns are all much larger in scale than the capital city icon and makes for some very strange tweaking. In this map, all the icons are at 50% while the capital is at 75%. If I could have made the towns and villages smaller, I would have but alas.

* Obligatory comment about textures.

* Coloration for the non-isometric sketch-style icons is very strange for me. Why the rusty-red color? Unless you are making a parchment style map with the lightest parchment color or are "filling in" the sketches with a different texture color, they are often lost in a even the plainest background color. If some trees or mountains are added to a map, say goodbye to any sort of visibility.

* Object layering drives me up the wall. It is very fiddly to try and prevent trees/mountains/hills/icons/etc. to layer correctly and not overlap in unrealistic ways. Having "move to front" and "move to back" for icons is nice - I would love it if we could do that for individual terrain pieces like hills, trees, and mountains. That being said...

* Terrain relocation would be a godsend. There were so many times making this map where I clicked a mountain or hill into being only to delete it because it wasn't the shape I wanted. That, or the terrain feature needed to be shifted just a little bit. Being able to rearrange terrain icons after placing them would make creating organic landscapes even easier, especially if this is coupled with object layering for terrain pieces.

* Object/terrain mirroring would be great, especially for the isometric icons. This would allow for a lot more diversity in placement and usage.

**Extra bits:**

* I wish there were icons for caves and barrows.

* The grasslands and forest lands terrain colors are very similar and can be hard to differentiate from one another. Actually, scratch that. All of the browns look similar too. While I wouldn't cut back on terrain colors, I hope future additions create more dynamic options.

* Oh how I wish the images and text were vector based and scaled better when shrunk or enlarged past their preferred resolution. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think my biggest concern is that we need more feedback from the devs moving forward. Their interaction with the community has been great following the update this weekend, but everything up to this has been large periods of silence interspersed with infrequent updates. I know that making too many hard and fast promises (regarding new assets, timeline commitments, etc) is too much to ask for because a lot can change during beta to screw up timelines. But if the devs can maintain transparency and even provide a loose road map that we can follow along with, that would be appreciated a lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Another tip I have is to browse r/mapmaking. It's a really great community that has excellent resources for beginners. There is a little bit of a stigma against Inkarnate maps on that sub though because some people view them as derivative while forgetting not all of us are as artistically inclined as others or have the resources to buy software like Campaign Cartographer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The darkened "map folds" are the borders of each if the individual maps I created in the program. I just combined each of the maps in Google draw and the end result made the six borders look like map folds. I think some people dump their large maps into photoshop and do color corrections but I'm way too lazy for that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Start small and take your time. Work from the ground up. Build your landmass first. Start with broad, clunky strokes and refine with gradually small and smaller subtraction brushes until you have a shape you like. Don't worry about realism if that's a concern for you until you've become comfortable with the tools. Make your practice fun for yourself. After you have your landmass, I usually add mountain ranges where I want them. This helps dictate terrain later on. After laying mountains, I add in rivers and lakes. Once that's done, I paint the terrain. Depending on the scale of your project, this could be one or two simple terrain features or it could be large dynamic biomes. Don't bite off more than you can chew right away and don't worry about it looking pretty right away either. Play around with different brush sizes and fade intensities to get the aesthetic you desire. Once you have your world painted, add cities and other landmarks. Remember that less is often more. For my map, my goal was to have it represent terrain and cities. If I were to do a more political map, I would exchange the terrain for a plain background and add in boarders and roads with the cities. Know what you want when you start and you'll be able to achieve that goal! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been seeing other people post their large compiled maps and thought I'd share a project I've been racing to finish before Jan 21. The geography is done (save for any last minute nit-picks) and I've been adding in the cities one nation at a time. I didn't expect it to be as time consuming as the actual terrain painting, but it has been very fulfilling watching my world come to life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah you're definitely in a situation to not have to go through therapy if your parents wanted you too. I didn't have a whole lot of choice in the matter back in 9th grade. If they do suggest therapy (of any kind) though, take a moment to think about where they are coming from. I don't think my parents knew that the church counselor was going to sit me down and tell me in our one-on-ones to either pray it away or live a life where I just don't act on my sexual feelings. Being raised in a Catholic household (granted, we were a very liberal household), the church provided an easy, cost-effective, and familiar outlet for aid for my parents because I was pretty tight-lipped about it and had shut down any communication on the matter after the letter. My parents turned to what they knew and felt comfortable with and over time I've learned not to fault them for this. So, tl;dr - sometimes people do or suggest doing the wrong thing because they don't know what else to do and are seeking the familiar. Keep an open mind and create a dialogue because that's the only way any bridges will be crossed. Best of luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I came out to my parents via letter when I was in high school. The pro of it it is that it allowed me to gather my thoughts and put them into a coherent structure that wouldn't be clouded by the heat of the moment. The mistake I made was not being open to talking to my parents about it in person. Since they couldn't break my wall of silence, they took me to a Catholic family councilor (aka thinly veiled conversion therapy). I don't really think my parents knew the damage this did but it resulted in me keeping my entire sexuality and dating life from them for eight years (not that they couldn't put bits and pieces together here and there). Hell, it took me that long to recognize that the "therapy" had affected me the way it did. They thought they were doing the right thing and I've realized I can't blame them and have forgiven them. But the moral here is that all of this could have been avoided by having a talk in person after sending that letter. Nothing can replace a real human conversation and it will need to happen sooner or later. When I finally had the talk with my folks after I graduated from college, there was a lot of healing between us.  So just be prepared for step two, because a letter can only further the conversation so far. Best of luck to you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 27 yo, 6'2" and fluctuate beteween 240-250 lb. depending on how much of a lug I am. Right now my primary goal is weight loss which I know will be made so much easier by weight lifting. I just need to do it. I'm think my biggest hurdle will be feeling comfortable in that space at the gym.

I'm using My Fitness Pal to track food and have been logging weight once a week with images. I've also started to make changes to my diet. The biggest challenge here is trying to get my husband on board with the diet changes as well because there's no way I'm shopping/cooking two unique meals a night. We are going to start bulk cooking meals because we both hate cooking on weeknights and I think this will help a lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I absolutely agree with you on this. My depression (previous to last week) mostly manifested in me being a little b**** to everyone around me for a hot moment. Since I had always had these mood swings, I didn't think anything of them until I had that "ah ha!" moment and put the pieces together.

Admission to yourself is also a huge step. Admitting that I could have depression helped alleviate the stress that was mounting around the uncertainty of it all. By the time I was actually diagnosed I didn't even think I needed to be seeking help anymore. I think the biggest take-away for me was recognizing that I need to view this as an ongoing thing rather than isolated incidents. </TEXT>

Q1: What's your favorite holiday tradition? Pre-married life, it was white elephant gifts with my dad's family. Christmas has been kinda up in the air as my husband and I settle into married life so I'm sure we'll pick up some new holiday traditions on the way!

Q2: What are you hoping is under the Christmas tree? Something leather from Sexy Gay Santa, something random and fun from my GayBro's Secret Santa, and some new vinyl from Boring Regular Santa.

Q3: What's a odd and/or interesting question that's fun to discuss? Here's an oldie but a goody and has been a good ice-breaker at weddings where I didn't know anyone. If you had no wrists, how would you masturbate? </TEXT>

I think dialogue clarifiers great training wheels while for both beginners trying their hand at conversations (they can be intimidating!) as well as long-time writers who want to experiment with how they write dialogue. Or if a room full of people are talking all at once. But for intimate conversations or a steady back-and-forth between two people, adding clarifiers can bog the dialogue down and cause it to lose its punch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> * **N. Wastes:** I'll kick off with the remaining settlements. They do not predate the war and have been developed on the bones of razed Ageis cities. I may or may not keep these where they are. I've been toying around with giving this regions the ol' "Wild West" feel but what I've been tossing around has felt half-baked. The cornerstone of this region is the ruined capital where a bunch of old malicious magics linger due to the war ending confluence of forces centralized on the city. The Ageis are keeping an eye on the ruined capital as well but have been covert about it. The ruined capital is also one of the cornerstones of the zealous Golden Temple religion practiced by conservative Manous (the more liberal alternative is the Living Church introduced by the Trellen). According to the Golden Temple, the Manous God Emperor (from the Golden War) will be reincarnated and return to claim the throne and dominion over the world. Very doomsday cult that operates on a large scale and pours a lot of money into the Manous government to ensure it doesn't go anywhere. But I digress. I think most people just want to turn their back on the region lest it open up old wounds. Now only adventure seekers, bandits etc roam the northern region and the communities existing up there are little more than self-governed pit stops and halfway houses for those who have left or been exiled from the southern nations.

* **Ballutte:** Right off the bat, this nation is a work in progress both in terms of culture and geography. Your note about settling in the rain forest resonated with me because I've been tossing around expanding the rain forest to the north of the nation further south and making it more prominent and integrated. However, that screws up the geography a little bit and puts a warm region too far south for my liking (though I am not a rain forest expert). Like I said, it's being workshopped.

* **Dworu:** Pretty much spot on. As a side note, they are also one of the few nations that isn't riding the anti-magic kick. But like I mentioned earlier, they are still unable to draw magic from within themselves. The Dworu have built a culture around ritual bloodletting where magic casting is done in pairs. One member of the pair (usually a large man with great fortitude and constitution) will let their blood which allows their partner to tap into their life force and perform acts of magic. It's a refinement on the sacrificial magics used by both the Dworu and Manous during the Golden War. Mage-pairs are usually paired for life and the pairing is made when a person's potential as a mage is discovered. The role of the bloodletter comes with its own social status and they are highly respected - especially if they live a long and notable life.

* **Vorcae (pronounced Vorkash):** Beastly as in part man, part beast. I've been toying around with how exactly I want this to be and I'm currently circling tall (8-9 ft) satyr-esque humanoids with a large rack (of antlers, that is). They are human enough to be familiar, but beastly enough to easily be labeled as others. Their allegiances belong to the Manous and Trellen, in the sense that they are fine as long as they stay where they are. Both allied nations have an unhealthy romanticist and patronizing attitude towards the Vorcae because they are exotic (think romantic/exotic attitudes towards Africans in post-emancipation United States mixed with the current American attitudes of "look the poor ethnic people...let's put on the appearance of helping them without getting our hands dirty by tweeting a hashtag or whatever"). Some of the western-most Manous cities are less racist towards them but the Golden Temple has made a hostile stance against the Vorcae that has made honest attempts at integration and true allegiance difficult. The Vorcae have been pushing north into No Man's Land but not too aggressively as one of their primary focuses has been growing their settlements in their bay region.

* **Manous:** The Manous' heartland has always been where it is now (save for when their central government was temporarily relocated to the ruined capital near the end of the Golden War). During the war, the Dworu occupied much of the land the Vorcae dwell in, pushing the Manous east. They then occupied and enslaved the Trellen (leading to the aforementioned refugees fleeing both south and east). After conquering the Trellen, the Manous marched north and conquored the Ageis (who were geographically remote). It was the Dworu, in liaison with refugee Ageis and the fractured remains of the Ageis military, who called down the meteor on what is now the ruined capital. Lots of people died, an entire race of magical beings was sacrificed, the Vorcae were created, and the Manous slunk back to their homeland where the Trellen groomed them for economic dependence. The Golden Temple church is the last vestige of the (self proclaimed) God Emperor but definitely sticks out like a sore thumb and wears its antiquity like a badge of honor. The Golden Temple gets money via donations from its members, which is then funneled back into the Manous government to further the advances and agendas of the church. Until semi recently this practice was unimpeded. However, the animism-based religion of the Trellen (the Living Church) has slowly been integrating itself as an alternative and has spread all the way to the western reaches of the Manous nation.

* **Trellen:**  Oofda, this has been a lot of writing but it's been fun. I'm following you on your comparison, though I don't know enough about historic global cultures to say for sure. The Trellen are crafty and have been watchdogs over the Manous following the war. Rather than seeking vengeance against their once-enslavers, they are killing them with "kindness" and culture. The Trellen rule through economy, though the Kon Hapi are a strong contender for this. The Trellen, also aware of the Golden Temple and all their hootenanny, have been an effective roadblock in northern expansion, choosing instead to colonize the islands off the eastern coast of the main continent. Like the Ageis, the Trellen are also keeping an eye on this region, mostly to ensure their borders are secure against any raids or attacks from the ungoverned cities. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright, second follow-up since you've added on since my last check-in. Thanks for pushing my boundaries on this - it's been super helpful!

* **Roak Ald:** Ex-refugees who fled from the Golden Manus Empire's expansion and enslavement. The initial refugee group was not huge - think maybe two to three ships of around 60 people on each ship. Mostly able bodied men and some women with very few children. By the time they land on the island, grapple with the initial struggle to survive (breaking down the boats for shelter) and regroup into a sustainable lifestyle, the initial refugee group has become pretty invested in the communities they've fostered. Additionally, very few people knew about the refugees departing (and those who did probably died in the war) so they've been pretty invisible as a nation. With no communication between them and the mainland, it's like the war may as well have not ended. By the time contact was reestablished, the Roak Ald had little to no interest in reintegrating with a global society that had reintegrated the nation that had driven these ex-refugees into exile in the first place.

* **Kon Hapi:** Fear ye not, xenophobia is still alive and well, thriving as much as the blossoming caste system. I would hesitate to say the Kon Hapi pulled a 180 so much as the wealthy ruling class saw an opportunity to make more money, increase their global presence, and seemingly do a good deed in accepting refugees during the Golden War. Make no mistake about it, the refugees and their descendants have not risen in Kon Hapi society. They have been relegated to piss poor labor jobs or straight up begging in the streets. To add to the stereotypical orientalism of it all (because I'll call it when I see it), I've been toying around with the Kon Hapi controlling one of the larger drug economies in the world. Again, it comes down to money and power.

* **Ageis:** I suppose now is as good a time as any to mention that nation names are still being work shopped. I'm using them more for their feel and as placeholders. That being said, I think your biggest point about the Ageis was who their enemies were and how their cities and borders are situated. If we are drilling down, the Ageis' biggest enemy is themselves. As a nation, they have built a post-war society solely around growing military power and being self sustaining. You mentioned a lack of ports. The don't "need" (desire) them. The sense of security they feel is both in part because of the mountains, but also because the rest of the world has been ignoring them while the Ageis have been hiding and licking their wounds. This is to the point of most of the modern world not really knowing much about the Ageis except for what is written in history books. Without downplaying the enslavement and genocide of the Ageis during the Golden War, they are like a child who had all four appendages broken by a playground bully and has been amassing a metric f***ton of nukes to get back at said bully - even after the bully has reformed and become a productive member of society. So everyone knows they are there, but the Ageis have fallen out of sight and out of mind because no one has seen them for hundreds of years. Regarding self-sustainability: the Ageis are really adept farmers and have become quite industrious as well. That region of the world is pretty resource rich, negating their need for trade.

* **Asarii:** Literal aliens. While your comment about them being magicians is somewhat relevant, the magic they wield is drawn from inner, inate power rather than external sources (spirits, the land, magical beings like the Ed'Argo). I won't dive into magic right now, but following the Golden War, magic became taboo due to the near apocalypse that occurred because of it, as well as its use in Manous military treachery. So following the war we have magic aliens who literally come in peace except no one wants them. They are a by-product of a last-ditch effort that no one wanted to deal with. The Ageis, seeing their magical utility, form a temporary alliance with them to cross the mountains, swamp and lake to where they currently reside. Once the Ageis got settled, however, they became intensely hostile to the Asarii and began a witch hunt to either kill or drive out both the Asarii and Ageis who used magic. (Again, they hopped on the no-magic train because it was used for the systematic genocide of their nation.) The Asarii fled north past the strait and set up camp, figuring out how to make the best out of a really crappy and unexpected situation. Thanks for the feedback on their location as well. I'll probably migrate their nation center closer to the coast then expand their major cities out along the steppes following the rivers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's a follow-up broken down by point:

* **Regarding Scale:** I don't have this set in stone yet, but I have a general idea that I'll try to convey here. If you look back on the map at the Manous capital, I have been working under the assumption that it would take about 2 of a day's travel on horseback at a moderate pace to travel to the city to the south/southeast by the river. Like I said, I have yet to translate that into actual numbers.

* **Regarding the North-Central Desert:** This desert was created as the result of two factors happening in quick succession. I realize this may have been lost in the imgur album because the images got reordered after I had written the descriptions. The first factor is the massive amounts of magic that was drained from this region at the end of the Golden War to summon a meteor down on what is now the Ruined Capital. Additionally, a large amount of magic was used by protect the same city from the meteor (which is why it still stands). Not only was the land sapped of its natural magics, but the Dworu and Ageis bound and sacrificed the Ed'Argo (elemental beings/caretakers of natural magics) in order to summon and contain the meteor without destroying the entire world. It was pretty apocalyptic stuff and has permanently scarred the region because the Ed'Argo are no longer around to work on restoring magic to that land.

* **NE Frontier Wastes:** I'll admit to a bit of laziness here and you caught me in it. You might have been able to infer this from the descriptions in the imgur album, but my most fleshed out nations/regions are the Manous/Trellen/Vorcae trifecta as well as the Ageis.  Because of this, the land north of Ballutte is a little under-developed. I intended this wasteland to be the result of two factors - proximity to the equator (which is north of the map) and lack of fresh water in the region. Because the region is so arid, a lot of the topsoil (mostly sand) is picked up by the coastal winds and blown south where it "fouls" the land. I think over time the whole region will experience natural desertification that will only be impeded by the mountains.  As far as previous settlements in that region, I have no doubt the Ageis and later the occupying Manous sailed eastward. However, like settling there now is a financial and resource drain on the Trellen and Ballute, it was certainly so for the Ageis and Manous and likely abandoned. Since the Golden War put a large hold on expansion and drew most citizens of warring nations back to the main continent, any attempt at colonization was abandoned. Lastly, I wanted a "final frontier" on my map and this was the region. Without going into too many details, there is another continent far to the northeast of Ul Uren and the NE Wastes would be the closest landing point for them on discovery voyages. If I write anything in that region (I don't have anything planned) there will probably be some foreigners on the northeastern shore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello fellow world builders! In prep for NaNoWriMo, I've been hard at work laying the foundation for a world that has been kicking around in my headspace for a few years now. I finally bunkered down on Inkarnate (say what you want - it's easy to work on at work) and have what I would consider the closest draft to my vision of this world.

I am looking for feedback on geography first and foremost. Comments on the placement of each nation's capitals is also welcome if you have strong opinions. The rest of the cities are placeholders and will likely move around. The album has more description in it to help you get a sense of the world.

Edit: Fixed the order of the images in the album (you might have to click through), updated main map image with distance scale and compass. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's some solid feedback regarding the desert and it's something I'm definitely still workshopping. The desert terrain color in Inkarnate was an easy and identifiable method for me to codify that region and I just rolled with it. With where I'm at in the rest of my world building (everything else has been localized around Stormwatch and Chalk Beach) I haven't had to make and real hard and fast decisions with that region.

Edit: names are still being workshopped as well. I'm sure you can relate, but they are one of those things where you throw a million things at the board until you find something perfect and it sticks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks! When I was about half way through making the map I had the same realization about the shape of the geography! One of my biggest pet peeves are city names that are all fluff and no substance. I grew up in a rural area where all the towns were named after either a geographic landmark, the founder, or their some aspect of their history. I find this to be a more realistic way of naming cities and towns and I agree - it conveys flavor that "Thollulagazlah, Capitol of Chacharalamadamadingdong" doesn't quite give. :p </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's some good food for thought. I haven't decided yet if I want the desert to be a "living" thing that is continuing to expand (creeping corruption) or if it is stagnant yet hella permanent. As far as a centralized location for where the magic occurred, I don't really feel there was one. See the updates I made above, but the magic was cast on multiple battlefronts in a collective effort to push the Manous theocracy back. This resulted in several meteors colliding with the planet and a dramatic reshaping of the terrain (things looked waaaaaay different prior to the end of the war). What is left of the desert once things settle down only represents maybe a third of the region where that final battle was waged against the God-Emperor's forces.

<TEXT> Thanks for the feedback. I should have mentioned this earlier - don't know why I forgot. The desert is not a naturally forming feature. It was the result of a large amount of magic being performed as well as the sacrificing of a few quasi-godlike entities. Otherwise I totally agree - it's super out of place. </TEXT>

A mountain and crags dwelling race that I envision as about 75% humanoid and 25% elk. Not really centaurian, more satyr. Real tall - talking between 8 and 9 ft.

Fallen angels. Well, not really angels. But if a humanoid race was generally viewed of/thought of themselves as fallen angels. Again, go wild. Also, most other races generally hate these guys because they are dicks.

Albino, crippled cave slaves. Bred over multiple generations into their current state - used to be regular ol' humans. The more twisted, the better.

<TEXT> Howdy world builders! I'm looking for either general feedback on my map but would love specific criticism on river, mountain and forest location. Feel free to pepper me with questions.

A little background information: There are four nations represented on the map, though it was not a goal of mine to have this map represent the political boundaries. The two main nations represented are the Manous and Vorcae. To the east reside the Trellen and to the west reside the Ageis.

**Manous Democracy**
The Manous Democracy occupies most of the region to the east of the Blackmirror Mountains that form a spine down the peninsula. Its capitol, New Union, represents the second iteration of the Manous people. The old capitol, Ash Throne, is one of the few remaining vestiges of the heretical Manous Theocracy. The theogracy once spanned the entire region depicted in the map, as well as most of the Ageis and Trellen regions, enslaving the other nations as it conquered them. The Manous have made reparations with the Trellen nation and have began naval trading with them across the semi land-locked sea. The Ageis are still openly hostile to the Manous and hold an uneasy peace enforced by the desert they border.

**Vorcae Clanholds**
The Vorcae Clanholds are the result of the young race slowly transitioning into a loose form of centralize governance. The two regional centers of governance are Four Winds and First Cave. The Vorcae are a much younger race than the other three, having formed after the God-Emperor War that shattered the Manous theocracy. The Manous helped lead the Vorcae into the modern world and the two nations hold each other in very high regard. Because of this, the Vorcae act as a watchful eye on the desert to monitor any Ageis activity.

**Trellen City-States**
The Trellen City-States are a collection of self-governed hubs of commerce and industry. This nation is a leader in invention and the arts and is quick to adapt to changing circumstances. The city of Reach is the center of their northwestern most city state and is the port-of-call for the newly created naval trade routes with the Manous nation.

**Ageis Empire**
The Ageis Empire clings to the vestiges that remain of their culture from before the God-Emperor War. As a result of their enslavement and subsequent genocide, they seek violent reparations against the Manous empire and their Vorcae allies. The only thing stopping them, ironically, is the desert they created during the God-Emperor War. The desert was created as a result of a large consumption of magic that killed thousands of spell casters as well as ruthlessly sacrificed several quasi-godlike beings in order to put an end to the Manous Theocracy's regime of war and genocide. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wouldn't worry about *how* to read the books. Like The_Chrononaut said, they are just books. Just take your time with them and trust in the author. Sure, you won't understand a lot as you start the series. Hell, it was only by Mo! (book 3) that I started to feel like I was really getting my footing in the world. But also remember that SE has dedicated 10,000 pages to developing the world, its characters, and the tangled skein of plots and subplots. As long as you don't rush through and skip large parts of the narrative, you should do just fine.

As an aside, my mom has been spacing each of the Malazan books with a smaller, lighter read. She's had a bit more trouble keeping track of the characters and plots than I have, but I've been reading them one after another. The Tor re-read is invaluable and I read it after every chapter or after a group of chapters (if I plow through a bunch in one sitting). I would stay off the wiki and come here with questions - we are far less likely to spoil something for you than the wiki is! </TEXT>

I carry these to work and they are in and out of my work bag every day, as well as travelling with me on trips.

<TEXT> I agree with you there - Heboric is the King of the Vaguebooking Warren when it comes to actually articulating what's going on. I'm on DoD right now and there a section where [DoD Spoiler](/s "he's sailing across the wasteland like some god damn ghostly apparition while communicating with Kalyth in her dreams. Wtf Heboric...I only understood about 0.015% of what was going on with his monologuing but it was interesting nonetheless.") I do think Heboric is a bit of a cypher - I'd be interested if that feeling is lessened in a reread as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Poor Heboric! I feel like I'm one of the few who really enjoy the Heboric plots. For me, his entire storyline echoes the prologue of GotM when Whiskeyjack tells Paran it's best to avoid the attention of the gods. Heboric was a priest of Fener who, through his studies and research, drew too much attention from maybe not gods, but his contemporaries. When we pick up with him in DG, I see him very much living WJ's "it's best to be avoided" philo. Which, obviously, does not happen. I really pity Heboric because his intense desire to be left alone coupled with his researcher's desire to understand everything plus god knows how many different forces vying for control over him....it's no wonder his mind is so rattled once we get to BH. This is a man driven, nay, forced towards an enlightenment he didn't seek out after losing his hands to the priests of Fener and it is reflected in how broken he eventually becomes.

Not trying to convince you to *love* Heboric...but he's far from the worst offender in the series in terms of being vague and rambling and coo coo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not worried about the series paying off! The rest of the plot lines have my full attention. I'm just getting a little frustrated with the extreme usage of rape and torture. I was beginning to get uncomfortable in RG with Janath's imprisonment(s) and rape(s) and the Barghast plot seems to have jumped in right where that left off in terms of intensity and is building to something much more violent.

So I guess, to recap, I'm not worried about the series as a whole paying off - I'm worried that the Barghast plot line exists only to portray the brutality of tribal rape culture and won't be elevated beyond that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright guys...I've whipped through the first eight books and have finally hit my first roadblock with the Barghast plotline in DoD. I'm on Chapter 11 right now and thank the stars the Letharii/Malazan plot is a break from the Barghast rape-this, rape-that narrative.

I can stomach a lot of stuff, but this snippet:  
Hed take the front half of her feet, a single merciful chop of his cutlass, once, twice. And then hed rape her. And then hed throw her out and all his friends would take their turn. Theyd fill her. Her mouth, the places between her thighs and cheeks. Three could take her all at once. 

and then this snippet:
His wife raped and the toes clipped from her feet, so making her a Hobbler, lower than a camp cur, forced to lift her backside to any man at any time and in any place.

are really testing my patience.  So I need some encouragement. No spoilers, but does this pay off? I'm echoing a lot of Amanda's thoughts from the Tor reread at this point and just want a gentle assurance that this isn't Erikson reminding us of tribal brutality just for the hell of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From my understanding (which is limited and based on speculation), force healing leaves the body in shock because it intertwines both Denul and the body's own energy to stitch things back up. To put it in perspective, imagine you broke your arm and I used magic to make things better. Rather than casting a good ol' Final Fantasy cure on you and making it all better, I would use magic to stitch the flesh and bone back together, put it in place, seal up the wound, cauterize it, set it, and wrap it all up in a nice little bow. Not necessarily in that order, but you get the idea. Meanwhile, if you are conscious, you are probably feeling both incredible amounts of pain as well as the physical sensation of me performing magical surgery on you.

Additionally, as with non-magical surgery, some users of Denul are better and can sew people up more proficiently. If your mage does a slapdash job on your arm, odds are it's been put back together okay...but not perfect. Your mind is now trying to reconcile having an arm that's healed...but maybe immobile, or twisted.  A better mage will do a better job, but from my understanding its very difficult (neigh impossible) for a mage to heal an injury so that it is in just as good of condition as if you had not been injured.

TL;DR: Imagine being awake during surgery. Without pain meds. While in shock from your injury. At least, I think that's what would happen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Howdy! Glad you are enjoying your read of HoC, even if it isn't your favorite. A lot of what happens in this book is set up for a lot of things to come in the following books, but I will try to alleviate some of your confusion as best as I can. It's been a while since I've read HoC so I am going to err on giving you less information lest I spoil something for you.

What the Nascent is/where the Nascent came from is RAFO. As are the backstories for Trull and Onrack. I remember being confused as well (I actually didn't put it together that Trull was in the HoC prologue until the Tor reread) but you'll get lots of details further down the road.

My memories are hazy regarding the Tiste Liosan and the pursuing T'lan Imass so I'm afraid I won't be much help there. As such, I am also only on DoD, so if they get more clarification down the road, I am not aware of it yet. I do know that you'll get some more semi-related details later in the book, so RAFO! With regards to the T'lan ritual in the Nascent, I would check out the Tor reread. They usually do a pretty good job summarizing those sections and Amanda has voiced a lot of the confusions I had as a first-time reader and they clear them up.

I barely remember Kalam's plot in this book...sorry!

EDIT: Remembered what you were talking about with the enkaral (but super vaguely) and I would definitely hop over to the Tor reread. I don't remember this getting a lot of clarification (and frankly I don't think it was super important in the long view) but they will at least touch on it and provide a summary over at the reread.

So...I guess this is a whole lot of RAFO and not a whole lot of clarity. I guess the moral of this story would be to trust SE and continue to plunge head-first into HoC and the books to come! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Destril slowly spun around on crouched haunches as he closed himself in a thick black circle of charcoal.  He drew slowly, to make sure the band was unbroken, though he wasn't sure if this mattered. The charcoal crumbled easily in his unsteady hand as he pressed it into the compact dirt of the road beneath him. The circle was small - wedged between the ancient depressions of wagon ruts, but it was large enough for him to stand in.

*A simple circle will have to do. I don't know any runes anyhow, and I've run out of charcoal. Gods help me, I have no idea what I'm doing..but I have got to move this boulder off the road so I can deliver my fresh baked pies to Lingonvalle!*

The intrepid baker stood erect, fumbling with his hands. After debating whether to keep them at his side or fold them together in prayer, he opted for a happy median and laced his finger together, letting them fall below his waist and rest on his belt buckle. Closing his eyes, he attempted to center his mind and focus. Destril was unsure of what to do next as he had never summoned before. Nor had he ever seen someone summon. A cool breeze kissed the back of his neck, slick with recent perspiration.

*Spirits? Hello?* Destril felt foolish. His thumbs twiddled restlessly above his belt buckle, betraying his attempts to find a calm and focused center. *Damn it...this is insane! How is a stupid circle supposed to help me reach out to an earth spirit? This isn't as easy as Thessy tells about in her stories. I though spirits were supposed to just be floating around and stuff!*

     Actually, we are.

Destril started but remained upright. The hair on his arms rose in a ghostly shiver that traveled down his spine and anchored him in a frightened paralysis. Keeping both eyes closed, the baker reached out with his mind towards the disembodied voice.

*Are you a spirit? I need your help...I need to get to Lingonvalle to deliver my pies but a boulder has fallen onto the road and blocked the entrance to the pass. Without my pies, the whole village -*

     I see. Well then. Very interesting. So be it. Are you ready?

Destril barely nodded his head before his body was filled with a dense, rumbling energy. He saw in his mind's eye a haggard giant   with crystalline lodestone eyes looking down at him, into him. The energy inside him was condensing and he felt as if he was going to be crushed beneath the weight and pressure of an ancient mountain. *Gods help me! I was unprepared!* Destril cried out in his mind as the spirits power flowed through him, unaware of all else but a quickly fleeing sense of control. He attempted to scream but his body was not his. The spirit closed in on his mind and then suddenly all was calm. The raging storm of energy and immense pressure i his body were lifted and Destril floated in a sea of calm.

     What kind of pie?

The sudden and specific nature of the question startled the baker. *Cherry, and blackberry. And maybe a few rhubarb, I believe.*

    Good. I like rhubarb.

The spirit let loose a slow, relieved sigh and suddenly Destril was looking through his own eyes again, connected with his own body, anchored to the road below by his own feet. The spirits power still flowed through him, but now it was his to command. *I have control. I can harness its power!* Unlacing his fingers, the baker raised one hand toward the problematic boulder and gave a flick of the wrist. The spirits power lashed out and the obstacle was flung to the side as one might bat away a fly.

With the road clear, Destril took a breath and stepped out of the circle. His mind was still buzzing with the spirit's power as he staggered to his delivery cart. Resting one arm on his trusty mule, his knees buckled then gave out as the spirit reasserted its dominance over Destril's mind and body.

     Pie. It is time.

His hands were not his own and his mouth was not his own. Destril's eyes were his own, however, as he watched the spirit use his body to ransack his precious pies stacked in neat, assorted rows in search of one that would sate his hunger. Cherry pies were flung in the air, landing in emphatic splats on the dirt road. Blackberry pies crumbled beneath his possessed hands as they clawed in search of a singular desire. When it seemed like all Destril's pies were to meet an untimely and wasteful demise, he spotted one lone rhubarb dessert resting atop his travel bag. His body lurched forward and tore open the flimsy wrapping. Destril ravenously ate but did not taste and before long the pie was but a messy memory and an empty baking tin.

     Very well. It has been so long but it was worth the wait. I will not trick you into summoning me again. Deliver your pies, but if you think of me, leave a rhubarb by the roadside.

No sooner had the spirit issued its request, Destril gasped as it left his body and fled to wherever spirits live when they are not possessing bakers or blocking mountain passes with boulders. The poor man, who concluded, in hindsight, that he had gotten himself in way over his head, lay spread eagle in the carriage of his cart. Seemingly discontent with waiting, the mule clipped into motion and carried the exhausted baker into the mountain pass toward Lingonvalle to deliver his pies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of my races (the Dworu), augment their magic casting (a system based on summoning, dominating, and channeling the will of an otherworldly being to perform arcane acts) with blood rituals. In order to strengthen their control over the summon circles to bind the spirit within them, they perform self-mutilation and inscribe the circles and runes in their own blood. The Dworu believe that the more of one's own blood they can pour onto the ritual, the stronger and more powerful the arcane act they are committing will be. This rides a fine line, however, because too much blood loss can lead a mage to pass out or become too weak to exert the dominance of will necessary to summon. This has a myriad of side effects, all of which range from bad to catastrophic.

Additionally, the women among the Dworu are considered superior mages, especially during their period of menstruation. During their cycle, female mages will freely flow onto the summoning circle, believing this blood to be more strongly connected to their soul.

Like all summoning, there is a high amount of risk involved. While the use of blood does allow the Dworu mages to summon greater spirits, the blood link provides a direct link to the caster's soul and will. This would make it easier for a stronger spirit to dominate a mage, rather than having to fight through mental barriers created by mages who forgo blood rites.

Lots *and lots* of Dworu mages die (from blood loss or loss of control) but the use of blood ritual has made them superior casters compared to the other races. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There has been a long standing cold war between the Ageis Empire and Manous Commonwealth. The Manous (in earlier history) had been ruled by a highly militaristic theocracy that had pushed the Ageis first into slavery, then to the brink of extinction. After enlisting the aid of other nations to quell the Manous threat and dissolve the theocracy, the Ageis hardened into a rigid military state ready to pounce on the Manous should they pose a threat once more. (Side note: the terms and limits of what this *threat* would constitute has always been vague...)

The Manous did a complete 180 during their reformation and became a polytheistic commonwealth. While they are generally aware of the watchful eye of the Ageis, they have made reparations with the other races (even fostering a race out of their stone age and into a sort of pre-modernity). The Ageis recognize that if they were to declare war on the Manous, they would be invoking war against myriad other nations. This has kept them at bay, despite long-standing animosity that has fermented into a black and bitter hatred unable to acknowledge the changes made by the Manous race. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Magic users in my world are generally feared and avoided (and usually for a good reason). Magic users perform their arcane acts by summoning demons, ghosts, elementals, and other otherworldly beings into their world and channel their power. The spell caster becomes a conduit for the summoned beings power and the caster must exercise total dominance of will over the being it has summoned.  Failing to do so may result in possession, insanity, or death. In the worst case scenario, the summoned being may actually be able to enter the world through the eviscerated carcass of the careless mage.  For this reason, most people tend to fear those who can perform arcane acts and are quick to start literal witch hunts.

On the flip side, some spell casters are so renown for their indomitable will and mastery over summoned beings that they are feared as though one might fear a vengeful god. Their power ensures that they will not be turned on by the masses but also makes them wild cards during times of global conflict.

Various world powers secretly employ mage sects who, through group channeling, are able to *slightly* more safely cast larger and more complex magic that would require the use of a more powerful summoned spirit. There is still a large element of risk, but if one mage were to falter in will, the others can still attempt to contain the spirit.

Lastly, there are few "home brew" mages because the process of summoning and channeling spirits involves a certain amount of preparation and ritual. It is difficult to perform these acts in secret, especially as one attempts to invoke the power of stronger summons. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would think about *who* is naming/originally named the deities. What practices do those cultures employ when naming themselves? Are there special suffixes or permutations they add to names to denote rank or status? How was the diety discovers or how did it rise to power? Was the god always a god or was it once mortal?

If the god's name predates the cultures who worship it, does it have a true name that is not used by its worshipers but may instead be used by other deities in the pantheon? If the god gave itself a name, why did it choose it? What does the name reflect about the god, both if the name is chosen or given to it?

Do multiple cultural groups worship the same deity (either known or unbeknownst to them)? If so, do they use the same name, or does each culture have a unique name for the god?

This could easily (and has probably) started to snowball, but you get the idea. I realize this is less of a "how to" and more of a "things to think about," but I hope it's helpful nonetheless! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Artist needed - Designing the raw landscape of Ul Uren </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-22 22:52:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello! Longtime lurker, first time poster and all that jazz. Regardless, thank you first and foremost to all those who post here for making this a fantastic sub.

TL;DR: I want someone to illustrate the world I have envisioned, preferably for free (but I would always acknowledge the artist if used in an official capacity and if this made me money, I would discuss payment).

I am looking for an artist (or at least someone with more artistic skills than myself) to put the pen to paper and sketch out the oceans, continents, and major geographic features of the world of Ul Uren. I'll include a description below, but the reason I am seeking a separate set of eyes and hands is for a few reasons. A) I have a vision of the sweeping vistas, but I can never translate those into hard and fast continents and oceans, etc without going crazy. B) I am not looking for someone to dot my world with cities and country borders and other man-made artifices. I am looking for an artistic representation of the raw, untouched world. I plan on dropping all the man-made stuff in later, but I want those to reflect the world in which they were made, rather than the other way around. C) This world (while in a fantasy setting) is a little alien and though I have a lot of visions, I want to feel the sense of alienation as I build the rest of the world. I feel that building my world off of someone else's artistic rendering of my raw vision (cue Inception music) will aid in this.

Without further ado, here is what I have cooked up thus far. Again, this is just info on the raw landscape and terrain. Races, cultures, and other man-made artifices are not important right now. Yes, I have them in the back of my mind, but no, they are not important.

In the world of Ul Uren, the laws of nature and physics act similarly to our own. One key difference is the existence of two moons, one a similar distance away like the Earths moon, while the second, smaller moon hangs equidistant between Ul Uren and the larger moon. Both appear to be about the same size in the sky. The existence of two moons causes the tides on Ul Uren to vary vastly in size between high and low tide as well as make the coastlines virtually uninhabitable. Large tidal waves ravage the coasts worldwide and make sea travel very risky. Ul Uren also has no axial tilt, eliminating the potential of seasonal periods.
While land-dwelling animals are generally comparable to their mundane counterparts on earth, there is less diversity due to the loss of seasonality. Additionally, no species exhibits migratory patterns and plant life does not revolve around strict annual cycles. The oceans, which comprise of roughly 90% of the planets surface, are inhabited by primordial beasts referred to as titans. These titans range in size and shape but are among the most dangerous and diverse creatures on the planet. They have evolved into highly competitive predators and pose a great threat to those who choose to brave the oceans.
Ul Uren is an entirely different planet, despite having many similarities to our world. Three main continents make up the land mass of Ul Uren and they are clustered closely together on one side of the planet. The rest of the planet is a restless, unexplored ocean. The northern and southern poles of the planet are capped in thick ice that does not melt. The two larger continents support most of the life on Ul Uren and arc around one another to form a large, semi-inland sea that connects to the larger ocean via rocky straights between each continent. The third continent is much smaller than the other two and is the result of a large comet colliding with the planet. It rests between the two larger landmasses in the northwestern region of the inland sea. 
The inland sea experiences less destructive tides, though the difference between high and low tide can still be between a quarter to half a mile. On the outer edge of the continents, the tide can consume between a mile to a mile and a half of shoreline. The coastal geography varies between flat expanses that support little to no life due to the tidal impact and large, sheer cliff faces that rise above the ocean and provide a buffer between the land and rising water. The northern and southern continents are dotted with smaller lakes and seas, many of which feed back into the ocean. Civilization has built up around these inland water features and only the brave or foolish attempt to settle near either the greater or lesser ocean.
Desertification has corroded the coastline and inland regions along the equator. The loose, arid soil and dry crusts of mountainous rock formation in this region maintain a delicate balance that prevents these regions from being swept away by the tide. The hot temperatures make it very difficult to live in this region and only the hardiest of wildlife claims this as a habitat. The deserts give way to grasslands both further north and south of the equator, though areas where tides lay claim to the land are reduced to swampy beaches. 
Large stretches of mountains separate dense forests from both the tide and desert. Mountains near the coastlines are shaped by the tide, their once craggy surfaces smoothed into a smooth, resilient wall providing a barrier against the tidal waves. Inland mountains bear more jagged features and are weathered more naturally. They are home to more life and provide the most stability and security against the threat of flooding. The inland and coastal mountains shelter forests from both erosion and flooding, as well as trapping rain. Closer to the equator, the forests are much more tropical, though the trees grow thinner and more resilient to the cold as they progress towards the poles. 
Like the desert, the forests give way to grasslands, though they are textured will rolling hills. In the northern continent, lakes dot the vast stretches of plains and feed rivers that flow out to the ocean. Some rivers, if born from a high enough altitude, empty into the ocean from magnificent waterfalls hundreds of feet tall at low tide, only to be reduced to shadows of their former glory at high tide. Other rivers simply wind their way down towards the swampy beaches of the lowland and empty into the murky swill. The southern continent has a few lakes, but since the continent is much thinner and consists of more lowland areas than the northern continent, many areas cannot sustain lakes against the encroaching tide. 
The regions of the continents closest to the poles grows much colder than at the equator. There is less daylight in these regions and the land devolves into a treeless expanse of permafrost and glacier formation. In these regions the tide pushes large sheets of ice against the coast and glacial mountains may be temporarily formed as ice is thrown around. Ice-locked poles exist at the northern- and southern-most reaches of Ul Uren, but they are too far away to safely travel to.
Stretching out from all outward-facing sides of the two main continents are mountainous islands. Some larger islands contain more geographic variety such as forests and small, hilly plains but most are barren formations of jutting stone. A few larger islands off the coast of the two continents are capable of supporting life, but travel to them is very dangerous and unpredictable.
In the sea between the two continents lies the remains of a comet. The continent is actually a very large island that is not grounded to the seabed. Instead, the mass floats atop the ocean as a result of large pockets of air trapped in the comet during impact. Because of this, the land mass drifts around the sea and rises with the tide, allowing those who live on it to live closer to the coastline. The land is mostly a barren, rocky expanse, but some small vegetative life has taken hold. Small creatures such as rodents and insects have also found a home on the comet, but the island cannot support larger forms of life on its own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's a matter of perspective. To me, the Nimander plot is really Lovecraftian. Sure, I'm not really sure how it's all going to tie in (but I have the faith!) and sure, I don't really think it's worth them going through all this effort to safe Clip. But the sense of forbidding mystery, as well as their pairing with Kallor, has led to some great scenes of dark tension. It also moves along a bit more briskly than the other parts of the Black Coral chapters which is a nice relief from Endest and Siland brooding. Seerdomin has started to kill people so we will see where that goes, but so far Nimander's plot has offered the most immediate action in those chapters to balance out the heavier philosophy and long-view historic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I totally agree with you there. His longevity really plays into this - after such a long life, I really feel he has been whittled down to the core components of what is means to be human. Granted, not all of that is pretty, but hey, what can ya do? You see this "whittling down" with the other long-lived races too. One could safely assume the Andii weren't always mopey and vague, nor the Jaghut always as esoteric and philosophic. But after such long lives, they are stripped of all the ephemeral nuances that they may have had to leave their core exposed.

And this could evolve into a greater discussion of how this is reflected in the various civilizations (both Malazan and irl) but I won't jump headfirst into that rabbit hole! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kruppe's narration took a moment for me to warm up to - I'll be honest! I think it really comes down to how one feels about Erikson's philosophy. While I certainly feel he's gotten better with it as the series has progressed (and there are some really great moments of philosophy in TtH), there is a glut of it in this book. As someone who studied lit and philosophy in college, I'm just a dog in a manger. However, I can totally see that not being the case for many. (Looking at you, Black Coral chapters!) </TEXT>

They are now in Bastian and Kallor has engaged the kelyk drinkers. Aaaand then chapter change. I love how Nimander's sections are Erikson's chance to just throw in everything plus the kitchen sink.

<TEXT> And then there were three. God damn it, Erikson. You hit them fast and you hit them hard. It's really heartbreaking to watch the remaining Bridgeburners slowly dwindle into fewer and fewer numbers. But my god, what a scene. Points to Erikson for the reference to Whiskeyjack (god damn it, I'm not crying!) and the delicate building of tension throughout the whole intro to the assassination scene through excellent use of pov.

I was a little hesitant to start TtH because so many people knock it for its long-windiness. But with scenes like this one (and tbh, I'm really enjoying Nimander's side plot) this is quickly becoming my favorite book in the series. So much intrique, so many disparate threads that I know will be woven together. And Kruppe - I mean, enough said. I could listen to him ramble all day.

Now excuse me while I go cut some more onions... </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Let it not be said that The Bonehunters is a small book. I recently decided to fold in ICE's books into my reading of SE's series and just finished NoK after reading MT. While I enjoyed NoK, it is truely ICE's GotM and was a little rough around the edges (despite being an enjoyable romp around Malaz City). This was also where I suffered my first case of whiplash (literary whiplash, that is).

I was simply not prepared for how much information ICE tells you straight out. There was little to read between the lines (which is not a bad thing) but switching from SE to ICE was like switching from a manual car to an automatic car. It was smooth and effortless - jarringly so.

Now I'm diving into BH and have gotten whiplash again. Back to a manual car...and I'm sputtering between stops and starts as I get the feel for this vehicle again.  Is this whiplash effect something that will be as prevalent if I continue to fold in ICE's books? I don't expect him to drive the same as SE, but I may give this approach another thought if I'm going to have to relearn how to drive each time I switch authors.

Also, please no spoilers for BH - I'm only through the prologue! </TEXT>

If I understand correctly, they are a bit quicker to read so it will be a nice break from the dense nature of the main series.

<TEXT> Being on the fifth book of the core series, I've fallen into SE's pattern of all plot threads and action building to the fourth section of each book. MT has been a roller coaster and one that has set a new benchmark for me. I also just remembered it's Labor Day weekend so now I'm frantically counting down the hours until I can go home and read what I expect to be a thrilling and yet another epic conclusion.

With all due luck and time on my side, that should leave me with just enough time to plow through most of NoK before returning to work on Tuesday...

To speak a little on MT and just how freakin' awesome this it (and also why, despite some recent conversations on this subreddit, this is a great fifth book and not first book of the series) I've really felt so many of the disparate elements of the series thus far being stitched together.  The Crippled God is finally dragged into the foray and is the most active we've seen him in any of the books thus far. The Tiste Edur are also spotlighted as well as the nature of their fragmented warren. Everything with the Nascent and Silandra are coming together, the First Empire is touched on more deeply here than even in Deadhouse Gates (though a reread post-finishing the series may change that) and we finally meet members of the Crimson Guard. Who, by the way, are awesome.

Everything I've listed above (in my ramshackle manner) has been briefly mentioned or touched on in the series before but MT acts a a big, glorious/gory-ous ribbon cinching them all into the main plot. This is the convergence of convergences for the first five books and I'm excited as hell to read what the last five have to offer.

Finally, because I haven't touched on Tehol and Bugg yet (due to them being new but hopefully long-lasting players in the series...cough cough I have my eye on Bugg - if that's his real name!) let me just say they are freaking awesome. At first, while starting MT, I found the Tiste Edur/Seren sections a bit of a drag and I wanted to get back to the hilarious banter and intrigue of the notorious duo. The rest of the characters and arcs caught up with them in terms awesomeness but Tehol and Bugg (as well as Rucket and Shurq) are some of the best characters SE has written up to this point. 

Anyway, enough with my rambling. Carry on with your regularly scheduled Friday afternoon activities. Nothing to see here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Howdy y'all. I'm in the market for a new tattoo and want to get a simple, clean symbol from the Malazan universe done on my right calf. I currently have the Triforce on my left calf (very basic, thick, clean lines with none of the adorning bells and whistles) and want to balance it out with some sort of symbol from the Malazan universe.

I've only read through MoI (I'm working on HoC right now) so please do not post any ideas that would spoil events later in the series for me. However, if you think of a really good one from a book I haven't read, please let me know that I need to keep reading. I'll visit this post once I've finished that book to hit you up for your idea.

THIS IS WHERE I GET SPOILERY, BUT I MARKED IT IN THE TITLE SO I'M NOT GOING TO TAG IT HERE.

As for my personal journey with the series thus far, I love Duiker (and thusly loved the epilogue of MoI). Ganoes is also one of my faves, as was Detoran (though don't we just love all the Bridgeburners?). The Chain of Dogs really effed me up, as did all of Coral but it was bloody fantastic.

Anyway, thanks in advance and if you could post a image with your post that'd be super duper! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm relatively new to this subreddit and new to the series (started it in Feb and just started HoC today) but I wanted to give a shout out to how awesome this community is. While this could have easily been an elitist subreddit filled with spoiler-dropping jerks, everyone is super aware of newcomers to the series (thanks in a large part to the great spoiler tagging system here).  This subreddit has also been great for venting/letting loose with each emotional catharsis the series throws at us. With no one to turn to in real life (I try to explain the plot and they are like "dinosaurs with swords for hands? whaaat?") this community has been great.

TL;DR - You get an upvote! You get an upvote! Everyone gets an upvote! [Spoiler DG](/s " (Except for you, Rallick Nom. No upvote for you.) EDITED: Fuck you Mallick Rel. Rallick Nom, you're swell.") </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll carry over advice from another thread - binge the last 100ish pages of MoI in one sitting. With some comfort food. And something for snuggles. In the quiet dignity of your own private space.

In other words, so goooood! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh god - I'm still sorting through all the death and destruction. I think one thing that struck me was [MoI Spoiler](/s "the transition from Lady Envy being a fun character to her being frustratingly cold and indifferent to all but her affairs. Her reunion with Picker's forces really tore me up. I hadn't thought I'd connected with Detoran as much as I did and her death was the worst...you know, after all the other major character deaths up to this point.")

Looking back at DG, the end of that book was also pretty traumatic, but Kalam's bits provided a little bit of relief from the Chain of Dogs arc. I never really worry for Kalam, he's just too bad ass. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm reading the series for the first time and just finished MoI on my lunch break today. I am rekt. The conclusion to this book just finished me - fatality. Here's a pro tip for those starting MoI - let yourself binge the last 100 pages all at once in a place where breaking down into uncontrollable sobs and dry heaves is acceptable.

<TEXT> I think a popular hang-up with a live-action adaptation is the sheer volume of casting and the fact that, as the show goes on, it would be hard to hide the aging of the actors. With how dense each book is (and if this hypothetical series is as faithful as we'd like it to be), I think the actors would age far more rapidly than their characters. Additionally, many roles would be put on hold for long periods of time (i.e. Whiskyjack during all of DG) and keeping actors on a retainer like that can be costly and unrealistic.

But don't get me wrong, a live action of this universe (we can dream!) would be bad ass! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently (well, about three months ago) picked the series up and am about 100 pages from the end of MoI. GotM was a good, albeit tough read even for someone used to gluttonously devouring fantasy. I would reckon that NOT having a large familiarity with typical fantasy tropes might be a bonus for this series - you don't become preoccupied in trying to find some form of familiarity to cling to.

If you decided to pick up GotM again, power through. It started to be really rewarding at the halfway point when all the main characters of that book had been introduced and the world started to settle for me. If you make it through to DG, there's a bit of culture shock similar to starting GotM, but to a lesser extent. I found DG, while longer, better written and more focused. MoI only improves this and brings back all the characters you loved from GotM.  If you make it through MoI and still aren't into it, I would probably take a (hard) pass on the series. I know a lot of folks say try to make it through MT, but even three books is a large commitment, much less five.

One additional tip for GotM - much of the beginning of the book takes place in different regions of the world than are provided on the maps. If you are careful to avoid spoilers, there are wikis with maps that can help you at least get your geographic bearings. That was a huge hang-up for me right off the bat - I love my maps! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So some thoughts on the minor arcana, because who doesn't love the minor arcana?  I don't have much reasoning to back these up except my ability to use Wikipedia and I bought a deck of tarot cards once that came with a book. Aka I'm *probably* an expert....

[...so take this with a grain of salt.](#spoiler)

*I'm also going to assume that since the main post was tagged with spoilers and that this tread is discussing tarot in relation to game themes and characters, my post may contain spoilers. So cover your eyes if you're not into that sort of thing!*

**Wands/Clubs/Fire**

Wikipedia tells me this suit is representative of the peasantry, and also of creativity and will. 
In divination, the suit of wands represents the element of fire and gives information relating to the traits of the fire element in astrology. Additionally it represents the peasant or farmer class of feudal society (the Latin suit is commonly called Staves or Rods), and relates to simplicity and to nature, as well as to poverty and submission.

I feel the beastly hunting Yharnamites are well represented by this suit. They are of the lowest rung in Bloodborne and bear the burdens and effects of the major player's actions. If not for the Church and College's quest for eldritch truth, perhaps the Yharnamites would not be in so much pain and suffering.

**Coins/Diamonds/Earth**

Wikipedia tells me this suit is representative of the merchants, and also of material body or possessions. 
In occult and divinatory usage the suit is connected with the classical element of Earth, the physical body and possessions or wealth. Coins as a Latin suit represent the feudal class of traders, and therefore to worldly matters in general. Associated physical characteristics include dark hair and eyes, dark complexion, and sturdy build.

I'm going to go with the nobility of Cainhurst here, though I'm not entirely certain why. Call it a gut feeling/my love for ~~Castlevania~~ this area of Bloodborne. Plus, Queen Annalise and Logharius are both tied to this world for eternity (well, until you kill the Martyr and/or don't revive Annalise after Alfred goes Barry the Butcher on her).

**Cups/Hearts/Water**

Wikipedia tells me this suit is representative of the clergy, and also of emotions and love.
 In tarot, the element of cups is water, and the suit of cups pertains to situations and events of an emotional nature. As such, when the tarot is used in divination, many cups signify an emotional issue or love situation, or some event that affects the querent emotionally. The watery astrological signs are Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces. Additionally, cups were the symbol of the clergy in feudal times, and thus cup cards can also be interpreted as having to do with spiritual or religious matters.

I'm going to go with the obvious interpretation here and have this suit representative of the Healing Church. While we only see the aftermath of the Church's mission in Bloodborne, we have to remember that their quest for Truth and the healing blood started with good intentions. Vicar Amelia reminds me of this each time I fight her - she still prays for the souls of Yharnam up until her ultimate corruption and transformation.

I could also see tying the Byrgenwerth College and Scholars into this because of how intertwined the two factions are. Though they may have split after the schism, it remains clear that both groups sought enlightenment for the greater good.

**Swords/Spades/Air**

Wikipedia tells me this suit is representative of the nobility and military, and also of reason. 
In tarot, swords correspond to the element of Air, and as such signifies freedom but also quick change. The Swords suit also traditionally represented the military, which implies strength, power and authority, but also responsibility, violence and suffering.

The Hunters, the Workshop, and the Powderkegs. Who has the power to cheat death? Who can dodge, dash and dismember like it's going out of style? Who bears the immediate and painful consequences of their actions? Who suffers in the solitude of self-reliance and isolation?  

----------

Anyway, these are my two cents. Feel free to run with them!
