<TEXT> So now that 2016 is drawing to a close I wanted to make a tribute to the scene's storyline over the year (and those preceding it!). I was really really amazed when [Monte came out with his parody lyrics](http://ggcmontecristo.tumblr.com/post/151829351167/i-asked-a-long-time-na-fan-about-league-of#notes) to "Miss American Pie", "NA's Apple Pie" and equally so when TBSkyen posted his [sung rendition of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc8sztpxO34), so I decided to make a music video/montage of sorts set to the song! 

Took about three days to put together, clips mostly taken from reddit, twitter various Riot vods, TSM and C9's Legends/Genesis shows, and a few other vids here and there. Some parts didn't come out as well as I'd like but to do the song justice, but I hope y'all enjoy this little thing. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Zed "rework" helped him achieve his in-lore goal! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-17 06:24:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was reading through some of the lores today with the universe update and was reminded of the fact that Zed has lets just say a bit of a *vendetta* against Jhin.

From [Jhin's lore](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Jhin/Background):
 When they caught Jhin, young Zed marched forward to kill the cowering man, but Kusho held him back.


  Zed, disturbed and haunted by the murder scenes he had witnessed, was unable to understand or accept this mercy, and it is said a resentment began to bloom in his heart.


 "You know what that... thing is capable of." Then Zed leaned over the table, well within Shen's range - his neck intentionally exposed. "And you know that we are the only two people who can get close enough to stop him."


 Shen remembered the first time he'd seen the body of someone killed by the infamous Khada Jhin. His skin prickled from the memory; his teeth clenched. Only his father had been strong enough to still believe a merciful justice could be served. Something in Shen had changed that day. Something in Zed had broken.


 There was still no sign of Zed. It was disappointing. Very disappointing. He certainly must have sought out his former friend. It was likely Zed was hiding, watching. Jhin needed to be careful.

Basically Zed was traumatised by Jhin's actions, swore to kill the guy and is in fact actively hunting him. 

Now, the recent "rework" gave Zed incentive to kill targets with high AD. Due to his passive, Jhin is capable of hitting the highest AD in the game. Indeed, I'm pretty sure the "new Zed" was advertised as being a Jhin counter. I see what you did there Riot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Frosk is also - if you see her post on Reddit (/u/thatchinesefangirl) and elsewhere, very eagerly open to criticism and takes that which is given to her onboard. She may still be subpar to several viewers but it's very obvious she had made an effort to improve and is continuing to do so. LS is very much the same analyst he was 2 years ago and does not take to criticism well - he often just goes on saying the same thing without considering what has been put to him (as seen with him repeating things after Alex Ich disagreed AND appeared to be right based on what happened in game). Goes a long way toward the perception of a person. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Or rather, today I remembered :P.

Been seeing a lot of discussion in the community recently about how all four of the above champions have extremely powerful kits that cause them to dominate the meta and crowd out other champs in their roles if their numbers are even remotely decent (and often refuse to fall off even when they're nerfed because of the utility of their kits) and it made me think "huh weren't they all released in 2014" and then I realised all four were released within months of each other. Makes me wonder just what Riot was thinking with their design philosophy at the time and how it's shaped their philosophies going forward.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Suggestion: Work the new solo/dynamic/team stamps into S6 Ranked Reward Borders </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-18 11:37:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This year Riot added special markings to signify division in ranked borders, so how about adding something else that signifies the queue preference? Something like three little beads at the top for dynamic, 5 for team, 1 for solo etc, so you can tell how that person earned their rank - by being a good solo player or a good premade player or whatever. 

Probably won't further increase toxicity than the stamps themselves will and will allow solo players to feel rewarded for their SOLO achievement. While it won't do anything to improve the solo experience, it sorta helps diversify reward into two ladders (a big complaint is solo players feeling they're being disproportionately rewarded for their play).

Also, aware that people might just try to play the majority of their final 25 games in the season solo to avoid getting a dynamic border but if the player is truly boosted and doesn't belong at that level they will drop in elo over 25 games so it'll still be a more accurate mark of their solo ranking.

Obviously won't apply to bronze but it's not like a solo bronzie is going to feel any worse seeing that other people with premades are also bronze. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When the heck did I call it a cure? I said it was an escape, and there is nothing wrong with using (harmless - compared to other options like self-harm or substance abuse) escapes especially when you're dealing with something for which it feels like there's no cure in sight. The fact of the matter is it's an effective escape meaning a lot of the players are people struggling with that kind of thing, and it's foolish for Riot to implement things that alienate people who are struggling because that's their playerbase. Also I disagree - you can learn to communicate and be decent when socializing without feeling like you have to be part of any sort of consistent group.  </TEXT>

Of other players who have played in all splits, Dlift missed a few for CLG's ill-fated S4 korean boot camp and Zion missed a week due to a suspension in S5. He also holds the record for most splits played signed to a single team ([source](http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/LCS_Players)) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The whole argument that "teams like DIG being in the LCS just makes other teams complacent" is hilarious because one of the things DIG was actually *good* at historically was punishing complacency. You can argue that dig didn't strive for anything beyond mediocrity but how many times did they upset teams who underestimated them? The ol' "dig upset telling another team they need to get their shit together" that happened more than once every split was one of my favorite staples of every season and why I'm sad to see them go. Getting rid of DIG is not going to make NA better. They may have not been a top tier team at any point but they were never a team to just roll over and die to a top team that wasn't trying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually this happened to me too. On OCE and hit G5 at the end of last year, last week over easter break I decided to grind back up and spent a lot of time in s1 where I feel like I equalized my MMR (ended up against mostly s1/g5 players in my non-series games and had ~20lp gains and losses.) When I got to promos however I kept being placed against (and only against, never on my team) high gold or even plat players. And I did promos 4 times before I got into gold thanks to the promo helper giving me two free wins and a lucky afk on the enemy team in a third game. I figured that this type of sudden mmr jump must have just been normal in promos and brushed it off - is it not intentional? </TEXT>

Multiple members of both teams looked sloppy but UoL made the first mistake and it landed OG with a lead on their core player (like the casters remarked Ori and Kindred could do fuck all but keep Zven alive and OG would still take any fight) and that conveniently won them the game. IF next game it's OG who makes the first mistake, I could also see the reverse happen. Looks like the only thing I can call at this point is that it looks like it's going to be a sloppy series. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not necessarily true. The top 6 teams in points overall will have a shot at Worlds (2 autoqualify + 4 go to gauntlet). Won't get into the math but barring a very weird situation (where 3+ teams that aren't even in playoffs this split somehow manage to take top playoffs positions next split) the loser of this game will still at least get to run gauntlet provided can make summer playoffs. Of course they'll probably have a low gauntlet seeding, but as C9 proved last year, if they deserve to go to Worlds at that point they ought take the opportunity to prove it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Quinn's new blind mechanic feels 10x more frustrating and oppressive to play against than the old one. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-01 08:13:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Riot removed the old mechanic because they felt it to be a low counterplay frustration feature, but it feels like they replaced it with something that just makes that frustration worse? Previously the blind only stopped you from autoing, the new blind *still* stops you from autoing because unless the Quinn player is an idiot they're not going to remain in your vision range, so you can't click on them. But now you can't even use targeted abilities, aim skillshots, anticipate incoming skillshots or abilities or get a feel for what your team is doing and hers is around you (which arguably makes this one of the most powerful forms of CC as even when you're stunned, you can anticipate what's coming and make decisions as to your next move accordingly)...or do anything really, until it wears off (at least in the case of Graves's smokescreen you can walk out of it unless you are chain cc'd). It's extremely frustrating to play against and I'm not sure what Riot was thinking when they took away the old blind for the reasons stated and then replaced it with this. 

I understand that it's in the form of an avoidable skillshot so that exists as counterplay, but the old blind was too so what's Riot's logic in saying that that was unhealthy to the game and this isn't? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is that low elo games tend to be messy bloodfests with a lot of kills because of the way people greed and bloodthirst - it's actually not that hard to stack devourer in low elo by ganking or just playing in the same way a low elo ganking jungler would do. That's why it's so strong in low elo. Best way to balance it would be to remove devourer stacking off kills altogether and make it a purely farm stacking item, enforcing the "farm for your reward, punish the guy for farming by ganking early game" playstyle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah true, her win rate might go down with duskblade's launch we'll see. I still don't think she's as vulnerable in laning phase as she's said to be though, people who run a defensive summoner and know how to abuse her range and manage the wave won't be overextending or susceptible to ganks too easily unless the enemy can well coordinate dives. In lategame teamfights maybe she can be picked off but the general Lux pattern seems to be to just stand way back and poke until something worthwhile hits. It's hard to get in and assassinate her without it being a 1v5 suicide mission. </TEXT>

Same thing goes for Lux right now (this is speaking as someone who both plays against her and abuses the freelo when I do get her) - you can miss all your Qs but the nature of her combo and scaling is that the moment she hits one on you once she's level 6, that's the lane lost, or later in the game, the entire game lost due to the long as hell death timers. She just seems way too low risk high reward right now, hence the high win rate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> His storyline is a fucking awesome underdog narrative, could be a movie plot, if you read it from start til now. He was bouncing around challenger for a couple of seasons before Curse Academy picked him up at the *last second* for the expansion tournament (a one-off qualifier mind you) to replace Cris after they failed to defeat CLG (by one game) in the relegation tournament. Rule changes then meant that CA had to be sold to an organization with minimal infrastructure, and while Gravity did decently all things given Hauntzer was generally regarded as the [worst top laner NA](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJwsYB_UMAAWyLL.jpg:large) after his first split. In summer his team did better (only to come to a crashing fall) but he was overshadowed by teammates and generally only remarked upon for whiffing some clutch ults. But one person did notice the diamond in the rough, none other than someone he admired a lot - NA's most stalwart, but fading veteran Dyrus who just so happened to need a replacement and that's how Hauntzer found himself on NA's most iconic and arguably most successful team, a move that was met with a lot of negativity especially given aside from him TSM had assembled an all-star lineup. And now we've got this, the guy is possibly the best member of the team so far this season. Honestly you can't ask for a better script. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Note, this isn't a complaint thread, just me noting what will be an interesting shift from the current state of things where getting stuck being last pick repeatedly is generally the least desired position. 

Going into the new champ select, Riot decided to give the bans to the last three picks (3, 4, 5) with the intention of making champ select fairer but thinking about it, with how roles are now going to be decided before anyone even enters champ select there's no longer going to be much advantage to being an early pick in ranked - first pick no longer gives you the benefit of role selection (as you'd have already chosen your role) or bans and instead the earlier you pick the more likely you're forced to blind pick your matchup and are going to end up getting countered. The only advantage I can think of is you may get a chance to first pick an OP champ but this is something I rarely see done in solo queue at present and people tend to just ban away OPs anyway.  </TEXT>

For some once it's gone it's gone, for others it goes for a bit and then comes back. But regardless (and this is speaking as someone who did suffer it in high school and from talking to others who've been through the same) when you have depression you genuinely feel like it's going to be there forever.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The synergy issue might also be a 'shoved together this roster with like a week's notice' problem too (CLG have had HuHi and Stixxay around all season even if not playing, TSM is in a similar boat admittedly but at least the management was always aware the team would be attending IEM and as you mentioned, the infrastructure is better). UoL still have the whole break to get it together - hopefully the management can work out those kinks. I want them to succeed : ( </TEXT>

<TEXT> UoL were at least playing a little better the second time. I always liked the team because they seemed a good natured lovable organization and while the first game was disappointing I'm not going to worry just yet because they showed a bit of improvement between the games and honestly they were invited at the last minute and probably put together this roster/had to switch back to practicing on this patch on just as short notice. At least Hyli/Gillius/Vici are showing a propensity to make plays (need to learn to do it in a way that doesn't mean overextending and dying though. That's a teamplay problem they should work on). Hopefully Fox and Steelback can wake up (I know they were...better in spring split) and the team spends the break working on establishing an actual shotcalling system (they don't have the raw talent to just rely on brute force 'chaos style' anymore) and get it together. I believe in Unicorns. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, yeah I wasn't trying to rush to any conclusions, by 'has the cards' I meant he has all the attributes of a solid top laner (not afraid to go for plays when he sees the opportunity, good laner (showing good lane mechanics vs Acorn/Flame individually have little to do with LGD as a team), not reckless, good map awareness and teamplayer) which if he keeps it up, has the potential to hold up internationally. Maybe that wasn't clear haha. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He *was* Dyrus style in that he did exactly everything his team needed him to at all times - he didn't try to be a primary carry or play forward in a way that felt like he had a 'got the team on my shoulders' mentality, he did what he had to for the team. But the difference was he is still proactive and when an opportunity to make an outplay surfaces, he sees it and takes it. He has a great mentality and the fact that he held onto it despite being the only player in that game with 0 international experience is huge! I'm glad to say NA may finally have a top laner who has all the cards to hold a candle to KR ones. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Given he's the only guy here without any international experience, Hauntzer is playing really solidly, not afraid to go for the outplays but not going recklessly ham either - good mentality. Very impressed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How does ingame elo have anything to do with whether people vote along the lines of their favorite players or the most skilled players? That's just a personal preference, you can be bronze (or not even have an interest in playing ranked yourself) and still be interested in seeing high level plays, or you could be Diamond and a lot of your interest in the game is thanks to one personality (irrespective of his skill) and you want to see him at the event. Nice shitpost/10. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess partly because Hauntzer's security is conditional on how KaSing does. If KaSing retains his spot (likely) I doubt they'd switch Hauntzer cause there's nobody better in NA (and top has to be NA). So see how KaSing goes and go from there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This. I can't think of a player who IMPROVED (not necessarily the best in the end but the one that got the most noticably better than they were at the start) over last season as Hauntzer, him being young and showing that propensity is a good thing. Remember not every player comes into the scene a star - Sneaky started off not doing anything but playing Ashe so he could ult for the rest for the rest of the team, now he's often considered a top Western AD. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What other Rookie did better though? There were a couple of them who had a couple of really good games here and there but I think Move did shine for a good portion of the season and when he *did* his team was number one. He did fall off (hard, mind you) towards the end but he definitely has the potential to play really well and showcased it more than other Rookies this split. In his prime he was fun to watch, I hope he manages to regain his form. Hoping this was maybe just a bad meta for him/inexperience choking. </TEXT>
